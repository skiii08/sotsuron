The Incredible Hulk," Back to Familiar Ground
","As many know, Ang Lee and Eric Bana tried to do a Hulk movie in 2003. It didn't work. Brooding and arty with limited action. So this time around they went for a 'reboot' - new director and cast and approach. For other movies, the word 'reboot' means an update from what we've seen before. For 'The Incredible Hulk', reboot simply means getting back to the basics - more action and a brisk and easy to follow story. In other words, this aims to be be meat and potatoes and that is what it is.This movie offers up much that is good and solid but not spectacular. The plot is simply designed to enable what we want to see. Nearly all the cast do fine. I wouldn't mind seeing them reprise their parts in any future movies. However, I'm not 100 percent sold on Edward Norton as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. He's a fine actor and there's nothing wrong with his acting here. It's just his approach to the character. Bruce here is quite solemn and repressed. He seems to be thinking deeply about his predicament, but not really in a battle to control his rage. Therefore, it never really feels like a smooth transition whenever he transforms into the Hulk. His chemistry with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross is pretty good though.On the action front, the film is very good. It gives us what we want to see. A whole lotta Hulk Smash! The finale is definitely kickass and The Hulk versus The Abomination delivers. The film ends fairly abruptly after that. Now that we've had two movies in close succession basically introducing The Hulk and the major characters, now is the time to move on and start pushing this series into high gear.",7,2,3,31 October 2008
Mission: Impossible III," An Extended Episode of Alias
","Where I stand on MI. Mission Impossible 1: Very cool. MI2: Stop switching faces! Ethan and Thandie Newton should go on mushy double date with Anakin and Amidala.Where I stand on JJ Abrams. Alias: Often good but unbelievable, I'm more a '24' fan. Lost: Often great but I've stopped watching it. Put them together and you have Mission Impossible 3Abrams is a competent and experienced entertainer used to this sort of material: twists, guns, spies, gadgets, villains, devices that could destroy the world, secrets, lies etc. He constantly keeps things moving and interesting. On the other hand, focusing mainly on Alias here, his stuff is sometimes hard to swallow even for action TV. To me, Abrams is kind of old-school in the way he often skips over plausibility to set up the action or drama spectacle he really wants to focus on. Characters endure extreme conditions and combat and come out with barely a scratch on them, they globe-trot everywhere at a moment's notice and only run into realistic obstacles if it is convenient to the story. On Alias, haven't you noticed that Sydney (Jennifer Garner) has to change into 1001 different costumes to remain undercover, while Vaughn pretty much only changes his accent? Maybe I sound kind of stuffy here but this stuff irritates me.In MI3, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now engaged to Julie (Michelle Monaghan, lovely) when he is pulled back into the line of fire to retrieve his former pupil Agent Farris (Keri Russel, who looks cool with a gun) from mean arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing standard bad guy). The rest of the movie is a cat and mouse game with Davian, who wants to gain access to a nasty weapon and hit Hunt where it hurts. MI3 feels like an extended episode of Alias. It does not feel cohesive but quite episodic (gee, wonder why?) sort of split into 3 sections characterised by a major action sequence. The action is sometimes pretty great, but generally not spectacular. Nothing to match the tension of the first movie's famous CIA infiltration. The cast is fine, and Tom Cruise has a really cool run, nice high knees and fluid arm action. Head looking straight ahead... There is some more swapping faces stuff that doesn't seem as annoying as it was in MI2. Overall, the story is pretty basic stuff. BTW ever since 'Match Point' I've always thought Jonathan Rhys Meyer, playing one of Hunt's team here, would make a really good James Bond. He's dark, handsome, from Ireland (like Brosnan), is only 30 y.o. and does dangerous and confident well. Not that I want Daniel Craig (see my Casino Royale review) replaced but maybe in the future?",6,1,2,24 June 2007
Minority Report," 'Careful, Chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.'
","'Minority Report' is gripping and intelligent for most of the film but the impact falls away towards the end.First of all, the premise is cool and so is the way the film handles everything. We all know Spielberg is a capable and quality filmmaker and the whole pre-crime concept is introduced and explained well. There are nice touches here and there such as 'conducting' the search for the murderer. Its true that some aspects of this film like plot devices and technical choices (all films agree that the future will have cold, blue light) are kind of standard and not that original. Not only that but red herrings like new alphabet letters and pills that make time pass faster were promised beforehand.... However, this doesn't really rankle that much. Spielberg doesn't go overboard on the futuristic gadget stuff but concentrates on the characters/story instead.What's irritating, though, is that some of the plot turns are inconsistent and fairly implausible. I mean, at the start we're told the pre-cogs can only see murder because murder is what most affects the metaphysical universe, however the filmmakers don't stick to this rule later on.However, As Anderson hurtles towards the future murder he is accused of, the film is mostly tense, thoughtful and gripping. Some of the best scenes don't have to do with chase scenes but character interaction such as Anderton's meeting in the greenhouse and a discussion about his son later on. Unfortunately, after the main event, the film becomes sort of unnecessary and overblown. The ending (concerning pre-crime) isn't very believable at all when you think about it. The early 21st century films - 'AI: Artificial Intelligence,' 'Catch Me if you Can,' and this one seem to be good/great Spielberg. Its nice to see him back at the top of his game, though, with the absolutely heart-stopping 'War of the Worlds,' and the extremely intelligent, respectful and courageous 'Munich.' Spielberg's usual pals in cinematography, score and editing do nice work here but nothing that will blow you away. Cruise does a fairly good job but sometimes seems stretched in some scenes - his 'War of the Worlds' performance is much better. The acting star of the film is Samantha Morton as pre-cog Agatha. She shudders, gasps and sees murder over and over again with wide eyes and raw believability. Colin Farrell also shows smarmy promise here.In conclusion, a great Spielberg film would probably be considered a triumph for most other people. I recommend you watch this film.PS: One last thing. If you were Anderton, wouldn't the best thing to do to clear your name be to hide out somewhere and lock the door? That probably wouldn't make for a very interesting film, though, would it?",7,2,4,21 June 2007
Insomnia," Good but not a classic.
","Al Pacino, as we all know, is a fine actor. Michael Corleone. Frank Serpico. Richard Roma. 'Lefty' Ruggiero. Did I mention Michael Corleone. Yes? Oh well. Michael Coreleone.Not that his Detective Will Dormer is as memorable as these guys but its still a nice performance. Some memorable scenes like the phone call to the widow. This is slow burning Pacino for those who think he just does too much Foghorn Leghorn these days - bellowing and waving his arms. (I'm divided on the subject but admit he can go over the top).Plot outline: The Alaskan sun is pretty much up all the time and Dormer has to deal with a murder investigation/cagey murder suspect while not getting any sleep. To sum it up, this will keep you interested. Christopher Nolan is a talented guy and sets the mood pretty well - shots of chilly landscape constantly lit with light - and keeps the story ticking over. I thought Robin Williams was good in his change of pace role, as a calm and icy suspect and had good chemistry with Pacino. My friend still thought he wasn't dark enough. In the end though, they don't take the concept far enough and you're not left very satisfied. It pretty much goes where you suspect it to go and then just ends. Watchable but not a classic. Good for a Saturday arvo.",7,0,0,23 September 2006
Yes Man," Average movie? ... YES MAN! YES MAN!
","Carrey is Carl Allen, a man, who says 'no' to everything after breaking up with his gf (or fiancée? I can't remember). He stumbles upon a growing group of peoplee, who live their lives by not saying YES to EVERYTHING. Carl decides to become a Yes! man. Carrey has consistently made me laugh over the years, but I'm sorry to say, through the whole movie he just looked bored. He just gave off the vibe that he'd rather be somewhere else. While Carrey and many of the scenes are still funny, a lot of the fun is drained out as you realise the script simply exists to throw up as many random slapstick moments as possible without really exploring the idea of a man, who is not allowed to say 'no.' Or, for that matter, an entire wave of people who can't say 'no.' I found myself squirming in my seat before things got even more stale in the final third. On one hand the complications were welcome because the movie had just been going for so long without looking at the consequences of Carl's actions. On the other, it's the same stale, formulaic complications, lines and realisations we knew this movie had to have but were praying for something fresher.",6,0,2,26 March 2009
Crash," You Thought You Had All the Answers ...
","'Crash' is a film of many intersecting lives charged with racial conflict in Los Angeles, California. It won the 2005 Oscar for Best Picture.Crash is one of those films that tries to seriously tackle a big issue from all sides, through many different characters and multiple plot lines. One of the negative raps 'Crash' has received is that it relies on unlikely co-incidences in some plot developments. Some people don't agree with this, but I did get this feeling. Some of the meetings between the various characters are quite unlikely by themselves, and the whole thing isn't helped by introducing all the main characters at the start and then just having them interact only with each other through the whole long film without introducing anyone else noteworthy. In other words, it feels like Los Angeles is only populated by these people, making their surprise interactions even more jarring as the plot twists and turns ... and twists some more.The film's tagline, said at one point by Matt Dillon's cop, is 'you think you know who you are? You have no idea.' And the film gets this point across at various instances by repeatedly scratching the surface of its characters. The victim becomes the bigot, the bigot discovers underlying humanity etc. Its a simple message, of course: scratch the surface (the colour of a person's skin) and you'll find depth.The film is entertaining enough and the tone is pretty much what you would expect from the above description - empathetic, serious, dramatic conflict and self discovery. The acting is good with Don Cheadle displaying a Morgan Freeman ability to make us feel what is going on underneath his sombre, still exterior. Thandie Newton gets the biggest scenes and crackles with intensity. Overall its good - there's one scene (impenetrable cloak) in the middle that gave me goosebumps and is now one of my favourite movie moments - but occasionally kind of florid and a little bit amateurish. Oh, and for the record, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a much better, focused film than this and should have won the Best Pic award.",7,2,5,9 September 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Despite the Warnings From the Faun, You'll Want to Eat and Drink This Film
","In Fascist Spain, 1944, Ofelia and her pregnant mother travel to live with the mother's new husband, the cold and brutal Captain Vidal of the Spanish Army. As he fights the rebels, and her mother suffers, Ofelia is drawn into a fairytale world, where she is told that she is a princess and must complete tasks to return to where she rightfully belongs.I can see why many love this film, and it has many positives. Technically its absolutely gorgeous - the music is haunting, and the cinematography of the 'real' world and the 'fairytale' world seamlessly compliment each other. The art direction is beautifully imaginative but never overkill. At its heart is a fantastic central performance by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia. And she's not one of these teenagers who just looks young either - she was only about 11 when they shot this. She rarely puts a foot wrong and makes you believe everything she's going through. She's the glue that holds it all together.The main problem I had with this film is that it takes a while to warm up. Half way through, the film still felt like it was setting things up rather than moving forward. It felt frustrating and I was worried that this would turn out to be like writer/director Guillermo del Toro's 'Hellboy,' where I felt that not enough happened to sustain the movie. That it would be all a tease.But the film gets better and simply casts a spell on you. Captain Vidal is such a violent, temperamental asshole that you can completely understand why Ofelia retreats so readily into fairy tales and the world of the Labyrinth. The more committed filmgoers will argue whether or not the fairytale world is 'real' or not, but the rest of us can be content with the knowledge that its real if the girl believes its real. Personally, I think it all was really real but I'm a bit of a sap. The ending is perfect and one of those that you can revel in.This is not really for kids because of the violence and the maturity of some of the themes. But if you're an adult, don't be put off by the idea of giant toads and underground worlds. The magic in this is totally character driven and that makes it all the more special.",8,2,5,9 September 2007
Horrible Bosses," As Homer Simpson once said, 'Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American dream?'
","3 nice guys have horrible bosses - lets call them sleazebag, slutty and heartless bastard. Pushed to the edge, they decide to rid the world of their evil masters for the good of mankind.Which is a great premise. But its actually a pretty hard needle for the film to thread. Firstly, the three nice guy leads aren't very engaging. They're too nice and not well fleshed out at all. It seemed totally out of character for them to want to commit murder. Sure, sleazebag and heartless bastard are assholes, but they're actually funnier (especially Colin Farrell) and more entertaining than the nice guys. And, there's no way I want Jennifer Anitson's deliciously kinky slutbag dentist knocked off. As two of the nice guys say to the third - 'your situation will never get any sympathy out of us.' She's actually the best thing in the movie. Its funny in parts, and becomes more interesting later on, as the plot starts to twist and turn. But the constant hysterical dude chatter is kind of tiring. Like 'The Other Guys' although that film was better.",Null,23,46,13 September 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," The Year of the Peacock Begins Now!!!
","Po has settled into his role as the Dragon Warrior (although, lets face it - Tigress could destroy this guy in her sleep), and things are peaceful. Until a villainous peacock named Shen (Gary Oldman) pops up with a machine that can destroy kung-fu and plans to conquer all of China with it.I loved the first film and this is a worthy sequel. It was always going to be hard (impossible?) to recapture the constant wonder of the first film, when we all had no idea how the hell tubby fanboy Po would ever defeat Tai Lung and fulfill his destiny. But kudos to the filmmakers for not restingon their laurels and coming up with a moving story, where Po has to confront buried childhood demons.The good news is that the film is funny, entertaining, and moving. A scene or two really tug at the heartstrings. There are some cool new characters voiced impeccably by Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh and others. And the old favourites do well too. And, like the first, the film is respectful of Asian culture and martial arts.The downsides are pretty minor. Shen's WMD (actually many of them) is a bit goofy, but provides a nice set piece at the end. The action scenes are more generic and don't match the first films ones (the bridge, the training, Tai Lung's great escape, Po vs Tai Lung). But overall fans of the original will be very satisfied with this. Bring on the third!!!",Null,1,2,6 August 2011
Tropic Thunder," Sour and Flat Jungle Juice
","'Tropic Thunder' just isn't that funny. The start is good - funny fake movie trailers for the three leads (Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey jnr) and a huge, expensive screw-up on the set. But the main plot of the movie - the actors are dropped off in the middle of the jungle and filmed with hidden cameras and recording equipment to capture their authentic reactions - is just too stupid for words. What kind of movie studio would throw away a truckload of money by having its actors spend most of their time wandering around a jungle, only stopping occasionally to follow the script and deliver their lines? With nobody to direct them? And how did the production team place all that recording equipment around the jungle without ever running into the villains that the actors eventually encounter? Some may think I'm taking this too seriously, but the goofy plot put a big dent in the movie for me. They should have continued with making the war movie the way they did at the beginning. Apart from some comic bright spots - Stiller's 'Simply Jack' moments and his encounter with the thing he loves most in the world are hilarious - there's just not much else that is funny. I'm not a huge Jack Black fan, but I think we can all agree his characters was a weak link and a giant waste of space. Downey's white turned black actor was moderately funny, and I think Tom Cruise's performance is just one of those things people think that they're supposed to love - to me, it just highlighted how unsuited to the role he was. Heck, he showed twice as much viciousness and intensity in 'Magnolia.' A pretty lazy, unfocused and corny romp in the jungle. 'Tropic Blunder' indeed.",4,1,2,26 March 2009
Children of Men," It Had Potential to be More About Ideas
","The year is 2027 and no one has had a kid since 2009. Consequently, the human race is doomed. Emotions are running high and everywhere the world is falling apart. Conflict, despair, chaos and decay are everywhere. The premise is introduced very well as everywhere people are mourning the death of the world's youngest person - watching the future disappear before their eyes.This film does convey the look and feel of the above quite well through credible character exchanges and technical work. However, the film's potential is hampered by the story - Theo (Clive Owen) trying to secretly transport a miraculously pregnant woman to the shadowy 'The Human Project,' who they have to trust have her best interests at heart as opposed to the openly brutal and corrupt government. Because all of this has to be hidden from the public's eye, the film's potential to explore this extraordinary development is limited to speculation by the small band of people who come to know that the girl is pregnant. So while the decaying world is continually depicted credibly, the film can't really grow and thematically build on its premise.So the film mainly becomes a chase film - trying to transport the girl somewhere while avoiding detection from all sides. This takes away from the uniqueness of the premise and makes the film seem more routine than it should have been. I have to say, though, that the last 30 minutes is quite thrilling as the stakes have been raised so much. The camera following the progress of Theo through the torn-up streets as bullets fly everywhere is a gripping. But for those who want to see this film with the purpose of having grand philosophical discussions afterwards, you'll probably come out disappointed. The film does have things to say, but could have been more. Finally, a couple of things deserve a special mention. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is just outstanding as he throws everything in the book at you - constantly inventive camera work, smoke, light, shade, saturation - so that many of the scenes you just want to frame on your wall. Also, a recurring musical theme from John Tavener's 'Fragments of a Prayer' is also very memorable and fits well.",6,12,19,17 June 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Strong and solid. 8 / 10.
","When the Oscars rolled around, I had seen 'The Aviator' and was rooting for Martin Scorsese to finally win an Oscar. Instead, as your probably know, Eastwood won his second directing Oscar and so it took me a while to watch this film. Not that I ever expected it to be bad. I enjoyed 'Mystic River' and everyone is talking about Clint's new creative surge in his old age. If he keeps on making movies like 'Mystic' and 'Million,' I just might forgive him for 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' one day. :)If you haven't seen this movie, you've probably heard some general offhand comments about it. 1) It's very moving. 2) The ending is not what you expect. 3) Eastwood dusts off his acting muscles and turns it up.Well it is moving. The last part takes a different turn and hits you in the stomach. Some may feel the ending is overly manipulative but I was able to get past it. The movie hinges on Maggie (Swank) and Frank's (Eastwood) interaction. As the movie draws to a close you really get sucked in as the story drives towards the grand finale.The movie has boxing but is mainly about characters. Three people feeling the sands of time slipping through the hourglass for each of them and handling it in different ways. Some scenes - Frank in church, Dupris' (Freeman) 'people die every day' speech - really stick in your memory and heart. Everything about this film - the actors (Swank especially), the pacing, the script and the dialogue - float like a butterfly yet sting like a bee. This film is a wonderful examination of how glory and failure are often a heartbeat away from each other. Such is sport. Such is life.And just one small comment. If you're holding back in seeing this film because you've heard some feminist grumblings, then you don't really have anything to fear. I can see why some are a bit annoyed but the movie is strong, respectful and emotionally mature.",8,0,1,27 November 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Some Nice Flourishes, But Pretty Flat.
","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' starts off well, has a long and flat mid-section and comes together again at the end. Since I know the story, I wasn't very interested when each kid was being disposed of one by one. It was extremely faithful to the book during this section and there were no surprises. Even the art-direction and costumes just seemed to blend into a bright and gaudy blur after a while. Ho hum.As for the acting, Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket shows that he's a dependable guy. However, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka misses the mark. Sure he's odd, and I think people appreciated that his interpretation was seemingly original, but his performance is very similar to what he did in 'Ed Wood.' It's not really the same in tone but more in wide-eyed mannerisms. Depp's moments of deep disdain for the kids were a nice touch, but I also liked Gene Wilder's deadpan indifference in the original movie. The oompa loompas were just annoying, and it doesn't help that Danny Elfman isn't much of a songwriter. Sure he's done some good ones - ie 'This is Halloween' from 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' - but he's much better at just composing the score.Like I said, the beginning was interesting. Burton puts in many nice flourishes and it was interesting to see how he was adapting the book. The tone, props, characters and sets were fine. Like I said, the middle will really drag to those who know how each kids goes. The ending goes off in a direction that gives it a tad more narrative continuity.",5,3,6,18 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," An Expensive Mess
","To whom it may concern, I also reviewed 'HP and the Goblet of Fire' and gave it 8 stars. Read it if you like because I sort of touch on the same issues here.As we know, the first few Potter films were widely criticised for being absolutely stuffed with everything from the books. As the books got longer, though, it would be inevitable that heavy trimming would have to be done. They did well with 'Goblet of Fire.' They didn't do well here.Remember the threesome scene in 'A Clockwork Orange?' The mechanical and acrobatic sex captured as if it was in fast-forward? This is what this movie is like. The whole name of the game here is expediency and efficiency. A lot of the major scenes from the book are here except they are whittled down to the shortest time possible and include only a couple of lines. There's no build up or pleasure. Potter has his Arthur Weasley vision and 30 seconds later Shacklebolt is saying 'You can't deny, Dumbledore's got style.' Yet nearly everything stylish about Dumbledore's escape in the scene has been cut. All the fun has been drained out just so everything can be crammed in. The task of trying to balance making a good movie and put in everything essential to the whole Potter mythology has clearly taken its toll. Though I was able to keep up, the casual movie-goer by now is going to be hard-pressed keeping up with all the talk about prophecies, floo-networks and Padfoots.So because of the overriding tone of speed, slash and burn, I couldn't enjoy the story, and therefore, the film. As for the good points: This is a major franchise movie and the money put into it clearly shows. Art direction like the Ministry of Magic and the Department of Mysteries is glorious to behold, but even here, there is a sense of overkill. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort would have been much better if it was like in the book but here its a huge amount of flashing sparks. As for the acting, all the main actors are quite comfortable in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe has improved a lot though I don't think he'll ever entirely banish the wood from his performances. What is most pleasing about the entire film is the new characters. Imelda Staunton is most entertaining as Dolores Umbridge, and the chick who plays Luna Lovegood did her perfectly. I smiled every time she was on screen. And Helena Bonham Carter has a lot of fun as deranged sexy death eater Bellatrix Lestrange. Marry me, Ms. Carter, I'll be good to you.4/10. Don't bother seeing it. And good luck to the people who have to put the 6th and 7th books on the screen. They'll need it.",4,10,18,5 August 2007
Drag Me to Hell," Great Title
","Christine (Alison Lohman) rejects a creepy old gypsy woman for an extension on her payments for her house, thus evicting her. The gypsy woman magically retaliates and Christine must find a way to avoid being dragged to...I don't watch much horror, but the great title got me and the word was the Sam Raimi had left behind the stodginess of Spiderman3. In terms of plot it's all pretty straight-forward stuff, but the film was spoilt for me by Alison Lohman's patchy performance. She's fine in non-horror sequences, and even does scared well sometimes, but often her reactions just don't seem convincing. If you were trapped under a dead body with embalming fluid being vomited down your throat, you might seem a bit more distraught when you finally escaped, But Christine's hair is more ruffled than she is.The horror isn't bad, but is isn't until near the end that the movie starts to become a lot more fun.",Null,1,3,28 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Worth seeing. Much better than the first three.
","The Harry Potter books are wonderful. You should read them, no matter what age you are. I can pick any one of them up, open a page and start reading.As for the movies, first one, dull and overcooked; second one, a bit better but still overcooked; third one, a bit better than the last one. Steve Kloves - writer, just wants to stuff everything in when more cutting is required. Thankfully, his script is much tighter in this one.This movie is darker, edgier and much more satisfying. For a start, the kids are much better. In the first three they weren't very good. In fact, I would argue with people that they should replace Daniel Radcliffe as I thought he was bad to the point of distraction. Now I know they're young and I'm not expecting Haley Joel Osment here but just a little naturalness. But in this film they are all much improved. With the Yule ball and all that talk of hormones and the slowly growing love thing between Ron and Hermione, I thought it would be embarrassing but it was okay.The movie was faithful to the book and the pace was very good. However, a few changes could have made to make this an excellent movie.Firstly, Dumbledore is too angry and emotional. They're obviously trying to make it more dramatic but those who know him know he's actually quite a serene character nearly all the time. Thoughtful, wise and stately. Michael Gambon (The Cook, the thief, his wife, and her lover)is a good actor but he's still a bit short and round for the part.They should have really cut down on the dragon scene. It's way too drawn out and unbelievable.They should have buffed up the big resurrection scene (you know what I'm talking about). Not much sense of occasion here. This is THE absolutely huge event in the Potter series and all it is is a bunch of flashing lights and its over. Again, as in all the movies, a feeling of not knowing what to condense and what to expand. Where's the breeze rustling the leaves of the yule trees and the creepy build up? They could have really bought this home.Ralph Fiennes' interpretation. I really like Fiennes and a lot of people praised his performance. But, like Dumbledore, they made him too emotional. He snarled and spat and screamed while his character is actually more calm, cold, intelligent and menacing. This guy is like a nutter escaped from an asylum. When I say Ralph's interpretation, maybe I should be saying Mike Newell's.They should have cut Rita Skeeter. Not worth it. Loved Miranda Richardson in Black Adder. Maybe she should have played Professor Trelawney ... or Narcissa Malfoy. There's a thought.Anyway, these are mostly criticism but it is only because the movie is already so entertaining and so satisfying that they rankle that bit more. As I speak they've already cast Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange - good job. They must have seen her sexy performance in 'Fight Club.'",8,1,2,23 September 2006
30 Days of Night," 30 Days of Shi...e
","The premise is cool: A remote Alaskan town has 30 days without any sunlight - '30 Days of Night.' A group of vampires come to town to take advantage of this. Eventually, we follow a small group of survivors as they try and stay alive until the 30 days are up. However, the cool premise is taken away by the fact that the filmmakers have no idea how to handle it. It may as well have been called '3 or 4 Days of Night' since we keep lurching forward in time with hardly anything changing for any of the characters.The film is bad because it simply has its priorities wrong. Its main priorities are: sick gore (a blunt axe takes about 6 swings to chop a head off), and people hiding from the vampires. What it isn't concerned with: people battling vampires to stay alive. The vampires are cool, no question. They dress in dark clothing, look fantastically warped, screech and speak a strange language. The main problem is that they are so much stronger than the humans. The vampires can do anything. Watch them stop speeding cars, run faster than the eye can see, take bullets and keep on coming .... therefore, any confrontation with the humans can only end one way - with the humans being overwhelmed and killed as brutally and bloodily as possible. So the main action of the film is hiding from the vampires, and trying to avoid them until the 30 days are up, rather than trying to take them down.These problems along with a complete lack of logic by the characters sink the film. This is best summed up when about 3/4 of the way into the film, a character leads all the vampires to a house, where he grabs an inspired weapon to use against them. The weapon works beautifully and then he doesn't even try to use it again!!! On top of this, people hide out for days and nobody needs to eat so much as a sandwich. 6 people dash through the streets to another location with one axe between them. Nobody even thinks to grab a plank of wood or even a frying pan? I know horror-film characters make dumb decisions but that's only good when its part of the fun. This film seems all too willing to just throw out consistency and common sense whenever it is mildly convenient or for no reason whatsoever.'30 Days of Night' - Its a Very Long Period. Pun Intended.

Casino Royale," Bond Fans and Bond Critics Rejoice. Your Prayers and Bitchings Have Been Answered.
","Everything you've heard is true. It's the best Bond film in years. They re-invent it. Daniel Craig has the right stuff. It's fun, funny, fresh, exciting, tense, gritty and just a bloody great film.Daniel Craig: My God, James Bond has proved that looks really don't matter. Craig's face, kindly, is rugged; truthfully, is sorta squashed. His ears stick out and more than one person has remarked to me that he looks more like a Bond villain than Bond. Plus he's blonde in real life! But Craig has what it takes. His Bond is masculine, gritty, icy, charming, cool, funny, sexist, sensitive and soulful. What comes through is Craig's strengths as an actor. Whether being tortured, dying or falling for the girl, Craig makes you believe. All those people at Craignotbond are probably a laughing-stock to their friends and family now!This Bond film addresses all of the problems and awkwardness with the previous Bond films. It seems that Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) and others have really taken a hard look at the franchise. Case in point: People wanted the light-hearted sexy fun of the past Bond girl without making her a cliché air-headed victim that needs saving. Consequently, we got a little bit of everything like Denise Richard's nuclear physicist (smart!) in shorts (sexy!) with the name Christmas Jones (playful! / traditional!). It didn't ring true. However the only way to go is with quality. Eva Green is fantastic as Bond's equal - Vesper Lynd. She matches him in every way while retaining a vulnerability that is as human as well as feminine. I think I'm in love. Also, it is worth noting Mads Mikkelsen as villain Le Chiffre, who is a genuine bad ass.What this film does is boldly address the Bond conventions and comes up with the right answers through sheer inventiveness and sly playfulness. They know that by now we are in on the joke and the usual stuff is handled delightfully - ordering the drink, the car, the suit, bedding beautiful women. But it doesn't awkwardly mock or rubbish the conventions while still trying to enjoy them. Instead, it respects them and views them as delights rather than constricting problems that have to be dealt with. It's this sense of fun and opportunity that pervades Casino Royale. Things just flow together so well, I honestly wouldn't mind this film winning some sort of screen writing award.Unlike 99% of the action films out there, the action and fights in this are brutally realistic rather than the rolling around slap and tickle we've come to expect. It really raises the bar. It's grasping, desperate, brutal and shocking as lives are put on the line. I think it was Pierce Brosnan, who said that if you're not getting bruised doing Bond you're not doing it right. He's right, but the fight choreographer, Daniel Craig, and stunt-people have really stepped it up for this film.This film is really a 9.5 stars because of a slightly wandering final 30 minutes or so, but I have to choose between 9 and 10 so - 10. The first majority of the film is an absolute pressure cooker, especially the long poker scenes (it was a brave gamble to play them out for so long).Overall, this really is an A for effort. Those whose motto in life is 'there are no short-cuts to quality' will feel gratified by this film. Instead of fumbling around and hoping for the best, everyone involved in this film has put in so much thought, energy, and devotion, I just feel like hugging them.Men want to be him. Women want to be with him. Ladies and Gentlemen, Bond, James Bond, is back.",10,2,6,16 January 2007
Sin City," 101 Gratuitous Maimings for Dummies
","A comment on violence. I've seen a lot of violence in films. I've never liked gratuitous violence and I've found that as I've gotten older (I'm early 20's) that I like it less and less. People will automatically jump on me for watching and then low-grading this film. They'll tell me that I'm a fool and if I knew anything about the source material and creative team behind the film, then I shouldn't have bothered watching it.It's true that I didn't know anything about the comics, but I've seen Tarantino's films and 'Pulp Fiction' is one of my favourite films. I found it to be the perfect balance between style and substance. However, I did not like his 'Kill Bill' movies as much. Part 1 - too much violence/style and not enough story. Part 2 - too much plot and exposition. With tighter editing he should have turned it into the one film it was meant to be. After all, 'Pulp Fiction' was originally about 550 pages long before he pretty much cut it in half. I blame the Weinsteins ....'Sin City' is just so over-the-top in its blood, guts and gore. An alternative title for the film could be '101 Gratuitous Maimings for Dummies.' The other problem with the film is that it tries so hard to be slick that it is just cheesy. All the hookers in Old Town looked like Models from Lingerie catalogues. Not hot at all because its just so flashy and overstated.The responses to the above complaints will likely be - 'it is not meant to be real, its meant to be cheesy and over-the-top, it's meant to be fantasy, it was made for a specific audience and they loved it, what were you expecting? ' Well just because they meant for it to be like this, it doesn't mean it is enjoyable. Just because they went for corn and cheese does not mean it tastes good. Just because its fantasy doesn't mean it should sacrifice all probability for bullshit. Just because this was made for testosterone-fuelled-youngsters doesn't mean its not a disappointment that the people behind this film are capable of a lot more. I hope 'Grindhouse' is more fun than blood and guts. If not, one day Tarantino's substance and nuance will rise from the ashes.Final point. So why not a 1-star? The acting from the all-star cast is satisfactory, Alexis Bledel is hot (good casting) and it looks good (but my dislike for the film soon soured that).",2,7,15,29 November 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Jokes are Fine, but It Should Have Been More
","Doesn't it suck how so many big event hyped-up movies are labelled with 'it could have been more' these days? But I guess that means when they get it right, its even more special.The one-liners and pranks are fine all the way through. There's nothing cringe-worthy-in-a-bad-way here. You'll chuckle, but something needed to be done to separate this from, and make it much more than, just an extended TV show. This is possibly as hard as it sounds, but I'll tell you what they needed to do. They needed to make the premise much more significant. They main plot needed to be incredibly daring/wacky/outrageous and possibly irreparable. What they chose - government's big dome going over Springfield - was not that interesting and wasn't even milked to enough comic effect. Unlike other major crises on the TV show, this one has the opportunity to stretch out for two hours and reveal deeper and more complex internal conflicts inside the souls of Springfield - to comic effect of course. The other plot threads - Marge and Homer's marriage problems, Bart's Dad problem, Lisa's boyfriend - aren't that bad but you pretty much know how they're going to end up.So what we have left is lots of good one-liners and pranks, and a feeling that it was all over so quickly. The makers really wanted this to be good. They seemed to have wanted it so badly that they were afraid to stick their big toe in too much. It's like a good TV episode, and a kind of missed opportunity.",7,1,2,13 February 2008
