10 Cloverfield Lane," Very close to 10 stars
","Maybe I should give this 10 stars because this movie is very very good.
My only reason for giving it a solid 9 stars is the ending. Without any spoilers its like they left room for a part 2... I dont like that",9,0,0,4 May 2020
No Country for Old Men," One of the best
","This movie is just great!
Did you notice that there is no underlying music in the movie?
Wow this movie is a present! The beginning.... Nobody talks for the first 10-15 minutes or so. Just fantastic acting and camerawork...
I have seen this over and over, and I will continue to do so :)",10,3,3,16 April 2020
Meet Joe Black," Truly great
","Everything is just perfect here...
All actors are performing topdollar.
The story is just amazing, and very interesting.
There is so much tension between Brad and Claire, that your screen is soaked :-)
You can feel (and see) that everyone had a party making this movie.",10,0,0,27 April 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Great story
","The aftermath of a gone-wrong robbery. We get to know the background story leading up to the robbery. Every person involved we get to know very well.
There is some really good actors here. And they all give their best.",9,0,0,5 April 2020
Pulp Fiction," A must see
","If you have just the slightest possible interest in movies, you already saw this one.
If not.... Then .u.. yourself!
You simply dont deserve life if you didnt see this one.",10,1,3,5 April 2020
In Time," Extremely interesting
","The person who got the idea for this story should have an Oscar.
This movie is very very very good... I mean very good!
The story is so fascinating, and it makes you think even days after watching it.",9,0,1,27 April 2020
The Untouchables," Some of the best actors makes this movie
","The casting is great, and even that its made in 1987 it still holds water.
If you like gangster movies I am sute you will like this one.
Personal I dont care much about the law in this movie. But there is plenty of gangster scenes to make it up for that :-)",9,0,0,22 May 2020
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Near perfect
","Its near perfect without I can tell excactly what could make it perfect.
Its inspired by the book, and maybe thats what only makes it nearly perfect.
Even that it is not 100% true to the book, they follow the book to a point where its to close. In a way that there is no new thoughts to the idea.
I like Draculas true servant :D He is hilarous.
The first hour Draculas movements is full of suspence, but then its like running out in the sand the last hour.
And this Van Helsing s..t! Make a movie without that please... Like 'Interview with the vampire'
We dont need any 'good ones'
We like Dracula..... He is no more evil than a tiger hunting for food.",9,0,0,27 April 2020
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Recommended!
","This is a must-see if you have the slightest interest in vampire movies.
The story is very interesting, but of course not as detailed like the books.
But you should not compare. Just enjoy this wonderfull story which developes over hundreds of years...
Imagine eternal life....",10,0,0,27 April 2020
True Romance," Tarantino!
","I love this movie. I think I have seen it close to 100 times during the years.
Great actors, and typical Tarantino scenes. And the story is just great. It has action, thrills, and some extremely funny scenes. It is also very much a romantic movie.
Find your beloved one and take a deep seat in the couch and watch this one ;)",10,1,1,5 April 2020
