Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The 'Pirates' sagas get better
","I've read some comments that didn't think this as good as the earlier 'Pirates'...not true. Great action and comedy, and fantastic acting. So many great actors in supporting/cameo roles in this film. No spoilers. Well written with great inside jokes (if you pay attention). I like that the Captain Jack Sparrow character is being given more background. Before he was quirky and likable but only seemed to be acting as a catalyst in the Swan/Turner love story. Now he has his own back story and possible love 'stirrings'. Penelope Cruz does a great job as the female foil in this one. She had a hard role balancing her character between the pull of bad vs good. Ian McShane was a fantastic choice for the part of Blackbeard! Geoffrey Rush - his Barbosa is iconic. Really liked the mermaids! This was one of the better 'Pirate' films, in my opinion. This film is more balanced and not as dark as the 2nd and 3rd were. Loved the ending, which made sense (if you know your history). This is a truly fun and intelligent pirate movie. I gave a 9 because I would have liked to see more development of the Judy D. and Johnny D. coach scene. She's such a great actress. I hope the 'Pirates' sagas continue.",Null,0,1,29 October 2011
