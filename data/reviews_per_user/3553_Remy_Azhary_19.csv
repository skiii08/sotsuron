Men in Black 3," Lackluster overall but with quite an original ending
","The whole 'time-travel' thing did not really work for me. I mean one must tread ever so lightly and delicately with great care when putting premises of time-travel on screen. The idea itself may sound interesting but it may not probably be a good idea even if you're a pure science-fiction purist or in the written words. For the H.G. Wells' classic novel, maybe but it did not even work well for its screen version of the 2002 Guy Pearce's THE TIME MACHINE. And it definitely did not work well for this one either. Thus, I was right to be skeptical about having time-travel plot in this movie. See the danger lies of the whole time-travel thing to be both tacky and cheesy if it was not done tastefully and it shows in MIB³. Though I must admit that this is after all a movie with great emphasis on visual effects and they were no doubt pleasing to the eyes; the storyline, on the other hand, was not quite as impressive as the first two films.This one appeared to display that lackluster performance on screen especially with the absence of Rip Torn as 'Agent Zed'. Perhaps, this is one of the aspects that MIB³ did not 'feel' like MEN IN BLACK at all. And it was that conspicuous.I was also hoping that with Emma Thompson's appearance in this version would add that certain freshness to the film particularly a bigger credit to her range of roles where Thompson was usually typecast as playing a lady of prim and proper mannerisms in period dramas. Yet it did not happen for this third installment. Her on screen time was too brief and it seemed to be a little 'off' for a female agent with a British accent in this supposedly a film about an American governmental organization. Moreover, there was almost no further development in terms of the romantic chemistry between her character and that of Tommy Lee Jones' 'Agent K' whom the former played Jones' love interest as told in the 1960s part of the movie as opposed to the rigid boss of the present day. Strangely though, I do appreciate her hairdo in this movie. It was sophisticated and good enough for a female corporate leader.As seen in earlier MIB films, there were scenes of cameos appearing in the movies like the late Michael Jackson (or perhaps his double) in MEN IN BLACK 2. This one is no less impressive with the voluptuous and buxom lead vocalist of the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole Scherzinger, at the start to whet any guy's appetite for the film; and trust me, she was hot as hell. There was also moments where you could see Lady Gaga appearing on an overhead monitor in the MIB Headquarters; and if you're attentive enough you would be able to spot a moment of renowned director Tim Burton (whose dull DARK SHADOWS certainly bore me to tears).All in all, although MEN IN BLACK 3 was so much better than the dull DARK SHADOWS it somehow felt nothing special to me.But credit has to be given for ending of the film, which was probably the most original part of the movie, as the real relationship between Will Smith's 'Agent J' and Tommy Lee Jones' 'Agent K' was revealed and it came full circle as to link their true relationship.Whatever it is if you have some money to spare and are dying to see MEN IN BLACK 3, see it for the blockbuster aspect of it. Other than that, do not expect much.",6,6,14,24 May 2012
A Star Is Born," Impressive all around
","Wow! To say the least, A STAR IS BORN truly lives up to its hype and deserving of its rave reviews that had people talking.Bradley Cooper, in his first directorial debut, really directed the heck out of the movie and the film turned out to be pretty impressive for the actor-turned-director.Every aspect of the movie was given meticulous details and no stone was left unturned in making sure that movie was made really well.As for the performances, I was truly blown away by Cooper, of course. Taking three roles in the making of the movie (as actor, producer and director), Cooper add an extensive part in his acting role, that is as a singer. Although I'm not surprised that he could sing and play music (specifically playing the guitar), doing all those jobs was by no means an easy feat to pull off but he did all of them that ought to deserve the Academy's attention and recognition. Otherwise, the Academy is truly blind.And even more impressive was on the part of Lady Gaga. Even though this was not her first acting gig as she had made quite impressive performance in the TV series, American Horror Story. But Lady Gaga truly shone her acting chops in a leading role that demanded a lot from her.Lady Gaga stripped away her renowned celebrity status to showcase a vulnerable yet powerful role that demanded of her.All in all, I could confidently say that this new rendition of A STAR IS BORN could easily be up for Oscar consideration in the following categories:Best Motion Picture
Best in Directing - Bradley Cooper
Best Actor - Bradley Cooper
Best Actress - Lady Gaga
Best Supporting Actor - Sam Elliot
Best Cinematography
Best Editing
Best Original Song - 'I'll Never Love Again' AND/OR 'Shallow'In any case, it is undoubtedly that A STAR IS BORN is sure to win Best Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical) at the Golden Globes. I can guarantee on it.",10,21,50,5 October 2018
Argo," A reminiscence of WAG THE DOG and APOLLO 13 with Oscars reeking all around it
","Although heightened up for dramatic purposes, ARGO proved to be an intense thriller. Even with numerous inaccuracies portrayed in the film it never once strayed far from its clever storytelling techniques.Right from its opening sequence when the Time-Warner logo appeared on screen to its entire atmosphere of the film truly felt like it was a movie conceived back in the 70-80s era. Though not grainy or scratchy as one would imagine seeing an actual film from those decades director, Ben Affleck, cleverly brought the essence of the Iran Hostage Crisis of the late 70s as surreal as possible like we're watching an actual footage or documentary on film.I highly appreciate the intensity that Affleck brought to the story and his brilliant vision of this true event to contemporary audience who may or may not aware of the real story.Nevertheless, Affleck managed to capture not only the 'feel' of the 70s but also the dramatic chronology of the events.Personally, I am aware of the Iran Hostage Crisis however I must admit that I had no prior knowledge that the whole rescue operation by CIA was made into a somewhat close resemblance to the 1997 film WAG THE DOG; in that the US government had some sort of collaboration with Hollywood studios to make up stories as a decoy for an actual political agenda.But needless to say Affleck did an excellent job in dramatizing the event.I would sum up ARGO as an intense rescue mission that has a more edge-of-your-seat moments a la 1995 APOLLO 13. However, ARGO brings the audience to a whole lots of intensity that I was practically tossing and turning in my seat in suspense.As such, with its surreal editing and great script coupled with brilliant acting and direction by Ben Affleck there is no doubt that ARGO indeed reeks of Oscars all around.",Null,2,4,19 November 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Superb concluding chapter to a a brilliant series
","I had the chance of watching THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM yesterday and I must say that I was really impressed with the amount of energy-pumping action that went out throughout the entire film. Never was there any dull moment in the film.The pacing was just right in that it was really quick (but not too quick) so much so that it did not quite feel like it was an almost 2-hour movie. The adrenalin rush was enough to keep the audience at the edge of their seats.Equipped with brilliant dialogues, scheming political conspiracies and lots and lots of governmental jargons, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is one film that qualifies as a truly action-packed concluding chapter in the Robert Ludlum's Bourne trilogy. In fact, the Bourne series itself should be considered as the longest action-thriller movie if all the films were put together.To wrap the film, the end credits rolled with the trademark Bourne song EXTREME WAYS by Moby.However, I was left rather unsatisfied at the end of the movie for the fate of Jason Bourne (or his true name, which I would not reveal). Although it is the concluding chapter to the Bourne series, I somehow felt as if the ending forces me to think that there is a need for a continuation.Nonetheless, it was a superb film.",10,2,5,13 August 2007
The Aviator," Doesn't feel the 'Scorsese' factor but loving it!
","Before I went to catch this movie, I had my reservations about it. Knowing that it was directed by Scorsese and most of his films are rather artistic. I mean the camera angles, the scenes transitions and things like that.I was totally bored to sleep when I saw GANGS OF NEW YORK...I actually dozed off a few times in the theater and was thinking to myself when it is dragshow ever gonna finish.But I was pretty satisfied (thought not completely cos it's still is Scorsese...gawd, I feel as if I'm biased against him). Anyway, this film is a pretty good biopic. Have heard but not know anything about Howard Hughes and certainly it does have the Oscars and Golden Globe rings to it.Well, all in all, THE AVIATOR is a good film though.",Null,0,1,8 January 2005
"I, Robot"," MINORITY REPORT meets TERMINATOR
","I agree with what some of the people wrote about this movie. Indeed, as my subject stated it this film does have the essence of both movies. In that, both MINORITY REPORT and I, ROBOT are sci-fi flicks no doubt however they have good and solid story lines. Not just those 'cliched' sci-fi movies where the only main thing is the special effects. And no doubt, being a sci-fi flick both MINORITY REPORT and I, ROBOT have got to include the inevitable existence of the special effects factors however what made these two films good and have in common are the non-accidental story lines to portray the realism of the main drama. As a matter of fact, the effects are only secondary. And being a 'robot' movie, this film still maintained the actions of a futuristic sci-fi flick, just as the TERMINATOR movies are.Hence, what impressed me about I, ROBOT was the effective dramatization of the futuristic world.",Null,0,0,21 July 2004
Now You See Me," A complex brain twister that is fun, brilliant and stylish
","WOW!!!That's exactly how I feel about NOW YOU SEE ME. Frankly, I don't see why many dissed the film. Perhaps, because this one constantly urged them to actually use almost 90% percent of your brain to decode the tricks in the entire movie from start to end.No doubt the movie is a mixture of numerous tricks ranging from optics to numbers to common logic. And there were also some that still remained to be explained; supernatural maybe. Nevertheless, the movie was both totally mind-blowing and mind-boggling.To be honest, I'm not all too crazy with Louis Leterrier as the director. I mean his take on the 2010 remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS was quite a disappointment.However, the ensemble cast was amazing, cool and slick; just as I had expected them to be. But the intricacies of panning out the plot was a complex one. So much so that there was an essence of solving a mystery a la the Nicholas Cage's film, NATIONAL TREASURE. There was also that essence of Dan Brown's 'Robert Langdon' style which we saw in THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS.However, the more intriguing charm about NOW YOU SEE ME is that it actually compels the audience to think as to how the 'magicians' were able to literally trick the audience. In other words, it's like watching that TV show, 'Secrets of Magicians Revealed' with Morgan Freeman played its TV-equivalent of Mitch Pileggi who revealed how each of the tricks were pulled off.No doubt there is a twist to this one and you would constantly try to figure out who was behind the whole grand plan. At times, I was convinced that it was Freeman himself but he was none other than a red herring.I mean the plot got so twisted that I simply gave up and chose to sit through the movie as the end revealed the real mastermind. In actual fact, this person was right under our very nose that we didn't see it coming.I'd see it again.",Null,7,12,6 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Great epic rendition to a standalone children's fantasy...and then some!
","Peter Jackson did a brilliant job in taking liberal creative license in bringing out the epic feel of this continuation from a rather innocent book meant for children. This installment is very much different from the first film not just of its epic scale but particularly Jackson's input to incorporate darker themes with more adult-oriented storyline which includes romantic plots.Right from the beginning I felt that there was some sort of a disconnection or that certain lacking of association from the first film even though this one is a continuation from of the first.For those who have actually read the book you would have known that one significant addition to this film was the inclusive of the female elf, Tauriel, and her lingering romance with Legolas of whom the latter was not even written in the book.To make things even more complicated or rather to have that somewhat tasteful twist to it, Jackson even had Tauriel to be emotionally attached to one of the dwarfs, Kili, that in my opinion was the hottest one of all and did not look anything like a dwarf.But I appreciate Jackson's approach to bring Tolkien's beloved children's book in another direction.If THE HOBBIT book could be regarded as a standalone fiction on itself then I'm I'm glad that Jackson and his co-writers, Phillipa Boyens and and Fran Walsh, actually took the painstaking effort to link THE HOBBIT films to THE LORD OF THE RINGS especially with familiar characters of Sauron, Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond.As the title suggests, the film obviously reveals to us the dragon Smaug in all of his glory. And all I can say is that the fire-drake's appearance was simply breathtaking. That was how a dragon is suppose to look like. Somehow, I can't help but to make a comparison between this dragon Smaug to that of the one in Dennis Quaid's DRAGONHEART especially with the authoritative vocalizations provided Benedict Cumberbatch that sounded eerily similar to Sean Connery's vocal portrayal. Nevertheless, I'm impressed by Smaug's presence.**SPOILER**However, I do have to say that ending was not what I'd expected at all even though I am fully aware that there would be a concluding episode to the whole HOBBIT franchise coming out next year. And that is the film's super abrupt cliffhanger. As you could imagine from Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy the ending of the first two films had their share of cliffhangers of their own. Yet in THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the ending was so abrupt that it practically choked many of the audience in the theater. It was that abrupt as if Jackson himself had no idea of how to end the film subtly like THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING or THE TWO TOWERS or other films for that matter.But needless to say, I am pretty pleased by the outcome of THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.",10,4,16,12 December 2013
Meet the Fockers," Gawd, it's too much to handle
","Gawd, how do I start....OK, dun get me wrong...I mean this movie is one hilarious flick. Comedy couldn't get much better than this. This comedy is truly a comedy in every sense of the word. I mean in my summary above refers to the amount of humor that are being slotted in a single scene. Too much for me handle...even too much for my stomach to handle my laughter. I've got few people in the theater laughing their hearts out that coughs followed afterwards and many other had tears running down due to too much giggling.And of course there were lots of claps here and there. Surprisingly, there was an applause at the end of the movie.I know my comments might seem overly hysterical but my friends and I thought of seeing it again.It's a great flick to catch but a warning though. It's a highly sexually-charged movie so might be a taboo for some. But at least it's classier than the SCARY MOVIE series.",10,1,4,31 December 2004
Call Me by Your Name," Visual Poetry of the Emotions
","Watching the movie in its entirety from beginning to end (and yes, even till the end credits rolled to black) felt like having an arrow shot right through to your heart and it got yanked out with a sudden force that it hurt so much.And the pain from that bleeding heart was the emotional pain I feel when you lose someone.As melodramatic as it sounds, that's how heartbreaking the movie felt.Yes, we've seen plenty of other love stories been told on films. Let alone one that is of LGBT-themed. But the thing is unlike many other LGBT-themed films that usually independently-made this one got mainstream attention.And I'm glad it did, especially having read the book years ago. So knowing that it's getting a screen adaptation I was naturally ecstatic.And it could very well be the best LGBT film I'd seen so far.As genre-centric as it is, the pair of lovers could simply be interchangeable with hetero couples or anyone with a heart.In essence, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a human story that is multi-layered. As for the tempo of the film, no doubt it was a slow burn but the emotional payoff at the end of the movie was worth it. In a sense that, we feel the heartbreak that Elio felt. Not to mention, those scenes served the story in the bigger aspect of the movie.As strange as it sounds, it weirdly felt good to be torn apart emotionally in such a way. Perhaps, as human beings, we yearn for some affection some way or another. And thus, deep in our hearts we can relate to the emotions of the characters whether we choose to be opened or discreetly be quiet about it.And granted that, both Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer (even Michael Stuhlbarg) were playing their respective roles, yet the impacts from the characters they played left a deep impression on myself having seen how they evolved through the film.To quote a reviewer, he described the film as a visual poetry. I couldn't agree with him more. This is one piece of art for the ages.",10,3,9,28 December 2017
Evil Dead," The irony lies in its production budget
","Just as I'd expected EVIL DEAD turned out to be just another typical remake of today. Seriously, Hollywood needs to learn its lesson of not cashing in from originals. I was gingerly anticipating to see this new 'reboot', if you will, as I knew remakes don't usually make it good on the screen these days. And people these days are far more preoccupied with their mobile devices to be even remotely interested in watching movies anymore.That said, on with my thoughts about how the new EVIL DEAD was. For a start, I'm not making any comparisons to the original 1981 Sam Raimi's version. Although the effects and makeup in that latter version were filthy cheap, not to mention extremely cheesy by today's standards, somehow 1981 EVIL DEAD gave a far more superior spooky atmosphere than this latest one.In the original EVIL DEAD, the audience are treated immediately with an aura of evil as soon as the film started. There was no studio logo introduction. We started off with evil's POV running through the woods as if sensing its victims.The 2013 one, however, wasted the audience's time by attempting to build a story around it and that tremendously slows down the pacing which I could certainly feel.However, credits still have to be given to the effort of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell (the director and protagonist of the original film) in that I could see remnants of their 1981 film in this one. One of these includes the pendant that the protagonists in both versions gave to their lover (1981) and sister (2013).I wouldn't go any further in elaborating how much I prefer the original version than this new one. But sufficed to say that this 2013 relied too much on its goriest and gruesome tortures. Even the 'possessions' looked cheap. The irony is that the so-called 'makeups' looked far cheaper than the cheap 1981 version, if that makes any sense at all.To be honest, I was sitting in the theater constantly thinking how many of these (pardon my tone) idiots ever saw the original.In short, I'd say this 2013 EVIL DEAD looked like the gorefests of the SAW franchise and 1972 THE EXORCIST (times 5) with the makeup effects of Hollywood's THE RING.To quote Sidney Prescott from SCREAM 4, 'Don't f**k with the original'. Giving a vote of 3 out of 10 is as generous as I could get.",3,13,23,9 May 2013
Clash of the Titans," Bomb of a nuclear proportion
","Never have I had the urge to leave a theater before a movie ends so much till this piece of junk was rolled in front of me. That was exactly how I feel during the running of the latest remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS. If it were not for my friend whose eyes were zealously piercing through those 3D glasses onto the screen, I would have been long gone even before 30 minutes into the movie. Yeah, it was THAT BAD. Throughout the entire movie one quote kept on running in my mind:'WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!'I am usually skeptical about watching remakes especially after the numerous spawning of such mediocre productions over the past decade or so. Yet when I read news that there would be an update version to the 1981 CLASH OF THE TITANS, I was conflicted with both enthusiasm and skepticism. For one thing, I have such reverence for the original version in terms of its faithful storyline in accordance to the legends and its authentic Greek feel. On the other hand, I felt that there was also a need to update the effects via new technologies; which I initially admit that the Ray Harryhausen's stop-animation masterpieces were pretty tacky and cheesy.I was hoping for too much.The result is a total waste of time for the audience and waste of talents in the lights of the actors, even for the gifted director, Louis Leterrier (who previously directed THE INCREDIBLE HULK which was good).The 2010 version of CLASH does not live up to its predecessor on so many levels. In fact, personally, I feel that it's really a bomb of a nuclear proportion.For a start, it felt too rushed as if trying to feed the audience with too many food from the buffet table all at one go so much so that as an audience I felt lost for most of the time. There were also too many unnecessary characters that not only disrupt the plot but were extremely annoying as well. Another point was that, some of these characters had almost no background stories at all. It's as if the writers felt compelled to showcase their existence in the film just so they could tie in to the mythology without having any need to have a proper introduction. For instance, Pegasus suddenly appeared all of a sudden without informing the audience where this creature came from leaving some of those (ahem...ignoramus who have no idea about Greek mythologies) audience clueless.The appearance of cameos were equally wasted on their roles that came on screen only for a few minutes. Screen veterans such as Pete Postlethwaite, Polly Walker, Jane March and Danny Houston were on screen for a mere several minutes with some of them only uttering a single line. Mind you, these are good Hollywood actors whose time were much deserved on better film projects.And just because the buzz word in films these days is 3D, that does not necessarily translate as making this 'supposedly blockbuster' crap into one as well. Plus, it's tiring to have those glasses clutching onto your head throughout the entire movie especially when the only prominent 3D effect that was visible on screen was the subtitles.Now, having seen the new CLASH, I somehow have grown an immense respect for the 1981 version. I felt that those tacky and cheesy effects in the original 1981 version were but minute and trivial altogether in comparison to its bigger picture of the movie itself. I somehow feel humbled by the learned writings of Beverley Cross who designed the story almost accurately to the real legend and the gifted Desmond Davis' vision of the original for their masterpiece deserves all the respect of movie audiences who heard about CLASH OF THE TITANS both old and new. Last but not least, to the 'tacky and cheesy' stop-animations of Ray Harryhausen who does deserve a considerable amount of credit for his effort in bringing the legend of Perseus to life.",1,14,27,2 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A whiny teenage soap opera at best!
","Epic? Really? The only thing that's epic would have to be the hype surrounding this concluding installment.BREAKING DAWN, PART 2 seems to have that lackluster quality about it. The first part of last year's BREAKING DAWN had me growing with intense anticipation of how the entire Twilight saga was going to end. So much so that I loved the second time I went to see it.PART 2 seems to be lacking in so many areas that it almost looked like a whiny teenage soap opera. And I'm not kidding about it. Like those cheesy television dramas I was practically distracted by the good-looking model-like vampires that the movie felt like it's a montage of moving advertisements from Zara or Bershka or Mango. Even the Amazonian vampires looked more like models for Benetton or something. As I saw the trailer I was intrigued by how the author Stephanie Meyer might include exotic vampires and from all walks of life at that. From Irish to even Japanese vampire? Come on! But in the end, the funny thing was that after all those search for vampires all over the world, only few appeared to face up to the army of Volturi's almost 10 times their number. It seems like Meyer might have dreamed this last book of hers right after watching (or reading) Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. And even the 'rock-star' vampire, Garrett, appeared to be like Anne Rice's Lestat. But at least, he had more charms than those Pattinson-Lautner combo put together.As for Mackenzie Foy's Renesmee, she looked more like some CGI-kid developed out of Lucas Studios or something. Even in her infant stage, the baby looked pretty odd. I know this is a make-believe movie but seriously, it's pretty ridiculous.However, I'm particularly drawn to how hot one of the cast was. And it was not the overrated hunky Taylor Lautner. Believe me. With how superficial Hollywood made their actors to be, Lautner's time is so over already. But I'm actually referring Rami Malek who played the Egyptian vampire whose name, 'Benjamin', was peculiarly English instead of a Middle-eastern one. I remembered seeing him once as an Egyptian mummy in Ben Stiller's NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM where he played 'Ahkmenrah'. And he's simply cute.Nevertheless, what it lacked in the epic quality of it PART 2 compensated with the battle scenes between the Volturi's and the rest of vampire and werewolves clans. But even that was just some psychic vision of Alice. The audience were made to believe that it really did happened but only to find out that that was what going to happen should the Volturi's decided on waging the war against the rest of the vampires. Bummer!I'd say that the redeeming part throughout the entire film there were but only two scenes that I found to be rather interestingly engaging.One was when Jacob literally stripped down in front of Bella's father right down to his undies and yikes! HOTNESS! From the moment Lautner flashed out his six-packs from under his shirt I was gawking like a silly schoolgirl and wishing for the two men, Jacob and Bella's father, to get it going on. Yeah, I know I said Taylor Lautner is overrated earlier but, really. Who could resists man's flesh! Even though he's a decade younger than me. YUMMY!!!And yeah, I know. I'm a perv with 'pedophiliac cougar' written all over me. But hey, anyone who sees that scene would be affected one way or anotherunless you're some celibate Benedictine monks; of whom I greatly believe that even they commit sins behind closed doors.Nonetheless, that scene keeps on playing in my mind like I'm wishing to have some alternative cross-generational 'thing' to happen.The second was not even a scene, per se. It's the closing credit that featured the cast from this film and all other earlier Twilight films like Anna Kendrick and the two girls who played Victoria in the earlier films. I must say that I was glad for Kendrick for not being in this one. Perhaps, she realized that she had outgrown this teenage flick as she went to more serious stuff and garnered herself an Oscar nomination for her work in George Clooney's UP IN THE AIR. Even Rachelle Lefevre who played the first Victoria was wise enough to pass on to Bryce Dallas Howard. Perhaps, she might think that these Twilight movies might be some sort of career jinx for her. I mean look at the typecasts given to the trio of Rob Pattinson, Kristen Steward and Taylor Lautner.Anyway, juxtaposed with a sombre tune the closing credits felt as if the filmmakers were compelled to make the audience leaving the theater to have that 'separation anxiety' as if we've grown together with the Twilight saga altogether. Yeah, right!The thing is if it only not for hype and publicity around BREAKING DAWN, PART 2, I would rather spend my money on either PITCH PERFECT or ARGO.",3,9,23,21 November 2012
Sinister," Now here's a horror movie
","This one scared the hell out of me. With the eerie music to accompany the film it sure made the movie creepy as hell. The opening sequence felt so real that it got me hooked to know just what the hell is going on.I was watching it alone on Friday night after work and sure enough there were about less than 10 people in the theater (all of whom were couples). I could bet with my bottom dollar that with this movie they'd be so engaged in the film that they wouldn't dare to think about making out.It is THAT SCARY!!!The film was directed by Scott Derrickson, the same guy who made THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE; and he collaborated with the composer, Christopher Young, on that very film. I am quite familiar with Young's music score from his composition for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 and it was creepy; also he did the score for Sigourney Weaver's serial killer film, COPYCAT.I'm telling you if those two managed to bring out the spine-chilling factor in EMILY ROSE, in SINISTER they really sealed the deal in being the potent filmmakers in the exploration into the paranormal and supernatural. It gave me goosebumps just thinking about it.One thing that I feel about SINISTER was that Derrickson (together with Young) brought us back to that atmospheric terror of the unknown that is truly nostalgic of horror films of the 70s.The feel of the movie was so scary that this was how THE AMITYVILLE HORROR should have been remade.In short, I'd highly recommend you (or better still DARE YOU) to see SINISTER. This is one good date movie if you want your date to crawl under your shirt; or just bring some best buddies to scare the crap out of you. I mean it may not be INSIDIOUS, nevertheless, if you love that then you'll love this.",10,149,253,12 October 2012
The Da Vinci Code," Brown must have been quietly disappointed!
","I take my words back regarding my anticipation of wanting to see this movie. Just saw it today and there was a huge number of changes from the book. Can't say I wanna complain about the changes made but it's more of the continuity of the storyline.For those who read the book, you might feel like the story was a bit 'rushed' that Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman tried to make a movie that practically stuffed the whole of the Dan Brown's book into a 2½ hour movie.There were some parts that I felt that the film was a bit too draggy. But not as draggy or dry as the book. At least once you've done reading the 'drier' part of the book, you'll be indulging in a refreshing treat of maybe a hint of clues to make you think. But the film version didn't really do that.Plus, there are too many flashbacks into history. TRUE, while these flashbacks are critical in telling the story but they were rather too messed up.***** SPOILERS STARTS HERE*****Among the changes made were: 1 - Langdon was summoned at a book signing instead of from his hotel as written in the book; 2 - There was only one clue from the cryptex when there were in fact two as from the book; that is the first answer to the cryptex (SOFIA) was deleted; 3 - The identity of the 'TEACHER' was revealed too soon.; Another point to take note was that Teabing's manservant, Remy, suddenly died without giving the audience any clue what he died from.4 - The HIEROS GAMUS ritual was (I believe) almost deleted due to its sexual nature.5 - As compared to the book, Sophie was reunited only with her grandmother but her brother was nowhere around; the young church caretaker might as well be her brother but even that info was not revealed.***** SPOILERS ENDS HERE*****I'm not suggesting that you totally ignore this film completely. By all means, go see it since it's a 'much anticipated movie' of the year. This is only my personal opinion. Who knows maybe you might like it even more.",Null,0,4,18 May 2006
Joker," A perfect companion movie or a prequel of some sort to Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'
","I was blown away by this film.Joaquin Phoenix delivered a sure-win Oscar performance as the Joker. And I can straight-out say that this was a perfect companion movie or a prequel of some sort to Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.It was in the final act of the movie that I literally saw Phoenix's performance as if the late Heath Ledger himself was reprising his role as the titular character. Phoenix seamlessly slipped into the characterisation of the Joker as Ledger did. From the character's mannerisms to the words that he uttered. It was like the Joker was an entity in itself - a real thing/person that owns any actors playing the role.But that's not to say that I purposefully distinguished both actors during the movie. Nor was the fact that Phoenix made it a point to replicate what was already did by Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. Both actors owned the character in their own ways. But it's like they both captured the essence of The Joker as he was intended to be in the comics.Another thing was that critics have been saying that Todd Philips' 'Joker' was very Scorsese-esque with regards to the latter's 'Taxi Driver' and 'The Kings of Comedy'. And I could see why. But in my own words, I would say that 'Joker' was more of a homage to those two rather than trying to emulate Scorsese's works. From the 70s New York-style of Gotham to the colour palate used in the cinematography, everything just screamed from that era. Even the haunting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir was so disturbing that it drew me ever deeper into the movie.When it comes to 'Taxi Driver' it was no denying that there were parallelisms between that and 'Joker'. Yet, I think 'Joker' compels us to re-analyse the message that is still relevant to these troubled times just as Scorsese did for 'Taxi Driver' during the 70s.I would say 'Joker' is a multi-layered movie that played on so many aspects of society and its impacts on individuals. Such as the treatment of society on mental illness and depression as well as the possible outcomes of such environmental abuse that cause the degradation of individuals that burned that need to act on their violent tendencies onto society as a payback. These facts, as portrayed in the 'Joker', are all grounded in our reality; with gun violence, murders, etc.As such, 'Joker' (along with Alfred Hitchcock's tour de force, 'Psycho') ought to be a visual medium as a curricular training tool in psychological studies not just for students but also to be indoctrinated in law enforcement organisations' training modules.With that said, 'Joker' is by no means a cautionary tale of societal impact on one's behavioural mould.In terms of pacing, the movie was, no doubt, a slow burn and audiences seeking action sequences would utterly be disappointed even though The Joker was synonymous with the Batman series and the DC universe. However, that's not to say that there were no hints in relation to Bruce Wayne. But keep in mind, with a title like 'Joker' this movie is rightfully deserved to be told from the perspective of the titular protagonist (or antagonist, whichever you look at it).But, for me, it was surprisingly fine with it. It takes its time to properly address its message. As for the depictions of violence in the movie, there were indeed intense and gory. So much so that at times, I found myself looking away or holding on tight my to my seat. But they were justified to tell the story otherwise the movie would just fall flat. However, that's not to say that I condone those violent acts nor I expect 'some kind of action' going.Nevertheless, 'Joker' was indeed a masterpiece that captured the timeless issue of violence and societal impacts on individuals.",10,1,3,3 October 2019
Dark Shadows," Utterly disappointing
","From the trailer, I was expecting Tim Burton to re-conjure up his clever supernatural formula of his 1988's BEETLEJUICE. I knew that he was going to take a comedic direction as compared to the serious Gothic thriller versions of the 60s and 90s TV series . However, Burton failed to make this one work, much less a big screen version to the successful series. In fact, I would be so generous as to say that the trailer makes better sales pitch than the movie itself.But apparently I was sheep enough to be deceived by its sly marketing.Ghosts, witches, vampires and werewolves would certainly make good concoctions for an interesting supernatural movie premise after the recent splash of the superhero ensemble that was THE AVENGERS. But it seems that that was pure wishful thinking. I was bored to my bones and uninterested throughout the entire movie. I found myself practically praying when the movie is going to end as my focus was beginning to drain out.On another level, it's quite plain to see that the Burton-Depp collaboration has been definitely been exhausted. I mean I should have seen the tell-tale signs that their so-called 'professional marriage made in cinema heaven' had faded when they did the trying-too-hard screen version of the musical SWEENEY TODD. It seems like their last best project together would have to be SLEEPY HOLLOW and whatever they do afterwards seems to be forced. It's as if Hollywood itself is the mastermind that makes them keep up with the charades.Strangely enough, it was Depp himself who jokingly hinted on E! that his collaboration with Burton seems to be failing like many Hollywood marital affairs. And it was proved a true revelation in this latest box-office bomb (to me, at least).Like many others who flocked early to get the tickets, I was really anticipating a fun journey. Instead, all we got was an arid unimpressive trip into oblivion. I suppose those who among the lucky ones to have snapped up tickets to sold-out shows really deserved the junk that we saw on screen.As colourful as the poster might have looked the only vibrance about DARK SHADOWS were the 70s costumes and Helena Bonham Carter's rich makeup. Even those did not feel authentic to the era other than tunes by The Carpenters.I must say that it was a terrible waste of talents to be in this excuse of a 'dark comedy'. From Michelle Pfeiffer to the gorgeous Eva Green and cameos by Christopher Lee and the original 'Barnabas Collins', Jonathan Frid (who passed on following the wrap-up). At the risk of sounding cruel I suppose his demise was probably due his disappointment Burton's treatment to his original series. And even Alice Cooper's presence did not particularly grace the film with his homage to the age of rock-and-rock of the 70s.",2,50,102,11 May 2012
Prometheus," Definitely a prequel...and then some!
","PROMETHEUS is a unique film in that it's a mishmash of all those space adventure movies that we've seen so far...and then some!Its opening sequence felt pretty much like Stanley Kubrick's '2001' where it all began with man's discovery of the beginning of life and his inquisitive drive to find out the real truth. But instead of drawing a metaphoric picture of primates evolving into more sophisticated creatures as theorized by Charles Darwin we were spared from those dry images of the Kubrick's iconic film.However, there's that unmistakable similarities from the 1968 film in which a single character was then introduced in an isolated environment of a spaceship in the distant universe.Then as more characters are being introduced I couldn't help but feel like there was also an essence of the 1997 intergalactic horror, EVENT HORIZON, in which we certainly feel like we're totally alone in deep space and that something fatal was about to happen.No doubt that there had been speculations and even rumors that this film is a prequel to Scott's 1978 ALIEN or that it reflected that film. Even I refused to think this was so given the fact that otherwise it defeats the purpose of Scott even considering making this film to mimic his original masterpiece. But indulge me for a little.But the truth of the matter is it did reflect Scott's original ALIEN and there was that predictability of what's going to happen next in each scene.And like I said earlier about this film being a mishmash of other space (or rather, alien) movies, towards the end it felt so much like the suicidal version of Will Smith's 1996 INDEPENDENCE DAY.But here's the real kicker, the ending was somewhat a giveaway to all those speculations and rumors that we're forced to face with. Let's just say that the predictability of it (for those familiar with Scott's ALIEN) explained a lot to why most people would say that PROMETHEUS was a prequel to ALIEN.As for the characters there was not much of development in them except that we would see striking similarities to ALIEN. Another thing was that it was strange to see how the coldness in Charlize Theron's portrayal of the evil queen in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN sort of rubbed off in her stiff and rigid role in this one.Nevertheless, there was no short of suspense in PROMETHEUS and the visual effects were equally spectacular to reflect the futuristic image of space.",8,3,7,6 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A definite epic with unexpected twists yet 'philosophical' in nature.
","THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is definitely epic in scale and its storyline was nothing short of chaotic as the antagonists wreaked havoc on Gotham City. Yet somehow, this one is slightly different from the second film in that it takes a 'philosophical' stand on Batman's back story in which it is almost similar to the first one. We also get to know the history of Bane and here is where the interesting twist begins to unveil as we're shown how his past life intermingled with that of Batman's.This year seems like movies are coming full circle in terms of their characters. For example, in MEN IN BLACK III we were given retrospective stories behind the true relationship between Agent K and Agent J. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES also gave the same effect of giving the audience a link between Batman's past and his present.The female roles in this one are equally compelling as well. They're not about to become the damsels in distress. I believe this is part of Christopher Nolan's charm as a director and co- writer in which he gave great empowerments to his female characters whereby they feature strong roles in his past films. Even in the last THE DARK KNIGHT, the character of Rachel Dawes (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) displayed strong appeal to the audience as she was not about to take crap from anyone even in her most vulnerable scenes as Heath Ledger's The Joker confronted her in the Bruce Wayne's benefit party scene and as a kidnapped victim. In THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, Nolan's female characters are again given strong roles and empowerments as they were not to be messed with.Oh, have I mentioned twists earlier? And yes, I mean it in its plural sense. There are several twists in the film. The two female leads, namely Anne Hathaway's 'Selina Kyle/Catwoman' and Marion Cotillard's 'Miranda Tate', give the audience truly unexpected twists in their characters. I, myself, was caught off-guard as their reversal of roles took a 180-turn from what I'd expected them to be.Without giving too much spoilers, I'd say that it was quite refreshing and brilliant move that Nolan refuse to include Batman's sidekick, Robin, in any of his Batman franchise. Instead, he capitalized Catwoman as a potential protagonists. And damn, Hathaway gave feisty performances in all of her scenes in her own stunts. From the moment, she appeared on screen I was totally captivated by stunning performance. For one thing, forget about all that you've ever known or seen about Catwoman or Selina Kyle from past movies especially that of Michelle Pfeiffer's in the Tim Burton's version. In this one, Nolan decided to give her an edge that anyone who's ever familiar with the comics would feel like their heads are turned around.This film is also nothing short of cameos throughout from Matthew Modine to Liam Neeson. There was even a scene where a particular villain that appeared in the first two films made an appearance in this one. However, you really have to be really attentive enough to spot who it is actually. Let me give you hint: he had quite a substantial part in BATMAN BEGINS and a short scene in the earlier part of THE DARK KNIGHT. But regretfully I was pretty disappointed that Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox was not given more screen time as he did in his strong supporting role on the last film. Nevertheless, Freeman gave a fine performance no matter how trivial his role might be.Like I said earlier, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES takes a 'philosophical' stand which might not be as appealing to some audiences. They might find some scenes to be draggy or even boring as I heard yawnings at the back of the theater and some audience members even switching on their phones. Granted that I myself did find those scenes little bit too dry but that doesn't give license to these imbeciles to be inconsiderate to others the theater.Anyway as for the tagline, 'The legend ends' I would beg the differ in that the ending somehow did not feel that way at all. There's a slight hint of the appearance of 'Robin' despite Nolan's strong persistence against the sidekick's appearance.All in all, I feel like there's a certain disconnection between the last film and this one other than reminiscing on Harvey Dent's death.The verdict is that I'm definitely going to see THE DARK KNIGHT RISES again this weekend after Ramadhan's Iftar.",10,3,9,19 July 2012
