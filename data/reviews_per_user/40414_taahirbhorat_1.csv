Your Name.," A fantastic animation, Makoto Shinkai is the future
","After releasing a gradually improving set of animations including 5 centimetres per second Shinkai has really compressed everything great about his style and fixed many of the things which troubled his previous work. Make no mistake this is the type of anime able to rival such renowned Studio Ghibli titles as 'My Neighbour Toro' and 'Howl's Moving Castle'. No doubt this will soon go down as a classic. Without getting into spoilers 'Your Name' is a compelling immersive anime experience with Shinkai making many, albeit risky, decisions none more rewarding than choosing one of his favourite bands RADWIMPS to act as the soundtrack. The artwork is detailed, beautiful and crisp whilst losing nothing in the natural movements of characters. This is the animation to show people new to anime. Its universal appeal lying in the themes of young love as well as tasteful amounts of science fiction. Whilst the writing and montage scenes may at times seem out of place the films ever-changing and expanding plot makes this a film viewers will easily connect with. A truly wonderful film, and a gem amongst other anime movies in the last 5 years. Makoto Shinkai has here created what may be his magnum opus and can be certainly considered as a possible heir to to Hayao Miyazaki.",10,2,5,10 November 2016
