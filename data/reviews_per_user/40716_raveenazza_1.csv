The Double Life of Véronique," beautiful more films like this
","One of Krzysztof Kieslowski's finest films also called La Double vie de Vï¿½ronique. A philosophical, arty film its also subtle, full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives the lead actress her most challenging role. There are two women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique ( Irine Jacob). They do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer. Each has the strange feeling that she is not alone in the world. When Veronika dies onstage while singing, suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling. Although Veronika has died, but she still lives and inhabits Veronika. She explores, searching for the truth about her double life, and meets a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.This film demands to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? Like Descatres 'Demon Hypothesis'. Or about fate? Sacrifice, Love, a soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols can be interpreted in various ways successfully and more ambiguously is the end happy or sad? Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction uses light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make 'Double Life' a work of art. Metaphors about the inner states of the characters include: the stars and leaves, are the personalities of Weronika and Veronique one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpretion can be argued over endlessly. An exquisite jewel. A work for a gallery.",10,2,5,22 May 2006
