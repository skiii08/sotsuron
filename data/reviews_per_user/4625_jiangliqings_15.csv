Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sci-fi action/adventures of such gorgeously rendered detail are a rarity these days, too bad this one is a disappointment.
","** out of ****I'm not generally one of those viewers out there who feels the need to just go along with the majority opinion and hose praise or lambast a film just because that's what everyone else says.  Regardless, however, there's very little to say about Phantom Menace in general except that it IS a disappointment, not necessarily as a film in the much beloved Star Wars series, but mostly as a piece of escapist entertainment.  The fact is, while so many fans are clamoring about how it's so untrue to the rest of the series (which is actually completely untrue), the movie's real problem is that it's simply not all that well directed, well written, or well acted.Well, sure, the first Star Wars had its fair share of clunky moments, and the dialogue and acting wasn't overall anything great, but it surged forward thanks to the energetic performances, the lively direction, and the sense that everyone involved truly had fun making the film.  Oh, and let's not forget the X-wing battle in the finale, definitely one of the most exciting dog fights in movie history.  Then there's The Empire Strikes Back, a sci-fi masterpiece of imagination, true vision, and action spectacle.In comparison to those two, Phantom Menace often just feels like a sorry carbon-copy.  True, the special effects are a vast improvement, what with the digital age and all, but effects mean nothing if you can't entertain on any other level (be it dramatically, story-wise, action-wise), and let's face it, for the majority of its running time, all Menace offers for entertainment value is visual spectacle.Despite the risk of sounding like an idiot, I'll go right out and say that the plot initially confused me.  From my very first viewing, I gathered it was about some planet called Naboo that had problems with the trade federation and a couple of Jedis were going to get involved in the peace talks, or something like that.  This all eventually leads to Tatooine, where Jedi Qui-Gonn Jinn (Liam Neeson) discovers Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a young boy with the potential to be the most powerful Jedi in the world.This is the set-up, and if things hadn't been introduced so confusingly, I'd say it's not a bad way to begin a grand epic.  The movie does get off to a fairly rousing start, with John Williams' magnificent score setting the tone for what should have been great things to come.  The lightsaber fights with the robots added to the excitement, but once things hit Tatooine, this is where the movie really stumbles.  Yes, this is where we are introduced to...Jake Lloyd!This kid's performance has become something of a legend in movie lore. It's kind of like how you try your best not to mention Ishtar to a group of movie lovers (or Patch Adams to real doctors).  Really, I know Lloyd was just a nine-year old kid, but a good deal of the movie does ride on this kid's shoulders, and I don't mean this just in terms of the plot.  How superb (or not) his performance is sets up our emotional involvement in this character. Think of Empire of the Sun for a moment, which featured the most brilliant child actor performance of all time from Christian Bale (with Haley Joel Osment coming in second very closely in The Sixth Sense).  If Bale had been acting on Lloyd's level, Empire would have had an Ishtar-like fate and Spielberg would have been laughed out of Hollywood (okay, that's a little extreme but I'm trying to make a point).I see I'm just dancing around the subject, so I'll get to the point.  Plain and simple, Lloyd's performance is absolutely awful.  Now, I don't know what it was in this kid that Lucas saw, but he carries none of the emotions we would expect in a young Anakin.  Hell, he doesn't even act like a real kid. Most of the time, he just seems like what he is-a child actor desperately trying to remember his lines to the point where he can't emote.  I know most people hated Jar-Jar Binks, but this kid annoyed me so much more.  At least Jar-Jar seemed like a real individual, and for crying out loud, he was a CGI creation!Natalie Portman is better than Lloyd as Queen Amidala, but still pretty flat.  Given that Portman is indeed a talented young actress (much moreso than Carrie Fisher ever was, not to mention she's also considerably better-looking), but she never seems all that involving.  Either that, or she mistakenly believes lack of emotion is the right way to generate a sense of honor and nobility.  Whatever the reason, she's bland.Ewan Macgregor gets almost absolutely nothing to do as Obi-Wan Kenobi, except fight quite a bit, and yes indeed, he looks impressive wielding a lightsaber.  I'd say about 1/3 of his dialogue consists of the word 'Master,' which he utters a little unconvincingly at times, but he's generally okay, and I'm sure he'll have much more to work with in the sequels (whether or not it's good material remains to be seen).  And the scene where he meets Anakin for the first time, basically a cute little hello to who he believes is no more than just a cute boy, is actually quite creepy when you consider what's going to happen down the road.Of the lead performers, only Liam Neeson registers superbly.  His performance is certainly far more lively than anybody else's, and it took me much, much longer than the other actors to notice some of his dialogue was a little lackluster, a sure-fire sign of good acting.  Honor and nobility seem to come almost naturally to him, and for my money, Neeson is even better than Alec Guinness was in the original Star Wars (Gasp!  Blasphemy!).Overall, it seems interesting characters is something this movie is missing. Other than Jinn and Binks (who is amusing in an off-kilter way), the only other guy that sparked my interest was Darth Maul, played by a bad-ass Ray Parks.  Sure, he utters maybe only three lines in the whole movie, but damn, this guy has some very impressive moves.  Plus, he just looks absolutely frightening.I go to watch Star Wars to be entertained, to be swept away by a fully-realized universe, by a true epic story, by the immense action sequences.  But, alas, none of this occurs on a very consistent basis. While the sets are imaginative and amazingly crafted, pretty-looking scenery isn't going to hold my attention forever.  The story starts to feel a little dumb after awhile, especially once Lucas starts mentioning about how Jedis are determined by the amount of midi-chlorians in their blood, an explanation that put a sour taste in my mouth the first time I saw the film (but, to be fair, I've since mostly gotten over it).  Too many things happen by coincidence, and I was only further riled when one of the characters stated, 'Nothing happens by coincidence.'The action didn't impress me nearly as much as so many others, and really, there's not enough action in this movie (To be fair, I may have been slightly jaded by the delightfully entertaining The Mummy, released only two weeks earlier than Phantom Menace, and most definitely a far superior popcorn ride).  The pod race, a sort-of classic sequence now, doesn't really do it for me.  I don't know about you, but I was rooting for the kid to lose.  The four-way battle scene at the end is more impressive, but the only real thrills come in the way of the two-on-one Jedi fight that eventually results with only one man coming out alive, but this scene is intercut with other scenes of fighting that weren't particularly exciting, though had the potential to be.  I mean, that gigantic battle on the bright green field might have been more involving if Jar-Jar Binks hadn't inexplicably been placed as the general of the whole Gungan army.  I don't know about you, but I would not put the fate of a race in the hands of Jar-Jar Binks.  People stupid enough to do such a thing deserve to die.There you have it, my (useless) opinion of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, a movie that is certainly not awful but never attains the grand proportions we expected from it.  Though I notice much criticism toward the film these days, I clearly remember how so many fans clamored about just how incredible the film was during the movie's opening week in theaters.  Heck, the movie even had a rank in the top 250 on IMDB for a couple of months (coming as high as at least number 130).  Nowadays, I have a hard time finding anybody who will say anything other than, 'oh, it could have been better.'  Seems to me fans just didn't want to concede the critics might have been right.  And let's face it, I think we agree with them this time.",1,0,1,14 May 2002
Alien: Resurrection," Decent, it will either please series fans or disgust them.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ** 1/2 out of ****If anything, Alien: Resurrection has the distinction of being the most consistently paced film of the series.  Ridley Scott's Alien was fairly slow all the way, James Cameron's Aliens built up slowly and the last 1/3 of that film was a rollercoaster ride of action and terror, and David Fincher's Alien 3 mixed some highly suspenseful parts along with some slow, morose scenes.  Resurrection basically tries to get the action started as quickly as possible (which, as is typical of the genre, means halfway through the film) but before that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet tries to hold attention with some icky gore, new developments, and a wicked sense of humor.  The result is decent, certainly not bad by a long shot.The film takes place 200 years after the events of Alien 3, when Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) committed suicide inside a prison to exterminate the last of the xenomorph, a dangerous race of alien monsters.  Some of her blood was recovered by from the prison by a scientific and military team and is used to clone her.  They extract the queen and plan to create a small nest aboard their ship.  As for Ripley, her personality is different now. She's seems less human, but still has all the memories of her former life.Then a band of space pirates arrive on board the same ship, including a mechanic named Annallee Call (Winona Ryder), bringing along cargo that the military team is in need of (if you haven't figured it out by now, that cargo is humans).  But then all hell breaks loose when the aliens cleverly, if not also gruesomely, figure out a way to escape, and now the space pirates, along with Ripley and Dr. Wren, the man in charge of the whole cloning operation, must find a way to get off the ship and prevent the aliens from getting to Earth.Going over the plot, it seems writer Joss Whedon and director Jeunut were aiming for a mixture of Alien and its sequel.  The obvious fact is that you have a bunch of people trapped on a ship as they're being hunted down.  It also tries for the high-octane action of Aliens, and is fairly successful at that.  Perhaps the film's most intense sequence is an edge-of-the-seat ten-minute setpiece that first involves the survivors swimming through water until they end up in the room where all the eggs are laid and must find a way to get through as the aliens surround them.  Though the remainder of the film afterward is still tense, no other scenes maintain as much suspense as that setpiece.  But still, Jeunet proves himself a director capable of creating excitement and the film never tested my patience once.Other good aspects of the film include the special effects, which are actually slightly less than Cameron's film because of the use of CGI, which isn't nearly as convincing when the creatures are animatronic.  Jeunet's cinematography is vivid and distinct, and the use of humor is effective at times.  The cast (with one signifcant exception) is good, with Sigourney Weaver delivering another fine performance as Weaver, though you can't help but feel at times it might have been better if they'd thought of something else other than cloning to buttress the plot.  The other standout is Ron Pearlman, whose wise-cracking character gets the best lines.Not everything in this movie is good, however.  The fact that the storyline is a mixture of the first and second installments makes predictibility a factor, and there's never really a doubt as to who lives and who dies. Then there's also the whole cloning issue, and the fact that it is used in this movie goes to show that the filmmakers trying to take the easy way out. To be fair, they did pull it off in a more convincing (and disturbing) manner than I expected so credit should be given for that.If nobody noticed, except for those ten-minutes I mentioned, there's not exactly a whole lot of non-stop slam-bang action, it's mostly sporadic throughout.  Though, I must say what is present is gory enough to jolt even the most hardened series fan.  This is easily the goriest film in the series, surpassing the original by quite a bit.Then there's that one casting mistake I mentioned previously and that goes to Winona Ryder.  It pains me to say this, considering the fact that I admire her very much and is among my favorite actresses.  But she's pretty much a miscast as the character Annallee Call.  Whether it's that haircut, which is a short one (keep the hair long, Winona, you look extremely beautiful that way!), or the long bouts of shouting she's forced to do, she comes off unconvincing and had me wishing they'd replaced her with someone like up-and-comer Radha Mitchell, whose performance in her own respective sci-fi thriller Pitch Black shows her quite adroit at playing a strong heroine.The biggest problem series fans have with this film is introduction of the new alien.  First of all, give Jeunet and the special effects crew credit once again for trying something different and original.  The alien design is not as good as H.R. Giger's but I didn't find it annoying or bothersome, either.  Just as a sidenote, the way this creature dies may very well be the most gruesome death I've ever seen so don't be surprised if you actually feel a little sorry for it.At this point, another addition to the series seems unlikely since Weaver is unwilling for another run at it, which is both a good and bad thing.  You can take the fact that the series won't go into overkill, but the final reels of Resurrection hint at the prospect of another installment that could take place on Earth, which is exactly what series fans have been clamoring for.  It may never happen, but either way at least Alien: Resurrection wasn't a shameful way to end the series.",Null,0,0,10 February 2001
The 13th Warrior," This would have been a zero if not for some exciting action scenes and an expensive production design.
","* 1/2 out of ****The 13th Warrior is a film that has somehow managed to get a wide appreciation from so many audiences.  How this has happened is way beyond me.  As escapist entertainment, there's hardly enough excitement to make the film worth watching.  As a serious in-depth look at Viking society, it's dreadful, repellant, and not particularly accurate.  All I see here is a fairly boring and plotless film full of unpleasant imagery.I suppose it's relatively impossible for any movie not to have a plot. Thus, the 'story,' as this one goes, begins with the journeys of Ahmed Ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas), a writer banished from his country because he was in love with a rich man's wife (and presumably, she back to him).  He ends up hooking up with some Viking warriors and stays a bit longer than he hoped to as he realizes he has been chosen as the 13th warrior.  Without his acknowledgement or permission, he has been enlisted to fight a ferocious enemy that has been assaulting another Viking village.  What pretty much follows is another rendition of The Seven Samurai.It's obvious The 13th Warrior has aspirations to be an epic, and I'm not certain if large portions were cut out of the movie, but it's only 100 minutes.  Not that I'm really complaining since it's already dull enough as it is, but that's a bit surprising to see a short-length 'epic.'  There are some action scenes and they are exciting when on-screen, but it's not enough to sustain the movie for its entirety.  The movie features about twenty minutes of excitement, and nearly 80 minutes of complete boredom. Director John Mctiernan is a skilled action filmmaker, as he has proven with Die Hard.  Here, he helms some well-done setpieces, such as a large-scale nighttime invasion that looks disastrous for the village.  The warriors' venture into the cave near the end is also pretty effective.  However, Mctiernan also makes some terrible decisions in this film when it comes to some of the action.  Though the battle scenes are fairly exciting, they're hindered by the night-time setting (it's either that or the overwrought slow motion).  It would have been nice to see what the heck was going during some of these action-filled moments.When there's no action on-screen, everything slows down to a snail's pace, with little of anything to maintain any interest.  Mctiernan tries to build this up as a horror film, too, for some odd reason, almost as if though he thinks that we would be convinced that this ferocious enemy is really an army of demons when it's quite obvious it's just a group of people wearing bear skin.  The revelation is a little unintenionally funny, as you have to wonder how long it took for these characters to figure it out (most especially Banderas, who seems to have the most common sense but shows little during his 'it's a man' bout).Some other things here are just plain stupid.  (minor spoiler) The one-on-one fight between Buliwyf and the queen is a little too in favor of the Viking, seeing how it is he has a sword as big as a man and she's got a claw with very slow-acting poison.  Plus, the Vikings go all the way down to this cave to take down this queen, and they accomplish their task and leave, but Banderas later finds out that in order to stop the army you have to kill the male leader.  Why the hell didn't they just do that in the cave? 
The movie has an expensive look to it, and you can tell a good bit of that 100 million dollar budget was spent on giving the movie it's grimy medieval setting.  It's also damned unpleasant to look at.  With so much mud, blood, disgusting characters, and body parts it's headache-inducing after a while. Oh, sure, I can take gore (quite easily, too) when it's in the service of a rousing story (a la Braveheart) or outrageous-style violence (George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead).  But here, you just want to turn the film off and get a breath of fresh air outside.  People are being hacked up for the sake just getting hacked up.  I mean, I know war is senseless but in this movie's case this is just ridiculous.   The performances don't help much at all.  Antonio Banderas and Diane Venora are the only two people I'm familiar with.  Banderas tries his best to be likable and charismatic, but any charm of his is quickly counteracted by all the unpleasantness. Venora is given the thankless of job of appearing as his new lover, then just as quickly disappearing.  Vladimir Kulich plays the lead Viking, Buliwyf, and I think I recognize the actor from the awful TV miniseries Pandora's Clock as the crazy suicidal pilot.  Anyway, Buliwyf is obviously an inspiration from Beowulf, but this movie wouldn't make a particularly good substitute for the poem.  Kulich acts the part as he's supposed to, I guess, which means to basically thrash a huge sword around at people.  The actor (don't know his name) who plays the Viking who befriends Banderas is actually pretty good and somewhat likable.  Everyone else is, for a lack of a better word, obligatory.I've heard many reports about the troubles this film went through. Apparently, author Michael Crichton was upset with the way the movie was going and had Mctiernan fired (or maybe Mctiernan left, I'm not sure), then re-shot certain scenes himself.  I have no idea what contributions he made and I don't think it made one bit of difference.  All I see is a below mediocre effort at making a blood-soaked, exhilarating epic.",Null,0,1,5 August 2001
The Mummy," Dazzlingly fun action/adventure film clicks on all cylinders.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *** 1/2 out of ****The recent box office success of The Mummy Returns has given me cause to re-examine its predecessor.  Most of the critical response to the sequel has been mixed, with the majority of the critics stating it's weak when compared to the original.  Movie audiences have been far kinder, many stating it's better than the original and some saying it's even better than Raiders of the Lost Ark!  Naturally, I took the time to look back at The Mummy, the film that opened the summer of 1999.The film was by no means the most anticipated blockbuster of the summer. That honor belonged to more hyped up films like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and the Austin Powers sequel, but the box office numbers for The Mummy shocked everyone.  I saw the movie for myself and found myself agreeing with many critics and viewers, the film is by far the most fun I've had in a movie theater in nearly ten years, since I last saw Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.  The Mummy is a rollicking thrill ride, a blend of action/adventure/humor with a nice dash of romance that keeps things moving along at a lightning pace.  Best of all, the characters were memorable and the action sequences were thrilling and exciting.The plot isn't anything that's Oscar worthy, but it does set up a fun premise.  In the times of Ancient Egypt, a priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was having an affair with the Pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez).  The Pharaoh discovers this matter of infidelity, which forces Imhotep and his lover to kill him.  As punishment, the Pharaoh's guards execute Anck Su Namun, and in despair, Imhotep takes her lifeless body to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, in hopes of restoring her spirit to her body.  In the middle of the process, the Pharaoh's guards interfere, the ritual is left unfinished, and Imhotep and all his priests are killed and mummified.  Imhotep's body, in particular, must be guarded at all times, for an ancient curse has been placed on it and if he is awakened, he could bring the end of the world.The story cuts to the 1920's, with a lovely but ditzy librarian named Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) intrigued by her brother Jonathan's (John Hannah) latest discovery, a key with a map that could lead to Hamunaptra. Unfortunately, the map is burned so they must rely on the man who had been in possession of the key, a former legionaire named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser).He leads the small group into the desert, with a rivalling team led by a former acquaintance of O'Connell's named Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), who is leading  a group of Americans.  They reach the lost city at the same time, and while O'Connell's team discovers the mummified body of Imhotep, the Americans retrieve the mysterious Book of the Dead.Evelyn, who is developing romantic feelings towards O'Connell, is interested in the other group's discovery.  She steals the Book of the Dead from them and reads several passages aloud, with horrifying results.  Imhotep is awakened and is on a quest to gain power and revive his lost love, Anck Su Namun.  To accomplish this, he must first kill the men who found the book and sacrifice Evelyn.  It is now up to O'Connell, Jonathan, and a mysterious cult leader named Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) to stop the mummy before his reign of terror spreads over the world.The film's director and writer, Stephen Sommers, must be really well-versed in adventure films.  He knows how to bring out the boyhood sense of fun in nearly every scene, and he never fails to do anything less than make this a rousing thrill ride.  He never does anything particularlyl innovative, but his ability to breathe life into the adventure genre again is refreshing. His emphasis on characters and humor make this a more satisfying experience than most other summer blockbusters.  It's nice to see a movie that has true intentions of entertaining the audience, and not just try to make a quick buck.The action sequences are a partial reason for the movie's success. Sommers tries out something different for every action scene.  There are gunfights, swordfights, tense chase scenes, and a breathtaking sandstorm.  But Sommers wisely doesn't exhaust you with non-stop action.  The real non-stop thrills don't begin until the 1-hour mark.  He does a nice job of building the momentum with adventure, humor, and romance.Speaking of the romance, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have an undeniable amount of sizzling chemistry.  They work well together and it would be nice to see them in a film outside of this genre.  Fraser is the perfect choice for the ruggedly handsome hero.  He does a great job for the physical parts and his charisma is just as strong as his acting.  Weisz does end up mostly playing the damsel in distress, but there's great fun in that acknowledgement and she plays her part quite well.  Plus, the fact that she's very cute doesn't hurt matters.  John Hannah as the comic relief is quite hilarious.  Some of the jokes he's given aren't necessarily funny but his delivery is so dead-on, I couldn't help but laugh.
The lead trio have the most presence.  The actors playing the villains don't really have much dialogue.  Arnold Vosloo is a menacing physical presence and though he doesn't say much he does ooze with a certain sense of icky creepiness (could be due to those mummy effects).  Patricia Velazquez doesn't do much other wear some skimpy clothing.  As a mummy, she basically shrieks her way through the role.  Once again, it's not as if though these villains really need to be well-defined.Sommers' script isn't anything brilliant by a long shot, but it's a very entertaining and well-spun tale, which is better than what can be said for most big-budget summer films.  The dialogue, though sometimes seemingly corny, actually works perfectly and is often quite hilarious.  The humor, obviously intentional from all standpoints, keeps the movie's pacing tight and adds an extra degree of fun to the whole production.Sommers also injects the film with the right tone and mood.  It's hardly a frightening film, and that's certainly not the point.  He keeps things on a light-hearted, though still tense and thrilling, level.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and as a result it's a movie experience that's all the better for it.  We've already had a horror-related film about a mummy, and it was time for something more cinematically rousing, which is definitely Sommers' intent.The special effects are quite outstanding.  The initial sight of the mummy is obviously far too CGI, but it works within the film's tone.  Having a seriously scary-looking monster would have ruined the slight tongue-in-cheek attitude the movie was going for.  The rest of the visuals are great.  The design of Hamunaptra is convincingly ancient and mystical.  The large wave of locusts and beetles are also a sight to behold, but the film's best effect is the sandstorm, which Sommers films from the perfect angles, giving us a sense of how immense in size and scope it is.The Mummy has obviously had the largest lasting impression of 1999's summer films.  It may not have the money of Phantom Menace or the innovative visuals of The Matrix, but it's a film that is superb because it succeeds in what it promises to do, and that's to thrill and entertain you for a couple of hours, and it has no pretensions about doing so.",10,0,0,19 May 2001
The Killing Fields," Incredible portrayal of friendship, one man's struggle to survive, and an apocalyptic vision of hell on Earth.
","**** out of ****After nearly 20 years The Killing Fields still remains one of the most powerful films ever made, a brilliant piece of moviemaking that leaves a searing imprint in the mind long after viewing it.  This is not a film to be taken lightly, but a serious examination of the horrors of war and individual conflicts and struggles, and for that it is on par with Steven Spielberg's work on Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, certainly a noteworthy comparison.  The film opens in 1973, with the Vietnam War coming to an end.  But the horror is far from over.  The Khmer Rouge, a radical political group, are slowly taking over war-torn Cambodia.  The film's first 2/3's chronicles the journeys and friendships of two journalists, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), as well as photographer Al Rockoff (John Malkovich) and another photographer, a British man named Jon Swain (Julian Sands).The American Embassy makes the crucial decision to evacuate but Schanberg refuses to leave, and his partner Pran, out of a sense of loyalty, also willingly stays behind while his family is evacuated.  But trouble ensues, and Pran is eventually forced to remain in Cambodia and must struggle to survive re-education camps and the Killing Fields.Of all the films to involve the Vietnam War (technically, though, the focus of this is on Cambodia), The Killing Fields ranks above them all.  It is even more harrowing than Oliver Stone's Platoon, more realistic than Apocalypse Now and Full Metal jacket, and more intensely personal than The Deer Hunter.  This film remains something of a forgotten relic, losing the Best Picture award of 1984 to the undeserving Amadeus, but The Killing Field's importance and impact have remained, and perhaps by today's standards, has an even more terrifying imprint.Perfectly directed, this easily remains director Roland Joffe's best work to date (and he'll probably never surpass it).  It's something of a tragedy to see him take a step backward with every film he has gone on to make (The Mission, the disastrous The Scarlet Letter).  But his work on this film is still by far one of the most impressive I've seen in this genre.  He captures the insanity of the time period, the political confusion, the chaos, and the downright terrors of war; doing all of this not from a soldier's point of view, but from civilians, most particularly Dith Pran.The war-torn chaos featured in the first hour-and-a-half give way to an intense struggle for survival in the last hour.  The focus is on Dith Pran and the tortures he goes through.  It is here that the film takes an apocalyptic look and stance, and the sight of hundreds of dead bodies in a long, single ditch remains one of the most horrifying and shocking sights ever put on film.Suspenseful is a way to describe the film, yet it is far more nail-biting than the usual Hollywood-churned thriller.  It's impressive how director Joffe creates so much tension from so many situations.  From the beginning when we see the evacuation to the point where the journalists try to fake a passport to keep Pran in the embassy; all these moments are simply heart-pounding.Those scenes seem almost obligatory in comparison to the last 1/3, which focuses on Pran almost entirely.  Every scene in these last 50 mintues, I was left constantly praying and hoping he'd make it out and I literally gripped my seat every moment, wondering whether he'd be discovered or whether he'd be able to escape. The film is so riveting not only because of Joffe's direction, but also because of the individual characters whom we grow to not only care for, but also feel like we're in the same situation with.  Haing Ngor carries the load as Dith Pran, and comes through magnificently.  Having faced the actual terrors of war in Cambodia, Ngor is brilliantly effective, and he easily delivered what must have been the best performance of the 80's. 
Sam Waterston is almost as good as Sydney Schanberg, Pran's close friend who feels guilty for having let Pran stay behind during the evacuation.  It is his drive to get the news down that places Pran in danger, and though we're aware of this, there's never a moment when we aren't touched by Waterston's torn feelings.  This is his best performance to date.The supporting cast is also very good, most notably John Malkovich as the photographer who seems a little odd at first, but is pretty much the average guy who also sympathizes for Pran's plight (and, as a result, ends up arguing with Schanberg).  Julian Sands is also effective as the photographer whose life as well as Schanberg's and Rockoff's, was saved by Pran and he tries his best to return the favor.The Killing Fields, while certainly a bloody violent film and almost always depresses the hell out of you, is ultimately more inspirational than anything else.  This may be a flinching, no-holds barred experience, but it is one that must be seen.  This is truly an unforgettable film, and one of my personal favorites.",10,2,4,10 July 2001
The Shining," The Simpsons' parody was more entertaining.
","* 1/2 out of ******SPOILERS** Just by reading my headline summary of The Shining, I'm guessing there are going to be a lot of fans thinking 'Oh, it's just another average Joe out there who just doesn't 'understand' Kubrick and his films.'  Okay, I suppose I could take a pretentious insult like that.  But what I do understand is that from the opening scenes, this movie reeks of filmmaking incompetence. You can clearly see, during the aerial view of the car heading towards the Overlook Hotel, the helicopter's shadow on the bottom right-hand side of your screen.  Even worse than that has to be the clear view of the helicopter blades on the top of the screen during the first shot of the hotel itself.  I seriously doubt Kubrick and company filmed this intentionally.But, seriously, The Shining is easily one of the most overrated movies of its genre.  I'm a huge fan of horror, moreso than the average viewer, but I can't see how so many people could back a movie that's obviously second-rate on so many levels.  As anybody who's seen the movie knows, it's based off of Stephen King's popular novel (To be honest, it was never really one of my favorites of his, though still a decent book).  Jack Torrance (Played by a hilariously overwrought Jack Nicholson) is a struggling writer who takes up the job as caretaker of the luxurious Overlook Hotel for the winter, along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and young son, Danny.  Unfortunate for them, a blizzard holes them in and Nicholson starts to grow insane.Not much of a plot, is there?  Truthfully, I'm not one of those people out there who believes in strict adherence to the source material.  If a movie can diverge from the book it's based on and still come through as grade-A quality, it's got my respect.  But Kubrick doesn't just diverge, he leaves out major parts of the plot completely.  No back story is offered about the hotel and why it's haunted, there's not even a slight hint given as to who Tony is, the imaginary boy that Danny speaks to.  There's a big difference between trying to scare the audience with the unknown and just totally alienating the viewer by not explaining a thing, and this movie accomplishes the latter. And I do believe that this movie is called The Shining, which is the name Scatman Crother's character gives for a certain telepathic power that Danny has.  So how come this power is of very little consequence to the plot?  The only time it's really intentionally used is just to get someone over to the hotel, and if you've seen the movie, you'll know how pointless that was.I can just hear the fans clamoring that the success of this movie has little to do with King's original plot, but Kubrick's direction.  To that, I can only laugh.  Oh, it's not like he doesn't try to give the movie a foreboding atmosphere or a stylish look, it's just that he kind of fails in these regards.  The ominous aerial shots, a little cool at first, grow a bit hilarious after the fifth time it's done, especially with the banging music playing over the background, as if to remind us 'Brace yourself for the horror to come!'Kubrick also relies heavily on long tracking shots, a la Brian De Palma. Initially, it works in creating the sense that this hotel is indeed humongous, but I pretty much got the point after the first hour.  Kubrick continues these shots incessantly throughout the ENTIRE film (148 minutes!), with almost no end in sight.  Even De Palma would have known when enough is enough.When it comes to this movie's running time, two-and-a-half hours doesn't seem all that long compared to some other King films (The Stand, Storm of the Century, and The Shining remake).  But Kubrick paces this film at the speed of molasses, making sure that everybody says their dialogue as slowly as possible, making sure that his camera catches as much of the hotel as slowly as possible, making sure...you probably know what I'm trying to get at.  There's a difference between deliberate pacing (2001, Kubrick's real masterpiece) and simply being boring and talky, and The Shining is most definitely the latter.And it's not as if though I can't appreciate a slow build-up, but as I said before, this build-up isn't particularly well-done and every time a certain segment gets interesting, Kubrick cuts away and kills off the momentum by introducing each new part with silly subheadings like 'The Interview,' 'A Month Later,' and 'Tuesday.'  It's funny that I hear complaints about the subheadings for Sphere ALL the time, but never once for this film.  I don't know about you, but a subheading like 'The Interview' hardly sounds foreboding or preparation for the horror ahead, and I very much doubt Kubrick intention was to throw us off guard from the 'horror' with such a workmanlike heading.Kubrick's ideas of pay-off for a slow build-up aren't very inspiring.  We get a naked woman in a bathtub who then becomes a naked, old woman standing out of that bathtub.  She cackles like a witch at Nicholson, and then Nicholson proceeds to...back off slowly.  This isn't a particularly ambitious ghost, since it seems entirely content with just cackling. Still, this is the only real scene I can think of in which Kubrick actually utilizes the whole 'haunted house' motif which, by the way, is considerably more interesting than seeing Nicholson go insane.When that does eventually occur, Kubrick decides to film virtually all the chases OUTSIDE the hotel.  I mean, this hotel is like a huge mansion, a perfect opportunity for cat-and-mouse chases, and like much of the film, the potential is once again wasted.  The chase outiside in the hedges isn't bad, but the outcome was never in doubt.Now that I've bashed Kubrick's filmmaking, it's on to the performances. WIth three principal actors for the majority of the running time, it's important the acting is very good.  Too bad it's not.  Jack Nicholson's overacting is so ridiculous, it would put Charlton Heston to shame.  Hell, there's not even an attempt to make us sympathize with Torrance's plight. Shelley Duvall registers pretty badly as his wife, not quite as awful as I've heard, but she's pretty damn annoying.  The kid who plays Danny never seems like anything more than a child actor trying to act disturbed (For better peformances with similar themes in mind, watch the far superior The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes).  Scatman Crothers is easily the best of the cast, but (spoiler) he's only here to give the film a body count.  It's almost as if though Kubrick thought he would lose the audience's attention if he didn't try putting in a visceral kill scene, and it's hard not to lose respect for him for doing that.The Shining, bad as it often is, still has its moments (Since it's directed by Kubrick, how could it not?).  The scene where Shelley Duvall flips through hundreds of papers stating the same phrase is a real spine-tingler, the only scene that's remotely frightening.  When it's hinted that something evil lurks inside room 237, it makes for a fairly creepy scene when the kid stands right outside that room's door (Of course, when you find out what's inside, it's hard not to be a little disappointed).  But considering that a big deal is made out of this room, it's more than a little annoying that no explanation is given for what happened inside.  The score, overdone as it may sometimes be, is still pretty decent and probably scarier than almost anything else this film has to offerSo, I suppose that's all I've got to say about Kubrick's rendition of The Shining, a movie which could have been so much more but ended up going nowhere.  There was, of course, a remake, most of which I've seen, and yes, I liked it considerably more (Though it has been five years since I've seen that version).  For a film that combines the talents of Stanley Kubrick, Stephen King, and Jack Nicholson it's hard not to be disappointed with the outcome (I will make explicitly clear that none of this is really King's fault, considering he wasn't all that pleased with Kubrick's film itself and that he had nothing to do with the making of the movie).",Null,6,14,1 March 2002
The Patriot," The year's biggest disappointment (yet still watchable).
","** 1/2 stars out of ****It pains me to give The Patriot anything below ***.  Simply put, with Mel Gibson in the title role of a man fighting for his family and his country, I was expecting an historical epic that could somewhat reach the heights of Braveheart.  It didn't happen, but that's not to say The Patriot was a bad movie, which is not the case by a long shot.It's around the beginning of the Revolutionary War in America (specifically, South Carolina for this film), fighting for independence from England. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a widower and father of 7, hopes to shelter his family from the horrors of war, but his attempts are rendered futile when his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), disobeys him and enlists.After a few campaigns and battle defeats, Gabriel manages to return home, but insists he must go because he had been ordered to send dispatches. The British also arrive at the Martin residence, led by Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs), who takes Gabriel prisoner and has Martin's second child, Thomas, killed.Enraged, Martin ambushes the men escorting Gabriel, frees his son, and has them sheltered in the home of his sister-in-law, Charlotte (Joely Richardson).  But Gabriel refuses to stay, and returns to the army, with his father following aside.  Both eventually join and form a militia, which now has the assignment of trying to slow down General Cornwallis as long as possible and hold him in the south so the French can arrive in time.  At the same time they are taking down the British with ambushes, Colonel Tavington plans of a way to take down Martin and his colonial militia.The Patriot has so many things wrong with it that I'm surprised I didn't give it ** stars instead.  First off, the storyline is dull and cliched. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Robert Rodat's script is often unengaging and lacks the depth so vital to an historical drama.  He and director Roland Emmerich seem to be more concerned with 'inspiring' subplots and cliches than real drama.  Consider the unnecessary side stories involving a slave who has to prove himself in battle, the daughter who won't speak to her father, etc., and you've got a movie that wastes too much time on material that really isn't all that important.Another flaw in the script is Rodat's obsession with injecting a lot of the humor into the film.  I have no problem with that, but only 1/4 of the humor actually works, and it wears out fast after the first viewing, thus making the humor look out of place and even corny on a second viewing.But let me go into what is good in the movie.  The action scenes are impressively choreographed and the first ambush attack-with Gibson rescuing his son-is simply a magnificently done sequence, a white-knuckle set piece with true emotional power.  Had there been more scenes like this, The Patriot would have been a fantastic film.  The last battle itself is an exciting and long sequence, but features lttle compelling power or drama. Emmerich proves adept at handling action scenes, but does little to create true depth, instead often resorting to manipulation.The Patriot does have more action sequences than The last of the Mohicans and Glory, but you'd be surprised by the sometimes sluggish pace (as compared to the tight pacing of those aforementioned films).  When the movie's not on the battlefield, it can get quite slow moving (and even during the skirmishes, the annoying overuse of unstylish slow motion gets on your nerves after a while).  The fact is, the story is simply not executed well enough to maintain tight and undivided interest for 165 minutes.The performances are actually quite strong and help to lift the movie above its flawed script.  Mel Gibson is as great as ever, and his terrific portrayal of a man torn by family and country is one of his best performances yet.  Jason Isaacs is equally good as the villain.  His Colonel Tavington is convincingly cold and calculating.  Heath Ledger turns in a stellar performance, and his co-star/love interest Lisa Brenner is decent (though her church speech is almost over-the-top).  The lovely and underrated Joely Richardson is good as Gibson's love interest but doesn't enough screen time to flesh out her character completely.  She also tends to speak rather slowly, as if though she's having a hard time trying to dispell her British accent.  The rest of the supporting cast is adequate, though some of the militia characters can get quite annoying.On the technical side, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is at times gorgeous and the costumes and sets are convincing.  John Williams score is a mixed bag.  The haunting and foreboding elements of the score-particularly in the scene where Isaacs knocks the tomahawk out of Gibson's hand in their fight-work very well and is at times a terrible beauty to listen to.  The patriotic score, however, is too overly jingoistic and just too cheery.So, The Patriot didn't quite turn out to be that glorious epic I was hoping for, but it's by all means a watchable movie, one that I recommend with and/or despite some reservations.  This year's true epics are really Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Gladiator, but The Patriot is a decent outing for those looking for some sweeping spectacle.",1,0,2,12 January 2001
Independence Day," It's average, no more, no less.
","** out of ****It's been a while now since Independence Day had been a reigning box office champ.  I remember all the hype and media coverage over it.  The film broke box office records and had people clamoring over it.  Well, it's pretty much a forgotten film now, as nobody seems to really mention it anymore.  Either the ones that receive awful reviews (Battlefield Earth) or good to great reviews (Star Wars, The Matrix) are the big-budget sci-fi films that stay remembered.  Independence is just relentlessly mediocre.Taking place over the course of 3 days (basically the first 3 of July), the film begins with a gigantic spacecraft hovering over the moon.  Separate pieces disentangle itself from the mothership, 36 in all, and position themselves over the world's most powerful cities.  At this point, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is undecided as to what course of action to take.  Should they wait, or fire upon the alien ships.A brilliant cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum)-no kidding-figures out that the aliens are using a code through Earth's own satellites, and is actually a countdown, and when the clock ticks to zero, all of Earth will be decimated in a hailstorm of lasers.  He manages to warn the president in time (he's the ex-husband of one of the president's advisors, no less), and they evacuate just before the ships fire down on the cities, and soon 36 of the world's largest and most powerful cities have been reduced to rubble.The humans aim for a counterattack, with fighter jets to take down the ships, but as Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and his squad figure out, these ships have some sort of force field that prevent penetration from any object.  With the exception of himself, Hiller's squad is completely destroyed, and he ends up in the deserts of Nevada, dragging an unconscious alien.  Eventually, all the characters meet in Area 51, buried secrets of the past are unearthed, and discussions and plans of ways of fighting back are brought into light.There's really nothing to get excited about concerning this film.  It has a few exciting action scenes, some humorous bits, and a barrage of outstanding special effects, but it's rather dissatisfying.  There's not nearly as much action as you would hope for, and I would like to have seen some hand-to-hand combat, not just some aerial dogfights.  The movie is basically hollow entertainment, and even then, it tries the patience with the slow buildup in the first hour.  If you want entertaining and non-stop sci-fi action, go with Starship Troopers, and if you want a better film a similar storyline, then just stick with Star Wars.Roland Emmerich isn't exactly a director that's well known for helming compelling scripts and Independence Day is no different.  The screenplay features a bevy of plot holes and blatant stupidity, most of which appear in the final half hour, as the ridiculous plan to fight back the aliens strikes me as lame-brained.  Emmerich is adept at handling special effects and action, but a good bit of it feels like it's for naught with some of the outright idiocy of the story behind it.The performances are merely average.  Will Smith is a lot of fun to watch as the hero, and he does turn in the most likeable and charismatic performance. Jeff Goldblum plays a genius as usual, and he's good at it, too.  It's just that everyone else is not so good.  Bill Pullman is pretty stiff, and while others do manage to put life into their roles, there's not nearly enough screentime given to them to put any signifigance into it.I suppose now that all the sound and fury is over, Independency Day really doesn't add up to too much, it's a major disappointment.  It's nowhere near being awful, but it has too many flaws to make this a film worth watching over and over again.",5,1,3,21 January 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Spielberg's direction and the special effects make up for the flaws in this intensely entertaining ride.
","*** out of ****With Jurassic Park III to be released in a month, it will be interesting to see if new director Joe Johnston can outdo Spielberg's work in the previous two installments.  He's got a lot to live up to, because while the stories haven't always been spectacular, Jurassic Park was excellent escapist entertainment and The Lost World is a worthy, albeit significantly flawed, sequel.  It's been 4 years since the disaster that occurred at Jurassic Park.  The company's new CEO, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) has dissolved his Uncle John Hammond's (Richard Attenborogh) and has plans to create a new park right in San Diego.  Hammond quickly forms a team to rival Ludlow's, which is led by chaotician/mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).  Also along for the ride are photographer/Earth man Nick Van Park (Vince Vaughn), communications expert Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff), and Malcolm's girlfriend and palentologist, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), with Malcolm's daughter also along as a stowaway.Apparently, the island they're headed for is called Site B, where they actually manufactured and created the dinosaurs, then sent them over to the park.  When Ludlow's team arrives, with the help of a big-game hunter named Roland Tumbo (Pete Postlethwaite), they entrap several dinosaurs, including an injured baby tyrannosaurus rex.  Nick releases the animals and brings the injured rex back to the group's trailers, and chaos ensues when the parents looking for their child, leaving the team's supplies destroyed and short one team member.  They are forced to team up with Ludlow and Tumbo, and they must reach the island village to raise communication and rescue.I'm a little surprised to say that I liked and enjoyed this film quite a bit.  I'll mention the flaws first. The story's often quite weak, most of the characters are rote and sometimes downright stupid, and the film lacks the predecessor's sense of awe.  Let me go into the characters first.  Believe it or not, the ones that annoy us the most are those in the 'good guys' team.  Julianne Moore's Sarah Harding is a complete moron.  She claims the team is on the island to study and not interact, yet she goes right up and pets a baby stegosaurus on the head, then gets all the other dinosaurs in that nest riled up.  She also carries around this 'lucky' backpack, often leaves it lying around places where some small dinosaur could come by, then even carries it around when it's covered in blood!  Smart, especially when that giant t-rex comes by looking for food and territory.Vince Vaughn (who, incidentally, appeared with Moore in the Psycho remake) makes a very small impression as Nick Van Park.  His character stupidly brings back an injured and growling baby t-rex, which puts his colleagues in danger and results in another person's death, and he never even seems the least bit sorry for it.  Vaughn's decision to play him as a rather understated man is commendable, but he doesn't make much of an impression. Vanessa Lee Chester is absolutely useless as Ian Malcolm's daughter.  I'm sure she was just used to appeal to the younger crowd but that just puts a jarring difference in the film's tone, which is usually dark and violent. She gets the worst lines, delivers them unconvincingly, and also has a ludicrous scene where she uses gymnastics to kill a raptor.  I was just rooting for these three to get eaten before the film was over.  Alas, that was not to happen.There are other problems I could go into but I'll go with what I do like, and the good outweighs the bad quite a bit.  Spielberg's direction is first-rate (maybe not for him, but certainly in comparison to most other action directors).  I've always considered him cinema's best action/thriller director and he doesn't disappoint here.  The action and suspense sequences are tense and thrilling.I have some particularly favorite moments.  I loved the scene with Moore lying on the end of the trailer with the glass slowly cracking with every small move she makes.  All the scenes that involve the raptors are probably the film's best.  Each raptor attack is intense and engaging.  The main focus this time is on the t-rex, and the big boy (and girl if you include the mother) doesn't disappoint.  The t-rex is an immense and fearsome sight, and it's fun to behold a creature of this stature in a contrast between the jungle and suburbia.John Williams' score is also effective in creating some tension.  The score is a bit different than his composition in Jurassic Park, it's slightly weaker and features a lot of annoyind drum-banging (as with almost every island adventure flick) but he hits more right notes than wrong ones.If there's a flaw in these exciting moments, it's Spielberg's decision to film virtually all of it during the night.  While there is an oppressive atmosphere in that condition, it gets annoying after a while.  As a matter of fact, as I think about it, nearly the last hour of the film takes place in complete darkness.The special effects are every bit as awesome as they were in Jurassic Park, and there are even more and different dinosaurs in this film.  The stegosaurus makes an appearance and the procompsagnathus are an appropriately cute and menacing sight.  Along with the variety of dinos comes an increase in violence.  I'm sure the PG-13 rating must have been a close call.  There are chewed up bodies, gory dinosaur graveyards, ferocious dino attacks, and a severed hand (which actually gets an unintentional laugh from me) (When you see that scene, ask yourself where the body went).  This film is definitely too intense for younger children.  The acting is not bad, though with the exception of Goldblum and Postlethwaite, they're all completely overshadowed by the dinosaurs. Goldblum is funny and amusing as Ian Malcolm, and though his character is sometimes a little irritating he's an absolute genius in comparison to his group members.  Postlethwaite as the hunter is quite an interesting character.  His indifference to anything except for his best friend Ajay and the hunt is fascinating; pity it's not developed very well.  Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow is okay, as good as possible a person can do playing a one-dimensional villain.There was an extended television version released, though despite one brief humorous scene involving a man hitting his crotch, it's more of hindrance by holding off the dinosaur action by an extra six or so minutes.  It's not particularly compelling to watch a group of business executives talking about...well, business.The film's conclusion is weak in my opinion.  Spielberg's decision to change the setting to somewhere closer to home is obviously a change of pace and while it's something new, it's not necessarily what's best.  But to his credit, I was so enthralled by the action that I was feeling lenient by the time the end reels began.  This is by no means a masterpience or a match to the original, but it makes for 129 minutes (135 if you see the TV version) of raptor-paced entertainment.  I've read some initial plot summaries on Jurassic Park III and the story doesn't sound like any great shakes, so director Joe Johnston's only chance of success is making it as exciting as this film or the original.  And, hey, he'll also have Sam Neill in the lead role, who was sorely missed in The Lost World.",8,1,2,25 May 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," Slow for a while, but then it's non-stop action and thrills to the end.
","** 1/2 out of ****Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn might surprise those who are watching it without any prior knowledge to the plot.  It begins much like a crime/road drama, with two criminal brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), getting into a shootout in a convenience store.  They end up losing a few hostages.  Their plan is to get to Mexico and meet with an associate.  Thus, they are forced to take a former preacher, Jacob (Harvey Keitel), and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) by gunpoint.  Using their RV with Jacob at the wheel, they get past the border, stop at a seedy strip bar out in the middle of nowhere, and are in for a big and unpleasant surprise.After a hectic shootout and some funny, quirky dialogue in the opening, the movie does develop quite slowly and is buoyed only by the occasional interesting bit of dialogue (which is trademark Tarantino).  A few of the characters we've been introducted to do up to this point are fairly interesting, but are a little underused or are simply excessive in whatever they do.  I was finding myself rather bored by the proceedings. But once they reach the bar, all hell breaks loose, as our 'heroes' unpleasantly discover that the bar is owned by vampires, and for the last 45 minutes From Dusk Till Dawn is a non-stop ride of action, thrills, and campy dark humor.
The action is the film's main showcase and it's fast-paced, violent, and exciting.  It makes John Carpenter's attempt at high-energy in Vampires look lethargic in comparison.  The film offers some creative ways to kill vampires, and it's all so hectic there's not a chance you'll be bored.  I haven't seen Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi, but if he shows the same kinetic style here it'll be another wild ride.  All the action here is set in the bar (it's a rather large one, too), making it an obvious poke at Night of the Living Dead because of that film's own confined setting.  Of course, instead of zombies we've got the undead of the blooksucking variety.
There's gore all over the place here, which must have made the R-rating a close call.  There are decaptitations, throat-rippings, stakes through the heart, limbs ripped off, and exploding bodies.  The make-up effects are good (and sometimes noticable campy) but the CGI-rendered effects are weak, even for a movie that isn't meant to be taken very seriously.  Thankfully, there aren't as many of those here as the traditional make-up effects (vice-versa was the case for Blade, which was terrible).To satisfy the male crowd, a fair share of nudity is inserted, though none of it is particularly titillating.  Most people I know, though, have found Salma Hayek's dance sequence to be a highlight.  I'll admit, it's a little sexy in a seedy manner, and she plays the scene perfectly.  Hayek isn't in the film all that much, but her attractive presence is a plus, it certainly adds to the experience.  When it comes to vampire seductresses, she's not as memorable as Mathilda May was in Lifeforce, but she's still eerie and sexy here.As much as it is an action/horror film, From Dusk Till Dawn is also a comedy, and a very dark one at that.  For the first hour, it's mostly the same style of humor seen in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Once the vampires appear, the laughs come from some sharp jabs at horror cliches (the sharp dialogue is till there).  Despite the humor, there's still some genuine tension, particularly a scene where one of the massacre's survivors turns into a vampire and attacks the others, as well as Keitel's slow walk to the back room as he tries to hold off dozens of vampires with a shotgun.
The film is also boosted from some fun performances.  Nobody's aiming for an Oscar here, but George Clooney is quite effective as the anti-hero who wields his guns in near desperado-style, and Quentin Tarantino is a riot as his insane brother.  Harvey Keitel is his typically solid self, and plays the part of a preacher who has lost his faith well, bringing some dignity into the movie.  Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu are adequate for a movie like this.  Cheech Marin's got three roles and chews the scenery big time.The film's most interesting character belongs to make-up man Tom Savini. Fred Williamson tries to be as odd and quirky, but Savini's biker character Sex Machine is hilarious and memorable.  Horror fans may know him mostly for his great make-up effects, but this performance is a scene-stealer.  This isn't exactly a great performance (nor is he aiming for that), but it's a remarkably enthusiastic one.By the end, you'll realize that From Dusk Till Dawn is hardly a great film. But it accomplishes its intent, delivering thrills and action in spades, as well as some good laughs.  Two sequels have been made, and I keep hearing the second one is terrible while the third is pretty good.  Vampire films have never been my cup of tea, but damned if this one didn't have me entertained.",Null,24,48,9 August 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Pulse-pounding action entertainment.
","*** 1/2 stars out of ****Mission: Impossible 2 is a rare sequel that surpasses the original, which was a bit too complex for its own good.  This time around, with director John Woo at the helm, Tom Cruise back, and Robert Towne writing the script, the sequel is considerably easier to understand in terms of story, and the action scenes are some of the wildest and best in years.The story doesn't really matter that much in a film like this.  It's basically James Bond over again, this time with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out to stop former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his henchmen from stealing Chimera, a deadly man-made virus that kills in less than 2 days. To penetrate Ambrose's security, Hunt hesitantly brings in thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to work her charms over Ambrose; she was also his former lover.But not everything goes according to plan, and Ambrose discovers Nyah's real purposes for coming back to him and plans to kill her, but she injects herself with the last strain of the virus.  With 20 hours left, Hunt must retrieve Bellerophon, the virus's only cure, and stop Ambrose from delivering the virus over the world.M:I2 is entirely different in style from its predecessor.  It works as pure action entertainment, and it's all the better for it.  Though it doesn't bring in fight after fight from the beginning, it's never dull, with charismatic performances, great direction as usual from John Woo, and some lovely cinematography.Woo's usual over-the-top style is here, with a little more restraint in terms of blood and gore, but there's no mistaking his touch in the film. His trademarks are here, and as strong as ever.  This film is easily better than the last several Bond movies.  After an entertaining set up, the last 40 minutes are packed with non-stop action, with Woo turning in amazing set piece after set piece.  Whether it's a chaotic shootout in a secret lab, a long motorcycle chase that features a barage of breathtaking stunts (one of Woo's all-time best action scenes, a real compliment), or a climactic martial arts duel on a beach, the last 1/3 of the film don't disappoint if its action you're looking for.The performances are solid for a film of this genre.  Tom Cruise simply exudes coolness as superspy Ethan Hunt, who is truly becoming an even more compelling hero than James Bond.  Thandie Newton is relatively decent as the love interest, though she's a little nonexistent in the last half hour due to the non-stop action.  Ving Rhames gets some good lines in, providing comic relief along with some action muscle.  Dougray Scott is all right as the villain.  We don't really hate him as much as we should, but he does the physical parts of the role quite well.There are a lot of other little elements that work in M:I2.  Hans Zimmer composes another strong score, which reminds a tad of his own work in Gladiator.  The special effects are brilliantly done, the settings are exotic, and everybody involved seems to be enjoying themselves. A can't miss film if you love action.",10,1,2,10 December 2000
Total Recall," More dull than you would expect from Schwarzenegger.
","* and 1/2 stars out of ****I like Arnold Schwarzenegger and his movies.  He may never win an Oscar, but he knows how to crank out entertaining cinema, with thrilling action films like the Terminator movies, True Lies, and even End of Days.  I, however do not like director Paul Verhoeven, who has the tendency to take good ideas and screw them up.  Total Recall is a film full of intriguing, and even marvelous, ideas.  It's only unfortunate that nothing too significant is done with these ideas.Memories.  It's an intriguing concept because it seems to define who we are. Without them, we just wouldn't be ourselves.  This is the backdrop of Total Recall, which is probably a far better setup than the film deserves. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who lives a seemingly happy life far in the future.  He has a lovely wife (Sharon Stone) and a good home.But, lately, he's been having dreams about a dark-haired woman (Rachel Ticotin), with the both of them on the planet Mars, which is currently turmoil because of a megalomaniac (Ronny Cox).  Then, Quaid decides to go to Rekall, Inc., a company that lets you experience a fantasy world.  His recent dreams have compelled him to go through with this fanatasy.  But just as he's about to begin the 'vacation', something goes wrong and he's thrown out of the building.More problems begin to occur as everybody Quaid knows seems to be after him, even his wife.  He eventually begins to believe that all his memories are false, and his search for his true identity leads him to Mars and the dark-haired woman of his dreams.Yes, the plot sounds interesting, and the added mercenaries that are after him seem like it would give them a pace that speeds along, but it really doesn't.  After a very absorbing first half hour, everything starts to go downhill from there.  The action scenes simply aren't exciting, just gory and gruesome, something typical of Verhoeven.  Sometimes, the choreography can even get downright laughable.  Thinking of that, I am reminded of the endless kicks to the crotch that Stone delivers to Schwarzenegger, which looks more goofy than anything else.  Now, Verhoeven can direct superb action scenes (i.e. Starship Troopers) but his work here is rather lackluster, as is his handling with the script.The reasons behind the lack of excitement could lie in the fact that Schwarzenegger never really seems all that scared.  He initially tries that, but as soon as the film sets on Mars, he acts very cocky, like he could take on anybody.  His reaction to what's going on around is far from believable, and it might actually have been a better idea to bring somebody in less physically imposing (which reminds me of the upcoming film Impostor, which sounds similar in plot and stars the splendid Gary Sinise, a perfect actor for the role needed).The worst part is, there's an unpredictable plot twist that seems to pop up every half hour that perks your interest up and leads you to believe the film will get better.  It doesn't.  After the momentary jolt of surprise (I did really enjoy the last twist, which is quite shocking), everything falls back down to Earth (or is it Mars?), and the boredom sets in again.The set design and special effects can be impressive, but everything starts to look hazy and unpleasant after a while.  I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it could be the choice of color shades the director chose to shoot the film with. The performances don't really amount to much of anything.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays himself again, but a little less convincingly than usual.  Sharon Stone is sexy and seductive as Quaid's deadly wife, but she's not given much more to do other than shout, show cleavage, and kick Scwarzenegger around.  Rachel Ticotin is simply awful, and I would have prefered if her role had been switched around with Stone.Mars is a fascinating planet that always looks like it's harboring some sort of secret.  Total Recall has that element in its script, but it doesn't do anything significant with it.  As a matter of fact, just slight changes around and I don't think this film would even need the Mars setting.  As it is, the best film about this red planet is still Brian De Palma's underrated Mission to Mars.",1,21,49,18 November 2000
Braveheart," One of the best films ever made.
","**** out of ****Braveheart is a magnificent historical epic, easily the best film of its kind, one that features bloody and brutal battle sequences, but also adds an immense amount of depth, passion, and human interest into the wonderful story.Taking place in Scotland in the 1300's, Braveheart is the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a Scotsman who wishes only for peace after the deaths of his father and brother in a rebellion when he was only a boy.  His Uncle Argyle becomes his caretaker, as well as his teacher and mentor.Wallace eventually returns home to the love of his life, Murron (Catherine McCormack), and marries her in secret, due to the new British law that all newlywed women must be bedded with an English lord. But tragedy ensues, when Murron is killed for assaulting a British officer trying to rape her.With vengeance and passion for freedom from tyranny in his heart, Wallace stages a rebellion against Edward the Longshanks, the King of England.  He's aided by the help of old friends, countless villagers and highlanders, and the Princess of France, Isabelle (Sophie Marceau), and romance and strong feelings begin to develop between she and Wallace, who continues to fight for Scotland's freedom.In only his sophomore effort as director, Mel Gibson weaves together a fantastic film, one that is complete in every and works on every level.  The movie is most famous for its bloody battle sequences, which are indeed brutal and perhaps the best of its kind ever filmed.  Despite the brutality, the violence is never glorified in any manner.  War is truly ugly, and bloodshed is always a result.Braveheart features a stunning cast, mostly of actors whom are unknown, but are very memorable in their roles.  Of course, top acting honors must go to Mel Gibson, whose portrayal of William Wallace is powerful and brilliant (plus, the accent sounds genuine) and the fact that he did not even receive a nomination for his performance goes only further to prove how unfair the Academy can be.  Patrick Mcgoohan is appropriately cold and callous as the King of England, a character whom we truly grow to fear and despise.  Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack, two supremely beautiful and talented actresses, are great in their roles as the women in Wallace's life.  Though McCormack has only a half-hour or so of screen time, her character remains long within you.On the technical side, everything is marvelously executed.  The cinematography is lush and beautiful, the sets are very convincing, and the musical score from James Horner is perhaps his best ever, a real compliment, considering the fact he also scored Titanic and Glory.At 177 minutes, Braveheart's pace never lags for one moment, as it always mesmerizes and compels you.  Credit this to the work of so many people (most particularly Gibson), who have put together a cinematic masterpiece.  This is one motion picture experience that is a must for any moviegoer.",10,1,2,12 January 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Maybe my all-time favorite action film.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** **** out of ****Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features the most action, adventure, comedy, and character development in the series.  Does this make it the best in the series?  In my book, I suppose so (it's been a while since I've seen Raiders).  In any case, The Last Crusade is a superb, fast-paced, non-stop thrill ride that's more fun than any rollercoaster ride I've ridden.  This film definitely has its heart set in the old days of Saturday Matinee Serials, and if you just don't get any enjoyment out of this movie, I feel sorry for you.For the third-go-round, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, who else?) has been hired by myterious benefactor, Donovan, to continue the search for the lost cup of Christ, the Holy Grail.  Indy is reluctant at first, but when he discovers his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), led the first expedition and disappeared, he agrees.  Teaming up with Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) and the beautiful Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), they proceed to figure out the riddle of the numbers in the library, which leads to the completion of seal on the knight's tomb (if this sounds complex, don't worry, it really isn't).Now on the search for both the Grail and his father, Indy discovers traitors among his midst and can only rely on his old friends, including Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).  Captured by the Nazis, who are also searching for the Grail, he finds his father.  Together, they escape and it becomes a race against time to reach the secret location of the Grail before the Nazis get their hands on it.It was probably pointless for me to describe the plot since almost everyone has seen this movie.  Yes, I realize a lot of people will probably call me crazy for considering this the best in the trilogy, but for me, it simply felt more adventurous and fun the original (don't get me wrong, Raiders is a VERY close second to this).  It's lighter-hearted than the other films in the series and it's one gross-out scene (all three have got one) is considerably less bloody than the others.I've always considered Steven Spielberg cinema's best action director (if not the overall best director), and he proved himself in true superb fashion in The Last Crusade, directing some marvelous setpieces.  The train sequence is a great touch and is among my favorite chase scenes.  The motorcycle is chase is also a lot of fun, and the climactic tank chase (boy, we've got a lot of chases going on) is a true standout.Humor is what separates it apart from Raiders and Temple of Doom.  Now, both those movies had their fair share of great comedy, but The Last Crusade is absolutely hilarious, and all the better for it.  Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have absolutely brilliant chemistry together, with most of the laughs coming from their retorts to one another.  Credit should also be given to the late Jeffrey Boam's script, which is witty and smart.  He simply knew what the audience wanted, and delivered.Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, of course, and he was born to play the man. Nobody else would have fit the role and, once again, the movie is mostly his (he's gotta bump aside just a bit for Connery and company).  Just as terrific is Connery as the not-so-affectionate father who has no idea how to tell his feelings to his son.  Their interaction plays off very well, and Spielberg wisely never gives in to any maudlin sentimentality.  Trust me, that one scene where Henry Jones thinks his son is dead is played more for laughs than anything else.The supporting cast is a lot of fun, too.  Denholm Elliot, who didn't seem quite this goofy in Raiders, is very funny and likable as the somewhat clumsy Marcus Brody.  John Rhys-Davies is equally good and fun to watch as the jovial Sallah.  These four are the good guys, and unlike most films, they steal every scene they're in, never giving in to whatever performances the 'villains' deliver.These villains are played by Julian Glover and Alison Doody.  Glover is appropriately snaky and easy to hiss at as the traitorous Donovan.  Doody is the third Jones girl, and she's easily the best-looking and least annoying, which makes it a small pity she plays a not-so-nice girl.There's been plenty of speculation on a fourth Indiana Jones film, but I don't see it happening.  Ford has aged too much, same with Connery, and I don't believe I would really be that interested to see Costner as Indy's brother, fun as it may sound.  But it may be better that the series ends this way, on such a high note.  The Last Crusade pretty much has all action/adventure fans are looking for and more:  Great action, great characters, great locations, and a lot of fun.  That's why this is one of my favorites.",10,1,1,10 July 2001
Jurassic Park," One of the finest examples of escapist entertainment.
","**** out of ****Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking (in terms of visuals, not plot) sci-fi action/thriller, may not have the everlasting historical and human importance of Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but damn if it doesn't thrill me every time I see it.  This is the film that finally proved to me that Spielberg could do anything when it comes to action and adventure (beforehand, he had the Indiana Jones films).  It's a movie that just about everyone has heard of seen by now, and it's impact is still felt now, so many years later.Upon it's initial release I noticed nothing good reviews for the film, but I've always noticed comments and slight criticism about the lack of character development.  I'm still at a loss about all those complaints. First of all, while it might not have quite as much characterization as Spieblerg's Jaws (I actually prefer JP just a tad over that film), it's certainly far more than you'd expect from the typical summber blockbuster. I can say with ease I found the cast and characters likable and engaging, particularly Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Bob Peck. This is the movie that made Neill a recognizable figure worldwide.  Before this, he'd proven his thespian talents in the thriller Dead Calm, but had never been in something as high-profile as this.  I give kudos to Spielberg for not trying to put some mega-star in the lead, but instead chose to go with Neill, who has yet to deliver anything below a fine performance.  To this day, Neill remains among my favorite actors, and it was great to see him back in Jurassic Park 3.Laura Dern hasn't quite had as much attention since then, but is still solid in anything she does.  It was quite good to see her in JP3 and her scenes with Neill in that respective film brought back some of the well-done sentimental feeling that Spielberg used effectively in this film.  Jeff Goldblum is very funny as Ian Malcolm and would continue to be humorous in The Lost World, and Bob Peck is quite a standout as the park's game warden who understands the danger of the situation better than anyone else. Richard Attenborough is also good as the park's owner, and it's nice to see that he's not portrayed as a megalomaniac, as is what we usually see in most 'science runs amok' thrillers.But, of course, nobody watched this movie for the performances.  It was all on the basis of the special effects and the action.  Both are spectacular and exciting, to say the least.  Stan Winston's animatronic effects are the best, creating dinosaurs so lifelike, you'd swear it had be the real thing. Michael Lantieri and Phil Tippett set up a new stage of CGI as their work on this film was unlike anything anybody had ever seen before.  There are even moments when it's hard to tell which dino is an animatronic or CGI-rendered product.As I've said before, I've always considered Steven Spielberg not only one of cinema's greatest filmmakers, but also the best action director ever. Whether it's rollicking adventure with Indiana Jones or brilliantly tense and harrowing battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan, he never fails to generate thrills and excitement.  Jurassic Park is a further testament to his skill.  The dino attacks are nail-biters, especially a scene with two raptors inside a kitchen that's among the film's best setpieces.  The t-rex also never fails to get a chill out of me.  I have two particular favorite moments.  The first is the t-rex attack on the two electric cars, which jumpstarts the movie's thrill ride mode.  The other is the extended raptor chase, all the way from the kitchen to the computer room to the museum.  A very tense and long sequence that caps off with a fun showdown between 3 dinosaurs.Most summer blockbusters have this certain rule that a movie should run over two hours, thus making it an event movie, but a lot of them have the tendency to run out of steam well before they reach that mark.  Jurassic Park runs at 127 minutes, but is never dull for single moment.  Spielberg paces the film perfectly, building up momentum and paying off with great action and suspense.David Koepp's script is a bit different than Michael Crichton's novel, and while I did enjoy the book immensely, I'm rather glad Spielberg's version wasn't quite in the same vein with Crichton, perhaps because certain aspects of it seemed a little too violent and too far out-of-tone.  From what I've read, Crichton's script was ultra-violent and some of the characters were downright unpleasant (similar to the book, but would feel a heck of a lot different on-screen).Another constant complaint, perhaps, is the sentimentalism Spielberg brings to the film, mostly the addition of Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as the two children under Neill's care as they're lost in the park.  Hmm, aside from the fact that it didn't bother me in the least and that all they're scenes are handled quite well, both child actors are quite talented. Besides, these scenes actually make their characters even more engaging and likable.Adding immensely to the overall experience of the film is John Williams' score.  To say this is one of his best would be a huge statement, but it is easily one of his better scores.  Whether it's creating wonder or tension, Williams hits all the right notes.  There's no doubting this is one of the more popular scores around, and considering Williams' resume, it's no surprise.Jurassic Park has been compared to Jaws many times and it's usually deemed inferior, but I slightly prefer this film.  Both are thrill rides that will never be equaled to be sure, but Jurassic Park adds a sense of awe and wonder that brings it up a notch.  I suppose it wouldn't be outright scary as Jaws, seeing how it is sharks do exist and dinosaurs have been dead for a while, but it's still got its own good scares.There have been 3 films released in the series and I'm sure another will be coming up in the next couple of years.  Jurassic Park still easily remains the best, but its sequels are nonetheless very entertaining and enjoyable. I'm still waiting for Spielberg's next non-sequel thrill ride, and it will take quite a bit of effort to match this one.",Null,0,1,2 August 2001
