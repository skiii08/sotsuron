The Legend of Bagger Vance," EXCELLED IN EXCELLENCE
","I was totally mesmerized with this movie from the beginning until the end. I delayed watching this movie for a long time thinking it was of little value and presumably extremely boring. Boy was I wrong. Robert Redford not only directed a masterpiece, I believe he got the most out of his actors- especially the primary ones. I was totally impressed with Will Smith's role. I was expecting a Step-Fetchit character (one of the reasons why I put off viewing the movie for so long) but the writer and director gave Smith's character substance. The Legend of Bagger Vance was worth watching and now I'm willing to add it to my video library. This movie definitely leaves you with a good feeling and though two hours long, I certainly didn't notice it.I highly recommend it for all. It gets a 10/10.",10,0,1,7 March 2002
The Ring," OVERBLOWN, OVERRATED HYPE
","I just viewed The Ring at the local $2.00 theatre and I'm glad I didn't spend any extra money.  Who said this movie was good? 
This movie, starring Naomi Watts as Rachel, Martin Henderson as Noah and David Dorfman as Aidan has little suspense, horror or thrills.  The movie begins with Katie (Amber Tamblyn), the neice of Rachel, and Becca (Rachael Bella) sharing information about a tape that, if watched, claims you will die within seven days. Surprisingly enough, the rumor is spreading amongst the high school crowd (courtesy of Becca and others). 
Katie, along with three of her friends rendezvous at a cabin retreat and view a non-commercial VHS tape of mixed messages and images.  From what I've gathered (unless I missed some crucial dialog), this rumor was amassed without anyone actually dying.  How many VHS tapes of The Ring actually exist?  If the Katie and her friends weren't the only viewers, when did other viewers die where a rumor (or facts) could be built?  If the only available copy existed at the cabin retreat, how did Becca find out about it and share the rumor with Katie who actually saw the tape and, no doubt, received the phone call that vocalized her future demise?  If symptons developed after viewing the tape, such as a bleeding nose, or a blurred face in a photograph, wouldn't Katie have noticed these things prior to her 7th day and shared the information with Becca?  I could go on with the unanswered questions, but I need to redirect my energy.Dreamworks, this is what I call good promoting.  It's an overblown production that produces below average results.Thrills, suspense and horror?  Give me the first two Alien movies. In fact, Deep Rising was a better horror movie than The Ring and it's current rating is averaging a full 2 points less; and Deep Rising had clever humor where The Ring failed.I hope they don't produce a sequel because this was garbage. In fact, please don't.  2 out of 10 because I did jump during the millipede scene.  But, I'd jump even if the millipede scene was intermixed in a comedy because I don't like bugs.",2,0,0,2 February 2003
Jerry Maguire," Excellence in Filmmaking
","This movie had me laughing; crying; smiling; staring; anticipating; everything.  When I viewed the voter history for this movie, I couldn't believe the rating it had received after 13,400 registered users had voted. This movie was excellent from the direction to the production sets.  The acting was superb by all but could not and would not have been as great if it had not been for the vision of the director.  I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it everywhere.  The scenes, the sequences, the editing were all great.  Though I'm not involved in the movie industry yet, I try to observe details in a production that make a good, bad, or great movie.  In this case everything fell into place.  The music for certain scenes was perfect.  The characters were extremely believable.  Everyone in the lead and supporting roles deserve an award of some type.  I'm a 49 year old male with two grown kids and two grandchildren but I'm not ashamed to say I was filled with emotion as I watched this film.  I believe a film should consume the viewer- to me that's great filmmaking.  If I can leave my seat or carry on a conversation while watching a film, it's not great- it might be good, but not great.  Jerry Maguire had my undivided attention.  Kudos to everyone involved in the production of this movie.  I waited four years to see this movie which I finally purchased on VHS cassette two or three months ago.  It was a worthy investment and I will soon purchase it on DVD.  Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!",10,20,38,4 September 2000
Enemy at the Gates," EXCELLENT
","I enjoyed every moment of this movie from the opening scene until the very end.  The suspense and tension was great and the atmosphere of the war was forever present throughout the film.  I felt like I was there as I shared the various locations with the snipers- feeling the cold; laying on the ground, rocks and stubble and waiting anxiously.I also felt I've seen the best fully clothed love scene in my entire life.This movie brought to mind the old Sam Peckinpah war thriller Cross of Iron where the Russians were pitted against the Germans.  In summary, another testament to the courage of the men, women and children that battle the invaders of their land and their willingness to die for what they believe in- the salvation of their country.I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it.",10,0,2,18 July 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," What's So Funny?
","I rented this movie because of the commercial trailers and the suggestions of others but watching it was excruciating! The dialog was weak and Will and Christina had no chemistry with one another. There wasn't one scene or line that stayed with me. Okay, one scene where Christina's character beat up Will, but no lines were funny enough become repeatable in casual conversation. I think it's been grossly overrated and I honestly thought, after watching it, that I had rented the straight-to-video version, 'Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie'. I had to check IMDb to verify I had the original theatrical release. I wouldn't and couldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Boring and unfunny. Want to enjoy Will Ferrell at his best? See 'Old School'.",1,10,23,30 July 2005
Apollo 13," Very good!
","Definitely a very entertaining movie and I recommend it.  Although I'm unfamiliar with the full details of the Apollo 13 facts, the way they presented them in this movie through the various scenes, made it believable and got me emotionally involved with the crew's dilemma. 
This movie was filled with Hollywood's superstars and they played their parts well- even the children of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks).  Ron Howard caught the interactions between the performers in the important scenes so you could feel the situations.  You get caught up in the efforts the space shuttle crew and Mission Control make to get the Apollo 13 back to earth.A hearty high five to not only the actors and actresses that portrayed the real-life characters, but a hearty high five to the real spoken and unspoken heros of the Apollo 13 mission as well.",8,0,0,14 September 2000
