The Lobster," To lie or to die
","It is a debate wheather we keep our conciousness or we will totally separate ourselves from the feelings, the common sense and the from the rights of life. Unique picture of human struggles whether to fight againts the body to win the human nature or to lie constantly about even every single detail. Very wide perspective of absurd and in the same time the film leaves an audience with a slight hope for normality.",8,1,3,14 March 2018
