Walk the Line," Acting Cinematography Directing - Superb
","This was an excellent film. I've never been a Johnny Cash fan, nor do I listen to that kind of music. But a friend said it was a great movie, so I rented the DVD. Now I wish I'd seen it in the theater! Fantastic cinematography, and actually great music too. But here's the deal....As far as actors go, Phoenix & Witherspoon are amazing to watch in this movie. I'm fascinated by great actors as it is, but these two unleash some serious SERIOUS talent in this film. There are a few films I can watch just for the acting alone - Training Day (Denzel Washington & Ethan Hawke), Gladiator (Phoenix, Russ Crowe) for example... and now this film, Walk the Line, I add to the list due to Phoenix and Witherspoon's performances. Great story too, and well directed. You won't be disappointed, even if you've never heard of Johnny Cash.",10,1,2,26 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Can you say EPIC ?
","Epic Fun. I give a '9' simply because I would have handled the 'flying sail parachute' scene a little bit differently. I won't give a spoiler here, don't worry. GREAT movie. Go see it. Now. GO.I don't have anything more to say about this film but I have to continue to type because for some bizarre reason, I'm not allowed to make a simple 2 or 3 line comment. IMDb demands at least 10 lines, so now I'm trying to fill space so my comment will be accepted. So I think I'm getting close to line 10 now -- therefore after this sentence I'll stop typing. Oops...still didn't take, so I'll now type 1 more line of ridiculous text to meet the all-important 10-line minimum. Please change your policy, IMDb.",9,1,2,26 May 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Great ! -- but shaking camera overused.
","Great movie, very entertaining and great ending....but geeezz... I had a headache 5 minutes into the film! Every scene- regardless of mood - was shot with an excessive amount of 'shake, vibrate, move, quick-pan, zoom-in, zoom-out, etc' technique. :( good grief!The following is very 'opinionated' and subjective I suppose... I like the use of these techniques(shaking/zooming/partially obscuring subjects with foreground objects or people) in films like Babel or Saving Private Ryan, but this one went way way overboard with it and hence the effectiveness (of the camera) is quickly destroyed, because there's no visual dynamic to contrast dramatic to subdued scenes. Its great stuff at times, but I shouldn't have to guess at what MIGHT be happening in the fight scenes, and sort of make up my own version as it plays out in front of me... 'ok, I guess there he twisted his arm and, wow! that must have been a kick or something...and oh dude! what happened then? I guess maybe he stabbed him or something'. And I shouldn't have to wonder 'why is the camera shaking, jerking, zooming, panning left/right during this subdued scene with regular conversation between 2 people??' Music varies with scenes to convey the intended mood, right?... Well, if there's no effort to vary the cinematography techniques to convey the mood of individual scenes, isn't that like painting a picture of a grassy field against a sunset and using red for the grass and red for the sun and red for the sky? ...imho. I don't know - some people might like it constantly shaking with no attention to 'composition' (in its classic sense) and no slow steady dramatic pans- but I need a little break from the jerky movement occasionally.Great film otherwise... great ending too.",8,1,3,3 August 2007
Million Dollar Baby," WoW - blown away
","Great, great movie demonstrating that Clint Eastwood understands cinematography and directing like no (or few) others. Go see it. Now. Go. --- you still here??? GOOO!

Avatar," anti USA :(
","Well - I was real excited about seeing this one...that is, until I saw the preview trailer about 5 mins ago. So I'm going to write a pre-judgement, and then go see it to see if I have to eat my words. OK?- here's my prediction: We've all seen this plot 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times. Guy has mission. Guy falls for girl on enemy side. Girl complicates & compromises mission, and guy questions / doubts his mission. etc. Blah- I'm tired of it. Secondly- By the reviews I'm reading, it seems most people will swallow the anti-American message of the film as long as the eye candy 'tastes' good. Isn't the US being portrayed as a 'raper' of foreign-owned resources ? (or maybe there were some Nazi SS patches on their sleeves that I didn't notice... But gee those accents sounded American to me).OK - there's my pre-judgement based on the short trailer. I'll go see it and do a post-review and eat my words if I'm wrong. ps> the music in the trailer is beyond cliché. I'm pretty sure I've heard it in car commercials.** UPDATE ** DEC. 22: OK, I've been around the internet looking at various opinion posts from sites are *aren't* promoting the movie (which generally means they're more honest), and the general consensus is that the movie's story & general 'message' is cliché & blah. Visual fx is the only thing I hear that's good. So I still haven't seen the movie, but I'll see soon and post whether or not I agree. But since so much effort was made on visual realism, I'm going to bump my original rating up 1 notch.",10,24,121,19 December 2009
The Departed," Worth Seeing for DiCaprio's acting alone. Pretty amazing.
","Double infiltration -- interesting movie. DiCaprio & Nicholson are amazing actors, no doubt. I give it a 7, because there are places that could have been much better directed in the telling of the story, but it was pretty killer overall - except for the fact that it leaves you feeling depressed instead of hopeful. Also- I left the theater right when they shot DiCaprio and the whole theater gasps in disbelief... I thought to myself: 'yep- yet again the good guy, the glimmer of hope in all of this corruption get's wacked...in typical 'new Hollywood' style; it seems they like to have 'evil' triumph now-a-days. (I wish I'd stayed to see Walberg get Damon, but it didn't matter at that point, because a typical viewer is naturally pulling for DiCaprio to overcome the enormous dangers he's in and expose the bad guys. So when he get's shot - its like 'crap- that sux - i'm outta here.') Oh well - I'll have to counter the psychological fx by watching a good indie film. lol . Enjoy -",7,0,1,15 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Wow. This year's Best
","You can pretty much rest assured that those placing poor reviews of this film, are simply 'following orders' from the 'attack-Tom-Cruise- for-speaking-his-opinion-on-the-drug-industry' crowd.It is a fantastic film. Chilling. Intense. Epic. Visually stunning, and I have not had this much fun at a theater in years. After having seen both originals (made in the 70's) - the European version, and the American version - you'd think, since I knew what was coming I wouldn't be on the edge of my seat. Well...I was on the edge of my seat many times thru-out this movie. Well directed, well acted, and true to the original story. Its great. Go see it.",10,1,6,1 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," GREAT-depressing-Stunning visually
","I'm updating my first post because I saw the movie AGAIN, and now have different view of it. The first time I saw it was 12 midnight and I was very tired with a headache too. So I saw it again the next day, fully rested, feeling good, and now can give a fair assessment of it. Acting is fine in this film with the exception of Portman in 1 or 2 scenes, and Jackson in a few scenes. Portman is weak with her 'oh Anikin - let's go somewhere where its just you and me and our love' bs. Jackson isn't 'official' and 'military' enough in his demeanor and presence. He struts when he walks. No disciplined use of the English language- casual and lax in word pronunciations. It doesn't seem appropriate for the military 'flavor' of 'Jedi-status' individuals. He and Portman are A-list, fine actors who are fantastic in other roles but not in these. We all know this is the story of the fall, so I wasn't expecting a happy ending. However, Lucas chose to end this thing with a scene that I thought was absolutely FANTASTIC. In the first movie, there is a scene (which I won't reveal) which became a sort of Landmark for its emotion, power, and uniqueness at the time. I thought that I was the only one who really loved this scene and remembered it. But Lucas, obviously recognized it as well and it was a fantastic way to end this movie. That being said... My problem with the film: I personally don't think we're given proper motivation for Anikin to fall to the dark side. If Lucas had shown slight clues of instable character, betrayal tendencies, or character flaws inclined towards evil previous to this movie, then this fall would have been more believable, as this sort of 'hidden' but dark side started to grow. When Anikin falls to evil, it is so tragically depressingly unbelievable that I simply wanted to walk out of the theater; I mean - there was no well-developed REASON for him so suddenly turn to evil, I was like- so 'what's up wid dat'!?? Regarding endless fight scenes, Its a time of war; there's going to be much fighting. Deal with it. Just don't go to the movie tired with a headache; it'll wear you down fast if you do.",7,4,7,19 May 2005
