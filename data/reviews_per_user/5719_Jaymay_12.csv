Casablanca," HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE
","There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don't disagree with them.But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that 'Romantic Touch.'  Don't watch it as part of your 'I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time' Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, 'Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.'  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.
If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no 'hype,' you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing, kid.",10,314,339,23 August 2003
Billy Elliot," possible best picture nominee
","This is a fantastic movie.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it among the Best Picture nominees for this year as a small sentimental favorite, the way The Full Monty made it in a couple years ago.  Jamie Bell gives a great performance, and after this movie he'll probably be more popular than Prince William in the UK.This is a sweet little movie, and you have to give it the benefit of the doubt in its more melodramatic moments, but it's a wonderful portrait of a young artist emerging from family and social turmoil.  A great example of the worst thing in the world--a boy doing ballet!--turning out to be not just a good thing, but perhaps the salvation of a family's spirit.With CROUPIER, GIRL ON A BRIDGE, and now BILLY ELLIOT, I'd have to say it's been a heck of a year for European movies.",Null,0,0,26 September 2000
Grease," Hey Putsie...15 minutes
","GREASE was on AMC tonight and I happened to catch it.This movie is so great. There's no pretension to it. It is really hard to make a movie musical that isn't pretentious and uppity. Has anyone watched 'Chicago' lately, even though it got all those Oscar noms? Yeah, I thought not.Sure, everyone's seen the movie. But here are a few facts about it you might not know.The original Broadway production was a hit, but the music was REALLY hokey and many of the songs were different.Can you imagine a movie musical being made today from a musical where new songs are added that are BETTER than the originals? Grease (the opener), Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted and You're the One That I Want are all new for the movie, and all are now classics.It's fun to watch the Pink Ladies scenes knowing that Stockard Channing was 33 and Dinah Manot, who played Marty, was only 18 when the movie was being filmed.(Side note -- if you haven't seen Dinah Manot in Ordinary People, watch it -- you'll be amazed at what a good actress she was).Another interesting cast note: the woman who played Jan (brusha brusha brusha) basically was in this movie and that's it except for like three tiny cameo roles in other films. How's that for a film career -- one movie and it's one of the biggest hits of all time! Not bad!When you talk about the movie version of Grease, you have to talk about Travolta. Seeing the bloated, bad actor that he's become, you have to go back and watch this movie to realize that this guy is one of the most talented all-around comedians who ever hit a screen. He can sing, he can dance, he's funny as hell, and he has a style all his own. I dare you to find a young actor today who pops off a screen as much as Travolta did. Unbelievable.The thing I love most about Grease is that it was such an underdog as a project.Helmed by a 31 year old TV director Randal Kleiser (who was George Lucas's roommate at USC, and apparently wrote his own IMDb biography, so maybe he'll read this and correct my mistakes), Paramount didn't expect much out of this movie, and they kind of left the young cast and director to do their thing. There's a fast-and-looseness to the movie, an almost improvisational feel at times, yet the comic timing is always DEAD ON.This is a movie that respects comedy. Sid Caesar, Eve Arden -- these are giants of comedy that were at a career ebb around 1977, and the director shouldn't have been able to get them, but he did, and they make the movie hugely better.But it's all about the young cast. You can tell that this is a group of actors that really felt like friends and were just having a good time. You've got actors in their late 20s and early 30s playing high schoolers, but somehow it's the best of both worlds -- there's plenty of sophomoric humor, but when Stockard C. sings 'There are worse things,' she gives it a depth Christina Aguilera never could . You've got actors like Jeff Conaway who never really did anything even close to good after this but he's brilliant as Kenickie. You've got a screenplay written by some woman I've never heard of who, once again, dropped off the face of the earth after this movie -- but how many classic lines are in this movie?! It's just amazing.I salute every one who was a part of Grease. I loved it as a little kid and I still love it today.JM",10,1,3,4 September 2004
Sing Street," Against all odds, John Carney does it again
","I'm a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.My fears were unfounded.SING STREET is a heartfelt, funny and artful coming-of-age movie set in 1985 Dublin. I'm close to an ideal audience member for this film, because I grew up in the 80s myself, a child of the MTV Generation. I count John Hughes' films and the Cameron-Crowe scripted Fast Times At Ridgemont High among the most influential films of my childhood. They are the reason I became a screenwriter, and why I continue to write movies for a teen audience.Sing Street truly hearkens back to those great teen movies of the 80s. The best stories about teenagers are rooted in pain and isolation, and this is no different - Connor 'Cosmo' Lawler comes from an upper middle class family that has fallen on hard times. His parents have constant fights. His older brother Brendan is a college dropout and his sister, the 'smart one,' pretty much keeps to herself. In order for the family to save money, Connor is transferred to the local Catholic boys school, where he's quickly made an outcast and an example by the authoritarian headmaster.You could say that this is a movie about forming a band. And this genre of story - of artistic awakening - seems to be replayed quite often in British and Irish films like The Commitments, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, and others. But those movies each had a unique wrinkle, and Sing Street does too. It's the beautifully told story of the way that the inspiration and inception of the best art is rarely an individual act of genius, but rather, the result of a series of interconnected acts of human desire and emotion.It's the parents who sentence you to a horrible school; the girl who you long for that won't give you the time of day; the other guys who join your band because they're outcasts too... the brother who loves you too much, and is too angry at his own cowardice, to let you settle for less than your best.There's also a lot of great humor in Sing Street about the fact that you have to try on the styles of your heroes before you find your own confidence. 40-something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. The art direction and costumes are done wonderfully in that respect. But I think this movie will work wonderful for today's teenagers as well.The movie is by turns funny, heart-wrenching, soaring and surprising. And the musical numbers, while not necessarily Oscar winning, like Once, is great. I'm thrilled that a new generation of teenagers will get to experience the release of a movie that's on par with the films I love so much as a kid.",9,96,124,16 March 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," An absolute abomination
","This is not the only awful film to be made from a children's book in the last few years: Lemony Snicket and Cat in the Hat spring to mind, and certainly, the Harry Potter movies are never much better than mediocre.But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory suffers from the fact that it must be compared to the Gene Wilder version, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is not only superior to it in every way, but is truly a classic film.One might well ask why anyone would dare to remake a film that was written by Roald Dahl himself. A film that had beautiful, classic songs, biting humor, and a hilarious cast.The answer, of course, is money.This film was made for one reason -- to wring more money out of a Warner Brothers property. Why else remake a nearly perfect film? It's an insult to moviegoers and an affront to the many children who may never bother to watch the original now that they've seen this trash.The thing is, the Gene Wilder version is very, very funny. Its comedy still seems edgy today. And somehow, they've managed to turn it into a movie with almost no laughs. The timing is sometimes, it seems, deliberately thrown off.Johnny Depp's performance is, I think, his worst ever. It's just stupendously bad. Then again, he has basically nothing to work with, caught between plain, unfunny new dialogue, and struggling to go in the opposite direction from Gene Wilder's brilliance. I don't envy the task. But don't worry, Johnny got lots and lots of money for his troubles.The new Charlie, Freddie Highmore, was decent enough in the tearjerker Finding Neverland. But here, he's just all wrong. His one acting choice seems to be 'Smile Every Time You Say Something,' which I last saw used by Denise Richards in Starship Troopers.On one hand, I wondered as I was watching it whether the movie would fare better with someone who'd never seen the original. But on the other, this film is so disjointed and strange, I'm not sure how anyone could follow it if they hadn't seen the first film. The Oompa Loompa 'songs,' if you can call them that, consist of CG clones singing the same rhyming lines over and over again. There is no narrative or melodic progression to the songs -- they are as two dimensional as cardboard cutouts.Add to this bland, unimaginative mix a few ghastly changes from the earlier movie: Charlie has a father now, his family magically gets 'unpoor' at the end by the dint of their own optimism, and Willy Wonka learns -- get ready for this one -- that families are not a bad thing.It's beyond awful. Watch the original again instead, I beg of you.",1,25,45,5 November 2005
The Fly," Real science and THE FLY
","The greatest thing about Cronenberg's version of THE FLY is how insightful it was about its science.  In 1985, when this script was being written, Cronenberg and Pogue almost certainly could not have known how close they were to the truth of things regarding DNA.Scientists have known for quite a while that just as all computer programs can ultimately be broken down to 1's and 0's, the fundamental building blocks of human life are the same in all living things.  Human beings and flies share over 95 percent of the same DNA code.  So, the concept of combining these two things on a 'molecular-genetic level' is not as far-fetched as it might seem.  In fact, scientists actually have done it the other way around.  They have replaced sections of fruit fly DNA with human DNA, and bred honest-to-goodness humanflys.A much newer discovery is even more fascinating in light of THE FLY.  Dolly, the sheep clone, recently developed arthritis.  That's not interesting in and of itself:  sheep commonly get that ailment.  The strange thing is that Dolly got it at a much younger age than she should have.  Scientists believe that it has something to do with the fact that she was cloned.  It's as if the sheep lost something in the copying process.  Now, this does NOT make scientific sense.  Cloning is like copying a CD: it's digital.  The exact same DNA should create an organism that has exactly the same body (and chance of getting sick) as the original.  But the real-life experiment with Dolly seem to bear out the idea that there is something creepy and mysterious about messing with things on a genetic level, even if--scientifically--it seems like everything should be kosher.So, in the FLY, when Jeff Goldblum starts slowly metamorphosizing, with both positive and then very negative results, I believe it's scary because it rings true, and we actually believe that it would happen that way.How cool is it when science-fiction actually predicts science, and not the other way around?",Null,0,1,21 January 2002
Mystic River," Settle down folks, it's not THAT good.
","Mystic River is already being lavished with Oscar talk in a year that has seen precious few quality movies.While the movie is certainly worth seeing, I'd hardly call it great.  I think it's gotten inflated notices from the major critics simply because of the star power involved, especially Clint Eastwood.  'Solid' and 'Assured' are the most overused words in reviews when describingEastwood's directing style.  Maybe those are euphemisms for unimaginative--I don't know.  I think Eastwood is being unduly praised for this film. 
Here are a few major criticisms -- some spoilers included.1)  The occasional 'flashes' of memory, such as when Tim Robbins is staring at the pavement and 'flashes back' to his childhood trauma, are unnecessary, and they actually undercut the tension created by the actors.2)  The scene in the bar, where Sean Penn's daughter comes in with her friends, rings so cheesy and false, it really shows how out-of-touch Eastwood is as a director.  It reminded me of bar scenes in movies in the 80s like Top Gun or The Accused, where situations feel so staged and unrealistic.  This scene in particular belonged on an episode of Nash Bridges, not an Oscar-worthy movie.3)  While Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deliver good performances, and Kevin Bacon holds his own, Marcia Gay Harden is horribly over-the-top.  Eastwood should have reined her in for her own good and the good of the movie.4)  As he did with 'Midnight in the Garden...' Eastwood lets this film go on way too long. The Sean Penn/Laura Linney scene in the bedroom at the end is bizarre and emotionally confusing.  The parade scene seems to grope for an ending.  He should have ended the movie with Penn and Bacon walking away from each other.5)  The entire subplot with Kevin Bacon and his estranged wife is handled so poorly, and given such short shrift, it should have been cut completely.  Its use as an attempt to balance the tragedy of the story is almost cringe-worthy.
Mystic River is a decent film.  But before we all get too excited and give a mediocre film the best picture and best director award (can anyone say 'A Beautiful Mind'?) let's actually watch the movie with a critical eye.",6,0,1,29 October 2003
Vanilla Sky," Reviewing the reviewers
","To quote Mel Brooks:  'Critics are like eunuchs at an orgy.  They just don't get it.'It really p***es me off when people trash an ambitious, thought-provoking movie like Vanilla Sky.  They do it because it makes them feel important. Anyone can trash Tomcats, right?  But if you can bash Cameron Crowe, you must be REALLY smart.People put out this bad buzz, and then the ambitious movies don't make as much money, and then we end up with theaters full of Scary Movie III and Dude Where's My Car.  Oh joy.To the people who call this movie 'unfocused':  Look, you cretins.  This is an ambitious film.  It blurs the traditional lines between fantasy and reality, it leaves you hanging in limbo for much longer than you're used to. Most movies tell you exactly what to think.  Vanilla Sky leaves you guessing.  Calling this movie 'unfocused' is another way of saying 'I need to be spoon fed the plot!  I'm a cinematic toddler!'  Go watch Legally Blonde and talk about how cute Reese is in her argyle sweater and leave this movie alone.To those who said Vanilla Sky is full of bad acting:  Excuse me?  I'm sorry, but it is an absolute travesty that Cuba Gooding, Jr., Anna Paquin, Jack Palance and Marisa Tomei have acting Oscars, and Tom Cruise doesn't.  He's a great talent, no question.  He takes chances.  He plays strange, even unlikeable roles, and he's not afraid.  We need to give him his Oscar, because there's a bit of desperation creeping in to his recent work--as if he's doing acting backflips to get respect.  Penelope Cruz is gorgeous and likeable.  Cameron Diaz could get by on just being HOT.  But she doesn't. She takes roles in Being John Malkovich, and Vanilla Sky, and she even elevated her character in Best Friend's Wedding.  Brava, Cammie.To those who say the movie is too long:  I'm sorry, but when Pearl Harbor comes in at 3 hours, I think I can forgive Vanilla Sky for being 135 minutes (not 150, as a million reviewers have incorrectly stated).  As if all of you geniuses who have time to write reviews on IMDB can't spare an extra 15 minutes.To those who say 'it's not as good as Almost Famous':  Whatever.  In two years you'll be trashing Crowe's next movie and talking about how brilliant Vanilla Sky was.I'm not saying people have to love everything.  It's fine to have high standards.  But don't trash a movie that aims high and doesn't quite reach the stars, or you'll end up with a bunch of middle-of-the-road pap.Thank God there are a few American directors left that still have enough confidence to take chances and make us think:  Wes Anderson, Ang Lee, and Cameron Crowe.  And Tarantino, if he ever directs again.Vanilla Sky:  8.0/10.0   Critics:  0.0/10.0",Null,0,0,15 December 2001
Trainspotting," F*cking brilliant
","Trainspotting is what film should be: honest, imaginative, surprising, and groundbreaking.LIke Goodfellas, Trainspotting is a meandering movie that manages to grip you the entire time. It is funny and heartbreaking at the same time, anchored by Ewan MacGregor's absolutely devastating performance as Renton. Put his performance up against the Best Actor nominees in any given year and I dare you to say it doesn't belong.Contrary to what others have posted, Trainspotting absolutely made an impact here in the States. That may have been to Danny Boyle's detriment as he's never quite reached the same heights since.But for us, in the U.S., you have to realize that it was basically a foreign film because you can't understand about 25% of the dialogue because the accent is so thick. Begbie's dialogue is purposely opaque, I think. Not that it matters - the performance is rock solid.If you haven't seen the movie, go out and get it. It's in my all-time Top 10, and it holds up beautifully over time.",10,7,10,27 January 2008
Amélie," The race is over
","When I left the theater last night, I had that elated, buzzing, and yet somewhat sad feeling that means only one thing:  I knew the race was over. I had seen the best movie of 2001.I've read several of the comments picking Amelie apart.  That's fine, that's what this forum is for.  But I disagree with the critics, and I agree with the fans:  I think this is an astonishing film.I always judge a movie on its own terms.  I don't judge it on some outside criteria of how long it should be, how realiastic it should be.  A movie should not be a confirmation of our own worldview.  It should be a trip into another person's head, a taste of someone else's vision.And the vision of this director, Jeunet, is nothing less than stunning.I had seen City of Lost Children, and was ready for the visual feast.  But Jeunet has taken a huge step forward here.  Has a female character been more lovable than Amelie since Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly?  The palate of characters is funny, human, tragic, and full of longing.  The movie pushes you to the edge of your imagination in an exhilarating and yet confident way.Go to the theater ready to laugh, ready to fall in love, and ready to experience something wonderfully different.  Do this, and Amelie will make you believe in the magic of film.",10,1,3,28 November 2001
Heat," Heat passes the test
","'Heat' has been in nearly constant rotation on HBO lately, and while I was never a passionate fan of this movie, I have to say that it passes the test. That is, whenever I flip to a channel and 'Heat' is on, I am inevitably drawn in for at least an hour of it.  Even when I do NOT have that hour to spare.  It's a riveting movie.  Pacino and De Niro are working in their sweet spots and the dirty, slimy sheen of Los Angeles rings very true.  A Michael Mann film will never be spotless, it will always over-reach and be, at certain points, pretentious.  But Michael Mann's films always draw me in, and 'Heat' is his best.",Null,0,0,4 June 2002
Gangs of New York," An epic disappointment
","Just returned from a Writer's Guild screening of 'Gangs of NewYork,' and the news is not good.  The movie certainly has its nicemoments (I would hope so -- at close to three hours you shouldstumble on good moments every once in a while) but overall, itsimply does not work.  It fails as entertainment.Chief among the problems is the movie's pedantic approach to itssubject.  'Gangs' comes off like the history lecture you fell asleepin in college.  There are long sequences that attempt to give thebigger picture of the social struggles in Civil War-era New York. Each of these sequences is accompanied by on-the-nose voiceover that tells us nothing more than what we are seeing. There's no dramatic core to it.  Granted -- this is an under-reportedera in our nation's history, when ideas of patriotism and civic dutyclashed with the reality that the country was built on the backs ofimmigrants.  But for God's sake, if you're going to teach history,make a documentary.Scorcese (and Pileggi) used voiceover to virtuoso effect in'Goodfellas.'  But that voiceover had its own idiom, the language ofthe streets that Scorcese loves so well.  And it had a point of view: Henry Hill's narration crackled with the energy of a man falling inlove with crime.  DiCaprio's voiceover is as deadly dull as aSunday School lecture.  And what's worse, he loses his accent halfthe time.  On top of it, the words themselves simply report theaction, or, lacking drama, become too flowery.  The screenwritersstrain to create emotion when none is there.At the WGA screening, two of the screenwriters attested thatScorcese hired a third, Ken Lonergan, to add the voiceover aftereverything else had been written.  I have no idea why this wasdone.  It's completely superfluous and it hurts the movie.On to the acting.  I'm afraid the news doesn't get much better.
Everyone is falling over themselves saying how great Daniel DayLewis was.  Take a step back, people.  Lewis certainly hascharisma to spare.  But half the time he seems to be doing a badDeniro impression.  His scenery-chewing gets more and moreover the top as the movie goes on.  This performance is about onpar with Tim Roth's performance in 'Rob Roy.'  What?  You sayyou don't remember that?  Exactly.Cameron Diaz looks ridiculously out of place in this movie.  I'msorry to say it, because I love her work, and she normally makessmart choices.  Not this time.  I just don't buy her as a whoringorphan pickpocket. She tries very hard, and she even bringshumor and spark to the role.  But come on!  You can't have it bothways!  You can't tell us how rough and tumble the streets of NewYork were in 1860, and then show us Cameron Diaz as a pickpocket, looking like she just finished a revlon commercial!People will be put off by the violence.  Some will be horrified by it.  Idon't mind the violence.  I just didn't care about it at all.  It was allso predictable and pat.  There were SO many characters, and SOMANY get killed, that in the end you didn't feel that much for anyone of them.Which brings me to my final beef.  LESS IS MORE.  Less, Marty, isMORE.  This movie was three hours long because it is trying totrick people into thinking it is 'Epic' and 'Artsy.'  In other words,they're hoping it will be nominated for Best Picture before anyonecan figure out that it isn't any good.  And it just may work.  But if themovie had been trimmed down by about an hour (removing thelast forty minutes would have helped), it would have benefittedgreatly.  As long as the story focused on the main three characters,it at least worked as melodrama.  When it tried to bring in thebigger, sprawling historical context, it became muddled, tiresomeand completely without drama.I'm not taking anything away from Martin Scorcese.  Even the greatones miss once in a while.  But don't see this movie unless you'vegot a lot of time and you can forgive a lot of faults.",3,2,7,16 December 2002
