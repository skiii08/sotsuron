Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Thumbs up
","I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end. A lot of action and I really enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes character played by Robert D Jr. A awesome cast and a great story. I was surprised this movie was directed by Guy Ritchie, he did a great job on this one, keep them coming. Its good to see Robert D Jr at his best again. The humour in this movie was also very good and made it also the movie that it is. Jude Law played his character also very well, and I was amused by Sherlock Holmes's brother.The costumes and sets looked amazing. I would have loved to see this movie in the cinema, but watched it via movie on demand. I definitely recommend this movie to my friends and family and I don't do that quickly.",8,0,0,23 June 2012
A Star Is Born," Brilliant
","I was a bit sceptical at first about this duo, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga for this movie. But heck, they both gave a super great performance. They both surprised me. Bradley for his awesome singing, and Lady Gaga for her great acting. I'm not a big fan of this type of movies normally, but I really wanted to see this one. And I'm glad I did.
I left the theater in tears. 
If this movie doesn't get recognition at the Oscars, then something is wrong at the Acadamy.",10,4,8,8 October 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," Kudos to great acting performances!
","Alright, alright, alright.... I was very impressed with the performance that Matthew McConaughey has given in this movie. His physical commitment, drama level and everything he did to create the whole character. Also Jared Leto was very good. I loved his part in this movie. Their commitment to these roles made it all very believable. For Matthew, I think it is his best part ever. Kudos to the actors, directors and everyone involved, but especially to Matthew McConaughey! I gave it 9 stars in total. 1 DVD I will add to the collection for sure! I hope this will also shed again some more positive light for the gay community. Afterall, we are all the same. I have nothing bad to say about this movie at all.",9,2,2,26 February 2014
