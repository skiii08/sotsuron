It," Sadly it is not very effective
","IT is an adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 horror novel of the same name. It is a story of a group of friends in a small town who are terrorized by the eponymous entity who is in the form of a clown and the subsequent attempt of the group to fight that being and uncover a mystery. Being a horror movie it has some good terrifying scenes and twist and turns but at the core it is a movie about friendship. While it is not exactly a Magnum Opus, it's not a bad movie either. The main theme of the story is Friendship and what it means to have a good friend. From the very beginning of the movie, every character is shown as different and meek and hence is constant source of bullying. They find solace with each other and form a gang called loser's club and enjoy each other's company.The subsequent growth of the character and defeating their deepest fear is depicted nicely.The another main theme of the movie is quashing your fear. It is clearly shown that the entity feeds on the fear of an individual. Hence to defend themselves or to defeat him they need to vanquish their fears. While watching movie, it was clearly evident that the movie is less of a horror and is more of a coming-of-age tale where characters by various means conquer their fears and learn more about their identity via a series of misadventures and learn about meaning of life, friendship, love, sexuality, loss and fear. So lets talk about pros. and cons. of the movie and what is my personal opinion after watching this movie.PROS.Performance of the cast - I really loved the performance of the cast. Everyone was suitable and acted well in their roles but the cast member which stood out for me is Sophia Lillis. I really liked her performance. The way in which she essayed the role of a sexually abused teen is seriously commendable. Other cast member like Jack Dylan Grazer, Jaeden Lieberher and Jeremy Ray Taylor were excellent in their respective roles.Their chemistry was endearing and organic. Another stand out role for me was that of Nicholas Hamilton. He really performed well in the role of a mentally troubled young sociopath.Musical score - Music of the film was quite good and matched consummately with the theme of the movie. The background score was also quite good which helped in intensifying the fear at some critical moments during the film.Well developed characters - The characters in the film are well written and developed which is a rare feat for a horror movie. The reason of every character's inherent fear is explained well. That's why characters feel so authentic while watching movie.Screenplay - IT is a rare horror film where so much effort has been put in writing. Screenplay is commendable.Cinematography - Cinematography of the film completely reflects the mood of the film be it the happy time with friends or be it the haunting wall of the entity. The camera accurately captures the tone of film and which in turn makes the movie more terror-stricken.CONS.Over reliance on Jump Scares - While the source material provides excellent opportunity to delve into the psychology of characters, the makers seemed to ignore it. While it could have been an excellent psychological horror film but due to excess reliance on jump scares it turns into an another run-of-the-mill horror film. This movie can be sighted as a prime example of why jump scare sucks? I was really disappointed due to the lack of genuinely frightening scenes in place of sleazy jump scares.Muddled storytelling - Storytelling could have been far more better. Some scene jumps from one to another without any proper motive or meaning. Also the film takes too long to build.Runtime - The film really test the patience of viewers too much during the film. The film could easily have been shortened by up to 15-20 minutes. 2nd half drags too much especially during overly long climax.Performance of Bill Skarsgard - This might be a controversial opinion but i really didn't like performance of eponymous character. While Bill tried his level best, it was evident that during some scenes he was trying a bit too much which was really unaffecting for me. The more he came to screen, the less menacing he became.Average direction - While the direction was not bad, it was not good either. Considering the fact that you have a great source material and a well written screenplay, you need to add some extra score points to the movie by using your direction. Instead of focusing on psychological aspects of the story, he focuses more on terrifying audiences with music and the clown, but after a certain point it all starts to fall flat. I am not exactly condemning direction but i am not impressed either by the endeavors of Andy Muschietti.So, in the end its another run-of-the-mill horror film despite having a great story.",6,0,2,8 November 2017
Alexander," Epic saga of a great leader
","Alexander,as the name suggests,its about the life of Alexander the great.It was a good movie so i couldn't understand why they are trashing it so badly.It was a well intented inspiring movie.The movie is like a tribute to one of the world's greatest military leaders.Every frame boasts of epicness and perfection.I loved its story which begins when Alexander was 5 years old.Its non-linear narrative was like a cherry on the cake.The movie showed the whole events in a manner which was not filmy so it looked very close to the reality.This movie mainly focused on the expeditions took by Alexander to conquer the whole world.He was truly a genius and ahead of his time.Many times he was blamed by calumniators who were only hungry for the throne and money and were worried as why he is donating money in poor.The movie was also very accurate historically.It also showed about the society where eunuchs were allowed.Alexander always fought for the benefit of public.The movie depicts everything in a grandeur fashion but the screenplay feels lousy.It was too sluggish in the beginning but picked its speed soon.The ending was poignant but confusing.In acting section everyone was OK except Angelina jolie.She was mind-blowing and essayed the role of a throne hungry mom perfectly.She proved again why she is one of the most talented actress.Music was nice.Visuals were good.The war scenes lacked enthusiasm but were grand.The movie also needed to be shortened as it was too long.Overall it was an engaging historical epic saga of rivalry,bravery,beguile and throne.Truly people remember only those who thinks and do ahead of their time and Alexander was one of them.

Divergent," Not that bad
","Divergent is a dystopian sci fi film about a futuristic world.If you have seen Hunger games then you may note many similarities between them.But it is not as sharp as The hunger games.Story was good but was wasted.It explores the theme of authority,genus and exploring ourself.It indirectly also hints us about a catastrophic future where everything has been destroyed due to war.Our own world is going on the very same way so we should now stop fighting against each other and should work for peace.Still you love fighting then fight against terrorism to bring peace all over the globe. Many friends suggested me this movie by saying that it is completely different.I would like to inform them that its not new as many movies had been made before on the very same idea.The start of the film was slow and boring.The middle of the film was also slow but it was average.In the climax the movie picked its speed but the climax was too convlucted and unimaginative.The ending was left open for its sequel.If you are going to make a trilogy then you have to make the 1st movie a solid one so that the audience may become interested in but the movie was average at its best.The movie deals with a good topic but doesn't explore it in a very nice way.First half of the movie was too prosaic.Visuals were good and acting was average.It was so pleasant to watch Kate Winslet in such a role.She was simply awesome.If you are a kid of 15 then you might like it and if you are a fan of Battle royale and Hunger games then you might leave it.If you could indure its first half then you may watch it.

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Better than its predecessor
","This is an amazing experience and trust me it is even better than its predecessor.The story of this movie is good but whats makes this movie amazing is its storytelling which is simply great.Voice cast is very good.Visuals are amazing and the music is so mesmerizing.I want to praise Dean DeBloise for choosing a more darker and serious tone as compared to the first one.Emotional scenes are very powerful and deep.I liked the first film very much so i was worried whether this one will entertain me like the first movie or not.This is among those rare sequels which carries the success of the first film graciously over its shoulder at the same time doesn't turns pale in comparison.A thrilling,satisfying,and fast paced saga of a viking......",8,1,6,21 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Funny space adventure
","After watching GOTG only thing i can say is wow.....Its visuals,art direction,acting,humour,music,cha racters,everything was just so amazing.The story has nothing new to offer but its approach is so fresh.Screenplay was so firm and friable.I also loved the characterization of the movie.Especially Rocket and Groot were truly amazing.It contains all the classic marvellish thrills and humour.This movie also introduced some great characters such as Cosmos,Howard,Thanos etc. which makes this movie universe more interesting.Acting is another strong point and everyone was superb.Dave bautista is a surprise package.He was so natural and acted perfectly like an insane savage.Vin diesel was good even when he didn't had much dialogs.One liners were too funny especially those which were spoken by Bradly cooper.I was laughing from start to finish.Visuals were great and music was very good.Direction of the movie is another strong point.The plot contained some holes but were very minor.Climax of the movie is a little weird.If you are a fan of Marvel then it is a must watch for you and if you are not then it will make you a fan.This movie expands Marvel cinematic universe so broadly and added a new chapter in it.A nice and funny space adventure saga.....",8,1,4,8 December 2014
Happy New Year," Average attempt
","Happy new year is not a new type of cinema,it is the usual masala bollywood flick which is loosely inspired by OCEAN'S ELEVEN.The story is very simple as Charlie want revenge from a diamond dealer who cheated his father and sent him to jail.In order to get the revenge,he steals 9 precious diamonds from the businessman.Acting of everyone is good except vivan.Songs are good and feels nice while hearing.The main problem of the movie is it paperthin and predictable plot.The film is also too long.It could have been trimmed by 20 minutes.Overall i am not very much happy with this film.I am a big fan of shahrukh khan and i expected more.His previous film CE was much better than this one.Overall a timepass flick...",6,0,0,13 November 2014
The Godfather," Excellent but not great....
","The godfather is widely regarded as the greatest film ever made in the history of cinema.Widely considered a milestone,the movie inspired countless films. It might be a shame to admit but i hadn't seen this movie until 2015.After nearly 42 years of its release i finally got a chance to watch it.After watching the movie i found its story to familiar.It is because i have watched countless movies which are directly or indirectly inspired by this film and i must say that this movie was far better than those rip- offs. The movie has a great story.It shows the transition of a reluctant family-man to a crime family boss.The screenplay is absorbing.The cast is wonderful and everybody is peerless in their respective roles.In short this film is superb and wonderful.But i can't consider it as a great film.I don't know why it is called so?May be it had been a very original story during 70's but now it is not so.I am not a film scholar,neither i am a movie buff nor a cinema aficionado but i have seen many classics of World cinema and i found some movies which are far better than this one. I am not saying that this is not a great film.It is great,after all so many people like this and so many can't be wrong.This is a respectable movie after all this movie has influenced countless films.This movie might be great but not the greatest ever. This is an excellent example of mobster film.Positive points of this film are its evergreen story,its soulful musical score,its engaging screenplay,nice direction,great dialogs and amazing acting.The only negative point of the movie is its slow pace and overlong runtime.So at last i want to say that it is an awesome piece of art and everybody must watch it.May be due to time difference or due to cultural gap,i was unable to grasp it completely. 7.9 out of 10 is my final rating.",8,1,3,24 October 2015
