Child 44," A story too long, little in return
","Quite a disappointing experience to watch this long disjointed film. You would not be blamed for believing you might be in for an epic telling of the U.S.S.R during Stalin reign of terror. However, it then moves to the telling of the heroic actions of a loyal red army soldier giving up everything he worked so hard for to save the life of his beloved.As you have no choice, because by now you would have had invested over an hour in this film, you follow them on this random journey, you might hope this love story will lead you somewhere insightful or extraordinary. You aimed too high! because when you are about to settle down on this story it moves again randomly to the investigation of a serial killer in the U.S.S.R. This bit is based on the great film Citizen X, a famous real case that saw the introduction of profiling in this part of the world to assist in the the investigation of serial killing.Once you realize this is where it is going you might as well save yourself precious time and get the real deal 'Citizen X'. I guess this is why this film is so long and chaotic, a manifestation of a very confused story teller who cant make up his/her/their minds which story they want to actually tell!",5,1,4,17 August 2015
