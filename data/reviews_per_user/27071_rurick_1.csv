Changeling," WOW - Oscar Material!
","What I thought would be just another mediocre Jolie flick quickly turned into a gripping, glued-to-the-seat drama. Angeline Jolie is superb in this true story about the 1920's LAPD, and the lengths they went to prove her wrong. Mr. Eastwood again rewards us with a film reminiscent of all his past works combined. Jolie and Eastwood need to expand on this new found relationship and give us more, more, more!!!! The cinematography alone is Oscar worthy, and I will be really disappointed if this film is not nominated for Oscars all around. I rarely buy DVDs anymore, but I will purchase this one as a keeper. As a history buff I am thankful that Eastwood and company have enlightened us and made us aware of this dark period in LA's past.",Null,2,4,11 October 2009
