Men in Black 3," Very Disappointed
","My wife and I both thought that MIB3 was very boring. The writing, in our opinion, was good but, the acting seemed over rehearsed ( for lack of a better word). We just never found ourselves really enjoying, or caught up in the movie. It seems that with todays movie effects, Directors are relying on the effects to carry the movie. It seems the story was good but something happened with how the movie was done. There were only a few chuckles in this movie. Nothing really funny like in the previous two. Good movies will have you captivated to the point you forget you are watching a movie. We felt like we were just sitting in the theatre burning time until the last 10-15 min. of the movie. I thought the ending was really good and it tied in really well to the story line of all 3 films. The special effects were great and many people will be happy with that. Although, my wife and I left the theatre very disappointed.",3,11,24,3 June 2012
WALLÂ·E," A Perfect Movie
","I saw this movie in full digital, if you did not get that opportunity,then you missed out. This movie had the best graphics I have ever seen. The story was great and it was rated G! I am tired of all the PG-13/Rated R junk that Hollywood has been cranking out. I knew there was someone out there that could make an outstanding movie and not be full of filth. I want more movies like this. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen. Go back and find it in Full Digital to really appreciate it. Thanks Pixar! Top Notch job! I can not wait for this to come out on DVD. I will be buying it on Blue-Ray and getting a blue-ray player so I can see everything this movie has to offer.",10,1,4,4 July 2008
