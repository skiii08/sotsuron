The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A story that could've been told in 30 minutes...
","Breaking Dawn as a book is quite extensive, it takes up more than one afternoon to read it, but a lenghty book doesn't necessarily requires to be split in two parts when making the screenplay adaptation, and sadly, the core story during this first part takes only 30 minutes to be told with the rest being only space filler.Bella Swan has gone through quite an ordeal in the last 3 movies to maintain her relationship with the vampire Edward Cullen, despite that relationship actually threatening the well-being and stability of covenants made by mythological werewolves, other vampire clans, human beings and the Cullen family, they only seem to care about loving each other, no matter who has to die or in what kind of gruesome way must a fetus be conceived.The movie at some times falls into a category that I could describe as disturbing, actually disgusting, we see a skeletal Bella Swan, complete with broken ribs, spine and with a huge bruised belly, about to deliver a vampire baby, actually drinking packages of human blood, and the director didn't hesitate to be graphical on this one, or on the birth scene, in which Edward actually bites Bella's genitals and other parts of her deformed, destroyed body to try and revive her.On the other hand we see a wolf clan breaking apart and having it's members fight over, because one of their kind is obsessed over a girl who has an obsession of her own but for vampires and who keeps endangering their species, not only turning them against vampires (which happen to be their most hated enemy), but also violating sacred rules which their kind established centuries ago.The screenplay is really flawed, the script sound cheesy and fake, most of the dialogue seems pretty rehearsed, and every action seems to take forever to be performed, this because they needed to fill time so they can release a second part.We see a lot of useless actions that happen, Bella spends 5 minutes shaving her legs, another 5 frying chicken, another 5 playing chess, another 5 receiving a hairpin for her wedding, and another 5 drinking human blood with a straw.In the end, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 takes a huge step back from last year's Eclipse, there's no great action sequences, and the only one, which is the Cullen Vs Werewolf battle, is only 2 minutes long and in complete darkness, there's no concrete climax, the cliffhanger ending that is supposed to be the starting point for next year's movie is not only predictable but also incoherent, just because she turned into a vampire all of a sudden her hair was dyed, makeup automatically applied, nails done, and fake eyelashes appeared.4/10",4,5,8,25 November 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The beginning of an epic trilogy
","'The Fellowship of the Ring' marks the beginning of the film adaptations of the 'Lord Of The Rings' saga of books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it was directed by Peter Jackson.As charming, poignant, endearing and action packed as expected, TFOTR is an amazing beginning to the franchise with huge production values, excellent visual effects and an impeccable script writing and supervision.With a stellar cast and an very adequate soundtrack, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' tells us the story of a pair of the miniature hobbit creatures Frodo Baggings (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) whom get involved in a magical quest to destroy the one ring that belongs to the demon Sauron and which must be destroyed in order to erase the demon from earth and return peace to the land of Middle Earth. The concept may sound simple, but it is the brilliant execution and the amount of detail, originality and great acting that successfully bring together this live-action adaptation, the script will make you inevitably care about all the characters from the fellowship, each and every one of them have a specific role in the story, and you will want to continue watching the rest of the trilogy as soon as this film ends.In the end, The Fellowship of the Ring contains a perfect script, well executed dialogue, chill-inducing moments, tons of action, it's fair share of funny moments and throat knotting farewells, which all combine to make it an amazing film that will awaken every emotion in your body.",9,0,1,7 January 2011
