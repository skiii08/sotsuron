The Blair Witch Project," Garbage
","This movie was utter trash.  Most of the previous negative reviews have already stated the reasons why I think it was so bad, so I won't bother repeating them.  The best part of the movie was the end, and it wasn't because of the content of the movie, it was because of the fact that it was OVER. Don't waste your money renting this.",1,6,11,8 January 2000
