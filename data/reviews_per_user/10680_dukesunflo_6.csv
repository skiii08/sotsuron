The Blair Witch Project," A Student Film about the idiocy of Student Filmmakers
","I can take the film two ways.   One is that it is a metaphor for the horror of student filmmaking.   You have a bunch of people with pretentious aspirations who dig themselves a deep hole shooting too much worthless grainy footage, argue a lot, use the F word too much, and end up with (as the movie ends) nothing.Or we can take it for a low budget movie that creates a little tension, but not much else.
Where should we start?  First, let's talk about the fact that they are in the woods forever and have unlimited battery power.   Or how about the fact that they manage to run with a tiny eyepiece on their eye through the woods. How about the fact that they seem to pick up every sound on their equipment and shoot oodles on a 16 mm camera (which takes huge spools of film for just 10 minutes worth of time).  The movie seems like a really long joke that somebody would tell you just to make you mad with the lack of a punchline.   A horrible disappointment, no matter how much money it cost.",2,0,2,18 December 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Worse than I thought it would be!
","And I mean that in a good way.   This has to be the single most crude movie I have ever seen.   Absolutely wonderful gags that manage skewer most of America, be incredibly crude, yet remain sweet on the inside.  Love the movie.   Love the show.",10,0,0,10 December 1999
Jaws," Steven Spielberg could not have made this movie today
","The million dollar golden boy of film couldn't and wouldn't make a film like Jaws again today.   The film was plagued with numerous problems, primarily having to do with a mechanical shark that worked as well as........ well, Spielberg's 1941.   These problems meant that Spielberg couldn't rely on ILM to create shocks, he had to create menace out of the old reliable horror tricks of suspenseful soundtrack, horrors unseen, and unique editing.   The result is a film that holds up far better than most of his films today. It's the only one, except perhaps Schindler's List that deserves the critical accolades thrown at it.   A great movie.  The only problem is that most transfers to video are absolutely dreadful.",9,0,1,28 December 1999
Raging Bull," Most overrated performance in film.
","De Niro got heaps of praise for his performance in Raging Bull.  I'll admit it is gutsy.   But so what.   He gained weight, he lost weight.  He acted like a total slimeball.   So what?   The movie fails completely to explain why anyone would care about Jake LaMotta.   Indeed, nothing about DeNiro's character is attractive.   He fails to show any redeeming qualities in LaMotta, which ultimately makes the movie unbelievable.   The supporting performances, especially from Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are far greater. The fight scenes are a marvel, as is the cinematography and editing.  The core, however, is rotten.",7,6,10,6 December 1999
The Matrix," Great Trailer. Great FX. Silly movie.
","The trailer was like the average comedy trailer.   The best things in the movie are all there.   I loved the effects in the movie, but the story was beyond silly.   Striving for some sort of ultra reality, the movie takes itself FAR too seriously.   I enjoyed watching it, but in the end, I thought the movie was a clever fraud.",3,1,4,5 December 1999
Goodfellas," Scorsese's Finest Film
","Most critics seem to think Scorsese will be remembered for Raging Bull.   I disagree.   THis is pure cinema.  Scorsese works the entire movie like a master, using freeze frames, slow motion, stunning steadicam work, and other techniques in a way that adds meaning to the work.   From start to finish, this film is the opposite side of an equally wonderful film, The Godfather. It shows us the unvarnished reality of the mob, the petty arguments, the likable psychos, and general absurdities of a life of crime.   The movie never stops moving and is one of the few movies I've ever seen that left me in awe at the end.    This one was robbed of an Oscar. Time will show that this is the one people remember from the 1990s.   My 3rd favorite film of all time behind Godfather I & II.",10,0,0,6 December 1999
