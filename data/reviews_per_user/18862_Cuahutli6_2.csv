The Incredible Hulk," Great movie
","Just saw the movie last night and I'm happy to say that I was very pleased with the movie. The first Hulk movie was kind of a let down. The Hulk was so over the top and unbelievable. He was made to be something that he wasn't. This one was was quite the opposite.From the start it I felt as though riding a roller coaster. A slow start a nice build up, then the trough, then once again a bigger build up then a long level ride. then the final heart thumping thrill ride that leaves you cheering and, like any adrenaline junkie, wanting so much more.I wish that they would have developed Betty Ross' character a little more but over all they did a great job.",10,5,8,15 June 2008

","Yes, the story may be predictable, yes, the message may be predictable so if you are one of those people looking for a picture 'with depth' this may not be the movie for you. If you want 'drama' and well developed 'dramatis personae' then stay home. This movie is for Trekkies, and Star Wars, Blade Runner fans. In other words, this is for the person who wants to be entertained. For the person who wants to see amazing graphics and action. For the person who wants to escape for almost three hours from the daily grind of daily life. I went to see this with my family and thought that it was and amazing blend of CG graphics and action and adventure. I was able to spend the time imagining living in another world far from the crap we have here nowadays. I recommend going to see it in 3D and I could only imagine what it may have looked like in Imax but since we don't have one of those near by then I'll settle for the 'standard'. But yes, if you enjoy wallowing in in 'drama' save you money and stay home and watch reruns of ER or Hill Street Blues or whatever, but if you just want to have fun then for Pete's sake go watch this thing it WAS GREAT!",10,13,22,19 December 2009
