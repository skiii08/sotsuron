The Blair Witch Project," real but thin
","As usual, the IMDB reviewers are divided on whether this is crap or good, and again it's because the movie is different, and will appeal to different people.  The acting is ok, a combination of sincerity and amateurishness that that gives it a realistic feel.  The shakey photography might bug some people, but it fit what was happening.  Was it scary? ... it had a certain suspense to it, but there was nothing to make you scream.  The drama among the 3 movie makers was the strongest part, how they handled events.  The ending fit the myth or legend, but was simple and unenlightening.Viewers who like pretty, glitzy, show biz movies will think this is crap, and those who are interested in offbeat flicks like Last Night will find it interesting.   -Bob",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
The Mummy," yes, silly fun
","One reviewer picked the perfect title for his review, 'silly fun', which summed this one up nicely.  And another reviewer did a good job of picking apart the plot holes.  The movie tries to expand on Indiana Jones' funny quips, to the extent that the script spends a ton of time on cracks and quips, reducing the story to silliness instead of the suspense that the Indy Jones movies had.  The hero even expresses this observation, about halfway through, when for the umteenth time some noisy spirit swooshes out of an object they are opening, and he says with a smirk, 'That happens a lot around here.'So for those who like their creature features serious, they'd be better off renting Russell Mulcahey's 'Tale of the Mummy', where the cast does take it seriously, although there isn't as much action or effects.But The Mummy is fine for good silly fun. -Bob",Null,0,0,3 October 1999
Notting Hill," light and cute
","As a romantic chick-flick the film delivers on the relationship between Grant and Roberts, they have an intensity that matches Meet Joe Black and Sleepless In Seattle, much better than You've Got Mail.  But it's very light, there is none of the depth of a great love story.  The quirky supporting roles are a laugh, and it moves along well.  Worth a few rental bucks.   -Bob",Null,0,0,21 November 1999
Pitch Black," not bad except for the cast
","I agree with most of the positive reviews on this one, it's a pretty good Alien clone.  A minor complaint was the jerky camera work, it didn't add to the mood, and a bigger complaint is about the shallow characters.  You'll find yourself not caring much who gets killed next, but see if you can guess who will survive and who will get eaten, it's a surprise. -Bob",Null,0,0,6 August 2001
Meet Joe Black," best chick-flick of the year
","Alright, it's a chick-flick guys ... nothing blows up and ppl cry ... but it's excellent.  It way better than You've Got Mail for intensity, Hopkins daughter is just so intense.  This is adult love, not that teen stuff like Titanic.  It's worth it just to see Brad Pitt pretending to be a virgin in bed ... he probably can't even remember his first time ... a bazillion women ago, but it's priceless.  And most ppl won't see the ending coming, because we really aren't sure how the Grim Reaper operates.  See it guys, it's really first-date calibre, so take your babe.  -Bob",Null,0,1,20 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," adolescent
","I had to agree with reviewers Dan, Cupid, Flick, Stephanie and others who didn't see much in this movie.  My main complaint was the Tom and Nicole were acting like kids.  She's a professional woman who gets all upset and distraught over a fantasy.  (Get a grip Nicole).  And he's a doctor who can't even come to terms with his own sexuality.  (Looks cool, acts like a nerd). They're both like a couple lost and confused teenagers.The orgy is standard stereotypical male group sex.  The women who saw this with us said it was a sexual turn-off for them, nothing horny going on there (bad date flick :-)   Good plot idea, so much more could have been done with it.   -Bob",Null,0,1,12 March 2000
