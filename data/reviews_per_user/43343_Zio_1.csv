Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A movie for kids!
",This is just a perfect example of how to make money on the good reputation of the old Star Wars movies. This movie is made for kids between 6-13. Along with all the 'new' toys this is like if history repeats itself (the first Star Wars movie). It's simply a huge hoax. 10 actors at most (the rest is animation cartoon movie?).,6,0,1,27 May 1999
