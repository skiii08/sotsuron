The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Keeping You Hungry For More
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is the first half of the third and final book in the Hunger Games series and sees Katrina moving to district 12, following the reported destruction of district 13.However, Katrina returns to District 13 accompanied by Finnick, Beetee and Gale and meets the leader, President Coin, who, supported by her friends, persuades Katrina to become a symbol of rebellion and unity for the rebels......The Mockingjay. But, despite Katrina agreeing to become The Mockingjay, her main aim is to rescue Peeta, who is being held by the capital in the quaterquell. After slow start, the movie soon kicks into gear and sees Katrina (Jennifer Lawrence.) back to her bow and arrow weal-ding best. The sets are massive and the look and feel of desolation is quite something to behold. The movie then moves at the usual break neck speed, with plenty of explosions and fast paced action sequences, that will keep fans satisfied. There is also a good sprinkling melancholy as you see Katrina feeling the strain and hopelessness of the situation she now finds herself in. If you enjoyed the first two movies, you will undoubtedly love this one, another well made movie and Francis Lawrence's direction is breathtaking at times. The Mockingjay Part 1 will have you eagerly waiting for Part 2 for sure.",7,2,13,16 December 2014

","Directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie tells the gripping and tragic story of Chris Kyle, an American Sniper, responsible for 250 deaths, 160 of which are acknowledged by the American military.

The Theory of Everything," Quite Lovely
","The Theory of Everything is a movie about the much talked about Theoretical Physicist, Cosmologist and Author, Stephen Hawking. The movie only briefly touches on the science that's made him what he is today. Instead, concentrating, on his former wife Jane Hawking's book: Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The movie opens at a party, where Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who's a friend of his sister They strike up a conversation and find a real connection, so much so that Jane, scribbles down her number on a sheet of paper and hands it to Hawking before leaving. His relationship with Jane blossoms and they soon begin to spend more and more time together. However, he soon begins to find that simple tasks are becoming difficult and following an accident, tests confirm that he has motor neurone disease. He subsequently shuts himself away, as the condition begins to take hold and spends most of his time alone, that is until Jane begins to talk him round.The Theory of Everything is a beautiful peace of movie making, with Redmayne's performance quite outstanding. You see Hawking the loving Father, caring Husband and a man who likes to make people laugh. A quite memorable movie that I am so pleased to have seen as it has made me see Stephen Hawking in a completely different light.",8,2,4,5 January 2015
The Imitation Game," Sensational
","I must be honest, I was in two minds about going to see this movie, as over the years, I have been to see many movies that are based on actual events, only to be left feeling let down and frustrated. I needn't have worried, as The Imitation Game delivers on all fronts. It's a movie that I could easily see again and again and spot something different each time.It's strange, but I knew nothing about the pioneering mathematician, logician and cryptanalyst Alan Turin, but was aware of the enigma code and the efforts to try and break it. Benedict Cumberbatch is a sensation as Turin, bringing a realism and believability that is often lacking in movies of this nature. I found myself feeling his every emotion as he battles his own demons, the many obstacles that present themselves and the people that want him to fail. I wasn't convinced by Keira Knightley in the role of Joan Clark, a woman with more on her mind than just helping Turin break the enigma code. I just couldn't embrace as her as usual in this role and I can't put my finger on why that is. I thought the computer was a joy to watch, churning away, searching for the elusive answers that could ultimately shorten the bloodiest war in history. The Imitation Game takes you away from the fighting, the bombs and chaos of the battlefield and tells a fascinating story of a small groups covert efforts to break the Nazis enigma code.Their chances of success are slim at best with the odds heavily stacked in the Nazis favour.",9,6,14,15 December 2014
Jurassic World," Monstrous Good Fun
","Jurassic World is the fourth movie in the Jurassic series. The movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow and stars amongst others, Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins. Over twenty years have elapsed, since John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), failed in his dream, to build a theme park, housing live Dinosaurs. Now that dream has been realised, with a huge fully functioning park, known as Jurassic World, housing an whole array of prehistoric creatures operating on the very same Island.Brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) are sent to meet up with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who happens to be the parks operations manager. However, on their arrival, they discover that Claire is far to busy trying to find backers to spend time with them and end up being escorted by her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath).Behind the scenes, lessons still need to be learned, as scientists splice the DNA of Dinosaurs, with that of present day animals, to create new, larger and more ferocious creatures. One of which, the Indominus Rex, is the parks new main attraction.Owen Grady (Pratt) trains the Velociraptors, with some quite astonishing results. Head of security, Vic Hoskins ( D'Onofrio), however, believes the Raptors true destiny lies within the US Military. A move that Owen strongly resists, which causes friction between the two.The parks owner, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), asks Owen to check over the new enclosure for the Indominus, before it's presented to the public. Owen immediately tells Clare, that the creature is dangerous, due to it only ever knowing solitude and isolation.A shock wave thunders through the park when it appears the Indominus has escaped. Clare and Owen enter the enclosure and suddenly realise that they're not alone as they come face to face with the beast.The creature makes a dash for freedom and makes it's way in to the islands interior and Masrani sends in a team to try and capture it. However, the team are slaughtered and Clare orders the immediate evacuation of the parks northern sector.Zach and Gray sneak away from Zara and ignoring the order to evacuate, continue in to a restricted zone in a gyro sphere (A strange spherical vehicle), to explore. They come under attack from the huge Indominus, but manage to distract it long enough to escape. They end up at the ruins of the old Jurassic Park visitors centre and manage to get a Jeep running and make their way back to the resort centre. The Indominus continues in it's trail of death and destruction, with all efforts to subdue the beast futile. Hoskins assumes command and comes up with a desperate plan to use the Raptors to track down the Indominus. However, things don't pan out as expected, as the Indominus has Raptor DNA and seems to have the ability to communicate with the Raptors, causing them to turn on the already terrified and powerless humans.The special effects are outstanding as are the interactions between humans and dinosaur, in this, the best of the Jurassic movies.",8,1,7,28 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Excellent
","I have just recently watched The Hobbit The Incredible Journey and decided to jump straight in and watch The Battle of Five Armies and I wasn't disappointed. This film has everything for me, Adventure....Action....Despair....Humour and Jaw Dropping Special Effects. It would be easy for me to give Peter Jackson a big pat on the back for this movie. After all, he was also responsible for the Lord of the Ring movies. But I think he would be the first to acknowledge that movies of this magnitude can not be credited to one man. This is a well made movie with some big performances, none more so than Martin Freeman in the title role, who I don't mind saying had a lump in my throat on more than one occasion. If you look hard enough, you can probably find faults with any movie. As for me on this occasion, I just sat back enjoyed the ride.",10,8,18,13 December 2014

I needn't have worried. Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers on all fronts. The sets are impressive and the action sequences cleverly handled. I haven;t been as charged up for a Star Wars movie since I saw the original back in th 70's. With a strong script that contains, as you'd expect, snippets of humour and top drawer direction from Abrams. The movie picks you up and takes you on thrill ride until a most memorable closing sequence, brings it to a stop. If you still haven't seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens, do so, your in for a treat.",8,3,33,11 January 2016
