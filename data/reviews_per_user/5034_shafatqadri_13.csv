Scarface," Engrossing!!!!!!!!!!
","'Scarface' has a major cult following even now, 25 years after its release. In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster. He did it with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was 'Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.The story is about an immigrant Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Cuba who has come to live the American dream. He is a hard core criminal and starts by being in detention, where he plots a murder. Next, he moves in the Florida where he starts working as a dish washer on a road side joint. The attraction of money and power drives him into taking chance with one drug deal that goes miserably wrong where his friend is killed, and he in turn kills other gang members. With his daring, he starts climbing the ladder of drug dealers, and reaches the pinnacle of power and wealth and gets more and crazier (due to drug addiction). Finally he is shot by his own beloved sister before being brutally killed by invading gang in his own palatial home.It's the one role which you can't imagine Al Pacino playing. This was his comeback film after a short break and what it comeback film it is. I think when Pacino leaves the ungodly earth and people talk about the role he will be remembered for, a lot will say Michael Corleone in The Godfather Trilogy but I will remember him as Tony Montana in Scarface.'Scarface' is quite simply one hell of a movie, especially such an epic example of its genre. It is controversial among both movie fans and critics. The main reasons are because the film contains excessive violence and has become a sort of inspiration for 'gangsters'. I think both are wrong, because the miss the message that it tries to give out. If these people didn't just skip to the final 10 minute shootout, then they would realize what the film really says.Some of the scenes, especially the infamous chainsaw scene, are disturbing. Scarface is as savage as they say and much more. I'll advice parental guidance while watching this movie in front of kids.'Scarface' is rightly acclaimed throughout the film industry as a genre-defining classic, up there with the giants of crime-capers, worthy of an Oscar it never had.",9,2,4,21 May 2008
Chinatown," Enter the Chinatown!!!!!!!!!!
","This is Roman Polanski at his best. I had seen Roman Polanski's The Pianist before I watched Chinatown. I won't bother attempting to summarize this masterpiece. It would be an exercise in futility and would only detract from the genius of the film. Suffice it to say, the plot is complicated and watching this intricate and deadly web unfold is a source of joy that bears many repeated viewings.This is the film credited with creating the mythic figure that we know as Jack Nicholson. His portrayal of a private detective caught in a conspiracy much greater than he can handle is the maypole that the other characters, both naughty and nice, skip around. His charm and his vulnerability keep the viewer interested in the increasingly complex course of events.And the other characters, while not as prominent, are searingly memorable. John Huston's turn as a man wealthy enough to have a different set of laws apply is frighteningly understated with his power. Faye Dunaway manically switches from serenely confident to skittishly fragile as each layer of protective secrets is peeled away.You need to watch CHinatown many times. Many subtle plot points won't be caught on a single viewing. Also the hypnotic pace that is maintained is all the more powerful when you already know what is going to happen. After repeated viewings the ending in particular seems painfully inevitable and as a result all the more tragic. The cynicism of the climax is not terribly surprising when you come to know that Polanski's wife was brutally murdered by some gang several years earlier.Not long after the success of Chinatown, Roman Polanski fled to Europe avoiding a conviction for consensual sex with a thirteen year old girl. Chinatown is likely to remain the pinnacle of his work and a watershed in American cinema.",9,1,3,15 February 2008
As Good as It Gets," Jackson can't beat Udall
","Most films are weakened by questionable dialogue but redeemed by a great premise or resolution. James L. Brooks' 'As Good as It Gets' is quite the reverse: the dialogue is fantastic, but the audience can't buy into the premise for one second. I know, this has been reviewed to death, but I just saw it again when I was home last month and had to laugh all over. Nicholson should get an award for just standing still! His expressions in this movie are priceless. His interaction with Helen Hunt (who may well be one of the best actresses around) make this movie not only believable but also heart warming.Jack Nicholson, in one of his career's best roles, plays Melvin Udall, an obsessive compulsive romance writer who is a regular at the restaurant where Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) works. He insists that she always be his waitress, and she obliges-----not because she likes him, but because... well, the guy is crazy...Throw in Greg Kinnear in an outstanding performance as a gay artist, living within an inch of poverty and Cuba Gooding, Jr., his promoter. And let's not forget his dog! Kinnear makes the mistake of picking the wrong person for a model and gets mugged - badly - is hospitalized, beaten, broken and penniless. While he is laid up in the hospital who gets stuck with the dog but Nicholson - the last person in the world you should ever give a dog to! Love prevails, the dog wins out in the end. Nicholson is hooked and not only that, finds the dog gets him some brownie points with the ladies.1997 was a year that left film-goers a trifle loopy-headed-----Titanic was at the forefront of everybody's mind, and resultantly good art was washed out-----this is the only possible explanation for As Good as It Gets' snafuing Best Picture nomination. Nicholson and Hunt's Best Actor/Actress awards were, however, well-deserved. Despite Udall's snarky and bitter nature, Nicholson provides him with a humanity and resonance that few actors could. Greg Kinnear's prominence has risen since 1997, but his strengths still show here in his role as Simon the Gay Neighbor.However critics panned this movie for being totally unbelievable. I would have to agree-why would Carol fall for Melvin? Why does Melvin change his ways after so many years of acid-tongued insults? I don't know. I know people who disliked the film because Melvin was such a you-know-what. Personally, I love the evil retorts he hurls at any innocent bystander. Maybe it's a sick pleasure, but Nicholson's delivery is perfect and I couldn't help but laugh as he takes on everyone.The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile. There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him.",8,1,2,15 September 2008
Citizen Kane," Brilliant....# 1 move of all times
","Citizen Kane is said to be the greatest film ever made. I haven't seen all of the films ever made in the world, therefore I couldn't make a decision but if the greatest film is out there and even slightly resembles Kane, it is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The intense Orson Welles, the mastermind of the film, was a perfectionist and it showed. He did not confine his film to the limits of the period it was made in and it helped to revolutionize the film industry with Kane. The lighting, editing and cinematography were all basically new to the world. Based on this, it shocked the film industry into being the greatest film ever created.Charles Foster Kane played by Welles himself rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' because he 'thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper.' Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing 'yellow journalism' which, though frowned upon by most critics, proved immensely profitable.The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large 'NO TREPASSING' sign on the gate of Kane's 'Xanadu' dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the vastness of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, 'Rosebud.' With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. The remainder of the film is largely comprised of flashbacks.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien. There had never been a picture like 'Citizen Kane.' It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema techniqueÂ… Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, 'Citizen Kane' electrified a complacent industryÂ… Welles dominated KaneÂ… He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in HollywoodÂ… Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941.Other than the acting and story part, what does it take to make a great movie, yup the cinematography and the editing. I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first. And yes Citizen Kane has it all great great photography and slick editing techniques used that too in those days. So is Citizen Kane the best film ever created? I am not the world's biggest film buff, but I do know that it is incomparable to anything that I have ever seen before. It is truly original and that is what makes it so incredibly brilliant.",10,2,7,25 April 2008
Fargo," Compelling!!!!!!!!! Cannot avoid it.........
","How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top 20 of all time. 'Fargo' is like many Coen brothers films: the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. You can relate it to their Oscar winning film this year 'No COuntry for Old Men' in some ways.Fargo is arguably the Coen Brother's best movie (though personally I think it's their second-best, after No Country For Old Men). I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of the storyline, as many movies concerning crime are often too fast paced and reliant on plot twists. Instead, Fargo's plot develops more through the characters than through what is actually occurring on the screen. The characters themselves, especially Jerry Lundegard, are very well thought out and work in perfect unison with the simplicity of the story. There are no hard-boiled, cynical detectives here, just a simple policewoman who uses basic techniques to outwit her inexperienced counterparts.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable and scary but share a half a brain among them. What was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking and hearkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'.'Fargo' is one of those movies you watch a dozen times a month then forget about it for a few months. After the few months, you pop it in again and the whole movie is brand new again. I recommend everyone watch this movie even if you are not a Cohen Brothers fan. The great thing about the brothers movies is that even if you don't share their same sense of humor and don't laugh once, the movies they make still hold up with their great stories. But if you do share the same sense of humor, the comedy is just another layer of greatness. Fargo has everything; suspense, a good story, humor, brilliant acting and a score that accompanies the visuals perfectly. Out of my 200+ DVD movies collection, Fargo is one of my most watched (along side my Martin Scorsese collection).",10,0,0,12 March 2008
North by Northwest," One of the best of Hitchcock
","The 1950s was a mixture of successes and failures for Alfred Hitchcock. Most of his successes are classic thriller films such as Rear Window, Vertigo and Strangers on a Train. Hitchcock did have some failures such as I Confess and To Catch a Thief, but I think by the end of the 1950s, his successes definitely outweigh his weaker pictures and he finished off this decade with the critically and commercially acclaimed thriller, North by Northwest.North by Northwest follows Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a 'Madison Avenue', advertising man from New York, whose life is turned upside-down when he is mistaken as a government spy by the name of George Kaplan. He is mistaken for being a spy by a man named Lester Townsend (James Mason), who also seems to be a spy and is paranoid that this so called Kaplan figure has secrets about Townsend's organization. Along with his bunch of thugs, who are led by Leonard (Martin Landau), they attempt to turn Thornhill's life upside-down.Now a man on the run, Thornhill runs off to Chicago to find the real George Kaplan, who he thinks knows what is going on. However, Thornhill realizes that even when he is on the train, he is being chased. However, a beautiful blonde named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is willing to protect him. However, is Thornhill safe with Kendall? Just watch the movie.Like all Hitchcock films, there are hundreds of things that aren't realistic though set in the real world and lots of highly improbable stuff going on everywhere, but if you give it a chance you'll enjoy it and won't care. North By Northwest keeps the winning streak going, and enjoys a well cemented stay in IMDb's Top 50",8,2,5,23 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," Coen Brothers at their best!!!!!
","Bleak drama 'No Country For Old Men' won four Oscars on Sunday, more than any other film, including best movie, director and adapted screenplay for brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.I'm giving this film 9 out of 10 stars, because all the knowledgeable critics say this is a masterpiece, and I am an amateur reviewer with too much time on my hands, so what do I know? I may even post a second review once the dust in my brain settles...No Country lived up to the accolades for the majority of the film, with an unexpected ending that needs some in-depth examination to appropriately digest and appreciate. I intend to watch the film a second time to both enjoy the beautiful west Texas cinematography, top notch acting of Bardem, Jones, and Brolin, as well as concentrate on the implications of the ending.I don't think No Country for Old Men has been released in India. Seems strange ehh? Or have I missed it, I m not quite sure but I managed to download it over the last weekend and see it :-) There is too much happening,a man finds 2 million dollars in the desert, after a drug deal goes wrong. He makes the mistake of going back, and is soon chased by other men who knew about the deal. Now it's a game of cat and mouse between him and a hit-man hired to take him out. Then there is the sheriff who is on their tails. I don't want to give too much away...The Coen Brothers (Ethan Coen & Joel Coen) are back after a long time to the big screen in this intense blood soaked thriller starring Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem in the lead roles and Tommy Lee Jones plays the Sheriff who's seen too much blood shed in his time. All three give stellar performances, but it's Javier who stands out, as the heartless psycho killer on the lose. The intensity in his voice is enough to make you squirm. His portrayal of the assassin looking for the money is frightening and along with Bill from the Kill Bill films, one of the best villains of the past decade. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast, be it seems like no stretch for him.There are bits and pieces of dark humour throughout the film, which is a great way to let you relax after the intense moments that are everything else. Even with the bits of comedy here and there, No Country For Old Men is the most mature piece of work from the Coen Brothers. So confidently directed there is no musical score throughout the film. Instead, we are taken directly into this world. We are no longer watching a film, we are apart of the cat and mouse game. Right from the squeaking of shoes on a tile floor of a man being strangled to the beeping of a transmitter signifying impending doom. There is no need for music, the performance speak for themselves.The Coen Brothers had previously reached a creative peak with Fargo, but No Country for Old Men serves as a new high for the directorial duo, and if Michelangelo can have both the Sistine Chapel and his statue of David, then surely the Coens are entitled to their two masterpieces; the classic Fargo and the modern No Country for Old Men.Other recommended Coen brother movies: Fargo Blood Simple Burn After Reading",9,2,6,28 February 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Best War Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!
","'Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much, my wife is even gonna recognize me whenever it is I get back to her, and how I'll ever be able to, tell about days like today. Ahh, Ryan. I don't know anything about Ryan, I don't care. The man means nothing to me; he's just a name. But if, you know, if going to finding him so he can go home, if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, well then, then that's my mission'I am sure other reviewers who have reviewed 'Saving Private Ryan' (SPR) have rated it as the 'Best War Movie Ever Made'' and I agree. To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg used all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Greatest things about SPR are first of all the sensational, highly awarded and celebrated camera work that actually gives audience the feeling of being in the battlefield too. That's what makes the film such a thrilling, vivid and incredible experience.It puts the the viewer from the comfortable living room chair to 'out there' and puts him/her go through this hell and every nightmarish detail that's part of it. Other marvelous thing is a good story, little extraordinary and different from what the usual war films normally have. That's what keeps the movie interesting all the way.SPR is just outstanding. Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the Normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that. The attack on Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle (notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours). Also one of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. A brilliant innovation is the color reduction (over 50%) which makes you really believe it is 1944. Music is used to great effect in moments of calm. The brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life, yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of Hitler and Nazi ideology.The storyline is a real strength and the characters & acting are superb. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife; only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command. He is well supported by Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who maintains discipline within the squad. But some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one life. Though every man has a mother, you cannot help feel that Ryan (Matt Damon) must be saved out of decency. Ryan himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered 'brothers' in spite of the disaster to befall his family. Finally, 'Steamboat Willie' humanizes the Germans when pleading for his life. Befriended by Upham, he is released, yet returns to battle. His death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in war.Only a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of SPR. Often outnumbered, the Germans conquered most of Europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle, something missing in their clumsy attack on Ramelle. And tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports, so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily. A role for the British was lacking; sadly a Hawker Typhoon could not be used to bomb the Tiger tank. Another historical inaccuracy people have noticed is the Church tower in Ramelle which, according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy but I don't think it will detract from the film. In fact, a good knowledge of WW2 history is important in order to place this film in context. Overall, this tactical and human story within the carnage of WW2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies. And don't miss the message in Captain Miller's last words: 'James... earn this. Earn it.' The question this film poses is: Is it truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person???? This is the same question which Private Reiben asks to Hanks. The whole dialog go like this: Pvt.Reiben: 'You want to explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?'Capt.Miller: 'Anyone wanna answer that?'Medic Wade: 'Hey, Reiben think about the poor bas***d's mother.' Pvt. Reiben: 'Hey, Wade, I got a mother, you got a mother, the sarge has got a mother. S**t, I'll bet that even the Captain's got a mother........ Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have got mothers'You have a great weekend!!!!!!!",8,1,2,28 February 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Million Hearts Won
","To tell you the truth I'm not a big fan of boxing, in fact I think it is basically repugnant sport (if two people trying to brain each other can really be considered a sport). So for this film to win me over, it had to be really special. And it was. One of the reasons for this is that although the film does show the positive aspects of boxing, it doesn't glorify it. You see everything â€“ the glory, the pain, the heartbreak, the feeling of belonging that is all some people have to hold on to. This film takes you on a real roller-coaster of emotion, taking you from the bottom to the top and back again.Million Dollar Baby is the story of a female boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), her trainer Frankieie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), and his sidekick and business partner Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman). If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk to see 'Million Dollar Baby', perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood about boxing after Raging Bulls. But mind you Million Dollar Baby is not a feminist version of Raging Bull, intent on bludgeoning the audience with gritty violence. Nor is it a maudlin rewrite of 'The Champ' or a woman's version of 'Rocky'. Million Dollar Baby is a rhapsody about life, using the harsh world of boxing as a metaphor.In 'Million Dollar Baby,' Frankie is a trainer and manager who never seems to know when to make a move or throw in the towel. He is also the owner of the Hit Pit, a boxing gym where would-be contenders look to flourish under Frankie. The gym manager is one of his former boxers, Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman). After Eddie's career ended, Frankie became less sure of himself as a manager. Eddie tells us, though, that Frankie is the best cut man he's ever seen. Frankie can prepare virtually anyone to get back into the ring between rounds.Enter Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman who squeaks out a living by waiting tables at a local restaurant. She has some street smarts, and some talents using her fists. Her dream is to be a champion female boxer and she knows just the place to practice- the gymnasium operated by Frankie. Maggie wants Frankie to be her coach and her persistence pays off when he finally gives in and agrees to train her in the sport of boxing.What makes this film so entertaining is its winning formula. On every level, this movie succeeds at captivating the audience and making them anticipate the next scene. Here story isn't as predictable as other sports films and many scenes will catch you off guard. A great movie does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft.'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is life about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about.",8,1,1,19 August 2009
Where Eagles Dare," 'Major, you got me as confused as I'll ever be'.
","Where Eagles Dare is a novel by Alistair MacLean a Scottish author who specialized in well-researched, suspenseful war novels. From opening scene to final scene Alistair MacLean's screenplay is a masterpiece of the action genre with a detailed and involving plot that unfolds in a very interesting manner.Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are in terrific form as leaders of a mission deep behind enemy lines. The mission for Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood is to infiltrate the most inaccessible castle in the world to rescue an important American general right from under the noses of the Germans. The only way to get into the castle is via a cable car. Dressed as German soldiers, they... well, I had better leave it at that, otherwise I will give the game away. What they and the audience don't suspect is the number of twists and turns this highly thrilling film will take. Also excellent performances from Michael Hordern as British Vice Adm. Rolland and Derren Nesbitt as Nazi Major von Harpen support the performances of Burton and Eastwood.The cinematography is breathtaking, the snow capped Alps are all around the fortress. The sets are also well made and convincing. The characters are a little shallow, especially the credulity of the Germans, but that is what one would expect in such a far-fetched plot! This movie is about action and adventure! There's also a neat plot twist in store when the commandoes manage to reach the American general -- which leads to yet another twist. The vertigo-inducing climax has made Where Eagles Dare one of the most sought-after of 'early' Eastwood starring features.Where Eagles Dare is one of those war films which have a great deal going for it, although falling into some typical traps. Even so, I found it to be entertaining enough to have watched it on a number of occasions.Some of the action sequences look a little ropey, but generally this is an impressive film of the type they don't make any more, unfortunately.",8,1,2,10 July 2008
Downfall," Serious Movie making!!!
","I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as 'Der Untergang' aka 'The Downfall' did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel's excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler's bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge. We watch Hitler, in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masses. We watch Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. Few films have dared to touch WW2 objectively from a German point of view; Most of the movies are shot and told from the Allied point of view. But this movie is shot completely from the German point of view.'The Downfall' tells the story of Fuhrer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole cityÂ… Based on the book 'Inside Hitler's Bunker' by Joachim Fest. 'The Downfall' is in a word, shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cult so many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SS-Guards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named GruppenfÃ¼hrer Hermann Fegelein , who was Eva Braun's brother-in-law, takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this, he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more, Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military, but of the civilians themselves. As such, his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises, 'In a war as such there are no civilians.' Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz, who appeared in the 2004 remake of 'The Manchurian Candidate.' Ganz captures the movement, voice, even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well, that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is. It is amazing to see how wonderful country like Germany survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. 'The Downfall' is an impressive and brilliant piece of film making and ingenuity. The film is completely in German so do not forget to get a DVD which has English sub titles unless of course you are well versed in German.",8,4,6,21 March 2008
The Green Mile," Miles to go Before Hanks Sleep
","'When I stand before God awaiting judgment and he asks me why I let one of His greatest miracles die, what am I gonna say???? that it was my job?' The Green Mile is not a movie for those looking to fill a couple of hours in meaningless, mindless entertainment. The fireworks and special effects here are scene enhancing, and not the main attraction.The movie is based on a novel by Stephen King (Who also wrote The Shawshank Redemption). While I have not read the novel by King, the movie introduces a fantastical element that ordinarily we wouldn't believe. I believe this film is not a study into miracles, although they occur. It is a study into the meaning of capital punishment and what it means to face death and life with complete knowledge. Choices must be made, sometimes, that stay with us for the rest of our lives. This film leads us through our own experiences and feelings on our own choices.The film appears to begin at the end. Death row, the green mile, Old Smokey, cells filled with men who have been convicted of horrible crimes and are confined here waiting the unavoidable conclusion. It is quite clear that some are guilty and they inspire our feelings of justice. It is clear as well. However, that others may or may not be guilty and inspire in us only pity or sorrow or compassion. It is human, all of it. Sick, well, giant, mousey. Good and evil. If you let it, it will make you think and it may even change your life.Tom Hanks shows once again why he is arguably the most celebrated actor of all times. Hanks tells his saga as an old man. Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb who is the chief guard in Louisiana State Prison's death row. Part of his job is to supervise the executions of the prisoners waiting to walk 'the last mile', in this case called the 'green mile' because of the lime green tiles that cover the floor of the prison. I hate people who give away too much of a movie in reviews so I never do that in my reviews and in this case I am tempted to tell you more but I feel those of you who haven't seen it I'll be spoiling it all for you....I have been inspired by movies in my life, but this is the first movie that I have watched where when the credits rolled I had an immediate insight into my own spiritual existence. This movie will make viewers think about their attitudes, spiritual integrity, and overall meaning for existence.Also be prepared for graphic death scenes, racial hate, moderate depictions of violence against children, slight foul language and no 'everybody lives happily ever after' ending. Some do, some don't. That's life.",8,1,2,28 February 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Silence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","At times it seems that there aren't words to describe 'The Silence of the Lambs', it truly is an endurance trial of the mind. The film is dark and psychologically disturbing throughout while also dealing with issues of sexism and strength. Director Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel swept across the globe in 1991, eventually winning five Academy Awards and becoming a prestigious topic of discussion among critics.Its moody influence crept across the popular 90s sub-genre of 'serial-thriller'. This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller of horror ike capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?) that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.The movie starts with Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is an FBI trainee, being called up from her classes to acquire information from a serial killer, Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), about a current killer known as Buffalo Bill. Bill is a man who wishes to be a transsexual but has been turned down for sex reassignment because of his volatility. Starling acquires a sort of cordial relationship with Lecter, who wishes her to divulge personal information about herself in return for his assistance with the case. The film is tense throughout. Scott Glenn turns in a pretty good performance as a director of the FBI division that Starling is entering. Lecter is chilling as he gives Starling information about Buffalo Bill and the Senator's daughter who has been kidnapped by Bill. The film is extremely suspenseful, I felt like yelling at the screen to tell me what was going to happen next. The suspense is most definitely on account of the film's taking you through out the twists and turns of your own psyche.The acting is one of the most crucial aspects of the film. Since the film only revolves around a few characters a big cast of mixed stars in not necessary. Instead, the quality over quantity formula works exceptionally well. Anthony Hopkins got best actor award despite being confined to only seventeen minutes of screen time. He does his best in every scene and practically pours his heart as he makes such a realistic and haunting performance.However Hannibal would obviously be a complete waste without Jodie Foster giving an equally impressive performance. She has a nice south American accent with a good amount of innocence to her. She is desperate to find Bill but has a weird relationship with Hannibal along the way. Ted Levine is the last major character in this film and probably the whole reason why everything happens. He doesn't have much screen time but still manages to put on a creepy and believable performance. He is somewhat humorous but still manages to remain sinister.The Silence of the lambs works for a lot of factors. The cast plays a big part and so is the mood, setting, and cinematography. The movie is very dark most of the time and the cinematography complements this perfectly. The detail to the scenes works well as the setting is creepy and suspenseful. Hannibal's jail cells are nicely designed and contain a lot of aspects that show his character nicely. The movie keeps an excellent balance of suspense and drama. It is suspenseful throughout but has a nice dramatic element that is lacking in many films today. The climax is pulse pounding and the film has excellent closure that has it come full circle.Even the DVD cover scares me. I would NOT recommend this for children obviously!!!!",8,0,2,21 March 2008
