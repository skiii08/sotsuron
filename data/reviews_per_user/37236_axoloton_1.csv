The Blair Witch Project," Boring, hyped piece of rubbish
","I'm glad I never spent a dime seeing this movie. At the time, it had so much merchandising that it ringed my inner 'they-spend-too-much-money-in-marketing-so-it-must-suck' bell. And I was right.When I finally got to see the Blair Witch Project, first I started with a healthy curiosity - that turned to total boredom after the first 10 minutes of seeing some stupid brats running in circles through the woods. Scary? not at all. Plain and boring story. But great marketing.Unless you're a teenager who get scared easily, don't watch this movie. Because this is the kind of movie you endure through it, the kind of movie that make you feel that someone is ripping your arms off.",1,19,36,27 June 2008
