Scarface," I might be hated for this...
","OK here we go...This is easily the most over rated movie in history. I truly don't understand why people really enjoy this one. It is such a slow moving plot. If you want to see this..change your mind. If you do actually waste your time putting this in your DVD player just skip to the end because that is the only good part. Pacino did a good job as a mafia man..he should thats all he ever does. Maybe its just me but this movie is a complete waste of 3 hours. I do think it should be re-made because if you put Martin Scorsese in the directors chair it can be done a lot better. It needs a modern day flare on it. I don't know who should play Tony because Pacino is too old now. There are a couple people I have in mind, one of them is Johnny Depp who is arguably one of the greatest this business has ever seen..and if you have seen Donnie Brasco then you know it can be done by him. The other one would be Edward Norton, he is another one of the greats and can do anything. Those are the only two I think are capable.",2,8,15,20 June 2007
