Walk the Line," Wonderfully entertaining and emotionally heartbreaking
","Walk the Line is a wonderfully entertaining and an emotionally heartbreaking experience. Be prepared to want to sing along, laugh, cry, worry and rejoice. You can't help but to be completely absorbed by this story. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon sparkles as June Carter. Together, they are the perfect on- screen match. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good movies. I have always been a fan of biographical movies that are well done, written and visually. Walk the Line has become one of my favorites, as it accomplishes to deeply keep the viewer engaged and tell one hell of a story.",9,0,0,27 February 2006
