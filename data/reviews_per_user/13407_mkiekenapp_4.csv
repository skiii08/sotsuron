It," Lacking tension and fear
","Like many who have reviewed this movie, I too have the same complaints. The movies falls extremely short of the book in regards of a suspense or a thriller. One begins to question did anyone from the writers to the director ever read the source material. Hell even watching the original movie might of helped. Bill Skarsg√§rd was going to have a tough challenge ahead of him to even come close to Tim Curry's performance. Anyone would. He just doesn't project the creepy, scary, edge of your seat performance. The kids in the movie have been written to be more like the kids from Stranger Things then the kids from Derry, ME.",4,1,3,14 May 2018
Last Flag Flying," Touching to ones that been there.
","This movie sadly touches on the emotions of ones that sadly have gone thru this personally. The struggle of why, the battle of if you are doing the right thing. The laughter of recalling the fun moments of your loved one taken from you to soon. It draws generations of servicemen together that it maybe a different war but, the same thoughts, fear, experiences and raw emotion are all the same. It touches so many sadly this story. Even worse so few will get the true meaning of this story.",10,1,3,12 September 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," If you love CGI this one for you.
","This movie is filled with CGI effects. If you love that sort of movie then by all means this is right up alley. Looking for a movie that has a great story and brings new life to this series then you are sadly mistaken. It lakes a great story. There is one there but, have to use special effects in order to tell it. Sad that a once decent series has come down to this. Two movies to many I'm afraid. Time to truly let this franchise sink to the bottom never to be seen again. PLEASE.",5,1,1,19 April 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Just painful
","I do wanted to love this or even like it. Some movies just need to never be remade and should never become life action. If it was taken from the Broadway musical then it would have a chance. Sadly it just struggles to find its place between the musical and the animated movie. It fall short of either of those. The CGI shortly into the movie just becomes painful and hard to take. It's over done. Yes it's hard to make life action talking kitchen utensils or talking clocks. But, at least try not to make it look like a few life action people in a CGI world.",4,0,0,19 April 2018
