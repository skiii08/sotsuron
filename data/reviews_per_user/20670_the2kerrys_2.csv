Requiem for a Dream," Good - but not an entertainer.
",The movie is a GOOD movie - but certainly not entertaining. The three main lives as story lines run in parallel like three trains racing each other.Ellen Burstyn plays the mum so well I reckon she should get some award somewhere...To see the results of home-stay domestic as well as the street culture drug {ab}use was well handled and a new experience for me to observe. { obviously I mix in the wrong circles --- eh? }Kerry#1 of the2kerrys=Kerrykins,Null,0,0,2 March 2001
Flight," Deceptive Advertising
","Hi from Australia. DownUnder we have section 52 of the trade practices act which forbids deceptive or misleading advertising. My gripe? The trailer of the movie seemed to present a drama. There was no hint of the 'normalisation' of cocaine use during the movie.As parents we took our 16 year old daughter to see, what appeared to be, a great movie. I'm not a prude BUT there are things I do NOT wish to have normalised for my kids. Hopefully others agree before they spend their money. Someone needs to have their bot-om kicked.Great acting but questionable content.Thumbs down from Oz. A great story sullied by something unnecessary.",3,0,4,17 February 2013
