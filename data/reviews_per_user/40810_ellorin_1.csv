Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," If you didn't like 'Wanted' you won't like this
","This director seems like he is going to be a very one dimensional director. Try to use unrealistic stylized action. Some movies have been able to pull this off but others such as this one just can't do it. There really is not much good in this film. The acting was sub-par, story was bad, special effects were not all that great either. It would seem this director can't make a movie with a big budget. Needs to go back to making indie low budget films. Seems he was better at that. Say like 'Night Watch'. And as far as the story goes I am all about Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter. But in this film even that got screwed up. Not even sure this is a film that I could recommend for someone to rent from a kiosk for a dollar. Sadly I spent over 10 on this pile of steaming debris!",1,15,31,26 June 2012
