The Avengers," The Avengers review
","The first big live-action superhero team-up movie, The Avengers is a truly epic film. There are many great fight scenes and a smart, interesting villain. The flaws in this movie are there because MCU producers are still experimenting with hero interactions and relationships.",9,1,1,24 April 2019
