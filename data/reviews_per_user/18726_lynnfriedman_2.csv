Changeling," Irony, Metaphor & Denial
","Another bleak, compelling, true story from the past.Clint Eastwood directs pouty-lipped & fashionable working single mom Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) as she devotes her life to the return of her kidnapped son. Fans of the current political corruption cases will enjoy the irony popping up all over the place in this tale of 1940s Los Angeles political machine corruption. If this wasn't a true story you could never believe that this happened.The poor mom's son is finally returned to her, only problem is he isn't her child. So does everyone say we're sorry madam, we'll keep looking for your son, oh noooooo. They try to convince Mrs Collins she must be mistaken, and when she persists they try to convince her she is crazy, going so far as to lock her up in the nut house along with several obviously intelligent, sane women who had the bad sense to cross some man in authority. I swear this film is a metaphor for all the denial we put ourselves through to survive our dysfunctional times.",Null,0,0,2 June 2012
Rush," Not Just Cars Driving in Circles
","Just look at that face on the poster. Who cares if the film looks like it's about men in fast cars going around in a circle? This is the perfect date movie. You have both action and meaningful dialog. RUSH tells the true story of the inexplicably long rivalry between two race car drivers in the 1970s. We follow Mr Hunk (James Hunt), and Mr Rat Face (Niki Lauda) as they fight to maintain their first place Grand Prix title from each other.Thank the heavens this isn't a 3D movie, the action was intense enough. RUSH goes deep into the weighty topics of life. You will find your brain grappling with the meaning of friendship, ambition, even marriage. We watch Hunt and Lauda mature and adjust their priorities in life. Well at least Lauda does. Chris Hemsworth, playing James Hunt looks every bit the Bad Boy with boundless energy for women, booze, drugs, and looking death in the eye with every race. Daniel Br√ºhl plays the contradictory Niki Lauda, equally motivated to win, but by his own strict set of rules calculated to avoid death.As the story unfolds we meet girlfriends, managers, drivers, investors and assorted 1970s stereotypes that serve to flesh out the incalculable motivations and pressures involved in keeping the show on the road. Everyone has something to lose. Niki learns that happiness is the enemy. 'It means you have something to lose.' James seems to be suppressing his thoughts and feeling throughout the film with his physicality.Trust me, RUSH is, well, a rush. (impulse control issues)",9,2,3,25 September 2013
