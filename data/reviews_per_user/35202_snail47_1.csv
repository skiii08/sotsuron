The Blair Witch Project," Scary????? Not quite.
","This movie was really terrible.  I have never been more disappointed in 'hype' in all my life.  Not only was this movie not scary, it wasn't even good.  The only thing I was scared of was that I was going to vomit from motion sickness right in the middle of the theater.",1,0,2,31 July 1999
