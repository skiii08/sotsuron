Hereditary," First review, disappointing film
","I was recommended this by a film going friend, saw reviews and thought 'let's go! Must be worth a watch'Wrong, in most waysStarts off ok, drags in the middle, gets interesting again, and the ending....??? What. The. Fluff",4,3,6,16 June 2018
Captain Marvel," A little GOTG, with more Earth
","Fairly good story, interesting main character, good chemistry between Jackson and Larson. A few doses of 90's nostalgia, and the usual Marvel wit. Not a classic, but a good addition to the Marvel movie universe",7,1,5,8 March 2019
