The Sound of Music," One of the best musicals I've ever seen.
","The Sound of Music is my favorite movie of all time. In front of the television in my living room, I grew up with the majesty of the Alps, splendor of the Aigen Von Trapp family home and the beauty of a family falling in love with their governess Maria. The real-life story of the Von Trapp family was portrayed through the phenomenal acting by many iconic names in Hollywood. The main character, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is introduced to her audience as a postulant at an Austrian abbey. Maria realizes the abbey is not a good fit for her as her overseer Mother Abbess, Peggy Wood, decides to send her to work as a governess for Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp, Christopher Plummer, and his seven rambunctious children. The acting, directing, music, cinematography, costume design and historical significance combine to produce the greatest musical of all time.The musical is almost three hours long, but the superb acting will make you lose track of time. Maria soon forms a bond with the children as she teaches them about song, and most importantly how music can affect your daily lives. Maria and the children's bond and friendship grows strong, but Maria and the Captain soon begin to fall for one another. Another woman, Baroness Elsa Schraeder, played by Eleanor Parker, tries to get in the way. True love triumphs in the end, as Maria brings a joyless household together and gives the Von Trapp family a home. When everything seems to be a happy ending, the Nazis seize control of Vienna and the Von Trapp family must escape or the father will be forced to be commissioned in the Third Reich.
The Sound of Music was directed like watching painting come to life. The director, Robert Wise, was able to beautifully bring different elements, neutral colors and soft tones into each scene, engulfing the viewer. Some argue that some scenes are too drawn out, giving too much to the audience, when a little less could be shown and would make the scene flow smoother, but I disagree. This story is one that deserves to be taken in moment by moment and not to be rushed.The cinematography in this movie is stunning, with countryside views of Austria, beautiful European city streets, majestic mountains everywhere you look, and shots of the Villa Trapp, the real-life home of the Von Trapp family.Costume design was done amazingly well, from authentic ballroom dresses and tuxes to the play clothes made from curtains. Design in film is always something I'm critiquing. It's one of the most important elements to place the viewer in simply a good story or bring you directly into that reality. The colors and patterns of the clothes are incorporated as part of the overall mood. The designers researched the trends and styles of that decade and made the movie come alive.Throughout the movie the foreshadowing does not quite prepare the audience of the horror that Austria is about to face. The Third Reich is about to take over Austria and Captain Von Trapp and his associates continually discuss the changes that they are happening. The last act is where the Von Trapp family must flee their home and country. Here the film switches mood completely, once light-hearted and lively now to suspenseful and wary. Some viewers find the pacing of the film difficult, even confusing. The drastic change is appropriate for what was happening to many Austrian families at this time. The Sound of Music is based on a true story and real life rarely has just happy endings.If getting catchy songs in your head isn't your cup of tea with jam and bread, I would suggest to keep looking. But if you want to get caught up in a wonderful story told through mesmerizing scenes of song and laughter. Like me, you have found the movie musical for you! It 'Trapps' me every time I watch it! A movie that has something for everyone, a true masterpiece, the Sound of Music!",10,0,0,22 January 2020
