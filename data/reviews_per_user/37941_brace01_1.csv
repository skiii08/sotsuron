The Avengers," 3D effects were great but plot was lacking
","The 3D effects in the movie were second to none but the 'story' consisted of mainly just conflict after conflict. There was nothing truly intelligent about the plot or any of the twists. It is worth watching to see the effects, especially Iron Man flying around. They did a great job of making you feel like you were in the action.I'm disappointed with the IMDb rating and feel that the studios are now finding ways to game the ratings system by adding a bunch of paid propaganda. IMDb used to be my go to site but with how high this movie is rated I feel I need to find another site that is more accurate. IMDb used to be SPOT ON but obviously they are selling out for ad revenue!",5,16,33,8 June 2012
