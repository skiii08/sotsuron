Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you didn't get it, it wasn't for you.
","The biggest complaint about this movie is that it's aimed at children--anyone who believes Star Wars is for adults is kidding themselves.
The movie begins with an opening scroll that sets up the plot (in a similar fashion to most of the comics I own). Following which we are introduced to two Jedi Knights, who (according to the opening scroll) are 'the guardians of peace and justice.' Their arch nemesis' are, an Evil Lord named 'Sidious' (who basically wants to take over the galaxy in the name of evil) and a pure-evil, satanic-looking, humanoid named Darth Maul who wants 'revenge.'Is this all purely for children? Of course it is! But what could possibly be more fun?Through it all we are lead (by a very cool Liam Neeson) through underwater bubble-cities, desert planets and the galactic senate. Where we; meet a very large variety of over the top characters, see some of the greatest visuals ever put to film and enjoy some extremely exciting action sequences.
And after all of this most people are complaining that it's too much of a kid's film. A movie should be judged by how well it achieved what it intended, not by the popularity of what it intended.",10,0,0,27 July 1999
