The Pianist," fantastic, excellent and emotional
","i like history, world war movies most,, always when i searched about best world war 2 or holocaust movies this movies was always in top 10. so i had a curiosity from a long time about this movie. now today i watch this movie. and i would like to say this is excellent movie on world war 2 events.this movie has everything. holocaust horror, emotions etc.. this movie is mainly not about holocaust or world war. it is just on a one man, how he survive in that cruel event with the help of known or unknown peoples even a Nazi officer. there are many time i cried while watching this movie.mainly on some food scenes, when people and protagonist was fighting with hunger. then in last i compare this movie with Schindler's list. and i will give this movie 2nd stand , because schindlers's list has greater emotions, dialogues etc. also a great music... even today when i listen main theme of that movie i feel a pain in my heart. unfortunately this movie lack this,otherwise this is a great movie and now it is in my collection",10,0,0,6 August 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," most stylish action movie of year, but have some weak points
","this movie is no doubt the most stylish movie of year, it has good action, dialogue , costumes and fight scene. the only weak points i have noticed that they showed killing very over dramatic. he looks like an immortal man. otherwise it is watchable movie. and the other thing i don't understand that why Winston was helping him?",10,0,2,9 June 2017
