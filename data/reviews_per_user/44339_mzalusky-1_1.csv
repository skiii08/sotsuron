","I have seen this movie 2/3 times. I just finished it again. Every time its on I just cant look away, it grabs you and holds you forever frozen in 9/11 again. Im very passionate and its make me know that there are people out there that will fight for freedom. This movie makes no judgments AT ALL. It tells the story,period. You can see passion in the terrorists eyes just as much as the passengers. It shows that in different cultures we are all the same when it comes down to our beliefs. What a movie EVERYONE MUST see this movie. I will show it to my grandchildren(older) when they ask what happen that terrible day the earth stood still.",10,3,6,7 February 2008
