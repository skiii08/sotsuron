Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," New Episode is both good and bad
","The critics seem to hate it.  The fans seem to love it, for the most part. It is definitely worth the price of admission, but does it live up to all of the pre-release hype?The answer is no, it doesn't.  It had some major flaws, including too many fake backgrounds, not enough interesting dialogue, and Jar Jar Binks. Adults seem to despise his speech and clumsy perfomance.  I have to agree. He was funny, but really annoying. This isn't a Disney movie. I couldn't understand what he was saying.The battle scenes, the light-saber battles, and the race were great.  That is what makes an epic Lucas Arts production.  I wish it had more of it. The droids were not as interesting as the storm troopers of the Empire. They seem to go down like dominoes.  I wanted more interplanetary action, not just Naboo, Tatooine, and the Jedi planet.  Speaking of which, the 12 Jedi council was uninteresting.  Yoda didn't look as real as he did in Episode 5. Samuel Jackson and Darth Maul's dialogue wasn't enough.  How are we to loathe Darth Maul if looks so cool and doesn't speak?Yet, the movie had its high points. It helps explain the history of the Empire and the Republic.  The graphics were great, just over used.  The music built up the suspense.  I will go see it again.It just needed to be pre screened and updated first.  It seems like a rough draft, not a final draft. George, you should have made it into a PG movie!",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
