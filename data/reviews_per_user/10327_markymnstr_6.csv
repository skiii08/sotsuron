Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I Bought a Ticket and I was Punk'd
","A friend of mine took the time to share his delight with a pre-screening he viewed of Borat. It's currently getting a 96% positive feedback from the critics. This was an unequivocal 'must-see' this weekend for me. All I can say is, 'I'm feeling pretty lonely right now.'You talk about being out of sync. Most of the Borat audience in which my wife and I attended was hysterical with laughter, and yet I found myself pretty much bored, offended or otherwise turned off by much of the movie. A touch of vulgarity, and a sprinkle of crude can spice up a movie effectively, but after about fifteen or twenty minutes in, my overload button was already beeping with an endless onslaught of 'poop,' masturbation, urination, rape, Jew & gay jokes. A very MTV/Punk'd tone to it. For me, mildly amusing, occasionally insightful, but way too concerned with shocking the audience into uncomfortable laughter. Kind of lonely way out here all by my lonesome self. Definitely showing my age on this one. My new nickname, '4% Minority.'",4,6,13,6 November 2006
Crash," The Truth Hurts Only When It Should!
","Paul Haggis pulls back the veil of hypocrisy in an effort to reveal that all species human, regardless of their class, status or skin hue possess varied levels of racism that almost always seem to find their way to the surface in times of crisis.The movie pulls no punches, but I for one, though at times felt shaken up never felt beaten up. At times felt saddened, but never felt abandoned. If Haggis was preaching, it wasn't brimstone and hellfire, and it certainly wasn't to the choir. It was more like a modern book of 'Revelations,' and either you get it or you don't! Painful? Sometimes. But almost always poignant and often surprisingly funny, Haggis makes certain no one escapes his magnifying glass. At times the malevolence that spews from the lips of Sandra Bullock (The DAs wife) or Shaun Toub (The Persian shop owner) is brutal and is deliberately exceedingly uncomfortable. But for Haggis it's like a detox program on the road to recovery.The tapestry is woven with purpose and coincidence that may preach and pound but it never hems or haws or equivocates. It's the kind of film that tries to prove that an audience 'can handle the truth' (sorry Jack!).L.A. is a cultural melting pot and serves perfectly as an authentic backdrop for the movie's message and tone. Here Haggis paints a cinematic mural of his City of Angels. A city of hate, hope and redemption.In my opinion, 'Crash' is never bleak, just refreshingly honest. It's funny, sad, poignant and finally, in its own way...healing.",10,4,10,20 June 2005
Gran Torino," You think you know Clint Eastwood, think again.
","Clint Eastwood has a way of redefining genres. What his unforgettable Unforgiven did for westerns, Gran Torino very well may do for dramas. He loves to head fake his audience as he cleverly sidesteps stereotypical characters and concepts. You think you know Clint Eastwood, think again.This isn't Dirty Harry or Josey Wales, nor is it Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. This is come to expect the unexpected 21st century Clint Eastwood. Like a vintage wine, he keeps getting better with age. And like the Gran Torino in 'Gran Torino' this is a modern day classic that glistens in the sun.Without giving away too much let me just say be prepared to laugh your ass off, repeatedly throughout most of the movie. And then be ready to stand up and applaud when he head fakes you again at the end. And then just smile and shake your head as he sings us through the credits.One of the better flicks of the year.",9,4,8,17 December 2008
Up," Pixar the 'Emperor With No Clothes'?
","I'm sure for the handful of people that read this I'm going to probably get a 0 out of 12 found this review helpful. It seems, almost without exception that positive reviews are deemed helpful but negative ones are not.With that said, I felt this was one of the most disappointing, if not the most disappointing Pixar film yet. The story was obviously pieced together almost as an after thought. It was flawed, and at times preposterous.First, what I liked. The opening 15 minutes. When the young boy and girl met, fell in love, grew old together, and then...well then the rest of the movie happens. Also, very much enjoyed the little boy scout character.Again, a spoiler alert is called for here. In the opening scene, Carl Frederickson, the 78 year old hero of the story, is a little boy watching a newsreel in a movie theater of his hero, an intrepid adventurer who travels the world in his airship (blimp). Jump forward seventy years later and our 78 year old hero runs into his hero, at least thirty years his senior and the hero looks and acts like a man in his late 50s or early 60s. I mean, Please! Then, the dogs. Oh yes, those cutified, electronic collar talking dogs. Are you kidding me? Who came up with that idea? Ugh!!! We know the idea of 'Up' came from the Japanese masterpiece 'Howl's Moving Castle.' But how that could have a rating on IMDb of 8.1 and 'Up' a rating of 9.1 just boggles this person's mind.",6,9,20,5 June 2009
There Will Be Blood," Beautiful ugly...
","As enthralling as the first half hour was the last 30 minutes was so authentically ugly that I actually left the theater feeling dark and muddied! The movie was poignant, penetrating and profound driven by a breathtakingly flawless performance by Daniel-Day Lewis. Yet, in my opinion, the movie wasn't perfect like so many have written here.Lewis' sidekick partner was virtually missing in action through most of the story, and that left a serious void. And, the metamorphic transformation of Daniel-Day's character, from an angry, layered, pained soul to the personification of human evil left me a little confused, if not disturbed.Daniel-Day Lewis should win best actor, but this film SHOULD NOT win best picture. That should go to Michael Clayton or No Country For Old Men.",8,0,4,24 January 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Smart, intuitive, unpredictable and refreshing.
","Danny Boyle goes to India. This is one helluva director who really likes to play the gamut. From 'Trainspotting' to 'Millions'. From '28 Days Later' to 'Slumdog Millionaire'. The only thing any of these movies have in common is they're extraordinary works of film-making that both critics and consumers seem to love. And you won't find a blockbuster among them, and you probably never will from Mr. Boyle. But the lack of box office recognition will probably be the last thing on Boyle's mind come award season when 'Slumdog Millionaire' predictably becomes an Academy Award sleeper. Is it that good? You betcha! The style, the substance, the tone, the story all scream wow! And all defy description. It's a heart wrenching, gut wrenching, heart tugging, heart warming, soul searching, spirit lifting, epic drama that is as much romantic as it is harrowing, as suspenseful as it is funny.Slumdog is the name attached to orphans that grow up in the human cesspool of Mumbai India that somehow manage to survive much like poly wags would in stagnant pools of waste back here in America. Against all odds. Miracle against miracle, this slumdog grows into a smart, streetwise young man, who makes it onto India's version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' And...well, without spoiling the film, all I'll say is 'he doesn't.' 'Want to be a millionaire, that is.' Smart, intuitive, unpredictable and refreshing. With a Hollywood ending that's only succeeded by it's Bollywood ending. Is this one of my favorite movies of the year? You betcha! The film's location and occasional use of subtitles will dampen it's overall appeal. But this should find a very loyal and enthusiastic following on DVD and Blu Ray.",9,2,7,6 December 2008
