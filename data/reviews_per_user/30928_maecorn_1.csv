The Hangover," Great mixture but not a milestone
","A great movie, good comedy, with fun and laughter, with drugs and dough, with obscenity and perversion, with a light and harmless storyline. A great mixture of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and some Guy Richie imitation. Expect no deep emotions, no love line, it's a film to watch with friends and beer.The story is strong with a retrograde mapping of the happenings, but has nothing new to say, neither has this way of decoding the confusion some newish style. It is a simply watchable movie, with a 'don't expect a ka-boom at the end' ending. Once is enough.What really impresses is the cut and rhythm of the movie. It is well balanced, no real slopes and hills, just evenly tense till the end.There is one scene that had some sort of introducing function, a nice idea: after drinking JÃ¤germeister and forgetting the whole blood-brotherhood crap from Brother Alan, they raise their glasses to Cheers, than the camera swings on to the Vegas horizon showing the accelerated dawn behind the skyline. Let's the story begin!!! Harmonic few seconds...The characters, especially Alan are lovable, not to mention here, that the actors appeared until now in low-budget, somehow neglected films, which gives some extra taste and virginity to the film and the evolution of the characters.Summarized up I can only tell You, watch this film, it's worth. But keep in mind this won't alter the ways of movie-making in the future....at least in my opinion. Enjoy!",7,1,2,24 August 2009
