Hereditary," Nope. Don't know how it got so much hype.
","First off I hate movies that don't clearly explain what is going on in the end. Cliffhangers are fine, but where you leave the movie with more questions than answers it's just garbage. It wasn't scary. They tried to get a shock factor in there by having a bunch of naked people at the end standing around. It was unessasary and confusing. I had friends say it was so crazy good and that it was so good. Far from it. It was awful. I'm sorry just the truth.",1,2,8,17 September 2019
