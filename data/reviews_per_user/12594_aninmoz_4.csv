Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good family action entertainer
","I have never been a great fan of space movies as I find the weird faces and clownish attires rather repulsive. However, it was recommended to me by a french student who came to visit my college in very strong terms. And luckily it was shown on television within a few days and I think the movie was fun and interesting, if not 'good' in the sense of direction and acting. I think it is very well made and at least the children are sure to like it. The 'natural' emotions of the unnatural characters were particularly appealing and the setting of the scenes very excellent. However, there is nothing special about performance of the actors. To end, I would say it is a nice family entertainer and not one which would leave a mark on you but you will not get bored during the movie.",9,14,20,10 January 2002
Unbreakable," one of the best that I have seen
","I went with a lot of apprehension as to how this movie would be after hearing of the rather odd story. However, I returned home a happy man as the movie had an aura about it which created some strange feelings of happiness in me. I would not like to give out anything to those who have not seen it. I would however recommend everyone to see it as soon as possible if they haven't- it will be one of the most spiritually enriching experiences of your life.",9,0,0,10 June 2001
Taxi Driver," one of the biggest trash of all time
","Well there are few movies that you regret ever watching them and certainly taxi driver will be one of them to me. I was 'forced' to watch this movie due to its fame, the caste and a excellent trailer shown in AXN ( where I watched the movie eventually ). I was shocked to see an actor of the calibre of Robert De Niro wasted his time in producing such trash. If you wish to bore somebody to death, my advice would be to ask that person to watch this movie.",1,29,78,10 January 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," one of the best of all time
","Well the first impression from any trailer will be that the movie consists of just pure action and nothing else. But when I saw it for the first time I was proved wrong, and ever since I see it almost once every two months and I don't get bored at all. Being directed by one of the greatest of all time, I don't need to add any more adournments to the movie.",10,1,1,3 September 2001
