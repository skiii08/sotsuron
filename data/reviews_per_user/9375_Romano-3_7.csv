The Blair Witch Project," Extraordinary First Effort
","Few films can live up to such hype.  But then again, you don't go to a college basketball game and expect to see Michael Jordan on the court. Considering the budget and the experience of the film makers, Blair Witch represents an extraordinary accomplishment.Rating:  78%",7,1,1,2 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Overcome Your Misplaced Feelings of Cultural Superiority and See This Film
","I saw this film with our movie group.  Several thought it was a strange choice, and some commented 'its not my humor', but before it was over - everyone broke out laughing during South Park.  Those who overcame timidity and feelings of cultural superiority were treated to an unforgettable comic experience. It is an intelligent satire presented in the most profane possible way.  The film is not for those easily offended and it is unfortunate that South Park will not be seen by more people.  Not only very funny, but also worth seeing twice. Rating:  84%",8,0,0,27 July 1999
Notting Hill," Humorous, light and fun.
","A film that works.  Not as funny or as memorable, in its entirety, as Four Weddings and a Funeral (the comparison is inevitable given the film's background).  However, the passage of time sequence in which Hugh Grant walks through the seasons is a magical touch, and Rhys Ifans, playing Hugh Grant's house-mate Spike, is a standout.",8,0,0,29 June 1999
American Pie," It has been a long time since I've heard an audience continuously erupt in laughter as it did during American Pie in the Upper West Side last night.
","This film had us laughing from the beginning to the end.  In fact, out of all the films we have seen this year, including Analyze This and Election (both very good), American Pie is the funniest hands down.  Not as clever as Election, but hysterically funny.  Jason Biggs (Jim), Chris Klein (Oz) and Eugene Levy (Jim's father), were particularly good.",9,0,0,12 July 1999
American Beauty," The best new film I've seen since Pulp Fiction.
","Romano Rating:  95%As a mainstream studio release, American Beauty sets a new standard for originality in screen writing and cinematic excellence.  The characters in Sam Mendes' film are fresh, complex and real.  'Look closer', indeed - the audience is drawn into the film almost immediately.  The Alan Ball script is so strong that even the image of a bag blowing in the wind is completely captivating - not once, but twice.American Beauty celebrates life amidst adversity with a boldness similar to that found in Life is Beautiful.  Visually, it is in the same innovative league as the recent Run Lola Run.  American Beauty has the emotional content and power that was missing from Eyes Wide Shut.After already establishing himself as an extraordinary actor in Swimming with Sharks, the Usual Suspects, and Seven; after redefining a classic role in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh on Broadway earlier this year; Kevin Spacey's performance in American Beauty somehow manages to raise the bar of excellence even higher.   He may not have received a Tony Award in 1999, but as far as I'm concerned, the upcoming Oscar for Best Actor might as well be given to Kevin Spacey right now.  Annette Bening also gives the performance of her career. Best Line:  `Never underestimate the power of denial.'",10,0,0,21 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Unforgettable but laborious
","An uneven result ... but a thought-provoking overall product.  Excellent performances by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. There are several scenes and images in this film that are difficult to forget.  BUT, the film is sloppily edited and it would be a chore to sit through another entire screening.
Alan Cumming gives a terrific performance as the hotel bellhop.",8,0,1,19 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," One of the best American films of the year.
","Romano Rating:  90%Thought-provoking and moving, one of those rare films that merits a second viewing.  M. Night Shyamalan's writing and directing are brilliant.  It is rare that a film engages your mind while shocking your senses.  The images of The Sixth Sense stay with you long after the screening.  Bruce Willis is effectively restrained and Toni Collette is outstanding as Cole's mother. One of the best American films of the year.Best Part:  The performance of Haley Joel Osment as young Cole.",9,0,0,30 August 1999
