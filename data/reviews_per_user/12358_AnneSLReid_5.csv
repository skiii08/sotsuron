The Ring," Modern horror at its best
","After watching so many diabolical let-downs (House on Haunted Hill and Ghost Ship for a start!), it was so refreshing to finally find a modern horror film that is actually scary!  Indeed, not only did I revert to a silly wimpy 7-year-old - sleeping in the lounge with the light on for 2 weeks - but I also found it impossible to stop thinking about this film!This film worked very well for me, but I can understand why so many viewers thought it was poor.  I saw this version before watching the Japanese one or reading the book.  Indeed, neither film is very close to the book, which is a shame as I thought it was very good.  However, after seeing the Western version and knowing what the concept was all about, I thought the Japanese version was dull, slow and an anti-climax, mainly because the film was so dark I couldn't see it and because the special effects were rubbish. Indeed, Rick Baker made a much better job, which, ultimately, saved the film from being a potential farce.  However, had I seen the Japanese film first, I would probably be championing that instead!The black-and-white film quality and eerie sound effects maintained suspense right through the film.  My only complaint would be the decision to cast Dorfman as the 'cute' kid, who looked more like the scary midget in 'Don't Look Now'!Action-packed from the start, intelligent and original with fine performances from Watts, Henderson (come a long way since Shortland Street!), and especially Cox, this is a masterpiece of modern horror.",Null,1,1,16 September 2003
The Others," Macabre but not frightening
","Like I always do, I see films like this one trailered and I rush to the cinema in the vain hope that I'll be frightened out of my socks, ignoring the little voice in the back of my head that says 'it will be a let down'. Well this time, I wasn't frightened, but the little voice was also wrong! More of a psychological thriller than a horror (wrongly hyped), the characterisation in the film was so incredible that I stopped caring whether or not the film was chilling.This is Kidman's finest role I have seen to date and I have always been a fan of her acting.  Her accent was brilliant and her portrayal of a strict, principled mother who is ultimately the most vulnerable person in that house is mesmerising.  Of course, the unique relationship with her children could not have been adequately portrayed without the fantastic performances from Mann and Bentley.  Altogether, the characters were realistic, funny and sympathetic.Ultimately, this film was predictable, but it was more complex than a cheesy one-dimensional horror.  That is not to say that the film did not have its chilling moments, such as when Mann is possessed by the medium (or vice versa), but it drew its suspense from the emotional rather than the visual.A fine film with unique individuality and intelligence.",Null,0,0,16 September 2003
Casualties of War," One of De Palma's best
","This is a highly stimulating film which challenges all the traditional notions of morality - when does a victim become a perpetrator?  How far can we excuse people's behaviour because of circumstance?  Ultimately, De Palma tries to show that during war, the line between baddies and goodies is not as clear cut as we would believe.The theme is totally centred around Penn and Fox, the former being the ostensible 'baddie' - a common, sadistic, murderer of an innocent Vietnamese girl, but who is the best soldier of his platoon and whose bravery at the beginning of the film saves Fox's life.  He is admired only in the field, outside of which he is a common, unsavoury nobody.  After losing his friend to the VietCong, Penn savagely rapes a girl, whose only crime was to be associated with the villagers who harboured the VietCong.  He then manipulates his henchmen to kill her - being too cowardly to do it himself. The line between grief and recklessness, understandable in wartime, and pure sadism becomes blurred.   It is difficult to believe that the girl was murdered because he mistakenly believed she was VietCong.  Rather, she was easy pickings.Fox - the ostensible 'goodie' - is a quiet, gentle, family man, conscripted into the Army, where he doesn't want to be - the antithesis of Penn. However, his gentle, trusting nature endangers his own life and possibly the lives of his comrades (he naively accepts food from the villagers and helps them farm their land, whilst they are harbouring VietCong).  Fox is the only person to make a stand against the brutal rape, but he is too cowardly to save her from being killed.  Indeed, he does not report the murder until his own life is threatened, a life which was originally saved by the man he reports.  Although racked with guilt, his character is ultimately on nobody's side but his own.The weight attached to these two characters is immense and both Penn and Fox made very good performances.  However, Penn's performance was vastly superior.  He was every bit as coarse and vulgar as his character should be, yet charged with vulnerable energy.   I found Fox rather average - a typical all-American 'goodie', whose moral outbursts were slightly unconvincing at times.Supporting cast were also very good, particularly Leguizamo, who played the backstabbing 'ally' to Fox.  Le was also good, but her role was limited to a lot of hysteria.  It is interesting to see that her character's name was never mentioned until her body was found.  Reilly and Harvey were also limited, and Harvey's attempts at being 'hard' were irritating beyond extreme.  However, they served well to support Penn.A very good film, which produces a variety of responses every time you watch it.",Null,1,2,16 September 2003
The Fly," Metaphor
","***** WARNING SPOILERS ****** As explained already, 'The Fly' (1986) is a re-make of the 1958 sci-horror of the same title. However, whilst the earlier film is a simple horror story of a man who (part) mutates into a fly, Cronenberg's version is a much more complex pic that appears to be a metaphor for mental illness more than anything else.Story focuses on Seth Brundle (Goldblum), a gentle, socially awkward yet genius scientist who is working on a cure for his motion sickness (the latter preventing him from getting out much), in the form of teleportation through telepods. Brundle meets Ronnie (Davis), a journalist, and, keen to find a companion in his work, invites her to his warehouse apartment. Ronnie is immediately intrigued by his work and his boyish charms, and ends up agreeing to record his work to print an article when it is complete. Almost immediately, they begin a love affair.Their affair is ultimately the making and breaking of Brundle and is the turning point of the film (rather than Brundle's teleportation through the pods). Having previously been a recluse, confined to his apartment, obsessively wearing the same clothes every day (and who considers cheeseburgers and a deluxe coffee-machine to be the sum excitement of his life!), Ronnie's sensual (and almost motherly) love awakens a passion (and conversely a jealousy) in Brundle he has never known before. Indeed, Cronenberg conveys this metaphorically. Brundle cannot teleport flesh (and there is a nasty scene with a baboon when he does) until his love affair with Ronnie - who essentially teaches him 'how to be made crazy by flesh'. This is literally what happens. Brundle realises his missing component, re-programmes his computer and the teleportation is successful.Whilst his love for Ronnie helps to complete his work, it ultimately destroys him. In a fit of jealousy when she goes away to confront her meddlesome and lecherous ex (Getz), Brundle recklessly teleports himself, not knowing the pod is contaminated with a fly. The insect is obviously another metaphor, otherwise Brundle would have fused with every mite on his body! The telepods are Brundle's only means of leaving his confined existence - a form of deconstruction/reconstruction that fuses him with an insect at genetic level which is at first exhilarating then terrifying. It is from here that (well I believe) the film becomes a metaphor for mental illness. Having lived with someone with bipolar disorder, Brundle's behaviour very much mirrors the symptoms and personality traits: initially, he is sexually insatiable, promiscuous, irritable, unable to sleep, aggressive, speaks too fast, has an almighty God complex and oodles of energy (very much like a high - even to the extent that he craves sweet foods). When Ronnie can't keep up with him, she becomes 'a drag', who only has a 'basic understanding of the flesh' - clearly meaning he has 'progressed' from mere sex to a higher level of consciousness (bipolar sufferers often feel they 'see' and appreciate life more than others). Inevitably, his actions end their relationship because she doesn't understand him.Before long, 'the insect' starts to change him physically as well. He develops skin rashes, his nails, teeth and hair start to drop out and he is unable to eat food (food 'hurts') - common fears with Anxiety (particularly food intolerances) when the 'high' starts to wane and the reckless behaviour catches up with the body. What is noticeable is that Cronenberg very much focuses on Brundle's psychological changes before the gruesome physical downfall. There is no scientific explanation of why he physically metamorphs the way he does because it is really not important. Ultimately, his physical and mental state spiral down into something incapacitating (depression) and ugly until he becomes emotionally devoid to the point of dangerous (when the insect is 'awake'). He feels his only option is to merge with Ronnie and their baby, but his attempts at 'the perfect family' fail. Ultimately, from being at his mental and physical peak, Brundle is left with nothing, marked by the fact that it is the lecherous, 'disgusting' ex who eventually who steps up to the mark of hero by helping Ronnie with her abortion and saves her at the end.The poignancy of the film is that Brundle is always alone, no matter what stage he is at, be it reclusive nerd, arrogant genius or horribly disabled. Whilst the brief relationship with Ronnie is both tender and sweet (he even asks if it is a relationship, he is that naive) it is only brief and ultimately the cause of his demise. One can only wish he had never met Ronnie and kept to his caged existence. It shows the frustration of someone who cannot handle 'the flesh' - i.e. a relationship - who is always relegated to a life alone constantly craving understanding.My criticism of the film is the amount of gratuitous gore which looks both dated and ludicrous (particularly when she pulls his jaw off) and which distracts from the main theme of the film, to the point that a lot of people don't get it. Also, I felt Ronnie's character was very one-dimensional - ultimately a catalyst for Brundle - although Davis brought a natural, intriguing intelligence to it and did the best she could. Also, the leads' off-screen romance helped a lot with the chemistry between the characters.A brilliant film that is probably the best so far of conveying the horrors and frustration of a world confined by illness.",9,0,1,31 May 2010
Pretty Woman," Banal
","Oh heaven forbid a PROSTITUTE find a bit of happiness!!!  Indeed, such filth should be tortured and burned at the stake and the poor innocent pervert who pays for it should be saved from such degradation!!Honestly you would think that some people on here - of the flaccid variety no doubt - left their brains (and their trousers) in the 15th century!  So she's a prossie - so what???? My only complaint is that Julia Roberts is too clean and pretty to play the part realistically.  This film is no more than a cheesy happy-ever-after flick, not an advert for prostitution.  Indeed, I hope it gave these poor women hope and made people realise that women are more than just a pair of walking knickers!  Roberts was funny and intelligent at all times.  Gere, however, was very wooden and could have done with some hair dye!",Null,0,1,16 September 2003
