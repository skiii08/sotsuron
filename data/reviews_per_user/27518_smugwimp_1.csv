Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny for some, mildly cute for others...
","I must start with the fact that my wife LOVED this movie. She started laughing from the start, and didn't finish until we were leaving the theatre. I almost had to carry her.That said, I am afraid my enjoyment was considerably less. It was a very SILLY movie. I could 'see' the humour, and understand what they were trying to do with it, I just didn't enjoy it as much.However if you like silly movies, then I'm sure you will like this one too. But if you're like me and prefer a different kind of humour (something along the lines of Mel Brooks), then you may be better off waiting for the DVD release, I suspect in a couple of months.Apparently there are videos up on youtube that you can watch as a hint to his style of humour. I only wish I had seen those ahead of time.",6,5,9,14 November 2006
