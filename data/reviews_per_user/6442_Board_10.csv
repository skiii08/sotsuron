The Blair Witch Project," Awful, terrible &...(drum roll) a waste of time!
","Let me just say that I found approximately 10 seconds of this film interesting! I can reveal for you that it's the last 10 seconds of the film! I love movies where they just build up to a great climax, but that isn't the case here. This is just one and a half hour of indifferent walking in the woods and then 10 scary seconds in the end. Maybe this movie just wasn't for me, as I'm not into many of those horror movies, as I find them simply non-scary. 'I still know what you did last summer' was better than this! That was a mediocre movie even, but this is simply a waste of time in my opinion! Watch the last 5-10 minutes or something and you won't waste the one and a half hour I did! Time I'll never get back!",1,12,22,6 November 2002
Saturday Night Fever," The movie itself is pretty empty, but worth owning for Travolta's moves alone!
","I think my headline sums it up pretty good (spoilers ahead): The story line is simply and we have seen it a million times before; Travolta is a guy who works in a store and all he basically lives for is going to the disco every Saturday night. Then they get drunk and one of his friends falls of a bridge. He then realizes he better start taking his life seriously. The end. Bu-hu-hu! The story is sappy and gross and if it hadn't been for Travolta's dance moves at the disco I would have sold my copy of the film as soon as possible. When it comes to the two minuttes in the middle of the film where Travolta is alone on the dancefloor, I can only praise this movie for some of the most evil dancing I've seen!!!",5,0,1,7 March 2003
Remember the Titans," Pretty corny movie!
","Okay, if you haven't seen this movie, you might not want to read on, as this contains spoilers (pretty big ones). Denzel plays a coach of a football team and it's a time when racism and prejudices are common (1971). Denzel decides to have the whites and the blacks train together and they don't like it. He takes them on a camp and you can probably figure out what happens there...? If you can't figure it out I will be glad to reveal that they start liking each other and becomes good friends! When they get home people can't understand how they can like each other and stuff like that, but the team manages to convince some of them that racism is wrong and a super corny scene is when one of the leading roles' girlfriend says something like 'I will try and like them for you' or some s*** like that! The team gets to the final and they of course win! This was a really corny and gross movie and I can't say that I enjoyed it. It had okay acting and such but all this heroic stuff and corny Americanism made the movie weak! I gave it 3/10 and don't feel that it deserves anymore than that!",3,5,9,10 November 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," Way, way, way too long and boring!!!
","As this was at no. 24 in Imdb's top 250 I didn't exactly expect it to be superb, but at least watchable. Well, I thought it dragged on for way to long. It lasted three and a half hours and it maybe could have captured me if it had only been one and a half hours. I think the first while it was alright, had a good mood and so on and didn't feel too long (which maybe also had something to do with that I had a couple of small breaks to get juice and so on), but when it got past the two hours/two and a half hours it dragged out. Nothing exciting happened, it got dull and just wanted it to end. I've seen other movies that has been this way, but a good ending came in and dragged the movie up. I didn't really see such and ending in this movie. It just went downhill and didn't really have a climax in my opinion. So all in all a disappointment in my opinion as it was way too long and boring, so I can't really give more than 3 out of 10, I'm afraid...",3,10,37,30 April 2003
Schindler's List," A true masterpiece
","A fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. I rarely use the word superb, but superb isn't even enough for this movie! A true masterpiece, as I said in my summary. One of only two movies that I would give that grade (the other being 'Breaking the waves'). This comes in as the second best film I've seen my entire life! This movie isn't a brutal film like Spielberg's other WWII movie 'Saving Private Ryan' (which also is superb in my opinion), but deals with concentration camps instead of the battlefields. One of only a few emotional and moving movies I've seen - and one of the best!!",10,10,16,5 October 2002
Gran Torino," Looked promising but alas!
","Like most others, I like Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director (at least from around the year 2000 onwards). 'Million dollar baby' and 'Changeling' were two quite lovely films to give just two examples of him as a director. 'Gran Torino' definitely had its strong points, and I enjoyed the themes of misplaced racism, and how it sucks the joy out of life, the unsolvable problem with gangs, and the need to get your problems off your chest instead of keeping them inside. I also liked the pale colours of this film (just like in Changeling), which was perfect for this bleak environment. But the problem for me with this film was simply that it wasn't very credible.The main character Walt (Eastwood himself) used a lot of foul language, but as he did so in almost every sentence and so overtly, it simply ended up becoming a caricature. At one point his son and daughter in law came to Walt's birthday and suggested that he moved into a nursing home. The camera then filmed a close-up of Eastwood, whose mouth opened and turned downwards more and more in a fit of rage. It just seemed like something from a comic book. Eastwood is one of the archetypical tough guys, but here he simply seemed like a parody of himself. Later, Eastwood dropped a glass of alcohol as he was shocked. It just fell to the ground all too late for it to seem like a believable reaction and not one done by an actor in a poor film (it will make sense if you watch the scene). This is of course a minor detail, but it honestly seemed to suggest that there hadn't been paid enough attention to the editing and the artistic effects used in creating a story that would seem real rather than just a story. This surprised me a bit, as I didn't notice anything like this in the two other Eastwood film mentioned above.One of the other actors, Bee Vang playing Thao, was even worse. He simply didn't give a very good performance. Especially when he was locked into the basement, his hammering on the door simply didn't seem real.Lastly, I didn't find it believable that Walt warmed to the Hmong people because of the reasons shown in the film. It seemed credible that he would help the neighbouring girl when she was in trouble with a gang on the street, but he still a bit too easily went from banning all Hmong people from his property to accepting the neighbouring girl's dinner invitation with her entire family simply because they had beer and because the girl was 'alright' as he said. Nevertheless, this was something that I could easily have overlooked if the rest of the film had been better – they are after all trying to tell a story, and there has to be some progress.With better dialogue, better acting and a slightly better script, this film could have made me feel something real rather than make me cringe – which is what it too often did.Judging from the average rating here on IMDb most people love this film, but I've also seen several people here on IMDb say exactly the same things as I have done in this review (acting, dialogue, etc.), so it seems to be a film that splits the viewers in two camps. I find that if I don't like an otherwise celebrated film it's simply because I didn't become engaged in the story or the characters. But usually I just find films like that mediocre and I can see why other people might like them, and usually I can see that they are well-made and well-acted. Two examples could be Crash or Magnolia. They simply didn't do anything for me. They were well-made, well-acted, and I understand why people like them. But calling them poor films or even poorly made? Certainly not! It's rare that I find an otherwise celebrated film poor, but Gran Torino seems to be a film that people either find excellent or poor. I'm standing on the edge of saying poor (which is 3/10 for me), but due to it's good points I will give it 4/10.",4,2,4,19 August 2013
Black Hawk Down," Boring movie!
","I think 'Black hawk down' was pretty boring and I gave it 3 out of 10!! The battle scenes in this movie were boring and uninteresting. The symbol of they weren't killing innocent people was lame and the whole movie was just too American! Dull ending, stupid humor that didn't fit into this type of movie and it was way too long, especially since it didn't create any excitement! If I want to see an exciting war movie I prefer the superb 'Saving private Ryan' at anytime!! I guess a friend of mine was right when he said that Americans can't make war movies after September 11th!",3,2,6,9 November 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Like so many other films....Nothing special
","I think this movie had the potential of being good, but didn't succeed at it - at least not for me. When Tom Cruise visited the house with all the people it started getting good, but then it went downhill again (instead of uphill). We was never told what was so dangerous about that house party, we never was told who the people were and we was never told what was the deal with Nicole Kidman and her involvement in all this. Of course there may be something for us to figure out for ourselves in movies, but this had to many loose ends in my opinion, to make it to hard to figure it out and just made it a movie where you just said 'Nah, I couldn't really say if it was good or bad, as it had too many loose ends'. It's not like it was completely crazy and weird like 'Lost highway' for instance, but it just a bit boring and instead of building up to big climax it kind of faded out a whole hour! It also lasted almost 3 hours, so it was too long to use on a film like this in my opinion. I don't mind long films if they're good, but this was as I said just a film where I said 'Nothing special', which for me basically is a waste of time.",4,1,3,14 November 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," If I hadn't seen millions of remakes, plagerisms & pastiches of this, it might have been even better!
","* Contains spoilers * This is the movie that has that 'I wish I never been born' thing, where an angel shows him how his life would have been if he hadn't been born, and before seeing this movie today, I had seen it re-done a thousand times in various (mostly lame/gross) stuff, even in 'Married with children' (which was a bit funny, and quite the opposite of this movie). So when I found out that this was were it came from (unless I'm mistaken), I must admit that I felt a little grossified. But after all, I liked the movie, and the small grossification was blown out of the water by the ending. Although it was happy, preachy and so on, it impressed me and sent chills down my spine and gave me a bit of a lump in my throat. Overall, this pushed the movie up to be among the best of the old movies I've seen and I'll be a little generous and give it an 8 out of 10.",8,2,5,4 January 2004
Slumdog Millionaire," Did it make me fell good? Yes. Did it make me think? Not really
","As everybody says this is a feel good film. When the film was over I did feel good, although the feel good factor was not as great as in other films I've seen, and I did also find that the film was somewhat predictable. I think a film should first and foremost be entertainment, but when that aim has been achieved, a film should also raise issues and make you think about certain things. Although I found this film to be stylistically well-made, I didn't feel that it raised many issues or made me think once it was over. The few issues it did raise (like 'you don't have to be worthless just because you're poor') didn't seem particular original. If you're just looking for entertainment, then I think it would be worth seeing this film. If you want more than entertainment, then there are many other films I would rather recommend.",6,3,6,1 April 2009
