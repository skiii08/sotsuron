Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Greatest Film ever made
","I've given out 5 ratings of 10 - and this movie tops them all. From the 1st time I laid my eyes on this masterpiece of cinema at around age 7, I decided that this would be my benchmark for all films to follow. 25 years later and none have ever surpassed. Many say Temple of Doom was the best of the Indy films although the original does it for me with it's constantly changing locations, complex characters and the impressively high level of entertainment in every scene. I feel that this is the shining light for young directors wanting to see how to make an action movie. Nothing needs to changed. At all.NOTE: I'm a little biased on this one as I had the movie sticker book - and filled the whole thing up. (Mum forgets where she put it. I suspect worms are looking it right now)",10,0,0,25 January 2017
