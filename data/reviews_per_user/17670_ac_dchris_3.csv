The Blair Witch Project," If you didn't think it was scary you have NO IMAGINATION!
","If you didn't think this movie was scary then you have no imagination. I don't mean that if you didn't wet yourself you are a rock. When I first saw it I was like is that all? I walked out of the theatre ready to bash the movie. Then I started to think about it more and more. The reason this movie is so good is not what it shows you but what it doesn't show you. If you try to fill in the blanks after you see it, you can make the movie scarier. Ask yourself what is going on that you can't see. Also, it's unfair to criticize the actors in any way because it was real. There wasn't a script so all you see is talent. You have to put yourself in the place of the actors to get anything out of this movie and that takes imagination that a lot of people don't have.",Null,0,1,8 August 2000
Pitch Black," GOOD FLICK if you're in the mood
","Pitch Black is a sweet sci fi thriller. Don't be swayed by those that call it a knock off or a 'B' movie. This is more than a one-dimentional movie, it has a lot of good plot twists. Vin Diesel as Riddick was a great move. Riddick is one of the better movie killers ever. And if anyone claims to have predicted the ending then they're full of something stinky.",Null,0,0,3 November 2000
Event Horizon," Scary movie, should be watched
","I remember the trailer for this movie said that it is the scariest movie you will ever see. ok, maybe it wasn't but I saw this movie in my hometown just after the theatre installed the digital sound for the re-release of the Star Wars trilogy and I thought it was scary. Gore and violence made it better. If you want a thrill watch it, but make sure you crank it up.",Null,0,0,8 August 2000
