The Blair Witch Project," I will NEVER camp again!!!
","Oh my goodness!  I am completely amazed at this movies ability to scare the holy beejesus out of you without gore and without hitting you over the head with the plot!  I think that because of the 'documentary' style you really feel like you know the characters, you see them in very candid and intimate moments and the emotions are very real.  How many times has a horror movie actually taken time to get the know the characters before they start hacking away at them.  The terror here is in the possibilities and the imagination of the viewer.  Some of us may be amazed to find out that our own imaginations are scarier than hollywood could ever hope to be!  Bravo, Haxan...BRAVO!The Blair Witch could kick Jason's butt anyday!!!!",10,2,3,19 July 1999
