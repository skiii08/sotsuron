Airlift," Excellent movie ever :D
","Fastrack, no love story, very straight forward and mature movie especially for Indians.Only one religion and that is HUMANITY. One man army, took all the responsibilities and makes fastest decisions :)Awesome role of Akshay Kumar with less dialogues, just follow the Karma unconditionally.Movie must go for Oscar nomination. Social awareness to make unity to solve any impossible problems.Government must release it tax free.Once again Akshay proved his best. Excellent start of 2016. Hats off, Cheers :D",10,0,1,26 January 2016
