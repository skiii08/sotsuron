Skyfall," Awesome movie
","After Casino Royal and Quantum of Solace I had very low expectations for this movie. Yeah, those two were average (or just above) action movies, but not really Bond-movies. MI6 was totally out of the picture, Bond was only killing but had nothing left of his charm. It had just nothing to do with 007. So with expectations at a very low point I went to see Skyfall in the local cinema. And boy, how wrong were my expectations! All what was wrong in the last two movies has been undone. MI6 is back in the picture, Bond operates in the name of Britain instead for personal vendettas and there are moments in the movie were the charms of Bond are back. I loved it.",9,0,11,6 November 2012
