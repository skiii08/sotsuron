Come and See," Very powerful
","This is just about as powerful as a war film can get.The year is 1943. A teenage Belorussian boy by the name of Florya finds a rifle and then joins the resistance to fight the Germans. On the way he sees all the horrors of war and thats what this film is really about.This is one of the most powerful war films I've seen and I have seen a lot. The events aren't dramatized too much and the film manages to keep a good sense of realism. At the same time however it achieves an excellent surrealistic atmosphere by contrasting this young boy to the horrors of war that surround him. The soundtrack helps a lot in this area by not really providing music in the traditional sense but rather these very tense and powerful, slightly ambient noises. Reminded me a lot of the sound that an orchestra makes when they're getting ready right before the start of a concert. Now the film was made during Soviet times so it does show the Germans in a bad light and as very cruel but to a large extent, thats how things were. Aleksei Kravchenko, the actor portraying Florya, pulls the job off well despite his young age. He doesn't have much dialog to say and this really is more of a visual film.To add to the artistic qualities of this film, there is also an excellent technical side. In addition to the soundtrack which I mentioned before, this film has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a long time. Director Elem Klimov makes excellent use of the steadycam with which he follows his characters as they go from one place to another and without cutting away. There are two excellent examples of this: First is when Florya comes back to his village and the camera follows him as he comes down a hill, goes into his yard and then into his house. The second is the last shot in the film which follows a collumn of soldiers, then takes a brief detour (which is more of a shortcut actually) into a forest and then rejoins that group of soldiers some time later. Simply awesome. The battle scenes are very intense, especially one of a group of German soldiers taking out a village. What I really liked was that everything seemed genuine. During one scene where a bomber bombed a forest, you could really see the dirt being kicked up and trees falling down.An absolute must see film.",10,19,23,27 January 2007
Mission: Impossible III," A fun summer experience
","Ethan Hunt is back and in full force. We start of with him having retreated from active field duty and has committed himself to training new agents. But after a former pupil of his gets kidnapped by international arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman), he gets back in the game to bring him down and on his way goes to such places as the Vatican and Shanghai.The first Mission:Impossible was a classic, the second an adrenaline driven disappointment with the Cruise being the only superhero. This film however manages to capture the best aspects of both of those films and combine them into enjoyable flick.The story is there but it doesn't take center stage in this one, a thing that somewhat disappointed me since they could have really done better in that department, but instead it focuses on the characters, a thing that writer/director J.J Abrams (Lost, Alias) is best at. In addition to showing a more human side to super agent Ethan Hunt and giving us an overview of his personal life, there is a great supporting cast and above all, Hunt works as a part of a team and not just solo. In addition to Ving Rhames coming back for a third time around, the film also boasts Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as members of Hunt's IMF team. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the bad guy and what a bad guy this is. He doesn't care if he's about to die but remains calm all the time and manages to make threats even when facing death itself while at the same time, not being too over the top. Laurence Fishburne plays the bureaucrat boss of Hunt and he too fits his role well. But the real treat is a small, almost cameo like role from Simon Pegg. He plays a lab technician at IMF headquarters and even though his screen time is limited, he manages to crank out some of the wittiest sentences ever put onto celluloid. Overall, this film has more emphasis on comedy than the previous two but it never goes too far or gets annoying. Though one thing that did bother me a bit was how they deviated a bit too far from realism with all the spy stuff, thereby making everything seem so easy and not too challenging for the participants.This is JJ Abrams's debut film (and the most expensive directorial debut in history) and he handles the big job well, if this were another episode of one of his TV shows. As one would expect from a film like this, there are several big action set pieces such as a helicopter chase in a wind park, an aerial attack on a convoy of vehicles and a high speed pursuit through the streets of Shanghai, in addition to various shootouts and other cool stunts. Well, the action was awesome but as I mentioned before, if this was a TV show. I remember watching this documentary on the making of the pilot for Lost and there is this one running scene that was done by doing a closeup of the actors faces and then having them jump up and down in one spot but then when shown on the big screen, it looks like running. That is exactly what this film felt like. The action is very quick cut, everything is shot with shaky zoomed in closeups and the technique of shooting the action at low frame rates whereby things seem faster and more chaotic than they actually are, all kept reminding me of yet another episode of some TV show. They could at least let us enjoy the beauty of the action (and it isn't like they had budget constraints, the very thing that makes TV action scenes seem the way they are). Overall, Daniel Mindel's camera-work was competent and there were some cool shots here and there but overall, nothing that special. The soundtrack, done by Michael Giacchio, fits the film perfectly and at times reminds of his score for Lost.Overall, a very entertaining film, even with its slight drawbacks.",8,0,1,5 May 2006
Skyfall," The ship is heading towards the right course but its still far from home port
","I have been a huge Bond fan for as long as I can remember, I have seen all the films multiple times. With the latest one, Skyfall, Bond is starting to make his way back to his roots but only just slightly. The plot revolves around a stolen list of MI6 agents that the agency is trying to retrieve while at the same time M's dubious past is catching up with her in dangerous ways. Bond goes from London to Turkey to Shanghai to Scotland with a fair bit of chases and action on the way. M takes a very prominent role in this one and James Bond's character, including his flaws and background, are explored much more deeply than ever before. But is this what we really want from a James Bond film?The key issue for me as a long time Bond fan is his style, the formula of Bond. Up until Die Another Day (included) the Bond films had a very uniform style of lighthearted escapism with all the little tweaks that make Bond Bond included. However once Daniel Craig took off with Casino Royale (and what continues into Skyfall) is a Jason Bourne/Mission Impossible style relatively generic action-thriller with some Bond elements thrown in. Bond had a formula that worked very well, there was nothing wrong with it. It is supposed to be a little lighthearted, a little shallow, chauvinistic, stylish escapist entertainment. You went to see a Bond film because it was fun, it was so detached from everyday life and every guy wanted to be like Bond. Now however they have gone down the route of making a very 'dark' Bond film, here a lot of attention is on the characters and their problems and and the plot line which has usually been of Bond trying to save the world in some way is utterly secondary in Skyfall. However I as a true Bond fan want to see him in a plot driven save-the-world type of mission, I am not interested in a dark character drama that is close to being indistinguishable from any generic thriller. That is the biggest flaw of this film: it is ignoring a formula that works so well and instead tries to be something new....but that new is just copying Jason Bourne and other similar films. Skyfall, as it is released 50 years after the first Bond film, is rich in references to the older films which are a delight for a Bond fan to watch out for but they really are more a depressing reminder of 'the good old days' and stand as a stark contrast to the cold empty shell that Bond has become today. Particularly the female element, such a key aspect of all previous Bond films, is very toned down and it seems that M is more the Bond girl in this film than any other girl. However to finish on a high note, the film had a very nice ending from the standpoint of a Bond fan, a hint of things to come which seem to be going back closer to what Bond used to be and should always be. The film itself isn't bad, its a very interesting thriller. Its only that it isn't very strong as a Bond film but from the way things were heading in Skyfall, it seems that the next Bond film should be a bit closer to what Bond should be.",7,55,119,27 October 2012
Alexander," Alexander
","Alexander: Directed by Oliver Stone, starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins*Possible spoilers*Yet another big budget epic, this time on the life of Alexander the Great. The film starts off with a young Alexander who is nurtured and cared for by his mother who is played by Angelina Jolie (and has this really annoying accent that reminds me of some old Bond villains). Every now and then this is cut into by a narration by Anthony Hopkin's character who is a king, about some 40 years after Alexander's death, and is citing the story to have it written down. Anyway, she cares for Alexander a lot but isn't getting along with his father King Philip (Val Kilmer). There are glimpses here and there of Alexander growing up with him talking to his father about Achillies, being tutored by Aristotle and him meeting his horse. But as he gets older, his mother tells him that he must marry quickly and get a child because Philip has gotten a new wife who is already pregnant and if Alexander does not do it, his and his mothers family will be in danger of losing everything that they have got. Then one night during a big party, Alexander gets into an argument with his dad who banishes him from his kingdom. Then, through some confusing way that I didn't really get and this is again supposedly explained by Ptolemy (Hopkins) but you have to pay attention really hard if you want to know what happened. This is the films first big mistake in which Alexander's rise from being a nobody prince and being banished from his father's kingdom rises within the period of about 10 seconds to some great general who is commanding a 40,000 man army against the king of Persia. A great opportunity to show the real rise of Alexander was simply thrown away. Anyway, he keeps on going east but despite his victories, conflicts arise with his followers who want to go back to their homes and don't like how Alexander is being nice to the peoples he conquered. And that basically takes up the rest of the movie. This movie is confused by itself. This is because the movie never really understands, what part of Alexander's life does it want to tell. It isn't really a war movie since there are only two two battles and even those are quite shabby. It isn't really a love movie because even though there is romance and phenomenally pathetic gay relationships, that still isn't what the movie is quite about. The closest it gets to being about one thing are the conflicts between Alexander and his generals. There is even some unintentional humor in this turkey with Alexander supposedly being the one who discovered and named monkeys as monkeys while on conquest of India and being the first one to suggest the building of a canal through Egypt. I seriously laughed when these things were mentioned. The movie never achieves a really epic feel that was masterfully created in LOTR. I was hoping for a movie about great conquests and battles but this was much smaller and more about one man. The sets and the costumes were colorful and plentiful so it was a slight feast for the eyes. The CGI was OK and fortunately there wasn't too much of it. The cinematography was somewhat inconsistent. For the most part it was good with excellent aerials and shots of beautiful scenery but then really went down the drain in some parts of the battle scenes. As for the battle scenes themselves, they simply sucked. There were a couple of good scenes but for the most part the camera was shaking like it was an earthquake and the editing so mixed up that you seriously couldn't make out anything but swords clashing and blood flying. They simply weren't captivating enough and there were too many scenes where the soldiers were just standing there even though it was supposedly a very intense battle. The soundtrack (made by Vangelis) was pretty good but the way Stone used it simple made the movie so melodramatic that it really made me grab my head at how can they have created something like this. Some movies can do this with style but Alexander sure is not one of them. I am not going to say that you should stay away but I recommend that you'd be better off watching something else instead",6,2,4,22 January 2005
Disturbia," Modern day Hitchcock
","Vertigo meets the 21st century. In what is essentially a remake of Hitchcock's classic, a high school teenager (Shia LeBeouf) is sentenced to house arrest and has a tracking device placed on him, thereby making him unable to leave his home. After a while he starts spying on his neighbors, most notably a pretty young girl who moved in next door. But all is not well in suburbia as one of the neighbors is up to some pretty strange things. With the help of a classmate and his new found love interest, LeBeouf sets off to discover what is really going on. As I have mentioned before, this is Vertigo in the 21st century- a man unable to leave his house thinks one of his neighbors is a murderer and then with the help of his friends, starts playing detective. Although casting someone like LeBeouf in the lead and including the whole teenage angle might make this seem like another run on the mill teen slasher, this is not it. The youth element is treated very effectively in the sense that it is there but it is not overplayed and is in fact kept to a relative minimum. There is some humor but the main focus is instead on the story and this is where the film's strength lies.LeBeouf, despite his youth, is an excellent actor and I look forward to seeing him in more films. He manages to find that excellent balance between providing some comedic relief while at the same time still staying serious. DJ Caruso does a pretty good job of directing this film. There is of course quite a bit of modern style camera shaking and fast cutting (when compared to Hitchcock's version) but fortunately this too is kept in check and isn't overdone like it is in so many other films. A nice film to keep you thrilled for an evening.",8,1,3,26 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond is back but the 007 is weak in this one
","James Bond returns wearing camouflage, and perhaps a little too much of it.The story continues from where Casino Royale left off. Bond is out to get revenge on those who brought about the death of love. At the same time he uncovers a secret organization and its sinister plans and all of these things are tied together.Unlike previous films, this one heavily emphasizes Bond as a person, his feelings and emotions. No longer is he a word traveling, womanizing superhero but someone more down to earth, someone who feels. Although this is good from certain point of view, giving the character a bit more depth and making him somewhat more realistic, it isn't quite the classic Bond we have grown to love and admire over the years. Bond has also seemingly misplaced his sense of humor. Where did it go? Unlike most of the previous films, Bond's mission in this one isn't as clear as it used to be. There is no concrete checklist of things he has to accomplish. Instead things are much more vague and ambiguous. The opening scene, although nicely reminiscent of The Living Daylights at times, seems to come completely out of the blue giving little explanation as to why those things are going on. The classic 'bad guy's scheme' is very classic-Bond and an extremely interesting one, combining modern issues with the best of what makes Bond what he is. Yet this detail seems to be underplayed and very little attention is given to it. It is treated as if it were little more than some minor side element.On the technical side, the influence of films like the Bourne series is strong. Which isn't surprising because the two series now share the same second unit director (the guy who shoots the action scenes). The camera has been brought much closer to the action, a lot more use is made of hand-held or just generally shaky cameras and the editing is something out of a Jerry Bruckheimer production. Luckily on this film this style isn't as over the top annoying as it is in the Bourne ones but yet again, this is not representative of the Bond films I grew to love over the years. Same goes for the music- it is an excellent soundtrack, some really nice tunes in there, but it just isn't Bond. In fact the classic full orchestra Bond theme can't even be heard once during the entire film. All of these things by themselves aren't bad at all but the series has just gotten a little too far from its roots.A good film definitely but it just doesn't feel quite what a Bond film should feel like.",8,2,5,7 November 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," The saga comes to an end
","X-Men: The Last Stand The film starts off at around where the second one left off, right after the supposed death of Jean Grey. But we soon discover that she has returned in all her glory (and an uncontrollable one at that). Among other things, a pharmaceutical company has developed a way to suppress the mutant X-gene and Magneto won't allow it. He starts gathering an army to make a stand against the humans.All of the X-Men that we've grown to love over the course of the past two films are back in this one, in addition to a whole bunch of new ones. Wolverine is still himself but I feel that they overdid it with his cockiness. Storm is beautiful but there isn't anything that special about her. And there are of course the grand old men, Magneto and Xavier who despite trying, aren't quite as good as they were in the previous installments. As for the newcomers, the one I liked the most was Beast played by Kelsey Grammar.The storyline has got some good ideas in it but those aren't put to the best use. With the film's 104 minute running time, a whole half hour shorter than X2, everything feels rushed. They could have told a much better story if they had taken some time to go deeper into things but instead they got this huge film but then showed us only a little bit of everything but not enough of anything that would satisfy the audience.Some may blame this (and other) shortcomings on director Brett Ratner who took over after Bryan Singer left to do Superman Returns. But I say blame screenwriter Simon Kinberg who has also given us such turkeys as XXX2 and Charlie's Angles 2. As is trademark for him, the dialog is awful and way too cheesy and the storyline has quite a few plot holes and leaps of logic. With the material given, Ratner did a fine job. Not the best possible but still pretty good. The action was there but at times felt somewhat rushed and it simply didn't have the impact that it did in the first two. The special effects were good but nothing special. At times they almost felt a little dull. The cinematography, which according to IMDb was done by both Phillipe Rousselot and Dante Spinotti is OK but doesn't quite reach the levels that Tom Siegel achieved on the first two films. John Powell's soundtrack goes from some nice combos of choir and orchestra to some very boring and generic orchestral.Overall, a pretty good film if it didn't have the excellent X1 and X2 to live up to but since that is taken into consideration, a bit disappointing. Not the best way to end an otherwise great series like this.7/10",7,2,5,26 May 2006
Children of Men," A film that blew me away
","It has been a long that a film like this has so pleasantly surprised me. Anyway, the plot is quite straightforward: It is the year 2027 and the world is in deep trouble. For around 18 years or so, no woman has given birth to a baby and nobody knows what is the cause of this infertility. The story takes place in a semi-totalitarian Britain where Clive Owen plays a reluctant hero who by his ex-wife (Julianne Moore), the leader of a resistance group known as The Fishes, is caught up in the events surrounding the rescue of a young immigrant woman who happens to be pregnant. I mentioned immigrant woman for in the British society in this film, all illegal immigrants are being hunted down and put into camps. Michael Cain also has a somewhat small role as a hippie who is a friend of Owen's character. I have nothing more to say than wow when talking about this film. The concept is great and it is well executed. Cain, Owen, Moore and the few other main characters all put on top notch performances. They are believable and Cain I fond to be a big delight. Although the film takes place about 20 years in the future, everything doesn't seem all that futuristic. That however doesn't bother at all since the production designer went for a more rugged and broken down look which works excellently and adds to the mood of the film. The direction, done by Alfonso Cuaron, is what I found to be the strongest aspect of this film. Together with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki they go for a very shock and awe approach. Everything feels fresh and shocking, a trait that is amplified even further when viewing this in a movie theater. You never know when somebody might get shot and when that person does, it happens then and there, blowing you away. The cinematography is beautiful. It is mostly long hand-held shots but fortunately those are quite stable hand-held shots. Never is there a sense of confusion that sometimes happens with other films where you can't tell what is going on. I especially adored the scenes of a battle between the resistance group and the army in the middle of which Owen is trying to escort the pregnant woman to safety. That was quite possibly one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen. The soundtrack relies a lot on characters in the film listening to music and not so much on music accompanying the action. All I have to say is that I recommend this at all costs. 10/10",10,10,18,11 November 2006
The Da Vinci Code," The DaVinci decoded
","Probably one of the most anticipated book to film adaptations of recent times, this film does live up to expectations.The plot, in case you aren't familiar with the book, revolves around a Harvard symbology professor by the name of Robert Langdon and a young French cryptologist named Sophie Neveu who go on a kind of a treasure hunt to find the greatest secret in history that could rattle the foundations of modern society. If you have read the novel, I have to say that the film follows it quite faithfully and never really deviates far from the words of Dan Brown.Tom Hanks may seem like an odd casting choice but he does an excellent job with his role. Convincing and intelligent, he even looks the part well. Audrey Tatou looks simply adorable with that awesome hairstyle of hers. The chemistry between them works well and doesn't go into any unnecessary or cheesy romance. There are also some good supporting roles by Ian McKellen (playing a historian who helps the leads on their quest) and Paul Bettany, the main antagonist. Alfred Molina also shows in the role of a villainous bishop but I felt that they could have given him a little more of a back story and explained his intent.Ron Howard does a decent job being the director. Along with cinematographer Salvatore Totino they have created some nice dark visuals and used and portrayed the locations (the Louvre in Paris among many other spectacular place) well but never having those overtake the story. There were also some wonderful flashbacks into various points in history while the back story was being explained. At 149 minutes, this film may seem long but that time goes by fast, but fortunately not too fast. My only complaint to Howard is that the film's biggest action scene is like is the case with many films these days, hampered by overly fast editing and unclear camera-work. Hans Zimmer has created a nice score that adds to the atmosphere of the film but never really rises above that.However what made me very mad was the ending. They could have done something incredible with it (for the sake of your enjoyment of this film, I'm not going to reveal it here) but instead, went a very politically correct route.Although it doesn't rise to any grand or new heights, this is still a very enjoyable film.8/10",8,1,4,20 May 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Silence of the Lambs- a decent thriller but not a horror
","Having seen Hannibal before this and enjoying it, I really got my hopes up since this was supposed to be even better (after all, it won 5 Oscars). And in many ways it is. Agent Clarice Starling has just joined the FBI and her first assignment is to track down a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. To do that, she enlists the help of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an infamous cannibal who is being held at a maximum security psychiatric hospital. From there on it is an excellent duel between Lecter and Starling, both delivering top notch performances (though unfortunately, we don't see too much of Lecter). As the FBI is closing in on Buffalo Bill, Lecter is growing over Starling. Though at first she was instructed to only 'get the goods and nothing else', she crosses that line. And from there it continues into the hunt for Buffalo Bill and the relationship between the two main characters. This movie was above all a thriller. It was tense, interesting and included everything that one could hope for. However, despite being listed so, it is not a horror. There are a few remote and moderately creepy elements but nothing to truly send chills down your back. The direction by Jonathan Demme I would describe as competent. It is strong but in a few places I felt that he could have made it a bit creepier and maybe even bloodier. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography which in this movie is represented by a heavy use of steadicam and well used hand-held shots is excellent and right on the mark. Overall an excellent thriller. 8/10",8,0,1,24 January 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," Mixed feelings
","The fourth part of the Die Hard franchise brings up mixed feelings in a longtime fan. In short it can be summed up in the words that this is a pretty good action film but not a very good Die Hard film.The plot revolves around a group of terrorists (or whatever you want to call them) taking down the computer infrastructure of the United States. A well chosen plot line, considering how much is run by computers these days. The attack starts off small but grows exponentially in its destructive power as the story flows along. Its a good premise but I don't think it was executed to the maximum of its potential. The sense of danger and Armageddon that such a thing would cause isn't reflected too much in the film. This would have added a lot to the film and from Die Hard 3, one can see that a strong plot and storyline carry a film very well.All the classic Die Hard characters are there but it isn't McClane who stands out the most. Justin Long plays a hacker who by coincidence happens to be with McClane when the attack happens and he stands out. His witty lines even rival those of the main character himself and overall it is a joy to see him on screen. McClane however is only a shadow of his former self which we saw in the first three films. The PG-13 rating (instead of an R like the first three) has really watered down McClane's vocabulary and if you're a fan of the franchise, you'll know exactly what I mean. He does have some occasional witty dialog but nothing like what it was in the first three. It seems like its just thrown in there to make this film more of a Die Hard film but unfortunately it doesn't work well. Bruce Willis doesn't feel like McClane at all anymore. The villain, played by Timothy Olyphant is exceptionally weak. The Gruber brothers are on a whole different level and even the somewhat lackluster main bad guy of part 2 towers over this guy. He doesn't come off as menacing or threatening at all. He is given some witty dialog but it just falls flat. The police chief, the guy who helps McClane all the time, is rather forgettable, something I can't say for the guys who played the corresponding character in the first three films.The film is directed by Len Wiseman of Underworld fame. He also has a background in TV commercial and music video production and it really shows here. Heavy color correction with the addition of heavy blue hues and the dimming out of colors gives the film a somewhat alienating look while as the first three kept things simple and thereby made you feel as if you were there. The camera-work, accompanied by the editing, is the usual quick cut, constantly move the camera type that has become so common these days. Not that it looks bad- its quite sleek looking actually, but its simply not Die Hard. Due to this and the slightly overly fast pacing, the film never manages to make good use of the surrounding settings, a very key part to the first three films. The pacing is like in too many modern films- things for some reason need to happen fast and be rushed.The action is OK I suppose. Although the previous films also had some pretty over the top stuff, this film takes it even further, all the way to the point where it just isn't that fun anymore since too much suspension of disbelief is required. But aside from that, I found the action quite enjoyable. The special effects were of course top notch and I was glad to see that many things were done for real and not just via CGI. And the score, by Marco Beltrami, was also excellent with some great tunes very fitting for an old school action film.Overall, not a bad action film but it pales in comparison to the first three.",6,7,14,27 June 2007
Spectre," Spectre: as a Bond film it's almost there
","Spectre, the latest of Daniel Craig's outings as Bond is certainly the most classic Bond feeling film of Craig's films. Gadgets, chases with expensive cars, a key henchman and globe trekking: it's got them all. The plot revolves around Bond discovering about an organization called Spectre (a nod to the Connery era films and the origin of Bond overall). At the same time however changes are happening at MI6 with a shift towards NSA/GCHQ style data gathering as opposed to assassins in the field, leaving Bond to be acting on his own accord. Also unlike most of the previous films, Spectre digs into Bond's past, telling us about his parents and upbringing which is quite a departure from the very impersonal and admittedly two dimensional characters of the pre-Craig era. As a lifelong Bond fan, I have to admit that I still prefer the films of Connery, Moore, Brosnan, Dalton and yes even Lazenby to those of Craig. However Spectre is definitely getting closer to those films, even if it isn't quite there yet. Sam Smith's theme song is a largely unmemorable one unfortunately, though it isn't bad either. The only thing about it is that his singing in Falsetto for a Bond theme just feels out of place a bit. The music in the film overall is still feeling a bit generic action thriller-esque with not as much use of the classic chords as I'd like. Not saying that the heavy brass of John Barry's orchestra should constantly be blaring but it could certainly be used more, really adds a lot to the feel of the film. Overall a pretty decent film. Definitely the most 'Bond' feeling of the Daniel Craig ones.",8,14,36,1 November 2015
