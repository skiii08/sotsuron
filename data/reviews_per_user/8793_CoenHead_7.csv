The Legend of Bagger Vance," Just as bad as 'The Natural', and worse...
","What do you have when you take an absurd script, marry it with boring subject matter(sports, but not just sports, GOLF!!!!!!!!), and stiff, mannered acting and directing?You get The Legend of Bagger Vance, a futile attempt to make golf, 1930's style, somehow seem interesting, mystical and worthwhile. Yawn...no....double yawn.  This thing could put the world's biggest insomniac to sleep.  Were it not for the pulchritude of Charlize Theron, this film would offer no redeeming values of any kind.I found myself wishing to punch Matt Damon's lights out on repeated occasions - he is perhaps the worst famous actor working today - it is definitely a horse race between he and Keanu Reeves.  Damon is probably going to be Redford's replacement as Hollywood's most overrated actor.  He is stiff, not believable, and offers the worst southern accent I've heard since Melanie Griffith. Why all the worship of this film?  I have no idea - Redford just reworked the awful 'Natural' script and placed the protagonist on a golf course instead - if any sport translates to film worse than baseball, it is golf!",Null,3,6,2 April 2002
Minority Report," If you've a brain, ignore this one (SPOILERS AHEAD)
","I'm astonished no one has mentioned the numerous flaws in logic in this film.  I haven't read the Philip Dick novel, so cannot say whether he is to be blamed for them; however, that isn't really necessary.  I'll take a second again to warn the dear reader that SPOILERS ARE AHEAD.First of all, the foundation of the movie lies on the issue of the Pre-Crime department operating solely within the District of Columbia - the project is only a test and not nationwide, and certainly not worldwide.  Well, riddle me this, Batman - how is it the Pre-Cogs ONLY have information about future murders only in DC?  That seems, even in a movie that begs the intellect and imagination, rather fanciful and absurd - even childishly obtuse.  You, the viewer, are expected to utterly disregard such a fundamental question.Going a step beyond, it has been expected as part of the project that it would be expanded to a national project - yet the selection of the Pre-Cogs was shown to be a singular, non-recurrent event.  Wouldn't the recruitment of more Pre-Cogs be needed?  But the movie makes it clear that would be impossible.  Spielberg is asking the viewer yet again to put his or her intellect and logic aside in order to make a simple plot point.Another key scene in the movie is Anderton returning to the Pre-Crime Laboratory in order to extract Agatha's hidden Minority Report - this after having been revealed as the perpetrator of a future murder and on the run from the Pre-Crime unit.  Admission to the Pre-Crime unit is secured by, among other things, a retinal scan of the person's eyes, so Cruise remembers to bring his previously extracted eyeballs with him (fortunately there is no such thing as decomposition in the future).  Well now...beside giving Spielberg the chance to include a cheap stunt scene (Cruise chasing his escaped eyeballs as they roll down a ramp), this allows Cruise entry into the facility.  Let's see...Cruise is on the run from the Pre-Crime Police, they are chasing him from a future murder....and DON'T TAKE HIM OFF THE ACCESS LIST FOR THE FACILITY???  HUH???????????  Why hasn't anyone mentioned such a childishly obvious problem in the logic and plausibility of this essential part of the plot?I'll address one more gaping flaw in the film's logical structure.  The movie rests on the idea that Cruise is an essentially good man framed in a future murder of someone who he does not know.  Cruise is intelligent, and savvy, and the plot draws inexorably toward him chasing the person to prove his innocence.  Didn't it occur to him to just STAY THE HELL AWAY from Les Crow???  He is even told to do so several times in the movie yet for reasons unexplained continues to pursue this person - HUH???????  Does Spielberg expect all of us to have been born on the same planet of mindlessness on which he was apparently born?  Well, I for one wasn't.  I'm surprised not to have read anyone offer these ridiculous holes in the movie's structure and premise.  I guess people just refuse to watch movies that Spielberg directs critically any more.And yes, the trademark sappy, over the top and absurd Spielberg happy ending is in full bloom in Minority Report.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002
L.A. Confidential," Great Noir Film
","L.A. Confidential is a wonderful piece of moviemaking with luminous characters, beautiful cinematography, convincing dialogue and a wonderful plot full of twists, turns and surprises.This is a perfect crime story and I would recommend it to anyone with a love for movies that are wonderfully made and acted.",10,1,1,2 January 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Just a big-budget, old-fashioned mess
","Frankly, this movie isn't worth an in-depth review. It's twice as long as it needs to be, it's consumed by overly loud and unnecessary special effects, there are far too many characters, none of which are adequately delineated, and the plot is puerile and childish at best.Jerry Bruckenheimer should be strung up by the ankles and stabbed to death with push pins for unleashing this three hours long bit of trash upon the world.Oh...and Keira? You need to add about thirty pounds to your frame, young lady. You are painfully emaciated and in your current physical condition horribly unattractive.",1,3,8,16 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Great debut!
","Sofia Coppola, whilst certainly taking advantage of her family connections to get this movie made, certainly stands on her own in writing and directing it.  It's an amazing character study of two complex individuals, who break all the Hollywood rules by NOT fornicating within ten minutes of meeting each other.Instead, we actually are treated to an observation of a relationship evolving and the characters' lives changing as they interact and as their friendship changes each other's outlook and perception of their lives.I've read numerous reviews below complaining that the movie is too long, that it moves too slowly, and that there's no plot.  Well...for y'all who are motivated by that rubbish there is plenty produced by Hollywood which will fill the bill for you.  Those of you 'gotta have it now' folks who don't appreciate subtlety and nuance will never stand a chance of grasping the value of a film like this which respects its audience and doesn't force feed the story/characters like pablum to an infant.Those of y'all interested in savoring a film with interesting characters who you haven't seen in every other Hollywood film, who are willing to take a movie on its own merits and just let it unfold, will find exceptional entertainment in this movie.  I heartily recommend it.",Null,0,1,4 March 2004
Meet Joe Black," No Doze, Anyone?
","Hmmmmm......Brad Pitt stares at the camera.  Brad Pitt displays a counterfeit Jamaican accent so irritating you'll wish Death to come knocking to relieve you of the tedium of this moronic 'morality' fable.That's not to mention the ponderous, humorless and patronizing tone of the film.  Pointless and lifeless, it wanders through three hours of your time (assuming you're dumb enough to waste it here).",2,1,2,15 November 1998
The Waterboy," Haven't seen it but geez...not even the ads are funny!
","I'm amazed at the uncritical comments I see posted here.  I have not (and will not) see this movie.  However, I've seen the trailers for this movie, and they are NOT funny, even by the reduced standards granted Adam Sandler. If you are one of the adoring Adam Sandler fans by all means go see this film.  I suppose that is healthier than hanging around his apartment building waiting for him to come out.However, for the rest of us, I can't imagine many films less worthy of $7 per seat.",Null,0,1,9 November 1998
