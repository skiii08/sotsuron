Minority Report," severely disappointing
","This movie joins the ranks of A.I. and Pearl Harbor as a film that looked promising from the previews and then ended up being immensely disappointing. And, like A.I., it is another case of a movie that could have been a decent conceptual or action flick, but was ruined by Steven Spielberg with excess sugary-sweet sentimentality. It mysteriously got great reviews, but I'm having trouble figuring out why.Firstly, the story is extremely creative and thought-provoking, but its execution falls short. Set in the future, Minority Report tells the story of an experimental new way of fighting crime, using three 'Pre-Cogs', or humanlike creatures who supposedly can see murders before they take place and provide the names of the killer and victim. In this way, the Pre-Crime unit can arrest the suspect before any crime is even committed, thus preventing murder from happening. It sounds like a great idea in theory, but alas, nothing is ever as perfect as it seems. The head of the Pre-Crime unit, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is shocked when his name turns up as the future killer of a man he's never even met, and spends the rest of the movie trying to get to the bottom of things.This is a great idea for a movie. There's so much to explore - the conflict between determinism and free will, for example, or the moral and legal implications of convicting someone for a crime that hasn't been committed yet. Add action sequences featuring vertically-flying cars, virtual reality, and jumps from high elevations, and its potential rises even more.But that's where the fun ends. Because that's where other elements come in. An ex-wife whose crying on cue is only slightly more nauseating than her sudden concern for her husband. A crazy old lady who has man-eating plants as a security system. A scene with eyeballs that can only be described as gratuitous grossness. Pre-cogs who spend most of the movie lying completely still, and then suddenly develop the ability to speak, interact, and have character traits and histories. All in all, the movie never really gets going and never really gets to where it could be.In other words, a serious disappointment.",3,5,9,5 February 2005
In Bruges," Dark comedy, great dialogue, fantastic setting, but not what you'd expect
","Went to see it for the setting. Loved it for the dialogue. Wished it had just gone a bit further.In Bruges is a dark comedy set in the beautiful medieval town of Bruges, Belgium, featuring an Irish duo of hit men who have been ordered by their boss to hide out there after a high-profile job in London went sour. Their instructions are to keep a low profile, sightsee, and generally avoid trouble until further notice.But all is not as it seems.The dialogue between Gleeson and Farrell is witty, delivered with perfect comic timing, zany, and a joy to watch. Farrell and the charming Clémence Poésy also have great chemistry and are fun to watch on screen. The humour is designed to make viewers uncomfortable, and succeeds remarkably on this count. If you're looking for political correctness, you won't find it here. What you will find are jabs at Americans, tourists, gays, blacks, whites, fat people, and oh yeah, midgets. As this odd assortment of characters mixes and mingles in the streets of Bruges, the tension builds.And there's just enough of a psychological dark edge to keep things interesting. This is a comedy, yes, but it's by no means light and fluffy. This movie has been compared to The Big Hit or The Whole Nine Yards, but in fact, it's much, much darker. And in my opinion, that makes it better.Shot entirely on location in Bruges, the backdrop is of course stunning. I originally went to see this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title, simply because, having visited Bruges, I couldn't resist an opportunity to see it on the big screen. Filmed in the wintertime and largely at night, Bruges itself is one of the stars of the movie. Like the other characters, it is not portrayed as light, airy, innocent or picturesque, the way it is in real life. Instead, its more haunting quality is captured elegantly on film, with a heavy mist giving the town a sort of eerie, dream-like quality.So much of this movie was just right, and I highly recommend it to people who like twisted humour and aren't easily offended.I have two issues with this film, however. The first is the score. The music is completely wrong for this movie, giving it a feel that doesn't work at all with the dark comedy tone. The melancholy, slow, stirring music would've worked nicely with a drama or a psychological period piece, but just seems out of place here.The second issue is with the ending. Nope, I won't give it away. Suffice to say, I thought it was wrong, wrong, wrong. All wrong. Almost as though the author couldn't figure out what to do next or how to end this thing.But overall, I really enjoyed In Bruges. It was wickedly funny, daringly different, and fantastically non-PC. And the shots of Bruges are wonderful. Despite what the main characters say about the place, Bruges is really quite wonderful. I suggest seeing both the movie and the city.",7,186,351,13 February 2008
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first one
","Very few sequels ever surpass the original film. Spiderman 2 is one of this select club of films that is actually better than the first one.Tobey Maguire continues to impress as an actor, putting to shame the initial critics when he was chosen for the role. He gives Spiderman depth, vulnerability and a certain boyish charm. Kirsten Dunst, while not one of my favourite actresses, turns in a decent performance.Sure, Doctor Octopus is a ridiculous villain. But this movie is about more than just the plot. The film-making has matured here. There is more subtlety to the execution of the scenes and the story.Spiderman 2 is a great action/adventure movie that's a lot of fun to watch. It probably ranks up there as one my favourite superhero movies of all time.",8,2,4,6 February 2005
Dead Poets Society," Carpe Diem
","Robin Williams' finest role is this wonderful movie that I have watched maybe a zillion times and will never grow tired of.A simple story of a teacher who comes into the lives of young students at a boys' preparatory school and 'shakes things up', this movie has been copied dozens of times since its release, and never quite as well. Robin Williams, as poetry teacher John Keating, tries to get the boys to think beyond algebra and chemistry and their acceptance to Harvard, and to start thinking for themselves. He urges them to 'seize the day' and take control of their lives. And in changing the way his students think, he also had a profound effect on me... and I suspect, on the life of anyone else fortunate enough to see this film.At once criticized for being a clichÃ© and hailed as an instant classic, Dead Poets Society is both... and neither. It is simply a film that makes you think, question, hope and dare to dream. I think most of us either knew someone who affected us in a similar way as teenagers, or wish we did. Yes, the movie is full of exaggerated clichÃ©s - but whose life isn't at that age? And yes, the movie has also achieved a sort of new classic status. Hopefully, the superlatives won't kill the essence that is this film.I've seen this compared to a lot of movies - mostly inferior ones made since, such as The Emperor's Club - but the best comparison I could come up with is to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Not for content, but for the underlying message... and consequently, for the movie's effect on people. Specifically, on me.If you haven't seen this, you're sorely missing out.",10,1,3,5 February 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Slow but poignant
","Brokeback Mountain is a simple, tragic love story.There, I've said it. Because, once you strip away all the media attention and hype surrounding this movie, that's all it is. No more, no less. It's a story of forbidden love, as old and as tragic as any Romeo-and-Juliet-based tale. And if it weren't for the fact that it was about a couple of dudes, most people probably would have never heard of it. (After all, how many of you saw 'The Shipping News'?) It's well-acted, to be sure. Jake Gyllenhaal is particularly good as Jack, and the absolutely gorgeous Heath Ledger holds his own pretty well as Ennis, despite a disastrous attempt at a Wyoming accent. The interplay between the two is mostly non-verbal and is well done.The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery (mostly filmed in Alberta, Canada) is gorgeous, and there is fantastic use of symbolism. Yes, it's a bit slow at times, and yes, it's quite sad, but it is really a beautiful movie when it comes down to it.It's a real shame that this movie will be most remembered for a couple of sex scenes in a tent. Because it's about so much more than that. Love, loss, passion, jealousy, uneven relationships, hope and despair - all universal human emotions that have nothing to do with sexual orientation. With all the talk about gay rights and equality, I think that there will only truly be equality when we can judge a love story - gay or straight - on its own merits. And this one certainly passes the test.",8,10,12,23 December 2006
Lost in Translation," Yawn... overrated
","I don't get what so many people loved about this movie. I kept waiting for something to happen... but nothing ever did! It was literally one of the most boring films I have seen in my life.Oh, I understand that it's supposed to be about alienation. I realize that it stars Scarlett Johanssen, the 'it' girl of the moment, and is set in Tokyo for cool visual effect. That's all very well and good.But then what? Some semblance of a plot might be nice here. Am I the only one who fell asleep watching this, waiting for something - anything - to happen? I have to say, this is one of the most overrated films of all time. Snooze.",4,4,9,6 February 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Devilishly unfunny
","This movie generated so much buzz when it came out that I initially resisted seeing it. Now that I finally did, I can't help but wonder what all the hype was about.Starring Meryl Streep opposite Anne Hathaway, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is loosely based on the book by the same name, and was billed as a funny-but-edgy insider's look into the cutthroat world of fashion. Instead, it is a fairly pedestrian teen movie, built along the lines of 'She's All That' or its million predecessors, where the plain Jane girl gets a makeover and all her dreams come true. Or something.Because the message itself gets a little lost here. Ostensibly, this movie is supposed to tell us that the world of fashion is evil, superficial, full of back-stabbers and snotty 'clackers', and utterly devoid of any true meaning or purpose. But simultaneously, it tries to elevate fashion to a worthy pursuit on the same level as, say, curing AIDS or fighting world poverty. In trying to at once pay homage to and dissect the fashion world, the movie succeeds at neither.Much has been said about the acting, namely, Meryl Streep's portrayal of her character. And while I agree that her deliberately understated performance elevated this movie to something beyond 'disaster', I'd hardly give her lavish praise. Simply put, she's not nearly 'devilish' enough. She's tough and, at first, snarky, but we never truly believe that she's evil. Driven, yes. Willing to step over people to get what she wants, sure. But evil?In fact, nobody is quite mean enough here. Emily Blunt's character is snooty but ultimately likable, and Stanley Tucci plays the kind of 'gal pal' every girl wishes she had. For a supposedly cutthroat world, people are falling all over themselves to help each other out. So much for the Devil.And Anne Hathaway is charming and all, but she is just horribly miscast as the ugly duckling. She's a gorgeous girl who looks like a fashion model wearing the designer clothing she struts around in most of the movie, but she looked stunning even before that 'makeover' and the suggested message was that the world of fashion has ridiculous, unrealistic standards. That said, the movie never really passes enough judgment on these standards. When her success at work leads her to drive away those closest to her, the movie portrays her in a sympathetic light, and her boyfriend and her friends are portrayed as simply jealous, as opposed to as real people who love her for who she is and not for what she wears. When Hathaway's character proudly boasts that she's dropped from a size 6 to a size 4, it's done in such a way to make viewers believe that this is actually a good thing! Far from inspiring people to do the right thing, I fear all this movie will inspire is an epidemic of anorexia among young girls.In the world of The Devil Wears Prada, there are no consequences, no shame, and no sore feet from running around town all day wearing ridiculous shoes. The plot is utterly ridiculous, including such impossible situations as Hathaway's character obtaining the (not yet written) manuscript to the seventh Harry Potter book. Can we at least stick to something with some semblance of reality here, people? Salma Hayek's adaptation of 'Betty La Fea' as 'Ugly Betty', starring America Ferrera, takes the same concept and does it quite a bit better, to tell the truth. I'd give this a skip and try watching the TV series instead; whatever its faults, at least it has a bit more heart than this mess.",4,55,87,23 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yoda is the only saving grace
","Attack of the Clones was not the most horrible movie I've ever seen. Far from it. In terms of mindless entertainment, it was actually a lot of fun, and it had lots of cool special effects like monsters with big teeth and talking robots, and of course, fight scenes involving clones. What could possibly be wrong with that? However, if you're a stickler for minor things like, oh, say, PLOT, then you might have a few problems with this one.Firstly, are we supposed to believe that Natalie Portman's Queen - er - Senator Amidala hasn't aged a day, but Anakin Skywalker has grown up maybe ten years, enough to turn this into a romance between them? Yeah RIGHT! Speaking of Anakin Skywalker, the only thing worse than Hayden Christinasen's acting was his hair extension. I mean, I realize his character was supposed to be a whiny brat, but, well, that gets extremely annoying to watch after two hours. And the stupid robot one-liners made everyone in the theatre groan out loud. I mean, 'I'm beside myself'? Come ON! Redeeming qualities? There are quite a few. The special effects are cool. The fight scenes are fun. Natalie Portman is charming as Amidala, and Samuel Jackson and Ewen McGregor deliver solid performances. And Yoda. Yoda. Yoda. Yoda. It's all about Yoda. (Oh, and did I mention Yoda?) The bottom line is that it was better than the Phantom Menace. As if that's saying much.",4,0,3,5 February 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," Harmless chick flick
","See this movie if you're female. But make it a girls' night out, and leave him at home. Don't say I didn't warn you.Bridget Jones is a neurotic, lonely, but ultimately likable character. She is a heavy smoker, a heavy drinker, a few pounds overweight, British, a terrible public speaker, and has terrible judgment when it comes to relationships, but these qualities only help make her human and make it easier for people to identify with her. Of course, the fact that her character is portrayed by the very un-British and un-fat Renee Zellweiger makes some of what she says a little hard to believe. Despite this, Zellweiger pulls off the role with charm and grace - not an easy feat.The story itself has no surprises. From the first five minutes, everyone in the theatre knew exactly how it would end. There's no exciting revelation or universal truth to this tale. It's a simple romantic story, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.Hugh Grant plays a fairly one-dimensional bad guy, and Colin Firth an equally flat good guy. Aside from the lead role, there are no noteworthy acting performances here.I haven't read the book, but I hear that some of the quirkiness is lost in the movie. In addition, the movie has some issues with the plot that just scream 'should have been cut out when adapted from book'. After a while, watching Bridget make the same mistakes over and over again gets a little tiresome. But ultimately, the story works.All in all, she's a likable heroine and we identify with her. The story is realistic and charming and, above all, harmless. It's a chick flick, but go see it if you're looking for a light laugh.",8,0,0,5 February 2005
10 Things I Hate About You," Cheesy but I love it anyway
","I'd be hard-pressed to justify liking what is essentially a blatant teen movie, but, well, I can't help it. I love this movie! It's got some great character acting, namely by Larry Miller as the father, Allison Janney as the guidance counselor and Daryl Mitchell as the English teacher. Julia Stiles comes across as believable. Heath Ledger is captivating (gotta love the accent!). The dialogue is witty and it's funny to boot. Besides, who can resist a school where a band performs on the roof? And to think it's based on Shakespeare! Predictable? Yes. Fun? Definitely. This is an eminently watchable, keep 'em laughing the whole time movie. 9/10.",9,0,0,7 February 2005
The Aviator," Okay but overrated
","The Aviator is an okay movie. I'd probably have enjoyed it a lot more if it hadn't been surrounded by so much Oscar buzz and hype, though.Let's start with the positives. The acting is fabulous. Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett both turn out excellent performances. It's movies like this one that serve to remind us that, despite Titanic, DiCaprio really can act.Viewed as a biography of Howard Hughes, this is an excellent movie. Viewed in terms of its storyline, it's a bit uneven at times. Still, I found The Aviator to be enjoyable and interesting. Worth seeing, yes. Worth buying on DVD? Probably not. 5/10.",5,1,1,6 February 2005
Cast Away," See this movie!
","Cast Away is Tom Hanks in his best role since Forrest Gump. It's the story of a FedEx man who gets stranded on a desert island after his plane crashes. Since the plot isn't all that eventful, I'd been expecting to be bored watching Tom Hanks talk to himself on an island for a long time.I couldn't have been more wrong. Cast Away is brilliantly acted and is even amazingly funny at certain moments. It's also the only movie I know of that has ever made me feel sorry for an inanimate object. And at times, I felt myself following the same thought processes as Tom Hanks' character, thinking I'd do things the same way he did in that situation.Tom Hanks gives an Oscar-worthy, memorable performance. My advice to everyone is simple: go see this movie!",9,0,1,5 February 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," A brilliant commentary on the American family
","Little Miss Sunshine is about a girl who wants to be Miss America.Well, sort of. Actually, it's really about a family that, despite consisting of the most messed-up cast of characters you might imagine, is actually relatively normal, in all the ways that count.A father terrified of failure, especially his own. A grandfather who likes loose women, crude language, and heroin. A brother who has taken a vow of silence until he gets his dream of entering the air force academy. A gay scholarly uncle who, after a bad breakup, has recently attempted suicide. A harried mother trying to hold everyone together. And oh yeah, a remarkably and refreshingly unspoiled little girl, who dreams in her own innocent way of being Miss America. Pile them all into a bright yellow VW bus with a broken clutch - and horn - as they try to rush Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and see what ensues.What does unfold is not only pure comedic gold, but also a refreshing commentary on family, values and the hypocrisy of the world in general. Without revealing too much, the movie's ending exposes this hypocrisy in such a spot-on way that it has audiences leaping to their feet and cheering.Way to go, Little Miss Sunshine! A must-see.",8,0,1,26 January 2008
American Beauty," This movie changed my life
","I know it sounds like a cliché, but this movie literally changed my life. They don't come around very often, but occasionally a movie can make you see life differently, and this movie is like that.Funny, sad, brilliantly acted, with fabulous scenes and memorable quotes... American Beauty is so much more than just a movie. This is a movie that takes on the big questions - the meaning of life, relationships, love, hate and courage... and does it in a way that seems somehow real and true without being forced.American Beauty deserved all the praise it got, and then some. And occasionally, I know this sounds cheesy but I find myself sometimes stopping and just appreciating a simple moment for its beauty. This is the only world we have, and life is sometimes a mess but who of us would have it any other way?Go see this movie!!!",10,1,2,5 February 2005
Save the Last Dance," Trite and poorly written
","This movie is a sort of updated Romeo and Juliet- meets- Dirty Dancing, and attempts to take on the complex issues surrounding racism and stereotypes while showcasing some fun dancing. Unfortunately, it fails on every level, thanks to a poor script that allows this movie to lapse into the many stereotypes it was hoping to dispel.The two leads - Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas - do what they can, but nobody could sell this drivel. The writing is cringe-worthy in many, many spots. At times, even the actors seem to be unable to believe that they're actually require to say some of the things that they say. Everyone in the film besides the leads speaks in the sort of 'gansta' talk that seems like a Hollywood/MTV notion of how kids really speak. Then there are the clichés: the teenage mothers, the drive-by shootings, the drug dealers and pretty much everything else you could think of.Even the dancing - the film's supposed highlight - is poorly shot, so you don't get to see the sequences properly. Stiles insisted on doing all her own ballet, rather than using a body double - an admirable sentiment, perhaps, but someone should've noticed that it made the whole subplot of her being good enough to audition for Julliard rather unbelievable when she's shown stumbling over even simple steps. The dance scenes at the club were so chopped up that the audience is denied even the simple pleasure of some great dance scenes to break up this saccharine, eye-rolling plot.Save The Last Dance could never have been a truly excellent movie, but it could have at least been fun and entertaining. But the writing was so terrible, it doesn't even achieve this goal.",3,14,23,12 August 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Good as a film but missing some crucial details
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But the director had a monumental challenge in adapting a book that most fans have read dozens of times and memorized down to the tiniest detail. Of course, even the slightest deviation from the book was going to be met with aghast cries from the Potter-obsessed. So instead of trying to cram everything into the movie, Cuaron went for style instead and tried to transplant his own vision, instead of Rowlings's, to the screen.For the most part he succeeded. I especially liked how the three main characters - wearing street clothes - had more natural interaction and seemed more like regular teenagers. And the visual effects and scenery were stunning.But there were some major plot holes that weren't explained, namely, the history of the Maurauders' Map everything that goes along with that, including the friendship between Harry's father and the other three. I found that that alone stopped this movie from being as good as it could have been.",7,0,0,9 June 2004
American History X," Disturbing and powerful
","American History X stars Edward Norton as a racist, xenophobic skinhead who is convicted of murder and sent to prison. It follows the effect of this on his family, specifically on his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, who idolizes him and yearns to follow in his footsteps.The movie is powerful and disturbing in the insider's look it gives us into the dark world of violent racist skinhead groups. For this reason, it is very difficult to watch. But it's an important film, because it tackles a subject that Hollywood is usually content to shy away from.Edward Norton, always one of my favourite actors, has one of his best roles of all time here. He is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Derek Vinyard, a character whose charisma and intelligence could have led him down pretty much any path, but who chose the wrong road. How many infamous men in history have had the exact same qualities? Countless. Norton embraces the role, wholly embodying the most terrible qualities of his character, and refusing to shy away from giving his all to even the most difficult scenes. He has even transformed his entire body to play this part (compare his muscular build here to his scrawniness in 'Fight Club', for instance). Norton is so believable, and so compelling to watch, that it's all too easy to see how he could have recruited and inspired so many people to his fanatically hateful ideology. Also brilliant is Avery Brooks as the schoolteacher who tries so hard to redeem Derek when most people would have written him off long ago. Notable among smaller roles are performances by Fairuza Balk as Vinyard's girlfriend and Beverly D'Angelo as his conflicted mother. This is a dramatic film, and the acting has made it what it is.My criticisms are few. Furlong's acting isn't quite as strong - at times it seems like he's reading lines aloud for a teacher. And without giving too much away, the ending comes across as a bit too contrived. At times, the movie skirts dangerously close to after-school-special territory, and it can be a bit heavy-handed in its preachiness. It's not a perfect film, by any means.But it's a provocative film, one that I urge parents to watch with their teenagers and that is sure to open up a lot of discussion. A must-see.",8,0,0,23 December 2006
Pearl Harbor," Laughably awful
","One of the most anticipated movies of the summer, Pearl Harbor had the opportunity to be an epic. But it failed miserably. The best description I can come up with for it is an unintentionally comedic, horribly Americanized, Titanic-meets-Top Gun.How exactly did this movie go wrong? Firstly, if you're looking for something historically accurate, don't bother. I'm not quite sure which war this movie was supposedly taking place during, because it sure wasn't World War II. Of course, if you like laughing at how idiotic Americans are, you have plenty of opportunities, for example, when one of the characters shouts 'I think World War II just started' - in 1941.The acting wasn't half bad, but unfortunately the actors had very little to work with. The love story, which takes up most of the movie, had a plot more ludicrous than any bad daytime soap opera. The basic premise is a love triangle set against the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Ben Affleck plays Rafe, an American pilot who signs up for the Eagle Squadron and goes to Britain to fight, leaving behind Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), his one true love. The plot is complicated when Danny (Josh Hartnett), his best friend from childhood, falls in love with Evelyn. Now, normally, I hate predictable movies, but this one would have been better off staying the course. Instead, its plot twists and and turns are so ridiculous, they turn the love story into a comedy routine.Not that this movie was all bad. It had its good points. The fight scenes in the planes, though short, were fun, as was seeing lots of ships get blown up. The special effects were definitely the highlight of the movie.Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor had far too little excitement and far too much stupidity. At over three hours, it was also far too long, especially considering how the entire battle at Pearl Harbor only lasted two hours in reality. It's really too bad, because with a cast including Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and the surprisingly talented Josh Hartnett, and one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century for material, it really should have been much better.",3,12,21,5 February 2005
Before Sunset," Really regret seeing it!
","'Before Sunrise' was one of my all-time favourite movies, but when I heard they were making a sequel, I was nervous. The open ending of the first installment was so note-perfect in leaving people free to draw their own conclusions about what happened that I didn't want it to be ruined. As such, I delayed seeing this as long as possible.I should have delayed longer. Much longer. Like, forever.Simply put, 'Before Sunset' takes a couple of intriguing, interesting, fully-drawn characters and turns them into insufferable cads, caught up in their own memories and having achieved nothing of note in their lives in ten years. It takes a beautiful, sweet chance romantic encounter and turns it into the cornerstone of these characters' lives. And it tries to make us believe that there's nothing better out there to hope for, ever. What a thoroughly depressing message! What injustice to these characters, who deserved a whole lot better! Of all the scenarios I ever imagined for these two, this was not it.The first movie was great because it was about two people meeting by chance and truly connecting. But in the second movie, we're led to believe that since then, neither of them has managed to connect with anyone else. Both are in unsatisfying relationships when they meet up again - that part is not that hard to believe. But what is depressing in a creepy stalker-ish sort of way is that Hawke's character has devoted years of his life to writing about Delpy's, and that Delpy's character has devoted a significant amount of time to seeking out Hawke's character for a reunion.Too, the movie downplays the thorny issue of marital infidelity and home-wrecking; people rooting for Hawke and Delpy to get back together should stop romanticizing everything and take a good hard look at the fact that they're cheering for a guy to leave (or at least cheat on) his wife and ditch his kid for a girl he had a one-night stand with nine years earlier. As for Delpy, she's writing and recording songs about a guy SHE had a one-night stand with. And neither of them quite realize the irony - that they're throwing away everything real in their lives in order to chase a fantasy that never really existed.The first movie was great precisely because the characters were practical about the circumstances of their meeting; they accepted the fact that their connection was strong but brief, and that long-distance relationships don't work, and that the future is unpredictable. But neither took their own advice - instead, it seems they have been living hollowed half-existences for the past nine years, just waiting to find each other again.And when they do, what exactly do they find? Is it realistic to think that these two will get along once they try to spend more than a single day together? It's all too obvious that they have nothing in common - even from the first movie, it's obvious that they differ politically, philosophically and culturally, and that the only reason they have such a great relationship is because it only lasts a night. By the second movie, they have grown even further apart on all those issues, plus they each carry around idealized, imaginary versions of one another that they have invented over a nine-year period and that will be impossible to live up to. Relationships - real relationships - are hard work, full of ups and downs, but they're *real*. What these two have isn't real. What they have is, well, just plain sad.If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge you not to, because once you have seen it, there's no going back. These characters deserve so much better - just use your imagination.",5,2,6,23 December 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A beautiful hodgepodge
","I have to disclaim this review by first explaining that it would not originally have been my choice of movies to go see. I don't usually pick Chinese Martial Arts movies out of a crowd. However, I'd heard from so many people how amazing it is, so I decided to see for myself.My opinion is mixed. The best parts of the movie are the visuals and special effects. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, resembling artistic dancing. The fantasy sequences of people flying and standing on treetops are especially breathtaking, as is the scenery and cinematography.The acting was also fairly good, with performances by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, among others. The only really noteworthy performance, in my opinion, was given by Zhang Ziyi as Jen, the confused daughter of the Governor. She came across as convincing in portraying a mix of naiveté, confusion, wistfulness, and prodigious talent, all hidden between a hostile exterior.Where the movie falls apart is with the plot. I found that it lacked direction, seeming to travel haphazardly in one direction and then another. Ask any writer or English teacher what makes a good story, and they'll reply that it has to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Seems simple, right? Well, that basic principle got lost somewhere along the way with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Characters change their missions almost by the minute. Flashbacks occur at odd times. The love stories seem to be thrown in simply to appeal to a Hollywood audience, without any real need for them in the plot. The result is somewhat of a hodgepodge.Of course, it's a beautiful hodgepodge to watch. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is worth seeing in theatres simply for the visuals. The bigger the screen, the better. It doesn't quite translate to DVD with quite the same effect.",7,1,3,5 February 2005
P.S. I Love You," Total tearjerker falsely billed as a romantic comedy
","I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it's sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues. Don't say I didn't warn you.",7,147,184,26 January 2008
School of Rock," Laughed till I cried, then came back for more
","The true test of a great movie is one that, months or years after its release, has me watching it again and again. School of Rock is just such a movie.It never pretends to be anything more than it is: a lighthearted, feel-good comedy, one of those teacher-inspires-kids plots with a twist, sort of a Sister Act II with Jack Black instead of Whoopi Goldberg (a vast improvement if you ask me). Nothing we haven't seen or heard before, but a great script, some enthusiasm, kids with actual talent, and Jack Black's natural zaniness make this movie work. And you know what? It's actually funny. As in, really, really funny.Jack Black is one of those actors who you can just wind up and let go with a script, and he'll take it to a whole new level. His enthusiasm is contagious, and the audience gets as caught up in it as the kids. Joan Cusack is laugh-out-loud funny in her role as the foil/school principal. And the music ain't half bad either.Okay, so the plot is unrealistic, the movie's about as deep as a frat boy, and there is very little to learn here about the human condition. But here's a movie that doesn't promise anything other than to entertain. And entertain it does.",7,1,2,27 January 2008
Coyote Ugly," Just plain awful!
","Does any of this sound familiar: Small-town girl goes to big city to pursue her dreams. Small-town girl faces obstacles in the big bad city. Girl meets some tough-talking friends and does some ethically questionable things in pursuit of her dreams. Girl meets perfect guy who sweeps her off her feet and believes in her. Girl makes all her dreams come true.If you've heard it all before, you're not alone. 'Coyote Ugly' breaks no new ground, takes no risks, and doesn't even have any decent acting to redeem the movie. It's almost painful to watch Piper Perabo trying to decide whether her character is tough-and-sexy or sweet-and-innocent. She gets neither quite right, and in truth should've just gone for 'porn star' because that's how she comes across.The script is laughably awful, containing lines that surely made movie audiences across the nation groan aloud and roll their eyes. The plot - such as it is - is utterly unrealistic and offers us nothing in the way of insight, profound thinking, or even lighthearted laughs. Some men (mostly teenaged boys) may like this because it features good-looking women dancing on a bar... but even those scenes are fairly tame compared to most of what you'd find in your average PG-rated flick these days. The movie sets back the cause of empowerment of women by at least five decades. Oh, and the soundtrack blows. In fact, there are almost no redeeming qualities here whatsoever.So why the three stars? I'll give one star alone to Maria Bello for her performance as the bar owner who turns out to have a heart under her tough-as-nails exterior. And I'll give another star to the dance sequences, which, while tame, were at least fun and mildly energetic. The final one is for John Goodman, who has one of his worst roles here, but is a cut above anything else in this mess.Two hours of my life I wish I could have back.",3,1,2,23 December 2006
The Illusionist," Beautiful, unusual and eminently watchable
","Is there any acting role that the fantastically talented Edward Norton can't pull off? In 'The Illusionist', he takes on the role of Eisenheim, the turn-of-the-century Viennese magician and entertainer who gets caught up in a love triangle. And what we get as an audience is a real treat: A beautifully-shot, superbly acted, mind-bending mystery and love story.The plot is at once simple and complex. On its face, it's a basic love triangle between Eisenheim, his childhood love, the Duchess Sophie, and her fiancé, who just so happens to be the Crown Prince (and who has a streak of jealousy and a nasty temper). Eisenheim and Sophie reconnect after she attends one of his performances, and the tension builds as the audience is left to wonder how the whole thing will play out.Edward Norton plays Eisenheim as an inscrutable, mysterious man who can speak volumes with his eyes. Paul Giamatti is a pleasant surprise in his role as the not-entirely-corrupt Chief Inspector Uhl. And Rufus Sewell is a treat as the villain in the movie, Crown Prince Leopold.The one thing that threatened to ruin this movie for me was the casting of Jessica Biel as Sophie. A lot of people maintain that this movie proves her acting ability; I disagree. She was wooden, cardboard almost, and her performance looked ridiculously amateurish next to the skills of Norton and company. Sorry, guys, I know you might like to look at her, but she can't act.Besides that, this is a fantastic movie and is highly worth seeing. No, I won't ruin the ending for you, if you haven't been spoiled already. But I will say that, unlike the Sixth Sense, this movie is an enjoyable journey whether or not you see the destination coming.8/10. Quality.",8,1,1,14 October 2007
Garden State," Deceptively simple
","I went to see this mainly because I love Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. I wasn't disappointed, but at the time, the impression I formed was that this was a simple romance movie between two quirky characters. Well-acted, good lines, good soundtrack... but pretty average.But the movie stuck in my head. It had an effect on me that I didn't initially anticipate. And I realized that 'Garden State' only pretends to be simple. This is a movie that, like an onion, has layers that only can be peeled back over time. It stuck with me maybe because there was so much I could identify with - which may sound odd, given that my life is nothing like Andrew's or Sam's. But families are strange. Relationships are hard. Life can be difficult to face. And home is such an abstract concept, but it's so fundamentally real.The best part about 'Garden State' is that it makes you feel something, without being obvious about it. This is a change-your-life kind of movie - but quietly, subtly. It just alters your perception of the small, everyday aspects of life in such a small way it's hardly noticeable, but in such a major way as well.Highly recommended.",9,0,1,5 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Thank you, David Yates, for the best HP film yet!
","It was with significant trepidation that I went to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I'd been somewhat disappointed with Alfonso Cuaron's PoA's film adaptation, and severely disappointed (even angered) by the travesty that was Mike Newell's vision of Hogwarts in GoF. OOTP is my favourite book of the series, and I was worried that the plot, characterization and overall film wouldn't be true to JK Rowling's vision.Well, I needn't have worried. Director David Yates pulled this off in a way that had me grinning throughout the entire movie, because it was clear from the opening titles right through the closing credits, here, finally, is a man who 'gets it'.Thank you, Mr Yates, for directing the young stars in such a way that fits their age. The awkward interactions between Harry and Cho, the conflicts within Harry himself, Neville's transformation, even Luna's dreaminess, all well-executed. He even managed to rein in the chemistry between Dan Radcliffe and Emma Watson that was leaping off the page in the previous two movies, recognizing - as any true fan would - that despite the actors' obvious affinity for one another, it's really Ron that Hermione is supposed to be falling for. Watson still has virtually no chemistry with Rupert Grint, but at least an attempt was made at giving them more interaction to set up the plot line for later.Thank you, thank you, thank you Mr Yates, for restoring my Dumbledore! I'd been unimpressed with Michael Gambon in the third movie, downright horrified with him in the fourth, but it was clear from this movie that the man can act, he just needs better direction. Here, he got it, and returned to being the Dumbledore we all know, love and trust.Thank you, Imelda Staunton, for bringing Dolores Umbridge to life, exactly as evil and as nuanced as she should be. Her performance was pitch-perfect every step of the way.Thank you, Mr Yates, for the attention to background detail. While I recognize that it's impossible to put every single subplot from the book into a movie, you managed to condense pages and pages from the book into corners of the screen in such a way that made us feel like we weren't missing anything.Thank you to the set designers, editors, animators and directors, for bringing to life the Ministry of Magic in such a stunning way, exactly how I pictured it. Seeing the movie in IMAX 3D was well worth it for the amazing scenes at the Ministry, but even the non-3D scenes were beautifully executed.No doubt, people are angry at the changes and omissions to the plot. That has been me for every book so far, especially the last one. But here, I found I didn't mind so much. The scenes didn't feel rushed, and the movie made sense as a stand-alone. (One of the friends I saw it with hadn't read the book, and I found there was next to nothing that I had to explain later to her; she'd understood it all from the movie. This was certainly *not* the case in GoF). What changes were made were done for a reason, and I felt they stayed true to the spirit of the book, bringing to life what was most important and simplifying some elements that were less critical. The story was well told, and essence of the movie was very true to the book, while still making sure not to rush through scenes or sacrifice emotion for the sake of action.David Yates is the first director of a Harry Potter film since Chris Columbus's to truly get it. I'm relieved and thrilled that this movie was so great, and am glad to hear that Mr Yates will be staying on to direct HPB.A must-see for any fan and also for any skeptic. 8/10.",8,0,0,14 July 2007
A Beautiful Mind," What is reality?
","This is a superb movie that is both a pleasure to watch and a lot of fun to contemplate afterwards.A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who also happens to be schizophrenic. Those of you who have taken introductory microeconomics might remember vaguely something about Nash Equilibrium (it took me two thirds of the movie to make the connection) but that's hardly important. The movie stays away from the math for the most part, preferring to focus on how Nash saw the world as opposed to what he did. Although at two and a half hours, the movie is relatively long, I honestly didn't notice until I left the theatre and checked my watch. I was astonished to see that so much time had passed because the movie kept me captivated.Russell Crowe's performance was nothing short of extraordinary. Jennifer Connelly was fine in her role, as were many of the supporting actors, but none particularly stood out compared to Crowe.Where this movie truly stood out, however, was where it forced audiences to question how we define reality. What exactly is real? What isn't? Is seeing believing? Does reality exist only in the mind? A Beautiful Mind has been criticized for turning fact into fiction and taking broad liberties from the true life of John Nash. This may very well be true. As an autobiography, it likely falls far short of factual. However, it has considerable artistic merit in its own right, fact or no fact. After all, what is truth? The movie also glosses over some things that could have been further developed, such as Nash's struggle to overcome his illness. Plus, his relationship with wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) comes off as fairly implausible. She is too supportive; he never gives anything to the relationship, even at first. And the ending comes off a wee bit too sentimental for my taste.Bottom line, though? Go see this movie. It is brilliant and definitely worth the watch.",8,0,1,5 February 2005
The Holiday," Harmless but forgettable holiday fluff
","This was a cute movie, based on a completely contrived only-in-the-movies plot about two women - one British (Kate Winslet) and one American (Cameron Diaz) who decide impulsively to swap houses for two weeks over Christmas. What follows is a lighthearted film showing the two women finding love, laughter and themselves while living in each other's countries and, to some degree, lives.What this movie has going for it is plenty of eye candy (Jude Law looks great here, ladies), a few cute subplots, and a lot of humorous - if not particularly original - moments. It's cute, period. It's not smart, it's not sassy, it's not stylish in any way. It doesn't try to be any more than it is. It doesn't make too much of an effort at believability or realistic plot turns, and if you watch this, you're better off just letting the plot holes slide without too much analysis.And it certainly doesn't try to answer any of the big questions it could potentially open up, specifically, about long-distance relationships and whether they could ever work. The ending is unsatisfying for precisely this reason. We never really learn anything about life, love or the nature of relationships. It's a fuzzy, feel-good ending complete with singing and dancing, but no real answers.Enjoyable... as long as you shut your brain off. And will be forgotten by spring. 5/10.",5,0,1,27 December 2006
Love Actually," Could have used a few less subplots
","This was actually a pleasant surprise. If you can suspend disbelief long enough to buy Hugh Grant as Prime Minister of England, and you believe that the PM's job is so un-demanding that he's got nothing better to do than dance around in his underwear and pursue romance with pretty staffers, then this movie may be for you.As ensemble casts go, this one pretty much puts all preceding movies to shame. The question isn't who is in this movie, but rather who *isn't* in this movie? There is some great talent here, including Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley... the problem is, the cast list just goes on and on, leaving each of the actors with only a few short scenes in which to develop their characters. Quite simply, the movie just tries to do too much.There are some memorable sub-plots (Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, Bill Nighy as a washed-up popstar itching for a comeback, Liam Neeson as a recently widowed father, etc. But there are others that just seem thrown in for no particular reason. Yes, the stories are all interconnected, as it turns out, but you never spend enough time with most of the characters to really ever care about them or to bother trying to sort out how the connections work.One of the best parts of the movie involves the amazingly talented-for-her-age Olivia Olsen belting out a Mariah Carey song so well that she made me overlook the fact that it was a Mariah Carey song. It's hard to believe that she was only ten years old when she did the part.Saccharine, sugary-sweet and light, this is a perfect date movie. Just don't expect to discover any deep revelations about life or even about love. All in all, this is a decent movie. But with a few less subplots, the main characters could have been much more fully developed... and it could have been a much better movie.",7,0,2,21 February 2005
Hitch," I haven't laughed so hard in ages
","I was expecting this Will Smith movie about a guy who runs a business helping other guys get dates to be mindless and idiotic. Which, it was. But it was also surprisingly very, very funny.Will Smith, who has that 'nice guy' kind of appeal, is believable and down-to-earth as Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, a guy who has all the answers when it comes to other people's romantic problems, but none of them when it comes to his own attraction to his perfect match, Sara (Eva Mendes). In the meantime, he plays cupid for a klutzy, socially awkward accountant and a beautiful heiress. The storyline has that 'yeah, right' factor - but then, nothing about this movie is supposed to be realistic.I entered the theatre skeptical. But scene after scene induced side-splitting laughter, and gradually I had to admit to myself that this is pretty good comedy. No, the movie doesn't contain any social statements or earth-shattering revelations about humanity. But it made me laugh harder than I had in ages, and for that alone it's worth seeing.",7,0,2,10 April 2005
The Terminal," Fanciful and disappointing
","Steven Spielberg had a mega-hit with E.T. in the early 80s... and, with few exceptions (e.g. Schindler's List) he's been remaking the same movie ever since. It seems with The Terminal that he's proved himself incapable of making much else.This time, Tom Hanks plays a man from a remote Slavic country who is trapped in a New York airport terminal when a revolution in his country invalidates his passport. A wholly unrealistic premise, except it's based on a true story. The problem is, instead of using the true story as a real basis for an important film, Spielberg instead tries to turn a serious plight into a fanciful fairy tale.Tom Hanks, who is an eminently capable actor, gets very little chance on screen to develop his character into a true human being, distraught and frightened as anyone would be under these circumstances. He never seems frustrated or fed up with the bureaucratic red tape that is essentially holding him hostage. He is unbelievably patient, choosing to adopt a happy-go-lucky existence paying for food with quarters from the cart return machines, making friends with airport employees, and chasing romance with a flighty stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. You never really understand Hanks's character's motives or inner thoughts. He's just this inexplicably resourceful, patient, plucky man who arouses some curiosity among the people around him.Stanley Tucci, also normally a capable actor, plays the bad-guy immigration supervisor who has made it his personal crusade to keep Tom Hanks from setting foot on American soil. This lends an air of incredulity to the whole thing, because you get the sense that Hanks is not being kept prisoner due to a bureaucratic mix-up, but due to a small, petty man who would never have so much power in reality. Language barrier or not, it is completely unrealistic to think that anyone would simply sit in an airport for months without trying to contact diplomatic channels, other immigration offices, or even his family or friends back home.The acting is appalling, unfortunately, considering the talent lined up in the movie. There are some fun peripheral characters, but they just adopt the stereotypes of amusing foreigners without ever seeming real. Catherine Zeta-Jones is ridiculous as Hanks's love interest, playing a character that anyone in their right mind would run away from in a heartbeat. The romance between the two is phony and contrived.Most importantly, this movie had a chance to really say something - about immigration laws, about red tape, about institutionalization... about pretty much anything. Unfortunately, it chose to turn itself into a piece of fluff. And uninspired fluff at that.Highly disappointing. 4/10.",4,1,3,21 February 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," One of my all-time favourite movies
","What can I say about Shawshank that hasn't already been said? This is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I've seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for more.Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spirit.In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo's Nest; Andy's effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy's effect on the mental patients. And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratched-like character, full of self-righteousness and a kind of indignation at having to 'teach them a lesson'.Simple story or not, this movie is uplifting and inspiring. Wonderfully acted and directed, Shawshank's status as a classic is well-deserved.",10,2,4,5 February 2005
Before Sunrise," Honest and touching
","'Before Sunrise' is the story of two strangers - an American tourist (Ethan Hawke) and a French university student (Julie Delpy) who meet on a train to Vienna. Their fleeting time together evolves into romantic interest and they get off the train and spend a night together touring Vienna.The plot, however, says little about the essence of this gem of a movie. Because what we have here is one of the most true, honest looks at what happens when two strangers meet and connect - really connect - that has ever been captured on film.All too often, we talk to people we encounter without truly listening. We anticipate what they're going to say before they even say it, and we talk about superficialities just to fill the silence. What Hawke and Delpy manage to do in 'Before Sunrise' is something altogether different. They really connect, in a way that is at once fleeting but incredibly deep and meaningful.What we're used to seeing in movies is a fast-paced plot and dialogue that carries a scene. In love stories, we rarely get to see why two characters fall in love, or what they actually talk about. Often movies skip over the happy scenes, showing characters strolling hand in hand with ice cream while a pop song plays on the soundtrack. We see them talking and laughing but we never know what it is that they are talking or laughing about. The subtle message is that it doesn't matter.'Before Sunrise' tells us that it does matter. It matters more than anything. Because we see all the dialogue between these characters, including the awkward silences, the fillers, the so-called meaningless conversation that most other movies would skip over.There are some tangential characters that the two encounter, and there's some scenery (Vienna is of course the setting and it's a beautiful city) but all of that is peripheral; the movie focuses on the two characters and their interactions together. There is no formula here, no neat-as-a-bow happy endings. No, these are real people, sharing their views and thoughts and hopes and dreams. We never learn much about them in terms of biographical details. They don't share their resumes the way so many strangers do when they meet. No, theirs is a connection at a deeper level.This movie stayed with me because I felt it was so realistic and true-to-life. It's also a little sad; what does it really mean if you meet someone and connect like that and then maybe never see them again? What are we after if not a connection like that? But on the other hand, that's why it works so well. We see many instances where the two characters clash on views and outlooks and politics and philosophies, but because their time together is so fleeting, none of these things become issues. We get the sense that a long-term relationship between them would never work, but that the chance one day encounter is going to stay with them forever.In fact, though I'm told the sequel ('Before Sunset') is fantastic, I'm reluctant to see it. I prefer to see the ending as open, because it was so perfect in the context of the film.'Before Sunrise' is an honest, touching, wonderfully acted film that is sure to captivate anyone who sees it. Highly recommended.",10,4,7,21 February 2005
Mad Max: Fury Road," Basically just one long chase scene
","This movie is getting so much hype and buzz that people would have you believe it's Oscar-worthy. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. I was bored after the first half hour. Zero character development, the barest minimum of backstory, a silly plot that is essentially one big U-turn, and no acting to speak of. All the bad guys are faceless and nameless, and the good guys aren't much better. It's like playing a shoot 'em up video game where you just go through scores and scores of identical bad guys, blow up lots of things, face off with the big boss, and rescue the princess(es) by the end. It takes summer blockbuster to a new low -- I mean, the special effect action movies tend to at least have some likable characters and a little bit of humour and maybe some decent one-liners, but this has none of the above. Unless you like watching two hours straight of things exploding, this isn't for you. Two stars for the beautiful Namibia scenery and one star for Charlize Theron, but that's it.",3,12,34,17 May 2015
Atonement," Disappointing
","When the book 'Atonement' was getting so much buzz, I read it, expecting great things. What I was left with was a feeling of 'is that all?' It was an okay book, even intriguing at times, with a nice use of language and description. But I felt it was a rather bloated, overlong way to make what is essentially a simple point: Don't lie.That's probably why I didn't rush out to see the movie. But with all the Oscar buzz it was getting, I figured, why not? What works well as slow in a novel doesn't necessarily translate well to screen at the same slow pacing. A movie needs to have pacing, character development, something to hold attention. This just didn't do it. I thought the performances were just humdrum, even Keira Knightley, who has the ability to be so much better. The actresses playing Briony didn't accomplish much other than looking vaguely alike. And we never really get an opportunity to understand the romance between Cee and Robbie; it begins with a crude letter, peaks with one hasty sexual encounter, and then drops off into oblivion.The direction, cinematography and musical score are all excellent, and I could spend all day watching the beautiful costumes and scenery. But I really found this movie merely mediocre overall. I can usually tell after exiting a movie theatre whether a movie will be one that I'll want to re-watch again and again. Atonement, I could instantly tell, would be a one-shot deal.",5,14,27,26 January 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Funny, but don't expect it to be typical
","The Coen Brothers are weird.If you take this as a known going into the movie, it will certainly help you know what to expect. That is, expect the unexpected.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a tale about three escaped convicts who are racing against time to get to a treasure. On the way, they encounter all sorts of colourful characters and do all sorts of interesting things. It is loosely based on The Odyssey, but since I've never actually read The Odyssey it would be difficult for me to draw parallels.Parodies of everyone from Robert Johnson to the Carter Family show up at some point. There are hillbilly rednecks, a political election, a blind prophet, religious fanatics, some hooded KKK members, and a bunch of pyromaniacs with a penchant for killing.Somehow in this hodgepodge, a plot (and I use the term loosely) gets strung together. However, this movie isn't about the plot, nor is it about the acting, even despite George Clooney's golden globe award. Each time his accent slipped I questioned how well he deserved that one. But none of that was the point. The bottom line is, this movie is very, very funny.Of course, being able to pick out some of the references helps. I admit that I probably missed most of them, since many were very obscure, but there was still enough humour in there to entertain almost anyone.Just don't go into the movie expecting something typical, because O Brother, Where Art Thou? is anything but.",6,0,1,5 February 2005
