Deepwater Horizon," Good movie but not emotionally draining like The Lone Survivor.
","Based on a New York Times article, 'Deepwater Horizon's Final Hours', this film attempt to memorialize the tragedy in red, white, and blue unfortunately speaks to the slender nature of its source, in as much as its plot is essentially nil. Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) routinely boards the rig, leaving his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter on shore. On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole. Things turn from bad to worse as BP's Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich), aggrieved at being behind schedule and over budget, eschews the necessary concrete test and excuses a failed systems test in order to proceed with further drilling. Pretty soon, he looks like a jackass when the whole rig explodes in his face.And after that the film is just Wahlberg running around in a frenzy trying to get people off the rig and because of that they forgot to attached the characters to the viewers that the viewers didn't care anymore to watch the actual video of Deepwater Horizon after the film. 3 over 5. Competently made, more explosion and intense but not a pretty picture.",6,11,20,5 October 2016

Doctor Strange," A must see movie in IMAX 3D
",Doctor Strange doesn't care much on character arcs and splats everything the plot wants the audience to absorb just like the spells they're casting on screen and the upside down sequences that made me dizzy.The 3D really works. Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job as Doctor Strange. I don't feel the movie as a whole yet I'm excited on what Doctor Strange and the Time Infinity Stone fate will be on the next avengers film. Can't wait how the Russo bros will use his powers for INFINITY WAR. The possibilities are endless.3.5 over 5 star! Jaw dropping Visuals!,7,7,14,26 October 2016
Don't Breathe," Home invasion that you will never forget!
",Don't Breathe on point title for this movie plot directed by Fede Alvarez! Their is no spotlight to the cast all cast are performed extremely well and you will feel that every single BREATHE they take in this movie. The Cinematography in the dark is just 'WOW' and you can feel the critics said about this movie 'Greatest American horror film in 20 years.' But I have one problem to this movie is one of the character is hard to die it's just like the other fail horror film that the main character or the killer are hard to die when you shoot him/her in any parts of the body or smashed him/her in the head or any parts of the body he/she still alive!3.5over5 A nearly perfect film but because of the problem I saw every single horror film the 3.5over5 are fine!,8,4,10,2 September 2016
Sausage Party," Sorry to say but the sausage is expired!
","Sausage Party directed by Conrad Vernon (director of Shrek, Monster vs. Aliens and Madascar) and Greg Tiernan (director of Thomas and Friends) is all about foods that live in the supermarket and they believed that we humans are Gods that when we put them in the cart and we buy them they will go to the promised land but they are wrong!Not funny as I thought it would be! I love the concept of the movie but not the plot, I think the plot can fit in 8 minutes run not a 88 minutes run. One thing that I loved about this film is the ending that's all!1.5 over 5 star! Don't waste your money to this movie, just wait it in your television!",3,9,21,28 September 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," The Pet Story
","When I first saw the trailer the first thing I said was 'I think I'm totally sold by this movie.' because I'm a pet lover and when I was a kid I'm always said to myself what pets do when we are not at home or what they are thinking about us.The Secret life of Pets is all about Max and his animal friends. Max (Louis C.K) is a terrier dog living quietly with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his owner. But the happy life of Max and his friends are interrupted by Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a large, brown shaggy mongrel. Max get jealous to Duke because Katie have a larger focus on Duke. So Duke tricks Max into the city because Max do not have a big city experience and they both caught by Animal Control but they both rescued by a rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart) the leader of 'The Flushed Pets', a cult who hates humans.Yep I spoil you but not enough because as you can see the plot is the same plot to Toy Story when Buzz Lightyear introduce to Woody and friends so the adventure begins so as you can see when Duke introduced to Max the adventure begins too! The first 25 minutes showed potential but it was all down hill from there and all the funny things about this movie were included in the trailer so no surprise at all..The Secret Life of Pets is fun for kids; but missing is that emotional sting where no matter your age.2 over 5 stars The Secret Life of Pets is not for big boys and they should rename it 'The Pet Story' it would be better that way!",3,5,11,24 August 2016
