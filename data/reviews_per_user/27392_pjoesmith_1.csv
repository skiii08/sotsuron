Raiders of the Lost Ark," My favorite movie experience ever!
","With respect to the mission of IMDb, sometimes being informed (in any way) about a movie lessens the experience. I say this because of my experience with Raiders Of The Lost Ark.This was one of the few movies I watched without having any expectations. I was 19 years old at the time. The movie had just come out, and I knew nothing about the plot beforehand ... I didn't even know others opinions about whether it was good or not. This total ignorance allows me to say this as a certainty ... when it comes to seeing a great movie, sometimes ignorance is indeed bliss! This was (by far) my favorite movie experience of all time.This is one film I don't want to ruin by talking about it ... so let me just say this: if you ever happen to encounter a young man (say 18 or 19 years old) who has never heard of Indiana Jones, do him a favor. Don't tell him anything about the movie, invite him to a nice home theater, be sure to give him a soft-drink and some popcorn before the movie starts, turn up the volume and sit back & watch 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark'. I'm sure he'll long remember that great day.",10,2,4,3 April 2010
