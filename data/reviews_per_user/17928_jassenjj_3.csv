Blade Runner 2049," Soulles, boring and plastic
","Well, I just decided to review this, because I wasted 2 hours of my life (yes, I didn't get to the finish). Long story - short: this is a sequence of scenes lacking reasoning, depth, cohesion and sense.Nice visuals, not much effort on the music. I see the point of loud metal sounds here and there to awake all fallen asleep.",1,3,6,27 December 2017
Hereditary," Not just a horror
","The movie goes far beyond the usual horror movie. Impeccable acting, very psychological and philosophical focus on life choices, destiny and existence. Somewhat disappointing ending but it really didn't matter what exactly would happen in the last 5 minutes.Definitely highly recommended.",10,1,1,21 April 2020
Interstellar," A paradoxical movie in many ways
","The movie delivers some remarkable achievements in cinematography but it cannot be saved. It's naive, boring, silly, tearful and brings the irksome feeling that a decent filming and acting were wasted on a messy story that can be digested only if one leaves aside all their critical thinking. I'm still wondering what is the big flaw of the storyline: is it the fact that it's made out of air, so thin that it resembles vacuum, or is it the super-fast delivery of the space-time-anomaly-behind-the-library explanation of the whole point, right after the ridiculous safe-exit-from-a-spacecraft-inside-a-black-hole drama.Given the overall score here and the reaction of people around me, this movie is a paradox... It provokes contrasting opinions, so inexplicable to the opponent, that it reminds me of #thedress.",4,7,12,31 March 2015
