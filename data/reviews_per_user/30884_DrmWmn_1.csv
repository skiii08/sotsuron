Insidious: Chapter 2," A Wasted Opportunity
","This movie is what so many of today's horror movies have become: a collection of incoherent scenarios that seek to over explain the story and background to the audience.It starts off with a long, dragged out scene helping us revisit Josh's past. While I was sitting there on the edge of my seat, waiting for some sort of encounter with the Bride in Black, it ended up bringing nothing to the table. In fact, this exact scene gets revisited later on in the movie.This film contradicts itself and dumbs down the characters. Remember what the wife saw in the camera at the end of the first one? Good for you because apparently she doesn't. Instead she just accepts her husband as being her husband.Let's throw in too many unintentionally funny scenes, an all too coincidental look at the history of Josh and the Bride in Black, mixed with cluttered sets and lack of suspense, and what do you have?Insidious 2.",2,2,4,19 September 2013
