Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Homage to Kung Fu
",in the panultamate showdown between 'the bride' and bill you were led to believe that it would be a long complex battle. yet instead we see minimal contact between the 2 and just a little sword play.i believe that Tarantino did this because of David Carradine's (Bill) 70's show Kung Fu where he played the shaolin monk traveling around the 'Wild West' looking for his brother. the fight sequences in the show with Carradine were rubbish and were shot in a POV way in order to disguise Carradine's non existant martial art skills and i believe this is probably also the case in Kill Bill V.2.......Feedback? FACT/Bruce Lee co wrote the show Kung Fu and was supposed to play Carradine's character.That would have been amazing if it came into being.,9,1,2,5 May 2004
The Breakfast Club," Whatever happened to Anthony Michael Hall?
","The sheer idea for this 80's epic The Breakfast Club (1985) is a very simple concept about how five American teenage students were faced with spending a Saturday together in detention at their local school. Director/writer/producer John Hughes took this everyday scenario and transformed it into a film that highlights many questions, which the average teenager faces in those 'troublesome years'. It's a story about how these five students whom to the outside world were simply seen as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal could somehow find a common ground and become good, firm friends. The students address major ideological issues such as sex, drugs, generation gaps and the pressure to succeed. As with all 80's films, which target the teen audience, the soundtrack boasts an impressive ensemble of raw talent in the form of the hit single 'Don't You' by Simple Minds and includes hits from Wang Chung among others. I liked the fact that very little effects were used (except for Emilio Estefez's legendary dance sequence) this added to the realism. Also its slow paced narrative was true to how real life is and the fact that things don't occur all the time and that especially appealed to me.The dialogue used is rife with slang terms and it gives the film a sense of realism and you don't have to be American to relate to the story or characters it comes across as universal. The setting used is the stereotypical American high school and because of its authenticity the feel and look of it adds to the atmosphere, the graffiti covered lockers, the engraved tables, the mould encrusted toilets really make the film come alive. The negative aspect of the film which stood out was the inexperience of the 'so called' teen actors yet they radiated a sense of innocence (especially Claire played by Molly Ringwald) and that youthful spunk which was needed. The film is almost 20 years old and so therefore it comes over as quite dated yet the questions raised and to an extent answered still hold their own ground in today's world. I think that everyone can relate with one of the five teenagers due to their diverseness in character, appearance and value system. I thought that the character of John Bender played by newcomer Judd Nelson shined in this performance thanks to his quirky comebacks, raw emotion, and the fact that he's so damn cool. Yet all the characters are well rounded and each have their moments to shine, and shine they do. I have to say that The Breakfast Club is a great film and anyone who hasn't seen it should do. The genius that is the 80's legend John Hughes really knew what he was doing and made a little piece of heaven for all ages to enjoy. A timeless classic just hope you can get past the shocking clothes (especially Principal Vernon's Barry Manilow inspired wardrobe). I'm just a sucker for all those escapist 80's films and I just can't say no to them, pure magic.",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
