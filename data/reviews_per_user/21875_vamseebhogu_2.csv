Skyfall," All in All Bond is back
","Skyfall - a bond movie that explores the psyche of bond further, with a villain whom we can see as a definite nemesis to bond. Characters being introduced to the re booted franchise and the movie finishing in the confines of the offices of Universal Exports which viewers have almost forgotten as the front for most of bonds operations. More than a bond flick it is more about M. Her stewardship of MI 6, belief on her best man. M's past which keeps asking her to 'think on her sins' and the relationship between M and bond which has often been referred to as that of a parent and an erring child.Sticking to canon the movie does start with a chase which starts on foot gets a 4 wheel drive car followed by a bike chase on the roof tops of Istanbul's grand bazaar before culminating on a trains roof top but not before Bond gets shot and an obituary duly written. An un named villain comes out of the shadows with a vendetta against M. After an unsuccessful bid on bombing MI6 and compromising the identity of NATO agents when the going gets tough and M is faced with an inquiry enters a resurrected bond who is living a silent life on some island. Its here we see the not often seen human side of Bond. His rigors and tests to get back onto the field. After a face off with Mallory the chief of intelligence bond travels to Shanghai. After a stakeout, chase, fight sequence with an image of a beautiful yet deadly jellyfish acting as a silhouette to the action, a visit to a casino and an interesting conversation happens with the Bond girl of this movie which delves not just on bond getting the girl but also touching on fears and death. we see bonds (read M's nemesis) emerge and the movie takes a new momentum. In the ruins of an abandoned island bond faces Silva who has his vendetta against M and MI6. Bond using the gadgets given by Q branch summons the cavalry and apprehends the guy. Fans are used to cutting edge gadgetry in bond movies but here its just a simple radio that he uses. The scene then shifts to London where the past that is haunting M is revealed. Silva was an MI6 operative who went beyond his brief hacking the Chinese and M was forced to hand him over to the Chinese during the hand over of Hong Kong in return for 6 of her agents. Silva bears the imprisonment and after years of planning begins his revenge on M and MI6 which goes beyond the obvious. As M heads out to face the board of inquiry Silva escapes leading bond through the London's underground tube. Through rush hour traffic, surviving a bomb Bond with help from a young Q realizes silva's plan and reaches the inquiry venue. At the inquiry M speaks on the relevance of human intelligence. How technology is overshadowing our lives and how agents putting lives on the line no longer matters finishes by quoting Ullysses by Tennyson. Silva enters and tries to take out M. Bond intervenes at the nick of the moment and goes a step ahead of everyone and takes M with him saying 'we are going back in time, where we have the advantage' They reach skyfall the house where James bond was born and grew up not just from being a child but to the detached man that he is. There bond is left with just a few rounds in his walther ppk, a hunting rifle and a few sticks of dynamite. The wait for the arrival of Silva puts M and Bond into a conversation where he remarks that the obituary was appalling. The final showdown takes place hurting M fatally but bond manages to take silva out not with a gun or bullets but with a hunting knife. The movie speaks loads of the human and fallible side of this hero which shows him as a child who faced tragedy at an early age making him the man he is, the agent who improvises and stands firm on his determination to protect M and the never say die attitude that the character actually stood for before getting lost in the gadgets of Q branch and the dropping necklines of his various Bond girls. Daniel Craig looks jagged and fight worn but this perfectly fits the mood of the movie and shows Bond not just as the super spy but as the human that he is. If Casino Royale showed how bond was betrayed by Vesper this movie shows his more human side. The quotes from Tennyson do keep ringing after the movie and shows how things may change and hurt yet being unyielding Bond moves on. If this movie were to be a trilogy it has very clearly set the ground for further movies and re introduced bond to the present generation. The sad part was to see Judi Dench leave the franchise but guess it had to happen, the franchise however gets Money penny back into the story. To sum it up yes the Sky did fall onto bond in this story but our man did make it through.",10,2,7,7 March 2013
Man of Steel," Superman A Must Watch
","A problem a necessity leads to a solution or a re-invention. But what if a super human personality searches for answers? What if the choices for him were made and still he has to make a choice? Man of Steel is not just about the cape wearing super hero who can bite a bullet and x ray you. It's not about the super powers he has and how he uses them. It's about how a father defies the world he knows for giving his son the ability to choose. How Jor El even after his death provides an avenue to his Son Kal El to discover himself. How Jonathan Kent helps Clark Kent harness and control his powers and maintain a low profile in this world where his super powers may be perceived as alien and lead to his alienation. Man of steel is about Clark Kent's search for who he is? Where he comes from and how he has these incredible powers. It's about how Lois Lane picks up trails and tracks of Greenhorn a shrimp fisherman who mysteriously disappears after an accident on an oil rig, a bar tender who leaves the bar after being provoked by a drunk brawler but does not budge. How she discovers who this supernatural being is who seems to come out of nowhere to help people and silently disappears. As a story Arc Man of Steel has a villain who is equal to Super Man and wreaks havoc on earth searching for him as Super Man is the last son of Krypton and holds the key to the dead planets emergence again. General Zod searches out planets and arrives at earth understanding the key to his quest is on earth. He holds the earth at ransom and out comes Kal El/Clark Kent but now fondly called Superman by the people. Superman takes on General Zod in an epic battle which pits General Zod as an equal adversary whom Superman has to finally kill in battle. The story unfolds much better on screen with the effects and epic battles. But one question to all those whiners who complain about Superman killing General Zod? Why not look at this point in Superman's journey as the pivotal point where he decides as a principle not to kill anyone? For more on the action sequences they are better watched on screen. Henry Cavill looks every bit the Super character he is and also has that adoring and lovable smile which makes him the innocent looking Clark Kent. The photography is awesome in the movie and there are a few easter eggs to all DC Comic fans where Lex Luthor is referred and also Bruce Wayne(Batman's) Wayne Enterprises is mentioned.",9,1,5,1 August 2013
