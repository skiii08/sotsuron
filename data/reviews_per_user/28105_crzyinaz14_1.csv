Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," hey- give it a break
","Maybe it's just because I was young enough to be in the 'target audience' that you are speaking of when it came out, but I didn't find the movie that bad. Or maybe, it's just because I can remember the basic parts to a story that so many people are forgetting. You see, every story has this thing called an 'exposition', now you don't need me to explain that to you, who I hope to assume are fairly well educated adults. But just in case...Phantom Menace was not meant to do really anything other then set up the story. Its only purpose was to establish as many answers as it could to existing questions and become a backdrop to the following movies that would follow. It did not have the advantage of starting in the climax like the original Star Wars, therefore it could never have been so action-packed. What kind of epic story does not have some sort of boring introduction? Some of the best books i've ever read started out pretty slow. So give Phantom a break, you expected too much from Chapter 1. Instead of looking at the(I'll admit weak) dialogue and anti-climatic storyline, focus on the other things that make it a good piece of entertainment. The music was stunning, the visuals spectacular, and the acting (except for young Anakin...) was never dull. I don't know about you, but by the end of the movie, I could not wait to find out what happens in the next chapter; and that's all it was meant to do. If you haven't noticed, there are at least three important plot lines in Episode II, which could not fit into the movie if they still had to explain the beginning concepts and characters of the story. So don't give up on Lucas just yet, you have no idea what's in store.",Null,0,1,14 March 2002
