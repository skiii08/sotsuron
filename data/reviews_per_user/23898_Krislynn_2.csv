E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," it's okay
","After hearing about this movie for so long (yes, I am almost 19 and just finally decided to view it), I found it very disappointing, it was an okay movie, but I figured it would have been alot better, maybe if I would have watched it with lower expectations I could've enjoyed it more.",5,1,5,14 April 1999
The Waterboy," a 10 not a 6.4
","I can't believe this movie only got a 6.4, Adam Sandler is funny in everything he does, he can't go wrong. I give it a 10 anyways I was laughing the whole way through, and I'm still imitating some of the characters from the story, and it's still got me laughing. It has to be Sandler's best film yet.",10,0,2,13 April 1999
