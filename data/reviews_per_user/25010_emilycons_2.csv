It," This was a let down
","Honestly I'm someone who likes the occasional scare, but I scare easily. I wanted to watch this movie, hearing that it was a big hit, but unfortunately was let way down. The characters weren't likeable, the clown pennywise wasn't in the movie near enough, and I honestly thought this movie was funny, not scary in the slightest. I definitely wasn't expecting that because as I said before, I scare easily.",2,5,9,21 August 2018
Orphan," Great Horror Film!
","I'm not one for horror movies, like at all. I was nervous this movie would be super scary but I wanted to try it out anyway. This movie does a great job of being scary, but not so scary it's hard to watch. It was more intense and rather disturbing than it was scary and I loved it!",9,2,3,27 June 2018
