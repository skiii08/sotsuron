Sucker Punch," Works on some levels and fails on others
","Many people have asserted that this is a love it or hate it movie, but I disagree. I didn't really have very strong feelings about it either way, though certain aspects of it left me with vaguely positive or vaguely negative feelings.There are two ways to interpret this movie. The first is as a tale of female empowerment, with multiple layers of symbolism, amazing CG and breathtaking stunts. The other way is a series of pointless and gratuitous video game cutscenes with half naked girls, who have no personality or backstory. There's an element of truth to both interpretations, though I think the female empowerment is akin to the 1990s-era 'girl power' movement. This faux feminism says that girls can do whatever they want, as long as it titillates men and doesn't upset the social order. While some people may find empowerment in this, I find it a bit cynical and too watered down.Like Michael Bay, Tony Scott, and Ryuhei Kitamura, I think teenage boys who care more about style than substance are always going to be his main demographic. The frustrating thing is that I think he's capable of doing more.",5,0,1,25 July 2012
Mr. Nobody," Soundtrack with some images.
","I couldn't finish this movie, mostly because it didn't even seem like it was a movie. There were so few actual moments when pop music wasn't playing, I felt like I was watching MTV.I think it's telling that as the age progresses, the average IMDb vote decreases. There's no real substance at all to this movie. It's just a bunch of music videos stuck together.A good movie should be able to stand up on its own two feet without an hour's worth of pop music. I'm sick and tired of movies that are basically just an excuse to sell soundtracks, instead of the reverse. I don't know when this started happening, but it's a trend that really, really needs to die out. Soon.Ugh. I should have known better than to try watching a movie beloved by teens.",2,16,36,4 February 2011
Drive," Tarantino, Mann, and ostentatious 1980s references
","The plot: A getaway driver gets involved in the lives of his next door neighbors, when they run afoul of mobsters.I'm a big fan of Refn's Pusher trilogy, but this film failed to live to the enormous hype. I'm a fan of minimalism, art house films, exploitation films, and electronic music, but there was something that was just off about this movie. To some extent, I think it's because it was constantly reminding me of Michael Mann and Quentin Tarantino.It was moody, atmospheric, and just as violent and nihilistic as I was expecting, given that it's a Refn movie. No complaints there. I was also impressed with how much Refn accomplished, given the minimalist style. There's very little dialogue, and almost none of it comes from the protagonist. He seems to communicate almost entirely through nonverbal cues. However, the story just didn't really grab me. It's easier for me to get behind a minimalist story like Halloween (disturbed man tries to kill his sister), Assault on Precinct 13 (crooks siege a precinct), or The Thing (monster hunts down researchers), because they're properly minimalist. John Carpenter knows how to prune down a script to just the barest essentials until there's absolutely nothing left but the high concept pitch he used to sell it. When it comes to Drive, it seems like Refn wants to have his cake and eat it, too. It's got complex neo-noir elements mixed in with the minimalist style, and I'm left wondering why he didn't just commit one way or the other.Maybe with repeat viewings I'll come to appreciate it like all the raving fans. As it stands, I liked it, but I don't think it was the best movie of all time. I don't even think it was Refn's best movie. The Pusher trilogy is what made me a Refn fan, and it seems as though he might be moving away from that style (inspired by Dogme 95).",7,0,3,26 March 2013
2012," Despite myself, I still kind of enjoyed this movie.
","Yesterday, if you had told me that I would give this movie a rating higher than 3/10, I would have laughed. Today, however, after having finally watched it, I can say that pretty much all of my predictions were correct: the story is dumb, the dialogue is silly, the characters are annoying stereotypes, and the effects are stellar. However, despite how stupid this movie is, it never actually bored me. The cardinal sin of any form of entertainment is boring the viewer, and, honestly, I can't say that this movie bored me, despite how much some parts of it annoyed me.If you hate Roland Emmerich films, then don't watch this. Obviously. If you find them stupid but tolerable, then come on aboard the ark. It's no better than Universal Soldier, but it's no worse than Stargate. That should be good for a 5/10 or so.",5,1,3,23 December 2010
Unknown," Derivative movie that pushes suspension of disbelief
","Unknown is not a bad movie. However, the good parts are generally stolen from other movies, and it can be somewhat distracting to constantly be thinking to yourself, 'They stole this from Frantic' or 'They stole this from Total Recall'. Ostensibly a thriller, it veers from action to thriller to psychological thriller and back to action. With a skilled director, I think this could have been handled a bit better -- or entirely avoided. Thriller fans, who are expecting more realism than action fans, have less tolerance for over-the-top, unrealistic plot lines and stunts that characterize action movies. Also, with the classic 80s and 90s action stars starting to push 60, it's getting a bit more difficult to believe that they're fighting off assassins and seducing 30 year old women. Liam Neeson does a credible job, but I think a younger actor would have been better.If you're looking for an over-the-top action/thriller hybrid, you could do much worse. It's well-made and has a pretty good cast. I found this movie to push my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, while being derivative of several classic action and thriller movies. If these issues don't bother you, then I'd recommend Unknown.",6,0,0,5 August 2012
In Time," Overt socialist propaganda
","Usually, I prefer my movies to have a bit of subtlety to them. I dislike being hit over the head with overt, trite messages. Sometimes, when the rest of the movie is done well enough, I'm willing to overlook the lack of subtlety. Unfortunately, this movie isn't really done as well as I'd like, but it's still enjoyable for what it is.The concept, as many people have said, is quite good: in the future, a corrupt system is put in place, where genetically engineered humans stop aging at 25, yet have only one year to live after that. Everything they buy reduces their lifespan, so most people end up living desperate lives in a near-panic, constantly attempting to find enough work to survive another day. The wealthy and powerful, on the other hand, live for centuries, with no worries.The execution is a bit heavy-handed and clichéd. The plot is predictable, and most of the points raised are a bit simplistic. Of course, the antagonist is a mean, old, wealthy capitalist whose philosophy basically amounts to 'screw the poor', while the protagonist is an idealistic young man whose charisma and daring acts of valor threaten to topple an entrenched totalitarian system that's been stable for over a century.Still, I like Niccol's work, even if it does get a bit didactic and heavy-handed at times. If he can work on making his movies a bit more subtle, I think he's got a chance at becoming one of my favorite directors.",7,1,2,31 July 2012
The Woman in Black," Generic, clichéd, and gimmicky.
","The plot: A young man is drawn into the mystery of a haunted house and a hateful, vengeful ghost.The Woman in Black is a rather generic, clichéd, and gimmicky movie. Although the tension and atmosphere slowly ramp up to admirable levels, it's all for naught, as it ALWAYS results in some cheap and gimmicky jump scare. I can totally understand how this would work to startle you early in the movie, but, after an hour of constant jump scares, it just gets tedious. When the movie didn't depend on these jump scares, the scenes were generally effective at establishing a creepy mood, even though it resorted such overused, clichéd elements as old toys, rocking chairs rocking themselves, and silent, ghostly children.The plot was incredibly simplistic, and it was explained several times throughout the movie, in case you weren't paying attention the previous times. Everything is spoon-fed to the audience, with absolutely no attempt at subtlety. I wasn't really expecting anything else, though, as movies based on Gothic Romanticism are traditionally weighed down by tradition demanding that they include every single cliché imaginable.The acting was a bit of a mixed bag. Daniel Radcliffe was incredibly wooden, and he seemed to have only one facial expression (dull surprise) for the entire movie. Seeing as how he was playing a very depressed, repressed, and distressed individual, this may or may not be excusable, depending on whether you're a fan or not. The other actors were more animated and alive, though they didn't really have a whole lot to work with. Most frustrating, perhaps, was the token rationalist. Although he serves as friend, mentor, and sidekick, depending on the needs of the scene, his main purpose is to be proved wrong and admit that he was always in denial about his belief. This is incredibly lazy writing.I had high hopes for James Watkins, after seeing Eden Lake, but this is a movie for young Harry Potter fans, who will squeal with fright and then laugh nervously, after every cheap jump scare. If you're older than Daniel Radcliffe, I would suggest that you avoid this movie. I always thought that Jane Goldman was a hack and Daniel Radcliffe was wooden, and this movie does nothing but confirm my previous beliefs.",5,0,0,8 March 2013
X-Men: First Class," A breezy popcorn movie for kids.
","I'm perfectly willing to accept that certain characters and plot points must change when you adapt from one media to another, especially when you're talking about a two hour action movie aimed at kids. However, the liberties taken with the characters in this movie are simply too much for me to wrap my head around. Sebastian Shaw is a WWII Nazi war criminal? In the comics, he's an amoral, American businessman who joins a secret society, kills all the leaders, and usurps control. That's a pretty scary guy. Does he really have to become an over-the-top Josef Mengele stand-in? Charles Xavier and Mystique are now step-siblings? OK, I'm willing to accept Shaw as a Nazi war criminal if I must, but this is just bizarre. Most of the characters have their nationalities switched around for no apparent reason. Furthermore, their ages are all messed up, with Havok (Cyclops' younger brother) being particularly paradoxical, now that he's old enough to be his elder brother's father. Seriously, I can forgive a lot of stuff, but this is just sloppy beyond belief.OK, so the continuity is all messed up, the characters and their interactions are completely revamped, and this is apparently meant to be a reboot, not a prequel. How is the actual movie, once you get beyond the issues regarding the source material and continuity? Well, I'd like to say it gets substantially better, but there are several really annoying aspects to it. First of all, there's a token black guy who's introduced and then almost instantly killed off. Seriously? I can't believe that we're still doing that in 2011. Emma Frost, the White Queen, was never one of my favorite characters. I always felt that she was one of the worst examples of the objectification of women in comic books, and she's played completely straight in this movie. Her stripperific costumes are toned down quite a bit, however. The X-Men, after weathering an attack by Shaw and his associates, go through an intense week of training, where they each suddenly have individual epiphanies and become self-confident bad asses, getting beyond whatever psychological issue was holding them back. Ugh. It reminded me of a horrible 80s movie, but, luckily, we were spared the training montage set to Eye of the Tiger. However, what really annoyed me was the ease with which characters flip-flopped between good and evil. One simplistic speech is enough to change almost anyone's mind, it seems. Then again, this is a comic book movie for kids and young adults, so I guess you can't really expect anything deep. Action movies aren't generally known for their deeply philosophical dialogue and strongly written characters. The X-Men have never been intellectual, highbrow entertainment, but they were written better than this, and they deserve better than this.",5,6,10,8 September 2011
