The Ring," Look Under the Surface (After your done being freaked out)
","DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!!I just got done seeing the movie, so I'm still a little on edge, so please forgive any mistakes I might make.  I think this is an incredible movie, not only of the crazy freakyness of it, but for the amazing message right there inside it.  The reporter saves herself (and her son) by perpetuating the circle.  She lives by making someone else die, which in end of the movie, is all of us.  The boy's father's quote, something like, you media, you take one person's tragedy and force us all to live it; Think about it.  Look at all the use of TVs in the movie.  Now turn on your TV to one of the 24 hour newsstations.  You got a sniper in DC who's killing people for attention, the media covers it, he gets more attention, keeps on killing, perpetuating the circle.  The girl is evil and wants her message spread.  The reporter does this for her.  For me at least, this movie really makes you stop and think about some serious issues regaurding the media and where we are going. Well, we only got 7 days, but I'm sure the 24 hour news cycle will give us 168 straight hours of coverage of our demise.  Gore Verbinski better win some major awards, this guy is for real.  OK, my rant is over, i'm going to go be freaked out some more.",10,0,0,20 October 2002
