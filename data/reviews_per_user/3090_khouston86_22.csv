Alien 3," Proves that Fight Club is also terrible
","I didn't realize that Fincher directed this horrible, horrible movie. That figures, however.  Look, people, this is the same director who gave so many of you your shrine, Fight Club.  No director who could make this trash is capable of a masterpiece.  Fight Club isn't, and its adherents need to wake up.  As for this one, how dare he?",Null,1,3,23 January 2003
Training Day," Not exactly a mood lifter
","For some reason, the word I associate with this film is depression.  Lots of the writing and the acting is solid, but are we really this bad?  Do we really live among people who are like some of the characters in this film? Unfortunately, I think the answer is yes.  No, I don't think there are cops like Denzel.  (But I don't think there a hell of a lot of 'em like Elliot Ness, either, sad to say).    To me, this film tells us something about where we are as a society, and it doesn't speak too prettily.  Every man is a bad ass(yeah, right), latino gangstas from the hood have no respect for life, and in just a little way, the movie seems to want us to think these people are cool.  I ain't buying it, but I suspect lots of people are.   I guess I would compare this movie to Goodfellas and 'No Fear' stickers. It is partially in love with the idea of its own toughness and ruthlessness. It kind of makes me want to say, 'Oh, really? Wanna dance?'",Null,0,11,17 February 2003
Meet the Parents," very good
","The first time I saw this movie, I was in a bad mood and didn't like it. That goes to show how significant moods can be when seeing a movie.  This really is a smart, funny movie.  Maybe it needs to be seen twice.  Anyway, I was certainly wrong the first time I saw it.  Focker's plight does get a little frustrating, but that is called dramatic tension--'Three's Company' lived off the same kind of stuff for years.  It is done much better here.  I do think it stole from 1979's 'The In-Laws' with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, and I do think the earlier movie was better, but it's like an 8.5 or 9 versus a 10.",Null,0,0,3 December 2002
Unbreakable," thoroughly enjoyable, if not Shy's best
","When I saw this movie in the theater, a group of clowns sat in the back and tried to make fun of it, eventually walking out early.  They weren't missed, and I was tempted to do some breaking of my own. But getting past that, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  While it isn't as brilliant as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable held my attention, entertained me with its suspense and action, and provided some food for thought.  I call it a success just a notch below Stir of Echoes or Frequency. A 7.5.",Null,0,0,3 December 2002
Fight Club," sorry, it's no clockwork orange
","This, along with Amores Perros and The Green Mile, is one of the most overrated movies on this site. Merely utilizing the common modern technique of 'things not being what they seem' does not make a great movie.  Here, the technique is meaningless. And yes, our society is excessively consumer-driven and not passionate or honest enough.  But people were supposed to learn values that make them aware of that in grade school.  If they haven't learned this lesson by now in life, they aren't going to be smart enough to get it from an intentionally complex film.  On top of that, I am not even sure that Fincher is truly criticizing our domesticated society.  It seems that the rebels are the real problem in his film. I have seen people here compare this film to A Clockwork Orange.  That is like comparing Corey Maggette to Michael Jordan.  Or Mobsters to The Godfather.",Null,0,1,27 November 2002
Memento," very smart
","Very smart film, respects the viewer, holds your attention and rewards thinking.  Also emotionally engrossing, even if somewhat unpredictable.***Spoiler***Didn't make me feel good when it ended.  Kind of reminded me of a modernist poem--the futility of man's quest for meaning, etc.  But the following thought consoled me later: He discovered what was going on at the end, that Terry and others were using him to kill.  And then he took control of his fate by deciding who he would kill next.  He knew he was lying to himself when he wrote down Terry's license plate, but he also knew he wanted to kill Terry.  So he took control of his fate the best he could. ***End of spoiler***Should not be missed.  It is better than almost anything else out there.",Null,0,2,27 November 2002
The Natural," baseball's best, redford's best
","This strikes me as a very American movie.  The story of the man who lost his way and then found himself again.  Maybe that story is universal, but it seems uniquely American to me.  I am a huge baseball fan and reader, etc. This is my favorite baseball movie.  This seems to be the definitive role of Redford's mature career. I can't imagine anyone playing the role better.  He was in fact an excellent baseball player out of the west as a young man-scholarship to Univ. of Colorado.  He so perfectly represents all the potential of the game and the nation here.  Talented, attractive--he just looks like a hero.   Outstanding.  One for the ages.",10,0,1,27 November 2002
The Terminator," 'I crossed time for you, Sarah'
","O.k., that is kind of a cheesy opening, but my point is that this movie works as a love story almost as much as it does as an action movie.  It is an amazing movie, maybe one of the ten best I have ever seen.  It gets better with time.  Its few critics here, it seems, just want to blow up the eighties.  Good luck.  Instead, try making some memorable films today so that this isn't thought of as the empty period of popular movies.  For example, people are praising and praising Lord of the Rings The Two Towers and even the latest Star Wars, mainly because our expectations have slipped. Compare those two movies to Terminator. Granted, the evil, dog-like humanoid war creatures in The Two Towers are amazing and scary as hell, but that, along with a little suspense in the battle scenes, is about it.  As scary as the Two Towers creatures are, Terminator himself was equally scary, and there is just so much more in terms of character development and prolonged suspense.  As for the new Star Wars and its phony CGI effects, there is no reason to even compare it to Terminator.  My point is that popular, mainstream movies are a reflection of the time period.  Terminator reflects well on the eighties.  (Terminator II was good, but it is probably an 8 at most, somehwere around Two Towers' neighborhood, slightly below The Fellowship of the Ring, which at least had emotion and character development, slightly above the latest Star Wars.  Terminator is a ten).",Null,0,0,9 April 2003
Rocky II," rated way too low here
","This movie is not significantly inferior to the original, and both belong in the top 250.  It is the quintessential American film, the story of the underdog. Rocky II is merely the realization of Rocky's dream in the original.  They are really two parts of the same movie.  I would rate this film slightly below its predecessor, but not even a full rating point. Granted, Rocky III and V were bad, but Rocky II was great.  (Rocky IV was pretty good, too--probably a 7.5 to 8).",10,1,1,27 November 2002
American Beauty," Good, but Donnie Darko is far better
","This is a good movie.  It accurately presents adult feelings of wanting to feel alive and in love and loved and desired and younger.  But the movie is depressing for its own sake, and that doesn't elevate it to the status of high art.  You don't have to be boring and wear black and hang out constantly in coffee houses or love Fight Club to be deep.  The irony is that what Spacey's character is after is more joy, but I doubt many of American Beauty's (or Fight Club's) fans are joyful, truly passionate, courageously passionate people.  Those types of people will prefer Donnie Darko, and they will get to use their brains, as well as their hearts, so much more intensely watching that film.  Indeed, Mendes' follow-up effort, The Road to Perdition, deals adeptly and emotionally with fathers and sons and is probably a better movie than American Beauty.",Null,0,0,17 March 2003
Spider-Man," Too long, very little happens
","This movie is way too long--over 2 hours, and it seems very long--for its simple, uneventful plot.  I have read here that the movie deviates from the comic story in major ways.  Some of the things left out--the whole Gwen Stacey thing, for example--might have helped here.  Much of the final half of this movie just feels like empty space.      It is as if the pacing of the movie was determined by James Franco, who is unbelievably irritating and slow in his role here as Peter's best friend. (I realize that he is probably supposed to play a kind of loser, but he didn't have to be that dim-witted, I don't think.)         The teenage angst stuff at the beginning worked well.  But the movie was way too long, very little happened, Kirsten Dunst looked unattractive, the Goblin was boring, and the tone was sometimes too flighty.
****Possible Spoiler**** Because the tone is not sufficiently serious, and the characters are not well-developed (the whole prior dead lover guilt Gwen Stacey thing is left out) and because the movie wears out its welcome, Peter's declaration of non-love to Mary Jane at the end comes off as not only disappointing, but also as cruel, annoying and inexplicable. ***end of spoiler***",4,0,1,27 January 2003
The Fast and the Furious," pretty good, and not as dumb as you think
","It would be easy to dismiss this movie.  But the easy choice isn't always the right one, and it isn't here, either.  Yes, there are similarities to Point Break (a good movie).  But many good movies have borrowed from other movies (check out 1980's The In-Laws and compare it to Meet The Parents if you want to see major imitation).  Lots of the characters here--but not all--seem kind of stupid, but I don't think they were trying to present rocket scientist car racers.  I think the dialogue and acting and writing actually rings true, if you pay attention.  It is nice to have an action movie that at least allows you to pay attention without feeling ridiculous for having done so (contrary to XXX, where you know from frame 1 that thinking is not welcome).  The action scenes, while not plentiful enough, are also good.  Don't let the hoard steer you away from this movie because it is 'dumb'.  Their reviews read sort of like the pot calling the kettle black.",Null,0,1,20 March 2003
Good Will Hunting," one of the best ever
","Simply one of the best movies ever produced.  Incredibly moving, razor sharp, beautiful, strong, life-affirming. Great sound track, too.  Best career performance of Williams and probably every other actor in the cast. Incredible piece of work.  Will stand the test of time.",10,0,2,27 November 2002
Dumb and Dumber," 'I can get 80 miles a gallon on this hawk'
","Or was it 'hog?'  In any case, I had a great time watching this movie.  I saw it with my Dad and my brother, and I laughed so hard I felt like I was going to choke.  We all did.  You know, I wonder whether a sense of humor can be correlated to individual courage.  There are people who don't find this movie, or lots of funny stuff, funny. I wonder if they are living and acting and having a personal style that they don't really like, just to conform or please someone else.  I wonder if that sort of self-prison keeps them from finding much of anything spontaneously funny. There was a pony-tailed pseudo-intellectual type sitting behind us in the theater.  I heard him in the parking lot afterward, telling his friends that he just didn't see what was so funny or how anybody could laugh at Dumb and Dumber. Well, I laughed because the stuff was funny, and I wasn't busy trying to act or dress or sit some way that I thought someone wanted me to act or dress or sit.  Doing things my way allows me to laugh at a lot of things (and not laugh at a lot of things).  Maybe I won't have a heart attack, either, or miss great moments in life everyday.  I guess I won't be able to impress guys with pony tails and no sense of humor, but I can handle that.",9,0,2,17 March 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," cool movie, Clooney is actually tough
","This movie shows a tough, edgy side of George Clooney that I had not seen before.  I had usually found him boring.  Oh, and to digress briefly:  Is anyone else bothered by the hypocrisy of women (I guess it is women) voting guys like George Clooney or Richard Gere or Sean Connery the Sexiest Man Alive, when, in real life, these women would sooner drop dead than date a man with gray hair?  I bet most of the ones who call these guys the Sexiest Men Alive wouldn't even date these very guys.  Oh, yes, we are a land of substance and honesty and character.  Anyway, Clooney seemed boring and a push-over to me before, but in this movie, he kicks butt.  The whole movie kicks butt.  It is alot of fun, and one of the good efforts by Tarantino (there have been too many bad ones since Reservoir Dogs, True Romance, Pulp Fiction, etc.)",Null,5,6,11 February 2003
The Green Mile," saccharin
","I was disappointed by the false tone of this movie.  Its phoniness stands in stark contrast to the excellent Shawshank Redemption.I guess my feeling about the film is this:  sure, we can pretend that people talk and feel like this and while we're at it we can all put teddy bears in our cars, get fat talking on cell phones while driving around mindlessly and watch wrestling together in sports bars.  Or we could be honest, be grown-ups, be fully human, and acknowledge that this film is mainly false.  But maybe that's just me.  The second half of the film is better than the first, but it feels like the whole thing was made by people walking on egg shells.  Gag.",5,1,3,25 November 2002
Scream," It is pretentious to criticize this movie, one of the best horror films ever
","Having suffered through numerous boring, stupid, overrated horror movies in my life, I found this one to be refreshingly excellent.  Really, critics, with all the junk out there, isn't this movie a gift?  It is scary, smart, well-acted and well-done cinematically.  Scream III did suck.  I hope people are unmerciful in their criticism of that pile of junk.  But I think it is disingenuous to criticize Scream.  By the way, the Drew Barrymore scene at the beginning is one of the most frightening and memorable in the history of horror movies.",10,0,0,6 March 2003
Signs," Most Reviewers Apparently Made No Effort to Get It
","I haven't read all of the reviews here. (How could I?)  But the few I have read nearly all fail to grasp the complexity and hidden meaning in this movie.  Sure, I guess it is okay to do nothing more at a movie than sit back, drink coke, eat popcorn and veg out.  But do you think the director made his movie doing that?  Would you make a movie doing that?  Do you honestly think you can get this movie with that kind of mentality? 
****Spoiler****There were probably no aliens at all.  The whole thing was probably an elaborate hoax by the townspeople to restore the Father's faith. Think of the little girl's line, 'There's a monster in my room, can I have a glass of water?' When you thought a witch or monster was in your room when you were a kid, would you calmly say, 'can I have a glass of water?' ****End of Spoiler***I just don't know why people watch a film in such a way that they would have to watch it again to get anything out of it.  This ain't 'American Pie.'",Null,0,1,4 February 2003
X2: X-Men United," while out-numbered here, the naysayers are clearly right
","XMen 2 seemed to take for granted that people were content to go along for any ride it wanted to take.  As to hardcore fans, this assumption was probably right. As to the curious rest of us, it was a horrible miscalculation and an insult.  Slow, boring, uninspired, meaningless, and shallow.  I gladly walked out before the climax, after sitting through a pointless hour and a half.  If we are supposed to feel so sorry for mutants, develop their characters.  Give us a reason to like them.  Tell a story, at least.  Do not assume that we have seen the first movie or that we have read the comic book.  I am a man, and I played sports and read about sports when I was a kid.  I did not read silly, nerdy comic books.  That is why I can satisfy women.  This movie can't satisfy anyone with a brain and guts.",Null,0,0,24 May 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," cruise's best performance
","This is Tom Cruise's best performance in a serious film.  Cruise is good in everything, but I just wish he would take on Tom Hanks-like Oscar-type roles more often.  This was one time he did.  Powerful movie, kind of a more serious Forrest Gump, actually.  Both movies are great, but I suspect those that found Forrest Gump too silly would like this better.  The material is necessarily heavy in spots, but the story is inspiring and true.  It is nice to be reminded that no matter how bad our lives get, we can make them better if we work to defeat our demons and keep going.  This movie, among other things, reminds us of that.",9,0,2,27 November 2002
Goodfellas," Good, but glorifies violence
","This is a good movie, but I kind of know I am getting in bed with people I don't want to associate with in praising it.  There are those--many--who will just like the glorification of violence because they are shallow and they have created some kind of false bravado in place of real courage.  In other words, they are the kind of phonies who talk a big game and think they are pimps, but haven't an ounce of sexiness, character or true backbone.      Now that I have dissociated myself from this group who likes the film, I will say that Liotta delivers an outstanding performance, and that the movie is very well done.  But it's just a movie, and not a life-changing one.  (Neither is Fight Club, for many of the same reasons).  It definitely is not 'The Godfather,' but you need class to understand that.",Null,4,9,17 February 2003
The Godfather," The best movie of all time
","This is the best movie I have ever seen.  It literally transports you into another world the first time you see it.  With the slow panning shot in the dark room, it seems to intend to do just that.        Reading some of the negative reviews here, I am reminded of just how different people can be in this world.  I can't imagine giving this movie a negative review.  Incredibly intense and emotional, beautifully shot, dramatically delivered, rings completely true.  The best ensemble performance ever. The best performance of Brando's career. This is simply the perfect movie. I confess that I have never been able to sit through Citizen Caine, but do not let reviewers here confuse that movie with this one.  Watching this movie is pure joy.        For the unique effect of taking the viewer into another world, I can only think of a few movies anywhere near the same ballpark.  The African Queen comes to mind, Terminator maybe, North By Northwest perhaps, Casa Blanca, Pulp Fiction and Rocky are candidates, maybe Cast Away. (Even First Blood was pretty good at that, strangely enough.  The Outsiders, the book, but not the movie.) Hopefully you get the idea.  This is incredible film-making.     Oh, and by the way, the Godfather is much better than the likes of Goodfellas because it is so much more noble and heroic.",10,0,2,15 February 2003
