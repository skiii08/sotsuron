The Blair Witch Project," Breakthrough in film
","This was a breakthrough film. Very, very scary. Saw it on the big screen after eating a big dinner ... BIG MISTAKE ... vertigo! If you a fan of the 'wandering camera' go see Michelangelo Antonioni's 'Blow Up' - 'Zabriski Point' and 'The Passenger' also breakthrough films using the 'wandering camera'. (In one take you see Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider eating in a cafÃ© by a window. A camera inside films the sequence from a normal perspective - then from the street outside - then from the table looking at a passing car - then from the passing car to the table - then back to a normal profile. This just does not happen in Hollywood movies period!",10,1,3,18 June 2005
