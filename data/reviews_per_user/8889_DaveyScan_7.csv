Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Instead of has-been, George Lucas brings us something new and unexpected.
","Well, the more I think about it, the more I like it. After the first showing I was confused and tired. Too much, too fast of new Star Wars events had took place, and the only thing I was able to say was 'Damn Jar Jar, but Obi-Wan rocks!'. Ewan McGregor/Obi-Wan Kenobi had and has for me become the coolest Jedi in the Galaxy. Darth Maul was like an unexperienced Pitt-Bull with over-confidence. Qwi-Gon Jinn was allright but too straight and monk-like. Jake Lloyd was bad, but I believed it was Anakin I had seen so it didn't really matter; maybe he talked too much while flying that Naboo Starfighter. Jar Jar was the pain he was almost-meant to be, he had good goof and bad, really bad goof time. Amidala was the straight emotionless character while her Padme was ah-so gorgeous. The story was great, the pod race not as exciting as I had been expecting but nonetheless extremely cool, the settings (Tatooine, Naboo, Coruscant and Otoh Gunga) were of the greatest things fantasy could bring on a screen. The lightsaber fights were great, and the final duel was awesome. People were complaining the lack of force driven conversation, but if you think about it here are the reasons (I guess): Jedi were in abundance at that time, people knew what the force was and what Jedi could do, so unlike with Luke in Episode IV, the Jedis don't have to explain everything they do. THE ART AND MUSIC I sorely miss Ralph Macquarie squarry design, I think Doug Chiang design are a little round for Star Wars, but since they are in the movie, I can't really say that anymore :) The music was great, Dual of the Fate, ranks second, in Star Wars theme after The Imperial March, it just creates a great dual atmosphere. But overall, it's the less-good (don't wanna say worst) Star Wars soundtrack, it missed a bit of thrill at some places and continuity. RANKING AND RATING I rank this movie third after The Empire Strikes Back and A new hope and before Return of the Jedi. Like all other Star Wars film *****.

Fight Club," A direct hit on your perceptions.
","Never, in my entire pityfull life, have I seen a movie like that. This is an open kick in the ass to the 'oh so good' capitalism society. , but unlike the latter, this movie will not bore the life out of you.It might open your eyes on Society. It might wake you up and make you face huMAN nature. Do you want that to happen? No. Do you need that to happen? I say Yes. You must face it: Violence is in the human nature. Don't get me wrong, there is almost no free violence in that movie. They, the member of Fight Club, fight to feel alive--just some number in the drone chain of american(capitalism) society. While our narrator fights his biggest problem with modern life.The movie is narrated by the Edward Norton's character. (Best Actor oscar for him; he's already accepting it :) ) That character feels he is losing his life and there is something wrong with the world around him, so he can't sleep. One night, on a business plane trip he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler is exacly what the narrator is not. They click, then the fight club(s) begin(s). But Marla, is she a threat like Tyler says? GO FIND OUT! Because this is my interpretation of the movie, and in my humble opinion, you'll be seeing, if you dare, a very stylished film and THE best one yet this year. The movie tagets a male audience.It's an open call for revolution. Let Project Mayhem begins. 'You are not a special snowflake..'P.S. By the way, Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, but that's just a small detail, right?The Direction: Mtv-ish at it's best. David Fincher is a master! The Acting: Brad Pitt is great. Edward Norton is unbelievable. Helen Bonham Carter is good if not excellent. Meat Loaf surpasses himself. Heck, even Jared Leto (blondie) is great! (yeah he got like 2 mins screentime)I Give this movie a :    98% (10/10)",10,0,1,25 October 1999
Sleepy Hollow," what if Proyas had direct..
","This movie is not scary. This movie isn't all that exciting. But it's very clever and well directed. Tim Burton is one of the master of the eerie movies (Batman 1-2, Edward Scissor Hands), but not 'the' master (my vote for Alex Proyas). This movie is entertaining, but a bit miscast (Ricci) and lacks some twists. The style takes over the substance, two thumbs up to Ray Park for the headless horseman, --and it's very over-the-top. Johnny Depp is really good. The musical score is not memorable.I Give this movie a 67% (7/10).P.S. Hope someone can make a better movie in the same genre.. nice try. The color of the blood was annoyingly fake.",Null,0,0,24 November 1999
American Psycho," A great mind-trip movie..
","(This review might contain a thing called spoiler. Beware)Christian Bale brings Patrick Bateman with `panache`. He is Patrick Bateman, very reasonable man, who never forget to do anything, is a rich yuppie in the 80ies, has no bad habit except one: he is one sick serial killer.The direction and the photography of the movie is perfect, the dialog is good (hilarious when Bateman speaks on music), the murders are chilling (running naked with a strange smile and a chain saw in his hands) and the suspense is quasi-hitchcockian.. There is a great plot twist at the end, which explain why this man really is American psycho. The great mass-killing ending is flawlessly delivered. The movie is not for the weak of heart. It 's (in my opinion) a stab at the 80ies over-consummation society.I give this movie a (high) 84% (8/10).P.S.: The dialog in this movie is really great, but the best line is right at the beginning when he says something about him not being there.",8,0,0,31 May 2000
U-571," Good war movie, not engaging enough
","The photography of this movie was good if not great, a good exemple is when the soldiers are on the ennemy sub and the other sub explodes..The cast was nothing impressive, as usual McCoughney was not engaging enough. Tim Roth had a role, and he is truly a great actor.The action and plot wore thin at the end, you are constantly on a sub when bomb-barrel are thrown at it. And you feel like no one important is going to die. The plot could have been better.I Give this movie 69% (7/10).P.S.: Suggestion to hollywood, try to focus one someone whole experience at the war and make it epic, sort of like Braveheart.. now that be nice in WW1 or WW2..",Null,0,1,31 May 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Cheesy James Bond Rip-Off... Indeed very cheesy.
","Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to suffer this movie. It's not mission hard, it's mission impossible.The plot is stupid, in hockey we use the expression, leaving the puck behind, in this movie they left the plot behind after the first 20 minutes. The action sequence are good, until the 20 minutes long look-at-me-killing-everyone-on-my-bike where John Woo show off why he sucks, and Tom Cruise ego is the only thing quite unmatchable. It's cool, then it's enough, then it's too much, then it's lame, then it gets very bad, then (spoiler) Ethan Hunt kicks his gun out of the sand to kill someone pointing a gun-- on his back!??! Good ol'e cheesy 80ies style. Two words: Way off. The directing is clever, but sometimes it seemed forever before the editing would cut a scene. And what about the slow-motion every 10 minutes, it's over-used. Woo should stay in Hong-Kong if he is proud of this movie. It's not even as good as Broken Arrow. The only thing this movie has is its truly cool villain. He is young, lethal and has fire in his eyes. Scott is the only cool guy in the movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins makes a cameo.I give this movie a 25% (3/10) (Stick with the original)P.S. Mission Impossible is about a team doing something without attracting any attention. Now this was the exact opposite.",3,0,0,29 May 2000
Gladiator," Smells like epic spirit..
","(My review might contain spoiler) Gladiator wants so hard to be epic that it is beyond our common wannabees. (ie: The Matrix). The closest experience to watching Gladiator is watching a porno. The sub-plots are so lame and you are so let down by the lame, lame, lame, lame (why did I pay to get depress kind of) ending that you are always waiting for the 'action' to begin. When you want to do a tragedy make it work, make us care about the main character.. Maximus was just too good, and Commodus was just too bad. You have to blur the good and the bad so we care about our good (slightly bad) hero. And how about that sub-plot of love (or was it?) between Maximus and the Emperor sister, it should have been developed.. and he should have escaped Rome and bring back the army too late to save his new lover.. QUIT IT ALREADY WHERE ROMEO ALWAYS HAS TO DIE. Juliette can die too, it would be less predictable sometime.. or even better they both live to see the next day.. no need for sweet thereafters. The main character had his share of tragedies, no need to make it a Voltaire rip-off.War, I assume is some sort of hell, but your head is not shaking live a damn arkinson sick patient. Even the glorious fights and armies cannot make me forget that it's all a big hoax, half the military unit seen in the movie did not exist at the depicted time.. I am sorry, but I'd like to believe that when millions are spent on a movie, and with the constant rising of ticket price, the writers are spending some time to make sure of some chronoligical accuracy.I give this movie 47% (5/10)P.S. Was the emperor sister pretty or what?",Null,0,0,29 May 2000
