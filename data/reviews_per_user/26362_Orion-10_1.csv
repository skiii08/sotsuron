Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a fun movie with sights to behold, but...
","4 out of 5 stars.I was one of those kids who saw the original Star Wars in theaters during the hot summer of 77 and then saw both it's sequels as well. Lucas's Star Wars movies have always had a certain charm and look to them that no other movies in Hollywood history have. Obviously, I was excited to see the new one and when the lights dimmed and the 20th century Fox logo beamed on to the screen, My heart started beating and I admit it, I felt like crying. The kid in me came out and it felt good. As the movie went on, I just got more excited and thrilled by what I was gonna see next. The podrace made my hair stand up on end. It was fun. The sights to behold in this movie are very brash and daring. One thing you can say about this movie is that it has to be one of the most epic looking movies ever. From planet to planet. You see three lush worlds and all there splendor. The feeling this movie gives off is pleasant. I felt like I wanted to walk into every scene. A few scenes here and there did give off a bit of digital vibe, but hopefully over time, The aging of the film print will make the effects look more settled in. The music of course, From John Williams is top notch.After I left the theater, I felt like I had been taken on the most fantastic ride in movie history. I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's amazing, The best movie in the history of mankind! Well, needless to say, I got carried away and let the overwhelming excitement of seeing a new Star Wars movie after 16 years, Get to me. After the dust settled. On my third viewing. I saw with clearer eyes. Now, I have to be honest folks. The acting in this movie is wooden. Except for Obi won, (Ewan McGregor), Who seemed to play his part right on target. Natalie Portman, Oh beautiful, sweet Natalie.(Queen Amidala), I wanted to love every line she said, but I couldn't. She did have a few good lines though that I thought were well delivered. (Jake Lloyd),  Anakin came off like a boy who dropped in on the Star Wars film set and was amazed to be there. Probably, because he was. His lines were all forced. Except when he says good-bye to his Mom, He pulled that off. Anakin, In this film comes off as shallow and kind ofmean. He feels like a showoff, but I guess it works. It is the future Darth Vader after all. Qui-Gon(Liam Neeson)looks great on screen, but he doesn't say one memorable line.I can't stress it enough, The performances were very wooden. Now, if you were around in 77 and saw Star Wars. Believe it or not you got that feeling from a lot of the actors in that movie as well. They were virtual unknowns. It's just that seeing those effects and that universe at that time was something fresh and knew. So we forgave them. Over the years you see the movie so much on TV and on tape. That you get used to the dialogue. That could happen with Episode 1. Who knows. Jar Jar binks, I didn't hate this guy for some reason. He didn't come off as annoying at all, but he did come off as kinda like, Who cares. I think people found him an easy target and used him as a good excuse to use in order to hate the film. His acting was cheesy indeed, but you have to also remember that this is Star Wars and it's not supposed to be Hamlet. It's all in fun. You have to keep the kids in mind too. My biggest complaint about Episode 1, is Anakin destroying the control ship. How many times can a pilot go into a ship or space station and destroy it from the inside out in a Star Wars movie? I thought that was unimaginative on Lucas's part.Episode 1 is the toughest of the three new episodes to make. It's the one that's most disconnected from the original three. Times were different in Episode 1. The universe was more spoiled and rich and times were grand. It look like Dinotopia, but my point is that people wanted it to feel and look like the original Star Wars movies. Stormtroopers, Xwings, but that wasn't there. The next episodes should start to slowly show how the empire takes over and times become darker. Rebels are forced to make ships from scrap and rebellions are formed.  Episode 1 is what it is. Accept it. Over time it will take it's place in Star Wars history. Backlash or no backlash. It's part of one big long 14 hour movie with 6 episodes. We know how it ends, but getting there is half the fun.",Null,0,0,29 March 2000
