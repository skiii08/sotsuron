Conquest 1453," Really worth to watch.
",I think this movie is really big step for Turkish cinema because this movie made Turkish cinema to move from bad quality movies to the another step and really created big blockbuster and very close movie to Hollywood for the first time.As a historical movie we already know what gone happen but important think here is how they show it to the audiences.This movie does this very well and shows conquest of Constantinepol very well.Actor and actress are not that great.Specially when we look to the main characters like Mehmet and Ulubatli Hasan you expect better performances but these actors didn't took their role very well.Some of the facts in the movie is showed wrong or didn't really cared but we can pass this because it is movie not documentary and can show something wrong just by mistake or to make people more happy.Of course this is reason of the show Turkish side better to make audiences more happier.Music is poor specially when Ottomans go the war you expect their band but so far from that plus you don't even have quality musics of Ottomans in the movie.Scenario is well made and lots of thinks showed correct and processed well in the movie.Animations are revolution for Turkish cinema and very big step in this subject.In conclusion movie is very very important for our cinema and for this reason this poor ways can be pass and i can say in this subject i mean historical movie best Turkish movie.All the Turks must watch this movie and see very big improvement step also proud with improvement and subject of this movie.This movie not great maybe for all the world even maybe for budget under quality which people expect but mistakes can be not seen because this movie made cinema to move forward.,7,7,19,2 September 2012
