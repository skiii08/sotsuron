Marie Antoinette," A fairytale
","It was almost like reading a picture book with very few words. Vibrant costumes and elaborate hair styles and little dialog made this movie very well put together. There was only a few inaccuracies-- her denial over saying 'Let them eat cake', an affair never historically proved, and Louis's weight'- but otherwise that such a good watch. I was truly proud of Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of an awkward, uncomfortable and not wanting to be married Prince and Kristen Dunst's portrayal of an eager (in the beginning she hugs everyone), not so intelligent, Queen of France. I thought she did a get job getting up in the morning to being dressed by all her ladies in waiting. I really liked it and would recommend it, not only for its beautiful pictures but its amazing soundtrack.",8,2,5,22 October 2006
Romeo + Juliet," Yey for Romeo + Juliet!!
","This was a great movie. Id GUESS I could have voted it as like a 9, but it was so good. Leonardo Dicaprio knew what he was doing and that made the movie twice as good. I love how they talked in 'old' English, or Shakespearan English. Superb. I loved how the people were played, and although Mercutio and Tybult were played disappointingly, they still scraped by. I thought they should have had a different Mercutio, and had Tybult act a bit differently. He acted decently, BUT he was weird and had weird teeth and didn't look Tybult-y enough, And thats speaking as a Shakespearan fan. Annnnd this is not long enough and IMDb is not letting me submit it, so blah blah blah and but I think maybe Reese Witherspoon should have played Juliet. Claire Danes did a good job but I think Witherspoon (with a brown-haired wig, of course) would have done nicely, too.",10,4,9,5 February 2005
She's the Man," Shes pretty good
","The movie starts out not so promising. It splays across the screen as the titles roll up and is slightly headache inspiring. However, the movie goes on and Amanda Bynes is about to prove, once again, her acting ability is on the ball. Never a popstar-y actress like Hilary Duff and Lindsy Lohan (Oh, thank you God) she has always been able to pull through and make the movie funnier. It was slightly predictable. I mean, its a girl pretending to be her brother in a all male setting, how predictable can you except it to be? However, its a funny spin on the entire thing. But its a good kind of predictable. Go see it. Its worth it.",8,1,3,24 March 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Funny, well written, and great acting!
","I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, produced in good taste, and had just the amount of action needed for a movie like this. Brad Pitt, who portrays a man's man, type of character does a great job as John Smith, and Angelina Jolie, who plays a suburban housewife type character also does a excellent job for Jane Smith. The chemistry between the two of them in great and they work with each other with ease and professionalism that is not seen in many movies lately. I was a little surprised, however that it got a PG-13 rating. Some of the language that was used was adult, but otherwise that I have no problems. It was enjoyable, a nice laugh, and a way to relax after the movies that have been coming out recently.",10,1,9,11 June 2005
