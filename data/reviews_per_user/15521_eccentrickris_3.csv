Ford v Ferrari," Whether you are a racing fan or not, you should go see this film
","I'm not much of a car fanatic let alone racing fanatic but the story had me intrigued enough to go see it and I was not disappointed!Ford v Ferrari tells the story of how Ford made it's first racing car with an aim to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans in France over Ferrari who had won the last four years. At its core however it is the story American car designer Carroll Shelby and British driver Ken Miles who made it happen and their relationship.Let's start first at where credit is due - with Christian Bale. Another terrific performance and he pretty much steals the show in his portrayal of Ken Miles. Tough to do staring alongside Matt Damon who also delivers a fantastic performance. Yet each role he takes on, Bale seems to be able to do no wrong.I also really enjoyed the scenes in the car during races and practice runs. The shots included during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of the track seen both within the car and also of the race, were really impressive. It gave a real authenticity to what it must feel like being in one of those races, similar to how Ride Like a Girl did the same for horse racing.The film isn't a 100% reflection on actual events, as there is more to this story which I have since been learning about. DO NOT let you stop you from seeing this film! I guarantee you'll get something out of it. It might even peak your curiosity as it did mine.",7,1,1,15 January 2020
1917," A simple story enhanced by the visual technique
","What I liked the most about this film is the way it is shot. The cinematography and direction of this film is outstanding, it truly is a visual stunner. The decision to film this as a 'one continuous shot' look was a brave decision and I'm sure many on the project had their doubts and possibly protests. I'm glad they pursued with it as it really pays off.The film follows two young soldiers, in a fairly simple plot - to deliver a message to call off an attack crossing through enemy lines. Although there are a many of special effects (you may have seen a plane crash in the trailer) the decision to tell the story using a continuous shot really adds to the trials and tribulations our protagonists face and makes this a more emotionally charged film.The film is always moving forward and there are many usages of camera angles which give more of a 360 degree view of what the soldiers are navigating and experiencing, rather than just seeing things through their eyes in a straight line. It was a really engaging technique and I liked the way we never traveled backwards as an audience except for one key instance which you will need to go see the film to understand.While I haven't seen all the films represented under the best cinematography category at the oscars, surely 1917 must win!",9,0,2,23 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Well balanced - it will have you laughing and pull at your heart strings
","Jojo Rabbit is about a young German boy (Jojo) in the Hitler Youth that finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their house. This proves problematic for young Jojo who not only is an enthusiastic nazi but whose imaginary friend is Hitler...played by Taika Waititi.From the outset this film looked like it was going to hilarious but how would it go in striking that balance of not being offensive?I found that the film was quite well balanced with the right level of seriousness and humor. I was laughing at the often ridiculousness of images through most of the film until I got to that point in the film where I felt like I'd been slapped in the face when things took it's inevitable serious turn.That said Waititi doesn't have you in slumped in sadness for too long. That's not the point of this film but it did need it. There is hope and there are surprises from terrible situations.In terms of the cast, the whole ensemble was very complementary to each other and not a performance let the film down. A couple of standouts (while hard to narrow down) would be Sam Rockwell - he again gives another brilliant performance and Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo was also very impressive.Taika Waititi himself did a great job in what is a difficult role to take on and made me think of Mel Brooks' The Producers several times.Highly recommend.",8,1,2,17 January 2020
