Requiem for a Dream," I hae an alternate title...
","*Spoilers, so stop reading now* *No, I mean it, there is a major spoiler coming, so don't get mad at me if you keep reading* How about 'A Farewell to Arm?' Har har har yuk yuk. OK bad joke. But come on, I would have enjoyed at least ONE light moment during this depressing work of art. Movies were originally, (and for the most part, still are) intended to give the audience a couple hours of entertaining relief from reality. Not so here, you are forced to sit through four gritty, ugly and depressing stories. You paid $8 for light-hearted escapism? Sucker! You get the reality you hate hearing about in the news thrown right in your face. This movie was never intended for the mainstream audience. So sorry dear reader, no John Williams score to lift your soul, no Julia Roberts enchanting the viewer, no Bruce Willis shooting the bad guys from the hip while making witty remarks, and most of all NO humor and NO happy ending.Shown over the course of three seasons, it starts off in summer, things are generally looking up, but it is already the peak of the roller coaster. Whoa, just like the one shown at Coney Island! *that's deep* It doesn't take long for things to go downhill, and at an ever increasing rate. Finally, the climax shows all hell breaking loose, with quick cutting clips from one story to the next. Faster and faster we go but not as fast as a MTV video. The major characters are all wonderful, especially Burstyn. And major shocker here, who knew that a Wayan's brother would choose to be a in GOOD film, and not suck in it?Great film, but put away any sharp objects when you watch.",10,0,0,13 August 2001
Erin Brockovich," entertaining but...
","Well, who wouldn't want to watch a movie about an extraordinary life such as Erin Brokovich? True story it may be, but it still feels like standard Hollywood formula. Although the formula still seems to work. Roberts and Finney are great, as is the story. It provides a good but not preachy moral: Work hard for what you believe in and you'll get rewarded. Well, in the movies anyway! Bottom line, it's a good movie. See it, enjoy it and feel good for seeing it. But don't expect much more than that.",8,0,0,24 April 2000
Ocean's Twelve," Julia Roberts pretending to be Julia Roberts
","From the onset, I knew the writing was a hack. Come on, a mysterious thief called 'the night fox'? what is this, some comic book? Apparently it is. The Thomas Crowne affair has already been done guys, oh yeah and that was made into a silly and pointless remake too wasn't it? And oh, let's not forget the imaginative and brilliant idea to write a scene where Julia Robert's character pretends to be Julia Roberts. I guess the intention was for it to be some kind of funny,inside joke where the audience was left out.This movie plodded and meandered along, I was just waiting for it end. I could care less about zeta-jones' character, or her relationship with Brad Pitt's character. There was a staggering number of flashbacks, just a poor editing job in general. It was as if the editors were trying for a Memento or pulp Fiction kind of story line, and failed miserably. Not even in the same league as the original.",6,0,0,6 June 2005
Notting Hill," Incredibly beautiful Roberts is a distraction
","Let's face it. Julia is naturally stunning. Yet I am sure the producers took extra effort to make her look goddess-like in every single frame and camera angle. The lighting is always optimal on her, her outfits are flattering and perfect. Makeup, hairstyle, yaddah yaddah yaddah. Well, I found it distracting to the story. Was all this lookism so absolutely crucial to the film? It seems like the film depends on Roberts looking like Helen of Troy to make the viewer care about her and Grant's character.It was a funny film though, Thacker's flatmate Spike, is wonderful comic relief, in an otherwise predictable film. Yes, I said predictable. *SPOILER* (not really though) Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl. As if there was any doubt. The lesson? Don't ignore true love. Ho-hum. I would have preferred it that Thacker goes with his decision to not stay with the movie star, that their lives are just too different, rather than drive willy-nilly all over town to get her back. Again, how many times have we seen that before? I will say that Robert's and Grant's chemistry is great. But before you believe all the hype about this film, just remember that it is a painfully formula romantic-comedy, albeit an above average one.",8,0,0,18 April 2000
American Psycho," Watered down version of the book
","For those who didn't read the book, the film is a shocking and disturbing film. After reading the book, I was hesitant in seeing the movie, because I knew it would probably be  disappointing and tame in comparison. I was right, although I was relieved that most of the violence is implied, rather than explicit. The torture/murder scenes in the book are sickeningly violent and cruel. Had Quentin Tarantino directed this one, he would have held nothing back, and the movie as whole would be better. The movie comes across as flat, truncated, and very watered down. Christian Bale is great however, a flawless performance as a corporate yuppie without a single human emotion. Read the book, it's got far more shock value and controversy than the movie could ever hope to offer.",7,0,0,13 September 2000
Driven," yuck
","Days of thunder was cheesy enough, but still more enjoyable and plausible than this piece of junk. Ugh. I want my $3.80 back from the video store. I especially loved the 'deep advice' Stallone gave after racing through the streets of Chicago. Wonderful scripting and dialogue, really. The actresses were there soley as eye candy, as they can't act for beans.",4,0,1,22 October 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Some original music would be nice.
","I guess Baz Luhrmann assumes that the majority of movie-goers won't appreciate a revival of the cinematic musical unless it is filled to the gills with melodies and lyrics that we are already familiar with. Original compositions are a good thing! Really, they are! Practically every other film has more original music on the soundtrack than this movie. It's also history mangling, how am I supposed to suspend my disbelief that this is Paris in 1899, when I keep hearing music from the 70's and 80's? Don't get me wrong, the arrangements were written and performed faithful to the spirit of the Broadway musical. At least they got that part right. Well maybe I shouldn't take the whole thing too seriously, but I WAS hoping for a somewhat more original story too. *spoiler* Ok so Nicole starts coughing up blood, gee what's going to happen at the end? Two people from different classes fall in love but it is ultimately doomed? *yawn* A writer changes the play to reflect his own affairs...gosh that's never happened before. Is it all bad? No, it's beautifully  filmed, with rich, exquisite colors. I laughed a few times, especially when the duke stomps on the frog in an effort to impress Satine. Leguizamo is also an unexpected treat. Unless you are a fan of the musical, don't bother with this one. If you ARE a fan, then you probably have already seen it. If not, just be prepared that you might be disappointed.",7,0,0,8 August 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," It's all been said
","Everybody else here has said it already. I saw this for the first time during 'freshman orientation' at the Berklee College of Music! Now if that doesn't say it all about this movie, nothing will. I could not believe how funny it was! This, right next to 'Holy grail' has so many memorable quotes and scenes. My only gripe that it wasn't long enough! The songs are quite funny, and 'Hell Hole' could actually pass for a real 80's hit! I find it hysterical when people don't get the joke and say 'That band was the worst, it was terrible!' Would you believe that when Steven Tyler saw it the first time, he didn't get it either. this movie is a total rip on the glam bands that were forming during the late 70's early 80's, most particularly Kiss. It also pounds on the Led Zeppelin docu-concert 'The Song Remains the Same' with Nigel's guitar/violin solo. Any current 'Back Street Boys', 'limp Bizkit', or 'Korn' fans that take the music a bit too seriously would do well to watch this film.",9,0,1,4 October 1999
The Green Mile," Fantastic, yet slightly flawed
","The quest to produce the greatest movie ever has eluded filmakers for decades. Many will say that nothing can topple Citizen Kane as the standard to compare to. Indeed, such a remarkable movie is not so easily forgotten. But how do we define a great movie? Great actors? Talented directors or Authors? A ridiculous Hollywood budget? These all help, yet the defining element of a truly great movie is how it moves you. The Green Mile moves the masses because it addresses one thing every living being has in common: death, as well as our fear of death. The film is filmed in exquisite detail that is accurate, but understated. Tom Hank plays a subtle character, allowing the other characters to breath and develop. As well, James Cromwell and Gary Sinise do remarkably well with their minor characters. The real prize goes to Michael Duncan, playing the condemmend (and enormous) John Coffey. The movie is without a doubt emotional, there is an execution scene that will forever haunt me. The humor is well placed to relieve the audience from the overall sad theme. Yet the tear-jerking scenes near the end are milked. It seems director Frank Darabont was going for the 'Kleenex effect'. That's all well and good, but Tom Hank's Forrest Gump in his 5-minute grave soliliquy to Jenny was more effective more than the 20 minute 'walkin' the mile' near the end. The 3 hour commitment for this film is not effortless, but order the small, 16 oz. $2.75 soda and find a theatre with those nice reclining seats, and you'll do well.",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
