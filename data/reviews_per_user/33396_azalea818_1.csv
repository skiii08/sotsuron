The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," loved it...
",I read all these reviews and I don't get it. Whats not to like its like the story with a few minor details left out. I mean if your expecting to see the titanic its not going to happen. Its a teenage romance really and if your not much of a romantic and like to poke fun at that kind of stuff you won't like this. However that being said I loved it. It wasn't over done in my opinion and they kept it as close to the novel as possible. I was only sad that the opening scene didn't have that amazing car like in the book lol. I thought the dialoge was really entertaining. Everyone in the theater was laughing and even clapped at the end. If you love the books you should watch it. Even if you don't and like movies like lost boys you'll really like it. Don't go in expecting to see The Kings Speech lol.... Well any ways it was good and i hope you all enjoy..,10,4,13,20 November 2011
