Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A good movie filled with great action sequence
","Saw the movie earlier today, and must say I really liked it. Having read the book, I wasn't sure how the movie is going to play out. I was really surprised by how much I liked it. Now If you are going to go see a good action movie then this will be a good choice. This is a work of fiction which uses one of the greatest president of United states as the main character and some of the historical events that happened during his lifetime. The acting was very well done, esp the characters played by Benjamin walker and Dominic copper were very well done. I personally think the whole cast did their jobs very well. Action sequences were fun and well directed. Timur the director did a great job in making this movie( really liked his work in Wanted and night watch) . The story was changed ago some extent from how is it in the book, and maybe would have liked to see some other parts of the book that were not part of the movie, but overall had a great time watching this movie. and will go see it again. And again this is my personal opinion, if you don't agree with it that's your choice and opinion.",9,5,10,22 June 2012
