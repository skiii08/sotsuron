Resident Evil: Afterlife," Very good in 3d, Not nearly as good in non 3d
","This movie gets a high review in 3d but not nearly as high in non 3d. I read several of the reviews and believe these viewers saw this movie in non 3d. I have seen it in both formats. The 3d version was awesome. They really utilized 3d technology. Unfortunately, when you watch the non 3d version it does not seem to be nearly as entertaining. It is an action packed film as are the other Resident Evil movies. (The 1st Resident Evil is still the best) There were some worthless characters in this movie such as the basketball player. I can't recall his name. Unfortunately, they are bringing his character back in the next film which is a mistake. Chris Redfield was slightly disappointing. The actor didn't match the video game character. Clare and Alice were both great as usual. The fight scene between the character with the axe in the prison was amazing in 3d however once again in the non 3d version it did not carry over well at all. It was not nearly as entertaining. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone in 3d for those that have the capability.",9,10,18,31 March 2012
Drive," Don't understand the '8.0' overall rating
","I rarely leave a bad review but in this case felt obligated due to the '8.0' overall rating. This movie was terrible. The previews were extremely misleading. It was a boring and slow movie. I wouldn't advise spending money to rent. If it happens to be on a movie channel maybe give it a try and see if it is your cup of tea. Zero action and amateurish acting. I think the majority of reviews were probably from young females that found the main actor attractive. Otherwise, I don't understand the good reviews. There are plenty of other good movies to rent at this time. There are several on http://www.imdb.com/list/20xZlMOTMEI/. Not sure why 'Drive' is on this list but there are a couple others that probably shouldn't be either.",1,7,15,31 March 2012
