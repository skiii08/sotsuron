It," Pale imitation of the book
","The book has a great paragraph;'Maybe, he thought, there aren't any such things as good or bad friends - maybe there are just friends, people who stand by you when you're hurt and who help you feel not so lonely. Maybe they're always worth being scared for, and hoping for, and living for. No good friends. No bad friends. Only people you want, need to be with; people who build their houses in your heart.'So many scenes missing, so many great moments missing, but most importantly the love between the kids just wasn't there.It's a beautiful book, don't bother with the film and put the time you would have spent watching it into reading it.",2,0,1,16 November 2019
The Maze Runner," Predictable
","If I had just one word to sum this up I would say predictable - but I have 10 lines to complete so I'll try and stretch that out a little.The plot is fairly straight forward, once a month a new adolescent boy gets delivered to a glade surrounded by very high concrete walls that form a maze. The maze opens every day and 'runners' go in to the maze. They must return by nightfall when the maze closes - nobody who has spent the night in the maze has ever returned on account of the 'grievers' (wooooooohhhhh!). None of the boys knows why they are there or have any previous memories other than their name which they remember after a couple of days. And then Thomas arrives.......The next hour and a half follow the exploits of Thomas and the boys who choose to band with him in their efforts to escape the maze. As you would expect things happen to Thomas with accelerated timing, there are dissenters among the other boys. Things happen (ie Ben attacking Thomas) just in an effort it seems that some other boys can explain things that happen where they are. The dissenters gang up on Thomas because he challenges the status quo, some people die some in heroic ways, there's a last minute attempt by leader of the dissenters to kill Thomas. A character dies, the boys move on to the sequel. And now you're up to date.I mean, it was OK, effects were quite good, plot was a bit weak, I appreciated not having to think too much for the duration of the film, and life goes on...........",5,1,3,15 August 2015
Arrival," Marmite
","Such a hard film to review, just browsing the other reviews you'll get a sense that people either love this film rating it 10, or hate it rating it 1.I watched the film with no idea of the context, background, or previous reviews. I was looking for a good Sci Fi film and this one popped up.I think it fair to say that if you're looking for a Star Trek, Starship Troopers, Aliens or other classic Sci Fi film then you'll be disappointed. There is virtually no action in the film, predicated as it is on one persons attempt to communicate with a new alien race. The film could equally have been based on a linguist communicating with ghosts or people beyond the grave, it wouldn't have made a great deal of difference.Many of the other reviews talk of large plot holes, ridiculous circumstances, or complete absurdity and it's hard to argue with that.And yet. And yet in it's way, despite everything, it's a beautiful thought provoking film in the way it deals with time, life, death, emotions, human response and so much more. The film is nearly two hours long, and the pace is slow, but I wasn't bored. I didn't feel that it was dragging, and I wasn't tempted even for a second to give up or fast forward.In summary, if you're looking for a Sci Fi film then probably avoid. If you're looking for two hours of pure emotion and self inspection then without question watch this.",8,0,3,16 September 2017
Braveheart," 'This is Sparta!'
","Well almost; the story which has no basis in reality, armies winning battles when hopelessly outnumbered, terrible terrible accents that are barely from the same planet let along the right region - this film is clearly one of the inspirations for '300'.This is my first viewing of the film, 23 years after its release. I'm pleased to say that I hadn't missed much.On the plus side, the cinematography and soundtrack were both beautiful.The rest was average at best. Presumably when Mel cast himself in the lead as a heroic, principled, freedom fighter he thought that only he would have the prowess and credibility to pull it off. Clearly Mel's ego is as vast as some of the panoramic shots in the film.The characters were all old school, the wicked king with his weak and childish son. The freedom fighter hero, who is inspired to fight by his beautiful dead wife, murdered by one of the men employed by the wicked king. The traitor who ultimately repents and finds redemption, and various other cliches live within this film. To be fair, these character types are classic for a reason.Despite my cynicism, I did generally enjoy the film, although now I've seen it I doubt i'll be rushing back for a second viewing.If you like the idea of Mel being the consummate hero freedom fighter then give it a whirl, if you find that tiresome then there are thousands of better films out there...",7,0,1,21 October 2018
The Great Gatsby," Good film
","Really enjoyed this film.It follows the plot of the book relatively faithfully. Visually it's a lovely film, well acted (even Toby McGuire seems well suited to his role).Some of the scenes are a little cartoonish, but I thought that added to the film. The music was brilliant, well chosen, and modern which worked really well even though the film is based in the 20s. I thought there could have been more of the party scenes just for their own visual pleasure.Overall, I would definitely recommend.",9,1,3,18 April 2015
