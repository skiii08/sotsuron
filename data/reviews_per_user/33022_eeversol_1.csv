Come and See," Edwin Eversole
","Elem Klimov is absolutely relentless in the direction, tone, and physical production of Come And See. Combining real time long takes, overwhelming audio, and journalistic acting the audience is forcefully put into the protagonists POV. The viewer endures bouts of earsplitting blows followed by lengthy deaf periods. These periods take place over endless shots while instilling a palpable ambiance to the scene. A story that historically receives less credit than it deserves is told with brilliant direction, photography, and acting (a rarity these days). Its cinematic worth is proved time and time again as it influences directors like Spielberg in their blockbuster productions.",10,3,4,8 June 2008
