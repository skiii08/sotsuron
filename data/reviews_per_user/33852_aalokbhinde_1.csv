Airlift," One of the best film in Indian Cinema
","Hats off the Akshay Kumar and his vision for making this beauty. I remember the last times I felt patriotic was during Border and Gadar. Airlift brings back that emotion, Airlift has one of Akshay Kumar's best performances. Simple if u don't know current affairs and you don't understand why war happens and who is Saddam Hussein and where Kuwait and Iraq is situated don't waster your time. I was 4 year old when Iraq invaded Kuwait but before going to watch the film I did my research and enjoyed thoroughly. The movie starts with a gripping war sequences and keeps you spell bounded with the story and actors performances. Akshay Kumar deserves a National Award this time for sure.",10,3,5,24 January 2016
