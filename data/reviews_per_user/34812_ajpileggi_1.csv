Hereditary," Can't Understand The Hate
","This is a great film. Top ten of the decade for me easily. I think because it's also a horror film it's getting trashed by people who were expecting a great genre movie. This is just a great movie period, it doesn't fit the horror mold, which thank God, 95% of horror movies are utter garbage. The director/writer is a true auteur and this movie will definitely be held on a pedestal for a long time. I will be lining up to see his next movie for sure.  If you are looking for jump scares and action, this might not be for you. If you enjoy an intense thrilling movie with lots to sink your teeth into and think about for a long time after, then check this movie out. This will be on a lot of recommendation lists for a long time by people that know what they are talking about. 
Don't let all the hate on here dissuade you from checking this out. I honestly barely heard anything about this and watched it yesterday and I'm shocked by all the low reviews, just doing my best to counteract them because again, I love this movie. 3000 stars!",10,12,22,23 August 2018
