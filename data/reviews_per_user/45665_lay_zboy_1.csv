Lucky Number Slevin," Review
","Having read The Times review of the movie by Cosmo Landesman after seeing the movie it made sense that he hated the film. One of the lines that stuck in my head was 'it succeeded in every way revolver failed' or words to that effect. He was right in a lot of ways as it didn't contain much of the psychological thrilling (or lack of) that revolver tried to inject into the movie in massive doses. That fact to me gave it a much better score as it kept the viewer intent on the story, and thus go you focused on the character development and the progression of Slevin's journey through 'mister nice guy' to the evil vengeful perpetrator of the bosses deaths.I'm comparing it to Revolver because to me they were similar in many ways ranging from the sets to the plot and given a few allowances they were basically built on the same premise. The reason i mention the sets was because i couldn't help but notice the wallpaper patterns being more or less the same but in different colours of tessellated patterns. There again bringing the relationship from Revolver because form what i can gather Guy Ritchie tried to make a strong statement of the mood of the film and the role of the characters in the movie by using colour and environment. Now i couldn't really gather at all what the relevance of the colours and sets meant but i definitely think they added some sort of subliminal undertone to the movies mood which given the end result of the movie worked very well.Of course not missing out the fact that the cast played a pivotal role in the 'success' (yet to be decided though) of the finished product of the film and I'm pretty sure that with average actors cast instead of the ones you saw there would have been a whole other film to watch. But it overall i think gave the viewer and without a doubt me a pleasure to watch as it had an intriguing plot, great cast, tasteful and graphic violence and a good old twist to throw you off the scent, given though the twist was if not a little blatant but ill let that go because the rest of the film made up for it in abundance.Its definitely going in my Top 250 thats for sure!!!",8,5,14,1 March 2006
