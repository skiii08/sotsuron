United 93," Powerful - Works like a gripping documentary
","If there were no political context to the story, this movie would still be a riveting suspense. From start to finish, it works like a well-made documentary, carefully focused on what happened and when. Throughout, the camera puts the viewer into the scene. The realism is complete.'United 93' presents in fact two stories, unfolding simultaneously. The first concerns the events aboard the flight itself. The second concerns the reactions of flight controllers and military authorities on the ground. Many of these latter characters were played in the movie by the actual people. In both stories, the film carefully shows how all these people came to the realization of what was happening that morning. This is the film's leitmotif.I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of political viewpoint. Without editorials, the movie simply tells the story. If it has any angle, it is the confusion and slow reaction of government employees on the ground. I don't think it is 'too early' to make such a movie and I didn't find this movie exploitative. ('From Here to Eternity' was made in less time, and no one claimed it was exploitative.) If art has a purpose, it surely is to engage a public conversation of events around us. This movie will certainly inspire discussion. As I walked out of the cinema in Montreal, people were already talking.",7,4,9,28 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," More Boring Pirates
","I fell asleep while watching this film in a THX cinema.  While this weakened my understanding of the film's plot, my 11 year old companion cheerily filled in the details on the drive home.I sympathized with Johnny Depp who, like me, seemed to have just woken up prior to many scenes.  While I was clueless as to what exactly was going on, Depp pulled off well his wake up calls and instead appeared to have a brilliant, original take on the plot twists.  Move Depp, on probation, into the 'watchable actor, sole reason for buying ticket' column.Hollywood producers accept pirate projects at their peril.  Maybe it's a challenge match for those with money to spare.  Someone today no doubt pitched a TV series based on the pirates in 'Six Days, Seven Nights'. Pirates.  Hollywood.  Fairbanks.  Swashbuckle.  Search me.",4,1,2,23 July 2003
Match Point," Gripping but disturbing
","I went to the cineplex, bought a ticket for a movie and then realized that I was too early for its start. With about 30 minutes to kill, I went into see the start of 'Matchpoint'. I knew it was a Woody Allen movie and while I don't hate Woody Allen, I'm not a die-hard fan either. I prefer his early comedies, and I tend to rent his movies on DVD when nothing else seems good. So, by watching the start, I thought I'd get a sense of the movie to decide whether it would be a later rental. I looked at my watch as the 30 minute mark ticked by and decided to stay for the rest of 'Matchpoint'. The other movie will get the financial credit from my ticket purchase, but Woody Allen gets the artistic credit. 'Matchpoint' is good, but disturbing. After watching it, and as I walked out of the cinema, I was almost angry with myself for having stayed. It's too disturbing.The script was originally written for Long Island but then it got transferred to London. In my view, this makes for a better movie. The cold phlegmatism of class-obsessed England gives a critical twist to the story. True, this opens the movie to the expected quibbles about accents, origins, habits, expressions, country houses and so on. In a sense, the Brits who make such criticisms are just proving the truth of the film's context. The script has also been compared to 'Crimes and Misdemeanours'. In my opinion, the characters in 'Crimes and Misdemeanours' openly reflected on their actions. In 'Matchpoint', any reflection is much, much more subtle. This is Dostoievski territory.Truth be told, Woody Allen on a bad day is better than most filmmakers on their best days. In 'Matchpoint', you are in the hands of a master. Since 'Matchpoint' puts an American character into a British setting, I suggest that you compare it with 'Notting Hill' or 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' or even 'Wimbledon'. Woody Allen puts them all to shame, but in a very disturbing way.",7,0,0,28 April 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Part of Americana
","Despite having heard much about this film over the years, I only recently saw it for the first time on DVD. I expected something good and I wasn't disappointed.  Despite being over 50 years old now, this is still an involving film.  You won't be bored.When first released, many people identified with 'The Best Years of Our Lives'.  Films now rarely if ever speak to a common, shared experience and instead, mass successes like 'Titanic' or 'Lord of the Rings' must rely on fantasy.  Maybe that's a good thing.  We live in a better world, as anyone watching this film can't help on reflection but realise.Three last points: I was struck at how much 'The Deer Hunter' owes to this film.  It was good to see genuine 1940s style instead of a modern production designer's recreations.  And I liked the scene at the end in the drugstore when Homer angrily asks whether the 400 guys on his ship were suckers too.",9,3,7,16 September 2003
American Beauty," My Two Cents...
","This film reflects what many non-Americans seem to think about America and Americans.  Except, the film uses American 'language' to make its point. Hence, the film is difficult for non-Americans to understand and at the same time, it seems surprising or fresh to some Americans.  (I suggest watching this film with an American/non-American.)With all that said, the film arguably misses the point about suburban, middle class Americans who, in my experience, are much more genuine and civilized.  In this, I found the film dishonest and more vapid than the characters it portrayed.Lastly, I hate pretentious films with devices such as floating plastic bags masquerading as artistic insights.  Gimme a break.  If you want a character study of rich middle-class Americans in crisis, rent 'Ordinary People'. It's more accurate and beautiful, but without the pretension.",4,1,2,16 September 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Remarkable War Movie with a Message
","A close Russian friend, a one-time tank commander, made me think seriously about this movie. He said, 'The first 20 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' make all other war movies look foolish.' He then continued, 'For example, that Hollywood movie 'Memphis Belle' is so silly.' Well, I happen to think 'Memphis Belle' is a good movie. And I must say that Spielberg copied the 'Hollywood' war-movie style of Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove'.Technical issues or even realism aside, the underlying message of 'Saving Private Ryan' is so strong, so well-put, and so human, that in my view it defies objection. I have wandered too many war cemeteries to think otherwise. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is also a good war movie but it makes the case for pacifism. The basic message of 'Saving Private Ryan' is not pacifist at all. It's something else altogether. But I suggest you see it and draw your own conclusions.Lastly, 'Saving Private Ryan' is so well-made that it bears repeated viewings. But if you dislike war movies, then you should still watch this movie once, if only for the message.",9,3,7,17 March 2005
Schindler's List," Masterpiece - Must See
","Given the number of comments here, it is probably superfluous to add my opinion. Nevertheless, I will - to express my three points. First, this film is a masterpiece both in its content and in its style. Notwithstanding 'Sophie's Choice' and other attempts to recount the Holocaust, the story of Schindler needed to be told. I am pleased that Spielberg told it and not, for example, Polanski or Scorcese. Spielberg (in some ways a Schindler himself, a guy with panache) relied on image, and feeling. (The most powerful scenes need no sound. Dialogue is often in Polish, German or Yiddish.) Spielberg tells Schindler's story without a Polanski edge, nor a Scorcese wantonness.Second, the choice of the pre-war Hungarian song 'Gloomy Sunday' lent authenticity as I watched, and has given me a reminder since. I can't hear other versions of this song now without thinking of this story.Third, watch for the girl's red dress because that's when Schindler realizes a truth, and somehow changes. At the end, watch for the woman spontaneously touch Schindler's grave with her hand. In all this terribleness, something good survived.",10,9,13,23 March 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," Still Going
","A friend dragged me to see this shortly after its cinema release and then, several years later, I showed it to a foreign friend on VHS. When the video store guy suggested it to me recently, I nodded, agreed and saw it again on DVD (with all the extras and Reiner's gray beard).This film still works for me and based on comments, it works for others too - even those who have discovered it in the DVD version.Good fun.  Comedy and more.  If you see this film, you will view any report of any rock group differently.",Null,0,2,8 June 2003
