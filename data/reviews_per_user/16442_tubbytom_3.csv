The Incredible Hulk," Went in hopeful, came out pleased
","Amazing movie, depicts the hulk more as beauty and the beast than the usual villainous more the heroic character in the past. Follows more of the original t.v. show with music, imagery and more life like than before. The CG was amazing it looked as if he was real with extreme muscle definition and all. The romantic side of the film was pleasantly kept to a minimum. Cameos, inside jokes and references were thrown in all over the place making it fun for comic book lovers and other movie goers. The movie has a slow start but it helps build the characters and one of the side female roles might confuse the audience. All in all i was expecting a great movie to put Ang Lee's flop to the past and this was a job well done.",9,3,9,13 June 2008
WALLÂ·E," Another Pixar Masterpiece
","Pixar has had a had a wonderful streak of making amazing movies. The movie has a deep message found through out the choices we have to make. Most of the movie is quiet due to the fact that there robots so there's not many conversations until near the end of the movie. This movie is a movie made for all ages. The Animation in this movie was incredible, but you should expect any less coming from pixar. The humor in the movie is simple but it makes the movie pretty good. The music in the movie made it seem like fantasia because it plays such a key role in the movie than just background music.Be sure to watch the movie until the credits too.",9,2,6,27 June 2008
Pineapple Express," Rogen and Goldberg redefine stoner flick genre.
","There are many reasons I am rating this movie for being a 10.Morals of the movie: 10 First off without even smoking about anyone can relate to this movie. For the fact that the movie is only drug influenced. It deals with issues people have in their friendships and relationships like trustworthiness, jealousy, self doubt and judging others.Comedy: 10 None of the jokes in the movie are overplayed and just passed the line to make it self inappropriate, this movie was trying to be as Naughty as Superbad or Scary Movie. The way the friends act towards each other and deal with situations make the movie what it is. Also the movie can surprise you at times when you start thinking predictable thoughts.Action: 10 This goes in the same category as comedy for the fact that its there but it never goes to far. Most situations that would happen in the movie could happen in real life, most have. The movie never goes Rambo and the 2 protagonist never instantly become trained killers instantly. Romance: 10Many can connect to the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend. Refer to above. This is definitely a movie your girl friend would love, its like a compromise of a chick flick and a movie for men.Intellectual Level: 8This movie would not make you dumber from watching it. Which is hard to say about this genre. Almost all the characters in the movie have a stoner mentality. But there not full blown idiots. They better them selves in the movie and learn lesson they've made. Most of the time movies have 1 main lesson this has many.Final Word about the movie:This movie is a unique movie that is meant for adults. This can actually put a meaning to adult humor now because most of the movie is loved through reflecting which Rogen and Goldberg have put in all there movies. This movie filled me it never has me thinking they could of done more. A must see.",10,7,24,6 August 2008
