E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Almost flawless!!
",I can't help but be a little irritated at the people knocking this film. I can only assume they have no heart or imagination. It is a beautiful film that tells it's story almost perfectly. I am saddened that people don't feel there is room for such a beautiful film in today's world - it's a sad indictment on our cynical society. Someone said that there's no humour in the film - it's filled with humour. Another said that the special effect's aren't up to much. I watch the film and believe that there's a little alien stuck on earth - so they work pretty well. There are no pointless effects that are only there for the sake of it as in many modern films. Maybe the people who feel that this film is overrated should go and watch the Phantom Menace - a soulless piece of film/merchandising but with plenty of good special effects.,10,0,1,29 December 2007
