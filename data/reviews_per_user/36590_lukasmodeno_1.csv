The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best
","Pretty much anyone who went to high school can relate to this movie but it's far from your typical high school drama. It has an interesting and unpredictable plot. The story is an emotional roller coaster with really sad and happy moments. The characters feel real and interesting. All three main actors did a great job playing their roles, truly convincing and passionate performances. The music is great and fits very well.To put it shortly, one of the best movies I've seen and one that I'll go back and watch again and again.",10,2,3,16 January 2018
