Captain Phillips," 8.1-are you kidding me!!!???
","That was another proof of how Hollywood is starting to fall-big time. The movie was rubbish. There was no logic in most of the scenes. The only good thing was Tom Hank's acting. I still try to realize why did no-one came the first day when the captain alarmed of pirates. And then we observe again for the 10000 time the full force of the US army, with big boats, helicopters, etc.-only a submarine was missing. I guess it was because Tom Hanks save Private Ryan while hundreds died a while ago, and now the seals are returning the favor. I did not understand why the pirates did not kill the captain while they were being towed -did they not understand that!!!!In two words-poor script. The only tensions was built by the music.",2,5,15,14 January 2014
