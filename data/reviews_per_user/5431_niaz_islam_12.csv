Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Absurd: Vol. 2
",As the title says the mission is to kill Bill at any cost. But on the way to killing him reality and logic was murdered.The acting of the characters was very pretentious throughout the film. Even the powerful actors and actresses looked foolish because of the mixture of conflicting extreme emotions. And the story premise made the main character invincible whenever needed and other times she was extremely vulnerable. And the build up with the dialogues were not followed by a strong scenes or actions.This type movie always lacks logic and have plot holes. But it lacked basic level of logic and abundant with plot holes. With a better script this movie could have reached the current highly overrated rating (8).Not recommended.,3,0,3,5 June 2020
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Totally Disappointed
","This movie is simply awful :( How could this movie get this kind of rating!!!In one word 'absurd'. I saw many types of degrading movie and I quit those type of movies. But the rating of this movie tricked me to watch this shi*ty movie :(If someone somehow stumble upon this review then I beg you not to watch this film , it may scar you for the rest of your life, People who find this movie entertaining must have some serious issues. So, I De-recommend it.Bottom Line: Do not watch this movie.",1,0,6,15 March 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Highly Overrated
","I watched this famous film expecting it will so much more but I was disappointed instead.The story is beyond absurd, the plot is weak and there was hardly any logic present. Indiana Jones was doing a lot of things in the film: explaining, exploring, running, fighting but what he was not doing is thinking. Often there was no rational explanations for his actions which made the film uninteresting. Every time he is in trouble, he gets out of it is the most absurd and unrealistic way possible. The performance of the actors and actresses was mediocre. As the story was not that good there was nothing much to be done by them either. On top of that the action scenes were not well crafted, in fact they were pretty clumsy. Also the editing of those scenes was less than good.If you are expecting an amazing movie then I will not recommend it but if you are seeking an average type action film to watch then you can watch this.",4,3,11,9 August 2017
Rang De Basanti," Overrated
","This film does not deserve this high rating.The story was a complete of cliche, as well as it was quite pointless. Main characters took some brash decisions out of nowhere just to make the story complicated. Then the story went crazy from there. If the story was not forced to match with the past story line then it could have been a enjoyable film but abrupt illogical turns of events actually wasted the real potential of the film.And the camera crew was trying to make the important scenes more interesting by shaking the frames but they over did that. As a result for those vital scenes camerawork was kind of sloppy and unappealing to the eye.Bottom line is that, It was an average movie. But watching this film will not be a waste of time.",3,2,5,8 August 2018
The Great Dictator," Far From Being A Classic
","Undoubtedly this is not Charles Chaplin's best work. This guy is a legend but sadly his performance in this film was not nowhere near legendary.The story was not well written and lacked quality humor in it. Some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and dull. If the film's run time was one and half hour long then the film would have been more enjoyable.Charles Chaplin's performance was good but it was not his usual excellent work. I think the script failed him badly. Because the story didn't stick to the character all the time, sometimes it went off the character and did something which does not fit the character they build up.All in all it is a good movie but does not deserve this much high ratings.",3,0,6,8 August 2017
Dangal," Simply A Masterpiece
","Dangal is the living proof of how much Indian movies have improved over the past decade. Everything about this film was just amazing.Casting was excellent and that is the reason why acting of the most actors' and actresses' was so enjoyable throughout the film. Almost everyone's performance impeccable and a real treat to watch.But what astounded me the most is the screenplay, it was simply sublime. The script was not only well written and careful about tiniest details but also sends a pretty strong message about women empowerment. It was also able to depict almost all the troubles Mahavir Singh and his family face in the society. That is why I have to say Director Nitesh Tiwari did a splendid job in filming this movie.I do not want write much about the film because I want you all to go watch this outstanding film. And that is the only way you will be able to understand how great the movie is.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",10,1,4,8 June 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Not changed a bit
","This is not 2001 anymore. Lot has been changed. Yet this movie remains the same. > In this movie no major villain die :( > In this movie nobody achieve nothing > And the worst part is when some one is about to die or slain, there comes help immediately bullshit... not a second earlier ,or a second later. > They have eagles but they won't ride them at the first time or whole the distance because then they will not face any trouble :P > Director always focus the elvish sword ... yet he do not put it in real use in the movie... > And so onActually I did not like this movie.... I lost my valuable time watching this movie :( I Could Have Been Like It If It Was Made 10-15 Years Ago .",4,4,9,8 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Senseless Story
",Marvel did it again; spent a loads of money on CGI and brought in lots of unnecessary characters for no good reason to make a blockbuster and completely ignore the script in the process.The story is full of plot holes. It was written very poorly and lacks basic logic. The film does not make any sense altogether. But I do have to give credit to the dialogues of Drax (Dave Bautista); they were extremely funny. Those are the only things I find entertaining in the entire film.Despite high ratings and metascore this film is a below average film with a crappy script.Not Recommended.,3,8,15,30 September 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Severe Lack Awe And Fear
","One can easily name this movie 'How To Ruin A Classic' and it will make no difference. The story is okay and the plot is average. But the acting and the directing was terrible. I am not saying that the cast was not good, it was their performance in the movie which was a huge let down. The most lame scene was when, after few decades John C. Reilly saw people from the outside world and there was no real enthusiasm in his reaction. Not to mention the excellent condition of his outfit after so many years.Now about acting. Throughout the film, seeing the amazing creatures for the first time in their life, there was no actual awe or fear in the actors' or actresses' eyes or even in their body language. It was as if every day they watch this sort of animals in the street. And even when they tried to interact with these animals, their behavior was unrealistic as if they are staring at a wall. They should have practice acting using green screen before the actual shooting. Only then they could have given a better performance than this, which frankly looked like they were interacting with wall without any real emotion. They should watch and learn from the film Okja to learn how to act with a imaginary animal. If a little child could perform so nicely then it should be easier for them.Director also have to take the blame for their performance because he failed to bring out the realistic performance out from them because he didn't provide them the necessary motivation, persuasion or even the feeling of real life environment of the scenes in the set. The movie has great CGI though. So if you like those kind of effects then you might even enjoy the film. But performance-wise there is nothing to see really.Not Recommended.",3,1,2,13 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," Must Watch
","â€ŽCloud Atlas Is Quite A Movie. Real Eye Opener. Strong Inspirational Film. That Every One Will Definitely Enjoy And Learn From. This movie start with some ambiguity. But towards the end everything started to make more sense. It will surely affect your heart and conscience. :) I recommend it for everyone. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.Hope you will also do that.Acting is great. Story line is also great. The most amazing thing is the dialogues. And there is pace in the script. So you always stay attached with the film. So please watch this movie. If you do not enjoy first time,then you need to watch the movie multiple times but eventually you would understand the whole movie and will start to love the movie.",9,10,19,8 January 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Huge Letdown - Killing Only Killing
","After 'The Expendables' this is another ridiculous movie that I watched where everybody on the other side dies like flies but Keanu Reeves stays unharmed.This was an action film but I could not like the action scenes at all. The action sequences were very clumsy where people comes out in open to just die. The way they got shot it looked very pathetic. Another thing when Keanu Reeves reloads his weapon there was nobody but as soon as he finished reloading somebody resumes attack. And the story line was another let down, barren of any logic in the story at all. They tried to put some comedy in but failed horribly. There was no well thought plan or clever steps to awe the audience, it was only full of killings. Keanu Reeves probably killed 70-80 people in the film. And that is all there is to watch in this film. Even Keanu Reeves failed to depict the devil-may-care attitude so I couldn't enjoy the film at all.NOT RECOMMENDED.",1,34,68,30 May 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Really Don't Get It
",I really do not get these Indiana Jones movies at all. These are all average adventure films but evidently somehow in IMDb they got the best ratings.Like other Indiana Jones films this one also has a weak script which is full of plot holes. There was hardly any logic in the story. Although acting was decent but without a strong story the film was not that enjoyable.The action scenes are the most weird of all. They tried to add comedy in these scenes which made them rather childish. They should have these scenes intense and serious instead.Overall it is an average film and good way to spend your spare time.,4,0,10,23 September 2017
