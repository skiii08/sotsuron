The Sound of Music," In My Personal Top-Ten of All Time
","Has Julie Andrews ever appeared on film more beautifully than in this film? Has she ever sung with such richness and gusto as is captured here? As a big fan of hers, I can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.Wise and his cinematographer have photographed Andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. Watch the scene where Maria watches the Captain sing Edelweiss with the kids. Wise turns her into a gauzy angel. It is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.I am firmly in a camp that says Julie Andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 Oscars were handed out. She embodied Maria Von Trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of 'Do-Re-Mi'; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. Or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it's as if even SHE can't believe she's hitting that note).The Julie Christie performance that beat Andrews is now all but forgotton. 'The Sound of Music,' however, lives on and on.'The Sound of Music' is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and Julie Andrews specifically. But what a legacy it (and she) have left!",Null,112,166,8 December 1998
North by Northwest," My Favorite Hitch
","'North by Northwest' is my favorite of all Hitchcock films (a close shave with 'Rear Window'), and it permanently occupies a slot in my Personal Top Ten Films of All Time.Grant is terrific--funny, sexy, angry, confused, exhausted, redeemed. It is a full-bodied performance. And speaking of bodies--Eva Marie Saint is *definitely* an asset here, not just for her looks (there's that cool, blond Hitch femme fatale again) but for showing off her acting chops as well.James Mason is a consumate actor, and Hitch gives him a vehicle to enter one of his finest performances. Martin Landau, too, is appropriately chilling.Favorite scenes? The crop-dusting sequence is certainly a classic. But I love the scenes with Roger and his mother, dickering over his 'drunkenness.' And the auction is Hitch in his element: the scene plays tense and terse but also funny.I can quibble with this film: The blue-screening looks a bit cheesy nowadays. And the movie opens with a huge plot hole (when the page is searching for George Kaplan and Thornhill grabs his ear for a quick question, Mason et.al. believe Thornhill to be their man, setting off the entire plot. However, shouldn't the page have continued searching the room, calling for Mr. Kaplan? And shouldn't the villains have heard him continue to page, knowing that Thornhill wasn't who they assumed he was? Ahh, but that would blow the whole movie!).This film also contains the best 'naughty joke' Hitchcock ever devised. The final sequence is Eva Marie Saint and Grant pulling each other into bed. The jump cut is to a train entering a tunnel. You figure it out.",Null,60,86,9 December 1998
Toy Story," One of the Top Ten Movies of the 1990s
","If there's any justice in this crazy world of ours, 'Toy Story' will become a classic in the mode of 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Snow White.' I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated 'event.'It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do.But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people.Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from 'Raiders,' and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter '...of the Third Kind,' of course, should echo in your mind.The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it 'works' in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football.I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his 'look.'But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed...",Null,2,2,1 February 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Trot Out the Accolades--It's Unparalleled
","This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like 'Singin' in the Rain.'There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking ('She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!') and the sheer energy of the musical numbers ('Fit as a Fiddle,' 'Good Mornin'').Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to 'You Were Meant for Me.' Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.Great stuff!If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it!PS: In the 'rent-this-too' category, if you've seen and love 'Singin' in the Rain,' check out 'The Band Wagon.' It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!",Null,70,98,1 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," The BEST Reason to Endure Subtitles Since 'Cinema Paradiso'
","I'm not a big fan of foreign films. I guess it has something to do with the subtitles--do we read them or watch the action? All that eye-flipping between the words and the actors tires me after a while.But every so often, a movie comes around that makes it all worthwhile. 'Life Is Beautiful' is just such a picture.Begnini, he of the rubber face, exaggerated gait, and fall-down demeanor, is brilliant here, wearing the three hats of writer/director/star. And his wife, as Dora, is simply gorgeous--the type of woman you would, indeed, rescue from a stuffy engagement party riding a green horse!The subtle swap between this movie's romantic/comedic first half and its more grim second is masterful. The scenes of Guido wooing Dora are cinematic magic--watch Guido use a set of predetermined occurrences convince Dora that even the heavens believe he's right for her. Brilliant!And the concentration camp sequences are magical as well. What parent--having those resources at hand--wouldn't go to the same lengths to protect a little one? The scene in which Giuido 'translates' for a German officer, for example, works because the ruse is born of his desparation. Using the only tools at his disposal, he concocts his fanciful tale. Yes, it's hilarious, but it's heartbreaking as well.Sure, the remainder of the movie stretches believability a bit, but considering the life-affirming purpose behind this stretch, I found it all worthwhile.Also, reviews here (and elsewhere) have slammed this movie for being a Polyanna-ish examination of the holocaust. Not in my book. No happy ending here. Joyous, yes, but not exactly cheery!'Life is Beautiful' marks the first time in a long time that I didn't complain over the prospect of reading subtitles. It also represents the first time in a long time I cried copiously in a movie theater.Seek it out. Laugh. And cry. For life is, truly, beautiful!",Null,1,2,18 January 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Atop my Top Ten
","I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include 'Fantasia,' 'To Kill A Mockingbird,' 'Casablanca,' 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'North by Northwest,' and 'The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is 'It's a Wonderful Life.'I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as '...the richest man in town.' The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.",Null,379,409,9 December 1998
To Kill a Mockingbird," An Unforgettable Drama
","Hoo boy, am I a sucker for courtroom dramas. The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).'To Kill a Mockingbird' rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.'To Kill a Mockingbird' also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing 'Ponette,' a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in 'Mockingbird' received my best child performance ever awards. 'Ponette' has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn't diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen 'Mockingbird,' I pity you. You've passed on one of Hollywood's most unforgettable experiences.",Null,171,212,9 December 1998
