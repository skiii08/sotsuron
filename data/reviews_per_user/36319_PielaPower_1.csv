Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The definition of comedy
","i literally laughed my ass off from beginning till end, there was rarely a minute that i didn't laugh, and there were frequent moments where i laughed so hard i could barely breath, and kicked the people in the seat in front of me. the humor can be considered crude, and at times a wee bit mean. This, i believe is the reason why there has been so much critizism. was the movie Horrible? no. crude? yes. that's the difference. If you're a prude, don't see this movie, u'll think it's crappy and put it down. Yes the jokes can be mean, but they're there to make us laugh, not to be mean, some of you all take these jokes way to literally, so if your one of those people do not see this movie. But for me it was by far the funniest movie i've ever seen i left the movie theater with sore stomach, headache and sore jaw muscles all because i laughed so hard",10,1,23,20 January 2007
