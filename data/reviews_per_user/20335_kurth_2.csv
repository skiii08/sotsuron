Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great film
","I went to it because there was a midnight showing the Tuesday when it opened on Wednsday and all my friends were going.  I liked star wars, I'm now a huge fan but I think the movies are good.  I went to this having heard bad reviews  I figured it would be okay but not anything special, well now I've seen it four times, try and guess what I thought of it.  It's not the best I've seen but it is a great film to go and watch.  You just have to forget that the computer effects make it seem as though the technology is decades past 'A New Hope', that was the main problem I had with the film.  This last time I saw it I thought of something, the movie never says anything about Uncle Owen who was Lukes fathers, you know Anakin's, brother.  Listening to things in A New Hope it sounds like Owen didn't think it was a good idea for Anakin to leave Tatooine, but Owen was nowhere in PH when Ani left.  So those two things, plus there is probably other stuff but these are what I've thought of, could make the movie seem bad.  You just have to remember its a movie and movies have mistakes, you just have to say so what.  If you do and if you liked the old movies or you just like cool action sequences you'll like this movie.  Well now I have to talk about those cool action sequences. The fight between the jedi and Maul are great they are film wonderfully and I just love the speed.If you watch Obi-Wan's little side ponytail thing you'll see its always on the right side except for two times.  First right away in the Gungan city when the guard approaches for like two seconds its on the left.  Second in the desert after receiving the ship parts its on the left for several shots. Check it out and see for yourself.Oh yea I forgot this movie is supposed to beat Titanic, you have to go or keep going.  Titanic was in for over six months to make the money PM is over half way in a month and a half.  It can do it we just have to make it happen.  Think about it Titanic dethrowned Star Wars so lets have Star Wars dethrown Titanic.",9,0,0,23 June 1999
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Possible Spoiler Definite Rant
","The more I thought about it after seeing the movie the more it made me mad. It is different from the book in a few small ways that I don't mind and I am not going to get into how, except that having the firebolt in the movie as it was in the book could have been nice. My real problem with this movie is how much they didn't put in that is pretty much standard Harry Potter movie stuff. After the first game of quittich they never even mention it again, harry falls off his broom in the first match you'd assume he never played again or something because they never mention it, they could have at least thrown a word in here or their without adding too much length to the movie. They movie Hagrid from his shack in the main courtyard and never explain anything about it, you can assume it was because of his new position, but it would be nice if that were explained. Hagrids new hutt wouldn't have been so bad except that they never even showed the courtyard again. Not only the courtyard was gone but just about every set I could recognize from the first movie was either different or shot at a different angle and appeared different. It was like they remodeled over the summer or something, nothing was recognizable. Dumbledore, don't get me started. I understand when an actor dies you can't always find someone who will meet the expectations. But the original actor played dumbledore so softly spoken, everything about the way he talked and moved was calming, this new guy seems more loud and harsh. It made him seem less friendly and even less knowing somehow. Also, Harry didn't talk to dumbledore once through the movie that I recall. It should be a standard for Harry to have a consultation with Dumbledore at least once each movie. The house cup, where was it, one time in the movie you hear '5 points from griffendore' but never again does anyone even mention it. At the same time the end doesn't have the standard 'the year is over' speech from dumbledore and an announcing of who won the cup.The movie wasn't horrible. I thought as it's own movie it was good, just as a series there is a formula to follow and this new director and the writers didn't follow it. Don't change sets or viewing angle to change what the set looks like, unless you explain why. Don't take out standard parts of Hogwarts school unless it's explained that something changed. (ie, housecup, quittich) If you have to find a new actor to portray a character, let them make the character their own, we will get over it, but don't give them as few appearances as possible.",Null,0,0,7 June 2004
