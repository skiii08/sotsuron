10 Cloverfield Lane," Just don't.....
","I never write reviews. ever. This is probably my first EVER.This movie was so bad that I had to write this review and even if one person doesn't watch it because of my review, I will feel accomplished.98-99% of the movie is in a bunker with two guys and a girl. I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen and finally last few minutes of the movie. The girl finally escapes the bunker (she was originally forced into it) just to find out most of the Earth is taken over by aliens and the best part, she was able to destroy one alien ship with a bottle of liquor. For a girl who runs away from one sign of problems, she did pretty good with an alien chasing her and a ship carrying her in a car in the air. Like what?I can't anymore. I just can't.Why can't I vote 0 stars?",1,195,360,6 May 2016
