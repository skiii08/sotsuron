The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I didn't find too many perks to being a wallflower
","Many who watch this movie are in love with this movie, judging by its ratings and reviews, however I did not find it very memorable. Perhaps this is because the main character annoys me. Looking back on high school I realise how difficult children and teens make it out to be however I think it is probably more difficult to not make any friends than it is to make friends. When he decides to bravely go and sit next to Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) he was easily accepted and Patrick welcomed him with open arms. I also find many of these characters very flamboyant and theatrical and the friendships seemed a little bit fake and only seen in movies.On the alternative, I do feel this movie is capable of giving hope to many teenagers. Many feel alone and introverted at school and this movie shows that it is not difficult to make friends at school, however do not mess it up like he does at one point in the movie. Other lessons we gain from this film is to follow your heart, however the fact that movies always portray a happy ending to love stories is not always the case in real life and therefore need to be careful.Even though I felt Patrick was very over the top and a very rare character to find in real life, I loved him. I loved the care free attitude he had, his confidence he had in himself and the advice he gives main actor Charlie. Patrick is a homosexual this movie portrays a stereotypical way gays act. I do feel that it was necessary to portray him this way as we love Patrick in this movie and perhaps society will subconsciously start accepting gays more into society.",6,2,3,3 November 2015
Despicable Me," Not a despicable movie to watch
","We watched Despicable Me as a class the other day. To the surprise of the class it was my first time. As we are all over the age of 20 it was to my surprise that all of them HAD. I am not always one to select an animated film as I feel I am more into action or suspense, however I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I smiled a lot, laughed frequently and even cried a little, learning that adults too can enjoy animated movies. It needs to be this way as children are drawn to watch animated movies and the adults are the ones who accompany the children when they go to watch the movies. There was lots of humour and 'silly' parts which did not seem silly as it is animated and all is possible in animation. Animated movies always accompany morals or life lessons and there are many you can gain from this film for example: family should stick together, nothing with great magnitude can be accomplished alone, when you give to others, you will receive, don't give up, and more! however I do not want to give spoilers as to how!",8,0,0,23 November 2015
