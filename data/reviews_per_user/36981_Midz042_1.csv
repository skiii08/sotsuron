Iron Man 3," The Best Experience I've ever had!
","I was lucky enough to see a screening of the film last night and all i can say was that it was AH- MAZING! There was a great narrative and the use of visual effects was amazing. The work that was put into make the film truly shows which is what made it amazing (besides the actors of course). Robert Downey Jr was amazing because you got to see a different side of him (i won't say more because i don't want to spoil it), but honestly he truly did kick it up a notch acting wise (at least thats what i think from the previous one). There are some big twists (which i won't say what once again because of spoiler alert) which if your a hardcore fan of Marvel might be 50/50 about it. For the people who love action you will truly love it the visual effects that were used made this film truly amazing! For me they truly kicked it up a notch from the previous Iron Man when it came to the visual effects used in the action sequences! Overall i thought it was a truly amazing experience and loved the film very much! And will watch it again! 10/10",Null,42,88,19 April 2013
