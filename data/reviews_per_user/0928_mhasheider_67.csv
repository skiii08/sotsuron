The Legend of Bagger Vance," A spectacular feat.
","A smart and beautifully shot old-fashioned sports tale about a young man, Rannuplh Junuh (Matt Damon) who was a rising star in golf until he left to fight in the first World War, comes home afflicted by the horrors he witnessed, and is quickly urged into playing an exhibition golf match against Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill).The film boasts an excellent cast here with Damon in the lead role and backed by with some good performances by Charlize Theron as Junuh's old flame, Adele; Will Smith as Bagger Vance, a gentle caddy who comes out of the dark to help Rannulph prepare for the match, J. Michael Moncrief as the young Hardy Graves, a kid who tags along with Vance and Junuh, and Jack Lemmon also appears uncredited as the older Hardy and is the film's narrator.Robert Redford who has directed some memorable films as 'Ordinary People' and 'A River Runs Through It', deserves credit for handling the film with ease and extreme care.  Jeremy Leven writes a solid story and adapted it from the Steven Pressfield novel.  Michael Ballhaus, the film's cinematographer, makes the movie look great with some shots of the fairways that made me think of Augusta National, where the Masters Tournament is played at.  It's a shame that Ballhaus didn't get an Oscar nomination for his efforts here.'Bagger Vance' reminded me of one thing that movies are made to make people enjoy and cherish every moment.  The movie itself is a spectacular feat.",9,0,1,5 April 2001
Chinatown," Fair film noir-like mystery thriller.
","Fair film noir-like mystery thriller that takes place in L.A. before WW2 and follows the unpredictable trail that private eye Jake Gittes (Jake Nicholson) takes and eventually caught up in a mess over water.  What kept me from really enjoying the movie is that director Roman Polanski chose the pace to be slow as maple syrup.  Despite that flaw, I found a few aspects of the film (cinematography, acting, musical score, etc.) to be fascinating and impressive.  Faye Dunaway is okay as the wealthy widow who Gittes falls for. Film legend John Huston is clever here as Noah Cross, a shady and wise millionaire who asks Gittes to find his daughter's only child.  Even Polanski appears in the movie as a dwarfish hoodlum who uses a knife to leave a cut on Jake's nose.  Robert Towne won an Oscar for his screenplay. 'CHINATOWN' isn't great as I thought it would be, but I was satisfied to say the least.",8,0,2,6 August 2001
Memento," A hypnotic and enticing mystery.
","Sharp and absolutely unmericiless thriller about Leonard (Guy Pearce - L.A. Confidential) whose wife has been savagely murdered and he (Pearce) wants to get the person who did it.  There's one problem, Leonard can't produce new memories and that leaves him to relying on Polaroid pictures, tattoos on his body, and the assistance of two strangers Natalie (Carrie Ann-Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano).  How writer-director Christopher Nolan came up with the notion of telling this eerie and unusual tale in reverse order and do I want to know?  No thanks, I'll just watch and enjoy the movie.  A hypnotic and enticing mystery.  One more thing, the members of the Academy shouldn't ignore this film when the Oscar nominations are announced.",9,0,2,17 September 2001
Shakespeare in Love," A shrewd and charming romantic comedy.
","A shrewd and charming romantic comedy about the well-known playright William Shakespeare (Joesph Fiennes), who's fighting a severe case of writer's block and the cure comes in the form of Lady Viola de Lessops (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Set in London during the infamous Plague, the indomintable reign of Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), and only men (not women) portrayed women in staged plays.  The Bard's latest play, a comedy that was originally titled as 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's daughter' then changed to 'Romeo and Juilet', a romantic tragedy.  Top-notch writing and directing and first-rate performances definitely make this film an instant classic hands down.  There are plenty of funny moments throughout the movie and one notable example would be when Shakespeare and his actors get into a hilarious, all-out brawl with another theater owner and his men.  Paltrow and Dench both won Oscars for their memorable performances and I'm happy that the film won 'Best Picture' instead of 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'.  Why Fiennes didn't get an Best Actor nomination baffles me even to this day. Rupert Everett appears here as Christopher Marlowe and is unbilled.",10,5,9,31 July 2001
Billy Elliot," A real dandy that's without doubt one of the year's best.
","Inspired by the actual events surrounding a strike by British coal-miners in the mid-eighties, 'Billy Elliot' is the tale of Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), an eleven year-old boy who is slowly, but quickly attracted to ballet dancing and is taught by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), the chain-smoking dance instructor to become one himself despite that his grumpy Dad (Gary Lewis) and Billy's older brother, Tony (Jamie Draven) who once oppose Billy's dream before seeing the potential that Billy has.  It's well-acted by all (notably Bell, Lewis, and especially Walters, who garned a Best Supporting Actress nomination), masterfully written by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Daldry, who both earned Oscar nominations.  Unfortunately, the film is another innocent casualty of the MPAA, who has given it an 'R' rating (and not 'PG-13') although the F-word is mentioned several times, but it's used in a respectful manner and not carelessly.  I honestly don't get it?  Despite that fact, 'Billy Eliot' is a real dandy that's without doubt one of the year's best.",9,0,0,18 April 2001
Blade," A terrific mix of 'Highlander', 'Death Wish', 'Lethal Weapon', and the typical vampire movie.
","'Blade' is more than just an ordinary vampire movie.  It's a terrific mix of 'Highlander', 'Death Wish', 'Lethal Weapon', and the typical vampire movie.It's a highly entertaining tale of Blade (Wesley Snipes), a vampire hunter who is half-human and half-vampire and Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a blood hematologist who try to take down Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a rebelious Immortal vampire lord who with his wild right-hand man, Quinn (Donal Logue) have declared war on mankind.The performances by Snipes and Dorff are great, but Wright and Kris Kristofferson, who plays Whistler, another vampire hunter who is Blade's mentor and supplies Blade with the weaponry are even more interesting to watch.I have to admit that it's a better movie about vampires than John Carpenter's 'Vampires' starring James Woods was.  There a few reasons why: the story by David S. Goyer is wonderful and very creative based on the comic book.  Mark Isham's musical score is great to listen to and helps the film in some of the battle scenes.  The cinematography by Theo van de Sande is masterfully shot with care.Overall, 'Blade' is a movie that has some unique twists that pay off big time.",8,0,1,5 October 2000
The Natural," Three words: Pure movie magic.
","Incredible story of true courage and overcoming adversity that follows Robert Redford (in one of his best roles) as a former prodigy, Roy Hobbs, who resurfaces in the thirties to help a struggling baseball team make a run for the National League pennant. Not only Redford is great here, but so is the supporting cast.  Glenn Close, Kim Basigner, and Barbara Hershey are among the women whom he meets, Robert Duvall is the sports reporter who isn't sure if Hobbs has anything left to prove, Robert Prosky and an unbilled Darren McGavin show their doubts, and Wilford Brimely and the late Richard Farnsworth are the bench coaches who give Hobbs a chance to play again.The movie is based on the novel by Bernard Malamud and it's treated like glass in the direction of Barry Levinson, who's made some bad choices in recent time ('Sphere', 'Toys', and my least favorite - 'Sleepers').  Another noteworthy is the musical score by Randy Newman and the Norman Rockwell-like scenry provided by Caleb Deschanel.I can sum up 'The Natural' in three words: pure movie magic.  This movie show us the bright side of baseball when it's not tainted by bitter labor disputes, or ugly bench-clearing brawls.",9,0,1,11 September 2002
Chicken Run," Wow! This movie is great.
","'Chicken Run' is a wildly great animated tale of a boasting rooster named Rocky (Mel Gibson) who flies right into a chicken camp that has the resembelence of prison for war prisoners.  Rocky is asked by Ginger (Julia Swahulia), a courageous hen who is determined to get out of the camp before the owners, hen-pecked Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) and devilish Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) turn the whole camp of hens into pot pies.    Nick Park and Peter Lord, who had great success with the 'Wallace and Gromit' series, wrote and directed the film with a solid touches of humor and intelligence.    This film also makes a great reference to several old WW2 prison movies, notably 'Stalag 17' and 'The Great Escape'.    Besides the kids, adults should enjoy and cherish this film.",10,0,0,1 November 2000
L.A. Confidential," A top-notch murder mystery that overwhelms you with the numerous key details.
","Sharp and stunning crime-noir gem based on the novel by James Ellroy that shows three L.A. policemen (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce) each of whom get entangled in a tricky yet treacherous web of nasty homicides, sizzling personal affairs, and corruption in the department.Director Curtis Hanson ('Wonder Boys') and his writers have unveiled an impressive but puzzling whodunit-type of thriller.  The first time that I watched this movie, I was hooked on right from the get go, and 'L.A. Confidential' packs more tension and suspense than Roman Polanksi's 'Chinatown'.  Even the dialogue has little doses of humor that would leave you giggling with delight.The three leads here (Spacey, Pearce, and Crowe) remarkably hold their ground here as does the supporting cast (Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, David Straithairn, etc.).  Basinger won an supporting Oscar here as a woman who draws the attention of the Crowe and Pearce characters.A top-notch murder mystery that overwhelms you with the numerous key details.",10,2,3,6 November 2002
Sleepy Hollow," This is how the tale should be told and made.
","A good old-fashioned and gothic-like thriller that provides some 'real' nail-biting moments that's based on the novel by Washington Irving.  The tale follows Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a moody constable who is sent up to the small community of 'Sleepy Hollow' in upstate New York to investigate a series of strange and grisly murders.  When Crane arrives, he doesn't get a lot of cooperation from the locals even though they tell him that a 'headless horseman' committed the vicious murders.  Plus, Crane is told that the horseman was a former Hessian mercenary, played by 'a very scary' looking Christopher Walken. The performances (Depp, Walken, Christina Ricci, etc.) are great and so is the musical score by Danny Elfman and Emmanuel Lubezli's photography of the gloomy scenery.  I like the fact that director Tim Burton ('Batman') doesn't let his screenwriters (Andrew Kevin Walker and make-up whiz Kevin Yagher) follow the same story as several other adaptions have done before this one.  Martin Landau appears unbilled.  'Sleepy Hollow' shows that this is how the tale should be made and told.",10,0,0,26 July 2001
We Were Soldiers," Merciless and simply unforgiving.
","A fine and acceptable account of the first major battle in Vietnam between the N.V.A. and the U.S. forces in the Ia Drang Valley, as known as 'The Valley of Death'. The movie is well-cast with Mel Gibson, Chris Klein, and Sam Elliott who portray the high-ranking members of the seventh Air Calvary division who lead the unit of four hundred men into the area, nearly walk into a major bushwhack (or ambush), and discover their counterpart have more troops (2,000 to be exact). Plus, it shows some scenes where the wives of the soldiers (Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among them) who were or weren't prepared to deal with the fact that their loved ones might not come back alive. That's how war is - merciless and simply unforgiving.Writer/Director Randall Wallace, who in directing his second film here, has the tough task of handling the scenes, and he shows no problems in doing so. The movie has a small mix of Samuel Fuller, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone. And there's a couple of nice touches at the movie. The first one being Gibson character writing to a widow of a dead NV soldier and the second one decading this movie to those who died in the fight.",10,4,6,14 October 2002
MASH," The father of black comedies.
","I enjoyed 'MASH', the classic t.v. series and I'll say the same for the movie version, which is also a classic.   It's a great and wildly funny tale of two rebelling surgeons, 'Hawkeye' (Donald Sutherland) and 'Trapper John' (Elliot Gould), who both turn the camp into a zoo when they're not working on wounded American soldiers during the Korean War.  How they get rid of another surgeon, Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) is good and make the life of the camp's head nurse, Major 'Hot Lips' O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman) a living nightmare is even more hilarious.   The movie was directed by Robert Altman, who deserved an Oscar as does as Sutherland and Gould.   Overall, 'MASH' is the father of black comedies.",10,2,7,24 October 2000
Blade II," Just as good as the original, if not better.
","Terrific yet even more violent sequel as Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson reprise their roles from the first movie and director Guillermo del Toro runs the show here. The story, written by David S. Goyer here is even more complex as Blade (Snipes) who bails out his mentor/sidekick Whistler (Kristofferson), who from a lab, and the duo and the new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus) are urged by the vampire nation to assist them in riding the world of a new threat that are called 'Reapers' and their feared ringleader, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).The Reapers themselves, are certainly a work of art, and not only they feed on humans, but vampires, too.  That's why has the nation deeply concerned and they see their bitter rival Blade and Whistler to lead the crusade.Blade, Scud, and Whistler are soon paired with the Bloodpack, a buffed up and ambitious version of 'The Wild Bunch' or 'The Dirty Dozen' (take your pick).  The unit's sole purpose was to kill Blade and they're led by Nyssa (Lenor Varela), the king's daughter and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), who sort of resembles Victor Franko minus the hair.Once the bunch find their targets, the movie begins to get very intense and the fight scenes are brutal, so I'll put at that.  There are some unexpected surprises that follow and you're not sure what will happen.Director Guilllero Del Toro is no stranger to making movies that deal with vicious creatures.  'Cronos' and 'Mimic' are a couple of noteworthy examples.  And here, he takes the film in a direction in the way someone drives down a back road at night, not knowing what they run into.  You ask yourself 'Where do you find the suspense in that?''Blade II' asks the same question and you don't how to answer that.  Well, it's just as good as the original, if not better.",9,0,1,11 September 2002
Alien," A good reason that no one should like being alone in the dark.
","Remarkable (and ingenius) mix of pure science fiction and horror (or suspense) as the crew of a mining ship who have an unexpected guest board their vessel on an unknown planet and the strange chain of events that take shortly thereafter.Director Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver both made a name for themselves due to their efforts here.  And so does the rest of the supporting cast (Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright, Yaphet Kotto, and Harry Dean Stanton) deserve some mention for their portrayals here.'Alien' is one of those films that shows that no one should like being alone in the dark.  I remember watching the commercial for the movie when it was going to be shown on network t.v. during the eighties.  Just seeing the creature make its' way around the ship just scared of the daylights out of me alone.  That's how great this movie is.",8,0,1,25 September 2002
Taxi Driver," It's more than an art house masterpiece....It's a national treasure that we should use as a constant reminder.
","Moody and near sheer flawless depiction of an isolated, aloof former war veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), who spends his nights in New York driving a taxi cab, sees the endless amount of low-lives (prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, etc.), and slowly becomes determined to make his presence felt throughout the city.Furthermore, what makes this movie leave such an unforgettable impact on the viewer is how director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader set-up the jungle-like atmosphere and I begin to get the feeling that the people like Bickle are animals, not the same type.  Is everyone who lives and works in the Big Apple almost identical?  Not absolutely.Even the views of the night life in the city, that are provided by cinematographer Michael Chapman, reminded me some of the Renissance paintings that I saw in high school.  It's just beautiful, simple as that. And the musical score, which is the last one composed by the legendary Bernard Herrmann ('Psycho', 'Carrie') is something that you want to listen if you aren't a big fan of modern music.  The music flows to a slow, but smooth jazz rhytmn and I bet a (high school or college) music teacher would love that.Last but not least, the performances are definitely memorable and de Niro himself isn't alone.  Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, Cybill Shepherd, and Harvey Keitel round out the marvelous cast.  Plus, Scorsese himself has a nice cameo as an unhappy passenger who tells Travis what he wants to do.  That scene alone and the mind para-lyzing climax, which I wouldn't dare throw away, pick up where 'Death Wish' left off with the revenge factor, and take it to staggering heights.In conclusion, 'Taxi Driver' does teach the viewer a valuable lesson that shouldn't be forgotten, period.  It makes you think about what you choose the way you live and view any situation.  A wake-up call, at best.  It's more than an art house masterpiece....It's a national treasure that we should use as a constant reminder.",10,0,0,13 May 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Not a great film, but one that's provocative and serious.
","Bizarre yet fairly entertaining perspective from one Marine, Joker (Matthew Modine who is also the film's narrator) who fought in the Vietnam War.  The late Stanley Kubrick who directed the movie, divided it into two seperate parts (one for basic training and the other one based only in combat) or three if you want to count to reporting in the field.
One of the problems that I had with the movie is that it lacked appeal and to top that off, the drill instructer, Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a former D.I. in real life) spends most of his time, shouting out nasty and outrageous comments towards some of the men.  He even gives out nicknames to some men for any reason like Cowboy (Arliss Howard), who is from Texas. And the one who is targeted the most by Hartman is Vincent D'Ofornio, whose character is dubbed 'Gomer Pyle'.  D'Ofornio's character is a bit on the pudgy side and struggles at just about everything except for sharpshooting.After he survives basic training, Joker is a member of 'Stars and Stripes', a militarized version of a magazine like 'TIME' or 'Newsweek'. Modine unleashes some gentle and colorful humor to superior officer here even though the John Wayne impersonations are lame.During one assignment in the city of Hue during the Tet Offensive, Joker and his partner, Rafterman (Kevin Major Howard), a photographer find the infantry unit that Cowboy is in and introduces themselves to the unit. Nearly all the members have unusual nicknames and my favorite one of the bunch is Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), who is the unit's wily gunner and the first meeting that he has with Joker is hilarious as the two swap questions and putdowns.This half is much better than the first as the unit patrol a part of the city which lies in ruins due to the severe fighting.  Kubrick gradually lets the suspense and fear build and it works wonderfully.  The best exhibit of that when Joker quietly confronts a sniper.The performances here are nice, but the best parts of the film is Abigail Mead's score, a mix of oldies and composed bits are great and Doug Milsome's cinematography is done to sheer genius.  'FULL METAL JACKET' may not be a great film, but one that's provoctive and serious.",7,0,0,15 August 2001
Predator," A superbly made hair-raising thriller.
","Surprisingly good mix of action and terror are shaken and stirred into one great science fiction/adventure movie.  The film takes place in the deep jungle of South America where a small elite team of heavily-armed American commandos sent on a mission to rescue hostages that are held by local rebels.  What the team nor its' confident leader (Schwarznegger) recognize is that they're being sought after is a wily yet meancing creature from outer space instead of a sniper.  The movie benefits not only from magnificent performances and directing of then-unknown John McTiernan, but the beautiful camera work of Donald McAlpine and the creature design by the legendary make-up master Stan Winston.  A superbly made hair-raising thriller.",9,0,0,13 July 2002
Notting Hill," A sweet and very likable romance treat.
","Fairly appealing love story about the lowly owner (Hugh Grant) of a London-based travel book store whose happiness has slowly withered away until a well-known movie star (Julia Roberts) comes in one day.  The pair are drawn to each other and that leads to a roller-coaster relationship. Roberts and Grant are both great to watch and so is Rhys Ifans, who colorfully portrays Grant's awkward roommate.  Despite that, the movie is somewhat overlong.  A sweet and very likable romance treat.",8,0,0,17 September 2001
American Pie," A film where the characters aren't degraded.
","Funny and a very lovable comedy where four guys: Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz (Chris Klein), and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) strike a deal that they'll try to let go of their virginities before the end of the school year.  Kudos to director Paul Weitz and screenwriter Adam Herz for creating a movie where the morals and humor aren't at the same depth.  The characters in this film here are easy to understand and no one misses a single beat.  One example would be Eugene Levy (who portrays Jim's Dad) manages to snag a few scenes and his character is interesting, too.",8,2,3,2 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An electrifying eye candy feast.
","A wonder to behold and not to be taken for granted, the first chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is an electrifying eye candy feast, courtsey of director Peter Jackson and writers.The story itself isn't too hard to understand as a hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a mysterious ring from a close relative, Bilbo (Ian Holm) and unfortunately finds out who it belonged to before. So Frodo is forced to take the ring back to where it came from and he's helped from a wide (and unlikely assortment) of allies who become known as 'the Fellowship'.Besides the story, another element of the movie made me enjoy even more is the cast, which has to be one of the best ones ever assembled in several decades. Among the other key characters are Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a wizard: two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) and Boromir (Sean Bean): Legolas (Orlando Bloom), a wise elf with excellent marksmanship: Gimili (John Rhys-Davies), an axe-wielding dwarf with a grudge: and three other hobbits (Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monhagan) who make up the 'Fellowship'. There's some other familiar faces that appear here (Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee) who each play a key role here.Overall, the movie is bound to be a classic even though it moves at a leisurely pace and gives the viewer time to understand the characters more especially Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn - each of whom seem to be bothered by something in their past.One last thing, since I haven't seen 'A Beautiful Mind' yet I'm sure this movie truly deserved 'Best Picture' and I say it not insult the die hard fans of the series.",10,1,1,10 February 2003
He Got Game," Simply magnificent.
","A smart nevertheless unforgettable tale of a prisoner (Denzel Washington), who is offered a chance to have his prison sentence reduced if he can persuade his estranged and bitter son (Ray Allen), a highly sought after college basketball recruit, to sign a letter of intent for the governor's favorite college in one week.  Writer-director Spike Lee dishes out a simply magnificent story of the never-ending (and outrageous) offers that the son has presented to him besides trying to confront his father.  The message that this movie is willing to make isn't forced, but only displayed in such unsettling detail.  Washington is fine and Allen himself holds his ground here fairly well.",9,0,1,19 January 2002
American Beauty," Fairly good, but very dark and disturbing
","I'm unsure if this film and Kevin Spacey were convincing enough to earn the two Oscars, but it did deserve one for the cinematography.  Spacey, Benning, and Chris Cooper give very solid performances.  The real performances come from Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari ('American Pie'), and Thora Birch, who altogether make this movie very powerful, startling, and moving in the right direction.",6,0,0,24 April 2000
Heartbreak Ridge," A sharp and 'very' witty film.
","Watching Clint Eastwood work his magic on the big screen is something for a movie lover like myself to treasure and in 'Heartbreak Ridge', Eastwood really unleashes it here.Eastwood stars (and directed) the film as Thomas 'Gunny' Highway, a very seasoned and highly decorated, but a troublesome U.S. Marine gunnery sergeant. Highway begins what may be his last tour of duty and along the way, he deals with a rowdy and undisciplined bunch of recruits (Mario Van Peebles being the most sarcastic and cocky one among the bunch) and turns them into reliable soldiers, Major Powers (Everett McGill), a higher-ranking officer who totally dislikes Highway, and tries to revive his relationship with Aggie (Marsha Mason), his ex-wife who isn't afraid to tell him about the misery that she has suffered.The film runs at a brisk pace and Eastwood saves the best scenes for last when he guides the squad into Grenada to find a medical school where the students (mostly Americans) are held captive and the shootouts are well-done. Plus, the humor in this film is sharp and very witty although some of it may be offensive.'Heartbreak Ridge' does remind me of the one film that I've seen made by the late Samuel Fuller - 'The Big Red One'. There are a few differences that seem notable, but both films bear a strong resemblance and appeal.",8,42,63,15 May 2001
Apocalypse Now," Truly unforgettable
","Francis Ford Coppola has made 'Apocalypse Now' a truly unforgettable film about the war in Vietnam.  The cinematography is sensational and so is the acting.  Martin Sheen is terrific as Willard, the agent who is sent by the Army to take out an out of control Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando who gives one of the memorable performances in his career.  Robert Duvall is superb as the wild surfing fanatic/Air Calvary leader Kilgore who says a few famous quotes after a helicopter attack on a small village that's held by the Viet Cong.  Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, and Larry Fishburne have some solid moments as the members of PT crew that take Willard in Cambodia.  It takes a while before the boat meets its destination where we find Kurtz's camp and surprise, an American pot smoking photojournalist is there to greet the surviving members of the PT crew and Willard.  The photojournalist is wonderfully played by Dennis Hopper who is also there like Willard to find out more about Kurtz.  Then Kurtz (Brando) himself enters the picture in a way that no one could have ever thought of at the time.  It does get bogged before I see what happens to Kurtz and it doesn't look pretty.  Overall, 'Apocalyspe Now' is a masterpiece that should be treasured by anyone who sees the movie.",10,0,0,6 April 2000
The Patriot," Emmerich's best film to this date.
","Director Roland Emmerich redeems himself in directing 'The Patriot', a glorious yet extremely take on the Revolutionary War and how a former war hero, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) gets dragged into the war when his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) enlists in the Continental Army and one of his other sons, is shot and killed by a cold-blooded British colonel, Tavington (Jason Issacs), whose harsh tactics are heavily despised by Cornwallis (Ton Wilkinson) himself.  This movie shows very clearly why the war took a physical and personal toll on some people and Gibson's character makes the best example.  Also, Robert Rodat writes a solid script, the score by John Williams is fresh and moving, and Caleb Deschanel's priceless cinematography is breath-taking. Overall, this film is Emmerich's best one to this date.",9,0,1,2 May 2001
Dark City," This is science fiction at its' best.
","This is science fiction at its' best and Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' shows why.  'Dark City' is the fantastic and memorable fable about John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), a man who remembers very little of his past, is targeted by the police for a series of brutal murders and he is also a target of the Strangers, in which a few members of the alien race that want Murdoch dead simply because he has their powers.Besides the cast (Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, Ian Richardson, Colin Friels, and Richard O'Brien) whose performances is definitely first-rate, Director Proyas and his screenwriters (Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer) create a marvelous story, but the stars of the film are the production designers (George Liddle, Patrick Tatopoulos), the composer (Trevor Jones), the photographer (Dariusz Wolski), and the head(s) of the art direction (Richard Hobbs, Michelle McGahney).",10,0,1,9 April 2001
Cross of Iron," Solid yet rough around the edges war epic.
","Solid yet rough around the edges war epic (the only war movie that Sam Peckinpah made) that closely examins a soldier's ability to deal with life, death, and other issues while fighting on the front lines in any war.In the movie, a bitter and war weary German staff sergeant, Rolf Steiner (the late James Coburn) is forced to deal with another dilemma besides trying to keep the moral of his recon unit up instead of down on the Eastern Front.  The dilemma being is his new superior officer, Captain Stransky (Maxmillian Schell), who is a Prussian and is determined to get what Steiner already has - The Iron Cross (the highest military award that a German soldier can earn for those who don't know) at any cost.The film is marvelous although it has some areas where it's weak yet the harsh battle scenes depicted here would give another WWII movie a run for its' money.  Coburn and Schell are good here and so are the supporting performances turned in by James Mason and David Warner who both portray high-ranking German officers.  Plus, the camera work of John Coquillion and Ernest Gold's musical score does make the movie much more effective.",8,0,0,6 August 2003
Aliens," Has everything that you would want in a superior sequel.
","Dynamite follow-up to the original as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the lone survivor returns to deal with the aliens when she's persuaded to assist a heavily-armed unit of Colonial Marines to the same planet to restore contact with a small colony.Michael Biehn, Lance Henrikson, and Bill Paxton are among the Marines who come for the mission as does Paul Reiser, who plays a dishonest company executive.  When the Marines and Ripley land on the planet, they find only one survivor, Newt (Carrie Henn), who avoided being seen by the creatures.
Unlike the first one, 'Aliens' is almost an science fiction/adventure, thanks in part to director James Cameron who became well-known for making 'The Terminator' a few years back.  Cameron co-wrote the story with David Giler and Walter Hill and in return, the story feels developed all-around with some bizarre jokes along side the hair-raising action sequences.  The best one of which, is the showdown between Ripley and the queen alien, which leaves the viewer rooting for Ripley.'Aliens' has everything that you would want in a superior sequel (laughs, thrills, etc.)  Maybe the best one of the series.",9,0,2,25 September 2002
The Usual Suspects," Amazing from beginning to end.
","In 'The Usual Suspects', Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Kint (Kevin Spacey) are arrested for a crime that one of them may have committed and put in a police line-up.  A few weeks later, there's bloody shootout in the Long Beach harbor and Kint is one of the few survivors of what happened that night.  One customs agent, Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) is determined to find out what Kint didn't tell the D.A..  The conversation between Kint and Kujan is long and has a plenty of flashbacks.  The performances in this movie are played to complete perfection.  A few examples would be Spacey's that earned him a Best Supporting Oscar, Byrne and Palminteri, who should have earned at least a Best Actor nomination, and Pete Postlewaite is good as the middle man Koyabashi and maybe Keyser Soze.  John Ottman's spellbinding musical score, Newton Thomas Siegel's artistic cinematography, and Howard Cummings's colorful production design set the perfect tone.  The ending is a little bit questionable, but it's still good in a way.",9,0,1,29 July 2000
The Dirty Dozen," An absolute masterpiece!
","A great movie that's filled with explosive action and weird humor about a stubborn Army Major John Reisman (Lee Marvin) is ordered by two generals (Ernest Borgnine and Robert Webber) to train twelve G.I. felons who are sentenced to long terms of imprisonment or be hanged, into commandos for a raid on a château in France where the German army's chain of command is at. Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, John Cassavettes, Donald Sutherland, and Telly Salvalas are among the twelve felons. The performances in this movie are great all around, most notably Marvin, Bronson, and Cassavettes. Sutherland has a couple of great one-liners. During the battle, Brown has a great death scene. Based on E. M Nathanson's novel and is the screenplay by Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller is great. Frank De Vol's compelling musical score sets a very solid tone and tension. Besides Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line', Robert Aldrich's 'The Dirty Dozen' is the other WWII film that I enjoy. It's an absolute masterpiece.",9,2,6,28 August 2000
Tigerland," Redefines the 'anti-war' movie.
","Fierce and immaginative tale of survival as a group of Army recruits (in basic training) endure the demanding (and degrading) instruction of their drill sergeants before entering the last part of training - an area known as 'Tigerland', which is a simulation version of Vietnam.  Director Joel Schumacher used a hand held camera to film the movie and how he handles the direction is terrific.  Colin Farrell is sensational here and he fits the mold of Mel Gibson ('Lethal Weapon') and John Cassavetes ('The Dirty Dozen').  Matthew Davis, who was one of the bright spots in 'Urban Legends:Final Cut', delivers another fine performance.  Matthew Libatique's eye-catching photography and Nathan Larson's glistening score also caught my attention right away.  'Tigerland' redefines the 'anti-war' movie.",10,0,0,26 September 2001
The Pianist," Roman Polanski is back in true form.
","If there was one person who survived the Holocaust and several years later, he/she was willing enough to bring their tale of survival to the big screen. Director Roman Polanski ('Chinatown', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Tess') may be one of those brave individuals who might fit the billing and in his latest film - 'The Pianist' couldn't have come out in dangerous times like now.The story is based on the life (and memoir) of the late Wladyslaw Spzilman, who lived with his parents and siblings in Warsaw, Poland in 1939, the year that Nazi Germany started to make their horrifying invasion of their unsuspecting European neighbors. Wladyslaw makes his living as a pianist and is performing for a Polish radio when he's interrupted by bomb blasts. For that point, Spzilman and the other Jews who lived in Europe at the time that German onslaught began, their lives would never be the same again. By telling Spzilman's story here, Polanski finally gets the chance to tell his own story as well.Adrien Brody, who recently won the Best Actor Oscar for his mesmerizing and unforgettable portrayal of the musician is flat out incredible. Brody plays his character like you wouldn't expect in any Polanski movie yet you're left wondering how does Wladyslaw manage to avoid being caught by the SS or death itself? If I were like the main character here, trying to survive in an occupied city and stay out of sight isn't only impossible, but a true testament of the human heart.The best scene in 'The Pianist' are saved for the second half of the movie. Since Spzilman has been separated from his family and has been living on the lam with some help from unlikely sources. One of them is a sympatheic German captain, Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretchmann), who is kind enough to let Wladyslaw play the piano and Hosenfeld returns the favor by giving what appeared to be German chocolate and a loaf of bread. While Spzilman isn't only performing in front of the captain, he's also entertaining the other German soldiers to think about besides being chased by the Red Army.Once I left the theater in Madison where I saw the film, it made me think twice before even looking at a piano again. Plus, 'The Pianist' is one of those rare movies that wants the viewer to feel satisfied and look at life itself instead taking it for granted. I can't finish this review by applauding the Academy's decision not only to give Brody an Oscar, but to Polanski (Best Director) and screenwriter Ronald Harwood (Best Screenplay from another material) yet it didn't earn the Best Picture award sad to say. This movie when it comes out on video and DVD should serve as a wise choice for educating students of any level either in history or music.",10,0,1,29 March 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A movie-goer's dream come true.
","Wow! Ang Lee's latest film, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a martial arts masterpiece that certainly has punch and kick added to it. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh, who both are very athletic veterans of the genre, head the all-Asian cast in this film. I don't know a great deal about the old kung fu films, but when I watched it in the movie theater (twice). I felt like I had learned something yet I can't put my finger on it.The film's story follows the furious pursuit of a legendary sword (The Green Destiny) that has been stolen and how two warriors (Fat and Yeoh) reunite to find the suspect(s) who are involved in the theft. But that's only one of the movie's two main subplots and the other one consists of a bearucrat's daughter (Ziyi Zhang) and a notorious bandit (Chen Chang) who fall in love.Besides the story, the musical score that's masterfully composed by Tan Dun, the breath-taking cinematography by Peter Pau, and the film's harrowing fight scenes also stand out here. Out of all the fight scenarios, the one that breaks out in the restaurant is my pick.'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a movie-goer's dream come true and should have earned BEST PICTURE at the Oscars.",10,0,0,22 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up.
","The well-awaited sequel to the original has come and doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up. 'The Two Towers' picks up where 'The Fellowship' left off and the second chapter hardly miss a walloping beat.Most of the cast returns here with the additions of Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, and a very slimy Brad Dourif who appear here.The remaining members of 'The Fellowship' have taken different paths since the first one ended and the encounters here are even more hair-raising. Frodo and Sam are heading to Mordor with assistance of the (psychologically and physically warped) creature Gollum while Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas are searching for Merry and Pippin, who were abducted and wind up running into a few surprises - one being Gandalf, who appears here as 'Gandalf the White' instead of Grey and the other is what happened in Rohan.There's even one subplot where Aragorn (Mortenson) himself is now attracted to a king's daughter (Otto) while he still has the affection for Arwen (Liv Tyler). In a lesser movie, it might be a distraction, but here, it's not.Like the original, the battle scenes are frightening especially of the last ones that takes a half an hour. That fierce battle reminded of a quote from 'Platoon' where a soldier says 'The beast is out there and he's hungry tonight.' and to me, the fight is like 'Platoon' with swords and axes instead of guns and gernades.'The Two Towers' is strong all-around as the first one was, but since it's the middle chapter. The energy isn't as high here, however; it makes up with the intensity. And maybe this time, the movie might get 'Best Picture' at the Oscars.",10,0,0,10 February 2003
The Elephant Man," A personal victory for anyone who has a disability of any kind.
","Terribly sad nevertheless poignant true story of John Merrick (John Hurt), an Englishman who was dubbed 'The Elephant Man' because he had Proteus Syndrome, a rare yet series disorder, and how he found help from Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a deeply sympathetic London doctor who took Merrick from the degrading control of a mean-spirited freak show owner (Freddie Jones) and showed him to be happy for once in his life. Director David Lynch ('The Straight Story') lets the actors gently embrace their parts with a great deal of respect. Also notable is the camera work by Freddie Francis, which is masterfully shot the old-fashioned way in black and white and the handling of the make-up on the Hurt character. At certain parts of the movie, I was almost shedding tears. 'The Elephant Man' is both a treasure and a personal victory for anyone who has a disability of any kind.",10,0,0,24 September 2001
Slap Shot," It's 'The Dirty Dozen' on ice and scores.
","In desperate need of talent and larger crowds, the player-coach of a struggling minor league hockey team, Reggie Dunlap (Paul Newman) suggests to his players to pick fights or hit on the opposition instead of scoring goals.  The players who carry out Dunlap's message are the three Hanson brothers and they also become the heart and soul of the squad.  And the result isn't nasty as the original 'Rollerball', but it sure produces plenty of shockingly funny moments that range from what the Newman character says to the antics that the Hansons resort to on and off the rink.  Even Strother Martin and Michael Ontkean have their turns in providing a laugh or too during the movie.  It's 'The Dirty Dozen' on ice and scores.",10,0,2,17 June 2002
Kelly's Heroes," Strange, but satisfying war comedy.
","Strange, but satisfying war comedy that takes place in France near the end of WWII.  The tale follows Kelly (Clint Eastwood), a former lieutenant who's been demoted to private for a particular mishap finds an opportunity to redeem himself.  He gets a German intelligence officer drunk, then makes him confess that theres fourteen thousand gold bars in a bank held behind enemy lines.Second, Kelly persuades Crapgame (Don Rickles), a shifty arms dealer, Oddball (Donald Sutherland), a hippie who commands three Sherman tanks, and his fussy superior officer, Master Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) and his men to come along for the three-day trip.  Big Joe is reluctant at first, to go along with Kelly, but he eventually buys the idea and lets Kelly himself be in charge.There are plenty of gentle humor and the same can be mentioned for the shootouts, which are wonderfully staged and there's hardly any blood being shed.  Plus, take a good look at the tanks that Oddball commands, each one has a loudspeaker and another cannon, which is smaller and fires paint to scare away a Tiger or Panzer tank.  Oddball tells Kelly that he only plays 'loud music' and his main selection is country.  I highly agree on Oddball's selection.I'll give credit to Brian G. Hutton, the director and his screenwriter, Troy Kennedy Martin, let the movie go at a gentle pace and give anybody who's in on the deal, make their presence felt.  Also, whenever I looked at  the Sutherland character (Oddball) for a minute, I see the year that the film was released in, which is 1970.  1970 is the year of where America was up to its' neck in the Vietnam War.  Lalo Schifrin (TV's Mission Impossible) conducts an excellent score and the songs are great to listen to.In conclusion, the movie is a delightful romp even though the final showdown is a letdown, but I won't throw it away.  Eastwood is solid as he usual is in delivering a good performance.  Savalas and Rickles are fine here as is the rest of the supporting cast, which includes Stuart Margolin, Perry Lopez, and Harry Dean Stanton. Sutherland, well, the film wouldn't be as good without him being around.  He's basically the film's highlight and quietly snatches any scene that he's in.",9,2,3,10 September 2001
The Evil Dead," A first-rate shocker.
","I'm not a huge fan of messy horror flicks, but when I watched Sam Raimi's bloody thriller, 'The Evil Dead'.  I wondered if I was being too harsh on the film although I did like the sequel to 'Urban Legend', Wes Craven's 'Scream', and David Cronenberg's 'Videodrome'.  The three films had one thing in common - they were very graphic.  The film takes place in the backwoods of Tennessee where a few Michigan State students drive up to a wooden cabin to spend a few days there.  Soon the students discover that they aren't alone when some demons called 'Shemps' come after them.  The Shemps don't go down without a fight and take a severe beating (more severe than Stallone took in the 'Rocky' films and Walken took in 'The Dogs of War').  Although the violence is very graphic, I wasn't bothered by it and part of that comes from the excellent camera work.  The film made stars of director Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who plays the heroic Ash.  'The Evil Dead' is a first-rate shocker.",9,0,1,20 June 2001
The Insider," A very slick, smart, and absolutely shocking film.
","'The Insider' is like the 'All The President's Men', 'The Hurriance', and any other true story that involves dirty tactics.  The true story revolves around Lowell Bergmann (Al Pacino), a segment producer for the CBS news show, '60 Minutes' and Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former sciencetist who used to work for Brown & Williamson.  Bergmann wants Wigand to go on '60 Minutes' and tell Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) the little secrets that the seven C.E.O.s, a.k.a 'The Seven Dwarfs' didn't tell Congress.  Wallace and Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall) oppose Bergmann's idea to air the segment because Big Tobacco might sue CBS. Russell Crowe is simply superb here as he was in 'L.A. Confidential' and earned an Oscar nomination for it.  Al Pacino, too, is fantastic and he deserved the Best Supporting Oscar hands down.  Dante Spinotti's cinematography is spectacular as is the musical score.  Director Michael Mann has made some classics in the past ('HEAT', 'Manhunter').  Add 'The Insider' to that list.",10,0,0,31 July 2000
Major League," Downright irriestiable.
","Amusing and fun-filled baseball comedy about some players of the Cleveland Indians who band together to make a serious run for the play-offs when they hear that their new owner has plans to move the team to Florida.Writer/director David S. Ward ('Down Periscope') has served up a charming and in-genius treat for anyone who still love the game of baseball despite what has happened to the game in recent years.  The cast that Ward has assembled here (Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Wesley Snipes, Rene Russo, etc.) is marvelous.  In addition, two notable former big leaguers (Pete Vukovich and Bob Uecker) also appear in the movie.There are plenty of nice touches applied here, such as having the old County Stadium (home of the Brewers) and some of Uecker's punch-lines make the film downright irriestiable.",9,5,13,27 November 2002
The Graduate," A monumental and cinematic disaster.
","A monumental and cinematic disaster - I'm refering to Mike Nichols' so-called classic comedy 'THE GRADUATE', which left me in a state of disbelief.  The film marks the first major film for Dustin Hoffman, who horribly portrays a uncertain college graduate who gets himself caught up in tug-of-war between his girlfriend (Katherine Ross) whom he loves than her seductive mother (Anne Brancroft) who doesn't sound very convincing - at all.  Besides that, I can't understand why this is a comedy and it degrades people.  If there was someone that I felt sorry for is Ross and not Hoffman. Not even the Simon & Garfunkel songs and Dave Grusin's musical score couldn't make me enjoy this wreck.",1,22,50,4 September 2001
Chariots of Fire," A key testment of the human spirit.
","Fresh, almost easy-going drama that looks at two men from Great Britian, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), both of whom decide to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics, that's in Paris.  What makes these two lads different is what each one is motivated by, which surprised me.  And one has certainly to ask why the athletes in this time appear to be so calm and hardly panic.Cross and Charleson are supported by a well-choosen cast that includes a few familiar faces - the late John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm. The one who plays a crucial role is Holm, who portrays Sam Mussabini, a seasoned veteran coach who helps Harold (Cross) prepare for the track and field events.And the characters in this story make a portion of the movie somewhat interesting.  The musical score by Vangelis, which sounds clear and doesn't goes for over-the-top, is still priceless.  Besides the score, director Hugh Hudson's careful direction adds another element and makes the film even more appealing.  'Chariots of Fire' is a key testment of the human spirit.",8,2,3,27 March 2002
The Hurricane," A true epic that is for real and is a must see for everyone.
","The beginning of Norman Jewison's latest film, 'The Hurricane' doesn't start out the normal way that most true stories that involve a crime take. The flashbacks between the past and present of an ex-prize fighter Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter (Denzel Washington) is nice touch.  This movie was based on Carter's novel 'The Sixteeninth Round' and another novel (the name I forget).  Carter is serving a life sentence in a New Jersey prison for the murders that he never committed.  Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya - Shaft) is the bitterly crooked cop that framed and has an obbsession of Carter since the man was a young child.  Despite many appeals for a new trial have failed, Carter's last chance for freedom comes in the form of a young black boy (V. Reon Shannon) and his three Canadian friends (Deborah Kara Unger, John Hannah, and Liev Schrieber).  The trio and Carter search through the information of the murders for key clues.  The events leading up to the hearing are very emotional and powerful.  Christopher Young's musical score adds a key part to that and so does the film's story.  Washington is sensational in his role that earned him a Golden Globe for Best Actor and an Oscar nomination.  Hedaya gives a solid performance as does Clancy Brown, who is one of the few people that Carter befriends in prison.  'The Hurriance' is a true epic that is for real and is a must see for everyone.",9,0,2,24 July 2000
Where Eagles Dare," Crisp and very, very clever adventure
","Crisp and very, very clever adventure based on a Alistar MacLean novel (and scripted by the author himself) where a commando unit consisting of mostly Brits and one American who are sent to the Alps to rescue an American general who is held captive in a castle that's swarming with Germans.The movie is loaded with surprises most of which keep the viewer constantly guessing and the fireworks don't go over the top. Burton and Eastwood are both fun to watch here and like the two leads, the camera work is outstanding, and the direction by Brian Hutton doesn't over play his hand. Another thing, MacLean's script is so good in handling the details, characters, and so forth that Stephen King himself should be taking notes.",9,7,8,21 August 2006

The doctor falls right into a sexual odessey of his own and never looks back.  Out of the Stanley Kubrick films that I've seen ('THE SHINING', 'FULL METAL JACKET'), 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a gem.  The musical score and cinematography is great, so is the acting.  Director/Actor Sydney Pollack, Thomas Gibson, Leelee Sobeleski, and Rade Shadegerbia add nice supporting performances.

Hoosiers," Delightfully entertaining.
","Magnificent sports tale about a former college coach, Norman Dale (Gene Hackman)who's given a chance to redeem himself by coaching a boys' high school basketball team in a rural Indiana town.Director David Anspaugh and his screen-writer, Angelo Pizzo, don't go for over-the-top in providing the numerous issues that Dale deals with constantly. Some of those issues play a pivotal role in the movie such as Dale hiring Shooter (Dennis Hopper), a former basketball star who's now confined to being the town drunk and father to one of the players. Another one being that Dale has only eight, not twelve team members, which includes the equipment manager (no pun intended).As for the games, the tension is so real that you could feel like that you're there, watching the game unfold so quickly. Plus, I couldn't help to admit that it was certainly heart-pounding, without a doubt. The movie's photography, shot by Fred Murphy ('October Sky') with such excellent skill, makes the appearance of each gym and even the landscape takes your breath away. Also, the musical score, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, is definitely authentic and I'm left wondering why it's not available on CD.'Hoosiers' is like the 'Rocky' of basketball in a certain way, but by looking at these underdogs for a moment. Hackman and Hopper are both excellent here as the sports' version of 'The Odd Couple'. It immediately reminded me of the boys' prep teams in Wisconsin, not in Indiana.Delightfully entertaining.",10,0,0,21 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Impressive.
","Impressive adaptation of the first Harry Potter novel as the boy himself is surprised to what he inherited from his deceased parents and heads off to the Hogwarts school to solve the mystery and who was responsible.Director Chris Columbus deserves a lot of credit for keeping the movie itself belivable yet creative.  The three young leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) are pretty good here just as the supporting cast, consisting of mostly well-known British actors and actresses.I don't mean to offend any of the die hard fans of the series by saying this, but this movie didn't deliver the same punch veilocity as 'The Lord of the Rings' did.",9,0,0,26 May 2003
The Untouchables," Nearly made to perfection and De Palma at his finest.
","Updated version of the old tv series and based on the novel by Oscar Fraley, 'The Untouchables' is fresh, smart, and 'extremely' tense.  The film's story follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner in his best role and perfermance), a Treasury officer who is sent from D.C. to Chicago during Prohibition to enforce the law and discovers after a raid that there's corruption in the city's police force.  Ness begins the crackdown when he enlists the aid of three men: Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a Irish cop, a very raw and curious police recruit named George Stone (Andy Garcia), and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant who Ness meets in his office. In that scene, Wallace tells Ness that one of the city's most notorious mobsters, Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro in an amusing yet in wicked fashion) has committed tax evasion.  Besides that scene and the one where Ness and Malone are together in the church, the film never shows any serious signs of letting down.  De Palma, who is also known for directing the classic bloodfest known as 'Carrie', wisefully mixes in the sequences that either have action or Hitchcock-like suspense and squeezes in the ethinc conflict (Italians and Irish).  Besides that, two lesser known actors, Billy Drago and Richard Bradford are good here as Capone's swift and vicious enforcer Frank Nitti and the police chief who tries to convince Malone to stay out of the battle between Ness and Capone.  Screenwriter and Pulitzer-prize winner David Mamet wrote the maverlous script, Ennio Morricone conducts a priceless score, and Stephen H. Burum shows magnificant camera work.  The movie is nearly made to perfection and shows De palma at his finest.",9,0,0,8 March 2001
Mystic River," Plays like a serious reality check.

The performances here are terrific - especially Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, both of whom have a very good chance of earning Oscar nominations. Also, the direction that director Clint Eastwood (who also handled the musical score) takes the movie in leaves you with second thoughts about what happens in the story.  Overall, 'Mystic River' makes you think about the decisions that people make in life and how they have to live with it. This movie plays like a serious reality check and has to be one of the best films this year.",10,2,4,1 January 2004
Enemy at the Gates," An extrordinary work of raw skill and imagination.
","A gut-wrenching and impressive hide-and-seek thriller that uses the bloody battle of Stalingrad (during the second World War) as the clever disguise here for a real battle of courage and determination.  The film follows a young and highly talented Russian sniper from the Urals, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law - 'eXistenZ', 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'), who gains national fame from the help of Danilov (Joesph Fiennes - 'Shakespeare in Love'), a propoganda officer and his true love and fellow sniper, Tania (Rachael Weisz), who is also flirting with Danilov.However, the Germans have an ace sniper of their own in Erwin Koning (Ed Harris - 'Pollock'), a seasoned and out-spoken Major who comes to Stalingrad only to pick off Vassili.  And before Koning leaves, his superior officer asks how he'll find Vassili.  Koning says, ' I'll fix it so he finds me.'The love triangle that director Jean-Jacques Annaud and co-writer Alain Godard put in the story shows that the pair took a chance and I'll give them credit for doing it.  Plus, the love scene that Law and Weisz have is one of the strangest (no offense to either one) that I've seen.The film's best moments come when Vassili tries to catch Koning off guard, but the problem is Koning is aware of what Vassili is capable of.   I won't say how it's done, but the final confrontation is a genuine nail-bitter.All of the performances here are powerhouse and that includes Bob Hoskins as Nikita Kruschev, a snarling and impatient man and Ron Perlman, who portrays Koulikov, a lieutenant whose teeth are all metal and serves as a guide for Vassili.Robert Frassie ('Ronin') handles the movie's photography with care and the appearrence of Stalingrad itself reminded me heavily of the war-torn cities shown in Spielsburg's 'Saving Private Ryan' and Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'.  Also, James Horner conducts a tender and extremely mournful score that leaves a quiet yet important reminder of how awful war is.'ENEMY AT THE GATES' is an extrodinary work of raw skill and imagination.",10,137,233,21 August 2001
The Bridge on the River Kwai," An absolute and exhilarating piece of a movie epic.
","I have trouble just trying to describe David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' in less than five words to summerise my review.  However, I'll say it's an absolute and exhilarating piece of a movie epic.Based on the novel by Pierre Boule, a band of British P.O.W.s who are under the command of the unbreakable Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) construct a bridge (for trains) for their Japanese captors before a specific date.  What Nicholson and the Japanese don't know that the lone American war prisoner, Shears (William Holden), who is presumed dead after making a daring escape and is now guiding Warden (Jack Hawkins), a British major and his small commando unit whose objective is to the blow up the bridge. Although I loved the film's dynamic climax, I also liked the psychological battle of wills that Nicholson and Saito (Sessue Hawkaya), the camp's leader have.  James Donald, who portrays Major Clipton, the medical officer, says that unforgettable line at the end - ' Madness...Madness'The performances here are definitely memorable ones, Guinness and Holden most notably.  I can't forget to mention the film's lavish photography (Jack Hildyard) of the jungle and Malcolm Arnold's clever musical score which includes the famous whistling WWI song 'The Colonel Bogey March'.  There's a strange fact that since the movie's two screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, were 'blacklisted'.  Boule, who didn't speak a word in English, received credit for the script.",10,2,4,12 July 2001
The Green Mile," A sincere and honest film.
","Would it be unfair of me to think of 'The Green Mile' as the film that brought back the issue of capital punishment?Yes, that I would admit, but the film itself is one that can provoke plenty of thoughts.The film was written and directed by Frank Darabont, who is best known for adapting one of the short stories from Stephen King's 'Different Seasons', 'The Shawnshank Redemption'.The story involves an elderly man, Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) who recalls one year while he (Tom Hanks) was in charge of the Death Row 'E' block at a prison in Louisana during the Great Depression and met John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a tall prisoner who changed Edgecomb's life.If there's one part of the film that left me unsatisfied and that would be the film's length.  In this case, the movie is nearly three hours.  Despite that, some of the executions are difficult to handle and in one particular scene, one of the prisoners is burned to a crisp.However, the film has a great cast and is certainly well acted, most notably Hanks and Duncan, who is great to watch and listen.",8,0,1,6 February 2001
Jaws," An excellent piece of pure movie entertainment.
","A smart and carefully crafted thriller, based on the novel by Peter Benchley, when a vicious great white shark is suspected of attacking swimmers near a small, quiet sea-side community.  The down-to-earth chief of police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a keen oceanographer, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and a scruffy yet Captain Ahab-like fisherman, Quint (the late Robert Shaw) set out in Quint's untidy boat to find and kill the beast before it strikes again.Steven Spielburg, who directed the movie, does a brilliant in taking a tale like this and creating a real stomach-churning, mind-numbing adventure. Plus, Spielburg, the three leads (Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss), and the screen-writers deserve a great deal of credit for their parts.  I can't forget to mention the priceless score that's done by John Williams and Bill Butler's colorful camera work.What made me enjoy the movie is that Spielburg uses fear instead of gore to scare the viewer and make him/her feel like anyone who goes to that beach.  Even the dialogue has its' share of good one-liners and the harrowing speech delivered by Quint (Shaw) about the sinking of the Indianapolis and the problems that he and the crew members encounter.  He covers just about every detail that you can think about those who made it out alive and those who didn't survive.In conclusion, 'Jaws' is an excellent piece of pure movie entertainment. As for Spielburg, the film made him a genius.",9,1,3,18 June 2002
Platoon," Flat-out harrowing and very unsincere.
","Flat-out harrowing and very unsincere war epic, director Oliver Stone used his own experience in the battle to create this movie and I really admire for doing just that.  What I also admire in the film is the first-rate cast, headed by Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willem Dafoe.The film is seen and told through the eyes of Chris (Sheen), a college dropout who enters the Airborne Division and ultimately gets more than he bargained for.Chris becomes a close friend to the patron saint-like SGT. Elias (Dafoe), while he despises the scar-faced and bitter Barnes (Berenger), the other SGT. who is a higher ranking officer in the company.  The hatred and disrespect that Barnes and Elias show toward each other eventually consumes everybody in both units.Stone is very smart in setting up most of the shootouts and he does it so where any G.I. goes to for cover, they're always in danger of being hit by anything (enemy or friendly fire, a mortar or long-range shell).  To survive a single battle in this war without being shot or witnessing some god-awful sight like seeing a friend dying was very common.  That I can understand.The performances given here are than memorable, it leaves an everlasting (and paralyzing) effect on one.  One example would seeing the reaction on Chris's face when he notices that Elias is still on the ground and being shot at by several V.C..What Oliver Stone has made here is a classic and I was satisfied although Dafoe didn't get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar is a real mystery.",9,1,2,10 July 2001

","Swift and surprisingly intelligent nerve-tingling thriller (made by John Carpenter) about a grown-up murderer, Michael Myers, who as a young boy, killed his older sister on Halloween. Fifteen years later, Myers makes a daring escape from an Illinois mental hospital to return to his hometown, just to find his 'other sister', and start where he left off.The sister, Laurie, is played here by Jamie Lee Curtis and she is excellent despite screaming her head off upteen times. As Michael tails Laurie and her pals around town, Michael's eccentric doctor, Loomis (the late Donald Pleasence) comes to town to thwart Michael's attempt. Carpenter also composed the wondefully eerie musical score and Dean Cundey's camera work is terrific.",10,0,0,10 October 2001
Any Given Sunday," Not all sports movies that are made in the future should be done like this.
","Extremely sharp and intense film about the miniature and major dilemmas that a weary and devoted pro football coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) has to deal with during the regular season.  The team's new owner (Cameron Diaz) is unsure if Tony can lead the team to the playoffs.  Part of that conflict includes the team's two quarterbacks: Jack Rooney (Dennis Quaid) is an old, but a reliable veteran QB.  On the other hand, Willie Beamon (Jamie Foxx), is young and even though he becomes an overnight sensation.  Beamon makes the dreadful mistake of not keeping his cool and gets himself into a bitter conflict with the team's merc like running back (L.L. Cool J).  And just to make the film even interesting, the team's two doctors (James Woods as the unreliable one and Matthew Modine as the one who does it by the book) adds another piece of conflict.  Outside the team, John C. McGingly is good as the sarcastic football analyst/nutcase Jack Rose who constantly rips on D'Amato.'Any Given Sunday' doesn't seem to be predictable, but it's not although there's a wave of pressure in trying to be successful.  The film has several current or former NFL players and coaches in key roles like Lawrence Taylor as a veteran linebacker and Jim Brown as the defensive cordinator and in brief ones like Barry Switzer, Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus, and so forth.Director Oliver Stone is smart in making films with a lot of conflict and mistrust like this one and 'Platoon' is another example, but a lot better. There's one thing that I should note:  Not all sports movies that are made in the future should be done like this.",8,0,0,15 February 2001
Blade Runner," Solid and near perfect science fiction thriller.
","Solid and near perfect science fiction thriller of a Philip K. Dick novel where a physically (and emotionally) worn-out former L.A. cop/blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is ordered by his superior officer to find four androids who may be in the city and 'retire them'.What makes the movie (that's directed by Ridley Scott) work so effectively is the set direction and the view of Los Angeles in 2019 and that's just one of the few standouts here, the other two being Vangelis's smooth and haunting musical score and the superb and chilling performance from Rutger Hauer and Sean Young who does the opposite.The lone problem that I have with 'Blade Runner' is the script which isn't completely sharp and clever as the scenery is, but despite that flaw, I still enjoyed the movie.",8,1,2,18 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A fitting end to a great trilogy.
","The last installment in the LOTR trilogy finally is here and it didn't let me down one bit.  Out of the three movies in the series, 'The Return of The King' provides a lot of entertainment and excitement for three and a half hours (not to mention worth the price of admission).",10,0,1,12 February 2004
The Thin Red Line," War films should be made like Malick's 'The Thin Red Line'.
","Based on James Jones' novel, director Terrence Malick comes out to direct his first film in two decades.  And he hasn't lost a bit of skill in that long absence.  This movie is very poetic and show more than Oliver Stone's 'Platoon', Samuel Fuller's 'The Big Red One', and Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' did.  The characters, Hans Zimmer's music, and John Toll's cinematography make this film one to cherish.   There are strong performances given from Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Jim Cazeviel, Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin, John Savage, and so on.   Nolte, Penn, Chaplin and Cazeviel stand out as the best.  In my opinion, if 'Shakespeare In Love' didn't win BEST PICTURE, this movie should have.  Toll and Zimmer deserved Oscars for their efforts.  Forget 'Private Ryan', rent or buy 'The Thin Red Line'.",9,0,0,21 June 2000
The Great Escape," Is definitely a great adventure, hands down.
","Inspired by a true story and based on Paul Brickhill's novel, John Sturges' 'The Great Escape' is a great adventure, hands down.  The tale begins as a mass of Allied P.O.W.s (hauled in trucks) arrive at a new camp that's run by the Germans and is solely described as 'escape-proof'.  It doesn't take long for one prisoner, Virgil Hilts (the late Steve McQueen), who earns the nickname 'The Cooler King' for his failed escape attempts. Hilts isn't the only prisoner who wants out, a few others hatch a plan to get 250 men out in one night.  How its executed is a stroke of pure genius and skill.  The movie has a vast variety of characters who are allowed to show their feelings, which is a nice touch.  There two characters who make solid examples and I cared for the most.  One is Colin Blythe (the late Donald Pleasence), a gentle Brit who specializes in forging names and goes blind.  The other one in Danny Willinski (Charles Bronson), a Russian who excells in digging tunnels and tends to get rattled.  The performances here are just perfect and the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best ones that I've heard.  This movie would serve as a great history lesson for any student (middle or high).",10,2,4,6 August 2001
Sin City," Encore! Encore! Encore!
","Absolutely stunning and extremely hard hitting urban thriller based upon three Frank Miller graphic novels and in return, you get 'Sin City' (Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino share the directing duties) and the title itself doesn't lie.Three tales take place throughout the film, each one is excellent, very creative, the visuals are the icing on the cake, and considering which yarn stands out in my view, the one involving Marv (Mickey Rourke in his best role in years), a vengeful loner who sets to find out who was responsible for killing Goldie (Jaime King), a woman who Marv was with at night and framing him in the process. However, another tale, this one involving Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a former cop who vows to prevent a pedophile (Nick Stahl) dubbed 'The Yellow B--tard' due to his appearance is literally frightening (and I mean more frightening than Freddy Krueger) from harming Nancy (Jessica Alba).If the visuals and the music make the movie very creative, then you have to mention the cast for sure. Miller and Rodriguez deserve a lot of credit in getting the right actor or actress for each key part in the three tales. Another thing, when Golden Globe and Oscar nominations come out, this movie shouldn't be overlooked, period.Encore! Encore! Encore!",9,2,4,1 September 2005
Gladiator," A respectable and fairly engaging Roman epic.
","A respectable and fairly Roman epic about a much beloved Roman general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who instead becoming the next emperor of Rome is forced to be in the gladiator fights, which were fierce and...a bit on the bloody side.  The strongest parts of this Ridley Scott film are the excellent fight scenes and the performances of veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (who died during the filming).  Only the appearence and design of Rome look very grainy and unpleasant.  I have some doubt why this movie received some Oscars that included Best Actor (Crowe, no offense) and Best Picture.  The only nominations that this film should deserve are Best Supporting Actor for Reed and Djimon Hounsou instead of Joaquin Phoenix (brother of the late River Phoenix).",8,0,0,8 October 2001
Goodfellas," One word: priceless
","If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas': it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book 'Wiseguy').There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.",10,313,455,6 November 2004
All the President's Men," I was satisfied but not seduced.
","Entertaining and nearly mind blowing political thriller (based on the true story novel by the actual Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein) about the two reporters (Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in memorable performances) who both unveil the shocking and unbelievable truth behind the foiled break-in at Watergate (also known as the headquarters of the Democratic Party).  And that would only lead to the infamous scandal, followed by the resignation of President Nixon.  The late Jason Robards, who won a Best Supporting Oscar for his interesting and funny portrayal of Ben Bradlee, the editor of the Washington Post.  Hal Hoolbrook deserves some credit for his performance as 'Deep Throat', the mysterious informant who tells Woodward (Redford) in the parking garage - 'Just follow the money.'Alan Pakula directed the film and makes the film's most tense moments perfect and William Goldman also won  an Oscar for his story.I have to admit that I was satisfied but not seduced although I like history.",9,2,3,20 February 2001
High Fidelity," Sweet and wickedly funny.
","A sweet and wickedly funny tale of Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a struggling music store owner who deals with his two assistants: Barry (Jack Black), who is basically a nutcase and Dick (Todd Louiso), who is the opposite and presents himself as quiet and easygoing.  Rob, Dick, and Barry spend their days in the store, constantly talking about any type of music.However, Rob is emotionally crushed when his latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), dumps him for Ian (Tim Robbins), a quiet man who has the appearence of a neat freak.  When Ian comes into the store one day and talks to Barry, Rob, and Dick in a calm manner.  Each one has a fantasy of their own which consists of verbally chewing out Ian and scaring him away or beating the living daylights out of him.  I must admit that scene made me both laugh and cringe for a short moment.'High Fidelity' marks the reunion between Cusack and the British director, Stephen Frears ('The Hit'), who made 'The Grifters' in 1990 with Cusack in one of the lead roles.John Cusack is great here and in some scenes, he talks directly to the screen about some of the real-life facts in Chicago, where the film was made in, but the novel by Nick Hornsby was done in London.  Chicago and London look very similar even though both cities are in different countries.Besides Cusack, there are some great supporting performances turned in by Black and Louiso, who seemed more interesting out of the duo.  Hjejle is solid here as the girlfriend.  Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic')and singer Bruce Springsteen appear here in cameos.Composer Howard Shore conducts a solid score and the photography by Seamus McGarvey is simply brilliant.'High Fidelity' may be one of Cusack's best films and those people who head the Academy should do themselves a big favor - give Cusack an Oscar.",9,0,1,14 March 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A real hoot.
","Hilarious and glorious adventure set in Mississippi during the Great Depression about three convicts (Everett - George Clooney, Pete - John Turturro, and Delmar - Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from prison and try to stay a step ahead of their demented pursuers although they're attached to each other in chains and search for a bundle of money that the Clooney character claims to have hid from the authorites.The Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel), who (are now the masters of dark comedy since director Stanley Kubrick passed away) have certainly created another gem in 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' and the film's story is based on 'The Odyssey' by Homer and 'Sullivan's Travels'.  There are plenty of bizarre and funny moments in the movie like watching KKK members dance and sing before a hanging (my favorite) and the convicts who run come upon three singing women (sirens) who are washing their clothes in the river.Also, the film's photographer, Roger Deakins, has done a remarkable job here in capturing the scenery and the composer, T-Bone Burnett (Love the name), brings in a lovely mix of country and bluegrass songs.  One of the bands that's appears on the soundtrack - The Soggy Bottom Boys  actually consists of the convicts and a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil for the guitar.The best performances that stand out in the film are given not by Clooney (who's mocking Clark Gable), but by Nelson, who has a few great one-liners and John Goodman, who appears as Big Dan Teague, a slithery and loud one-eyed Bible salesman.'O Brother' is a real hoot.",8,0,0,15 May 2001
The Godfather," Movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.
","If there was one valuable and simple lesson that I learned from watching 'The Godfather'.  I learned that movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.This film was based on the unforgettable novel by the late Mario Puzo and it was wonderfully adapted into the story that was written by Puzo himself and Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film.The film is like the book itself, it's extraordinary and respects the subject that it focuses on.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are terrific in their roles and there are several scenes that left me both surprised and in awe.  Some of the violent moments aren't only graphic, but very grizzly as well.  The baptism massacre, one scene where Sonny (James Caan) is setup and is shot up like a piece of Swiss cheese, and another scene where Vito (Brando) is shot in public and Fredo (the late John Cazale) can't even shoot the two hoodlums best illustrate how ugly living in the Mob can get.Besides the other film that was directed by Coppola ('Apocolyspe Now') that I deeply cherish, this film has a great supporting cast and I've mentioned a few of those key actors.Even Coppola's daughter, Sofia, who would later star in the third 'Godfather' film and have also directed her first film ('The Virgin Suicides'), is unbilled as the baby that is baptised in the church before the unpleasant massacre starts.",10,1,3,17 January 2001
