Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not as great as most people say it is.
","I was brimming with excitement when the line Episode 1 came on, and all throughout the movie I was excited with the visual effects and the awesome lightsaber duels. Not as great as Empire (the best Star Wars ever) or the original, but a tad better than Jedi(even though I like that one too. Definitely sets us up for the second movie, which I'm sure will more then make up for this movie's shortcomings.",7,0,0,23 May 1999
Scary Movie 2," A sequel thats better then the original.
","First let me tell you about the original..I thought it was dull boring and not that funny.With that out of the way, I loved this one!!The opening sequence alone is the worth the price of admission. Anna Farris is a goddess in this film, she is so hot, not to mention a great actress(really? Why hasnt she been in more mainstream films?).Sure there is a choppiness to the film, and not all the jokes work, but this is still better then half the crappy comedies out there. And like I said before, better then the immensly lame, first film.",10,0,1,5 July 2001
