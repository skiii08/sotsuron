Hereditary," Gotta love movies that remind us horror isn't all about shock.
","This film here isn't all that much about how or even why people die, it's for most of its runtime about the terror deaths inflict on loved ones. It's rather easy to understand the situation the on-screen character is in and the pain he has to live through. It's disturbingly well crafted to touch you and make you feel fear in ways other than shock or surprise.However, no amount of story, acting, cinematography and proper continuity will make you able to fully ignore the absolutely horrendous CGI in this film. Some scenes are a plain 0/10 and nearly all of them are pretty much completely unnecessary. It's so bad, it drags down the entire rating. Every single piece of CGI took me out of the experience and made me hate what I'm seeing for minutes.It's a good piece of horror and probably one you may want to watch with your family, if you're all into it. Just... someone rather nitpicky might have a lot to complain about.",7,1,3,1 February 2020
La La Land," I cried the entire way home after watching it, out of joy.
","I was awaiting this one with rather great tension, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.I will not talk about the musical - story ratio, how well written the female main character is or why I slapped the first person who insulted this movie in my proximity. What I will say is that I was never touched like this by any other work of art. This masterpiece takes itself very, very seriously. It takes its time to deliver the best paced love story I have witnessed, every single act being its own short, supported by almost stupidly well written and performed music as well as jokes which weren't even remotely out of place. Additionally, and by no means I want to undercut the other actors, Emma Stone delivered a performance which simply blew me away. Just 10 minutes in I was absolutely convinced this will grant her an Oscar, thankfully that was eventually the case.The movie is long, and the songs require your attention, especially when watching in a different language. That makes it very hard to endure if you have a short attention span or just didn't enter the cinema with maximum interest to begin with.In any other case, in my opinion, this is the movie of the century.",10,4,12,2 March 2017
Joker," Feels like watching a documentary
","When I watched Joker, I felt slightly underwhelmed. I couldn't really put my finger on whatever my problem with the film was, but after getting some distance, I can.It has quite some terrific acting. On a technical level (production design, cinematography, etc.), it's very pleasing to watch. My problem however, is the story: there is, at least in my opinion, no shock, no turning point, no surprise. It feels like watching a documentary. You aren't supposed to develop sympathy for Arthur, nor cheer for him, you are just meant to understand him. But to understand the fact that unchecked poverty and chained misfortune can drive a person into madness, I don't have to watch a movie.There are quite a few scenes which are rather open to interpretation, including the ending, but whatever interpretation you prefer, at best, Arthur is slightly 'more in the right', but it changes nothing to the finale and that one is kind of unambiguous. You are bearing witness to a logical string of events which result in a foreseeable outcome. By the end of the movie, I don't really know what makes Arthus special in the world he's in. Maybe that's the point, that he's not, and it's fine, as he is not like the other Jokers. It still makes me wonder: what was the 'point' of it all? It'd be a bit of an unfair understatement to call the whole thing trivial, but there seems to be no moral, no back and forth, no question at the end. It's just a plain road of a simple-minded man to hell.I'd still suggest it to specific people, but I don't think 10/10 is justified.",7,1,2,24 November 2019
