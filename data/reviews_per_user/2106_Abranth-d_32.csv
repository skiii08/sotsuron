Ford v Ferrari," Woah
","Here's my review of Ford v Ferrari . So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement.",9,4,9,18 November 2019
First Man," Slow as a snail and yet wins the race somehow
","Here's my review of First man. So 'First man' is directed by Damien Chazelle known for Whiplash and La La land and I loved whiplash which made me look forward to this movie. The movie is a biopic of Neil Armstrong and before watching this I knew very little about him . Cause every other person whose biopic has been made is either a musicisan , an actor or a politician who had eccentric personalities of their own from Howard Hughes to Steve Jobs to Tommy Wiseau. Now Ryan gosling was great as Neil Armstrong and that's how I will remember him from now on. Claire foy as Janet Armstrong was really good too. This movie is a drama more than anything , it's not about mankinds first step , it's not about creating history , it's just about Neil Armstrong . This is a gorgeous , beautiful , amazing ( I've run out of synonymns for good looking ) movie. But despite that it's phasing is very slow , like super slow ! But there are some very intense as well as claustrophobic scenes and the only way to do them well was to do them slow. This movie is shot on film , so even while watching it on imax it has grains on it making it look like how it would be if the current era shot old movies. I thought that was pretty cool. Remember how in the dark Knight rises you couldn't understand a word out of Bane's mouth cause he was wearing a muzzle. In this movie there's a lot of stuff you can't hear over the scattered comms but that didn't really matter cause I wouldn't have understood the rocket science stuff anyway. There are also some scenes where a whole event is shown , like remember how in breaking bad season 2 they would show a whole breakfast table routine right from cutting the egg , adding pepper and eating it without cuts and we went along with it till we got to season 3 ? Well you have to sit through those scenes just like that to get to the good parts in this movie. There are some scenes where it's brilliant acting but no music to top it up . Like honestly I don't think I would've cried to musafa dying in lion king if it wasn't for the music. I don't understand why people only call movies set in the medieval era as epic cause I feel that anything inspiring is an epic and that's why First man is an Epic . In the end it was a great movie with phasing flaws and a lack of an emotional drive unlike whiplash and you'll have a great time unless you're Russian . I don't usually type this much but I felt if I hadn't people would have concluded this as a good / bad movie. But if you did read this much . Thank you . Much appreciated.",9,1,2,19 July 2019
War Dogs," Wolf of Wall Street with guns
","Here's my review of ' war dogs ' , so war dogs is this story about two childhood friends who team up and become illegal arms dealers for the penatagon aka war dogs , this movie has so many funny jokes as well as one liners from Jonah hill and this guy stole the show inspite of Bradley cooper being a part of the movie .miles teller did a good job too , but Jonah hill got the upper hand and his one liners were so funny like ' hold your tummy and laugh ' kind of funny and the supporting characters were good followed by a great screenplay and great dialogues ,I couldn't find anything bad about it , as soon as as the movie started , it didn't waste time on setting up characters and it jumped right to the plot within a few minutes.During the movie I felt as if I've seen these jokes and the cinematic touch somewhere and I realised that the movie was directed by Todd Phillips , the director of the hangover trilogy and that explains why Bradley cooper was a part of it and during the credits I noticed that he's the one who did the casting. So in the end , war dogs isn't kaboom ,kapoosh and bomb blasts ,its a solid entertainer with lots of laughter , relatable characters and an old school moral to not be greedy and just like will smith said ' don't lose focus ' you'll know what I mean ,once you finish watching the movie.",8,0,1,19 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Lady Gaga can act
","Here's my review of ' A star is born ' . The movie is directed by Bradley Cooper starring Cooper and Lady Gaga. Both of them were brilliant in this movie esp Lady Gaga considering how this is her debut from what I heard. The story is about this celeb singer with alcohol issues who then meets another singer at a bar and takes her to stardom while getting romantically involved with her. This movie felt like a fusion of '8 mile' and 'Begin again'. After 8 mile this is probably one of the best songs made for a movie. The music is just amazing , like go back and download right away sort of amazing. It has a lot of dark themes such as identity crisis , ego , jealousy and some good morales so either you're a person who gets them or you can just have fun with the songs . Either way it's pretty entertaining. However there are some scenes where the dialogue is too long and you're waiting for those convos to get over but it's only in a few scenes.In the end I felt Bradley Cooper's a great director especially with dramas and a ' star is born ' comes with great characters , an amazing list of songs , morales and everything a good drama requires.",9,0,0,19 July 2019
Knives Out," Instant classic
","Here's my review of ' Knives out ' . So knives out is directed by Rian Johnson, the guy who directed the infamous Last Jedi , but the movie I know him from his ' Looper ' which is quite awesome and made me look forward to this movie as well . The story is about the death of a mystery writer followed by a real time cluedo game with his family. If you've read enough Agatha Christie and Harry Potter you're gonna put the pieces in a matter of seconds , for those of you didn't , you'll have fun . What I loved about it was how they revealed the mystery a few mins into the movie and yet spun a tight web around it . The movie stars an ensemble cast of Daniel craig , Chris Evans , Michael Shannon , Ana de Armas and many more , the huge cast wasn't a marketing stunt and every character had a purpose followed by proper screen time , they were like the pilot episode of a great sitcom, being likeable characters at first sight . The movie is also beautifully shot and masterfully edited and I bet it's getting nominated for an academy for any of those . I also liked how the movie was able to tonally shift seemlessly from one part murder mystery parody to one part black comedy to one part thriller , and Rian Johnson handles that like a pro . My only gripes with this movie was Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn like accent which turned out to be intentional and pointed out towards the end . So with great characters , edge of the seat edits , masterful shots , one liners which land and one literal cluedo game , Knives out is an instant classic and Rian Johnson's biggest apology letter for the last Jedi .",9,0,3,2 December 2019
The Irishman," He's back
","Here's my super late review of the Irishman . So 'The Irishman' is directed by Martin Scorcesse and it's out right after his comments against marvel and popcorn movies in general , and he shuts people up with this movie alone. The movie stars Scorcesse's homeboys De Niro , Pacino and Pesci . The movie is his forte , almost like a revival of Goodfellas , it's about mobsters , and no one knows better about that than Scorcesse cause he's lived it . The ensemble and legendary cast were amazing despite the trash prosthetics and deaging cgi . The story once again is like Goodfellas , but more in line with the association between the Teamster's Union and the mafia. It has all the Scorcesse trademarks from rise to power , leaving your wife for an other woman , abusing power , drugs , fancy restaurant meetings , betrayal , sugar , spice and everything nice . The movie is produced by Netflix and is 3 and a half hours long giving the Lord of the rings a run for it's runtime. Since it's produced by Netflix the movie is free of strict censorship and works more in line with the directors vision , the cinematography is gorgeous and has neatly written and quotable dialogue followed by rich production design. Now I saw a lot of articles and reviews online calling it a boring movie , but it's not and I'm not gonna say it's a ' slow burn' or anything , in fact it's fast phased film for its runtime , if you keep up with it by googling for technical terms like ' truckers union ' and stuff you will be caught up with the movie and you'll be hooked , I can guarantee that. The internet also calls it an epic , but even though the story is an epic , stoic characters despite being great don't support it . In the end , the Irishman is a modern day reboot of Goodfellas with a stellar cast , gorgeous production design , all of Scorcesse's tricks and one big brush to paint your houses.",8,2,3,2 December 2019
Deadpool 2," The merc with the mouth shines again
","Here's my review of Deadpool 2. So Ryan Reynolds is back again as the Merc with the mouth and he does justice to the role by being the Johnny Depp to capn jack and the rdj to iron man. The movie is directed by the guy who made John wick and that results in the movie having zero shaky cams and solid action scenes unlike the first one. I also liked how there was a lot going on in this movie compared to the first one's linear plot. The kid who played Ricky in the Wilderpeople movie is in this and he does a really good job. Josh Brolin was great as thanos this year , and was good as cable ,but I can think of a hundred actors who could've played the same role . The pop cult references were neat and some of the jokes landed very well.The cgi however was not that impressive for such a big franchise, no I'm not saying it's like 'Henry Cavill mush' like cgi , its just that it was revealing. In the end Dp 2 is the perfect sequel the first one can ask for with great action , memorable characters , studio assaults and probably the funniest fourth wall / post credits scene in movie history.",8,1,2,19 July 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Waititi all the way !
","Here's my review of Thor :Ragnarok . So , Chris Haemsworth is back once again to wield the hammer. Despite being a sequel to the god awful 'dark world' this movie blew me away , there was not a single dull moment in this movie , very fast phased with a really good soundtrack that went with it , especially lord Zeppelins immigrant . This movie took in so many new characters and gave them the right screen time . No matter how cool marvel movies are , the villains are not too challenging , but Kate blanchet as Hela was beast. Probably the best villain the MCU has to offer. Loki has a lot of character development in this movie and it hit it right. Hulk has a pretty good amount of screen time and how they pulled of the jekyl and Hyde thing was pretty cool especially how they made hulk talk. Now putting everything aside , the one liners in this movie are perfectly placed and they are too funny , like the hold your tummy and laugh kind of ones. If the one liners weren't placed right , this movie would've looked like a spoof , but nah , it nailed it.Thor ragnarok is an absolute treat . I'm not saying this cause I'm into superheroes , its just that good of a movie . And is definitely worth watching on imax and is inarguably the best superhero movie of 2017 , right beside wonder woman.In the end , Thor is not just philosophy convos with Odin , its the perfect entertainer with top notch CGI , crunching 80 s music , a big green monster , quotable dialogue and the perfect setup to infinity war. Can't believe I typed so much ... I guess its the power of lightning and lord Zeppelins immigrant song stuck in my head.",10,1,6,19 July 2019
Ready Player One," Spielberg all the way
","Here's my review of Ready Player One. The movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. The story is about a treasure hunt on a virtual world while fighting an evil Corp ( not a Mr robot reference) but yes , this movie is packed with Easter eggs and references and trust me , all that useless pop culture knowledge you have is gonna be of great use in this movie. The virtual world aka 'the Oasis' is just down right 'beautiful'. All the actors in the movie were good and especially the bad guy , he was great. The movie also stays true to its source material , a book of the same name by Ernest cline. The movie has great cgi and there is absolutely nothing I could find to pick apart this movie. It's that 'flawless'. In the end , Ready Player one is not a video game movie , its a fun ride , with great characters , an edge of the seat plot , loads of Easter eggs and one egg to rule them all ( not a lotr reference). it's one of those movies which brings out the kid in you , ten years down the line this movie will be called a 'classic'.",10,1,2,19 July 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A good reboot !
","Here's my review of spiderman : homecoming. So , Tom Holland was great as spiderman . He was funny , athletic and smart just like how you saw him in civil war. Michael Keaton was great as the vulture , even though he could have been a little more intimidating , not just the bad guy , the whole plot could've been a little dark , it was too cheesy , I'm not saying bad , but it was cheesy like its TV series . Some things which pissed me off , was how spiderman talked to the AI in his suit and depended a lot on stark tech , because spiderman talks to himself while swinging by and one of the original traits of his is not depending on tech except for his web shooters . The supporting cast was great too , especially the fat Asian dude . Aunt may was good in this movie , but more uncle Ben memories would have boosted the emotional drive , which was lacking in this movie. Iron man was cool , and he knew his place without crowding it. The music in this movie is really cool and that too how they did a remix to the classic theme song which blended really well with the action sequences. In the end , homecoming is a perfect summer movie with lots of cheesiness , web slinging fun and wall crawling action and perfectly timed one liners. Oh yes , there's a post credits scene and an end credits scene , the end credits scene however ... Just watch it .",7,0,1,19 July 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," I heard it on my radioooo !
","Here's my super late review of Bohemian Rhapsody. As far as I've noticed if a guy's eccentric and happens to be a celebrity then Hollywood's ready to make a biopic : the wolf of Wall Street , Molly's game , Jobs and the list goes on. Despite that those movies felt inspirational , I just felt Bohemian Rhapsody didn't have that heart to it. The movie stars Rami malek as Freddie Mercury and that's an Oscar contender right there. I still felt Sacha baron Cohen the initial choice would've been much accurate , Malek was amazing it's just that Cohen would've been better. My knowledge of queen is very mainstream and even I felt that Freddie Mercury in this movie was a fusion of Jake Gyllenhaal's Lou bloom meets Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs meets Johnny depp's Ed wood. The music in this movie was great , I'm not talking about the soundtrack I'm talking about the original queen songs. And the idea how they put up the lyrics like in a music video when the song was playing was a smart idea. The final act in this movie is just really amazing. You could just feel the energy in the air . In the end Bohemian Rhapsody is not an epic but it's sure as hell entertaining with a wide array of songs to sing along to.",7,0,0,19 July 2019
Baby Driver," A go home and Google soundtrack.
","Here's my review of baby driver. So baby driver is directed by Edgar Wright , the genius behind the Scott pilgrim movie . Imagine the cop chase from grand theft auto with a little bit of drama , that's what this movie is. From start to finish , this movie is a joy ride . The dialogues are well written and there were some pretty solid one liners. Now , the soundtrack in this movie is really good , its one of those movies where you come back home and Google for the song in a particular scene . All characters in this movie were really good , there were no unwanted characters or subplots and it stuck to its story. In the end , baby driver is a unique movie with great action , likeable characters , no cliches and a go home and Google soundtrack.",10,0,1,19 July 2019
Justice League," Had it's flaws but still works
","So it finally happened , the greatest heroes finally united and I got to see it first hand . Here's my review of JUSTICE LEAGUE . So Zack Snyder did his take on finally uniting the league with a bit of Joss whedon's touch then and there. What this movie did was correct all the mistakes from bvs , like constantly brooding characters and bad edited fights. They even got batman right . I'm not the biggest supporter of batfleck , but with a little character tone down and a better 'not so buff' suit , he did great. Gal gadot was great as wonder woman and her screen space was right. Ezra miller was close to perfect as the flash , considering his new take being more like the mcu's current spiderman and him using the speed force was gold ! Jason momoa was good as aquaman , but he should have gotten more screen time . now the whole movie is very light hearted and is very different form the other dceu movies , but light hearted in a not so cheesey way . Steppenwolf wasn't such a great villain , but hey they're saving Darkseid for the best , and a less intimidating villain is what we need for the team to unite. The biggest problem with this movie is the CGI and that's probably due to switching between directors and stopping production in the middle , and cyborgs suit was pretty revealing , and that too was fixed in the end in a good way .Throughout the movie , there was just one civilian family and that was pretty annoying. Now the most important thing a team up movie needs is good music , sure there were quick references to the classic batman theme and the wonder woman theme , but the overall soundtrack wasn't that good as the album songs from white stripes and godsmack . This movie gave quick glimpses to the lanterns and Shazam and some real hype giving post and end credits scenes. So yeah , justice league had its flaws but it was so entertaining that you don't look much to pick on it. In the end , justice league came out right , with legendary characters , heart pumping easter eggs , fan screaming moments and one big ticket to the hall of justice.",7,2,5,19 July 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," What it means to be Spiderman
","Here's my review of Spiderman : Into the Spider verse. When I saw the trailer for this movie I wasn't impressed , in fact I thought it was a cashgrab from sony with the remaining rights for Spider-Man they have left. And I was wrong. The story is about different spider men / woman from different dimensions , it's also an origin movie for Miles morales' spiderman. For those of you who've watched the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon crossover, the characters might not be new to you but they're all just wayyyy better than the tv epsiode. The animation in this movie is like stop motion but with a very fast frame rate which you grow on with as the movie progresses. The artstyle is just super cool , it's like a comic book with the thinking boxes and the POW , BAM stuff ! . The movie has really good voice actors and a powerful soundtrack , cause sony ( duh) and yes ! Tons and tons of product placement . The humour in this movie is really good , it's the best I've seen in animated movies since Zootopia. The movie has loads of Easter eggs , fourth walls , one liners which makes your spider sense tingle. In the end , into the spiderverse was way beyond my expectations , with great characters , 4th wall breaking , a slick artstyle , great humour and everything you love about Spiderman . It's like if 90s Disney made a Spiderman movie that your kids will be watching on repeat mode , ten years down the line.",10,0,1,19 July 2019
Dunkirk," Woah
","Here's my review of Dunkirk. So , Nolan is back after 3 years and unlike his other movies , Dunkirk does not have plot twists or cliffhangers . It's a very simple plot about the evacuation of soldiers , but its the cinematography which makes the movie so good . Everything in this movie , feels very real , that you can actually relate to the people in the situation . I couldn't recognise much of the cast except for Cilian Murphy , Tom Hardy and the dude from one direction , but everyone did a great job. There isn't much dialogue in this movie and that's a good thing , because the visuals do the talking. It was a bit annoying when the soldiers referred to the Germans as 'the enemy' , its not like Hitler is Voldermort or anything. And also , I didn't care when anyone died in the movie , as no character's past is revealed. Hans zimmer's score was really good , but not in the level of pirates or lion king. This movie is very fast phased unlike Nolan's previous movies and cuts to the chase , right when it starts. In the end , Dunkirk is an epic movie with great action , a great soundtrack , nail biting sequences , underdeveloped characters .... What else ? , its a Nolan movie , go watch it !!!",9,0,3,19 July 2019
Toy Story 4," A lot of sweating through the eyes
","Here's my review of Toy Story 4 . To be honest , I wasn't looking forward to this movie because I thought toy story 3's ending was a conclusive one and toy story 4 would be nothing but a cashgrab , and I was absolutely wrong. Toy story 4 is an epilogue to Toy story 3 and a really good one . Growing up I've noticed the different themes in these movies , the first one was about playing together , the second was about how toys shouldn't be collectibles but playthings , the third one was about growing up and moving on from the toys . Now this movie is the exact opposite , it's about how the toys grow up and move on ,and that bought a lot of man tears in this movie. The story is about this spork called 'forky' made into a toy by Bonnie who gets lost during a road trip and Woody makes it his mission to find him while also facing scenarios which make him rethink his own position. Believe me when I say that 10% of this movie is of the horror genre cause there are a few ventriloquist dolls with jumpscares and such . Key and Peele are in this movie as Ducky and Bunny and they are hilarious. Keanu Reeves is also in this movie as an action figure and I won't be surprised if he says ' Let's kaboom ' in John wick 4 , point is he was awesome ! The only gripes I had with this movie was how the other toys , even buzz had less screentime when compared to Woody who was pretty much the lead in this movie , I was also dissapointed on how there was less bromance b/w buzz and Woody than in the other movies. But these are just little things that bothered me. In the end , Toy story 4 is a trip down memory lane with a fast phased , hard hitting story which strikes both adults and kids. That's something I've always liked about Pixar movies , they are kids movies with deep themes which makes them a great watch for all audiences , so with lovable characters , a satisfying epilogue and lot of sweating through the eyes , Toy Story 4 is an instant classic and is definitely one of the best movies of the summer , right next to Endgame.",8,1,2,19 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Till they assemble
","Here's my review of AVENGERS INFINITY WAR. That's right I had to type that title in caps cause that's how big this movie is. It's a Visual 'Marvel'. Get it ? Visual 'Marvel'. That's a bad attempt at humor.sorry. Moving on , iw is directed by the Russo brothers and stars almost everyone ?!. Now the story has a lot of arcs to it but is centralized to one Thanos. I loved how they set up character introductions along the way and made sure there was no phasing issues which is really important in a movie close to 3 hours. This movie is a really dark one but the one liners and humour are spot on and are never forced anywhere unlike justice league *cough* *cough*. I also loved how they took time to explore other worlds in the movie while there was so much going on , there is a lot going on in this movie , like a lot ! . But just like any other movie on the hype train it does have it's flaws. Remember how I said there were many arcs , sometimes the switch from one arc to another takes a really long time . Other than that , ok what else ? . The CGI in this movie is amazing but personally I thought they could've done better with iron man's armor. And even the little details on Josh brolins face were really good. And when you finally feel like these arcs are gonna combine and all for something bigger , then BOOM ! A cliffhanger right there.And it's an ending I'm still trying to figure out. In the end , avengers infinity war is something which travels beyond expectation , with great characters , a gripping story , great visuals and a cliffhanger ending for the avengers to actually 'assemble' in the next movie (hopefully) .",8,1,1,19 July 2019
Aladdin," Meh
","Here's my review of Aladdin ( the new one ,duh ). Let me cut to the chase , the movie wasn't great. No one expected it to be great from the very first look , heck I thought it was an Aladdin parody when I saw the first look. It's directed by Guy Ritchie who's known for the rdj starring Sherlock Holmes movies and man from Uncle. If you're familiar with Guy ritchie movies you'd know that they have very fast edits and zero track shots . So all of the Aladdin jumping off rooftops stuff is like that chase from Uncharted 3 but with bad editing. The guy who played Aladdin wasn't bad , he just didn't look like his 2d counterpart is all. Naomi Scott was great as Jasmine and Will Smith wasn't that bad as genie . The bar that Robin Williams set for genie was very high and I liked how will Smith didn't improv on that and did his own thing. Jafar in this movie was not even half as menacing as the 2d jafar , this guy is like a bad tv villain with bad monologues . The story is exactly the same as the original but with new additions like Jasmine wanting to become Sultan and Jafar being a former thief. There were a lot of scenes which looked like something out of a soap opera or a stage play than a movie . And most scenes just switched from tone to tone instantly , there was no character setup and the cave of wonders wasn't anything close to the original . Even the whole city of Agrabah didn't feel big in an epic scale it Should've been . This movie would've been much better if they'd done a scene to scene remake of the original . Of all the scenes they could cut for time , they cut that scene where jafar turns into a snake and traps Jasmine Into an hour glass , instead they just eased on the whole thing. Iago in this movie wasn't even a character, he was just a normal talking parrot. Oh yeah , the music in this movie was pretty good , they tweaked a lot of songs from the original and made it sound cool , but there was this new song they added to the roster and that was jasmine singing some woman empowerment crap , it got on my nerves. And there was a song at the credits featuring DJ Khaled and that's when I lost it. In the end , Aladdin doesn't live up to the original and while trying to be a musical with a bright colour tone , it looks more like a straight to tv movie on a big budget than a blockbuster. However , if you haven't seen the original , you might actually like this movie. I can go all day roasting Aladdin , but my fingers have gone numb from typing continuously .",5,3,4,19 July 2019
The Lion King," Slimy .... Yet satisfying .
","Here's my review of 'The Lion King'. Now I've watched a lot of movies , a LOT ! But if you ask me what is my favorite movie of all time , it's very hard to bring it down to one , but if you put a gun to my head and ask me to choose , I would say the Lion King in a split second , but not because of nostalgic reasons , but because it's just that flawless. With that being said I was talking about the original 2d movie , not this one . Before I start here's a heads up for lion King spoilers , I can't review the new one without comparing it to the original , but seriously who hasn't watched the original ? Unless you're one of those kimba protestors on Reddit.So the Lion King is directed by Jon favreau who I believe got the job cause he made the live action jungle book and a little movie called chef which is pretty much the Lion King without scar in a food truck. And I think he's the guy who holds up the vision for this movie . Speaking of Scar , he's not even half as menacing as Jeremy irons' scar from the original , I understand how they were going a for a ' live action'( cgi) scar and that they couldn't give him yellow eyes and a black mane , but the guy who played Mordo in Dr. strange voices him and he didn't work for me , Jeremy irons is up and running , I don't see why they couldn't shove 40 million down his throat and get him to come back.Just like scar , there are a lot of new actors in this movie , like John Oliver who replaces Rowan Atkinson as Zazu , but you don't know that until the credits roll . It's like Troy Baker doing Mark Hamill's Joker voice but also doing his own thing while he's at it , I felt they should've done something similar with Scars voice. Even Pumba is replaced with Seth Rogen and he was really good . Oh yeah , Timon and Pumbaa absolutely kill it in this movie , hilarious ! Despite having different voices and live action cgi bodies , they are show stealers all the way.I should've mentioned this at the start but this movie is gorgeous ! You just stop for a second and notice how much one can do with cgi . But the problem with a live action / cgi adaptation is that you have to remove a lot of things from the original animation , like a lot of the cartoon quirks for example . Such as the hoola distraction dance ( that still cracks me up even now ) , music videos like that shot where Simba is on top of a bunch of animals , The marching Hyenas and geysers from 'be prepared' and even little moments like scar singing to ' l like a lovely bunch of coconuts ' and just much more , but you get the idea. The other problem with a so called 'live action' adaptation is that even though the characters have pretty much the same lines from the original , they come out as rather 'stoic' than real .Now this movie is Ctrl c and Cntrl v of the original but with cgi , so how can that go wrong ? It can go wrong if you mess with the original. The truth is they didn't change anything about the original but instead added and deleted stuff to increase the time and package it into a two hour movie . Like for example there is a scene of Nala escaping from Pride rock past the Hyenas and scar . nope . Not in the original . For those of you who don't know , there was actually a scene from the original which got scrapped for not being very pg 13 , it involves Scar forcing Sarabi to be his queen , you can even see the leaked storyboard on YouTube. And it was scrapped for the right reason. They somehow tweaked a few lines from it into this movie which felt completely unnecessary . That's the additions . The deleted stuff from the original are both big and small moments which didn't work for me at all . Big moments like Mufasas' ghost in the sky was replaced with dense clouds which doesn't resemble any shape even . Rafikis speech about the past was cut , the last shot at pride rock with Timon and Pumbaa standing next to Simba was scrapped and even that little hug Simba gives Rafiki before ascending the throne was cut too , of all the things they cut for time , they cut these iconic moments and those little lines which make such a big difference.These are the part I was looking forward to , the songs ! And Hans Zimmer's out of the world soundtrack.When the movie began and the sun rose in Africa , I could just feel the energy among the audience who by the way were 20 something year olds or 17 at the least , no pesky kids or annoying babies. And the songs by Elton John certainly delivered even though they lacked some of the quirky comic visuals from the original , they delivered. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is iconic as it was two decades ago , but with a few tweaks , here and there but in a good way. The thing is , if you've watched the original , you'd know the cue for when a particular soundtrack is going to play and it plays right at the stampede sequence . But for me personally , the score when Simba goes back to pride rock past the desert is the best of all and when I was pumped for the cue / drop they replaced it with some Beyonce song which didn't work at all . Speaking of Beyonce , I didn't like her voice as older Nala either. Just like some of the scenes , some of the score and songs were added and deleted as well , 'be prepared' was replaced with ' be prepared ' but a shorter version with less energy , I understand why cause unlike the original you can't do that song without the quirky visuals and the neon colour tone. Unlike the deletes , the additional songs were actually good , especially the extended version of ' in the jungle , the mighty jungle'I know I said they only deleted and added stuff but didn't change or improvise. Guess I was wrong . You know the scene where Pumbaa beats up the Hyenas cause they call him a Pig . They replaced that with ' chubby ' like wtf dude ?! Either Disneys trying too much to hold on to the pg rating or kids these days are really sensitive. One of the other changes I noticed was fast cuts and reactions but I guess you can't blame them cause you have to cut from actions quick when you can't delay with emotion , since emotions come off quickly and stoic when you use cgi for a movie like this.But nevertheless , I still had fun with this movie , had a few man tears from the very same scenes from the original , loved the father - son dynamic b/w Simba and Mufaasa and laughed hard at the Timon and Pumbaa moments . It's visually striking , more like a nat Geo safari with talking animals even , has great talents and is aware of what it is. It's the kind of movie you watch on Imax and buy on Blu-ray. Even with all that it doesn't capture the magic of the original .In short . It was slimy .... Yet satisfying.",5,1,1,19 July 2019
1917," Roger Deakins is God
","Here's my review of 1917. So 1917 is directed by Sam Mendes , and I've been looking forward to this movie ever since the trailer dropped cause it's from the minds behind The war movie Jarhead which was also directed by Mendes and shot by frequent collaborator Roger Deakins. And I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was blown away ! . The story is set amidst world war 1 and it's about these two soldiers who have to get through a lot of German territory and notify their camp to stop the planned attack for the next day. The journey to the camp is filmed to look like a one shot with no edits like how birdman was shot. And the man who shot it was Roger frickin Deakins , the man who shot the Shawshank Redemption , Blade runner 2049 and pretty much every movie which is worthy of being your desktop wallpaper , and this movie is no exception. The way it's shot makes you feel claustrophobic and also like you're watching a first person shooter game. The score by Thomas Newman was great and added a lot of weight to the story. The gripes I had with this movie was that you don't really care much for the characters cause you don't know much about them and since it's a warzone it's no surprise if anyone dies really, and the dialogue felt very bland in b/w convos , but I guess that's how people really talk at a time of crisis and quotable dialogue would've made it seem more fictional. In the end 1917 is more of an experience than a movie and to sum it up , it's the Revenant meets Dunkirk .",9,7,10,19 January 2020
Logan," Wow !
","Here's my super late review of Logan .So Logan was directed by the guy who directed the not so good wolverine movie where he fights asian dudes. And this time he sure made a comeback with Logan. So needless to say , Hugh Jackman was great as wolverine and the little girl who played x23 was great too , the bad guy was good but would've sucked if it weren't for the R rating. Patrick Stewart was 'okay' as for most of the movie , he's just an old dude in a wheelchair annoying Logan. There are many references to the previous x men movies but without giving reason on what happened to the rest of the x men .The story is not your typical superhero movie , its a road trip drama with lots of gorey action and that's the best part , because you see wolverine for the animal he is. So ,in the end , Logan is not just a good superhero movie but a great movie with loads of action , good one liners , great characters and one big farewell for Hugh Jackman.",10,1,3,19 July 2019
The Dark Knight," The darkest batman movie of all time.
","The best batman movie of all time is what I can say about this movie.It has a great storyline followed by a great music score composed by hans zimmer.Every single person in the cast crew were great except for Maggie gyllenhaal who played district attorney Rachel Dawes and also batmans love interest.according to me ,Katie Holmes did a better job in batman begins and it felt quite different to see someone else in the sequel .needless to say Heath ledger played an intimidating joker as compared to the creepy joker played by Nicholson in batman 1989.I almost forgot Christian bale ,the man who played batsy,he did a great job as both batman and Bruce Wayne,and both characters had a difference ,which means that I can not see Bruce wayne inside batman.its a great story with great characters along with great dialogues and great music.my overall view is that it's a great movie,worth watching and I should say that Nolan has taken superhero movies to the next level.",9,0,1,13 November 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Somehow I liked it better than the first .
","Here's my review of GOTG vol 2. So the 'crew' is back for the second time to save the galaxy , I can't tell you who they're saving the galaxy from as that's a spoiler. Star lord , rocket , drax and gamora reprise their roles while David husselhof and sly Stallone make cameos.The best thing about the characters is that even in the crisis of situations , they never miss their sense of humour . Star lord makes a lot of pop cultural references and even the ending has something to do with a classic arcade game character.This movie has more drama and character development and that too mostly focusing on yondu and nebula. In the end , James gunn pulled of another perfect summer movie with loads of action , great one liners ,mind blowing CGI , top notch 80 s music and one adorable baby Groot.",7,1,1,19 July 2019
Joker," Taxidriver 2
","Here's my review of Joker , or Taxidriver 2 if I'm being honest . So ' Joker ' is directed by Todd Philips , who's best known for directing the hangover trilogy , due date and war dogs. I thought he was an oddball choice when it was first announced but I get why . The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck , a guy who is constantly tormented by society , and he was great ! .... As Arthur Fleck , but as the joker ? Well that's for you to decide . For me personally I thought he was good , definitely better than Leto's , but in b/w Ledger and Nicholson. The character of joker has has had many origins over his comic book and media appearances . From ' Gotham's ' Jerome valeska ' to Jack Napier , to the mobster from mask of the Phantasm. But the most popular ones are him falling into a pit of acid and the other one about him being a failed stand up comedian which then leads to the acid fall according to ' The killing Joke' by Alan Moore. This movie takes the failed stand up comedian thing from that , drops the acid thing and then sets up it's story , Which I thought was a really nod cause Joker's mainstream origin is now as familiar as Batman's origin. They also set up Batman's origin indirectly to the Joker's which I thought was personally brilliant . This movie justifies Joker's maniacal forced laugh as a medical condition and at one point brings in the question of whether it's legit or if he's faking it . Unlike other iterations the joker is more sane than other people , like from this scene at a comedy club where he's the only guy laughing at the good jokes and everyone else is laughing at the inappropriate ones , so he writes that fact down. This movie borrows a lot of themes from fight club such as the whole ' only when you lose everything are you free to do anything ' and many more. It's also very similar to Nightcrawler in terms of being an underdog story and in making us root for the underdog even though he's a cold blooded merciless. Which is funny because Nightcrawler was a modern take on Taxidriver and this movie is like 80% Taxidriver with the whole experimenting with your gun without a shirt on , the one liners , the philosophical talks , the gun on your temple gesture and lots more . The movie even has frickin Robert De Niro as a late night show host if you want more proof , which is ironic since De Niro plays a failed comedian who gets insulted by a show host in ' the king of comedy ' directed by scorcesse who also directed Taxidriver . God ! My head hurts. Yeah , so I did some googling and it turns out scorcesse helped out with the script . So it all makes sense now . I also liked how Joaquin Phoenix was able to go back and forth between his actual laugh and his medical condition laugh which is similar yet you can spot the difference from how the latter is soulless. That's some brilliant stuff there. I also liked how Phoenix was able make us hope he doesn't get beat up by people in a public train to hoping he doesn't kill that guy. The only gripes I had with this movie was that the soundtrack wasn't powerful enough when it needed to be and that in the third act in a TV studio set , Phoenix was overdoing it. In the end ' Joker ' isn't the best origin for the character , it's a movie which uses the characters label to gain hype for a Taxidriver spinoff which is amazing ! All that stuff I said about the movie being close to Taxidriver is not a critique. Because this movie is brilliant . So it's a great attempt to dive into the psyche of an anarchist and make you wonder .... Chaos is just order yet undeciphered.",8,2,3,2 October 2019
Marriage Story," When reality hits ...
","Here's my review of ' Marriage story ' . So marriage story is directed by Noah baumbach known for his intense family dramas and frequent writing collaborations with Wes Anderson himself. The movie stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson and it's about this couple going through a divorce . That's just about it. Sounds like a simple indie movie with a lot of crying and Keith urban in the background right ? Nope. This movie is very human and tries to tell a story which hits you with reality on every level , and the last time a movie did that was ' the pursuit of happiness ' . All the actors in this movie were great ! And added so much depth to the characters they played. Now the audience are like little kids not knowing whose side to take during the divorce cause both of them have strong points on their side that you don't know who to root for. The courtroom scenes and the lawyer's entry into this mutual consent makes it very intense at times. I should have said this earlier but Adam driver and Scarlett Johannson were amazing in this movie to the point that you don't know whether they're acting or not and I'm not even exaggerating . The dialogue feels very real and so does the overall environment . It's also masterfully shot and beautifully scored and it's one of the best movies I've seen this year which isn't part of a franchise or an adaptation of a comic book or video game. In the end 'Marriage story' Is a hard hitting tale with powerful acting , life like dialogue , an engaging narrative and proof that when reality hits , it hits hard.",10,4,7,14 December 2019
Black Panther," If the Lion King was a marvel movie.
","Here's my review of black panther . So Chadwick boseman reprises his role as tchalla and he was great ! The supporting cast with less vowels in their names were good too . Now my favorite character , killmonger of course , it's no surprise Michael b jordan is in every Ryan coogler movie . This movie felt very isolated from the rest of the mcu movies , sure movies like Thor Ragnarok have introduced us to new worlds. But wakanda is just so magnificent and isolated from the rest of the mcu . This movie has a soundtrack that is so good you can buy the vinyl stereo CD for it . The score is a rush of adrenaline and has a lot of goosebumps along. This movie gave off the vibe of lion King in a lot of places and had a lot of cliches like the 'fallen King shall rise' sort of ones. But unlike any other hyped movie , It has phasing issues , but the last act makes up for all the slow scenes. In the end , black panther was awesome ! It had great characters , nail biting action , and in a very long time in superhero movies , the bad guy has a great motive. In short it's blood diamond meets batman .",7,0,2,19 July 2019
Creed II," Satisfying sequel to both Creed and Rocky 4
","Here's my review of 'Creed II'. So creed 2 is not directed by Ryan googler and yet doesn't look different from the first movie. The movie stars Michael b Jordan as Adonis Creed and he was great ! But sadly his character wasn't as inspiring as Rocky balbao or Billy hope. The supporting cast were also great , esp sly Stallone as Rocky , there's so much wisdom he gives Creed that you feel like he's the grandfather you need. The story is about Ivan dragos son vs Creed's boy . When the first movie built on this idea , I thought it was really brilliant how they put a nod to the rocky universe. This time I felt it was more of a cashgrab idea to ripoff the rocky franchise nostalgics. But I was proven wrong with the final act in this movie. Even though this is a sports - drama , I felt the drama part overtook the sports part which despite being super slow was great ! . the training montage in this movie is like a music video but only with bad music. Once again the final act was just really amazing and the visuals were just on par with fine editing and fight choreography . It was like a fusion of warrior , south paw and rocky. In the end I wasn't a big fan of the first Creed movie and I felt this one is much better despite its cashgrab moments .",7,0,1,19 July 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," That's the best they have time offer ?
","Here's my review of batsy vs supsey,First of all I want everyone to know that the guy in this movie is not batman its just affleck in a batsuit and Jesse eissenberg is not lex luthor ,he's just a psychotic version of zuckenberg ,I personally liked Jeremy irons as Alfred as he's in a completely different role from simon peter Gruber ,the role of CGI is just too much,and the cameras during fight sequences is a bit shaky and fast for a Zack Snyder movie which usually has a lot of slow mos ,the story is not complicated or anything its just that all the subplots don't seem to connect to the finale of the movie,I personally don't have a problem with cavill as superman but he's not like the one and only guy who can play superman.Gal gadot was a good choice for wonder woman even though she had limited screen time.The only thing I found funny was that the Pentagon aka military guys don't show up when these guys are fighting,they're just sitting in their choppers so that something good might happen .In the end bvs is a good movie ,I'm not gonna say it was awesome I'm just saying it'll always be better than batman and Robin, but this movie is just a a milestone for the DC universe as there are a lot if JLA references as well as clips ,I'm warning you ,just leave the theatre onece the movie is over don't stay there expecting post credits scene or an end credits scene cuz there ain't one.",6,3,4,19 July 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Home alone meets Diary of a wimpy kid set amidst world war 2
","Here's my review of JoJo Rabbit . So JoJo Rabbit is directed by Taika Waititi , the  genius with an Ace Ventura persona who gave us Thor frickin Ragnarok ! which was one of my favorite movies of 2017 and that made me look back at his old films and the one thing common among them is that they're really funny but with a lot of human connection . Taika's humour is a unique brand that only he can land and that's what makes this movie work so well. The movie stars this pre drug use McCauley Culkin lookalike kid who's just brilliant in this movie ! The story is set in Germany amidst world war 2 where JoJo , a wannabe boy scout and Hitler fanatic comes across a Jew girl in hiding and becomes skeptical over his priorities . Taika Waititi himself , like in all his movies plays an extended cameo of JoJo's imaginary version of Adlof Hitler and he was bloody brilliant as well , Scarlett Johannson plays JoJo's Mom and she's on a roll with this and last year's ' Marriage story ' some damn good acting right there. Other supporting characters which includes Sam Rockwell as Captain k was hilarious ! All other characters were written brilliantly and had the right screen space. The movie takes you in for a satire on war and turns into something much more amazing as it progresses. In the end JoJo Rabbit is heartwarming , heartbreaking , funny , and is pretty much home alone meets Diary of a wimpy kid set amidst world war 2.",10,1,2,31 January 2020
Deadpool," Perfect origin
","Here's my review of deadpool, so needless to say Ryan Reynolds was great as deadpool more of a type casted persona like capn jack ,the movie has great camera scenes without too much explosions like a Michael bay movie,it turned out to have a steady cam ,which shows you exactly what is going on,the role of dark humour and smirk comedy is hilarious I bet Zach galafaniakas couldn't have stood a chance,the thing which made feel like I was punched in the tummy thrice was the fact that the dumb Indian censor board had to cut off the scene where deadpool kills 3 guys with a bullet.And the supporting characters were really great and the pop cultural refs and slapstick humour had its place .In the end deadpool is a notable movie in the golden age of superhero movies and of all it has a great story with awesome characters and the guy who played the recent transporter sucked like anything. If you ask me if you could take your little cousin ,then this is no movie for him and I mean it ,and don't blame me if your little cousin becomes Frankenstein Jr.",9,0,1,19 July 2019
Annihilation," Strange yet inspiring
","Here's my review of Annihilation. So if you're wondering why you haven't heard about this , that's cause the distributors pulled it down from the theaters last week cause it wasn't doing well there. And hence it's on Netflix now. This is a movie I've been looking forward to especially since it's directed by Alex Garland , the guy who gave us ex machina. The movie stars Natalie Portman and oscaar Isaac and it's about a small biome causing changes in nature. And getting closer to what's causing it and why ?. makes this slow movie interesting. This movie had some great acting and screenplay. This movie has a couple of monsters prowling around and has very predictable jump scare moments and some scenes gave off the vibe of a b grade horror movie , they should've worked on that. Depsite being creepy , dark and weird. This movie is nothing less than ex machina and a really good mindbender right beside arrival . In the end it's Natalie Portman in an other weirdo movie right after Black swan with great writing , intense characters and taking one step closer to annihilation.",7,1,3,19 July 2019
Incredibles 2," Not bad.
","Here's my review of Incredibles 2. So the super family shows up 14 years after it's release and is directed by Brad bird ( I know it sounds like a superhero name ) the genius behind Ratatouille, Toy story and other Pixar classics. I liked how they continued right where the first movie left off and also continued using analog tech from then without switching to smartphones for the new movie. Before calling it a Pixar movie it's first a superhero movie and that calls for a good villain . Was there a good villain ? .... Kind of ...ish. when you're playing masked identity with the villain then you should make sure that there are many suspects like a Scooby Doo epsiode. So yeah , you find out who the big baddie is within the first few minutes and the reveal didn't come out as a surprise . And Jack jack , my God. This baby and his superpower experimenting is so cool and adorable to watch at the same time. No sooner will jack jack plushie dolls start hitting the market. I also liked how this movie was big in size as a sequel but also had a light hearted story than the first one. The action in this movie is amazing. and it shows how much difference cgi can make to a franchise 14 years later. In the end Incredibles 2 was what I expected , it's the most fun I've had with animated movies in recent years after zootopia. With great characters , an iconic soundtrack , family bonding , jack jack , and one exclusive clothing line from Edna mode which can give Gucci a run for it's money. ( With no capes of course .)",8,2,3,19 July 2019
