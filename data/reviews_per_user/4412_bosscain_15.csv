Kill Bill: Vol. 2," dead bill
","ahh,kill bill 2,what can you say about such a 'masterpiece' In my comment about the first volume,I said that it was reminiscent of an Ed Wood jr. film. which true film connoisseurs can explain to you that his movies were so bad that they went full circle and returned to the opposite side of the good rating.but sadly comparing this movie to a Ed Wood jr.classic would be and injustice to the late Ed Wood jr. himself.Image if you were to watch every bad film ever made,summarize it down into two 2 hour volumes,add cliches,bad,old and hasbeen actors and actresses,terrible direction,cheesey dialog,poor script,throw in some bad chop-socky from kung fu films of the 70's,gratuitous violence and blood for todays culture stricken youth and you have this monsterpiece kill bill. 1/10",Null,0,1,17 April 2004
Hostel," Most disturbing movie I've seen in many years
","This really isn't your typical horror movie where some crazy maniac chases you with a axe or chainsaw, it isn't a movie where some stupid little doll,munchkin,mythical creature or space alien chases,shoots,eats or threatens to destroy you.Over the years those movies have become general and run of the mill. What this movie is, is a disturbing, unnerving, psychological thriller that as you watch it, It feeds off the real fears and horrors of the real world.A horror that can actually happen to you.When you watch a slasher movie,you already know that its fake and a story made up for Hollywood.But as this movie shows, an ordinary average college aged person, much like you and I, can indeed fall victim to this type of scenario, and in fact is possible in todays greedy money hungry world where if you have enough cash you can pretty much do anything you please.",Null,3,6,7 January 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," good movie
","I found this movie to be entertaining the special computer effects complete and engaging the storyline interesting and easy to follow and somewhat believable,that this could actually happen a few funny parts where 'I just droped in to do some shopping' and the massive reverse illegal crossing of american citizens into mexico. overall a great action movie with a good cast and a good plot.",Null,1,2,28 May 2004
Elf," ho ho hoax
","Elf is a great family film,filled with jokes and bathroom humor,I liked the tributes to the Rankin/Bass Rudolph the red nosed reindeer with the talking snowman and to the Big Foot sighting footage shot in the 60's.All around a fun holiday movie.",Null,0,2,9 November 2003
The Village," M. Night Shyamalan is back!!
","M. Night Shyamalan has returned to the directors chair with his new movie 'The Village'. This movie is so creepy and scary that you will literatly be shaking on the edge of your seat.This movie also is so fresh and new and original that it will still be fresh and new 10,50 even 100 years from now.the plot is excellent, the writing is edgy,the character development is profoundly bold and refreshingly  brave.the last 30 minutes of this film will make your jaw drop. I recommend this movie to anybody",Null,0,0,30 July 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," Just like Wolf Creek
","Even though this movie is a remake of a movie of the same name made back in 1977, this movie has striking similarities to an Austrailian movie called 'Wolf Creek'. This movie has a family going on vacation driving through the desert, Wolf Creek has a two couples going on vacation driving through the Austrailian Outback (also a desert). This movie has the family stopping at a gas station and being greeted by a grizzly old man. Wolf Creek also has a similar gas station stopping scene. This movie has one of the characters walking to a big huge crater, Wolf Creek has the characters walking to a big huge crater. This movie has a family of crazy deformed mutants killing people stripping them of their valuables and junking their cars, Wolf Creek has a old crazy man that kills his victims strips them of their valuables and junks their cars, the list just goes on and on. Plus the deformed mutant in the wheelchair reminded me of the video 'Rubber Johnny' by Aphex Twin.",Null,0,1,10 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," not as good as the first
","I thought this third installment of the Harry Potter movies was lacking. lacking of the charm that the first two movies had. The storyline was muddled and thrown together two quicklythe whole time traveling aspect of the movie was really bad and not well written. Im disapointed in this movie,since I looked forward to seeing itfor such a long time.",Null,1,2,5 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS
","this movie was monumentous,in cast,script,direction,cinematography.not since the age early years of the silver screen has a movie shown so brightly,so vividly,and had such a powerful effect.this movie is by far an A+ effort,if imdb's scale went up to 15 instead of 10,it still wouldnt be high enough to rate this masterpiece.",Null,0,2,23 January 2004
Cars," best Pixar movie since Toy Story
","upon entering the theater I wasn't expecting anything wow and big from pixar since the last few movies they made really didn't hit it off with me. But I Love 'Cars'!! its the best movie that pixar has created in a long long time. Not since the early days of 'Toy Story' have I enjoyed a Pixar movie so much that I wanted to write a comment about it. This movie is fantastic! It has everything you could ever want in a movie plus a whole lot more. The team over at Pixar really went over and beyond with this movie and all that hard work really shows.although the gags references and storyline are more for the adults than the kids, I still would recommend this movie to absolutely everybody. 10++++",Null,10,12,10 June 2006
The Incredibles," Incredibly dull
","Sniff,sniff....P-U, did somebody leave the garbage out on the back porch again?.. no thats The incredible foul odor of 'The Incredibles'. The new Pixar animated tale of an out of work super hero family that has to adjust to common everyday life in small town suburbia.Making due with housework, raising the kids, and holding down a crappy 9-5 job until they are called back on a secret mission on a strange remote volcanic isle. This movie is slow and boring and with little to no laughs. One person actually fell asleep a few rows in front of me!. Its sad to say but Pixar is loosing steam, after mega blockbuster hits like Toy story 1 and 2, A bugs life and Monsters Inc. This one just lacks that magic spark that the others had. See this only only if your a die hard Pixar fan or if the kids are wanting to see it, otherwise pass and see something else.",Null,1,2,5 November 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin Tarantino re-encarnated as Ed Wood jr.
","everybody in the film industry knows of the works of Ed Wood,his movies were so bad that they actually came full circle and were back at the good end of the scale again.QT has done this flawlessly with Kill Bill.Using has-been actors and actresses and using cheesy corny cartoon like sound effects.plus the 'broken water pipe on at full blast' gag when ever a limb was hacked off a person.Animation was a nice touch but if you are going to see this movie.DO NOT EAT before going to the theater,because seeing the close up of Uma Thurmans toes will make you want to throw up.those have got to be the most ugly,gnarly and disgusting in all of hollywood.",Null,0,1,12 October 2003
Saw," this movie packs a punch
","'Im gonna knock you out!, mama said knock you out!'. Thats exactly what is movie will do, itll knock you out like you've been hit by a prized champion boxer and you wont wake up until Tuesday of next week.This movie has more twists and turns than a San Francisco highway, you'll think you'll figure it out within the first 15 mins of the show, but your wrong, take everything you know about horror movies and throw it out the window cause this ones going to take you on one hell of a wild ride.Once you think you know where its going, BAM! it changes direction on you and the shocking twist ending will make you jump out of your seat. Don't miss this one, no cheap looking goulies, no hack and slash, no axe murderer chasing you through the woods, just pure heart pounding terror that will get down to the very essence of what you are. 10/10",Null,0,0,29 October 2004
The Last Samurai," excellent
","This movie is excellent,the action,the characters,the scenery,the story line.everything was perfect. At first i wasnt sure how Tom Cruise would do in this film,but he pulled it off masterfully,this film is one of the best ive seen this year.Akira Kurosawa could not have made a better film.A+",Null,1,2,5 December 2003
Love Actually," total rubbish
","This movie is the poster child for interacial dating and marriages as it profoundly throws it in your face time and time again.which I do not have a problem with it.it seems as the director or producer did it on purpose just to get a broader audience.which just goes to show that movies are not real life,they are just fantasy.nobody can sit in a bar and get 3 beautiful girls to drool all over you without even saying a word.",Null,0,1,11 November 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," not in todays world
","This movie was really good,high paced action and stylish drama But, In todays post 9/11 world It would not be so easy for our star to move about as freelyas he did in the movie. With face recognition technology and heightened security all over the world,it would make our would be super spy harder to travel to the places he goes. Overall, I did like this movie and would recommend it for people that liked the first Bourne movie. Not to be confused with the better Richard Chamberlain TV series of the same name.",Null,1,2,24 July 2004
