The Benchwarmers," One of the year's Lousiest films!
","I've seen more interesting things written on bathroom walls.The most interesting part of this film was the cool toys John Lovitz character owned.Rob Schneider hit a new all time low on this one, and that's saying something.I didn't think Napolean Dynamite could do worse than his original, I was wrong...It wasn't a really bad movie, until the end when it all comes together to make a point and have a moral behind the story...The best part was the credits rolling.",1,5,9,30 July 2006
