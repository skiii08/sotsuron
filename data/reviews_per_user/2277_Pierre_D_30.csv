The Double Life of Véronique," Splendid double life expertly explored.
","It had been a bear finding a properly subtitled version of this film, until the wonders of YouTube finally helped our cause. Irène Jacob's immeasurably understated grace and beauty permeate this film, from the first moments in Krakow where she elevates her voice to angelic proportions, to the second half where she tries to connect with herself in another way.Quickly put, we see two aspects of the same life and experience. Weronika in Poland, a radiant singer with little training but an apparent divine gift, enjoying life with full vigour and finally reaching the dream of become a stage presence, only to be seized from our world by the maker above. It seems unjust, but perhaps she had an inkling of trouble when she spotted her double on a bus slightly before, a jarring experience that nonetheless made her keep her focus.On the other side, in France, we find Véronique, who suddenly abandons singing to teach music to children. She finds herself intrigued by a puppeteer who strikes a cord within her with his marionette show, and slowly comes the realization that she is half of a now incomplete whole.Kieslowsky's brilliance shines in this movie. As we'll see later in his seminal Three Colors, he uses closeups of mundane items to represent stages of reflection or worry. In 'Bleu' it is a sugar cube dissolving in Julie's coffee while here we see a teabag immersing itself, emptying its flavour in hot water and thus ridding itself of its duties. Kryztof also perfectly captures Poland in revolutionary moments and the imperilled safety of one individual.Weronika goes from the ecstasy of singing to that of physical ardour to apotheosis whilst her French counterpart regresses from singing to teaching to fleeing to finding, and finally understanding. Jacob is near perfect here, hitting all the right emotive notes. Her almost radiant happiness as she sings hymns at the start, during a torrential downpour, is an unforgettable moment. Her grief at finding herself in the final scenes is also palpable, a bravura performance for the actress.A fine film, deep in starting blocks for other movies from this director, The Double Life of Véronique is a must for anyone who has led more than one life or feels connected to others.",9,3,5,19 February 2016
The Blair Witch Project," War of the Worlds for 1990s
","This film was excellently hyped. It is, in my mind, the same type of hype and drama that surrounded War of the Worlds so long ago.The actors all played along so well, the film was amateurishly shot and you could feel a sense of claustrophobia surrounding it. After all, who hasn't been scared of being lost in the woods, even if it was with two friends? The campers go from carefree arrogance and fun to utter, total fear in a matter of hours of recounting.The cabin, the symbols and dolls left outside were all quite eerie and the final chapter closes the movie abruptly and eerily. This and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre are the two movies that stopped me from sleeping for quite some time thereafter.In hindsight, we know The Blair Witch Project was a cleverly executed hoax, but for its time and its effect, it achieved a great deal of attention.8/10",8,2,3,25 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A kinder, gentler Black Mamba. *SPOILERS*
","The long-awaited sequel to Kill Bill Vol. 1 is worth the wait. There are no huge half-hour long swordfights, no exotic locales and caricatures of yakuza. Instead, we get a grittier look at The Bride (Beatrix Kiddo) as she takes to Texas and Mexico to chase her former mentor and lover, Bill.We get excellent background on the massacre at Two Pines Chapel, we learn more of the relationship between Bill and Beatrix, as they edge closer and closer. You, the viewer who has seen Kill Bill Vol. 1, knows that The Bride at that time has no idea of the upcoming massacre, and thus Bill's words ring with menace.We then cut to Budd, in one of the best scenes of the movie. While Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a pastiche of swordfighting, over-the-top action and so on, this one is stark, gritty, realistic. We see Budd has a dead end job and is looking for a fast buck. He dispatches of Beatrix with brutal efficiency, and the Texas Funeral was claustrophobic in the extreme. Elle is gorgeous and deadly. She IS 'blonde ambition' and she proves it by dispatching Budd, then giving Black Mamba more than a run for her money.
The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei is an excellent segment, showing the training she got, and Pai Mei is cruel, but efficient. I loved some of the sequences in this part, especially the training to punch walls.The last chapter is perhaps the most lush and stimulating, as Beatrix goes to find one of Bill's father figures, then Bill himself. And...Beatrix's child, B.B. :-> The child will melt your heart, and adds even more motivation for the bride to... Kill Bill.Does she? How does she do it? Go see the movie to find out. Hopefully QT will release these as a whole in the theatres.Five stars!",10,1,2,16 April 2004
Black Swan," The 'Fight Club' of Ballet? Perhaps...
","I had never heard of Black Swan before a local paper review tickled my fancy; glad it did because the two friends I dragged to see it throughly enjoyed themselves. Unfortunately, attendance was sparse...Black Swan's protagonist reminded of the disturbed protagonist in Fight Club on many levels. Both are living fragmented, illusion-based realities that they manage to overcome to reach the pinnacle of their self-destructive achievements. While comparing the Black Swan role to Project Mayhem may be a stretch, this movie gives Swan Lake a whole new, visceral, edge.Natalie Portman makes meek and mild a household name in most movies and she reprises that attitude to its zenith here. Living with an overbearing mother, Nina Sayers (her role) desperately attempts to climb the rungs of her dance studio...stealing from the past, guarding against the present and forsaking the future for her complete immersion into the dual role of White Swan and Black Swan. The Black Swan eludes her until she loses herself in lust with her rival Lily, shipped in from California to compete for the role.Many side stories ensue, from the overbearing mother to the small-studio struggles to the prisons of fame, but Nina somehow keeps her fragmenting mind alive for a bravura performance. We slowly see her, literally, transforming into the Black Swan, pulling illusory feathers from her back and standing up to home and studio to achieve perfection. It isn't an easy ride as her fragile confidence meets relenting pressure and results in a boiling point finale where she becomes the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself?Portman carries the movie, but her supporting cast, like the lithe ballet crew that surround her, make it an incredible and memorable journey. Who knew ballet could be surrounded by a psychologically taut and at times disqueting aura?Simply wonderful, see it at once!",10,8,17,18 December 2010
Memento," Innovative, kinetic thriller about one man's Memory Lane.
","Memento, it's like two movies in one that meet in the middle for the story-altering climax.Guy Pearce plays Leanord Shelby, an insurance claims investigator that suffers a rare form of amnesia that recalls the last 10 minutes of events on top of previously learned experiences after he and his wife are the victims of a burglary. Our story starts at the end of the story and moves back (forward?) to the beginning, along the way we meet a cast of eclectic characters including nominal police officer Teddy Gammell, a bartender called Natalie and a host of peripheral characters.Since Leonard can't form deep memories, he uses tattoos to remember names and opinions on those he meets. Teddy isn't to be believed at all while Natalie helps him out of pity, for example. Inevitable, however, those around him take advantage of this situation by using him for their own ends. Natalie drives Leonard into a frenzy where he strikes her then waits outside for 20 minutes and reconstructs the incident into a situation to suit her own purposes, sending Leonard on a goose chase. Brilliant! Through the flashbacks we also see a couple afflicted with the same disease, where the husband cannot learn through practice but is denied a claim until his wife repeatedly asks him for a diabetes shot, which he repeats over and over and over until she passes away. We start seeing this couple as an extension of Leonard's own, especially when we see him giving her the same kind of shot! In the end, both halves of the movie collide and we witness the burglary, the assault on both of them and Teddy's role in the whole thing. Memento leaves your disoriented but yearning for the next piece of information that might give you the whole story, a story incomplete not through poor work by the writers, but rather because of one man's faulty recollections.See it once at least just for the novelty and talking points.",8,0,2,30 June 2012
Captain Marvel," Underused Larson makes the best of what she has.
","To begin, I am not a diehard Marvel Universe viewer. I will go when the characters seem interesting, and the niche Ms. Marvel/Captain Marvel seemed like a good prelude to Avengers: Endgame.We begin by seeing 'Vers' on planet Haula, where they are embroiled in a war with the Skrulls. Little does Vers know that she is being played, and that the Kree are the aggressors in this fight. She has immense powers but lacks focus.
How did she get here? We find out with a nice origin story where she falls from space onto...a Blockbuster Video, incinerating a 'True Lies' mockup poster.
This segment is one of the strongest, as it affords part of the audience a good dose of nostalgia and introduces Fury (Nick, but call him Fury...) played by a quite palatable Samuel L. Jackson. The Skrulls arrive, and they can morph anyone's appearance, which leads to a hilarious train fight.Moving on, we find out that Carol Danvers' ('Vers' origin) was a test pilot for a faster-than-light prototyle that Mar-Vell (her pilot trainer on Earth) was testing to save the Skrulls. In between is a lot of treachery, some amusing cat scenes and some fine interaction with her co-pilot of then Rambeau.It holds together well, but works best when Brie is given some nice one-liners or is a fish out of water on Earth. Hopefully we see a bit more of Captain Marvel in the future, because her powers are quite simply on a galactic scale, and she feels like she needs a much, much larger endgame to shine.",7,2,6,26 April 2019
Spider-Man 3," The 'Me Decade' has found its heroes.
","Spider-Man 3 is a film with its moments, both in action and script.However, the parties involved all come off as self-obsessed, either for the careers, personal lives or whatnot to notice what is really going on around them. Now...I realize we ALL are to a degree, what with our life being the most important in some respect, but when Spider-Man fails to come off as 'heroic' and can't see obvious warning signs you have to wonder.Bruce Campbell is a shining light in this one as the Maitre D'...offering some sorely needed comic relief and spark to a film that has too few great moments of pathos.One of these, however, is the transformation of a thug into the Sandman. Running from the police after a robbery, he leaps into a pit where testing is going to happen. The scientists are oblivious to human presence and thus our villain becomes disintegrated into the sand. His first reactions after this are touching.Spider-Man's transformation into Venom and his subsequent machismo is at times frightening and at times laughable (when he struts in the street for example, or tries to be a ladies man).Eventually he cooperates with the Green Goblin's son to bring down a greater foe.A good movie, but not a GREAT movie as Spider-Man 2 was.",7,1,2,18 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The weakest of the original trilogy.
","In contrast to the prequels, the original series sees the 3rd installment to be the weakest of the bunch. After Darth Vader's dramatic revelations and the remarkable battle on Hoth, we delve into quieter, but not necessarily better times.Certainly the scenes of Han's rescue and the epic space battles are there, but they are peppered with the hideously annoying Ewoks, who take the film from a classic, almost serious endeavour to the domain of the cutesy. Certainly Lucas could have placed a more dignified race rather than one that worships C-3PO? O_o That quibble aside, however, ROTJ has plenty of classic moments, including the climactic assault on the incomplete Death Star, the duel between Vader and the Emperor, and also the scenes on Tattooine.A GOOD film, but not an EXCELLENT film like the first two.",7,3,5,22 May 2005
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Gripping, humorous exploration of grief and score-settlement.
","2017 has been a banner year for movies, from Dunkirk to the outré 'mother!' to this movie to...Oscar voters will have their work cut out for them. 'Three Billboards...' should get a nod for Best Picture, Best Actor (MacDormand), Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell) and so on. Enough about the awards though, this film simply delivers.It delivers a gut punch from the moment you empathize with Mildred (MacDormand) and her unending grief over losing her daughter in a heinous manner and the local constabulary's inability (or is it unwillingness?) to solve the case. Ebbing is a small town, everyone is comfortable. The deputy, played to an intolerant 'T' by Sam Rockwell, throws his weight around and no one says much because the police has an overlarge presence here. Mildred rents three signs outside an access road to town with provocative slogans, one of them calling attention to the crime, the others aiming full-force at Sheriff Willoughby (Harrelson). Willoughby is dying of cancer, and the town rallies around him, rather than the angry and grieving mother. This division sets the stage for some great repartee, as Mildred takes everyone down, from the sheriff to the town pastor to the deputy to various locals.We come to a moment where closure might be expected, but instead it's just another loose end that gets pursued by Mildred and the deputy. 'Three Billboards' drowns us in pathos, chokes us in anger and helps us understands the dynamics of small town America. See it now before the buzz creates lineups.",9,3,9,29 November 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," Kinetic romp through the fashion industry delivers!
","If you like fashion, if you like women (and/or men) dressing up in the best fashions, then see this movie. If you'd like a hilarious, quick-paced romp then listen and watch closely as the movie is full of twists and turns.Andi Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a struggling writer that gets hired to Runway magazine by the 'Dragon Lady' herself, Miranda Priestley. Miranda wants her Starbucks piping hot, her clothes iron, her calls fielded, her needs and whims attended to, much to the dismay of Emily, Andi's co-worker trying to juggle Andi and Miranda. Merryl Streep is fantastic in this one; you can see she relishes being an acerbic fashion broker and you can spot the slightest hint of a smile on her face as she sends Andi on yet another fool's errand.Sandwiched between the world of high fashion and the demands of Runway is Andi's relationship with longtime flame Nate, who starts losing patience with playing second fiddle to Runway. We see more evidence of the demands as very few in the office are married or in a relationship. Miranda is married, with two daughters, but she becomes divorced late in the movie. Andi loses her relationship with Nate, has a fling with Thomas (an editor and fashion guru) which disintegrates quickly. Quite simply, no one has time for sitting down and talking, life is too quick.Outside of the bravura acting from all involved, we get some excellent shots of Paris, New York and various fashion galas. It's almost a blur but ends in a brisk two hours or so. A fair warning though, the ending is fairly contrived but does not deter from the overall feel of the movie.",8,0,0,4 July 2015
The Godfather: Part II," No man is an island...excepting Michael Corleone.
","The Godfather Part II is a tale of two cities, New York at the turn of the 20th century and mid century Lake Tahoe where Vito and Michael Corleone's stories unfold. Much less violent than its predecessor, Part II focuses on Michael's abandonment by family, friends and eventual retreat into himself.Our feature starts in Sicily them moves to New York, focusing on young Vito Corleone and his orphaned youth. He's said to be 'dumb' because he never expresses himself, but you can see his furtive eyes observing everything and his open ears listening to every detail. Vito leaves Sicily orphaned and bereft of siblings, all of them dead at the hands of the local mob boss. He makes a new life for himself in New York, raising a family and overtaking a mob lord with quick wit and a quicker trigger finger. These scenes in 1910ish New York are superb, from the theatre to the grandiosity of the mob to the rigours of health in that area (Fredo is born with Pneumonia, for example) but our future Godfather survives it all, to his credit.In present day Michael tries to solidify his empire through backroom deals, treachery and the disintegration of his family unit and friends. With Hyman Roth (a Florida mobster), he makes inroads into fertile Cuba but he and his family almost perish in a hit at his own home. Everyone turns on Michael, from a jealous Fredo (older brother given no responsibility) to an estranged Kay (who aborts his second son as she doesn't want to contribute to the mob nightmare any longer) to his mob associates. The only one who comes close to 'redeeming' himself is Frank Pentangeli , the key witness for a Senate Investigating Committee into the Corleone's business who recants on the stand when a long-lost brother appears at the tribunal.In the end, Michael is alone with his son Anthony while Kay and their daughter is gone, Fredo dead, the mob dispersed and the Corleone clan expanding from Vegas to Cuba to Tahoe to who knows where...this chapter is excellent, even surpassing the original in some spots in character development and analysis. Recommend highly, but see The Godfather first.",9,0,2,27 May 2012
North by Northwest," A rollicking, mind bending thriller!
","Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an ad exec that gets kidnapped and then...mayhem ensues. Was he kidnapped? Was he drunk? Whom did he allegedly assassinate? What the blue blazes is going on anyway? Everything develops so swiftly in North by Northwest that you'll want to pay attention to everything, from facial expressions to rooms to the various actors and settings as if you stray for a moment, you may well lose touch as the lovely Eva Marie Saint nearly does at the end.Right, back to Roger. He gets in a car, goes to a meeting, excuses himself to make a phone call and is abducted and taken to an estate, where he's accused of being someone else. He protests (vainly) and is then forced to drink down until drunkenness and nearly run off a cliff before taking the wheel itself; at this point one starts wondering if Grant would have done a passable 007, but I digress...Thornhill spends the rest of the movie on the lam, running from the police after being mistaken for an assassin at the United Nations and mistaken for an CIA decoy as well. It all comes to a head when he meets the lovely (and treacherous)Eva Marie Saint as Eve, who is also more than she appears. We find out the whole thing circles around the slippery van Demme and...a finale at Mount Rushmore that will leave you holding your breath and hoping the best for our protagonists while secretly wishing for the worst, just to see if Hitchcock would go there.North by Northwest languished in the pile of classics we go through on Fridays until we had a yearning for a Cary Grant flick. This is much more though; it is a movie that makes your brain come alive, leads you to self-doubt while having the adrenaline pump through you, especially in the fields of Dakota. Simply a brilliant film, even when Thornhill starts catching on about halfway through the movie. Watch for Alfred Hitchcock's inevitable cameo at the start of the movie. This time you can't miss him and nor should you miss this movie.",10,2,5,17 May 2015
Apocalypse Now," Disintegration of mind and soul? Welcome to Vietnam boys...
","Apocalypse Now is long, at times overwrought but it delivers in its examination of the corruption of the soul and mind within an extended stay in a war zone. In our case, the war zone is in Vietnam and Captain Willard has one last mission: find the elusive and dangerous Kurtz and terminate him. How he gets there (in Cambodia) is half the fun.Our protagonist lies in a hotel room, slowly self-destructing in a love-hate mind train of his war experiences. The propellers of the ceiling fan recall helicopter rotors and some officers save him from himself by sending him on one last mission...The trip isn't half the fun in this movie, it's ALL the fun as Willard and his eclectic crew of Chef (a saucier from Louisiana) Lance (surfer from California), Chief Phillips and Tyrone all make their way to Cambodia. Willard meets an absolutely eclectic cast along the way, none more so than Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, a cowboy that orders his squad to surf in the middle of a firefight before letting out 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning!' as he fries a plantation.The deeper our foursome get into enemy territory, the deeper they sink into mistrust, insanity and hair-trigger violence. They are briefly saved by a USO show featuring Playboy bunnies but ultimately collapse well before meeting Kurtz. An unneeded boarding of a civilian boat ends with its crew dead and a small puppy adopted by Lance as the only survivor. Willard shoots the last passenger, a middle-aged woman, with the warning he told them not to stop. As the trek deeper they lose two crew members to native arrows and when they find Kurtz's tribe only Chef, Lance and Willard remain. Chef is ordered to call an airstrike if Willard doesn't return by 22:00 but he'll never have that chance as Kurtz has his head delivered to a captive Willard later on.The final segment, while otherwise strong, is ruined by an overwrought Dennis Hopper and his flaky hippie mantras. If they had cut a few of these scenes and focused more on the natives and their feelings on Kurtz, the movie might have gained...Kurtz himself is now a pseudo-philosopher mixing The Golden Bough with The Bible and his army know-how to hold the tribe captive. No one attempts anything since Kurtz has so much charisma (think Jim Jones) that his word is law. Willard does eventually dispose of him and the words 'The horror! The horror!' echo from Kurtz's mouth as Willard parts the tribe and return to the boat, his face in native paint and irrevocably changed. We know when he closes the radio comm that this is the end for him and Lance, they will either become the new lords or will end up dead. Unfortunately, their minds and hearts are broken beyond repair.Is this an accurate depiction of the Vietman war? Couldn't tell you. Coppola said it was and in either case, this is essential viewing for anyone that wants to witness the internal changes of combatants, especially in the oppressive confines of Vietnam's jungles.",9,0,1,17 June 2012
Dunkirk," Nerve-wracking dissertation on military washout.
","Dunkirk pulls few punches while bringing us a clean look at a disastrous military event. We find Tom (Fionn Whitehead), Alex (Harry Styles) and a handful of other young men trapped on the sea while Germans mercilessly pound the surf, bombard their position and decimate their ranks. Dozens of them piled into freighters, buffeted by waves and hope and despair, and few of them will ever return to their homes.Tension is ratcheted up by the incessant ticking of a watch, reminding us there are scant hours left before the next outbound ship or strike. The Germans are seldom seen; we hear of them planning, we seem them in planes in glorious dogfights with the Brits and we know they are the hammer that will drop, inexorably and mercilessly, on the assembled masses below. The aerial fight sequences are masterfully shot, with bullets ripping the air and the planes painstakingly recreated to give us a real idea of those sequences.One of the few downsides of the movie lies in its limited character development. We see the effects and results of war, but little is known about the featured soldiers outside of their current projects and a bit on their families. We see their prejudices emerge when they have to make choices on how can leave or enter their holds, however, and those moments are enrapturing.Dunkirk scores high as a war movie. To miss it is to miss story writ large, even if that story has dire consequences for all involved.",9,1,7,15 November 2017
The Exorcist," Simply not as scary in our modern age.
","Though I am a Christian, I could not even get a chill out of this movie. It seems quaint to see many of the scenes of possession such as Regan masturbating with the crucifix and the classic pea soup scene.Where the movie gains much is its use of subtext and implied resources, wherein Father Merrin's past weighs heavily on him and ultimately hinders his battle with Pazuzu. Also, Regan's family being divorced is also obviously a nod to her behaviour.Today, this movie is not so jarring and scary, but it remains a classic.6/10",6,0,3,7 June 2005
American History X," Uneven film with a strong message on racism.
","American History X is a star-studded film whose message about racism hits you at a visceral level, but ultimately seems like an after school television special with its characterizations.We're in California a few years after the Rodney King riots and incidents. Ed Norton is Derek Vinyard, a tough-talking skinhead and his brother Danny is getting drowned in the maelstrom of hate. Derek's room has posters of Hitler and other white supremacist tokens and he has a swastika tattooed across his back; he's crossed that line and there is no coming back, or so we think...Sadly uneven, American History X could have been much more. Blacks in the picture are shown as either neutral (playing basketball and hanging out) or criminal or almost subservient. It isn't until Derek is in jail that we say an African American with depth and by that time we would really have liked another one with depth. The prison scenes are some of the best in the movie, with Derek being violated after he didn't pay for protection and his isolation from the other white supremacists finally does him in.Derek finds redemption in prison and tries to save Danny from the jaws of fellow skinheads but it all unravels for the family when he breaks up with his girlfriend, tells off Stacy Keach (the skinhead leader) and pulls Danny out, not a minute too soon. Seeing them tear down their propaganda and turn over a new leaf is as uplifting as Danny's murder at the end is disheartening. In the end, American History X teaches us that violence begets violence and that while you can change yourself you may never be able to change your environment.Sadly, the movie could used another half hour or so to show the other side of the coin, a side that was never explored until the prison scenes.",7,1,2,11 June 2012
Gone with the Wind," An all-time great, Civil War and all.
","It's rare for a movie to earn a 10 in these quarters, but the scope and breadth of Gone With the Wind earn it top marks in virtually every category.Vivian Leigh shines as the selfish, spoiled Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable is her perfect foil as the suave and dangerous Rhett Butler. Our story begins in 1861 on the O'Hara farm, where Scarlett pines for Ashley, who is about to marry her cousin Melanie. She loves Ashley and is indifferent to her cousin. Wanting to be the centre of attention, Vivian heads to the Twelve Oaks barbecue where she throws men away as so many kerchiefs. She eventually confronts Ashley in the library and he rebuffs her, to her anger and to Rhett Butler's unending amusement. Rhett had been hiding behind a couch and starts his dance of seduction with Scarlett.As the movie progresses, we see Georgia embroiled in the progressing Civil War. Atlanta burns (impressively!) and the homestead of Tara is razed and barely able to produce the food necessary for its subsistence. The carpetbaggers take over, Scarlett is forced to sell the mill and to seek Rhett for money to pay the usurious taxes. Meanwhile, Melanie has a child, Ashley dodges more advances from Scarlett and Scarlett's emotionless marriage to a suitor prior ends as he is killed in action. It all leads to a climax where Scarlett and Rhett wed, their wills clash and he kidnaps their daughter, their poor daughter who dies riding a horse sidesaddle, and their next child is stillborn after Rhett and Scarlett argue on the stairs of Tara. Rhett's famous line: 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!' resonates his frustration and we see a broken but ultimately self-delusional and hopeful Scarlett looking forward to tomorrow.All that said, the treatment of African American slaves is polished to a grotesque degree and at least merits some consideration. They are all shown as happy and servile and Ashley and others referencing them as 'Darkies' does the movie a disservice, even if it may have been more accurate than the other portrayals.All said though, this is an epic romance and one that stands the test of time.",10,9,16,13 July 2015
This Is Spinal Tap," 9 out of 10 for this hilarious send-up
","Believe it or not, I saw this for the first time tonight and it had me in stitches from the opening video of 'Bitch School' to the three of them trying to get on range for 'Heartbreak Hotel' (God was this on the ball, I remember trying to hit octaves myself in my singing days).It really encapsulated quite well the sort of rock bands we saw in the 80s, the huge hair, decadent, masturbatory guitar solos and here now gone tomorrow thing still so true of today's music as well.So many elements ring true as well: The intruding girlfriend/boyfriend (Hello Yoko Ono), the petty squabbles, the ass-kissing A&R guys who don't do their jobs properly, and the total excess of bands. I was in stitches when Nigel was showing off his guitars and one was untouched and NO ONE could touch it. It's so funny because I have musician friends that are just like that.And the 18' Stonehenge...classic and unrepeated.A great movie with biting commentary and humour as well.Gave it a 9 because it could have been much longer, at least a half-hour more.",9,0,3,14 January 2005
The Shape of Water," Love, like water, has a mutable shape.
","The Shape of Water is Guillermo del Toro's latest epic. We follow Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute cleaning assistant and her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) as they work deep within a military facility in Cold War United States. Of interest in this facility is 'The Asset', an amphibian creature of deep intelligence and equally deep ferocity. Its captor, Strickland, is an unfeeling sadist who cannot love but can control and torment. He simply wants a promotion from his military superiors and tortures The Asset at every turn.Thankfully for the Asset, he is discovered by Eliza, who befriends him and helps him escape to her apartment space, which she shares with Giles, an advertising cartoonist who is falling behind the times, as photography is taking over at present. Giles and Eliza communicate well and he helps her store our amphibian friend, and ultimately befriend and save it. The Shape of Water offers much beyond the story, however. It is a visual treat, the interior of the mysterious facility rendered with a remarkable sterility, Giles' apartment comfortable and replete with a bachelor's sundries. References to Soviet spies abound, and one is in fact an integral part of the story.See the Shape of Water for its brilliant acting, fine special effects and perhaps even to regain hope for love between differences.",8,41,75,24 February 2018
Zombieland," Rule 0: See Zombieland for a great time out
","My best friend and I were looking for something to do on a Saturday and settled on Zombieland. We weren't disappointed and neither will you.The movie starts auspiciously with the US Capitol overrun by zombies. Some slight background is given; a Patient Zero developed a disease that swelled the brain and turned him savage, the disease spread and zombies erupted everywhere.One of the last survivors is the neurotic Columbus, Ohio...a geek to whom many of us can empathize. Soon joining him is the acerbic redneck Tallahassee a man in search of a Twinkie and with a penchant for firearms. A straight shooter in all senses of the phrase. While you'd expect a movie like this to border on camp, it has its definite serious moments, especially when Wichita and Little Rock enter the picture. The scenes of zombie carnage are worth it in and of themselves, especially the grocery store outing and the stress relief at the souvenir store, where the survivors rediscovery some innocence and youth.There's a great cameo toward the end of the movie as well, which I won't spoil here. Overall, this is a fantastic bit of popcorn-munching fun. No great insights here, I'm afraid, outside of the ability of diverse people to cooperate in times of need. But it's one nice stretch of zombie exploding good times!",8,0,1,8 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A swashbuckling end to the beginning of Star Wars...
","This movie was simply outstanding. Despite some occasionally wooden dialogue, everything came together to set up the next 3 movies...Ian McDiarmid was brilliant as the coldly manipulative Palpatine, playing on Anakin's fears and desires to make him his personal tool and trap him in the Dark Side of the Force.Natalie Portman is stunning, but is short-shrifted this time around, as we have seen her more active and interested in previous movies.The battle scenes, replete with the usual CGI effects, are all excellent, especially the first lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and General Grievous, and the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan.Fantastic summer fare, best of the prequels, worth of the name Star Wars.",10,1,6,19 May 2005
Mother!," Allegorical, jarring and bound to be divisive.
","Paramount Pictures deserves to be panned (and roundly) for advertising this as some sort of home invasion horror flick, as it is nothing of the sort. Our showing here in Gloucester had a sparse crowd of about 70 or so people, which works out to its poor box office returns.The film itself is a huge religious and environmental allegory. Javier Bardem is 'Him', the creative force stalled and wed to 'Mother', the world gifted to him and currently barren, as she has to fuel his creation through inspiration. Him needs outside inspiration as well, and this is where Man begets Woman, and so on. It comes off as slightly pretentious, but it does work. We move through early biblical works and side warnings about humans lacking care for the environment, and then sashay into various commentaries about fame, fandom overrunning celebrities, people in general being callous and selfish and so on.'mother!' takes a hard turn in its last segment, but you have been warned when Mother says she is going to 'prepare for the Apocalypse', and that's what you get, in all its horror, violence, selfishness and degradation. Eventually Mother (Earth, Nature), is pushed to her limits and burns the whole area down, only to be rebuilt.I gave this film a 7 for its use of sound (no music anywhere, just ambient sounds and natural sounds) and Bardem playing the creative, selfish force to a tee. Lawrence is an observant force, trying to preserve herself and ultimately vengeful when people destroy everything carelessly. The final sequence is absolutely incredible, covering everything from Abu Ghraib to refugees to riots to wars to dark religiosity and so on.That said, this is NOT a movie that should have been released to the masses, but instead given a small, art house release. It was mislabelled and there is simply too much going on here to serve as popcorn fodder. On this point, I often felt as I was the only EATING popcorn from my high perch in the theater, and the sound was intrusive on the surroundings. Yes, really. See this movie with an open mind, bear in mind its intense religious allegories and go from there.",7,5,13,17 September 2017
Casino Royale," Craig IS Bond, bravo!
","It is always with some trepidation that one approaches a new Bond film. Lately they have degenerated into facile acting, cheap gimmicks and crazy plots.However, Casino Royale reboots the Bond series in style. Though overly long at points, Craig puts his stamp on the role early and shows great ruthlessness and a cool aplomb as well. However, he is not perfect as his arrogance and emotion get the best of him many times.Mads Mikkelsen is excellent as Le Chiffre and makes a poker game stand out and be an interesting setting even for non-adepts of the game. Eva Green shines as Vesper Lynd, more than Bond's intellectual equal though she proves as so many women in this series, disposable.Caterina Murino is incredibly sensual and it's with women like her in Bond series that you wish some could have recurring roles as love interests and active partners.The tone of the movie is quite gritty and refers to terrorism and the post 9-11 world more than once. Gone are the SMERSH agents, Blofeld and conspiracies of the past; now it's Bond against subversive elements and it works.Gave it only a 8 out of 10 because I missed Q and it was overly long.",8,2,4,23 November 2006
Amélie," As Charming and Indefatigable as the French can be!
","I had seen snippets of 'Amélie' on TV but had long wanted to see the whole thing...a summer project of the IMDb 250 led us to France for this wonderful story.Amélie is nominally about a young woman in Paris (?) who is looking for love, adventure and mostly a friend. In the end, it is about overcoming your internal shyness, bringing hope and joy to others and a bizarre, eclectic cast of characters that have their lives changed by this remarkable young woman.It all starts at birth, or should I say conception for our heroine who is homebound because of a misdiagnosis by her father (She has a weak heart he says...) but moves out and then has her mind wander and her heart even more. She eventually finds a kindred soul in an eclectic collector of discarded photographs (from those old photo booths) and they play cat and mouse until he is tantalizingly close at her café, but she lets him slip away, collapsing in tears.Eventually Amélie does get her man, thanks to a push from her downstairs neighbour, but not before we get some hyper-kinetic chases through the city, some great characters including an irascible vegetable stand owner who gets his by our sly heroine (shaving foam replaced, shoes displaced, alarm clock changed...) and you just cannot stop laughing and hoping for everyone in this bizarre neighbourhood.If you are down in the dumps, depressed or in need of some hope then get Amélie. She will put a smile on your face, that is for sure!",9,1,4,5 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A fine reboot of the Star Wars franchise.
","When it comes to the Star Wars franchise, it's vital to take a step back to see what has been delivered to us. In this case, it's fine swashbuckler with some minor flaws. The temptation here (and I have fallen into it) is to see the characters as transpositions of the original. Rey is Luke, Finn is Han, Kylo is a budding Vader and so on.The Force Awakens loses nothing of the original trilogy's grandiose scale. Jakku is a desert planet in the vein of Tatooine, the First Order is a reboot of the Empire, sharing its original goals of galactic domination and there are the same cheeky references to the original series as well. Fans that are enamoured with the Star Wars galaxy will be let down as the film has its flaws. Han Solo dies an inglorious death at the hands of his son, but we have the pleasure of seeing Rey grow from a scavenger to a budding Jedi Knight. Finn is a little harder to corner here. He has some great lines but could have used some expository depth outside of 'Hey, I'm a former trooper and I'm getting the hell out!' but that will surely come in the rest of the new trilogy.TFA rewards fans of the original series by showing us Han, Leia, Chewie, C3PO, R2 and finally Luke in a final moment that has all of the mentor-student tableau we've seen before. There isn't a lot of CGI here weighing down the movie, and that aids it a great deal. Should we have expected more? Perhaps. We are left with a tantalizing possible future though. The young padawan ready to face more threats, the unwilling hero trying to find his space, torches being passed from past heroes to new ones. It's by no means perfect, but it's a fine two hours of entertainment, heroism and worth a look or two. If Abrams tightens up the script a little in the next movies, we'll have a great run here as well.",7,1,16,27 December 2015
Rear Window," Frothy and charming whodunit has it all...
","As my best friend and I make our way down IMDb's top 250, Rear Window 'reared' its head at us. We had no idea what to expect as our exposure to that era was quite limited. We were not disappointed, however...Jimmy Stewart is fantastic as the wheelchair-bound photographer warding off the advances of the radiant and persuasive Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) as he recovers from a broken leg and engulfs himself in observing (spying?) on his neighbours. Soon enough he manages to convince Lisa that he's witnessed a potential murder and both of them try to solve it, culminating in Lisa sneaking into Thorwald's apartment to find the deceased wife's wedding ring (No wife would go without her ring unless she were dead...) and it all comes to a dramatic conclusion with some inadvertent humour thrown in as Lisa gets arrested in her home invasion but has a scant fifty cents in her purse (Socialites living off others' good graces...) and Stewart breaks his OTHER leg in the final confrontation, leaving a wry Grace Kelly at his bedside (not a bad way to go if you ask me. :) ) Excellent film, especially in its use of zoom and focus on the apartment dwellers supplemented by a quirky cast of characters that will leave you laughing and shaking your head at the same time.",9,0,1,12 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Swashbuckling space fun!
","I saw this film for the first time oh it must be well over 20 years ago in the theatric with mom & dad...boy was it impressive! Even now, decades later, it's STILL great fun, innocent fun, white hats vs. black hats on a grandiose spatial scale.Who can forget Darth Vader, one of cinema's most iconic villains, and the rest of the cast...the rogue Solo, the assertive Leia, the towering Chewie, the starry-eyed Luke who is possessed of the Force.So many others in supporting roles, incredible special effects for its time.A classic! The final scene of the Death Star exploding will echo always in my memory.",10,2,3,20 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Darker, grittier, romantic, the best Star Wars!
","This is in my mind the best Star Wars...Whereas the first is called 'A New Hope' this one could be subbed 'Without Hope, We Survive'.The rebels are on the ice world of Hoth, re-assembling while Vader relentlessly hunts after them. The relationship between Leia and Han grows into friendship and romance, Luke discovers Yoda for the first time and that classic line from Vader: 'Luke! I am your father!' It's so clichÃ© now but I recall way back when the newspapers were full of this line, that we would discover Vader was someone's father, such a huge buzz! The new sites were wonderful as well...Bespin, Hoth, Dagobah, space itself...star destroyers, bounty hunters.A great, dark, gritty addition to the Star Wars family. One that places itself at the top of the 6 movies, followed closely by Revenge of the Sith for its darkness and at the same time, hope.",10,0,1,20 May 2005
The Simpsons Movie," A 2-hour Simpsons episode...and it works!
","Dubious as I was that the Simpsons could sustain pace and humour for an extended run a theatre, overjoyed I was to see myself proved wrong.The Simpsons movie starts out irreverent and ends up doing the right thing, all along taking shots at the environmental movement, the EPA and society in general.Homer is still laughably moronic with a big heart and his family and Springfield suffer the consequences of his gluttony as he dumps a container of pig slop into the nearby lake.Schwarzenegger as President was classic 'I'm a leader, not a reader!' and the film, even in its quiet moments, had good pacing.Is it Schindler's List or Fight Club or Judgment at Nuremberg? No, of course not.It's still one of the best films of this year and a top-notch comedy. Pay your money, get your snacks, put your brain into park and go see it.",6,3,8,2 August 2007
The Godfather," When humanity takes a back seat to the business, you have The Godfather.
","Once again delving into IMDb's Top 250, we come upon The Godfather. Long since clichéd in its use of 'Offer you can't refuse', the horse incident and its view of the mafia, Godfather remains compelling 40 years after its release.Vito Corleone is on his last legs. As he enjoys his daughter's wedding, the cesspool of mafiosi politicking makes hay behind his back as his sons vie for control of the family and a monopoly over their section of New York. We see the brutality and efficiency of said underworld at is pinnacle when Corleone convinces a movie producer to give a friend of his a part by beheading his prize horse and leaving the 'note' in his bed. Any attempt at normalcy is doomed as families are torn apart by violence, secrecy, jealousy and anger as husbands gamble human freight to gain more influence in their inner circles.Marlon Brando is excellent as the Corleone clan's 'eminence grise', who wryly dies of natural causes while one of his sons is gunned down at a toll, ostensibly for his actions toward other clans as well as his wife. Betrayals are repaid with quick deaths and the juxtaposition of Michael in a church forsaking violence and hatred (Satan) while eliminating his rivals in the background is chilling.The epic lasts a good 10 years as we see the evolution of mafia reach from simple prostitution and bribery and gambling to include illicit drugs, somewhat half-heartedly. At the end, Michael Corleone stands alone as Godfather and alone as husband, betraying his wife's trust to keep silent his actions with the Corleone clan. The Godfather is still an epic, sprawling masterpiece that doesn't seem out of date in 2012, scary a thought as that is...",9,1,2,18 May 2012
