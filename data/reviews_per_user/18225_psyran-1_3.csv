Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Idiotic dialog of Kill Bill Vol. II
","Since Quentin Tarantino is now an established motion picture director, it seems that he can now get away with just about ANYTHING! Witness the mind-numbing, jaw-dropping moronic dialog between John Carradine and Uma Thurman at the end of Kill Bill Volume II: Carradine (after being given a death blow by Thurman): Pai-Mei taught you the five-point-palm exploding heart technique! Why didn't you tell me?Thurman: I don't know. I guess I'm just a bad person.Carradine: No, you're not a bad person. You're a g-g-g-g-good person.Does Tarantino PURPOSELY write such hackneyed dialog or is he just merely verbally challenged?",Null,2,4,6 January 2008
American Gangster," Much better than any of this genre preceding it
","I had mixed feelings going into this movie. I had seen the television documentary on Frank Lucas, and wondered how the movie could improve on that. But what a knockout film. During the middle of it, I was worried that it was devolving into a standard drug bust-shootout movie. But the ten minute dialog between Washington and Crowe was mesmerizing. The thrust and parry, each one psychologically circling the other, figuring out the weak points and strengths of the other in deciding how to negotiate with each other, the mutual caginess and respect, was fascinating to watch. Why couldn't the rest of the movie have more of this intelligent, absorbing kind of tete-a-tete?",Null,0,2,23 November 2007
Inception," hodge-podge of nothing but c.g.i. effects
","I have just seen the most ridiculous 'movie' ever made, and I use the term movie quite loosely. Is there no expectation any more that movies should have SOME plot, story, sequentiality, or plausibility, or are they just total indulgences on the part of the director? Rather than watching a compelling, evolving storyline that INVOLVES you and draws you in, instead we witness the work of 18 year-old computer whiz kids in front of their consoles, churning out meaningless, special effects displays. One feels like a bystander on the sidelines, and the experience of watching something like this is both boring and irritating. 'Inception' is the most confused, convoluted, ridiculous assemblage of scenes ever put on the screen. At one point there were simultaneously 1. shots of people underwater in a van that had just gone off a bridge, 2. men shooting each other with machine-guns while skiing, 3. men fighting each other in a hotel hallway while floating in the air defying gravity, and 4. a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio at his house talking to his wife. The camera kept alternating quickly between each scene, but each one had nothing to do with the other. It was like watching a movie preview, with random, unconnected scenes thrown out in rapid succession, meant only to entice you to see the movie. Not only did scenes bear no connection to one another, they also had no relation to the scenes preceding them, and thus there was absolutely no follow-able story line at all. There was nothing but c.g.i. effects meant, I suppose, to 'entertain' us. Do movie makers not realize that special effects, in and of themselves, do not hold one's interest if there is no connection between them and some conceivable storyline? You might as well be watching a cartoon. As with a cartoon, unless you're five years old or brain-impaired, you would become bored within five minutes, because there's no ongoing, developing story demanding your attention.",1,33,131,16 July 2010
