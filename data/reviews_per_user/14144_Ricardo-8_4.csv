Alien 3," Not Alien enough
","First of all, I would like to say that Alien 3 is a good action/thriller. It has suspense, good dialogue and a decent plot. But it isn't a good Alien movie, and because of that it will be unfairly dismissed as 'bad'. Aliens continued logically on from Alien, with a storyline that told us more about Ripley, the company and the creature. But with Alien 3, however, it seemed to hit a brick wall. Yes, the isolated mining facility looked nice, and it did establish a forboding atmosphere, but it didn't have the tension of the first two. In the first two films, it was more the thought of an deadly monster hunting you down than the actual monster itself, but here the Xenomorph seems less deadly, and therefore less frightening. In Alien and Aliens, letting it get anywhere near you was certainly fatal, but here you might as well play fetch with it. I recommend to anyone who has seen Alien and Aliens but hasn't seen Alien 3 yet, that when you do watch it, try and imagine that after Aliens, Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop (the coolest character in the trilogy) were rescued by the Corporation and that the people here are actually not the same people from the first two films, and it's just a coincidence that they have the same names. You'll enjoy Alien 3 a lot more, and it won't depress you every time you see the ending to Aliens knowing that they're all going to die.",7,10,27,6 January 1999
Alien: Resurrection," I'm sorry
","I apologise to David Fincher and all fans of Alien 3 for my moaning in my Alien 3 comments. After witnessing the horror that is Alien Resurrection, I now realise what a good movie Alien 3 was. This movie is so bad I think I need to invent a new word to express how I feel about it. And it gave me a headache too.",3,0,0,6 February 1999
Annie Hall," Excellent
","Probably the best of Woody's romantic comedies. The dialogue, the direction - everything seems perfect. I've seen most of his post-1975 romantic comedies, but this takes the proverbial biscuit. Or lobster.",Null,1,2,16 October 1998
Blade Runner," They just don't get it
","A lot of critics don't seem to get Blade Runner. They think it's just a sci-fi action. How wrong they are. It is the one perfectly-directed movie EVER. The chilling Vangelis music etched into your memory, the surreal yet realistic future San Fransisco city and Harrison Ford's confused detective all make this worthy of the Philip Dick book it was based on. Bonza!",10,0,1,16 October 1998
