Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'Do you call this archaeology??'
","This movie is what we all waited for - an update on adventure-movies like 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', 'The Crimson Pirate' and so on.We have a great hero, played flawlessly by mr. Ford, the utter villains (obviously the nazis) and the quest for the most holy object - the Ark of the Covenant. Who can ask for more??When I started reading SF, Fantasy and adventure-books a lot of years ago, I didn't think that movies could create the same pictures in my mind as the books, but in this instance I was clearly wrong. Though movie-technology has moved ahead drastically, there are not so many heavy special-effects here (apart from the Island-scene), It's all in the script! Wonderful.He's not too convincing as an archaeologist, though (I am one).10/10",9,0,1,11 January 2001
Alien," Is this in fact a Science Fiction Movie?
","Don't get me wrong. I love this movie. The sheer beauty of the designs - the 'Nostromo', Giger's work on the Alien, the alien ship etc. all adds to the sheer enjoyment of this movie. I saw it with my father in 1980 on the big screen, and several times we almost fell of our seats. It is horrific! Great stuff.The Point of my summary is this.. without the SF-trappings it would function fine as an excellent horror movie - which is exactly what it is! In my book, technology in SF movies should add something intrinsic to the action that is just not possible today - like in 'Bladerunner' with the replicants etc. In 'Alien' this is just not the case.'Alien' could be a great Brothers Grimm's Tale if you replaced the bad guy with a dragon or some other such monster.The fun part of this film-series is that the movies are so diverse ... a pure horror movie, an action thriller - and a somewhat philosophical thriller. Alas I haven't yet seen #IV, as I got a bit disappointed with #III.Anyway - a great movie by any standard. Well done indeed Mr. Scott!!9/10",Null,0,1,8 January 2001
