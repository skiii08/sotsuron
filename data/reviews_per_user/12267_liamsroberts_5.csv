The Blair Witch Project," Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
","Blair Witch Project is about 3 people, Heather, Josh and Mike, documenting on the 'Blair Witch' a tale well known by the town of Burkittsville. This film was the start of the Found Footage Horror movie genre. They use the found footage technique to try to make the movie more real and in this movie it is used very effectively. Once they first see the weird rock piles I was at the edge of my seat. This in my opinion is horror, it captures the fear of getting lost and knowing that something is watching you at all times. The scariest part of the movie is not knowing what is out there. You never see what is scaring them, you only hear noises and see the characters reactions and it adds more realism to the movie. But the last 5-10 minutes of the movie are terrifying. Once the words 'There's a house' were said, stuff was gonna go down. Throughout the movie Josh goes missing and Heather and Mike start to go looking for him. They start hearing his voice from an abandoned house and they decide to enter, at night. Mike heads to the bottom floor and finds Josh getting killed by something (off camera) and his camera cuts off. Then it switches to Heather's camera and she heads downstairs. She then sees Mike facing the corner of the room not moving at all. Then Heather's camera is knocked over facing the floor and it ends. The reason Mike was facing the wall was that before they headed into the woods, they were talking to some town locals about the 'Blair Witch' and one of the people said that the when someone sees the witch killing someone, they get put in a corner facing away and then after they get killed. That's what happened to Mike. He saw Josh getting killed so he got put in a corner. And Heather then saw Mike getting killed and so on. I don't think this movie is one of the best or one or over hyped. The camera quality hasn't dated that well in today's time and the films that came after this kind of make you disrespect this movie a little bit. It's really fun horror movie that is fun to watch with a group of friends.",8,0,1,26 October 2017
The Shining," One of the greatest films ever made!
","The Shining is a very special movie. It's one of those movies that make you think for weeks. A way that Kubrick made you think is that he incorporated 'easter eggs', more like hidden plot points, that give this movie a lot more meaning than just a man going crazy and trying to kill his family. Every little detail in this movie has a meaning, like Jack throwing the ball at the native American artwork, the bear-man giving oral sex to another man and blood coming out of an elevator. There are many theories to these 'easter eggs', specifically The Native American Genocide and the incest between Jack and Danny. Throughout the hotel there are native American artworks, and it's saying that there is a connection between the story and the Native American Genocide. Delbert Grady referring to Hallorann as a racial slur like there is a hate between these two sides just like the Americans and the Natives when they first settled in the USA. The hotel is also located on an Indian burial ground, and that during construction they encountered attacks by Natives. Wendy and Hallorann are like the Native Americans. Wendy wears a yellow jacket with native American artwork on it and her hair is completely black, no one else in the movie has completely black hair. There is a shot where Hallorann's head is facing the same way as a native American chief on a food can, and then he gets killed by Jack and his body lands on top of native American artwork. Then there is the incest between Jack and Danny, although it is not very clear. Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony. He developed Tony after he had an 'accident' with his father where Jack pulled Danny and dislocated his shoulder. Then in the movie Jack always gives Danny weird looks at him, long creepy looks. There is still no final answer to this movie, and sometimes its best to leave things unanswered. As a movie, I think it's a masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing with the tracking shots, the acting is phenomenal, especially Jack Nicholson, and the ending is one of the creepiest endings to a movie. It is definitely a classic and it still stands the test of time. The fact that this movie, a 37 year old movie, still hasn't been fully answered blows my mind.",10,1,3,7 November 2017
Get Out," A Great Debut Film
","This film is a great example of a debut film. The director and writer of this film, Jordan Peele, originally worked on the show Key and Peele that was a sketch comedy show, so this film was big step for his career and I won't be surprised to see more of him in the future. What makes this film stand out is the take on the subject. It is a subject that many movies focus on but the way that this film presents it makes this film different. The lead performance by Daniel Kaluuya is excellent. It is a very subtle performance and when you learn about his backstory you really latch on to him, which is why the ending is a very satisfying end. The side performances by Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford and LilRel Howery are also very good. This film also has small details that you don't get the first time you see the film. Like the main theme of the film is sung in a different language but translate to lyrics like 'Brother, listen to the ancestors, run!'. Or when Chris and Rose are talking to a police officer and when the officer asks to see Chris' ID Rose rejects the officer so that she doesn't get questioned after they find out that Chris has gone missing. There is also an alternate ending to this film where the police arrive instead of Rod and so he gets arrested. Then it cuts to 6 months later and Rod visits Chris at the prison that is in. When Rod talks to Chris about how there is not evidence, Chris responds 'I'm good, I stopped it.' What he means is that he stopped his inner demon from overtaking him when he hit Georgina with the car. He didn't do nothing, instead he went out and took her into the car. He also tells Rod to stop asking him about the incident at the Armitage's house. I actually like this ending more than the theatrical ending, it gives you a feel of catharsis where the other ending, which is also very good, is a more happy ending where Rod picks up Chris on the road. My only issue with this movie is that there are times where it goes from a comedic tone to a very serious tone very quickly at times. Like at the end where Rod gets Chris and the thing that he says is for comedy, and I wish he acted more serious because Chris was just shot at, witnessed a suicide and tried to choke his former girlfriend. Other than that this movie is great and I wish I had seen it back when it was in theatres.",9,24,49,12 January 2018
The Artist," Aging like fine wine.
","I first saw The Artist back when it came out in 2011. I was only 9 then but was still able to enjoy the visuals and how it's a silent film that was made in the 21st century. But after seeing it 7 years later I was very pleased by how good it came out to be. I did not realize that it was about the transition from silent films to 'talkies', and how it affects silent film stars. This film also has a lot of connections to other films, in specific Sunset Boulevard, which also deals with the transition from silent films to talkies. The performances in the movie are all full of heart and soul and are very believable, especially Jean Dujardin who plays as the lead character. It's very sad to see the two main actors in this movie to not be in big movies that come out today, but that happens. I just want to recognize the performance by the dog Uggie who plays as the main character's dog, it's one of the best animal performances I've ever seen. But what this has going for it is how it is going to age in the future.",9,4,9,28 November 2018
The Disaster Artist," The Dumb Genius
","The Room is considered to be the 'Best worst movie ever' and was created by a man no one knew, Tommy Wiseau. James Franco plays as this unkown character in the best way he could. He made him sympathetic and sometimes very broken. Dave Franco plays as Greg Sestero, Tommy's best friend and working colleague. And he as well gives a great performance with a lot of emotion. But why would James Franco direct, produce and act in a movie about a movie that is so bad that people like it ? Well it's weird but I think that this movie gives a lot of inspiration. This movie is somewhat an underdog story, a nobody that has a dream and he somewhat succeeds it. This movie honestly made me want to make a movie, it shows that if you put a lot of work into something, it will in time come true. But thankfully, this movie does not rely on you knowing what 'The Room' is. You can go into this movie blind and still really enjoy it. It's not exactly about the making of 'The Room' even though it is, but it's about the people making 'The Room', and they executed it extremely well.",9,1,2,19 April 2018
