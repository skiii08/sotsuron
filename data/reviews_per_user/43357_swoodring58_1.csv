The Monuments Men," egomaniac
","A monument to Clooney's ego, this film has the flavor of 12 directors who don't know each other working from a 'script' written on 50 cocktail napkins by teenagers.It's a joke. There is absolutely no character development, no relation between scenes, improbable if not impossible events and no historical focus. It may be based on a true story, but it doesn't do that story justice.It's a waste of talent, as well. Has the sense of one of those WWII films where there's a Brit, a Frenchman, a Pole, etc. And the Frenchwoman? Only gets pulled in to end the movie...previously she's uncooperative, and we don't really see the change of heart except to assume she's attracted to the Matt Damon character. Cheesy in the extreme.",3,1,1,30 May 2014
