The Legend of Bagger Vance," Good Intentions, but really falls short
","This adaptation of the book is well done in many ways. The casting of the supporting actors, who play Jones & Hagen, as well as the young Hardy, is top notch.Cinematography, etc. is also very well executed.I thought that Damon did a very credible job as Junuh, although his character is a Redford clone, right down to the haircut and whispery delivery of his lines, and Will Smith was surprisingly quite good as Bagger Vance. I must admit when I read the novel I had a hard time imagining Smith playing this part, but he carries it off with Morgan Freeman-esque style.I completely disagree with every reviewer who enjoyed Charlize Theron's performance. Her character is little more than a footnote in the book, and in this film they greatly expanded her role to have a romantic subplot that frankly has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and bogs down the story. Ms. Theron is very beautiful, but her accent is TERRIBLE!!!! Watch her first few scenes with the town elders and tell me how you could ever believe that is a real Georgia accent.Similarly, the young Hardy, who has a much more credible Southern accent, seems to lose it completely by the time he's grown up to become the narrator, Jack Lemmon. Little continuity errors like that drag this film down.All in all, Bagger Vance is not a bad film, but it's not great either.Best suited for golfers and fans of the Great Gatsby.",5,12,25,13 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Terrible script & poor editing make this a poor clone
","I just watched this on DVD last night, having seen it in the theatre. I was very disappointed when I watched the scenes that had been cut, as they fleshed out the story a lot more than the final cut. You learned more about the wasp creatures near the end of the film and why Dooku enlisted their help. Padme's character was a lot more established as well in visits to her parents house and in a confrontation with Dooku.Many people have commented on the wooden acting of the two leads, which I somewhat agree with, but Christensen is not that bad an actor, and neither is Portman. The problem with both this film and Phantom Menace is Lucas' dialogue. He writes lines which no actor, even in a fantasy movie, can say without sounding like they're reading them off of cue cards. This can be excused when the line is SF technobabble, but when it's supposed to be intimate romance it comes off as clumsy, forced, and utterly unbelievable. Considering that we KNOW the ultimate fate of each of these characters, these make scenes where they are put in peril uninteresting, since you already know they'll survive. Lucas really blew the chance at creating highly developed, memorable characters in my opinion.In addition, both this and Phantom Menace sorely miss a solid supporting cast to the two cardboard character leads. Where is the Han Solo/Chewbacca/Lando of these movies? Watching the original trilogy, the chemistry between Han and Chewie gives the movies a much broader appeal than the soap opera Skywalker saga. Imagine the original trilogy with only Luke and Leia as the two main characters -- it'd be far less interesting!!!
Ewan McGregor is given a lot more to do in this film as Obi-Wan, and he acquits himself very well, although I think the scenes on the clone world would have been much better if he had been accompanied by Mace Windu. We almost always see Jedis travel in pairs, until Kenobi's solo visit. Christopher Lee does well in the limited screen time he's given. Samuel L. Jackson gives a one note performance as Mace Windu ... we're never convinced that he's as powerful a warrior as he's said to be. And when a CGI Yoda is the most expressive character in the film, you know something's just not right.Lucas has really painted himself into a corner to deliver the goods in Episode III. In my opinion, to tie up all the loose ends he's created between Phantom Menace and this film, Episode III might have to be 4 hours long.In summary, this is a decent film for fans of the Star Wars saga, and certainly better than Phantom Menace, but it still doesn't break much new ground. Compared to the colorful entertaining space opera of the first trilogy it's rather dull and predictable. Hopefully Episode III will give Star Wars fans a movie that can be held up to the high standards of the originals.",Null,61,120,26 November 2002
Forrest Gump," Preachy, Simplistic, and Sappy
","Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime. This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from Forrest's service in Vietnam all the way through to the 'resolution' with Jenny at the end.With that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through.  I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.
Watch this film and ask yourself 'What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?' Forrest seems to have made the 'right' choices and been at the 'right place at the right time' for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?",4,20,44,8 December 2000
Armageddon," Terrible
","I just saw this film last night and it is SO bad in SO many ways.  It takes the phrase 'suspension of disbelief' to an entirely new level.The plot is 3rd grade gibberish. None of the actors save Billy Bob Thornton create characters that are worth rooting for, or memorable. It was damn near impossible to care about what happened to any of these people, as most of them were stereotype 'summer movie' characters. The relationship between Bruce Willis' tough-guy father and Liv Tyler's stubborn daughter was improbably written and poorly acted. I had a hard time believing that people like those two could even exist, let alone have a relationship like they did.the special effects were good, there were a number of memorable CGI scenes but the editing for this movie was extremely annoying, I TOTALLY agree with the poster who said there are no scenes longer than 3 seconds.I was actually prepared to give this movie a 6 or 7, until the utterly contrived and vomit-inducing ending, which I won't even bother to spoil, anyone who loses 2 and a half hours of their life watching this pile of c**p deserves to see the ending.By the way I usually like Bruce Willis in almost anything, but his performance in this film is one of the most 1-dimensional, flatly uninspired I've ever seen.  Willis seemed to be taking lessons straight from the John Wayne school of acting, delivering even impassioned speeches in a wooden monotone.",4,0,1,10 October 2000
Hellboy," Very disappointing
","Perlman was great...inspired casting there and throughout, but the film bogs down very quickly into a series of CGI fights. Hints of what could have been an exciting plot get smothered into the never ending fight sequences and mediocre, half-realized characterizations. This movie's about a half hour longer than it should have been, and the CGI sequences don't really serve the story that well. Fans of the comic should be satisfied...it isn't a terrible adaptation but as a movie it falls flat. They tried a little too hard with this one to merge the occult backstory with the requisite action/fighting stuff. I'd cut at least one or two of the fights vs the 'hound of destruction' character. By the third fight it got to be serious overkill. I came very close to walking out of this film just because the third act goes absolutely nowhere.",8,0,1,5 April 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Great, if you've got ADD
","This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It would have been better if the editor and director could have let a single shot go on for longer than a second. It's a jumpy addled mess that is derivative of so many songs & movies there isn't a single original thought or idea in this film. Ewan McGregor & Nicole Kidman can sing pretty well, but it's not enough to save this film.Nothing personal intended here, but all you reviewers who say this movie is a masterpiece seriously need your heads checked. The sets & production are astonishing, granted, but seriously, the plot of this film makes Rocky Horror Picture Show look like Citizen Kane.I can understand the 'love it or hate it' comments I'm reading, but how anyone could consider this Best Picture???? Give me a break.",1,4,9,12 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Overrated, pseudo-mystical garbage w/great SFX
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS--This movie was WAY too long. There's like a whole 35-40 minutes of actual story crammed into a two and a half hour long movie...Several characters serve no useful purpose at all whatsoever...Link's wife, was she necessary? What about the councillor and most of the people in Zion? Was there any need to show them in this film? They didn't advance the story at all.In fact all the Zion scenes were a total waste of time, especially the much reviled rave scene, which does nothing but bring the film to a crashing halt for 15 minutes.People who say this film is some kind of deep philosophical triumph just make me laugh....you people must experience religious epiphany reading cereal box ingredients. There's nothing original or groundbreaking about this film at all in terms of its philosophical stance, just a bunch of quasi-deep mumbling by the Architect which in the end amounts to nothing and/or contradicts everything they have said before.Trinity and Neo have no chemistry at all together and are so wooden it's very difficult to care about what happens to them. In the first movie you could actually see them as people instead of some kind of CGI kung fu robot in leather. Fishburne as Morpheus is great as usual but is not enough to carry the film. Apart from Niobe's character there is no other performance worth mentioning.Of course the SFX are top notch, but for what? Whatever shred of story there is is just a vehicle to get from one action sequence to the next. Were TWO fights vs hundreds of Agent Smiths really necessary, wouldn't one be enough? And then what's up with the fight with the guy who's guarding the Oracle....totally unneccessary other than to show off the same tired bullet time effect, which was used well in the first film but ridiculously overdone in this one. By the 7th or 8th time you've seen it done it's annoying. Not to mention there's no sense of danger involved at all. You KNOW nothing's going to happen to any of the main characters which totally robs all the fight scenes of any sense of drama. We already know who will win.This movie was very disappointing. I enjoyed the first one a lot because it actually had a plot and a storyline that went somewhere, this was just pure crap. A bunch of action scenes and pseudo-philosophical garbage trying to pass itself off as a smart movie. I guess it is smart for an audience of braindead teenagers. Just stick with action, (you know, where something actually happens), for the 3rd part and maybe this series can be revived.",5,0,0,26 May 2003
