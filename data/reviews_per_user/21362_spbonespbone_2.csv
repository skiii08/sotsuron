The Avengers," 3rd Highest Grossing (All Time), Greatest Live-Action Movie!
","This movie is the 6th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It combines most of the original Avengers team - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America.I wished that Wasp and Ant Man would be included in this film, that would be great, unfortunately, they did not make a debut.The movie is about how Loki (Thor's adopted brother), a Norse deity, steals the Tesseract and makes it his own power. The Tesseract is an extremely powerful energy source, and wishes to rule over the Earth. His belief is that 'freedom' is evil - they should get free of 'freedom'. The Avengers try to stop him and fight and win a war against him and his army; he and Thor are sent back to their home because of a portal made by the Tesseract.Do watch it - it's thrilling and exciting. There are marvelous 3D graphics! According to me, it's an amazing continuation to others from the Marvel Studio and somewhat better too. After all, it has grossed much more than them and is Marvel's most successful movie yet - 3rd highest-grossing movie of all time after Titanic and Avatar!I can't wait for it's sequels that will release soon - Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. Will they be better an be the best films of all time!?",10,4,10,16 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A bit boring!
","The movie's plot might be interesting, but I found the action very boring. There was very little organization, and I think it could've been much better.I saw it in 3D recently, and the 3D effects were actually good. There was a part in which a boy named Anakin is in a racing competition, and his race seemed extremely long and boring. However, the 3D effects makes it a bit exciting, especially for young children. I think the 3D effects were an improvement.In the rest of the movie, there was a lot of action, but ultimately it was not very interesting, and I was hoping for a re-release of the older version of Star War movies, which were much better according to me.",6,1,5,10 April 2012
