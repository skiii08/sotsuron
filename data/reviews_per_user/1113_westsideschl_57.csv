Blade Runner 2049," KISS
","Not as memorable as the original, but good. Here are some reasons I wasn't super impressed. Also included is a basic guide to who is what. 
1. Seems to be a paucity of flying cars unlike the original which had them practically running into each other, now most of the movie you just see the one. Same old poor science of vehicles making swooshing sounds (whether in the near vacuum of space or though air on whatever planet). Never did figure out the propulsion system - oh well, details. 
2. The movie's secondary theme was for the new Replicant 'K' (Ryan Gosling) to dispatch the old replicants, but you didn't see a cohesive storyline on that. K's killing of one of the last of the original Replicants (Sapper) who has spent the last 30 years just being a lonely farmer of protein for humanity didn't make any sense, and left a bad taste since he was a good guy. There are creative ways to deal with this situation, but the writers took the cheap way. 
3. Another secondary theme was Mr. Wallace's (bad guy) purchase of the Tyrell Corp. (old Replicant makers) so that he can build an army to take over. Luv is his Replicant assistant that does the dirty work. 
4. The primary theme of the movie is K's search (as well as Mr. Marsahll/Luv) to find the daughter (and/or son) of a union between old Deckard and old Replicant Rachael thus giving insight into a potential new human/replicant super race. Unfortunately the tale of this mysterious offspring and Rachael's later re-animation (which was an incredible bit of CGI) received little story/movie time. Also not explained is how the biology for this union would have even the remotest possibility. 
5. Not clearly written or played out was the subplot of 6-10-21 labeled toy horse (and labeled tree) that belonged to the perhaps dead son of this union and is now in K's possession or is it in the ashes of a furnace? 
6. Also not clear were all the Biblical references as if the regular audience should ferret them out in span of a couple of hours watching. The original film had a more thematic impact that was clearly understandable with less obscurity. 
7. Storylines left hanging was the new Replicant potential uprising near the end of the film, and Deckard/Rachael's daughter now living in a bubble (right under baddie Mr. Marshall's watch). Also left hanging is K's demise (or not)?
8. True to the original there's lots of rain; neon lights; overhanging tall buildings, and no sunny skies. 
Conclusion: The original had more thoughtful impact.",7,5,10,15 February 2018

The Monuments Men," Fake Art
","Problems right off the bat: 1. Certain types of movies, especially docudramas, should not be cast with well known, famous names. Their personalities detract from what were common, everyday down-to- earth people. The actors seemed more like caricatures of themselves. 2. If there was a war going on you would never know it. Seemed more like a tour of famous art collections in Hollywood. 3. The dialogue not only seemed misplaced but had that Hollywood writer speak to it; overeducated, over articulated Beverly Hills cleanliness. 4. Speaking of cleanliness did you seen any dents, scratches on the vehicles let along dust? Even the uniforms had that freshly manicured look. Why is that important? Attention to detail is one indicator of authenticity. 5. Most importantly I couldn't get any emotional attachment to anything including that most important goal of saving works of art. They could have been saving truckloads of McDonald's burgers and I wouldn't have known any differently.",4,1,1,30 May 2014
Hereditary," Smorgasbord
","Recently horror movies have been using the shotgun (figuratively) approach to their scripts - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. In this case we get demon worshippers; seances; ghosts or ghost like; candles & moving thingies; floating & spider like wall/ceiling climbing; corpse defacing (haha!); decapitation; bird death; ancient texts; attics; cemeteries; fields; weird sounds from people; genetics; psychotic episodes. I think they left room for H2. Great acting; script was decent. Camera, props & editing all good.",6,0,1,21 September 2018
John Wick," Storytelling is Good Copying
","All the below are non-creative copying of past movies (done many times before): 1. Opening scene - alarm clock going off. 2. Coffee brewing. 3. Casket being lowered; raining for effect; long shot of cemetery showing stranger watching. 4. Afterwards, solemn wake party. 5. Mystery package at door. From? Of course. 6. Bad guys are (Guess what nationality?) $1000 if you have no idea. And, of course, are as stereotypic as cut-out doll figures. 7. Older hot cars and lots of squealing tires, burning rubber (or synthetic equivalent). You would think Reeves character would be past that 17 year old's infatuation. 8. Master killer still has an arsenal hidden away, why? Anticipated this precise series of events unfolding many years earlier. Or, nostalgia. 9. Reeves is covered in tats, of course, to show us toughness. Russian iconic tats no less - oops! 10. Dozen (cheaper that way) bad guys need some skill training because they're slow, dumb and can't seem to shoot at a target a few feet away and always walk around corners without looking first. 11. Been done before 'cleaning crew' just a call away to dispose of waste animal tissue (human of course). They always look the same in these movies. 12. Usual cheap scene filler, and getting really tedious, helicopter shot of city and car traveling on road below (even did a several times). 13. Background music the usual rock/blues/alter/jazz sound. 14. Barely clothed chicks tossed in for the male viewer and one to be bad. 15. Same old club scenes with strobes. 16. Usual wharf/dock driving and shooting scenes. 17. Now for the fun part and a new record surpassing the past record of 65 kills by one individual in a movie (can't remember the movie from a couple of years ago but it had that Detroit blighted semi-deserted projects, public housing/towers backdrop with this guy going through the floors shooting all the druggies). The new record for a movie is (drum roll) 73 by Reeves and 8 by others = 81 (maybe more, hard to keep track at times).",2,11,20,12 February 2015
Rocketman," Sure Swings a Mean Bat
","Written, directed, choreographed, acted w/moving musicality & story telling. As for actor Egerton playing Elton I will say he sure strokes/swings a mean bat, as well as pulling off everything else. Criticism: Some stereotyping at times, and perhaps a bit glossed over, but certainly I've seen far worse in other bios.",8,1,3,17 September 2019
Gravity," 1/2 star
","1/2 (half) star for the wire/green screen/CGI. 0 (zero) stars for the rest. Who cares about accuracy and education with our fantasy? 1. Anyone who has watched NASA TV broadcasts of shuttle/Hubble/ISS walks will laugh at all the stupid dialogue that this movie pushes forward as a reality. 2. The Russians, as joint participants, would never use a missile to experimentally blow up a satellite close to any working space endeavor. And, there are much easier ways to allow a satellite to de-orbit and burn. And, just to test missile capability for satellites again there are much easier alternatives. 3. Although space junk and natural space entities can reach relative speeds in the tens of thousands of mph it is far fetched to have so much debris accumulatively arrive so quickly. 4. Velocity and acceleration is far more fine tunable with pressurized gas from a MMU so all that flying about was a 'bit' excessive. Even the movement by hand seemed excessive. 5. The talking out loud dialogue presented by Bullock would be comical to any who has faced life ending desperate situations. 6. Clooney's scenes were just as far fetched. 7. The tumbling escape module, all aflame, with heat tiles rarely in a position to help should have left her as a cinder. 8. The landing in a lake; removal of suit (do you know how long most people can hold their breath in a relaxed safe environment); walking out of the water like after a dip in the Mediterranean - pleassssee!",1,3,8,9 March 2014
The Death of Stalin," Stalin Today
","Well some of it is not historically accurate, but if you want a quick, dirty & rough idea of the period when he ruled then it was tolerable. Somewhat dark, sort of comedic lines and scenes to make the subject palatable for most viewers. Stalin was basically equivalent to an amorphous melding of the best (notorious) attributes of Putin, Kim Jong-un, Erdogan, & Trump.",Null,0,2,4 July 2018
Captain Marvel," Yes, It's just Make Believe
","OK, I get it, it's just make believe sci-fi, but good sci-fi has some plausibility for the future.
Negatives:
1. CGI average at best & a lot of it is just re-using already coded & stored effects from other movies. Why do the cities & spacecraft w/the same physically dumb swooshing sound found in similar movies look as if made-up by a college design major hyper on drugs. Reality plausibility - zero!
2. Dialogue is at a level you would use grocery shopping. Over-simplistic, not intelligent. Aliens have better English articulation & grammar than actual English have. As supposed baddies their dead Satan look is the look du jour in sci-fi. And, why do aliens always have the same body plan as us, i.e. two of every thing except nose, mouth (yes, I know, it's cheaper to clothe a stunt human).
3. Jump points that look borrowed from bee architects? I knew they were smart little critters, but that made no sense. Writers avoided the problem of unimaginable distances & time to travel as usual.
4. The unlimited smorgasbord of energy emanating from her body was laughably dumb, but entertaining. Usual white eyes which mean?
Positives:
1. Liked the now defunct Blockbuster scene; the cat (homage to Guardians?).
2. The plot point of Skrulls wanting a home to call their own - subtle reference to Palestine-Israel forever issue",4,2,3,30 June 2019
Knives Out," Too Contrived
","Without giving anything away I'll be a bit vague.
We all know this plot script having seen/read many iterations before.
Positive: Credit for the little twists to the who dunnits.
Negatives: It just plodded along w/exaggerated, artificial & not believable character roles. Also, not believable that such a mentally healthy Go player would be in this scenario. And, not believable were the elaborate cover ups & the subsequent sleuthing. Finally, the irony of the ending was also far fetched & contrived. Acting - meh!",5,3,6,12 March 2020
Rise of the Guardians," Quite Good Animation
","Above average animation quality in all respects - modeling, lighting, composition, etc. As others have mentioned may not be for the youngest of viewers as character Pitch Black & his dead horses are rather nasty/scary at times. Storyline script is intelligent for all other ages on up. This came with a second DVD in a set collectively called Ultimate Holiday Collection consisting of short tales of other DreamWorks characters such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda Po, Train Your Dragon, etc., but not as high a storyline & animation quality.",8,0,0,17 February 2020
Aquaman," More Dumbing Down Science
","Dumbing down fantasy:
Aquaman created 70+ years ago when science (crude compared to today) for young adults was poor at best. A time when ancient myths such as Atlantis held sway in people's imaginations. Atlantis a city w/humans? Living at the bottom of the ocean. Never mind pressures & its effects at different depths, and even how cities could be constructed;. How human Atlanteans could breathe w/out gills or any other mode of O2 absorption; how they could talk at any depth & in perfect English (try talking under water and see how H2O density makes speech unintelligible). How there could be a paradise of trees & waterfalls at the Earth's core (forget pressure; thousands of degrees heat; molten iron).Usual script hooks of bullying of young Aquaman; lots of lasers & martial arts kicks (also found in recently released Bumblebee); lots of strength displays like lifting a submarine out of the water, but oddly it takes more effort to just toss a human about. Lots of stereotyping of characters - formula good 'n' bad. Our underwater humans say they have the greatest military on the planet yet they're riding around on giant seahorses & sharks. The one positive to the movie was the justification for war against the surface because our plastic pollution (millions of tons per year) is destroying their habitat. Appropriately we get a real scene with hills of plastic garbage being thrown back at us.",4,2,4,7 April 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Better Than Expected
","In the mode of Guardians it has that laid back self-deprecating, poke fun of yourself, humor which allows one to overlook the far less than sound science behind it all. Great graphics or CGI or visuals or animation or etc. or whatever they call all those subcategories of made-by-a-computer. Best of all was that Led Zep, 'Immigrant Song', soundtrack to highlight devastating firefights (or is it laser or electrical or whatever) effects.",8,2,5,21 March 2018
Ready Player One," Easter Eggs
","It's good to see a sci-fi movie where the writers actually did some research - did their homework.
First, a comment on the main complaint from low rating reviews about it not following the book. Movies and books are different mediums w/different ways of presenting/emphasizing their POVs. And, every retelling of a story will change it, often for the better. The CGI, action, dialogue were so overwhelming it might require seeing twice to appreciate it all. The mostly '80s music wasl spot on - must have been a good decade for music. The subtle cameos by Chucky, Railgun, MechaGodzilla, Wired Magazine, a Gandalf typecast were hilarious. My only negative is the over emphasis on teen heroes, teen stereotyping and subsequent romance all to attract that large paying demographic.",7,1,2,11 August 2018
"I, Tonya"," One Sided
","I saw the events live when they originally took place, and followed the news for a few years after. Right off, I was disappointed in this movie's one-sided interpretation. It was so overloaded w/negative behaviors you would think every one portrayed spent their entire lives doing nothing but being evil/hateful etc. It was loaded with continuous swearing, yelling, smoking, drugs, abuse, ego. It's what happens when fame & money govern our values. Although unusual in how this took place it is not without precedent in sports w/cheating & dishonesty the past hundred years (including quite recently) in baseball, basketball, football, tennis, cricket, track, cycling, gymnastics (e.g. using drugs that help a person focus), soccer (even to the point of fans dying).",3,1,4,29 March 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Well Done, but ...
","Liked: The historic political ties of, 'I can make America great again.', and 'America first.' David Duke w/Trump. Both statements show that timeless insight into the biological impetus for 'me first', and working concentrically outward to family, tribe, community, etc. But, we also see what human compassion and reason can contribute to reshaping that narrative.Would have liked to see: Mentioned a lot in the movie so could have used some commentary to understand why (reasons for) KKK, supremacists, etc. hatred toward communism, and Judaism; is it religious, or historic economics such as in pre WWII Germany?",7,1,2,16 November 2018
Interstellar," A Dumbing Down Experience
","A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love.",3,6,12,20 April 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," A Popping' Good Spoof
","Negative reviews understandable if pop and/or music film performers evoke (hooked) some adoration, even idolatry, from 'fandom'. This film is a straightforward parody (spoofing) of the commercialization & selling of a star to a wide-eyed gullible audience. From writing (and selling) dumb lyrics; a shallow persona; an attending entourage (Conner4Real - yes, that's our star's stage name) possesses amongst his 30+ personal attendants someone to watch over his pet turtle. Most ludicrous was his hook up with an appliance manufacturer, Aquaspin, to have his songs play when you open the dishwasher (etc.) door. Again spoofing how we buy into anything the 'worshipped' attach their names to. The TMZ (called CMZ here), celebrity gossip scene spoofs were spot on. Finally, were all the film's 10 second celebrity guest spots giving commentary on our show star's sorry state of affairs as his career rises and falls and maybe rises again - watch and see. These guests spots included as follows: Underwood, NAS, 50 Cent, Ringo, Levine, Carey, RZA, Seal, Fallon, and more.",9,1,2,19 September 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," A Star is Born
","Although 'A Star is Born' was good, it still was standard storyline of success in music w/effort, talent, luck w/some interpersonal hiccups along the way. Acted by people already talented in that field. However in Bohemian is a story that covers a range of issues by an actor unfamiliar w/the central character, nor appropriately talented. Nevertheless an amazing performance. Also by his band actors.Background: Freddy Mercury born as Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar to Parsi Indian parents. He spent most of his early life in India.Press reactions to the title song. '...they use instrumental effects which hint at opera in the same way that bad movie music palely evokes the symphony...', 'contrived' - Melody Maker, '...continues to come off as wannabe Led Zep...', 'meandering and meaningless...', '...unfortunately not the stuff of sonnets...' - Time Mag, '...a song that should be sunk to the bottom of the sea and never heard from again...', '...a brazen hodge lodge...' _ Rolling Stone, '...dull pastiche...', '...pompous and overlong...', 'there's scarcely a shred of tune and certainly no one line to latch on to' - Record Mirror, '...pretty empty, all flash and calculation w/out soul...', '...a song that has no chorus and attempts at least six disparate genres in six minutes...'",9,1,1,3 March 2019
Justice League," Dumb
","1. Special effects - nothing new (not creative, intelligent) basically juvenile and cheap and redundant. 
2. Same old dysfunctional super heroes with issues as if to make them more relatable to us humans, but only done to sell the product to viewers. 
3. A lot of the typical bad science (meaning would have a hard time passing middle school science. One scene were a critical timing of capturing a mother cube as it is falling and just as it touches the water needs to be timed to the millisecond to be workable so how do our super heroes time the event - just a verbal five, four, three.... 
4. Dialogue compatible with storyline of dumbed down e.g. Wonder Woman's insightful and critical line 'He's back!'. Geee, she's so articulate. That also would fail a middle school language arts writing assignment.",3,1,2,7 April 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Whoa!
","I started the first few minutes a little apprehensive about the quality of where this animation was going, but soon started to become impressed, and as it went on even more so impressed. Not the very best animation realism I've seen, but uniquely creative especially the multi-dimensional quantum effects - mind blowingly intelligent & unique. The dialogue was over-the-top intelligent, witty, comically self-effacing at times. I had to use subtitling just to keep up w/the depth of satire, banter, burlesque. The voicing actors were well selected, adding audio nuance to the characters. Then there is the multi-dimensional dessert in the form of Spider-Ham, Peni Parker, Spider-Man Noir, Aunty, Gwen.
Conclusion: An overwhelming intelligent & visual treat.",10,0,1,6 April 2019
Yesterday," Comme ci, Comme Ã§a
","Positive: Creative storytelling however how & why so selective a removal from history of certain pop items (Beatles; Coke; Potter) could have used a bit more reasonable explaining, but then too it was fantasy. Sampling the vast compilation was a pleasure. One twisty toward the end was a surprise, but welcomed.
Negatives: The romantic hook was overused, and placed just to meet demographic monied demands. The other twisty (confession) toward the end not sure it was needed/helpful, or would have been understood, and even meaningless. A better alternative would be to have given their names as co-producers of the songs.
Neutral: Can't decide if the inadequate singing helped other than it allowed viewers to focus more on the lyrics & less on the performer.",7,0,1,4 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Poor Science but Who Cares
","The better the ratings on a sci-fi movie the worse the science, but who cares if we're being fed thus absorb 'fake' information. More combustion powered & structurally dumb space vehicles making sounds in the vacuum of space & swooshing sounds in air. Well, looks cool as do all the super powers that seem to get crazier w/each new series release. Why are little things like glassy rocks so empowered in sci-fi/fantasy movies? Usual dumbed down dialogue except the three worded line by one famous (and the movie is loaded w/famous) actor (bet you can't guess who).
Started slow, but got hot 'n' heavy towards the end.",8,0,4,1 September 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Disappointment
","Two stars for the CGI of Orcs and Smaug. Otherwise, one star for the overly simplistic dialogue better suited to a juvenile audience. Included in that one star is the lack of any levels of intelligent storytelling - just a one level script and that one level was pointless overdone and empty gratuitous violence (spearing Orcs through their eyes; cutting their heads off; etc.). The acting, sets, makeup and costuming also seemed cheaply hurried. The green screen scene backdrops looked amateurish when contrasted with the real NZ scenery.They seem to be going overboard in selling the NZ scenery - does the studio have holdings in tourist oriented money making?",2,6,8,26 April 2014
Toy Story 4," For All Ages
","For all ages, including a nuanced shoutout to horror film dolls. You know who you are! But, presented in an acceptable for all ages way. Usual Toy Story quality - voicing, storytelling, morality teaching, animation quality all quite good. Had to have a cat, and it held up it's nasty role quite well.",8,0,3,18 October 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Jaw Dropping Opulence
","Whether the hotel rooms' sets came from custom set design; cgi; or actual filming locations it was all jaw dropping engaging in its opulence. The film showcases that period between wars in eastern Europe when fortunes rapidly rose only to just as rapidly dissipate. We follow those fortunes and lifestyles through the guests, workers and others whose lives intersect with the hotel's rise & fall. Not only the sets, but the props and costuming were all period appropriate first rate. The painted mat backdrop for the hotel gave an other-worldly fantastical feel to the film's locality. On the downside the script itself was uneven - not polished thus not comfortably easy for a viewer to get hooked into the plot's digressions. The acting, on the other hand, was superb. It completely sold that not-quite- real fantasy feel to the story.",8,2,4,29 June 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," Money, Money, Money
","First about the herd of low star ratings decrying the cost. Learn patience and wait until a library has a copy. 
Second, the movie & music industries long ago established non-competitive pricing amongst themselves for their products that garnered excessive profits (like the pharmaceutical peoples today). Apple & digital helped to reduce that. The message at the beginning 'Piracy is not a victimless crime ... harms the economy.' is in place w/the help of lobbyists and politicians (wanting donations), and is mostly meant to maximize those profits. 
Third, as to the movie it should be commended for it's vast CGI effects although it's getting computer cheap to produce those effects these days. On the down side, out CGI-ing everyone else has the effect of making us boringly saturated with over-effects, and loss of meaningful story, intelligent dialogue & good acting. 
Fourth, don't expect intelligent scripting e.g. sound effects still in space; physically impossible space structures; bad science i.e. the Big Bang created six colored glass crystals??; the usual colored lasers; fire throwing, & force fields from your hands; swords, guns & naugahyde clothing (from cheap plastic if you don't know); aliens w/vocal structures that speak perfect English (at least they didn't script some subtitled alien speak). 
Fifth, excessive dramatic music to sub for realistic and/or repetitive action. Dialogue amongst all seemed at a dumbed down level like neighbors arguing over which football team is better. Science dialogue such as describing a 'quadrant' is pre-digital 19th century accuracy - dumb! 
Sixth, the ending and the recently overused CGI of bodies turning to ashy bits of floating organic material was obscure, and meant to make more money on a sequel.",4,1,5,23 August 2018
Get Out," Fun Movie
","Several things to like about this one. 1. How it approached a sensitive subject was both directly honest and at times unexpectedly (by viewer, but of course by design) funny. 2. Actors well chosen and their performances almost too real to the point of weird- scary. You just don't know what secretly lurks behind those smiles. 3. You know something is not quite right and the writer/director did a nice job of building into 'how-not-right-it-was'. 4. Rod our TSA agent, and friend to Chris, our lead protagonist, was a highlight bonus, offering a humorous perspective (a role where usually the confidant ends up being either clueless, incompetent, or dead) . Check out his end-of-film worldly advices (sp) to Chris in special features. 5. I preferred the ending that our director chose vs. the alternate ending as it was consistent with Chris's intelligence and personality.",8,10,19,8 July 2017
Aladdin," No Depth of Feeling
","Seemed more like trying to connect as a contemporaneous story telling commercialization with heavy dependance on the CGI to carry the story & to be relevant to today's audience.

","If you did not know it was CGI, you would not know that it was CGI. Visually it was amazing. We are now in an era of creating reality that can't be discerned from reality. My only small criticism is the use of name actors/celebrities for voicing - not as interesting as trained voice actors. Kudos to layout, animation, FX, environment, lighting, compositing artists/staff/production peoples. Liked the quote, 'A true king's power is his compassion.' Does that also apply to presidents? Even though animals kill animals for a variety of reasons it's an interesting dilemma as to exposing children to that visual reality.",8,1,3,4 November 2019
A Quiet Place," Poor Little Spidery Thingys
","Well the storyline idea held promise with the creatures (although a bit stereotyped w/lots of teeth and spikey spidery legs/arms) graphically well done. One of these days outside of teethy and/or spidery aliens (seems the rage the past decade or so) and wormy creatures living inside us we need a a monster we don't expect like something panda bear cuddly to terrorize us. 
I may have missed something, but how did these things wipe out humanity, and (not sure) all the other living creatures (except birds it seems)? Where did they come from that had the same oxygenated percentage atmosphere as Earth, and furthermore sound is not exactly an evolutionary cognitive empowering sense. What was most disappointing was how quickly obvious it was to me that they should be hypersensitive to certain frequencies. Could have used less background music; fewer sudden jump scares; fewer dumb mistakes (but then we wouldn't have a movie - maybe). C'est la guerre.",3,1,3,23 July 2018
1917," Shaving?
","Positive: Good visuals e.g. the trenches whether accurate or not.
But: Right off the bat I was alerted to potential problems w/some incongruence beginning w/the contemporary hand clasp & quickly followed by everyone without a speck of mud on their clothing. Next the soldiers (and I mean thousands) were all clean shaven. Not a stubble to be seen let alone razors; soap, & water in a barren landscape with not a drop of clean H2O for miles. And, the business of latrines or lack of. Couldn't figure out building miles of trenches nicely braced w/cut lumber; sandbags; wiring & again with no trees or other building resources. Oh, middle of a battlefield to challenge it all.
German soldier predictably was portrayed as nasty; Allied soldiers as nice & helping.
Nice predictable ending.",4,3,6,2 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Middle School
","This is an example of writing for the middle school masses. Not yet bright enough (well not all) to be critical, and with little history of seeing cheap inaccurate redundancies. 
1. Centuries from now fighter craft w/combustion flaming propulsion? Please!
2. Everyone is still wearing what looks like WWII surplus clothing, and the purple dyed hair in Vice Admiral (what does the Navy have to do with all this) - how late 1900s. 
3. Sound effects dominate the movie (a crutch I suppose for lazy writing & research) in the vacuum of space (or just anywhere to add effect). Also, overbearing music though out to add effect a form of cheap action subbing. 
4. Lots of dumbed down simplistic dialogue thus showing no desire to educate an audience or require thought.
5. Same old storyline - boringly predictable.
6. Too heavy a reliance on the same old visuals of things burning in space which incidentally would also fail middle school science. Also, the accelerations/decelerations - not possible especially for living occupants. More dumbing down. 
7. All these years no one has ever bothered to explain the physics behind a light saber laser stopping a meter away from it's source.
Conclusion: Scify (Sci-fi) can be done intelligently w/a bit of creative research & writing, and less concern for the bottom line.",2,7,11,7 April 2018
Hotel Mumbai," Violent, Yes
","Some would say there was too much violence, but my counter is that 165 died & 300 wounded in this attack on 12 places over three days and it would be a disservice to those affected to minimize it. Even so the director chose not to glamorize the shootings & killings, but showed a clean version relative to what was possible. The reality - some were tortured & disfigured.
After this 11/26/2008 attack the Taj Mahal Hotel was repaired & reopened to show that they would not be defeated by terrorism. Some terrorist leaders & helpers were found up to years later, but supposedly the prime leader is free. Again, history has shown us uncountable times that religion is the source of wars, conflicts, killings, subjugation, or as terrorists say, 'God is great.'Researched & filmed in Mumbai, India, and in Australia.",10,7,24,30 June 2019
Friends with Benefits," How to sell the same product again to the same person.
","Yes, the movie made money. Yes, it was filmed in L.A. and N.Y. - where else, duh! Yes, the old salesmen trick of repackaging the same product to sell to the same schmuck by changing the packaging a little works as usual and always has and always will. So what do the cloistered writers, producers and directors in N.Y. & L.A. do with their lives well, sit in little pretend manly cubicles trying to tweak another dollar out of the rom-com boxed-in consumer. What is the formula that's tweaked? Middle class white professionals that cuss a lot to bluff toughness; sex dominates their discussions; monetary self interest dominates their social consciousness; parties, bars and objects- du-jour their support system. What's tweaked? Change an actor or two but not too many; change an office/occupation but not too many; change the social scenes but not too many. Everything else stays the same predictable self including the ending. Ah hah moment, the monetary comfort of predictability in exchange for the psychological comfort of predictable fantasy.",2,3,6,5 January 2012
Midsommar," Stereotyping
","Acting was not particularly captivating; decision making by our commune visiting group was on the same level of believability as believing in little green aliens from Mars. Script seemed to be a redux of other past mysterious commune killer films. More laughable than scary, intelligent or creatively intriguing. If this production reflects Swedish intelligence - they need some help.",2,8,13,23 October 2019
Woman in Gold," Helen for Academy Award
","Synopsis: Docudrama based on one example (the story surrounding Maria Altmann) of WWII era Nazi German confiscation (or theft) of property owned by Jews. In this case her effort as an American with Austrian roots along with her lawyer who also happened to have Austrian roots in challenging the Austrian government over the rights to some Klimt art, most notably 'Woman in Gold', which was once owned by members of her family one of whom was the subject for that painting. Highlights: Well written film - intelligent, funny, props, settings camera work and dramatic flow to the story; all engaging. Albeit, a little too good guy/bad guy glossified. The highest highlight belongs to Helen Mirren who was a spot-on naturally funny, sagacious, sarcastic (in a good way), sympathetic character. An aside political comment: Liberal Jews would probably agree with me that Israel's restrictive reservation treatment of the Palestinians in some ways mirrors Jewish history. What took place in the film is, in a different way, taking place today.",8,0,0,17 July 2015
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Power Never Changes
","I too was torn between giving an eight and one star rating so somewhere in-between. Yes, the visuals are excessive, i.e. forcing people to eat fecal stuff (actually chocolate - phew); physical torture; full nudity (male & female); some sex including a bit out of the mainstream, but camera angles were such that nothing was shown (left to imagination, etc.). There actually was a thematic point to the film's visceral story, illustrated by the following comments: We see the relationship of power using sex to treat others like a commodity. The anarchy of power can be seen in fascism. Power can do what it wants, and what it wants is completely arbitrary. It is dictated by its eccentric needs which elude common logic. Power people are enamored with their own identity. 
For a film over 40 years old it strangely has some current applicability, i.e. I kept being reminded of a present day U.S. political leader.",5,0,2,6 June 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Fish Eyes Anyone?
","This film and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' series are bringing fun back to sic-fi fantasy, and as good as G of the G is I thought that Journey hit all the marks. Creative storytelling, bizarrely interesting acting, sarcastic/whimsical/ridiculous/playful yet intelligent humor, fantastic CGI (love those fish eyes rolling around & the toy like demon was outrageously funny scary), CGI backgrounds, props, sets, costuming - all first rate. The story even had it's heartbreaking human side. Kudos to the writer/director for attention to detail at any cost, and for unique storytelling.",9,3,7,16 September 2017

It Chapter Two," It Comme ci, Comme ça
","Positives: Good CGI special effects. Nice, almost humorous, twisty ending.
Negatives: Too many flashbacks; except for the end. Not enough 'clowning about', needed more. Script's solution to the Pennywise problem was a little too not-likely-simplistic-not-believable. Acting - adequate, but nothing to remember.",5,0,1,2 January 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hollywood History w/ a Laugh
","You, the reader/viewer will be either: (a.) familiar with films within the decade following WWII or (b.) have no clue. If (a.) then you will quickly recognize the spoofy, yet intelligent, presentation of the genres popular then as well as the politics of that formative era. Genres such as Westerns; dance dominant musicals; epics; upper class glamor films; and, oddly, swimming as a plot central vehicle. If (b.) you are going to ask yourself, 'What were they thinking!' Well researched, with great attention to detail, props, sets and over-the-top exaggerated acting/dialogue to yellow highlight the salient features of those films. Even a touch of historical drama with the 'Commie' element infiltrating Hollywood. Special Features provided another film's worth of insight.",8,0,1,12 July 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Details, Details, Details
","Details make a film good, so here's a small list: 1. The geological landscape is more central China limestone than south Pacific island volcanism. 2. The animal species do not fit the landscape, but rather everywhere else on Earth - all at one time. 3. The biggest animals on Earth are buoyed by water for a reason - there's a gravity defined limit to weight and supportive structures. Kong at 1/10 his size would have exceeded it. 4. Helis approaching within arm's reach of Kong - dumb. No reason for the gunfire initially, but makes good action film. Why do fairly large caliber weapons used throughout have surprisingly little effect? 5. Where did the natives get the machinery to make their finely woven, consistently dyed cloth? And their steel bladed weapons? 6. Military portrayal was way over the top not real, especially the belligerent Colonel. Came across as more humorous than villainous. Very fakey insubordination scenes. 7. Why do male leads in action movies almost always have the tight, ultra-short sleeve t-shirt muscle look - feelings of compensatory inadequacy, narcissism? Obvious they are about as athletic as a wet noodle, anyway. 8. OK, Kong's parents dead, but where are the thousands more needed to genetically maintain this kind? Would like to know who Kong's dentist is with such perfect white teeth. 9. Just as Kong would be gravity squished on Earth so in a similar way those critters (usual many sharpy teeth, and doesn't make sense two limbs) coming from deep inside Earth would have been baked by the rapidly increasing temps as you go down, even just part of a mile.",2,1,3,24 July 2017
Parasite," Not Memorable
","Two families of people; one poor, poorly educated; unemployed, and willing to lie to get money. The other wealthy, loving family, existing in their own world. What happens when they cross paths? Well, for one, a weird ending that didn't fit w/the rest of the story.
Overall impression: I'm not going to remember this movie unlike, first & foremost, 'The Lighthouse', then 'Once Upon a Time ...', 'Joker', and 'Judy'. Relative to the those creations I'm not sure why this movie garnered so many awards.",4,10,31,12 February 2020
The Water Diviner," Learn Nothing of that Conflict
","The film, in part, tells that part of WWI, around 1915, involving U.K. forces storming the beach at Anzac Cove; part of the Gallipoli Campaign to fight Ottoman forces. U.K. forces were militarily superior with about equal numbers with the Turks, but they might have been a bit apathetic as they end up losing. Story centers on the Australian contribution as represented by the three sons of an Aussie farmer. Today, still a significant Australian remembrance.Negatives: 1. Although a small attempt was made to show that there is always another side in a war, what we get of the Turks is just movie stuff. The real history of this conflict with hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded is poorly treated. 2. A good part of the film is filled with the usual romantic encounter and discord and distrust. The female part in the movie is unrealistically attractive for the role, thus not too believable. Tossed in is the customary plot hook of her engaging young son to reel in the Aussie who, of course, had lost his wife. 3. More obstacles are placed in our hero's search for his lost sons with unusually cold bureaucratic barriers being placed in his way - to be overcome, of course. Again, not believable. 4. Dialogue was inane. Directing was disjointed in that the film used excessive numbers of flashbacks to explain what could have been given at the beginning and resulted in better continuity to the story. Acting was too predictable and a bit stereotyped. Ending also became too predictable.",3,6,16,10 August 2015
Wonder Woman," Unwonderful
","Positives: Can't think of any. Negatives: 1. Really bad science such as jumping off a moving horse and landing without a forward momentum. Failed middle school science. Effortless jumps of hundreds or more feet. Would work if we knew what force (other than leg muscles) she utilized, but none given as none exists even in 'Wonderland'. 2. Grade school dialogue with lots of petty arguments amongst the Amazonians which is unworthy of their stature (pun). 3. Lots of middles ages weapons and fighting skills. Why just that period of tech & culture? For a people who live forever you would think they would educate themselves to something a little better, or at least venture into 'man's' world and borrow a few ideas. Dumb! 4. Since they don't venture into 'man's' world how and why does each person learn a 100 different languages, to what end. More dumb. 5. Why all the makeup? 6. Why the synthetic Hollywood costume shop plastic looking clothing that never seems to get dirty or torn? 7. Action scenes were stereotypic, non-creative, borrowing of the same moves found in all action flicks. One typical puzzler is while she's being shot at (several hundred rounds/min) by several machine guns she just stands there holding a shield for upper body protection leaving legs exposed yet not a single round strays in that direction. Add in wrist bullet deflectors and the really cheap CGI of electrical zapping and her wonder skills become laughing skills. 8. Acting was moronic & robotic to satisfy middle school audiences willing to accept anything with attractive women. Add in the romantic scenes for money making audience appeal which did nothing to enhance her specialness. 9. Overbearing musical/sound effects give-away and often used to bolster shallow plots in movies. 10. Made a mockery of Greek classical characters. Summary: Very cartoonish level writing, acting, effects.",2,4,12,1 October 2017
Black Panther," Boring
","Let's start w/the positives. In the car chase scene (of course there had to be one) were a couple of sequences that were kind of cool. Also good to see a bit of African culture w/neck rings, lip plates & scarification. 
On the down side I was hoping to see great scenes from Africa, but instead got Georgia, USA; Korea; Argentina. 
Dialogue was typical teen level oversimplification so as not to scare the audience away or invoke brain freeze. 
Acting, unfortunately, was too rote memorization school technique. 
Action, fight sequences - same old, same old unimaginative kicks/swings w/wire tosses through the air. Car chases. Yes, boring. 
For tech we have a futuristic aircraft that made the so overused & unreal swooshing sound accompanied by the usual looks cool design, but aerodynamically would fail a middle school science class. Don't get me started on super metal, as every element we know of in the Universe has already been seen and would have already been on dear old Earth. Invisible domed city? Hasn't that already been used in several movies. Then there's the typical basement/behind a nondescript door research lab for super weapons. 
Costumes! The trend in Hollywood has always been for some fashion person holed up for life in their cubby hole making showy non-functional synthetic costumes for sy-fy/fantasy movie look always the same. 
Plot - evil family members (or corporate or government) to take over the world. Magic curing potions; hallucinatory dream sequences. Ugghhhh!",3,2,3,22 May 2018

","When the opening scenes show a gum chomping, high risk cowboy pilot putting his & other's lives at risk by showboating a dangerous stunt onto a carrier I knew what type of factuality was in store for the rest of the movie. Lots of, we never do anything wrong, nationalistic fervor which added to questioning where the movie was going. Movie is filled with scenes of animated fighters being shot at, and shooting back. The usual family, romance scenes to capture more paying viewers. Japanese, of course, mostly portrayed as ruthless such as tying an anchor to a captured pilot who upon refusing to divulge info on his unit is tossed into the sea (we see him sink slowly down of course). Odd that the end credits said dedicated to the American & Japanese sailers at Midway.",4,9,15,4 March 2020
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Mass Marketing Storytelling 9th Grade Literacy
","Your very first experience with this film is with the dialogue which should leave you wondering what level audience this film is trying to reach. I would guess any barely functioning ninth grader was their max literacy marketing level. Acting was robotic with actors chosen for eye candy appeal. Plot wise The Hunger Games 'starving' comes from a lack of creative storytelling; just far-fetched improbabilities filling 3/4ths of film then to close with the same old ending we've seen before, i.e. brief, boring scenes of someone quickly (for budgetary reasons) dying. Even then you really don't see much of that person's finale - they just cheaply disappear. Even the lack of an ending/closure is transparent storytelling for profit. Watch 'The Starving Games' spoof/parody of this movie for it's spot-on exposure of the juvenile mass marketing appeal of this movie.",2,20,36,21 March 2014
Life," Cute Little Alien
","Well, I'm going to take the middle road on this one. Positives: 1. The hardware and related physics for our space station were, for a syfy movie, quite accurate and gave as good a feel for what goes on as I've seen, including actual ISS footage.2. Our little Martian monster performed it's role quite nastily, so kudos to it. So, all you 'Alien' precursors, you've just been one upped. However, one small problem with our little alien - see negative. Negatives: 1. The biology for our Martian alien (who incidentally was better suited for a more dense fluid than gas e.g. water) failed on all counts for biological believable - almost laughable (actually it was laughable, but scary). 2. Yes the twist was a bit predictable, but they hid it well, and yes, once the ending was revealed it too had a bit of predictability. But, who cares, it's time for a change on Earth anyway.",6,3,7,4 July 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kick Ass 3
","For the first third of the film I was thinking that this was going to be a poorly constructed & written Bond ripoff with lots of formula action & stereotyping of characters. Supporting that thought was the eye candy and famous name selection of actors, who seemed to fulfill the above formula/stereotyping school-of-acting technique admirably. But then the comic book character spoofing began to emerge and first came with force with a church scene, so outrageous, that I had to cringingly watch again, just to confirm what I was seeing. Eggsy was responsible for about 60 departed poor souls (well they were haters supreme) within the house-of-the-lord no less, and another 40 or so dispatched by fellow church going haters. Add another 100 or so elsewhere and Eggsy surpasses 'John Wick' for one person personally sending baddies off to another (better?) life. There was another film, a few years back, of someone cleaning up a semi-abandoned 'Projects' development of druggies, but I can't remember the title. That one had similar outrageous numbers. Finally, the coup de grâce, was the July 4 fireworks, with appropriate musical overtures, of the security exploding heads. Disgustingly outrageous. Rivals 'Kick Ass' for over-the-top imaginative, albeit fantastical, action scenes. There was one positive message - humans, watch out, Gaia is going to extinguish you if you don't clean up your act.",8,2,7,20 June 2015
Green Book," Didn't Know What to Expect
","Good flow to the story; just the right amount of intrigue building over time. Ali & Mortensen were superb - like a good chocolate, both were salty & sweet.

Ali actually & effectively learned to perform a few piano riffs, but couldn't tell what was his playing & Kris Bowers - fooled me.",9,0,4,31 March 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Dead & Still Counting
","Positives: 1. Well if you need a killing spree mindless entertaining 90 minutes this one is hard to beat. 2. May have set a new record for number of kills by one person (one at at time); explosives etc. don't count. Ballpark I counted around 121. Hey, not easy given the speed and lack of clarity. Beats a previous record by a movie from half a dozen years ago (don't recall the title, but if anyone knows let me know) of some guy going through the floors/apartments of an inner city tenement apartment complex killing drug baddies. The center column of space had no structure so you looked across & down to other walkways. Negatives: 1. A bit formulaic starting with high speed street racing; followed by JW feeling for lost loved one; followed by desire to retire; followed by baddies in criminal consortium saying 'Not today!'. 2. Not too realistic (actually, not at all realistic even in fantasy) to dispatch so many and end up with a few scratches on the face and a little cut to the abdomen. 3. He's not the most ferocious physical specimen so his feats strain credulity. Neutral: 1. Left open a JW 3. 2. Final statement was something like, 'Who ever comes, I'll kill them all.' Well, of course. What else were we expecting?",4,0,1,27 June 2017
Annihilation," Dumb
","Any aliens watching this movie have to be laughing at all the dumbness. 
1. Bio teacher beginning to our story was not convincing at knowing her field, and even teaching. 
2. Aliens, again, arrive in some many thousands of degrees incinerating burning meteorite or something similar which indicates: (a.) They are not very good at landing on a planet so their tech has to be early human 20th century level. (b.) They forgot they are advertising their arrival to not so happy humans. (c.) Didn't leave a way back in case they made a miscalculation as to habitat.
3. Streaming soap bubble force shield or whatever looked cute, but source never explained, and anyway an overused alien invasion movie prop. 
4. Recombinant DNA as our major plot angle had promise and also looked cute at times (I liked the combo of organic plant w/sandy silicon quartz - I think.), and did showcase some good as well as bad combos. 
5. The selection of team members, if the best that U.S. security/research/military can come up with, then we are destined to lose every battle. They were poorly qualified & trained for the mission of saving humanity from the aliens. Said team members made enough mistakes to fail a middle school exam on iPhone game app competence. 
6. Aliens look, well alien, even the alien wormy thing inside a human makes a comeback. 
7. Too many flashbacks w/husband disrupted the flow.
8. Finally the ending scenes from the little incendiary to the sly will they be back look were not too intelligent given what's at stake. 
9. Finally, finally was that the best the government could come up with was a cheapass detention/isolation/interrogation room w/strips of plastic. And, didn't they bother to take survivor(s) blood sample? Let's have some credibility here folks!",2,1,3,15 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Munchies
","I am a past Alien fan, but this version seemed too stuck in the past as if the writer/director couldn't be creative. It was a redux - just redundant, nothing new. 1. An almost mid to late 20th century storytelling of alien surviving on a planet by eating living hosts. Yet massive amounts of weapon fire seem to not damage it in any way (except in one case which didn't make any sense). 2. The usual range of not believable characters (an interstellar voyage should have a well trained/stable elite crew). Lots of stupid decisions not appropriate for such a mission. 3. A space ship made of massive amounts of heavy steel (even 20th century style heavy ship chains to hold cargo) with lots of extraneous structural components everywhere, both interior & exterior, to add weight with no function. Increased complexity leads to more opportunities to break; weight is out of this world costly. Looks impressive though. 4. A giant, cloud covered planet, and our space traveling crew just happens to land on the one spot on the planet where alien craft is located",4,1,3,28 August 2017
Furious 7," Formula - Check!
","I call it profit pandering when all that the producers ask of the writer and director is to make sure there are as many formula scenes (movie history has proved these to be money makers) as possible to attract the widest audience. Check out the proof: 1. Prolonged close up shots of the rear ends (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) of bikini, barely clad, humans. Check! 2. Prolonged close up shots of the males who compensate for their small appendage (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) by over pumping (exaggerating) the male antlers (i.e. muscle). A skill acquired first by practice posturing in front of their full length mirrors. Males further enhance their displays by seeming to always be wearing tight tees (if at all) with small sleeves to promote those antlers. So much non- functional muscle that if they tried running they might outrun a sloth. Check! 3. Furthering this theme is the storyline of 'muscle' cars accompanied by prolonged close ups of 'pushing the pedal to the metal' and massaging the manual shift with the that standard coup de grâce - squealing tires. Oh, and the car drop from airplane - done before. Check! 4. Assault on bad guy fortress - done so many times in film it has actually become boring. Fight scenes - an Oscar for camera angles. Bruce Lee, if he could see this, would be laughing in his Lake View home. Check! 5. Dialogue? Written for that part of the audience that struggled to pass sophomore English in high school. Check! 6. Inject into the storyline the latest pop news headlines caption grabber - terrorists and hackers. Check!",2,2,22,22 October 2015
