Walk the Line," Brilliant Movie!
","Its difficult to comment on this movie because its almost impossible to decide where to start when describing how good it is! I'm not going to sit here and say its my favourite film or the best I've ever seen but there is very little in this film that i feel could have been improved. In a Biography,its is the acting and not the directing that is the most important, i feel anyway. The Directing is sufficient and consistent throughout and as has been echoed from professionals the world over, Joequin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deserve Oscars for their performances. I read one journalists report on this film and they say Joequins too short to play Johnny and Reese too pretty for her role. I don't know to be honest, and it may well be the case. But ill say that if that is all they can find wrong with this film then i think that says it all. I didn't know a whole lot about Johnny Cash when i watched this film and it didn't embellish on his character or romanticise his persona like most Hollywood tripe, i wont go into details but there are times you feel sorry for him, angry at him or sometimes don't care. As I've said, everything in this film is excellent or sufficient for what is needed. The Music, excellent. Directing, sufficient. And the Acting and Casting, Superb. And Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous throughout! I give this film 9 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone!",9,1,2,26 May 2006
The Big Lebowski," Fantastic the first time and better from then on!
","The Big Lebowski is a very clever, hilarious film that stands up to repeat viewings over and over again.The nature of the film is difficult to specify. Its a comedy that combines elements of surrealism with a decent sound track and visuals and is carried through with excellent performances by great actors playing very funny but unique roles. This is by no means a mainstream comedy. The story of this film, as you will find out, doesn't really stand out but what makes the film good is the acting, Direction and script which I'm sure every Big Lebowski Fan will tell you contains some of the best speeches and one liners ever written in my opinion.The Cohen Brothers in my opinion are fantastic directors for those who do not know, and their style can be seen throughout, using a very delicate balance of simple cinematography and music that wont excite the viewer but develops a pace which suits this film to perfection.All of the actors are superb, Steve Buscemi, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are all amazing and in my opinion Goodman should have one an award for his role in the film. The film also contains various other special characters throughout which just works brilliantly.There are very few if any elements to this film that could be improved. Any angle to any aspect you can think of has been chosen and executed perfectly to leave the viewer happy afterwards. And as i said it stands up to repeat viewings. I have no idea how many times I've watched it but its a lot perhaps 30+ and its still just as funny. I'm in awe of the perfect direction and faultless acting from start to finish.I have and Would recommend it to anyone and those i have love it too Enjoy!!!",10,0,1,16 June 2006
Dawn of the Dead," One Reamake Worth Watching
","I'm not normally a fan of remakes as most people ruin what was good about the original. However, the zombie genre has developed in the last few years, and what was good about the original may not be conceived as good in this day and age. The original obviously being a cult classic zombie flick, possibly the best ever, with a retro look about it that could never be re-created. So the Director had a decision to make, a gamble one might say. Try and Stick to what made the original great or try something new. He tried something new and did a very good job in my opinion.He obviously stuck to the basic story line but i feel there are other aspects to this film that make it good. First off, i felt an original cast was always going to be needed and the actors were excellent. I feel Ving Rhames and Mekhi Phifer, the only well known actors in the film, do really well and all of the other actors played their part superbly.Secondly, i don't know much about this director Zack Snyders work, but I'm going to look into more of his stuff as there was an aesthetic about the movie, a slickness one might say about it that seemed to make the movie flow nicely and the moods within the film be it, comical, horrific, romantic or Sad were shown well and entwined throughout. Be it the moment Ana and Michael fall for each other, Andy The Gunman Dies or when they're running from the zombies screaming and shouting into an elevator only for the screams and hectic camera work to stop and the Calm soothing Elevator Music starts, that i felt was a stroke of genius. It works in a very Dark way and this kind of humour can be seen throughout the film.This film was all about the Direction the Director was going to take it. He took a chance and in my opinion it paid off. A job very well done. Any fan of the traditional zombie flick may not like it as it does steer from the tried and tested formula seen for years, but otherwise i can see most people enjoying this film, especially if you liked 28 Days Later. 7/10",7,0,0,27 May 2006
Crash," Hmmmm
","I wouldn't go as far as to say it deserved an Oscar! Especially over Walking The Line, about Johnny Cash. But i can appreciate why it was widely regarded as a good film and i repeat GOOD, not Great.Its set in LA over 2 days and is made up of a series of small stories, entwining at some points throughout with Each story supposedly reflecting an aspect of racial tension or problem within American society etc. Some of which i feel worked well and were perfectly realistic and others i felt the Director tried to force upon the audience. I feel it doesn't tackle the broader problem of racism but merely highlights minor aspects of it therefor i feel it will receive mixed responses from all sides of society.It terms of how the film is constructed, i was very impressed with how the director controlled the information being given to the audience and all the separate stories progress consistently and i personally found myself engrossed throughout and not at stop start intervals. The Music reflects the moderate pace of the film and the Cinematic aspects are fresh but not over the top which makes it a film that isn't too intense visually but mentally.The acting award in this film has to go to Matt Dillon as i feel he portrayed his character the best, and was believable in the role as was Don Cheadle who is fast becoming one of a few actors i have complete faith in.All in all, i feel it is worth a watch. Afterall it did win an Oscar but then again so did Titanic so ill let you decide. Id recommend it but don't expect fireworks. I hope you find this helpful!",7,0,2,26 May 2006
The Usual Suspects," A Modern CLASSIC!
","The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist ending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be enormously influential. But in my opinion this movie is so much better and offers so much more to the viewer than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted, faultlessly acted and an excellently directed masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. I have watched this film time and time again over numerous years and its just as good as the first time i watched it and i notice small details every time i see it.This movie really put Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin who is one of the best in the whole film, and who has never appeared in a movie this good before, or since. Gabrial Byrne is outstanding as Dean Keaton and each actor makes each individual character their own.Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his subsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'. For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever made, seriously. A truly unforgettable experience for any movie watcher.",10,0,1,27 May 2006
Children of Men," A Cutting Edge, Action Packed, Thinking Mans Action Film!
","The film is set in 2027. For the past 18 odd years the human race has been unable to have children. Full Stop.This is all that is explained about the narrative during the film and this is all within the first 10 minutes. The film does little to explain what has happened, what is happening and what is going to happen after the film finishes. Normally, this would leave me feeling rather empty and unsatisfied, and whilst i would have liked more in terms of narrative throughout the film, what is included is prime viewing and delivers a very intense and gritty masterpiece that is as unrelenting in its imagery as it is compelling to watch.The style of the film mirrors this lack of information. We don't know what happened to make the human race infertile because its irrelevant to what is happening on screen. With this film, you only know what you see and what you see is what you get.First off, the aesthetics of the film are superb. Very gritty, very gloomy and most likely filmed on DV, with a similar look to 28 Days Later. If that gives you any frame of reference this darkish aesthetic almost mirrors the doom and gloom evident in the peoples lives intentionally feelings like Death, Poverty and oppression are mirrored using this medium. The obvious use of DV in the films plentiful action scenes gives the film a dimension of intensity as seen in the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan and the chase scenes in 28 Days Later.The director manages to carry the film with a steady pace. It progresses well and not once was i left wandering where the film was going, which is strange seeing as we do not really know the ultimate objectives of the main characters. By that i mean we know where they are going but we do not know why or what is going to happen afterwards.There are many many political references throughout the film. I do not care about politics enough to get into depth but the underlying morals and political references are clearly used to stimulate Leftist propaganda. There are obvious references to the Holocaust, Talitarian governments, Terrorists aka 'Freedom Fighters', White oppressors, Lesbians, Black Saviours and many more. This doesn't ruin the film in any way and is actually used to good effect in order to create the feeling of oppression that is essential in carrying the film and its underlying moral narratives. But if proper propaganda annoys you, this film may be a little hard to take. But its a film, a cutting edge, action packed thinking mans film. A compelling watch from start to finish and if you like film to be slightly different and modern whilst being highly entertaining then i would seriously recommend Children of Men to anyone. ANYONE! 8/10 - It would be nine but i do feel that a little bit of an introduction and conclusion would have gone a long way to explaining the narrative and and ultimately giving the film a much more satisfactory conclusion.",8,2,5,17 January 2007
