United 93," Best film of 2006 - without question
","Totally gripping...the numbers of people playing themselves is astounding...if this film is not recognized with at least a Best Picture nomination, the Academy Awards are not doing their job.An incredible re-enactment and statement about the most infamous day in US history. Paul Greengrass deserves a Best Director nomination and a Best Original Screenplay nomination, without question.I would also suggest to anyone that the DVD is an excellent source for information about each and every one of the people on United flight 93. The bios were very moving and poignant. I cannot say enough about the clear commitment to film-making that Greengrass showed to make this feature a part of the DVD.I salute the people who died on United 93 and Paul Greengrass for making a tragic, incredibly gripping and moving film.",10,4,7,9 September 2006
