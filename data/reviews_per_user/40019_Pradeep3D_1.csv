The Perks of Being a Wallflower," nicely performed
","not a regular teen movie, where all is about getting a girl/guy, sex , or drugs have more than that Emma , and Logan Lerman have done well and they carry the movie . the film have a good mood in itself , i would recommend to watch this movie alone and to enjoy the theme of film , at some points movie have some regular annoying spots but they were required and they were not stretched out , at all its a good movie to watch ,( it's my first review let me know hows it )",7,1,2,27 May 2017
