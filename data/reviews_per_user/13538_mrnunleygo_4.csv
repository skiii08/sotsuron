Angels & Demons," Good cast drowns in ridiculous plot
","If humanity makes it to the 2030s, this film a sure to be on the 2030s equivalent of Mystery Science Theater. I've got no problem with a good cast that faithfully labors to make this film watchable, but as others have noticed, the overall plot is patently absurd. Hero Tom Hanks chases the Illuminati, who appear to be the last true disciples of Rube Goldberg (youngsters, google it), who leave a ridiculously complicated trail of clues that have to be solved for their ultimate plan to work but who also do everything they can to prevent these clues from being solved (which is all part of the plan, but never mind). I have never put a spoiler in a review before, but this movie richly deserves at least one. There is a bomb that is supposedly as destructive as a five kiloton atomic bomb, but at the last minute it is carried out of range of doing any damage to anything. Uh, guys, judging from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a ONE kiloton bomb 1000 meters above the Vatican (which is as far as any helicopter could have ascended in just over two minutes) would have destroyed every building within a half mile radius and basically vaporized everyone in Saint Peter's Square. A FIVE kiloton bomb would have knocked down every building in Rome, with additional vaporisation. Yet when the bomb goes off, not one of the supposedly brilliant scholars present knows enough to ask 'Hey, why aren't we all dead?' Tom Hanks should at least have turned to his female companion and say 'Wow, you really f***ed up that prediction!' I'm sorry, but this is unconscionable. It actually makes me angry. It teaches the audience that atomic bombs are really not all that bad after all, in an era when people need to understand just how powerful these weapons actually are: and remember, hydrogen bombs are measured in megatons, and a megaton is 1000 times as powerful as a kiloton. Shame on the people who included this scene in their movie!",2,1,2,28 October 2016
La La Land," What it feels like
","La La Land is a special movie, and Damien Chazelle is to be congratulated for creating it. Each musical number is in some way an homage to a different previous type of Hollywood musical style. More significant, though, is the way this love story captures the progression of sensations experienced when you are simultaneously concerned about ambition/achievement and about love. The one criticism I've heard of the movie is that it's 'not realistic.' Really? Not realistic to have hundreds of people dancing and singing during a freeway stoppage? Who knew? The movie isn't trying to achieve realism; its artifices are transparent.. The point is to represent and, maybe more importantly, evoke in the audience the emotional moments that can occur during the trajectories of two sometimes intertwined, sometimes contradictory life goals: the desire for achievement and the desire for love.",9,1,1,2 June 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," I could deal with the SM, but not with the male lead
","This movie seemed preposterous to me. I mean, I've got no problem with the idea that some people are turned on by being dominant, even by inflicting pain, and I'm equally O.K. with the idea that others might be turned on by being submissive, or even (though more rarely) from receiving pain. But I can't get my head around the idea that a beautiful, sexy, smart, interesting woman like Anastasia (as portrayed by Dakota Johnson) would have any interest at all in a mindless, boring, selfish, cardboard cutout of a man like Christian. He has money. Great. That's always a plus. But is having money really enough to make up for his utter lack of any discernable personality? I don't understand what would motivate this woman to do anything she does.",2,1,3,3 February 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," What does she see in him?
","I actually wanted to like this movie, but the combination of a terrible script and a terrible lead actor doomed me to never be able to get past the obvious question: Why would an attractive, smart, charming young woman like this want to have anything to do with such an immature, insecure a-hole? I've got nothing against the specific sexual practices--hey, whatever gets you through the night--but the wooden (!) male character's insistence on being in control every second was profoundly off-putting and decidedly un-erotic. I did like the character portrayed by Dakota Johnson. I hope Johnson (as an actress) outlives this series and goes on to have respectable career. I'll give the movie 2 stars because the music was pretty good.",2,0,1,7 July 2019
