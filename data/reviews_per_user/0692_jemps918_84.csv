National Treasure: Book of Secrets," It wasn't a bad film, but it didn't bring anything new to the table
","I was pleasantly surprised by the first one, and with the excellent sequels that have recently come out, I was hoping this would at least match National Treasure. But National Treasure: Book of Secrets only did very incremental adjustments that did not even set out to improve its predecessor, lazily riding on the former's equity.It wasn't a bad film, but it didn't bring anything new to the table. Nicolas Cage isn't an amazing actor but since he uncannily gets the right movies at the right time, people go out and see his flicks anyway. But you cannot forgive him this time for reprising his role as treasure-seeker Ben Gates in such poorly-written fashion. Diane Kruger as his girlfriend Abigail Chase is still predictably bland when she could've used this opportunity to redeem herself, especially when her character now seems to have a penchant for stating the obvious instead of being the smartie she's supposed to be. But it's hard to hate Justin Bartha as the reliable comic relief Riley Poole, as well as the rest of the cast who seem to just be in this flick for the cash cow that it is.It all boils down to the shabby writing; seems like the writers were already on strike at this point! Having hinted at a Part 3 (and there haven't been very good Part 3s of the other movie franchises so far), I hope they use it to finally do something more clever and interesting.",7,2,5,12 January 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat magnifies the ridiculous and yet allows everyone to root for the ignorant anti-hero who only wants to have a 'sexy time'
","You can tell a lot about a person by the way they react to this movie. At the surface, Borat is a really funny movie about a Kazakhstani TV personality who goes on a cross-country trip in the 'US and A' (as he would like to say) and ends up going on a wild goose chase in search of Pamela Anderson. Get ready for lots of inappropriate, irreverent and shocking, crude behavior! But on another level, the brilliance of Borat is his ability to epitomize the very kind of people he is making a parody of. The movie speaks to everyone because we all have prejudices, just in different degrees of tolerance. As Borat continues to meet all kinds of characters in his trip, the audience learns a lot more about the people Borat meets, and secretly, about themselves if they venture enough to put themselves in the characters' shoes.Now that sounds like too much work for a cheesy documentary/satire, but that's how the movie appeals to a broad range of people on so many levels. One can take this movie and pass it off as crass, toilet humor, and yet one can also take the humor to be quite high-brow in kitschy packaging. Borat magnifies the ridiculous and yet allows everyone to root for the ignorant anti-hero who only wants to have a 'sexy time'.",8,2,8,11 November 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Christian Bale makes the rest of us want to believe that his kind of man still exists.
","The original version of this wonderfully done remake is probably the inspiration for 16 Blocks, S.W.A.T. and other similar movies. 3:10 to Yuma is about the complications in transit taking a prisoner from one place to another.Even non-fans of westerns should watch this if only for the extremely talented Christian Bale; watching any movie of his is surely time well spent. He always chooses to play interesting roles, and in 3:10 to Yuma, he plays Dan Evans, a poor, handicapped rancher who volunteers to be part of a rag tag team to take captured legendary outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to Yuma prison.James Mangold (Walk the Line, Identity) does an incredible job of directing the terrific cast. Ben Foster (X-Men: The Last Stand, 30 Days of Night) is a revelation as Charlie Prince, Wade's most loyal crew member, who will stop at nothing to rescue his captured leader en route to Yuma prison. Crowe is able to make his complicated character multi-dimensional in that he is both fearsome but someone you also secretly root for.Everyone does justice to the heart-wrenching script peppered with killer lines. In explaining his decision to take the prisoner on the dangerous journey, Dan frustratedly whispers to his wife Alice (Gretchen Mol), 'If I don't go, we gotta pack up and leave. Now I'm tired, Alice. I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way that they look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't.' In another pivotal scene between Dan and his teenage son (Logan Lerman), he says, 'Just remember, it's your old man that hauled Ben Wade to that station... when nobody else would.' Not all men in his situation will do what is right. Christian Bale makes the rest of us want to believe that his kind of man still exists.",9,2,4,2 November 2007
Marie Antoinette," Director Sofia Coppola turns voyeur in her version of the infamous
","Director Sofia Coppola turns voyeur in her version of the infamous Marie Antoinette. It reads straight out of a Wikipedia entry on the subject (the script is actually based on Antonia Fraser's book) but doesn't aim to educate; rather, it affords a glimpse of the young queen's human side, showing how she lived, which seemed to explain how she couldn't possibly have maliciously intended to ruin France.Kirsten Dunst was a good choice to play the teen queen; she was able to credibly transcend from a 15-year old to a more mature woman. She earnestly played her character, and endured the punishing, intimate shots of intense close-ups and disturbingly quiet scenes. Jason Schwartzman was also adequate in playing the role of Marie Antoinette's similarly young and inept king.The visuals are stunningly rich, with establishing shots straight out of Victorian paintings. The lush clothes, furniture, landscapes and light all delightfully intertwine into what is believably accurate and painfully shallow. For this, Coppola was able to successfully replicate the period better than other grayer, more formal period films. She patiently shot inordinately long scenes that allowed the audience to empathize with the awkward quiet and idleness of the time.Coppola's storytelling is disconcertingly quieter; reliant on the atmosphere, not on conversations. The creative choice of juxtaposing moody new wave music from the 1980s (supplied by Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, etc.) surprisingly fit the illustrative sequences. Even the acting took a back seat to fit the tableau, effectively showing that Marie Antoinette is not the central character after all, but a mere cog of French society. For this, Marie Antoinette, according to Coppola's candy flick, cannot be faulted, having only desperately and dutifully played her part.",7,1,3,4 November 2006
Deja Vu," Déjà vu has an interesting premise, and if you allow yourself to believe it then you will have fun.
","If you want to be entertained with visually stunning action and excitement, catch Déjà vu on the big screen, because that's the best way to view this incredible story from Terry Rossio (same writer of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Shrek, Zorro). Déjà vu has an interesting premise, and if you allow yourself to believe it then you will have fun.Tony Scott teams up once more with his fave leading man Denzel Washington, who comfortably fits into the role (although he overacts in one scene in an angry outburst). The rest of the cast is just as pretty: Jim Caviezel marvelously transforms into a credible villain (from playing Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ) and he is exceptionally handsome enough for the audience to both fear and be enamored by his sociopathic terrorist turn. Producer-turned-actress Paula Patton is beautifully exotic, which makes Denzel's decision to save her digestible. Val Kilmer also pulls his own weight, literally, putting on the pounds to amply play a supporting role. Adam Goldberg as stereotypical looking scientist provides welcome comic relief, aptly punctuating tense or boring scenes.Scott's trademark staccato editing and messy montages, which somehow amazingly doesn't confuse the viewers, was perfectly executed, as always, in this Bruckheimer action spectacular.",8,0,1,28 January 2007
Kung Fu Panda," Not as engaging as I thought it would be
","I was definitely excited to see Kung Fu Panda. I 'prepared for awesomeness' as its fun trailer suggested, but it wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. It opens with a stylized fight sequence that belongs more in highbrow children's books that thankfully ended after my first yawn.Po (voice by Jack Black) is an impressionable, fat panda who regularly daydreams about kung fu fighting as he helps his pop run their noodle shop. He finally gets to realize his dream when he is chosen to be trained by the great kung fu master Shifu (voice by Dustin Hoffman) to fight against the evil Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane), much to the chagrin of Shifu's highly trained posse of Tigress (voice by Angelina Jolie), Monkey (voice by Jackie Chan), Mantis (voice by Seth Rogen), Viper (voice by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voice by David Cross).It had truly awesome fight scenes (especially noteworthy Tai Lung's escape from prison) and its share of kung fu wisdom, but overall, the writing and illustration just wasn't as clever or as funny as it promised. The animals were plain and androgynous so their personalities were very reliant on their characters' voices, especially the Tigress (thanks to Jolie's unmistakably sultry voice). Only the panda had a wider variety of facial expressions, and only very few of his lines were able to elicit some chuckles from the adults in the audience. The children were more easily enamored.",6,4,18,5 June 2008
Superbad," an extended barrage of brainless fun
","Taking its cue from the burgeoning geek vogue, Superbad audiences will get what they came in for: an extended barrage of brainless fun.When they were still 13 years old, Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) and Evan Goldberg wrote the screenplay about two high school seniors, aptly named Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera), who are at a crossroads in their lives: slacker Seth will not be going to the same college as the more studious Evan, who will be going to Dartmouth. The boys deal with their separation anxiety on top of managing to get some illegally-obtained booze for a party they have miraculously been invited to by the girls of their dreams.Seth Rogen also appears as Officer Michaels and Bill Hader as Officer Slater, who somehow get embroiled after stumbling in on the hilarious attempt of Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to buy the booze with a fake ID posing as 'McLovin'.If you plan to enjoy this flick, leave all pretensions at the door. Superbad is what it is: the jokes are crass, but spot on. The connection between the best friends seem very genuine, so despite all the gross out moments, they still make for ridiculously fun geeks.",7,7,15,30 October 2007
Juno," A great feel-good movie!
","I love it! Not since Stranger Than Fiction have I thoroughly enjoyed a movie in this genre as much as Juno.It's a deceptively simple plot line (teenager gets knocked up and puts it up for adoption), but never has teen pregnancy been portrayed in such a comedic yet sweet manner. Sure, the dialogue is too witty and clever to be mouthed off by practically the entire cast but that's part of the reason why Juno is such a nice surprise; it's self-effacing and doesn't take itself too seriously but bothers to leave a great message anyway.Playing the titular character is Ellen Page, who is wonderful as an incredibly pretty tomboy who looks like she's straight out of a Judy Blume book. The rest of the cast are just as amazing: Michael Cera (Superbad, Arrested Development) plays Paulie Bleeker, the unassuming geek-next-door who knocks up Juno, Rainn Wilson (The Office) as the acerbic storekeeper Rollo, Jennifer Garner (Alias) as eager mum-to-be Vanessa Loring and Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) as her hubby stuck-in-the-90s Mark. Even the parent characters (Allison Janney as stepmom Bren and J.K. Simmons as Juno's dad Mac) who are normally stereotyped get their share of the good lines.The direction of Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking) is wonderfully light and moody, matching the offbeat but lovable script by stripper-turned-screenwriter Diablo Cody. The soundtrack, set and costume design all helped fortify the overarching mood of this feel-good movie. I look forward to seeing more material from Reitman, Cody or Page!",10,6,14,6 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Now this is how to make a Part Three!
","Now this is how to make a Part Three! Where Spiderman, Batman and other franchises failed in wowing critics (maybe not so much the eager escapist audiences) with a third installment of a popular series, director Gore Verbinski succeeds in showing just how to stretch the excitement and enthusiasm even further.Yes, the movie was long, but you wouldn't feel it so much with all the swashbuckling action going on, the subplots that hint at more important things to come, and the witty repartee (although some might need subtitles to decipher dialogue spoken with thick accents).It would be helpful to review the two previous Pirates movies to appreciate the characters and the story more, and so would an ample background on popular mythology (I had to keep explaining to my moviemates what happened in the past two flicks).Sure, as the plot unravels, things get more obvious but you don't mind this because the movie unfolds exactly as you would've pictured it. The sets, the costumes, the attention to detail are all impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 was definitely entertaining.The cast looks as if they were all just having fun: Johnny Depp reprises his role as the oddball Captain Jack Sparrow and shows once more what a wonderful physical comedic actor he is; Orlando Bloom as Will Turner finally looks more manly than the scrappy metrosexual he's always playing; Keira Knightley could have used better dialogue but at least she's finally put on just a little bit more weight to make her look healthier and more convincing as the strong-willed Elizabeth Swann. Watch out for the much celebrated Pinoy Reggie Lee (from Prison Break, Fast and the Furious) as Chow Yun-Fat's main man, as well as Keith Richards, who makes a satisfyingly quirky cameo as Sparrow's dad.Oh, and stay till the last of the looong credits roll for a sneak peek at a possible fourth movie, but Pirates 3 can honestly already stand on its own ending with this flick.",8,3,5,27 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks
","Attended the sunrise screening of Spidey 3 in Alabang and the place was buzzing with excitement. It was most fortunate to premiere the film open on a holiday (May 1) because it was pretty packed.The verdict: not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks, but it's recommended viewing anyway just so you can form your own opinion on it.True Spiderman comic fans might be disappointed to see that a lot of what's in the main comicbook story lines and characterizations were not dutifully translated on screen. The movie also runs on too long, but nevertheless, the special effects are amazing.We also get to see a more human side of Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) developing a split personality: Plain vs. Mod Peter Parker/Spidey. In this installment, Spidey's fame inexplicably gets to his head, much to his girlfriend MJ (Kirsten Dunst)'s dismay. He comes across an alien symbiote that attaches itself to him and feeds his darker, more aggressive side.We get a few laughs when Peter embraces this more vengeful side of him, and his style suddenly gets more mod: dark eyeliner, dark skinny suits, sleek parted hair. He looks like he belongs in an alternative/punk/rock band, complete with the attitude.Meanwhile, the villains were pretty impressive: Goblin Jr. (James Franco) battles it out with Spidey to avenge his father's death. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) plays the powerful, indestructible and ever elusive Sandman, while Topher Grace (That 70s Show, In Good Company) plays Parker's nemesis Eddie Brock/Venom. However, there are quite a number of plot holes (like, how come Peter can control the symbiote as a suit but on Eddie it attaches itself fully and gives him really bad teeth?).The movie entertained the kids in some parts, but the natives grew increasingly restless as the movie culminates to a flat close. It was as if director Sam Raimi just wanted to throw everything in there. Nonetheless, this movie is pretty sure to rake in the big bucks just with all the hype alone.",7,4,10,1 May 2007
Yes Man," Free-spirited fun!
","Yes Man is free-spirited fun! Yes, it's a bit of a romantic comedy between two polar opposites 18 years apart but it wasn't all that gross. Yes, it's formulaic but it's also seriously funny.Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a recently divorced junior loan officer. Wallowing in his misery, his vocabulary is comprised of all variations of 'no'. He meets an old acquaintance, who convinces him to attend a life-changing seminar that is centered on saying 'yes'. Carl gives it a try, and ends up meeting Allison (Zooey Deschanel) as a result of his newfound way of life. Whenever he says no, though, things seem to take a turn for the worse. Or do they really? Deschanel is great for this sort of quirky role, and while the rubber-faced Carrey has aged a lot, he can still deliver the punchlines and play the role of leading man. When Carl breaks into song ('Jumper' by Third Eye Blind), and the onlookers yell the power line back, 'Put the past away!' it's priceless.It's uncanny how much I can relate to Yes Man. Even before I heard of the movie (which was only this year) or of the book (a biography by Danny Wallace), I had already tagged the year 2008 as the Year of the Yes for me, which meant accepting all sorts of dates and invites to trips and doing things I would not normally do. Just like Carl, this little change of perspective worked wonders for me. More than a little excursion out of my comfort zone, it opened up possibilities. It wasn't all good all the time, but it's definitely worth extending to 2009 as the Year of the Why Not!",8,2,3,26 January 2009
Zodiac," Only after enduring almost 3 hrs was I able to understand the necessary length
","Only after enduring the 2 hrs and 40 odd minutes director David Fincher took to unravel Zodiac was I able to understand the necessary length. It shared with the audience the feelings of frustration, anticipation, helplessness, fear and need for closure, which does not always happen.Jake Gyllenhaal turns in another sparkling performance as Robert Graysmith, newspaper cartoonist and later obsessive author of the book on which the movie is based. Mark Ruffalo uglies up his mug to convincingly play David Toschi, one of the inspectors assigned to the case. Robert Downey Jr. is in his element as the charming rogue journalist Paul Avery, who covers the Zodiac killer's beat on the paper. John Carroll Lynch very eerily plays suspected Zodiac killer Arthur Leigh Allen.Things don't always make sense but that is the ugly, unedited truth of murder of this serial variety, especially seeing it in context, in this age of hi-tech CSI-type shows. This movie shows not only how the deaths affect the victims' families but also how dangerous obsessions on such cases, while not exactly original (Black Dahlia, etc.) can consume even bystanders and those not directly involved.",8,5,9,11 June 2007
The Prestige," Brilliant! This movie will haunt you days after seeing it.
","Brilliant! This movie will haunt you days after seeing it. While having only a few films under his belt (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia), trust Christopher Nolan to produce, write and direct films only of this extraordinary depth and caliber.Another thing to clue you in on how marvelous The Prestige is: the exceptional cast. Premiere cult actor Christian Bale (also of Batman Begins, American Psycho) convincingly switches from ruthless to charming as the richly layered magician Borden that rivals multi-talented Hugh Jackman's suave but obsessive Angier. Michael Caine as their subtly complex assistant, David Bowie as the eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla and Rebecca Hall as Borden's quietly suffering wife all add to the tension, mystery and suspension of disbelief that make The Prestige such a success. Scarlett Johanssen is the only one who unfortunately becomes just the cherry that tops all the eye candy, but her screen presence is unquestionable.This is Nolan's best piece to date: his film-making resonates the magical theme, the dark, moody textures of the period, and the fragmented storytelling. He mirrors the obsessive, fiercely competitive magicians on screen, by showcasing his expertise in using flashbacks and foreshadowing; each framed element carefully placed, everything connecting to the beautifully poignant end.The Prestige hooks you in from the very first scene of the mysterious mountain of top hats; you allow its stunning imagery, characters and storyline to seduce you into its enigmatic world and leave you enthralled but aching for more when the credits roll and the evocatively appropriate soundtrack 'Analyse' by Radiohead's Thom Yorke stays with you long after your cinematic experience. Nolan's slick sleight-of-hand demo proves that commercial efforts need not be blithe, campy or depressing to also be critically acclaimed.",10,2,3,4 November 2006
Cloverfield," if you have no imagination, you will not enjoy Cloverfield
","Scary fun! The cryptic trailers delivered an efficient thriller in Cloverfield. While it has gotten a lot of flak for the believability factor (hello, it's a monster movie) and for the shaky cam visual style ala Blair Witch Project, the audience anticipation has a great deal to do with the reception of the film (i.e. if you have no imagination, you will not enjoy Cloverfield).Just like Godzilla was successful having been released right after the war, as it was used as a symbol of helpless doom, Cloverfield resonates with audiences and becomes relevant in light of terrorism. I was just hoping they wouldn't show the monster so much because just glimpsing parts of it is more terrifying than seeing it for what it is because seeing it in its entirety wasn't as frightening for me as, say, the creatures in Alien.As for the camcorder cinematography, it does take getting used to. I usually get dizzy quickly, but I find that it helped to involve myself in the movie by imagining I was there, too. Silly, eh? But it sure beats motion sickness!",8,0,1,2 February 2008
Dear John," Channing Tatum is the sole reason to see this
","Channing Tatum (She's the Man, Step Up) is the only reason to sit through this unbelievably awful movie. Without eye candy like him, this would absolutely tank. Expect to burst into embarrassing fits of giggles when the actors try very, very hard to make you feel sorry for them and endure the disapproving dagger looks of die-hard Nicholas Sparks fans in the process.But what can you expect from yet another Sparks weeper? The popular novelist relies heavily on his trademark tragic love stories (A Walk to Remember, The Notebook), and in his latest effort Dear John, he laments about John Tyree (Tatum), a young marine who falls for Savannah Curtis (Mamma Mia's Amanda Seyfried), a too-good-to-be-true college co-ed, in the two weeks he's home on leave. They decide to pursue their long distance romance and he promises to leave the Army after a year. Alas, 9/11 occurs and he is forced to extend his service indefinitely. Can Savannah wait for him any further while he tries to avoid getting killed? Even Oscar-nominated director Lasse HallstrÃ¶m (Chocolat, The Shipping News, The Cider House Rules) could not spin his magic with the terrible material he has to work with, and yet surprisingly, this movie has done very well at the tills. Go figure.",2,4,11,11 February 2010
Knocked Up," it is shockingly funny but some might feel tricked to discover that there are more pockets of drama and romance than the target audience would normally sign up for
","As it is irreverently and grossly hilarious, don't make the mistake of watching this with your parents. Seth Rogen (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) plays ultimate slacker Ben who gets the camera-friendly and otherwise level-headed E! News correspondent Alison (played by Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy) pregnant. Astonishingly, Alison decides to try and make it work with Ben despite having zilch in common, for their baby's sake.Rogen plays his character well, with no insecurity and with a wicked amount of confidence playing Heigl's unlikely beau. The kids who play Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) children are Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's (the director) real children, and they are incredibly charming and deliver their lines without any annoying trace of self-consciousness.While Knocked Up is marketed as a comedy grossfest, it is surprisingly also much more. For the most part, it is shockingly funny but some might feel tricked to discover that there are more pockets of drama and romance than the target audience would normally sign up for.",6,5,10,23 October 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Memorable
","Based on Stephen Sondheim's hit Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a classic revenge story ala Zorro or Count of Monte Cristo (DOM steals humble hunk's wife and child) but told in bloodthirsty gory, er, glory.Wrongfully accused barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) goes back home to London with vendetta on his mind as Sweeney Todd, barber extraordinaire. Somehow, the townspeople don't seem to find his and fellow tenant Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter)'s ghoulish looks any stranger than her meat pies. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) is the insidious old geezer who steals Barker's wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and now has evil designs for his daughter! The rest of the supporting cast gave memorable performances. Sacha Baron Cohen adds a fun albeit short stint as Todd's competitor, Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Timothy Spall (who once more plays the villain's sidekick as in Enchanted) is the judge's disgustingly evil lackey Beadle Bamford. Ed Sanders as the poor orphan boy Toby is an incredibly bright and talented surprise. Jamie Campbell Bower as the lovestruck sailor Anthony Hope appears in the very first scene with Depp and even as the film unravels, his tenor voice and effeminate looks has the audience wrestling with his gender. He looks a lot like Claire Danes or Hanson's lead singer, especially when he does the trademark Danes facial expression of the furrowed forehead. Jayne Wisener plays the 15-year old Johanna, Barker's daughter all grown up. Despite her satisfactory acting chops, she is shockingly blond with an annoying soprano voice that it's hard to see her as the beauty she is supposed to be.Even with Hollywood's latest character-role fave Johnny Depp as the star and one of my fave directors Tim Burton at the helm, musicals even in film form is still unsavory for me. But Burton succeeds in sneaking Sweeney Todd into your thoughts long after you've left the cinema. It's good to confirm that I have not been desensitized after seeing so much gore, and I'm even happier that violence was not glorified in this film despite gory images being the staple in each scene.",7,0,1,20 January 2008
Blades of Glory," exactly what you expect it to becrazy funnyso be careful not to choke on your popcorn!
","Will Ferrell brings the funny back in the expectedly hootworthy flick Blades of Glory as men's figure skating bad boy on ice, Chazz Michael Michaels. Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite, The Benchwarmers) plays Chazz's nemesis, skating prodigy Jimmy MacElroy. In a competition, the two had to share the men's single's gold medal, and so a fight ensues between the archrivals, which leads to their being banned from men's competitive figure skatingin the single's division, that is! Jimmy's crazed fan discovers a loophole in the rules, which enables the two to team up to compete in partner skating, much to the displeasure of skating sibling sensations Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (played by real-life husband and wife SNL stars Will Arnett and Amy Poehler). They coerce their sister Katie (played by The Office's Jenna Fischer) into spying for them, but she ends up falling for the competition.As always, Ferrell irreverently ad-libs his way throughout the movie; hence, the need for the remarkably alert cast to react and play able foil to his spontaneous bursts of hilarity. Heder holds his own as Ferrell's competent sidekick with his earnest portrayal of his character.Blades of Glory is exactly what you expect it to becrazy funnyso be careful not to choke on your popcorn!",8,0,2,18 June 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," delivers lots of shallow fun and allows the audience some 'inside joke' humor, more effectively translating this feeling than the previous Ocean's 12
","Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and the rest of the Ocean's cast directed by Steven Soderbergh comes back for thirds in what seems to be another enjoyably shot slick flick.Danny Ocean (played by the elegantly aging Clooney) rallies the boys to bring down casino owner Willy Bank (played by Al Pacino), who double-crossed one of Ocean's eleven, the elderly and too-trusting Reuben.In Ocean's Thirteen, notably absent are screen divas Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones (how can they realistically top that power tandem?!), but Ellen Barkin resurrects herself as the mature (by Hollywood standards) but sexy Abigail Sponder, Bank's second in command and the film's lone female lead. While she was obviously not meant to replace Roberts and Zeta-Jones, I'm glad they chose her; no young starlet could possibly compare.The movie still delivers lots of shallow fun and allows the audience some 'inside joke' humor, more effectively translating this feeling than the previous Ocean's 12. Clooney gets to plug his social responsibility angle; Pitt gets to continue to eat in each scene; Damon enjoys more screen time as the eager to please Linus; while the rest of the gang pretty much lends likable support roles. Then again, Ocean's team is a bunch of affable thieves who always get what they want; their charming, sociopathic appeal makes their audience want to see them succeed.",8,1,4,11 June 2007
Gone Baby Gone," It would be no surprise to see Ben Affleck up for another Oscar
","It would be no surprise to see Ben Affleck up for another Oscar this year, this time for his directorial debut of Gone Baby Gone. Ben's also back flexing his Academy-award winning writing muscles as he co-writes the story (based on Dennis Lehane's novel) with Aaron Stockard.Brother Casey Affleck is out of his shadow and is wonderfully credible as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator in working class Boston, hired along with his girlfriend and fellow PI Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan) by the family of a missing four-year-old girl to help find her.The luminously beautiful Monaghan (of MI3, Made of Honor, The Bourne Supremacy) turns in an understated performance, and the rest of the cast amply provides support. Morgan Freeman as Capt. Jack Doyle is back playing a character he does best (God). Ed Harris as Det. Remy Bressant is gritty and compelling as an officer you either love or hate. Broadway actress Amy Ryan is scarily accurate in her portrayal of the missing girl's druggie mother Helene McCready.As the story unfolds, lots of twists and fake endings abound, but is nevertheless unraveled well on screen, with enough pockets for personal musing. Can the end ever justify the means? That would just be one of the many 'What would YOU have done?' questions that will continue to hound you way after the movie.",9,2,5,3 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Matt Damon was born to play Jason Bourne!
","Matt Damon was born to play Jason Bourne! His is not a pretty boy mug but it's likable and interesting enough, intelligence, earnestness and determination is alive in his eyes, and he has a bod that seems developed by actual fights and not by some cushy gym, all of which comprise a winning combination that makes him believable as Hollywood's fave spy of the season. Julia Stiles reprises her role as CIA Nicky Parsons. She finally has a meatier role in this installment of the Bourne series, and she proves she is built of equally strong stuff, not necessarily physically, as she holds her own screen presence with Damon. The tension and mystery is sustained (are they ex-lovers? Siblings? Partners?) and her wordless expressions are just as raw and powerful as Damon's adrenaline-pumping fight scenes.Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, Bourne Supremacy) really made the most of the singular, tying-it-all-together plot, despite it having a not exactly neat ending. The supporting cast is just as solid: Albert Finney as the mysterious Dr. Albert Hirsch who recurs in Bourne's flashbacks, Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, the most powerful woman in the CIA who knows how Bourne operates best, and David Strathairn as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen is so hateful you could imagine him to probably be the kid everyone picked on in school.The action sequences and the spartan storyline is refreshingly old school and you don't feel manipulated in a way that the effects are out to wow you. You just feel for Bourne as he tries to discover who he really is, even if it means ending everything he's known for the past three years that he's lost his identity.The series are just based on the Bourne books by Robert Ludlum, so don't bother comparing the two because they are not identical (i.e. Nicky is said to not be in any of the books); appreciate them separately.",9,1,3,24 August 2007
21," Great soundtrack!
","The soundtrack is pretty darn good! And yes, the movie is entertaining, too. But Young Folks by Peter, Bjorn and John, You Can't Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones (Re-Mixed), and L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) by Mark Ronson featuring Kasabian definitely add to the overall appeal of 21, along with other amazing tracks.Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) is terrific as MIT geek Ben Campbell desperate for a Harvard Med scholarship. He gets chosen to join the underground elite team of blackjack-playing smarties after impressing his non-linear equations prof Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). Beauty and brains Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) can't help but fall for Ben, who is not only achingly cute, but can also impressively do the math. Trouble ensues when casino consultant Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) gets suspicious.Directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde), 21 is said to deviate a lot from the book Bringing Down the House on which it is based, but effectively tells a proper story nonetheless. Aside from another white guy, the rest of the crew is Asian American (Korean and Filipino). However, the real Ben Campbell is Jeffrey Ma (who has a bit part as Planet Hollywood Dealer Jeff), and the rest of the real characters are mostly of Asian descent, too. But this is still a Hollywood flick, after all, so this product must be sold in the way producers (which includes Spacey) see fit.",8,0,1,18 May 2008
Wanted," Incredibly hedonistic, Wanted is an adrenaline rush
","Wow! Russian director Timur Bekmambetov sure made an impressive Hollywood debut with this wantonly executed action flick. Wanted will blow you away with its unbelievably slick action sequences and satisfactorily unique story loosely based on a Mark Millar comic.James McAvoy (Atonement, Last King of Scotland) pulls it off as Wesley Gibson, an anxiety-ridden cubicle drone with a boring billings job. His life turns 180-degrees when he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie), a hot assassin who clues him in on who he really is. Both are believable in their roles and feed off each other's energy. The supporting cast isn't too shabby either, except maybe for too trite casting choice of Morgan Freeman as the leader of the Fraternity of Assassins, but I'm just nitpicking.Incredibly hedonistic, Wanted is an adrenaline rush. Gory, yes, but violence shouldn't be glamorized anyway, so if you enjoy it, you better put up with it. Look forward to the sequel, which is already in the works. Meanwhile, Bekmambetov's famed vampire series may be worth checking out till then.",8,8,16,28 June 2008
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Whattariot!
","Thank God the sequel to 2005's 'Madagascar' turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. Part Twos are usually scary territory, but I daresay this one outdid its predecessor in terms of storyline and packing in the laughs.It starts where Madagascar One ended: Central Park Zoo animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) find themselves still stranded and eager to leave the island. The penguins have built a plane and successfully take off for NY when they crash land in the African wilderness. The NY Zoo animals try to fit in with their wild counterparts and encounter situations that challenge their friendship.Of course King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), the surprisingly scene-stealing granny and the rest of the supporting cast provide added hilarity and wit to almost every repartee. Even more welcome was the relevant uplifting theme, which served as an effective sub-plot, an important message delivered in a fun, non-preachy way. If they intend to rollout a Part Three, this would be a tough one to beat!",9,20,36,20 November 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," bawdy, irreverent
","If you are in the mood for some bawdy, irreverent laughs, then watch Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, a spoof on Walk the Line, Ray and other literal rockstar slice-of-life clichés (pardon the pun; you'll get what I mean ;o)).Shocking scenes arise as expected from co-writer Judd Apatow (40 year old virgin, Superbad, Knocked Up), and are tremendously funny especially in the beginning. As the movie progresses, however, some hilarity wanes, but impressive are the prosthetic make-up appendages everyone sports as the movie spans from the time Cox is 6 until he is 71 years old. It's good that Oscar nominee John C. Reilly (Chicago, Talladega Nights) finally gets to headline a movie, after seemingly forever portraying the reliable sidekick or supporting character in his many, many movies.From playing a mousy receptionist in the TV sitcom The Office and the mousy sister in Blades of Glory, Jenna Fischer turns in a surprisingly sexy and laugh-out-loud performance as Cox's back-up singer and second wife Darlene. Her comic timing is great and amply supports Reilly's antics because she plays her role so straightly. As an aside, she looks like Buffy's Sarah Michelle Gellar with all the makeup.Nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Cox's anthemic 'Walk Hard', the melodic hooks of the rest of the songs are memorable, but the lyrics, suggestive or otherwise, prove the real riot. Also welcome are the cameos from Eddie Vedder, Jack White, Jack Black, The Temptations, Jewel, Lyle Lovett, comics Chris Parnell, Kristin Wiig, and bit parts for Jonah Hill, Frankie Muniz, Jason Schwartzman, Justin Long, Paul Rudd and others.",7,1,2,12 March 2008
Disturbia," a hip homage to Rear Window
","Disturbia is an updated, teen version of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Rear Window.Shia LaBeouf (Transformers, I Robot) is Kale, who is placed under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher for a barbed comment about his father, whom Kale lost in an accident. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix, Memento) is frustrated, trying to find out how to keep her rebellious son at bay. Moss is underutilized but her subtle, loaded acting is effective (I've associated her so much as Trinity in The Matrix that I keep expecting her to morph into something other than the hapless housewife she plays).Good thing Kale's best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) can be relied on for comic relief and indulges Kale's voyeuristic exploits (no iPod, no TV, no PC; what's a boy to do?).Their fave neighbor to spy on is new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Perpetually bored and longing for some summer action, she teams up with the boys as they play stakeout in Kale's room, trying to get to the bottom of what Kale insists is murder by Kale's neighbor Mr. Turner (played chillingly by David Morse).The dialogue is painfully earnest and realistic despite the outrageous situation. The members of the cast are likable and turned in strong performances (especially LaBeouf). Disturbia works because it involves its audience and is refreshingly sincere in its delivery. It unravels like a hip homage to Rear Window and doesn't try too hard to be liked, despite being mainstream in execution.",8,0,0,27 August 2007
Step Up 2: The Streets," Entertaining and enjoyable; even to non-hiphop fans
","Entertaining and enjoyable; even to non-hiphop fans (like me), if you're eager to see something fun and new. Step Up 2: The Streets does not pretend to have a major plot and achieves its goal of delivering a good number of well choreographed dance teasers to keep you patient for the grand finale, even with the incredibly blah dialogue.This version will obviously be compared to its predecessor Step Up, which was unexpectedly delightful. The plot is still trite but while the former focused on second chances and the chemistry of its likable leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum), the story in Step Up 2, focused on an issue (encapsulated in the movie's tagline: It's not where you're from. It's where you're at), however, the cast, albeit obviously talented, lacked the charisma of the former movie's stars.Andie (Briana Evigan) is the usual rebel without a cause, with a way-fierce underground dance crew 410. To connect the first movie into this one, Tyler (Tatum) returns as her pseudo-big brother who sets her straight by beating her at a dance-off. Andie has to stay in an uptight school for the arts and runs into resident boy-band looker Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman), who also happens to be the director Blake Collins (Will Kemp)' brother and ex-boyfriend to the school's triple threat (sings, dances and acts) Sophie (played by singer Cassie Ventura). Teen drama ensues culminating in the street dance contest.Evigan is charming enough and talented because she doesn't dance self-consciously. Hoffman is great but his face just isn't as handsome as Kemp, who was brilliant but seemed too young for the role. Cassie doesn't get to showcase the wunderkind she was supposed to be and just has a few snivelly moments of longing. Of all the comic relief characters painfully included, the season of the cool nerd has truly arrived as Moose (Adam Sevani), a David Spade-ish character, gets to be the hip geek. Sadly, the Asian stereotype is still unbroken, with Jenny Kido (Mari Koda)'s character of weirdo with the accent. Well, at least they didn't make her a karate kid, cello prodigy or a math whiz.",6,1,4,16 March 2008
Ratatouille," Absolutely adorable! Mindblowingly impressive! You will fall in love with this movie!
","Absolutely adorable! Ratatouille deserves all the praise, ever! Pixar just continues to raise the bar and go beyond our expectations with this heartwarming yet incredibly funny gem of a flick.The level of detail and the rich texture of each scene is mindblowingly impressive. The voice characterizations especially by Patton Oswalt, Brad Garrett and Janeane Garofalo are well-directed accompaniments to the surprisingly earnest story that is sure to appeal to adult audiences as well. The animation and cinematography is amazingly sensitive, not showy at all but instead well motivated, effectively giving the audience a feel of what it's like to be Ratatouille's star, Chef Remy, who just so happens to be a rat.It is difficult not to be smitten by the range of complex emotions and situations as he is torn between his family and his passion for creating culinary masterpieces in a human world where he is despised in by default.Just like the movie's fiercest critic, The Grim Eater, it will be close to impossible not to fall in love with this movie. His character provides a pleasantly unexpected but fitting ending with his final review, and what he says is sure to resonate with critics everywhere. It sure hit the food and film critic in me! After all, it is a unique task, to be passing judgment, and Ratatouille is a creative offering worth going back to again and again.",10,6,9,25 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," I have mixed feelings about this
","With its wacky trailer, I was really looking forward to Tropic Thunder. My verdict: I have mixed feelings. It's as if a schizo created this flick. When it's funny, it's really funny; but these moments are not sustained (and not in the way where it is poised to just recharge to setup for more laughs). There are (gasp!) draggy parts and the plot refuses to engage the audience, who thankfully snaps back just in time for the punchlines, which border on sick and irreverent.Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller, who also directed and co-wrote the film with Justin Theroux) is a fading action superstar who jumpstarting his career with his co-stars Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.), comic Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), by going to Southeast Asia to film the 'biggest, most-expensive war movie ever produced'. But when things go wrong (as they often do), they draw on their artistic mettle to do battle as real soldiers when they face a fierce drug ring in the middle of the jungle. Downey, Jr. is the scene-stealer in this flick and spews out more of the wit as a blonde and blue-eyed Australian trying to stay in character to be a convincing black.Also worth noting are the fake trailers at the start of the movie. Matthew McConaughey as Speedman's overzealous agent; Nick Nolte as the badass writer Four Leaf Tayback, on which the movie was supposedly based; and Tom Cruise as the balding, fat but fierce producer Les Grossman are surprisingly hilarious in their supporting roles. Impressively consistent is the talented Brandon Soo Hoo as the scary child-drug-lord Tran. Also watch out for a bunch of cameos from Tobey Maguire, Tyra Banks, Jon Voight, Jennifer Love Hewitt and more.",6,0,1,20 October 2008
Enchanted," Kind of disenchanting...
","Kind of disenchanting...I heard great reviews about 'the great Disney comeback' but only the chipmunk sidekick Pip really delivered the laughs.Enchanted starts as an animated flick, and the audience is on board for how it would transition to reality. However, the cheesy cartoon, which is obviously meant to be a spoof, just dragged on too long for comfort.Amy Adams is a terrific actress and immersed in the character Giselle, but she looked way too old (at 33!) for the role. The grand transformation scene was anticlimactic; she looked dull and her lackluster, understated purple dress made her look washed out. Her plain but mercifully expressive face simply isn't beautiful enough, but her acting carried her all the way through.Patrick Dempsey is perfect as the tired, cynical lawyer Robert Philip, and so is Rachel Covey, who plays his shy child Morgan., who is forced to mature too soon. Covey is thankfully not annoying for a child actor and actually brought dimension to her character. James Marsden was great as the conceited, swashbuckling Prince Edward, while Susan Sarandon indeed looked evil as the villainous Queen Narissa.It's targeted more for children and is not as funny as Shrek or even Over the Hedge. If you hate singing in movies, not even when spoofed, you also might not take to Enchanted very kindly.",6,2,12,26 November 2007
Quantum of Solace," Not bad...
","I actually liked the title theme song by Jack White and Alicia Keys; I thought it was modern, evocative and punchy, not too dramatic. Or perhaps because I respond well to the White Stripes' brand of music. But while the sexy sand women were cool it wasn't as imaginative as Casino Royale's. Goldeneye's theme song is the most brilliant for me, I think.As for the villains, I think General Medrano was overshadowed by the creepy Dominic Greene, played by the peerless Mathieu Amalric (The Diving Bell & the Butterfly). Casino Royale's first half was also more action packed and impressive with its parkour exhibition but Quantum of Solace is more consistent in its exposition.Bond-girl wise, only Fields (Gemma Arterton) played it 'the usual way'. Olga Kurylenko (Paris, je t'aime, Hit-man, Max Payne) looked the unbelievable part of the usual model-with-an-agenda Camille but the lack of chemistry with Daniel Craig's Bond makes their tandem only shrug-worthy. At least Craig is finally slowly transforming into the role and isn't looking as primitive and thug-ish as he did in Casino Royale; he now looks more comfortable in a suit or out of it.Overall, I think Quantum of Solace succeeded in cleverly staying away from the misogynistic theme while still retaining a little bit of the old fantasy image of James Bond, ladies' man. The old Bond flicks may be classics but aren't politically correct (even satirically), lending it a dated DOM-ish air. I think the brilliant direction of Marc Forster (Stranger than Fiction, Kite Runner, Monsters Ball) is what gave this franchise a bit more depth than usual.",7,1,2,11 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Unorthodox, memorable, thought-provoking
","There is nothing mainstream about Oscar Best Picture winner No Country for Old Men, so don't expect a crowd-pleaser.Unorthodox in its pacing, derisive humor, thought-provoking sequences and uh, weaponry, directors Ethan and Joel Coen leave a lot for the audience's interpretation (reportedly more illuminated in the book by Cormac Macarthy) but throws in a number of memorable scenes.Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a hunter that stumbles upon a case of cash from a drug-deal gone wrong. He makes the mistake of returning to the scene of the crime and the hunter becomes the hunted: by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the police led by Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) and the Mexican mafia.Bardem deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. You will think twice about laughing at a guy with a bowl cut again, nor someone that seems to innocently be holding a gas tank with a hose. He will also come to mind the next time you encounter a coin toss. In fact, his character steals so much from the rest of the movie that his face is all this movie's poster has to fill.Not that the rest of the cast don't deliver. It's just that it unravels so slowly, it's only in scenes where he appears that you sit up and really watch. Jones surprisingly plays a weak character here, and Harrelson has a small part, too (but apparently a personal one). Kelly Macdonald is a revelation as Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean, who stands her own against Anton in their fateful meeting.The ending begs another discussion altogether.",7,2,3,25 February 2008
Mamma Mia!," Thankfully funny!
","The promise of seeing Pierce Brosnan in less than debonair digs got me over the icky sensation that I was about to watch a musical. That and finally putting to rest my dad's nonstop haranguing over how hilarious Mamma Mia: The Movie is.Soon-to-be-married Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in Corsica with her hippie mom Donna (Meryl Streep). She's never met her father, and so when she stumbles upon Donna's diary and discovers her three possible dads (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård), she invites them to her wedding. They all arrive unaware of her designs; rather, they are drawn by fond memories of their relationships with Donna. Hit songs by the '70s Swedish group ABBA provide both the soundtrack and the storyline.Streep is a surprise with her emotionally charged singing and sprightly steps, especially in bittersweet sequence The Winner Takes It All. Her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) were very able sidekicks and provided most of the laughs. Seyfried was unimpressive at first but either she's the sort of beauty that grows on you or her make-up and wardrobe just kept getting better as the movie progressed. Her character was infectiously optimistic and confidently carefree that it's difficult not to share in her excitement. The talented Dominic Cooper (History Boys) plays Sophie's fiancé, Sky; he stands out despite the tiny role. The rest of the cast were silly and ridiculous, just as tacky as it all should be.Hearing Brosnan burst into song was v. awkward (God is fair!) but he was perfect for the role of the dashingly handsome architect Sam. Firth is adorable as the head-banging rocker turned staid banker Harry Bright, while Skarsgård was delightfully unpretentious.The many production numbers were painful to watch but giving in to the kitsch will alleviate the pain. Mamma Mia! will definitely be appreciated by baby boomers.",8,1,3,21 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," powerful, poetic, compelling
","The title already tells the whole story and yet The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford still manages to enamor its audience with its powerful, poetic cinematography and compelling acting that you will forgive its flaws, which are few.Director Andrew Dominik really took his time (2.6 hours!), but this is established early on, and lulls you into the idyllic environs of the time. You realize later on that this was necessary, as this helps set up the unexpected moments.Playing Robert Ford is Casey Affleck, who is arguably nominated for an Oscar for Best Performance Supporting Actor when he was practically the lead. He was perfect for the role: his cracking voice and shifty manner, his feeble, irksome and spineless performance is exceptional, reminiscent of The Talented Mr. Ripley. He is able to mix showing his deep awe and fear of his childhood idol Jesse James, played by Brad Pitt.For the first time, Pitt becomes the character he plays in the movie and it's unnerving. He was the perfect mix of charismatic yet scary; you don't know when he'll snap so you're also kept on your toes just like the others around him. Disturbed, suspicious and agitated, he could be smooth and suave one moment, then unleash his wrath so quickly. Even when he had no lines, his face and gestures spoke volumes. You could imagine feeling very vulnerable, the way he'd look at people when he's trying to figure out if they were lying. He is at once tormented, charming, and terrifying.Pitt and Affleck successfully translate the complexities on screen: Jesse James is the fierce bandit who made people uneasy yet is able to evoke compassion; Robert Ford tries so hard to please buts ends up forgettable and despised.The attention given to the rest of the cast, which includes Sam Rockwell (as Robert's brother Charley), Mary-Louise Parker (as Jesse's wife Zee), and Sam Shepard (as Jesse's brother Frank) was distracting but they deserve their screen time. Roger Deakins must win the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar for his work in this film, as he expertly toyed between the stark, Spartan settings during the day and the more gritty scenery at night.",8,2,5,19 February 2008
Twilight," Cheesefest!
","When you can live forever, what do you live for? is one of the themes of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel with the cult-like female fan base, the latest of a string of much-awaited pop lit-based flicks to explode on screen.The first of a series of four, Twilight is told from the point-of-view of high school transferee Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), an ordinary girl from Arizona, who risks everything when she falls for teen vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The reluctant beau realizes he has bitten off more than he could chew (pardon the pun) with his choice of girlfriend, when he has to forever fend off every mortal and monster out to get her.A modernized myth ensconced in a forbidden love story, director Catherine Hardwicke had a similarly against-all-odds task of pleasing audiences, most of which are hard-core fans of the book. Since much of Twilight's power is said to come from Bella's thoughts, this can of course only be visually executed in a limited fashion. The protagonists' feelings are also very reliant on the intense looks and expressions exchanged multiple times, and the actors successfully transmit their frustrations to the audience, despite the widely-held opinion of getting a cast that fit better. Can't please them all! And so, equally moody music like Debussy's Claire de Lune and other more modern angst-ridden faves '15 Step' by Radiohead and 'Supermassive Black Hole' by Muse is interspersed throughout to sustain the teen drama, but could not distract the audience enough to feel the full (over two hours) length of this movie. Not only was it overlong, it was painfully cheesy at several points, but for female teens to fawn over Twilight would be understandable.",6,3,7,9 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," intense, raw, painful and brutally honest
","Frank: I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! April: It takes backbone to lead the life you want!Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) works for the first time with his wife Kate Winslet in Revolutionary Road, a heavy drama based on Richard Yates' novel. It also reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Winslet since 1997's Titanic.Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) seem to live the perfect life with their two kids in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Frank has a job he doesn't like but is good at, while April put her acting dreams on hold to become a full-time housewife. But they feel trapped and unhappy and feel like there is a better life than what they have. Then April hatches the perfect plan: the Wheelers will start over in Paris, the only place she remembers her husband saying was worth returning to, where people felt most alive. No job awaits Frank there, in fact, he has no idea what he will do, but he will finally have the time to find out. April volunteers to support the family by applying for a good-paying secretarial job. They announce their plan to the world, but when they begin execution, complications ensue, values are tested, and the couple discovers so much more about each other that will forever change their future. Revolutionary Road is intense, raw, painful and brutally honest. It has been called a humorless American Beauty, but it's so much more. It may be set in the '50s, but its message continues to speak to anyone in a relationship today. Technically, while the performances were terrific, it sometimes felt like the characters were mouthpieces on a tableau, as if in a play. But that itch aside, Revolutionary Road resonated with me, being in a relationship and having had the same thoughts as the characters. When April says, 'I saw a whole other future. I can't stop seeing it,' you feel her desire and grief. You will also feel Frank's helplessness even in his volatile explosions. Even in their many conversations and yelling sprees, one might think that at least the couple communicates and are honest with each other. But in the end, there is a scene that at first confused me, but later on I realized its importance: how a couple lasts by showing how the other copes. It was a simple but powerful scene, perhaps depressing but real nonetheless.",9,1,1,2 March 2009
Bolt," A good day guaranteed!
","Ridonculous! Bolt has the audience in the pad of his paw from beginning to end.A white American shepherd who plays a hit TV series' superdog hero, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) leads a Truman Show life: he thinks his superpowers are real and believes that his sci-fi adventures with his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) are serious. When Bolt accidentally strays from the confines of his studio lot world, he embarks on a real-life quest to find his person and protect her from the evil Dr. Calico. He gets into true-to-life troubles himself, encountering genuine characters along the way: a trio of pigeons, Mittens the alley cat (Susie Essman) and fan-hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). Ally McBeal's Greg Germann provides the voice for Penny's scheming Agent, while The Drew Carey Show's Diedrich Bader is the voice for the Veteran Cat.It may be executive-produced by Pixar's John Lasseter and has tinges of his comedy stylings, but Bolt is fully a Disney creation. Having Lasseter on board ensures that the adults in the audience will probably have an even better time than the kids. The animation is impressive, as it delivers the drama and emotion, as well as the laughs and the Fully Awesome action! It would just be really difficult not to smile and swoon at Bolt and his sidekicks. Watch it and have a good day guaranteed!",9,8,11,7 December 2008
The Number 23," The effort is starkly laid out but the sincerity is lacking...
","Just when we thought Jim Carrey was either taking an extended sabbatical or floundering, he reinvents himself again. He can't command his old US$20M paycheck by playing his usual characters, so taking a pay cut, he's freed himself to pursue other acting exploits.As if to offer a smooth transition for the audience, The Number 23 starts out funny. It establishes a likable Walter Sparrow (Carrey), a loving husband/father/dogcatcher. He later becomes obsessed with a book relayed by a detective, Fingerling, who is uncannily too similar to him. Somehow, murder seems to be in the mix. Virginia Madsen plays his supportive baker wife Agatha.Director Joel Schumacher fearlessly takes the plunge along with Carrey's reinvention with The Number 23. His intentions are very clear; his aim is to entertain, and that's what this film feels like, a trippy ride. While Schumacher develops his characters well, somehow the audience is not able to either suspend disbelief or relate emotionally with the characters.Carrey displays his leading man side with the buff body, the sexy tattoos and the slicked back hair, but sadly, he still isn't able to translate into someone lust-worthy; you keep expecting him to distort his face into some gag. He just couldn't match Madsen, who plays the dowdy wife well, but just as delightfully goes back to her vixen roots by transforming into Fabrizia, the Italian temptress in Fingerling's story. The choice of 'Tear You Apart' by She Wants Revenge played in the background during their seduction scene was very much inspired and added to the excitement.The effort is starkly laid out but the sincerity is lacking; for some reason, you feel manipulated but you don't mind, because you don't care. The Number 23 feels longer than its 95 minutes, but watch it anyway for its interesting premise and entertainment value.",7,9,23,21 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Unbelievably handsome Matt Long plays the young Johnny Blaze, who unfortunately grows up to look like Nicolas Cage
","Another Marvel comic book story reincarnated on the silver screen, Ghost Rider is a story of redemption, good vs. evil and the other complexities common in this genre's lore.Johnny Blaze, a young motorcycle stunt driver does carnival acts together with his dad, whom he tries to save from certain death by accidentally entering a pact with the devil. He grows up doing increasingly more dangerous stunts while trying to redeem his ghastly self and protect the woman he loves.The unbelievably handsome Matt Long plays the young Johnny Blaze, who unfortunately grows up to look like Nicolas Cage with hair plugs and seemingly fake abs (which Cage has reportedly defended as real and not CGI as suspected). At least the beautiful Raquel Alessi, who plays Johnny Blaze's love interest Roxanne Simpson, grows up to be the equally luscious Eva Mendes. Peter Fonda plays the devil Mephistopheles, and Wes Bentley (from American Beauty) plays his son, Blackheart, who calls on the other forces of evil to help wrest from the Ghost Rider a prized contract.CGI-effects were heavily used, which is why the movie was about a year late in its release, so I might as well comment on it. When Blackheart transforms into his evil face, he laughably looks like one of those ghosts in Asian horror flicks like The Grudge or The Ring. Blackheart's minions were also not worthy adversaries, very easily defeated by Ghost Rider in the incredible situations, which is perhaps why the children in the theater were not scared.Ghost Rider is fun stuff, nothing so amazing but it is definitely entertaining.",6,0,2,25 February 2007
Across the Universe," Anyone who's ever had a Beatles phase will definitely enjoy the mostly brilliant covers...
","I wasn't too keen to see this because of the lackluster reviews but I'm glad I did anyway. Anyone who's ever had a Beatles phase will definitely enjoy the mostly brilliant covers of the Beatles' classics that this movie's script is based on. Even if this was set in the turbulent 60s, it is still based on real events, and the meshing of Beatles' songs did not seem forced into the story. There were some cringe-worthy sappy moments that come with most musicals, and overlong psychedelic sequences, but overall, the performances from every one in the talented cast were enjoyable. Evan Rachel Wood was perfect as Lucy, a fresh-faced, sheltered teener from the suburbs, who attracts her polar opposite in Jude (played by Jim Sturgess), a scruffy sailor who jumps ship from Liverpool to the US in search of his father. They live a bohemian life in New York in the company of their flower power friends, amid the radical activism prevalent at the time.Memorable renditions of Beatles songs featured in Across the Universe include: 'Helter Skelter' performed by Dana Fuchs (who plays singer Sadie), 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' performed by T. V. Carpio (who plays cheerleader/lesbian Prudence), and the best sequences were 'With a Little Help from My Friends' performed by Joe Anderson and Jim Sturgess, which was incredibly choreographed, and so was 'Come Together' performed by Joe Cocker and Martin Luther (who plays Sadie's guitarist and lover, JoJo), 'Something' performed by Jim Sturgess while he was drawing a sleeping, naked Lucy, and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' performed by Martin Luther and Jim Sturgess. Cameos from Bono and Salma Hayek perk up the already trippy and visually stimulating movie.",8,1,3,20 February 2008
Stardust," the trailer didn't do it justice
","A welcome surprise! Despite the lackluster trailer and casting the unstellar-looking Claire Danes as Yvaine the Star , the movie came out as a well executed, entertaining adaptation of Neil Gaiman's book Stardust.It's wonderful how director/writer/producer Matthew Vaughn was able to sensitively add all the elements of fun, action, romance and suspense and still give the movie a GP rating. Of course, it lost the gore of the book but it's still a fantastic tale as well.It was well-written and well-cast except for Danes, who should've traded places w/ Sienna Miller instead. Charlie Cox, looking like a young Robert Sean Leonard, was endearing, while Robert de Niro and Ricky Gervais provided a lot of the laughs. Michelle Pfeiffer was indeed terrifying as an evil witch; it's unnerving how she can now allow herself to be portrayed that way.The pacing of the story was just right, the effects were not over the top, truly entertaining stuff!",9,4,5,13 October 2007
I Am Legend," I Am Legend is a rare treat, so enjoy it!!!
","Will Smith does not disappoint as the last man on earth, Robert Neville, in the incredible third film adaptation of the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend.Smith sticks to his winning formula of choosing blockbusters that hinge on impressive special effects, which serve as the perfect backdrop to his always well-received performances. Smith has a rare quality of being so likable he can sustain audience interest even when he is alone for most of the movie (the gratuitous shot of him doing chin-ups is a nice bonus). His earnest delivery of both thrills and laughs makes him v. special.This commitment is shared by his very able co-star Abby, who simply must win best supporting actress. She plays Sam, Neville's German Shepherd and companion. Her eyes are very expressive for a non-mutt (purebreds' faces usually fail to have character), and she holds her own against a star like Smith (haha).The part where Neville loses Sam in a darkened building had a Blair Witch-feel, and you can't help but be as paranoid and always on the look out as Neville each time something out of the ordinary happens. Lots of other interesting details also appear in the eerie city that are worth pointing out as you vicariously accompany Neville in the lonely, future Manhattan .I Am Legend is a rare treat, so enjoy it; you will surely get emotionally tangled with the highs and lows of this action-suspense-sci-fi thriller.",9,3,6,12 January 2008
Gran Torino," irreverently funny!
","Surprisingly enjoyable! The poster seems serious and poised its viewers for heavy drama, but Gran Torino is irreverently funny. It's great seeing Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby) create movies for himself using material that would otherwise never see Hollywood. Not only has he continued to successfully direct emotionally-charged dramas but he also shows aging actors how to create roles for themselves.Set in the not-so-sleepy suburban Midwest, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a grumpy widower and Korean War vet who ends up befriending his Hmong teenage neighbor, Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), who tried to steal his vintage car, a 1972 Gran Torino. The old dog is also forced to accept new ways when he has to deal with the growing number of minorities in his neighborhood, while struggling against his well-meaning son who tries to take care of him with embarrassing results.The rest of the supporting cast is laudable and turn in earnest performances, including Christopher Carley as the young Father Janovich, who relentlessly tries to befriend Kowalski, and Ahney Her as Thao's sassy sister, Sue. Eastwood triumphs once more in turning what would otherwise be a simple drama into a memorable, engaging story, using his heroic anti-hero Kowalski as a platform for better written roles for older actors. Don't miss this one!",9,2,7,21 February 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," with its GP appeal, expect it to deliver good, clean fun and passable entertainment
","This was better than the first of the series, but still campy. While the title highlights the Silver Surfer, the plot in fact still revolves around the two-dimensional issues of the Fantastic Four. As Dr. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic, played by Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman, played by Jessica Alba) try to get married in the midst of the hoopla as superhero celebs, the team discovers that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they come up against the mysterious Silver Surfer and the Earth-threatening Galactus. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/Torch is the only one who lights up the screen with his sizzling screen presence (pardon the pun), and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/Thing is his reliable foil.Julian McMahon (of Nip/Tuck and Charmed fame) reprises his role as the evil Victor Von Doom; it's a pity he did not get more screen time. I have not read the comicbooks, but F4 was different in that unlike other superhero stories, the foursome are open celebrities and lead no secret lives. Yet, they unrealistically squabble about their issues as if they are not used to being on call to save the world at a moment's notice (hello, that's what superheroes do!). Also unlike other such stories, the military/police are not grateful for the Fantastic Four's help and do not seem to collaborate with them, treating the superheroes as brats they have to deal with.Nonetheless, with its general patronage appeal, expect the movie to deliver good, clean fun and passable entertainment.",7,35,72,11 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," entertains while being surprisingly relevant and unshallow
","'Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments' is the exacting tagline of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and while the fantastic story of a man that ages backwards (the titular character played by Brad Pitt) is hard to swallow, it entertains while being surprisingly relevant and unshallow.The versatile David Fincher, who also directed Pitt in Fight Club and Se7en, made Benjamin Button as lengthy as his other fab film Zodiac, but he keeps you occupied with the sumptuous visual design and smoothly executed special effects that don't steal the characters' thunder. After all, it's the cast that not only assured box-office draw but also made sure that you are emotionally engaged.It's difficult not to feel for each one of them. As his life is played all throughout, you will share in Benjamin's curiosity and innocence. You will feel the frustration, heartbreak and devotion of his lifelong love Daisy (played by the marvelously chameleonic Cate Blanchett). Julia Ormond's thespic skills didn't seem necessary though as Daisy's daughter Caroline, but Taraji P. Henson deserves a best supporting actress nod for her moving portrayal as Queenie. Also praiseworthy is Tilda Swinton's short but impactful performance as Benjamin's first lover Elizabeth.You will watch it for the commercial appeal but you will come out of the theater hopefully more aware and grateful for each moment you have with your loved ones. At least that's what you should take home with you.",9,0,1,6 January 2009
Transformers," Incredible! Amazing! Super!
","Incredible! Amazing! Super! These are the superlatives that immediately come to mind to describe this crowd pleaser.Admittedly, I shared many a Transformers fan's apprehension at having Michael Bay (Armaggedon, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, Bad Boys) direct the film. I'm not particularly a fan of his let's-blow-everything-up style, and most other fans thought he's too old (at 42) to relay their sacred bots' story on the big screen. But despite his cockiness, I'm happy to report that he delivered the goods--and how! Mighty wise of him holding back on the previews, which did not share much of the storyline or even a view of a whole robot; this heightened the anticipation and enhanced the effect of seeing the robots transform seamlessly in all its intricately mixed CGI glory, which really blew the audience away.The action was non-stop and all original (check out the rollerblading 'bot in one of the many intense car chases--a Bay specialty). The Decepticons were really sleek and scary and looked so much tougher than the colorful, dated-looking Autobots, but of course we always root for the underdog. The filmmakers' were also able to successfully translate emotions to the gigantic robots without making them look cutesy and without sacrificing their 'roots'.Bay really made the most out of the plot, and considering Transformers' target audience (reminiscing Gen X 30somethings, mostly male), the result is an exciting ride which was also pleasantly funny in parts. Never mind if there were endless plugs on My Little Pony, Furby, Nokia, etc. They only served to honor one of the movie's messages: that old-school is still cool (and that knowing some ancient tactics can definitely help you in a pinch!).It helped that latest Hollywood hot property Shia LaBeouf (Disturbia, Indiana Jones 4) was likable and had good comic timing, and the staple Bay hottie was played to the hilt by the beautiful Megan Fox. Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) releases his reliance on his looks to play the leader of the Special Ops team who first gets attacked by the Decepticons.Autobot leader Optimus Prime has been called one of our generation's strongest father figures, and his fate in this movie will definitely please his fans. You might be surprised to see him with lips in this version, although it is said that in the later Japanese animations, he already had them.Finally, a summer blockbuster for the year that isn't a sequel and doesn't disappoint! A sequel is sure to be in the works, featuring the other Transformers who weren't featured in this installment. Yet another flick to anticipate!",9,1,6,28 June 2007
World Trade Center," For a Stone movie, this was politically lightweight.
","For a Stone movie, this was politically lightweight. It focused not on the forest but on the trees; specifically, a select sampling of the lives of those directly affected by the crash. It is an unabashed display of what it is to be human: how you can choose to give up or keep on fighting.I have a confession to make: I didn't care about 9/11 the way the world did when it happened five years ago; I was too busy tending to my own personal 9/11 and was pretty much numb to everything else around me. World Trade Center isn't the sort of movie I would actively like to see; I'd rather see something lighter or more entertaining, but it has been a while since my own personal hell, so I decided it was time to care and start feeling again.Seeing the grief, uncertainty and helplessness painfully unraveled on screen was therapeutic; some things happen beyond your control, no matter how well intentioned you may be. Some things you think would last forever, like the formidable looking Twin Towers, could crumble in an instant after all. When you think you have a big problem, the person next to you could be experiencing something much worse, and your pain pales in comparison.Michael Peña's character Will quotes from, of all movies, G.I. Jane, 'Pain is good; it means that you are alive.' At the time, his Sgt. John (Nicolas Cage), who was crushed by debris worse than he was, could barely chuckle at this, but he had to be strong for his underling; their lives depended on it.The movie works because it makes you FEEL. I'm glad that I finally got to soak it all in. After all, pain is something anyone can relate to; yes, even those that cause it will feel it some time, too.",7,2,5,4 November 2006
The Dark Knight," Perfect everything!
","Insert all superlatives here and they would still be lacking; The Dark Knight (TDK) just blew me away! I daresay it's a perfect film.Director/writer/producer Christopher Nolan has done the seemingly impossible with TDK by topping his own other piece of almost-perfection, Batman Begins (Katie Holmes just did not belong there). Nolan has proved that he can do no wrong, elevating what could easily have been just another empty superhero cash cow into a veritably deep, multi-layered piece of film-making brilliance. He has the natural gift of translating not only complex situations but also complicated thoughts and emotions fluidly on screen.Christian Bale continues to leave audiences in thrall as he shuttles effortlessly from the charmingly carefree Bruce Wayne to the brave but tormented Batman. Never has a super anti-hero been this insanely hot! But everyone will of course be talking about the real scene-stealer: Heath Ledger. It would be unfair to say that the hype comes with his untimely death, because his rendition of one of the most terrifying villains in cinema as the Joker was truly impressive. He successfully added depth and humor in a role where the obvious route could have been a bad case of overacting, but he made the Joker a truly frightening but strangely likable psychopath. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Maggie Gylenhaal as Rachel Dawes were surprising but wise choices; both are terrific actors, actually everyone in this film was, down to the extras.If I had to nitpick? I'd have wanted a killer soundtrack to go with it, but I suppose that would've destroyed its stick-to-good-old-film-making basics. Despite its length (but I wouldn't have it any shorter), TDK delivered more than its hype, and that is its biggest success. Everyone involved in this film deserves all the credit due to it; it's just spectacular!",10,4,9,19 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," to appreciate both mediums you must understand the limitations and advantages of both film and literature
","I've read all 6 Potter books and all 5 Potter films so far and to appreciate both mediums you must understand the limitations and advantages of both film and literature. Not everyone can be expected to do this, so there will always be misinformed displeasure for one or the other form.With the premise that the first Harry Potter book started when he was 11 years old and of course gets older each year, expect the teenage angst to escalate each time, hence, the darker tone by the time he hits 16 in Order of the Phoenix. Since most of this story's elements occur in the characters' minds, with heavy focus on the characters' feelings, it was definitely a challenge to execute visually on film. For instance, showing someone deep in thought while having a narration in the background simply can't be compared to reading about it if it's meant to be read.Having said that, I admire the attempt to bring the book to life on screen: the visuals and characterizations are just as you would imagine, having read the book. I'm not a big fantasy buff either, but I enjoy reading the Potter books because I like the escapism, and I can relate with the characters at those ages, and I suppose the characters have grown on me, too; I like to know what happens to them next.For all the flak people have said about Harry Potter, they can't take away the fact that it's gotten people reading again, especially children who can be so easily distracted these days to do something else requiring less imagination. Adults who read the series have also had their share of snickers thrown their way for reading children's lit, but that's where the Potter series succeeds: it revels in being different and makes the odd feel at home. Now who can't ever relate to that?To appreciate Order of the Phoenix, the frequent flashbacks offered in the movie might not be enough so you might need to brush up on the previous books. If you follow the books, you'd like the introduction of the new characters like Kreacher here, who will also appear in the 6th installment, the Half-Blood Prince, where more of Voldemort and Harry's past are threshed out further. Expect an even darker mood and flashbacks galore.",8,0,1,15 July 2007
Blood Diamond," DiCaprio sustains 'irresistibly vulnerable' antihero appeal...
","After 'The Departed', Leonardo DiCaprio once more proves he is all grown up with Blood Diamond. He is terrific in this film with an amazing South African accent, and a credible troubled past and tough guy front. He excels at being the irresistibly vulnerable antihero you can't help but root for.Jennifer Connelly was also perfectly cast and believable as investigative journalist Maddy, and she and DiCaprio acted superbly; too bad they lacked chemistry. The heat between them just wasn't enough to graduate into a sizzle.Directed by Edward Zwick (Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Glory, Last Samurai), this pseudo-documentary about the conflict diamond trade in Africa effectively preaches its message while entertaining the audience. However, Zwick lays on the drama too thickly, milking each scene too often, with some sequences running on too long (sobrang babad). After a while, I thought I was watching LOTR or an episode of Lost. While this is a great way to educate people about a cause, nothing new was really given from a film-making perspective. The story unravels in disappointingly safe Hollywood formulaic fashion, a pity when there was so much material, talent and background to exploit further. Still, Zwick manages to arouse enough emotion from audiences enough to make them part with their money for admission, and in that respect, this film is a success.",8,3,4,13 January 2007
Taken," Sure to be any father's required film viewing for their daughters!
","Sure to be any father's required film viewing for their daughters! I thought of mine the whole time I was watching this flick and I begrudgingly became extra aware of parents' POV when they have to let go of their kids. It really can be a bad, crazy world out there, and after watching Taken, you'd want to have a dad like Liam Neeson's character, Bryan Mills.Bryan retired from the CIA to get closer to his beloved daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who has just turned 17. Kim lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), and asks permission from him to go to Paris with a friend. He reluctantly allows her, and his worst fears come to life when she is kidnapped by an Armenian white slavery ring. Bryan is forced to use his special set of skills to get his daughter back, armed with only very few clues, in only a few hours he has before she disappears forever.Written by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Transporter series), Taken is the impressive Hollywood directorial debut of cinematographer Pierre Morel. He has loads of help from Neeson, though, who is super believable transitioning from ultra-doting dad to unstoppable force to reckon with. If you're ever in trouble, you'd want to have him on your side. When he says he's coming to get you, you know he will, especially when he quickly and efficiently handles anyone who gets in his way. I would definitely like to see him taking on more roles like this one. It was just as startling to see the beautiful Janssen in a subdued mother role, having been used to seeing her as the femme fatale or the superhero for the better part of her career. While definitely pretty, Grace was miscast as Kim. Not only is she a decade older than the character, she's already famous as whiny Shannon in Lost. While still whiny, her acting was too affected, perhaps trying to compensate for playing someone much younger. She ran like a retard and her misplaced mannerisms distracted from the movie.Still, I found Taken to be v. entertaining; needless to say, don't take it so seriously! It delivers on being violent, ridiculous, unbelievable fun so enjoy it!",8,6,10,1 February 2009
Avatar," Technically a success, but the villains suck
","To say that Avatar is incredible is an understatement. Writer/director James Cameron's first directorial feature film since his Oscar-winning directorial effort in 1997's Titanic proved that he can still churn out critically-acclaimed box office hits.With an estimated budget of US$280M, Avatar is one of the most expensive movies ever produced, and is the first film ever to earn over US$2B worldwide, making it the highest grossing film ever.Relative unknown Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation) is cast as Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine sent to the moon Pandora on a mission to infiltrate the enemy by assuming an alien body with the help of scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, who is reunited with her Aliens director). An accident facilitates Jake's acceptance into the alien community, but carrying out his mission becomes complicated when he falls for the alien Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana (Star Trek), and the world he now sees with new eyes and he has to ultimately choose which reality he wants to save.Since technically everything else is excellent, I have to gripe about the villains. Giovanni Ribisi (Public Enemies, Lost in Translation) plays Parker Selfridge, a sadly one-dimensional character bent on profits, while Stephen Lang plays Colonel Miles Quaritch, the stereotypical military man who impatiently muscles his way into anything. Both have no depth, no saving grace and become convenient objects of hate. Even Michelle Rodriguez typecasts herself once more by playing yet another tough girl role, macho helicopter pilot Trudy Chacon.But that aside, the digs on the Bush administration's shock-and-awe tactics and the parallelism on the very current environmental degradation makes this cinematic experience easily digestible even when it takes its sweet time to entertain you, especially in 3D.",8,0,3,11 February 2010
Invictus," Deserves a second glance
","Two-time Oscar Best Director winner Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven) adapts for the screen John Carlin's book 'Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation' with 'Invictus'.In another Oscar nominated role as Nelson Mandela, Oscar Best Supporting Actor winner Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) portrays the South African President who, in his first term, starts a curious campaign to unify the country torn apart by racism by supporting the mostly white national rugby team to win the 1995 World Cup. Oscar Best Screenplay winner Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) is also nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as rugby team captain Francois Pienaar, who becomes Mandela's unlikely partner.Eastwood tells this story like he's told his other movie gems: deliberately, bordering on overlong. He takes his time to explore each character and he often appeals to great emotion. Mandela is presented as 'a man, not a saint', touching painfully on his separation from his wife and estrangement from his daughter.It's difficult not to like an underdog plot for a film, especially as a Filipino moviegoer such as myself who immediately latches on to parallelisms with South Africa's poverty and need for a strong leader, how rugby has served as an inspiring metaphor for unity just like our own boxing champ Manny Pacquiao has decreased crime rates whenever a match of his is on. 'Invictus' isn't something the average escapist moviegoer will camp out to see; frankly, it sounds boring. After all, the title is of a poem most highschoolers have had to memorize and so may regard this as a 'required viewing' sort of flick. But whether or not you still remember the lines to the poem that aptly inspired Mandela's 'unconquerable soul', revisit it in context with a glimpse of the actual cell where Mandela stayed for almost 30 years and marvel how despite that experience, he is able to forgive his oppressors, something that is crucial to his goal of unity for his country. (If that still doesn't grab you, at least watch out for Eastwood's son Scott, who delivers the final kicks for the Springboks in their game against New Zealand.)",8,1,1,21 February 2010
The Happening," Just roll with it
","To make the most out of The Happening, lose all expectations and watch it with easily spooked friends for maximum enjoyment.M. Night Shyamalan's latest effort has him going back to basics, seemingly inspired by Hitchcockian produce. With the clunky dialogue and strange acting by Zooey Deschanel, however, even the ever reliable Mark Wahlberg and the sadly short screen time of John Leguizamo couldn't make audiences take this seriously as a remotely intelligent thriller.The Happening gives a flavor of being unintentionally funny though, so once you decide to just roll with it, then you will enjoy the build-up to the freaky climaxes and just laugh yourself silly.At least it wasn't as bad as Lady in the Water.",6,1,6,21 June 2008
The Fountain," Not even earnest acting by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz could save this film
","Horrible and pretentious. Not even earnest acting by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz could save this film by Weisz's fiancé, writer/director Darren Aronofsky. Some woman in the cinema was snoring loudly and none of us bothered to shush her because it was understandably a snoozefest.The main plot line is simple: Tom (Jackman) is a doctor married to Izzi (Weisz), a dying writer. Tom furiously tries to find a cure for her disease. He says, 'Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it.'Then the story finds parallels with the story Izzi is writing in her book (in longhand, using old school pen and ink, for crying out loud, with no erasures!), where Tom and Izzi also play the characters. It also has a third subplot (?) where Tom is a bald, tattooed Zen-like monk-like man trapped in a snow globe. Lots of New Age mumbo jumbo, which was supposed to be visually poetic, tons of closeups of something that looked like yellow amber, and stylized cinematography. The Fountain has terribly redundant and cheesy writing, too:Izzi: Will you deliver Spain from bondage? Tom Verde: Upon my honor and my life. Izzi: Then you shall take this ring to remind you of your promise. You shall wear it when you find Eden, and when you return, I shall be your Eve. Together we will live forever.Even hot, talented men like Jackman make mistakes. Imagine agreeing to shaving his head and chest for the worst sequence ever with an object (a tree). Tom Hanks and 'Wilson' in Cast Away did so much better. That was 96 mins. of my life I will never get back. Don't make the same mistake I made. Watch something else.",1,4,12,19 February 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," not as fun as Jack Black's other films but definitely better than Nacho Libre...
","This was a 'steady' flicknot as fun as Jack Black's other films but definitely better than Nacho Libre. Personally, this musical comedy is so much easier to digest than other operatic Broadway drivel, especially if you are a fan of Tenacious D (their song 'Wonderboy' is a real hoot!).Black and Kyle Gass make up the band that is Tenacious D. Listen to their song 'Tribute' to better appreciate the movie (the video's hilarious, too!). The movie is a spin-off of the song, which tells the story of how Tenacious D was formed to become the world's greatest band by defeating Satan himself (played by the Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl). Watch out for other cameos by Ben Stiller (also the executive producer), John C. Reilly and many more.The plot is thin and ridiculous but you continue to watch it anyway just because it can be irreverently fun (living out the essence of rock). Also, because rooting for the underdogs that Black and Gass areold, balding, tubby rockstar-wannabesis such a classic crowd-pleasing formula. Watch it if you like rock, don't take things so seriously, and just want to zone out for some self-indulgent me-time. :o)",7,3,6,19 January 2007
The Departed," This movie should finally get them both their ever elusive Oscars
","Finally, a movie with a great cast, great director and great script that lives up to all the hype! This remake of the Hong Kong gangster flick series Infernal Affairs was beautifully executed by Martin Scorsese, along with his muse-of-the-moment Leonardo Di Caprio. This movie should finally get them both their ever elusive Oscars; Di Caprio and Scorsese have been nominated several times but neither ever won.Mark Wahlberg, who plays Martin Sheen's partner, adds comic relief with his bulldog character Dignam. Jack Nicholson chillingly plays the villainous Frank Costello perfectly, and yet he manages to get the audience to laugh with him and be enamored by his evil. Nicholson was the only one who didn't take a chance on a character change (having played a similar role in Witches of Eastwick and other flicks). Matt Damon successfully pulls off his first turn as a villain, and Di Caprio develops the physical features to truthfully play a mature role. Di Caprio has consistently been a good actor, but even in The Aviator, his baby-faced features just couldn't dissolve well into the character, no matter how intensely he emotes. In The Departed, he finally looks gritty enough, and, as clinical psychiatrist Madolyn (played by newcomer Vera Farmiga) very correctly puts it, irresistibly vulnerable.The movie is almost three hours long but you don't feel it; it is tightly edited and composed, which isn't very Scorsese. Definitely one of the best movies of the year.",9,1,2,11 November 2006
The Holiday," Have a cup of steaming hot chocolate with you, for the full effect.
","Writer/director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, Something's Gotta Give) obviously knows how to make movies for her female target audience. The trailer pretty much explains the plot: Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet) swap homes over the holidays to get over their heartbreaks and end up in complicated situations, involving men of course, in their adopted getaways.Amanda has the amazing bod, wardrobe, dream home plus a fantastic job as a movie trailer maker, but suffers from a cheating boyfriend (Ed Burns). She meets Graham (Jude Law), a fiercely attractive and mysterious book editor. It's refreshing to see Law play a sensitive non-cad, for once; he is still incredibly charming. Sweet and thoughtful Iris works in publishing as well, but her kindness is abused by her ever ineligible ex (Rufus Sewell). She meets Miles (the always-fun Jack Black), who is also in the creative business, doing musical scores for films.The characters are all flawed, highly relatable and likable. Even the supporting cast and cameos are all welcome additions and don't appear as afterthoughts. The scenarios, despite the obvious tragedies, make you very willing to escape to this world for 2.5 hours, inordinately long for this genre.Ladies, watch this wonderful chick-flick with your closest amigas; men, see it for educational purposes. Anti-romcom (romantic comedy)? Go see it anyway for the pretty good soundtrack furnished by Imogen Heap, The Killers and Jet.

Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," could use some clever cutting
","Michael Cera reprises a role he does best (a good-natured dork) as high school student Nick O'Leary, the only straight guy in the mostly gay-punk group The Jerk Offs. Nick makes 'closure' CD soundtracks (up to Vol. 12!) for his bitchy ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena, another stereotype for most annoying girl ever--originally hated her in Fool's Gold). Nick meets Tris' best friend Norah Silverberg (Kat Dennings), a mysterious, brooding type, when she asks him to play her boyfriend for a few minutes (another old trick in the book).Just like the characters' purported awkward age, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist was painfully awkward in its acting, story and editing. There were a few highlights and seriously funny moments, but they are a sad sprinkling. Ari Graynor's antics as Caroline, Norah's drunk and ditzy friend, seemed genuine but it wasn't established how and why they remain friends. Some of the dialogue is hilarious but you are rewarded by these handouts only if you're patient enough not to sleep through this infinitely long-drawn out teen flick.Oh, the soundtrack was perfectly ambient but not particularly memorable (which is the saddest part!), however, I thought the escalator kissing scene was really sweet.",6,5,5,18 February 2009
The Last King of Scotland," Be awakened by the brutality not only of actual blood spilled but also more horrifyingly, of quiet decisions we and our leaders make everyday
","Based on the novel by Giles Foden, The Last King of Scotland is inspired by true events from the brutal regime of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin as told by his personal physician in the early 70s.Scottish director Kevin Macdonald directs fellow Scot, James McAvoy, as the fictitious Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, who sees Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) as both charismatic and terrifyingly gruesome. While McAvoy is able to hold his own, acting-wise, against the fierce Amin portrayed by the Oscar-deserving Whitaker, he suffers from his youth; he looks like he belongs in high school and not believably a young doctor interested to help the plight of the African poor.Gillian Anderson (more popularly known from The X-Files) has an understated role as Sarah Merrit, wife of the small town doctor whom Nicholas originally came to help. Her character pegs him from the beginning as not the sort anyone would think would come to Uganda to help in their mission. He proves her right later on.While the audience could probably understand Nicholas' restless need for adventure, it is difficult to relate with this antihero, especially as someone who is telling the story. The average person would probably not have done the things he did.However, the painful truth surfaces when another doctor Djonjo tells Nicholas, 'Go home and tell the truth about Amin. They will believe you. You are a white man.' The editing is crisp and the unraveling of the story is exciting. Filipinos can perhaps relate to the political atmosphere of that time. Watch this and be awakened by the brutality not only of actual blood spilled but also more horrifyingly, of quiet decisions we and our leaders make everyday.",9,3,4,25 February 2007
American Gangster," A cross between The Godfather and The Departed...
","A cross between The Godfather and The Departed, American Gangster is set in the East Coast in the '70s and based on the true story of how Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) brought down the low-profile heroin kingpin from Harlem Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). While both men lay on opposite sides of the law and are notoriously flawed, they uncannily share a rigorous work ethic, enabling them to later conspire against something bigger than themselves.The opening scene immediately establishes Lucas as a cool and collected gentleman from North Carolina who can get scary when angry. Meanwhile, Roberts is a scruffy but honest cop who is battling with his hostile wife for child custody while he goes to law school.Both Oscar winners turn in award-worthy performances once more, but it is Crowe who most consistently and easily transforms into his character. He is an imperfect hero who buys dishonesty with honesty. His dedication despite his shortcomings makes the viewer relate to and root for him, even when Lucas tempts him: 'Would you do it again, return US$1M in unmarked bills?' American Gangster gives hope that police corruption and widespread drug trafficking can be stopped even by the sometimes morally deficient. The message comes across clear with director Ridley Scott's compelling visuals, with crisp contrasts in montages reminiscent of The Godfather. Such deft cinematography could sometimes eclipse the dialogue, which contributes its fair share of memorable quotes.A parallelism with the Italian mafia's affinity for family is evident when Lucas tells his siblings, 'The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work... family... never forgetting where we came from,' and again when Lucas scolds his brother Huey for wearing an attention-getting suit, 'The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room!' Lucas' drive to deliver his product at all costs threatens his downfall, when he refuses to heed his Thai drug supplier's strangely wise advice: 'It's not in my best interest to say this Frank, but quitting while you're ahead, is not the same as quitting.' This biopic doesn't bombard the audience with gore it could easily get away with but instead it allows for thought-provoking moments, such as one launched by Lucas: will putting the bad guy behind bars really change anything? Roberts' gritty retort: 'You represent progress, that's why they hate you. Success has enemies; be unsuccessful and have friends.'",8,1,4,7 January 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Effortless perfection!
","Effortless perfection! Director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland, Stay, Monster's Ball) deftly manipulates his audiences' feelings in the wonderful dramedy Stranger than Fiction. Precisely hitting all the notes in making an ensemble cast work, everything just seemed so carefully thought out without feeling contrivedthere is simply nothing to dislike about this film.Will Ferrell very successfully transitions from his usual screwball comedic acts to sincere, sensitive and likable everyday IRS agent Harold Crick, who falls in love with his auditee, government-hater and bohemian baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who just marvelously disappeared into the role). Dustin Hoffman flawlessly plays literary expert Professor Jules Hilbert, whom Crick runs to for help to find out how to stop his life from ending as intimated to him by the voice in his head, while Queen Latifah was able to stand on her own as assistant Penny to Emma Thompson's eccentric tragic novelist Kay Eiffel, who is struggling with writer's block, trying to find out the best way to kill her lead character Crick.Forster makes everything so easy to love: his recurring themes of contrast and interconnectivity blend smoothly with the refreshingly original story, the immensely talented actors that quietly dissolve into their characters (usually very difficult to suspend disbelief with a stellar cast), thoughtful set design (all calm neutrals in modernist designs) and a breathtaking indie-rock soundtrack (said to be this year's answer to Garden State's OST). Here are a few of the incredibly killer lines:Penny Escher: (looks at a pile of smoked cigarettes on Kay's desk) Did you smoke all of these? Kay Eiffel: No, they came pre-smoked.Ana Pascal: Did you like the cookies? Harold Crick: Yes. Thank you for forcing me to eat them.Harold Crick: (talking to Ana while holding a cardboard box with multiple small paper bags inside) I brought you flours.<---isn't this absolutely the sweetest??Kay Eiffel: (narrating) And so he did what countless punk-rock songs had told him to do so many times before: he lived his life.The line that saved the movie from triteness is a spoiler, so you will have to see the movie for yourself, on the big screen. Stranger than Fiction is multidimensional; it's not just a clever movie, it makes you think about how you choose to live your life, every minute of every day.",10,6,11,19 January 2007
The Reader," What would you have done?
","Based on the 1995 novel by Bernhard Schlink, The Reader (Der Vorleser) tackles difficult ethical standpoints in post-WWII Germany.Fifteen-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) has a passionate summer affair with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a mysterious woman twice his age. She suddenly disappears but accidentally resurfaces in his life eight years later as a defendant in a trial he is observing as a law student. It culminates in a decision to either keep or divulge a secret important to Hanna that Michael knows could absolve her but damn him and the cause of those inadvertently affected by her unfortunate actions.Oscar nominated director Stephen Daldry (for Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader) shows his trademark restraint and skillful handling of top-notch actors in this heavy drama about human complexity. The story itself is so open to interpretation and could've been coarsely treated but Daldry and his remarkable cast show immense sensitivity that it becomes difficult not to feel for each one.After seven nominations, Winslet finally wins an Oscar for Best Actress for her stunning performance as Hanna. She is able to make you have mixed feelings of overwhelming sympathy and intense disgust for such a simpleton. It makes me wonder though, why she has to keep shedding her clothes in most of her roles when she doesn't really need to, with her incredible talent. Kross is a revelation and holds his own screen presence against such a formidable co-star. It was also interesting to find out that the production had to wait till he turned 18 to film his love scenes and that he had to learn English for this breakout role. Ralph Fiennes plays the older Michael, and while I originally thought it was a waste to cast him for this part, I later realized how crucial his eyes and expressions were in communicating volumes of feeling, even in the slightest of dialogues.While heavy, The Reader is still a must-see, if only to get back to contemplating on your basic humanity. 'What would you have done?' is the question Hanna poses to the judge, and would be interesting to ask yourself. Elements of many parts of this movie would make for a fruitful after-movie discourse.",7,2,4,23 February 2009
Hancock," Short, good fun!
","Unique enough in its storyline albeit a little too obvious in its exposition, it's easy to see why Hancock would be something Will Smith would do. After all, he has admitted to his box-office formula of choosing movies with killer special effects to make him a star. He disturbed this pattern by doing The Pursuit of Happiness, but his trailblazing ways is apparent once more in choosing to be Hancock, the anti-hero.Yes, Smith plays the lonely superhero John Hancock, who acts out his depression by being an alcoholic bum. He saves ever-the-optimist PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who insists on repaying Hancock by reinventing his image. This means hanging out with Hancock quite a lot, much to the chagrin of Ray's uptight wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) but to the wild delight of their son Aaron (Jae Head).What is surprisingly great about this movie is the acting. Of course Smith effortlessly provides the believable action/comedy necessary, but Theron did fantastic work for a role that could have easily been so shallow, or worse, bad. A formidable figure indeed! Also worth noting is Head, who was charming; thankfully not of the annoyingly perky child star variety.Hancock may be easily guessable, but while it's tame enough to give it a PG-13 rating, it has enough wow factors keep true action aficionados in their seats. Now that's smartly distributing one's eggs in several baskets.",8,0,5,7 July 2008
Shooter," Unlike Bruce Willis who can pull off corny scenes with a well-timed smirk and nifty lines, Wahlberg's style as an action star is more like Matt Damon: serious and efficient.
","Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Tears of the Sun) takes too long to unravel this story based on Stephen Hunter's novel Point of Impact.Which is a shame, since Mark Wahlberg is convincing as Bob Lee Swagger, an excellent marksman who has taken up a hermit's life after the death of his spotter and best friend (played by Lane Garrison, who incidentally also plays the quickly killed off 'Tweener' in Prison Break). Sought to help figure out an assassination plot against the president, Swagger reluctantly agrees to help but finds himself double-crossed and framed. On the run, he sets out to find the real killer. In true Rambo fashion, he takes on hordes of enemies practically all on his own.Danny Glover is subtle as the evil Colonel Isaac Johnson, and Michael Peña (World Trade Center) is also good in his role as the unassuming FBI agent Nick Memphis. It's just a pity that Memphis' dialogue and connection with Alourdes Galindo (played by Rhona Mitra, a TV staple on Nip/Tuck, The Practice and Boston Legal), the sexytary with the inside info, was not convincing and felt very contrived. Her appearances were just too convenient. Also in the supporting cast is Kate Mara (Brokeback Mountain) who plays Sarah Fenn, Swagger's bestfriend's widow. Sadly, her roles becomes the trite damsel in distress who of course knows how to sew, with gratuitous shots of her in a state of undress. But one couldn't really complain because she was eclipsed by Wahlberg's own naked torso scenes.While there are quite a number of terrific action sequences, overall, it was quite draggy, with some unforgivably corny parts (the terrible musical score doesn't help either!). Unlike Bruce Willis who can pull off corny scenes with a well-timed smirk and nifty lines, Wahlberg's style as an action star is more like Matt Damon: serious and efficient.",6,1,5,22 April 2007
Inception," Inception is movie perfection!
","Super blown away by Inception! I can't get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick. At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along. This is just unbelievably good!!! He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much. All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio, in a rare way, fades into the character and you forget his celebrity. Everyone and everything is just amazing; from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematography...all I could say at the end of the flick was, WOW!",10,19,40,15 July 2010
WALL·E," Special
","It's uncanny: no words surface for the better part of Wall-E and similarly, no words can describe what a brilliant piece of animation it is. Even more amazing is how Oscar-winning director and writer Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc., A Bug's Life) can keep churning out one awesome full-length animation after another.It's quite a risk to return to the realm of silent movies, offering it to an increasingly skeptical, harder-to-please audience with short attention spans. And, as if that wasn't challenging enough, make its success heavily reliant on a story that's verbalized by the personalization of robots that are able to communicate only by weird sounds and awkward body language.But this is Pixar's gift; the ability to bring legitimate human experiences in animated form. I didn't particularly like Cars, so I'm glad they've finally humanized inanimate objects better in Wall-E, enough for the audience to actually feel for the characters. It hearkens back to Disney's Lady and the Tramp, with the scruffy boy Wall-E who goes out on a limb for a girl way out of his league (Eve). Even the supporting cast is memorable; I especially like the little super OC cleaner robot and Wall-E's survivor of a pal the cockroach! It's at once ridiculous and magical, really, and even more special is when you find yourself spontaneously bursting with laughter in unguarded moments because that is indeed a rarity.",9,0,3,17 August 2008
The Good Shepherd," People will watch this film because of the stellar cast
","Robert de Niro stars in, produces and directs The Good Shepherd, a story based on the life of the founder of the CIA's counterintelligence operations, James Jesus Angelton (Edward Wilson in the story).People will watch this film because of the stellar cast: Matt Damon plays Wilson and Angelina Jolie plays his long-suffering wife Margaret. Robert de Niro, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, William Hurt and Alec Baldwin give ample supporting roles. While Jolie believably ages through the story, Damon doesn't seem to age at all; however, he remains as quiet and stony-faced as his character.While the cast generally delivers on the acting front, the movie needs sharper editing; it runs on too long. The exposition sometimes has sparks of brilliance but overall it can be tedious.Also, the situations can be quite ridiculous. I find it unbelievable for Wilson to be forced to marry Angelina Jolie (hello!). Also, with their genes, how could they have borne such a stupid and ugly son (bad casting!)? How he is able to become a powerful veteran operative was also not satisfactorily shown; it is just narrated and taken as fact. He shows dedication but not passion; it seems he has no reason to stay on at his job if he is so detached from everything, even from his son whom he claims to love.The movie ends abruptly, despite the length; there seems to be no justification in the end.",7,2,3,12 March 2007
Music and Lyrics," A cutesy, feel good romantic comedy, a bit draggy in some parts but it does have its sparks of wit
","Alex Fletcher is an 80s has-been (Hugh Grant) from the duo Pop!, and he needs to compose a hit for a Britney equivalent, Cora Corman (Haley Bennett, who has eerily dead eyes like those of Bjork's), in an attempt to boost his flagging career. Since he's more of a musician than a writer, he finds help from his plant lady Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore).Pop!'s video at the start of the film establishes where Alex comes from and it admittedly had an authentic feel of an 80s music video. Grant has left his usual womanizing cad characters with this film, and like his character, is unashamedly true to his range. Alex has no qualms being called a 'has-been', has no angst nor pride. Barrymore is luminous in this role and like Grant, plays this sort of character well. Grant and Barrymore effectively work as a tandem because they embrace their genre and unabashedly play it to the hilt so they never really have to try so hard.Alex is given depth and not just the easygoing man he appears to be. When Alex convinces Sophie to confront her ex, 'People wait their whole lives to see an ex when things are going really good. It NEVER happens. You could make relationship history!' people can relate to that. And when he justifies how pop songs are superior to literature ('Let's see how reading a novel can make you feel better in five minutes just like a pop song can'), and when he gives Sophie a much-needed reality check by calling her on her pity party. In the end, we realize that Alex is a brilliant popstar after all and Sophie is not just a cerebral Lit major, because they are able to relate to the average person on an emotional level in the amount of time it takes to do so: a five-minute pop song.Music & Lyrics is a cutesy, feel good romantic comedy, a bit draggy in some parts but it does have its sparks of wit.",6,0,0,25 February 2007
1408," now this is a good horror flick!
","'Stay scared.' That is what famed horror novelist Mike Enslin (John Cusack) would tell his fans during booksigning, and that's exactly what you feel for the better part of the movie. In this chilling short story by Stephen King directed by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström, you WILL scream in spite of yourself. I saw this alone in my room one night and I endured the good creepy build-up leading to skeptical Enslin's fateful entry into Room 1408 of the haunted Dolphin Hotel. I liked the motivated use of extreme close-ups to add to the claustrophobia, and the bird's eye view shots that give a feeling of someone watching over everything. The scary, unsettling cinematography and the masterful, fragmented visuals really make you feel the fear. Cusack makes 1408 work. His almost one-man act makes a good case of cynicism at the beginning. When he says: 'sarcophagal chambers; hotel rooms are naturally creepy places' you just keep waiting to be defied. I will never hear The Carpenters' 'We've Only Just Begun' the same way again nor look at radio clocks as innocent harbingers of time. You keep expecting the worst. You share his panic and frustration. For your own self-preservation, you want to believe him when he tries to talk sense to his tape recorder to calm himself. The 'power of suggestion' is indeed very strong; the score and sound effects are effective and thoughtful, with enough moments and good pacing for you to sober up till the next. The momentum is destroyed, however, when the specters are actually shown. Major plot hole: why suddenly think of his laptop and cell phone too late? The monster-like thing bent on hacking him also had a pathetic mask; and then it just starts getting silly (check out what gets faxed to him), then melodramatic in the exposition of his own 'personal ghosts' that he is helplessly exorcising. He is forced to just 'ride it out' like the aftermath of a hallucination gone awry.Then it starts to get even more fantastic and ridiculous, getting harder to accept as even stranger things happen in the 'Kafkaesque hotel'. Cusack is just such an excellent actor that you still are emotionally tied to him despite the circumstances and share his despair of getting yanked back and forth into alternate realities. Reliving the horror of loss with him was cruel, rude and shocking, but the cheesy dialogue punctuated with the wry humor only he can truthfully deliver helped.",9,1,2,12 July 2007
Step Up," Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie
","Choreographer and now director Anne Fletcher hits the mother lode with this gem of a dance flick! Having painfully seen similar dance-themed teen movies in the past (Take the Lead, Save the Last Dance, etc.), Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie. Hindi nagtipid sa pasikat.Unlike similar movies where the audience agonizingly waits through scene after scene of boredom for a grand dance finale (which usually fails to enthrall anyway), Step Up treats the audience to several impressive, memorable sequences thoughtfully scattered throughout the movie. Finally, we are entertained by a dance flick where the leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) are both beautiful to watch, have good chemistry (enough to sustain the kilig factor) and can really deliver the moves.Dewan is a superb dancer; she has a fabulously fit body, not the anorexic ballerina type, and she dons her outfits exceptionally well for someone who's only 5'3'. It was also amazing to watch such a tall, gorgeous man like Tatum move the way he does (it must help that the boy knows his Kung Fu!). His deadpan facial expression makes his line deliveries unexpectedly funny. The supporting cast also amply sustains the rest of the story. Step Up churns out enough high points that you pardon its hiccuppy subplots and scene-stealing extras.",9,56,69,11 November 2006
Iron Man," Underpromised and overdelivered!
","Surprisingly fun! The trailer definitely underpromised and overdelivered. Watched Iron Man as requisite summer movie blockbuster viewing; ended up happily enjoying it. The incredibly talented Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man work by animating the character with his own inherent eccentricities.Iron Man draws several parallels with other superheroes. For one, he has a lot in common with Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a rich, orphan playboy gifted with the aptitude for high technology. Instead of having the elderly Alfred as butler, however, Stark has personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), a pair of artificially intelligent robots (adorable scene stealers that have adapted puppy-like personalities) and best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). Just like Superman, he sleeps with a reporter, Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb), and has someone close to him for his arch nemesis.Writer/actor/producer/director Jon Favreau is a revelation, helming this action-adventure flick with disarming deftness; it's clear he enjoyed directing this film. How can he not with an unexpectedly well-written, relevant script and a talented cast that includes the chameleon-like Jeff Bridges and cameos from Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects are excellent and the editing was just right, even if it runs over two hours. Overcoming its corny name, Iron Man has all the makings of a successful franchise!",9,7,15,1 May 2008
Casino Royale," Amazing action for the first half or so...
","The people behind James Bond catch up to the lucrative angle of resurrecting the franchise with a prequel in Casino Royale, Bond's first mission as 007. In what is supposedly the first of the entire Bond series, newcomer Daniel Craig reprises the role as the youngest, blondest Bond. Don't expect early James to be as suave or refined as the others; here, he is still very much crude and arrogant, packaged as an efficient, feral killing machine.While Craig has the best Bond body yet, he is eons away from his pretty boy predecessors. His oozing masculinity could not obviously translate into the smooth alter ego that his character needs. His face is too primordial to successfully evolve, even when clad in a tailored monkey suit. His leading lady Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) had to verbalize this in their first meeting in the train scene, the producers' caveat in case it's lost on the viewers. She had to say that he wears his clothes indifferently, etc. Having to tell the audience this, instead of it just being shown, revealed a possible insecurity/defense of this choice for Bond. His is a cold, savage face of a killer.Meanwhile, Green is reminiscent of a more mature Jennifer Love Hewitt; she does not do justice to her character as a quintessential object of lust/Bond girl (well she is, after all, playing an accountant). Her frame is too slight and her face too overly made up; nothing great. Only the villains were perfectly cast, even Le Chiffre's girl was much hotter.Still, this movie showcases amazing action for the first half or so, most especially the Madagascar chase at the cockfight through the construction and embassy. You can, however, skip the pathetic Mediterranean lovey-dovey boat cruise portion with the straining Titanic-like strings at the background. What a shame, having already gotten the ever-cool Chris Cornell to supply the opening theme, with the clever intro credits.",7,0,9,21 November 2006
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Decent, entertainment-wise...

Beowulf," Despite all the Gaiman gore and humor, Beowulf surprisingly still feels empty.
","Despite all the Gaiman gore and humor, the Robert Zemeckis-helmed Beowulf surprisingly still feels empty. The still-evolving CGI effects should not be blamed, since the first two installments of Shrek successfully delivered the warmth necessary to emotionally connect with its audience.Beowulf is a famous epic poem set in Denmark about the warrior Beowulf, who paints himself as a larger-than-life hero. He successfully defeats the monster Grendel, who has been going on a killing spree, however, beautiful women like the monster's mother is his ultimate weakness.Big stars like Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn and Anthony Hopkins headline this movie. But even with that and all the digital 3D hype it's brought (the level of detail is amazing, the blending of what's real and CGI is almost undetectable), what makes it still feel flat? There is nothing specific to pinpoint except for a 'feeling': that the time spent watching it was not worth it.Also, while the horror portions were indeed frightening, more shocking is how the film was able to get away with just a PG-13 rating despite all the violence, gore, nudity and adult themes. Probably because it was mostly animated, but even when the animation was so close to reality? Just strange, that's all",6,0,8,18 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Super fun!
","Super fun! I agree with some reviews that Die Hard 4.0 is like Rocky Balboa: you watch it not expecting much from the latest regurgitated version of a popular series but you end up enjoying it immensely. This approach works because it sticks to its roots of why people liked the original in the first place: unstoppable, heart-pounding action coupled with well-placed comic relief.The unsinkable Bruce Willis reprises his role as super-cop John McLane with still the right amount of cockiness. No matter what situation he's in, you can't help but root for the guy and believe in the amazing stuff that he gets to do! While Timothy Olymphant (in his metrosexual garb) isn't much of a scary nemesis for our burly hero (and his able foil, played by the forever geeky Justin Long) compared to past arch-enemies, his partner-in-crime Maggie Q provided enough action for the both of them. There are just too many incredible action sequences in this flick that's poised to entertain. Loads of fun!",9,1,3,16 July 2007
Pineapple Express," Eh. *shrug*
","Twenty-something Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) serves subpoenas for a living, has an eighteen-year old girlfriend in highschool and gets his regular stash from loopy pusher Saul Silver (James Franco), who sells him a rare kind of weed called Pineapple Express. Dale unfortunately becomes an eyewitness to a murder involving the drug lords and now has to run for his life while protecting the people he has come to love.Was really looking forward to this purported laughfest but it unfortunately fell short on the chuckles and rambled on too long. A noteworthy revelation, however, is Franco as Saul the stoner. He is able to transform himself from his previous pretty boy roles into ultimate grungy slacker mode and can actually be comedic. Rogen played it safe and disappoints in this flick, while the rest of the supporting cast just continued to be shockingly violent idiots. Surprising are the rave reviews this one got; it wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be.",5,2,8,5 October 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," funny and heartwarming, modern without being cold...
","Slumdog Millionaire deserves its Golden Globe sweep (Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Screenplay). The surprise hit will jolt you out of your ennui from all sides. Simon Beaufoy based the screenplay on Vikas Swarup's bestselling novel 'Q and A', about Jamal Malik, a poor orphan from the slums who wins the US$410,000 jackpot on 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire?' to attract the attention of the woman he loves. He is accused of cheating, however, and to explain how he managed to answer each question, he recounts the fascinating tale that is his life.Director Danny Boyle (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, The Beach) and director for India Loveleen Tandan produced a frenetic film that still manages to be riveting enough to focus on equal parts colorful Indian landscape and gritty human reality, allowing you to experience a wide range of emotions. The original score by A.R. Rahman complements the visual assault with a fluid infusion of Indian-flavored electronic beats.The film is brilliantly cast, with Dev Patel as the older Jamal, Madhur Mittal as Jamal's older brother Salim, and Freida Pinto as the older Latika, Jamal's childhood friend and ultimate love interest. The three main characters' stories unravel from their past lives, and the actors who play them in their early teens and childhood all contributed marvelously (Boyle was reportedly crushed to learn of some of child actors' real poverty-stricken lives, and ensured them of their education and trust funds).Slumdog Millionaire is a socially-relevant drama that's also funny and heartwarming, modern without being cold. Consistent with Boyle's style, despite tackling dark themes, it still has room for positive vibes, daring you to see the beauty in despair. It may not be a Bollywood flick but it ends in traditional Bollywood style: a grand production number!",9,1,5,12 January 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," an extended version of its trailer
","The Pursuit of Happiness is an extended version of its trailer, which pretty much already tells the against-all-odds story of how a down-and-out salesman (Will Smith) chases after a job that he has no background on while caring for his son (Jaden Smith).Based on the life of Chris Gardner, The Pursuit of Happiness tells of how he overcame every daunting obstacle in his life by sheer perseverance. Despite all the terrible things that just kept happening to him, he never wavered his focus on what mattered most: to be a good father to his son Chris Jr.Gardner wasn't perfect all around, but he showed how he achieved the American dream (hence the repeated references to the Declaration of Independence) by making the best of whatever situation he was in and doggedly pursuing his ambition to have a better life for him and his son. Even in his desperation, he found solace in the Declaration: 'And it was at that time that I thought about Benjamin Franklin. Him saying that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I thought about how he knew to put the 'pursuit' in there, like no one can actually have happiness. We can only pursue it.' One particularly emotionally-charged scene was when father and son were playing ball, and Gardner warns Chris Jr. not to spend too much time with basketball because his son wouldn't be good at it anyway, because he wasn't good at it either. When Chris Jr.'s glee turns into a hurt mope, Gardner realizes his mistake and tells the five-year old, 'You have a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period. Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do.' It was refreshing to see Smith play something other than his usual romantic lead or wisecracking action star. In Pursuit, he is bravely out of his comfort zone, without humor as a fall back. He does his dramatic scenes convincingly with help from his real-life son (with Jada Pinkett Smith). Smith proves that he is ready to pursue acting for real with the same bulldog determination as his character.",7,0,1,28 January 2007
Valkyrie," Educational and entertaining
","Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men, X2, Superman Returns) steps away from his typical fantastic stories and instead embarks on a straight-forward historical drama with Valkyrie.Based on the true story of the German resistance's plot to kill Hitler, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a decorated war hero secretly against the Fuhrer. He gets an opportunity to do something about it by joining the German resistance, and they plot a daring coup to topple Hitler's Germany.Carice van Houten (who oddly looks like Vilma Santos!) plays von Stauffenberg's wife Nina, and while without much dialogue, effectively transmits emotion on screen with the slightest of expressions. This acting style is strongly echoed by the rest of the cast: Kenneth Branagh (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Hamlet) plays the cunning Major-General Henning von Tresckow, who enlists him in the resistance; Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Notes on a Scandal, Love Actually) plays the wishy-washy General Friedrich Olbricht and Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) plays the careerist General Friedrich Fromm. The handsome Thomas Kretschmann (The Pianist, King Kong) plays yet another ironic role as Nazi supporter, Major Otto Ernst Remer.Reminiscent of Ang Lee's Lust, Caution, Valkyrie is beautifully told in bittersweet fashion. The suspense and drama are efficiently translated by the stellar cast, told in a wonderful, old-school way of storytelling. Educational and entertaining.",8,5,10,21 February 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Irresistibly hilarious!
","Irresistibly hilarious! It's awesome how The Simpsons can still manage to make us seriously laugh after all these years, in its trademark brand of wit and self-deprecating humor. Despite having already seen some funny vignettes in the trailers, they are still funny when seen again in the movie (in 2-D! as Moe proudly says), and it's a big relief that there's actually more of those in the full-length movie. Another brilliant thing about The Simpsons: each character, no matter how small a role, is memorable and likable. The lead characters, especially, manage to make you care about them no matter how radically different their personalities are: Homer, the dimwitted husband to Marge, the ever-forgiving and perfect wife and mother to Bart, the wise-ass troublemaker; Lisa, the idealistic wunderchild; and the quietly intriguing baby Maggie. Then of course the slew of other characters that would be impossible not to name (as they had in the trailer): Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Otto, Apu, Mr. Burns and Smithers...Stay till the end to hear Maggie say her first word!",9,1,2,5 August 2007
Up in the Air," a toss-up between keeping lofty dreams and discovering the empty reality
","Jason Reitman directs Up in the Air, a story he began writing in 2002 with Sheldon Turner when the US economy was thriving. It was supposed to be his first feature, but he ended up making Thank You for Smoking (2005) and Juno (2007) first. With the onset of the economic recession, the delay in Up in the Air's release became timelier.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)'s job has him flying around the country as a professional firer. He enjoys his lack of attachment and even moonlights as a motivational speaker to spread his philosophy of having no baggage, concretized by a convenient pseudo-relationship Ryan has with his lady equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Despite this, he successfully empathizes with the difficult, emotional turbulence firing people takes; he takes no joy out of this but he does have a secret wish: to rack up 10M frequent flyer miles and attain the ultimate elite card. So when his company takes on young upstart Natalie Keener (Twilight's Anna Kendrick), who proposes a cost-cutting measure by firing people online instead, Ryan has a lot more convincing to do, which could challenge the very core of the philosophy he preaches.I laud the way the characters are written because they are all complex. Clooney's role is so eerily reflective of how he portrays himself in real-life (being the eternal bachelor) that it isn't a stretch to see him play Ryan. However, his performance also allowed audiences a glimpse of his vulnerable side, which his usually cocky demeanor never shows. While Oscar Best Actress nominee Farmiga did her usual disrobing, the surprise this time is that she used a body double, having just given birth. Performance wise, her muted expressions were the perfect blend for the grand reveal her character delivers near the end. 1998 Tony Best Actress nominee Anna Kendrick was able to hold her own beside the two stars as Natalie; she successfully gets you to admire her, hate her and feel sorry for her all at once.If the clips of the people reacting to being fired makes you flinch at its rawness, it may be because they were real people who were recently laid off. They were reportedly asked to look at the camera as if it were the person who fired them and reenact what they did, or say what they hoped they had. Juxtaposing that with images of vacant office spaces made the scenes feel real for the audience, an effort that effectively translates genuine emotion on screen.I would have preferred a different ending, perhaps one that ties everything up neatly, but if the objective is to stay truthful, then life never really turns out to be that simple. We already know that we won't always get what we want, but in the off chance that we do achieve it, it sucks to sometimes realize that it wasn't what we expected; it's a toss-up between keeping lofty dreams and discovering the empty reality.",7,2,3,15 February 2010
Atonement," Not a very faithful adaptation of the book
","Not a very faithful adaptation of the book, and a lot of details were omitted: the history behind the broken vase, more of Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)'s horrible experiences while at war, the gypsy woman and her pig, what happened to Lola and Paul Marshall, why Briony couldn't publish her tell-all novel yet and how she ultimately celebrates her birthday at the old house.The book was a bit annoying to read as author Ian McEwan did not allow readers to have their own imaginings; he painstakingly dictated each detail and embarrassingly disclosed each character's private thoughts, which of course, is impossible to translate on screen. But the beauty of the novel is the real ending (not the film's version), when it all comes together and explains why the book was written the way it was for the better part of the story.But the film did justice to the lush backdrops as described in the book, and the characters are well cast. Except perhaps for James McAvoy, who acted superbly but needed to be a bit burlier and taller (Briony was taller than him during the confrontation when he was supposed to be intimidatingly towering over her!). The actresses who played Briony at 13, at 18 and in her 70s all possessed the face and the manner you'd love to hate. Keira Knightley was beautiful and played the role of the haughty, careless but passionate aristocrat Cecilia perfectly. Paul Marshall was supposed to have some disfiguring facial feature that made him even more despicable, and Lola Quincey was supposed to be slenderer and prettier, but Juno Temple's portrayal was eerily exact.Visually arresting, the accompanying soundtrack and effects were also masterful, but the ending could've used a bit more help.",7,0,1,4 February 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Will Ferrell strikes loads of inappropriate laughs once more
","In true Anchorman fashion (with the same director), Will Ferrell strikes loads of inappropriate laughs once more in Talladega Nights as redneck racer Ricky Bobby.Ferrell has a unique comedic quality of getting away with really ridiculous humor. Although, I just could not manage to laugh whenever his ill-mannered sons (aptly named Walker and Texas Ranger!) sass at their grandfather. Especially during the scene where their family was having a thanksgiving meal and Ricky Bobby defends his children for talking really rudely to their shocked grandfather, and this makes Mrs. Bobby (Leslie Bibb) hot for her hubby and they make out real bad on top of the table in front of their family.But that aside, this movie has a lot of funny moments, like when Ricky Bobby sticks a knife in his thigh and when he verbally spars with his French competitor Jean Girard (played by the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen/Ali G). The rest of the cast amply support their larger-than-life lead. Worth noting is John C. Reilly, who plays Bobby's best friend and forever wingman Cal. He was probably playing himself, having been successfully portraying the average Joe forever that no one quite remembers, as he transforms himself very well into any character he plays.",7,0,1,11 November 2006
