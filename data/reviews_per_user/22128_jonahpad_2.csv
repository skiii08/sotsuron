Blade Runner 2049," Boring
","I was looking forward to this film, turned out I had to force myself to watch it. Slow pace, dragging, scenes that made no sense at all, I found it a boring and pointless waste of my time. A long way from the brilliant original, hard to see where it got an 8+ rating from. Good acting failed to rescue the non event this film was.",5,3,5,11 January 2018
Ready Player One," Excellent Interpretation of the Book
","The movie is not the same as the book in many ways, but the screenplay was done with Ernest Cline fully involved - so if it is OK with the author then that is fine it is the Author's right to do what he wants with it. Besides which American movie studios have totally misrepresented actual historical events to the point of sillyness in film it seems a bit ludicrous to castigate a movie about a VR world and game for not being 'true' - laughable really. As for the actual movie it was brilliant, well scripted, pacey, just the right mixture of every aspect of making a proper action movie by the numbers, which Mr Spielberg, as always makes look effortless. As a child of the 70s / 80s and a gamer I loved everything about the movie, I still have a working Atari 2600 console and a PET and a Dragon stashed and a Commodore 64 stashed somewhere, and some games. The cultural references in the movie were and are an integral part of my life and work ever since. So for me this movie was a blast from the past and hugely enjoyable. Not Oscar materiel but then neither was Star Wars or Back to the Future, and look what boring rubbish did win top awards in the 80s - Driving Miss Daisy was one - seriously! My point is that Ready Player One is about gaming and computing history and pop culture underneath the story, so it does not really matter about the story I loved it for the sheer joy of trivia that is important to millions of the original geek generation I was, and still am, a fully paid up member being displayed. Lastly the one thing as a kid I used to dream of was a fully immersive VR gaming system, as did probably everyone else my age into arcade games, and yes it did start with Adventure and The Atari 2600 and now I have Occulus Rift - so this move may turn out to be close to the truth in 2045. How ironic that would be for Hollywood who where they never knowingly tell the truth about anything.",9,5,10,19 June 2018
