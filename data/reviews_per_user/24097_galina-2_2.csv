The Blair Witch Project," What a disappointment!
","Scariest movie ever?  Gimme a break.  Okay, there was one lesson I learned, that is, never go hiking without a map and a compass.  And yes, acting is good.  But otherwise, I felt a victim of a clever marketing ploy, and it's not exactly the best feeling to experience leaving the theatre.  A very decent piece of filmmaking, but never up to its promise.",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," The Scandinavian Magnificent Seven (or 13)? Give me a break...
","I am a big Banderas fan, and have been dying to see an honest action movie for way too long.  However, this is another disappointment.  Unless you are under 14, you are not likely to believe that 13 men can defeat hordes of brutal horsemen, aren't you?  And the goofs, oh Lord!  Say, when the good guys dive in a cave stream in what seems like the middle of the Earth itself, and all of a sudden the underwater world is brightly lit, like they are snorkeling in Fiji or whatever.  What a way to lose $7.50...",Null,0,0,28 August 1999
