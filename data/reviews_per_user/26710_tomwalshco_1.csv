National Treasure: Book of Secrets," 2 1/2 hours of my life gone forever
","This movie was awful. The worst since that damn Samurai thing from T Cruise.The Queen's private office, the Oval Office, spelunking with the prez - come on, give me a break.Of course, toss in romantic make-up ordeals with Voight, Mirren, Cage & Kruger and you can't get to the barf bag fast enough. The argument scene on the steps at Buckingham was so painful I had to hit the mute button.Did you see Boy Wonder grab for a piece of gold in the cave and try to shove it in his knapsack? Given the size of that thing in real life it had to weigh 300+ lbs, but he was hoisting it around like a box of Cheerios. Jeez. I was half expecting Wile E Coyote & the Roadrunner to dash into the cave and save the day....Most of the 3 Stooges movies I've seen in my life had better plots than this piece of crap.I looked at the Yahoo movie review site for this turd and tons of people were giving this A+s. I thought I was reading a review for Gone With The Wind. Oh yea, the oil they lit on fire has been trickling down those stairway troughs for 500 years??? Did the Mayans have circulating pumps at their disposal? Must have picked them up at Walmart or Home Depot.I know this was supposed to be a light-hearted, action thriller, check your brain at the door thing, but it was just too painful in all categories.",1,2,3,14 March 2009
