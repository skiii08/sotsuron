Sucker Punch," This Punch Doesn't Suck, But...
","It's not normal for me to be on the fence about a film, but this is an abnormal film. I guess I'd have to say that I actually like two thirds of it; which means that if you like it I can I'm with you, and if you don't I understand. From the time Baby Doll gets her weapons the film really came alive for me. I enjoyed the action sequences (loved the dragon), and the hot outfits. You may have a difficult time trying to figure out which of the girls is the most attractive (I settled on the Amber character). But for many the plot will be confusing and hard to follow. So if you must see it on the big screen let me know your thoughts, otherwise if you are unsure I would suggest waiting for DVD.",6,7,18,25 March 2011
