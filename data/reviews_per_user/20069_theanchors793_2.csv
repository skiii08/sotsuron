Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not Very Impressed, but worth seeing
","Basically most things I thought would be good about this movie were wrong. I had not planned on this being as good as the first, which I still think, but I had counted on Johnny Depp to carry the show. I hate to admit it but I think he really did nowhere near his best. All his jokes and mannerisms seemed severely overused and halfway through the film I honestly was tired of him, but to his credit he did keep it going through some dry points.I also wasn't thrilled that there was going to be mermaids and another love story at first but I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought Sam Claffin was very good in his role as the missionary and so was Astrid Berges-Frisbey was brilliant in her role. These two had great chemistry and as the movie progressed I started caring more about their story than that of Jack and Blackbeard.On the subject of Blackbeard, I was very disappointed and thought he was a very mediocre villain. Nothing about his story matched with legend and he somehow had unexplained mystical voodoo and control over strange ropes and could 'zombify' his crew. His 'daughther' Penelope Cruz was a bit underwhelming but she still did a decent job. On a positive note I really like Geoffrey Rush, like always.All in all, go see it. Don't take this review for anything if you don't agree and if you love the movie that's great for you. Just an honest opinion of the film.",5,2,2,5 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," Wow...
","I love superhero movies. However, very rarely do I say that they are good movies.That being said, this was a great movie.There are many great things going for this movie. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely brilliant. I was stunned at the level of acting I saw from these two considering this very rare in superhero movies. I border on saying Fassbender's performance is Oscar-worthy.I haven't seen a performance this good since Colin Firth in the King's Speech. McAvoy also gave a very impressive performance. As with most comic book movies today there were liberties taken from the comic book but I excused it as it was pulled off fairly well. The plot was much more driven and on course as opposed to the previous installment which was all over the place.Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique was much better than the previous actress and she added life to the character. There really wasn't a bad acting performance seen as in the other movies.The visual effects were incredible. Seeing Magneto pull the submarine out of the water was breathtaking and didn't look fake like many other movies. I would say go see even if you're not a X-men fan as I was quite impressed.",9,6,10,16 June 2011
