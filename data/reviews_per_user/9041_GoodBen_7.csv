Casablanca," Review for Casablanca
","Growing up, I'd heard a lot about this movie, but I've never actually seen it. Now that I have, I understand why Casablanca is so well liked. It has a strong, suspenseful plot, excellent acting, an exotic setting, great dialogue, and many humorous moments. Maybe it's best thought of as a drama/romance. It tells the story of two former lovers, America expatriate, and bar owner, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), who meet again and find themselves in a love triangle with the woman's husband, Victor Laszlo, leader of the Czech underground. It's set in the city of Casablanca in unoccupied North Africa during WWII. While the war actually hasn't reached Casablanca, the city is full of Nazi soldiers, who create a constant sense of menace and dread. They're after Laszlo, and he and Ilsa need to escape. In order to do that, they need transit papers. Rick has the papers and needs to decide what to do with them. The story is filled with moments of edge of the seat suspense as we wonder if Laszlo and Ilsa will escape or become victims of the Nazi's. We also wonder if Ilsa will stay with Rick or choose her husband. The acting is excellent. Bogart's Rick is a complex man with a past. A former freedom fighter himself, he's become a jaded man who claims not to care about anyone but himself. Bergman's Ilsa is obviously torn between Rick and her husband. The viewer is faced with asking if Rick will do the right thing and who Ilsa will choose. The movie is made even better by the frequently humorous moments, many offered by Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who does an excellent job as the cynical and corrupt head of the local police. From beginning to end, I found this film to be totally enjoyable.",Null,2,3,16 October 2011
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver Review
","This seems like a crime-fighting vigilante movie to me. In it, we see how a mentally unstable veteran, played by Robert DeNiro, gradually deteriorates to an out of control vigilante who is fed up with the problems of society and decides to take matters into his own hands. The plot is filled with tension and action. This, along with its setting, the rough streets of New York with prostitutes and criminals, makes for an interesting story. I enjoyed DeNiro's performance as the increasingly out of control Travis, as well as Jodie Foster's performance as Iris, the child prostitute he decides to save. I liked the scene towards the ending where DeNiro made his way through the apartment building battling all of the thugs trying to save Iris. I also was surprised to find out that he lived, even though he was shot up and was still going.",10,0,0,16 December 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Grapes of Wrath Review
","The Grapes of Wrath gives us a look into what life was like for the displaced farm families and the migrant workers during the Great Depression. It does this by following the struggles of the Joad family, Midwesterners who lost their farm, as they try to make it to California and a better life. Overall, I found this film to be enjoyable in that it held my interest and made me feel like I was learning about an important piece of American history that's often forgotten. One positive aspect of the movie was the acting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, a young farmer, and John Carradine as Tom Casy a former preacher. I was also struck by the perseverance and hopefulness of the Joad family. Even though one misfortune after another happens to them, they never give up hope. There seems to be a message here about how people can come out okay no matter how bad their situation is if they keep trying. On a less positive note, some of the travel scenes were a bit boring and could have been shortened.",Null,0,0,11 October 2011
The Exorcist," The Exorcist review
","This movie didn't scare me as much as it did amaze me by the all the special effects. Some of the effects made me wonder how they did that or how they pulled that off. It was interesting to see how they put all these effects together. I also really like the makeup job they did with Reagan. I saw some of the test footage and I thought that was a little more frightening than what they came up with in the end. I liked how in the beginning they give you a sense that an evil presence had entered the house, but they don't actually show anything until Reagan gets possessed. That approach seemed to generated a great deal of tension and heighten the suspense. On a less positive note, I thought there is too much dialogue, especially in the extended edition.",10,1,2,16 December 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate review
","Overall, I liked this movie. It had some funny dialogue and a great soundtrack from Simon & Garfunkel .There were also some funny scenes, like when Ben's father makes him wear the scuba suit to show off to friends. However, I also thought this movie was very frustrating just because every time the character Ben tried to explain what really happened between him and Mrs. Robinson, no one believed him. Another frustration was the fact that Mrs. Robinson was being very mysterious as to why she wanted Ben all for herself. The movie always kept you guessing because you didn't know what would happen next or if Elaine and Benjamin would end up together. The ending also made me wonder what happens to them later.",8,2,2,16 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Just singin in the rain
","As far as musicals go, this movie was not that bad. After seeing this movie, I started to understand all the references that I've seen in the past about this movie that I didn't picked up on the first time around. The movie was very exciting and has lots of energy. This movie also gave you a better understanding of how silent films were starting to become outdated compared to the new talk films and problems it caused for actors and film directors. The plot of the film centered around that theme. I also like the sense of realism that they included with Gene Kelly performance when he was walking and singing in the rain and then the cop showed up. The one part I didn't like in the movie was the long dance scene where they show Gene Kelly going to the big city. Although I'm not a big fan of musicals I like this movie.",8,0,1,16 December 2011
Psycho," Psycho review
","This movie was the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I had ever seen. It was very suspenseful and realistic. This movie has a very different style compared to today's horror films which is more about blood and gore rather than suspense and mystery. I thought Anthony Perkins did a wonderful job as Norman Bates. I liked how he could go from playing innocent character to a psychotic madman. I also like Janet Leigh's performance. I think it's too bad that they never released a colored version of this film.I think more horror movies today should try being more suspenseful and adding mystery rather than blood and gore, but with today's horror fans, I doubt that will ever happen. It seems that we've lost touch with suspenseful horror movies and just get into the blood and violence. Every now and then, we do see a horror movie with suspense and mystery, but it always seems to get outnumbered by the slasher movies.",10,0,0,16 December 2011
