Lucky Number Slevin," Thrilling detective movie
","Lucky Number Slevin is a thrilling detective movie is unlike any other I've seen. It will keep you guessing (as all detective movies do) but with such finesse and suspense which will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end. The writing, directing and acting are excellent all around. As the main characters, Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis turn in super performances. Although their roles are smaller, but important, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman turn in the excellent performances expected of them. Likewise, the supporting character actors turn in very good performances. Except for a few minor flaws in the writing (deliberate, perhaps?), the plot, the pace, the drama, the relief are excellent. The photography of lower east side Manhattan as well as the towering, breathtaking, high rise, penthouse views of the super rich will be especially appreciated by New Yorkers and expatriates. Although it is early in the year, I expect this movie to walk away with the 2006 Academy Awards for movie, directing and acting. I am a frequent movie goer and this is one of, if not THE best movie I have seen in the last ten years.",10,3,12,9 April 2006
