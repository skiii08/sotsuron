Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More than what I expected...except for the blood
","To keep this amazingly short, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was much better than what I had expected.  The plot is more developed and the character, Black Mamba is better portrayed as a heroine(vs. just one angry woman)in this episode. Thus, placing abilities of Uma Thurman prominently in the limelight.  As well, the artistic efforts for each frame of the film is notably well thought out; each would make a really cool picture book! However, I was expecting more of a sword fight btw Bill and Beatrix, and more 'squriting blood'!  More so, I thought the end was just too abrupt and it needs more of what I call 'the cool-Tarantino-cheese.' Maybe, simply his style has grown-up? Though this film cannot be viewed as 2 separate entities, I must say, like classics such as the Godfather and the Godfather II, it has surpassed it's predecessor, Vol I, greatly.",8,1,2,17 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Typical Tarantino
","It was 'nifty' to see Anim√© and Japanese Samurai used as the backdrop of this film.  At first, the fountain like blood sprays provided the dark-twisted-comical quality that makes Tarantino flicks 'nifty'. However after 3/4 of the movie, it was just over done;losing it's meaning and losing my attention.  No matter what, casting Uma Thurman was simply smart. Thurman being one of the coolest cats in Hollywood, has certainly done her job right!  Ultimately, it was well worth my time, but it was too much of what I had expected a Tarantino film to be.  Maybe I'll be surprised in Vol II?",5,0,0,11 October 2003
