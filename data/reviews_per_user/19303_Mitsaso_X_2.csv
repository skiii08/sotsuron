Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The exact opposite of the first volume...but yet, equally cool!
","This movie is NOT what Kill Bill vol.1 fans would expect after the tornado of coolness that the first volume was. It's downright slower, this time based on dialogue and characters. It actually turns the 'bloodthirsty revenge' story into a very special love story...! I loved it as much as the first volume though! Just wanna point out that both films would be even better if they were combined from the beginning...the dialogue-heavy second part would be balanced by the thrilling first part, making a more complete film...I don't want to spoil the fun for you so I won't say what you should expect of that movie...but it surely makes the whole Kill Bill saga a complete saga...10 out of 10.",10,0,1,15 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Probably the coolest film ever made!! And it would have been even cooler if both volumes were together...
","Well, what can be said about the best movie of 2003?This film is the epitome of story-telling. Although it seems to be a simple revenge story, the way it unfolds to the viewer is simply breath-taking. Tarantino is using flash-backs, clever narration from Uma Thurman and even anime cartoons to make this story as cool as it can get...Well, yeah, maybe there's not enough character depth, and the classicly Tarantinesque dialogues are missing, but vol.2. certainly makes up for it...Kill Bill vol.1 is certainly thrilling enough to stand as one movie...and the semi-cliffhanger in the end is perfectly placed.It's a pity that Tarantino decided to split the movie in two volumes...the uncut version must be even more godlike. But I think I know why he split the film in half and released it in a 6 months space. He wanted Uma Thurman to be nominated for both volumes and win two Oscars with one movie lol!!! Too bad the Academy ignored her, cause she certainly deserved it...the moment where she wakes up from the coma and looks for her unborn child would be enough for me to knock on her door and give her the damn award!!!The film also gets a 10 out of 10 as well.",10,0,2,14 June 2004
