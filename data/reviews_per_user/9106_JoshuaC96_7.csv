Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca was not what I expected it to be when I started watching it. I assumed that it was just going to be a slow, straight forward love story set in an exotic place. However, I was completely wrong. The movie has a really meaningful story, and a super exciting, fast-paced plot. The love story you see take place in the film is already half over when the film starts. I thought that we were going to be able to see the two characters meet and fall in love, however they had already met and are already in love from the beginning of the film. Having the characters already share history and having their history revealed to us over time is a really gripping and impacting way to tell a story. Everything in the move from the music and lighting to dialogue and camera-work are great and work really well. The whole movie is really well made and is super entertaining.",9,0,2,16 October 2010
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","I liked this movie quite a bit. The movie starts of with an almost horrific tone. The first scene is more dark and ominous than Frankenstein. The cinematography in the movie was really interesting and used effects that I haven't seen in other movies from that time period. For instance, the movie used a lot of really low and really high camera angles, which were pretty cool. I also liked, during the scene when Thatcher was speaking to Kane's parents, how you could see Kane through the window outside playing. It was really cool because you could see how happy he was with his life the way he had it, while at the same time people were planning what would turn out to be an empty, unhappy life. I also thought that how the plot moved forward by jumping around in time through flashbacks was really cool. Everything in the film; the lighting, camera work, music, and overall atmosphere came together to make the story seem epic, which helped make the film really impacting. As depressing a movie as it is, it's really great.",8,1,2,16 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great film
","This was a pretty good movie. It's a really fun movie to watch. I also thought the acting in the film was really good. I especially enjoyed Paul Newman's performance. I loved all of the witty, humorous dialogue in the film, It's a western, but it's very different from any other western I've seen. The film is very funny and charismatic. It has a very modern feel that comes through most in things like the music and the way the characters act. It's one of the earliest westerns I've seen where the heroes of the story are actually the criminals running from the law. In most western films the heroes are the good guys. There were a couple moments in the film that I thought didn't work well. For example, there was a chase montage while the characters were in South America. It had really odd, somewhat annoying music, and it went on for way too long. I didn't like it and even fast-forwarded part of it. However, it was a pretty minor flaw and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie.Overall I really liked Butch Cassidy and the Sundace Kid.",8,0,0,16 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
","I thought that The Grapes of Wrath was a really good movie. The film really educates you on the hardship and struggle that these people had to endure. Many circumstances in the film make you feel greatly compassionate, sympathetic, or even angry. Such as the characters losing their homes, the conditions of the camps, and the harsh attitudes people had toward the farmers wherever they went. The film was really slick and well made, it flowed well and didn't get boring. The movie was well acted and well directed. The film has great cinematography, with a lot of great shots of the open road. You really feel like you're accompanying the characters on their journey and you don't know how it will turn out. Overall I was really impressed by this film.",8,0,1,13 October 2010
The Graduate," The Graduate is a classic
","I enjoyed The Graduate. It was a fun movie to watch; it had suspense, drama, humor, romance; everything required for an entertaining film. All of the actors gave good performances, especially Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. I love Simon and Garfunkel music, so that greatly added to my enjoyment of the movie.Ben Braddock is kind of a depressed guy who doesn't know what to do with his life. The Graduate is a great film for young people, especially college kids, because a lot of them can identify with the main character's feelings of being lost and not knowing what choices to make. The only problem I had with the movie is that Hoffman's character seemed kind of ditsy a lot of the time and made weird illogical decisions. However, his choices were what pushed the plot forward so it was easy to go along with.Overall I thought The Graduate was pretty great. There is a lot to like about the movie and it has a lot of meaning behind it. The film is more than 40 years old but it doesn't seem like it. It's a classic and is as good as any modern film.",9,1,1,8 December 2010
Psycho," Psycho
","I didn't really like Hitchcock's Psycho.The plot is way dated by today's standards. You can tell the film was made specifically to shock audiences in 1960, but today it fails miserably to be convincing; especially because of the film's constant attempts to keep you convinced that Norman's mother is the real killer. The film stresses this so much that other aspects of the plot suffer. For example, characters hardly ever have any logical thoughts/theories and don't make logical decisions or actions. I pretty much figured out that he'd already killed his mom from the moment her 'character' is introduced. I'm sure the film was fantastic when it first came out, but to me it just isn't any more. I can understand why many people would find the film to be really good. It was definitely groundbreaking and utilized a lot of interesting camera and editing techniques. Also I thought that Anthony Perkins' performance was great. However, it is by no means a timeless film like most of the movies we've seen in class. I'm sure I missed some deeper meaning or theme in Physco, but I was far too distracted to think about it and could hardly enjoy the film.",6,1,4,7 November 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Awesome!
","I totally loved One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The film is very intriguing and very hilarious at times. Every single character was really interesting and the actors all gave awesome performances. I thought it was really cool to see actors that I was familiar with, like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. It's probably the earliest film I've seen either of them in and it was really interesting to see them in something that came out before they became well known.I have to say that in my opinion Louise Fletcher gave one of the most fantastic performances in the film. She did an absolutely excellent job making you hate her. I've never loathed a character in a movie so much. Towards the end you really just want her to die, honestly. The film is deeply impacting. Sometimes it's totally depressing, and at other times it's really exciting and uplifting. I had a strong emotional response to the movie and I think it's probably one of my favorite films. The ending scene, when the chief throws the sink thing through the window was great; it's tough to decide whether to be sad or happy. I also thought that the Native American drums at the end were really cool.",10,1,2,16 December 2010
