Alien 3," All praise and no guns blaze
","In the vastness of space. Endless colonies. Humanity is scattered. God is absent. Or is He? The story of this movie is one of human altruism overcoming the cynic world of Alien. The first half of the movie is truly engaging with the characters setting the tone of the movie. True misery on the brink mayhem. The few leaders of the prison keep the order even though the people living there are all murderers and criminals of violent crimes.As Ripley enters the picture, the order is shock and a plethora of character interactions take place. The tension increases.Come the middle of the movie it slows down as the lead characters make plans. Plans to survive an assault they don't have the means to fend off.The ending is simply our strong protagonist choosing the correct path of action despite all the multiple 'gut feelings' advising against it. It is a true test of humanity and strength. Our protagonist is really perfectly cut for the job and delivers a believable action path all throughout the movie.The sounds scape is amazing. All the scenery looks great. The acting is wonderful (british-ish?) and the lead role is nothing less than imprinted in my brain for all of my life.As a negative, the CGI looks terrible and really pulled me out of immersion. The puppets are great thou. I give this 8/10 as it is really one of the classics in the genre.It is a take on Alien leaning more towards horror but mostly focusing on humanity. I would say this is the movie which explored the actual setting of the universe once the Aliens came into the picture , following the original movie but taking it in a more dystopian direction. Just as I like it.As mentioned, the middle does slow down a bit and I lost focus for a while but it soon picks up again and the end really makes up for all of it. This is one of the classics and will remain so for a long time to come.",8,4,4,9 April 2018
Ghostbusters," A full experience
","Oh, childhood, seeing Ghostbusters for the first time, it tickled my imagination. Seeing it again in my thirties I must say the experience was a bit different. Of course the obvious great acting performances were more apparent this time around. Bill Murray is a lot more of a 'dog' than I remember, being weighed perfectly by the co-actors who all have their own personalities which help to advance the story.The plot... its quite simple really. Quickly moving to the core, Ghost Busting, moving ahead fast enough to keep the audience engaged while ticking all the usual boxes of love interest, comedy and villains. The chemistry between the lead actors feels natural and having Sigourney Weaver gives the possession part of the movie more weight. What I really took away from the movie was what I miss in most movies these days. Great characters, good balance of action and dialogue as well as genuine fun on the actors part . This is a fun movie which gave me a few chuckles and felt like it was really invested in, both in terms of budget (the special effects are a bit dated) and the apparent enjoyment of the actors.Honorable mention. Bill Murray gives his hallmark performance and in my opinion is the pivot of the movie without being overbearing. Sigourney Weaver is strong also.The music is 80's flashback which highlighted the the happy-go-lucky feeling of the movie. What I will say is the the music was implying a sense of mystery or even horror at a few places which to me didn't work at all. There is very little suspense in the movie and even when the score tries to work up a mood of mystery it kind of fell flat for me. Its a comedy with a supernatural context and that's it. Granted, it does it damn well.",8,2,2,8 April 2018
