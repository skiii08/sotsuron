Black Swan," it's OK.
","This is a decent enough movie, really well produced and shot, with washed out colour scheme to set the tone for a dark, cerebral plot.The acting is also superb, in my opinion, come to think about it.That said, I wouldn't say it's a classic, which I was expecting given some of the reviews up here. By the 25th or so minute you know pretty much exactly what's going on: the protégé feeling the pressure...mental afflictions ...reality becoming mixed with make believe..etc etc.Machinist...Vanilla Sky/Los Ojos anyone? Both excellent and masters of the genre to my mind.But go see it anyway and make your own mind up.",6,0,1,30 January 2011
