The Ring," One gigantic bubble that got bursted in the end for good
","The Ring had a interesting plot concept, a video tape that gets its viewers killed. Believable? No. Scary? Yes. The film is very thrilling from the beginning to the end. It starts as a young girl realizes that she had seen it exactly a week ago. After some really scary scenes she is dead and her aunt, a reporter starts to investigate this mystery and ends up seeing the tape herself. And her ex-boyfriend and son too. So the clock is ticking for them to solve what is behind it or they'll end up dead too. The suspense keeps the viewer in its grasp all the way trough the film, but...It seems that the writer ran out of ideas how to end this and how to give a reasonable explanation for the tape's magic powers. The ending simply sucked. The suspense that the film built bursted like a bubble and makes you laugh. Might have passed as an episode of X-Files but a feature film, no. 4/10 for a good attempt and the scary parts.",4,0,1,7 March 2003
Pearl Harbor," I went to see a war film...
","Spoiler alert.I went to see a war film about bombing the Pearl Harbor like I went to see Saving Private Ryan for Normandy invasion but I got a too long, too boring love story. Piece of crap. Two long hours we wait as those two pilot-guys love the same girl. What does that do in a war movie? At least the battle is well made and I could watch that part again. Zeros flying ten meters above ground and blasting with machine guns and bombs. I think that the Doolittle raid was put there so the ending would not be too sad for the American audience. My advice: Wait until this thing comes out on DVD and jump the first two hours. You miss nothing.",3,0,0,30 June 2001
The Truman Show," Great
","Not a typical stupid Carrey comedy where you watch that 'funny-guy' making not-funny things. More serious film, but not boring in any way. It is very enjoying to watch. Great script and story and very good soundtrack. And Ed Harris plays great role as Cristof.",9,0,0,15 May 2001
Thirteen Days," good, but too long.
","The film is about Cuban missile crisis that everyone has heard about during history lessons. Film shows what was happening in white house during the crisis. Even if the film is basically meetings in cabinets, it still was interesting to watch. Although there were a few well made scenes of recon planes flying over Cuba. There are two stupid things in the movie. First is the stupid accent of Costner. And the other was the length. I was getting little tired in the end and started to wait for the ending. Since this was basically meetings, and talking it was 30 minutes or so too long.",8,0,1,3 March 2001
