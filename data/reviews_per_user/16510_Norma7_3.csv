Catch Me If You Can," Haven't Seen it Yet, but......
","I intend to see it.  However,  as one writer states, the story was told in the film 'The Great Imposter' with Tony Curtis.  I believe this is based on another man's adventures, so I guess two people pulled this stunt and got away with it for a while!",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
Gone with the Wind," A Truly Great Movie
","I have read the book three times, and seen the movie four times. It is a great movie, but I really liked the book better.I think Leslie Howard looks much too old to play Ashley;  he looks old enough to be Scarlett's father. I still loved the film.  It is one of the greatest ever made.  A great story.",9,1,2,24 October 2002
Mr. Holland's Opus," Very good, but not Great!
","After seeing Mr. Holland's Opus,  I was very favorably impressed with the film (all except it was a little long).Then, on second thought,  I have decided some flaws exist that keep it from being a truly great film.1.  Mr. Holland was a little too self-centered.  He was more interested in his career than he was in his son.  His son should have been his top priority.2.  I did not like the part of the film where it was obvious that he was wishing that he could leave on the bus.  I will not go into this, in order to avoid a spoiler.  Those who have seen the film will know what I mean.It was still a more enjoyable film than most that Hollywood makes.  I give it a 7, out of a possible 10.",Null,1,4,7 September 2002
