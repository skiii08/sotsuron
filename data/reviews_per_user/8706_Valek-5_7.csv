The Devil's Advocate," Good comments for brilliant film
","This is the classic 90's horror movie.  I saw it when it first came out, and then again on video.  Unfortunately when watching it on video it loses part of it's effect.  It is still REALLY good, but it just had that extra something on the big screen.",9,1,1,28 June 1999
Wayne's World," Brilliant comedy
","This film is one of the classics along the line of 'Bill and Ted's...'.  A true classic 'sequelled' by another.  This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  The amazing Chris Farley along with Tia Carrere, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are a winning combination.I think that the humour in this film is from the fact that this film is supposed to take place in every day life, so the things that happen in this film, COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!!!This is a true comedy.  I suggest you watch it.  NOW!",8,1,2,15 November 1999
The Shining," Brilliant portrayal by Jack Nicholson
",I recently saw the movie and thought it was brilliant.  Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance was brilliant.  I have also seen the 1997 version of the film which was actually made for TV but was later adapted to film. I think that the 'graphicalness' of it is quite a bit better and has more of an effect as a horror film.  I recommend seeing the 1997 version as well as this one.,8,0,0,14 September 1999
Kelly's Heroes," Kelly's Heroes a gem!
",When I first saw the movie I thought it was going to be a really serious film.  It was actually REALLY brilliant!  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  It is an amazing movie with a lot of laughs all the way through. Oddball (Sutherland) and Kelly (Eastwood) practically made the film what it was. DEFINATELY worth watching,8,2,3,28 June 1999
Army of Darkness," Cult Classic
","A true cult classic.  I don't know what makes a cult classic, but judging from this movie the list has to contain a shallow 2 dimensional main character, a completely unbelievable plotline and strange special effects.I thoroughly enjoyed this film as I do any B-grade movies (not that this IS one...).  Even the second and third time I watched it I enjoyed it.Here's a thought: How did the army of darkness (skeletons) run, talk, pick things up, shout, or for that matter, even move if they had NO muscles or internal organs whatsoever?",6,1,6,27 October 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Not as bad as you think
","I didn't vote on this movie because I wouldn't know what rating to give it. I was surprised at the number of lousy comments for this film.  I think the film was actually quite good.  I saw most people thought of it as a SNL (Saturday Night Live) spinoff, but the only thing that it has in common with SNL is the fact that there are 2 humorous people in it.This film about 2 eccentricly close brothers (who AREN'T gay) who are just trying to be cool and fit in with the almost unobtainable upper class of clubbers is a must for all die-hard 80's people out there.This film isn't as bad as most people think.  If I were looking to rent a movie, I would definately give this one a try.",6,1,2,27 October 1999
The Matrix," Most AMAZING film EVER
","The Matrix HAS to be the best movie of 1999.  No question about it.  I have seen the movie 3 times and never got tired of it.  In fact it keeps getting better every time you see it.  If any of you out there haven't seen it, GO NOW!  SEE IT!!I would recommend this movie to EVERYONE.Who knows, maybe what the movie says is true...",10,0,0,28 June 1999
