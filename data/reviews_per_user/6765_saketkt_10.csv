The Lobster," A Utopian dystopian setting with inception like ending.
","Premise: The world is a better place if everyone lives as a couple. There is no place for an individual (loner). Setting: A loner is sent to a hotel, where he is supposed to find a partner within 45 days else he/she is turned into an animal of his/her choice. If he/she escapes they are ousted from the hotel and hunted. So there is no place for a loner.The movie has two phases, both dystopia ,amidst a setting of Utopian world around them. Colin Farrell has done a brilliant job of portraying a loner who struggles in such a society. This is a lesson that nothing can ever be perfect- that is no society however hard it tries. His choice of animal was a Lobster. But he did not want to be transformed into one. So the struggle begins. The movie starts of by showing different types of people and the mundane activities that always follow them around. It is like familiarizing yourself in this new world. Weird at first, but you will enjoy it later. There is also this narration by Rachel Weisz which helps. Farrell, by portraying himself to be similar, marries a cold hard murderer in desperation as he runs out of days. But his intention is discovered when his wife kicks his brother dog to death. He, with the help of a hotel maid, transforms his wife and escapes to the loners living in the forest. In what animal was she transformed is not shown. But I guess it would be a dog, and he probably kicked it to death.To his surprise, he finds a world similar to the one at the hotel. It is just the whole thing is opposite, that is no partners allowed. But he falls in love with Rachel Weisz. He falls in love where he is not suppose to and does not fall in love where he is suppose to. Such is the contradictory nature of humans. The evil woman, who is their leader, discovers their intention and blinds Rachel Weisz to dissuade them from running away. But as always the protagonist overcomes his challenge, and they escape to the city to live as a couple. One notion of this movie is that similar natured people are suppose to be a couple. So now that Weisz was blind, Farrell too had to be blind. The movie ends at this point leaving its audience wondering whether they got together or not.Definitely, an avant garde. Deserves an applause. Something different from the most, and one should watch this just because it is a new experience. The pace is slow, but acting and direction makes up for it.",6,1,7,18 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight deserves an 8. And the letter's not real man.
","What's not there to like in a Tarantino movie? I found the movie hilarious, not joking. Samuel L. Jackson was awesome. Even the sheriff was hilarious in the last scene. There is not much visual aesthetics in most of Tarantino's films. Around eighty percent of the movie is shot in a cabin. By no means that's bad. It's just the characters, the way Tarantino usually develops them, and the dialogs that make his movies so damn good. Besides, details; anecdotes; and metaphors are plenty in this one. I love the way Tarantino's characters use stories to get their point across. It's like Bamn! You hit the sweet spot. The Hateful 8 was no different, though the music score was disappointing. Also, the pace dropped mid way, but it picked up later on.This movie is about six bounty hunter, a horse carriage driver, and a sheriff (I am not sure-was he a bounty hunter too?) stuck in a cabin due to a blizzard in a tale of twist and turns. Kurt Russel is transferring a bounty to a town to hang her. On his way, the company picks up Samuel L Jackson, and the sheriff. Following their arrival, Samuel L. Jackson senses something's a misplace. The company encounters four other men waiting already in the cabin. It includes an actual hangman, an old retired southern black hating general, a Mexican acting as a caretaker at Minnie's, and a Joe Cage traveling to meet his mother. Pretty Company. There is a traitor(s) among them who conspire(s) to free the bounty. Samuel L. Jackson slowly unravels the mystery and springs the trap that the earlier company had just walked into. Yeah, obviously he met someone unexpected, and he ends up losing something precious. I love the way he screams- here and in Django Unchained too.IMDb should add comedy to the already listed genres -drama, thriller, mystery-of this movie. Just enjoy the movie, and Tarantino fans don't be too critical.",8,4,21,24 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," Stands out tall among the big names this winter.
","Bridge of SpiesWhat a delightfully wonderful movie! Tom Hanks, you are the best. For the past two days, I watched a lot of movies; they included some big names such as Sicario, The Martian, The Revenant, Creed, and The Hateful 8. No disrespect to any of those titles- they were all good- but surprisingly Bridge of Spies stood out. In fact I was least thrilled to watch it. So what is it that makes a movie stand out? Why was Bridge of Spies so good? The sheer delight and joy, during and after watching, of a beautiful cinema; the moment you say 'Wow! that was good' after the movie ends; and the picture of Tom Hanks lingering in your head long after the movie is over. You know that the movie was good.Keeping all these in mind, I decided to check its ratings. Guess what? In high sevens, that is low, and it is further going to go down- maybe stabilize around mid way. But I thought that it really deserved an eight.Obviously, there are some questions which I had? Why did not Tom Hanks research his client? Defending a guilty and getting him acquitted is a greater crime. We knew Abel was a spy, but Donovan did not. So did Abel confide to Donovan about him being a spy? If so, shouldn't he not defend Abel or help the government- FBIs,CIAs? Or was he just fighting on humanitarian grounds? Did he feel the treatment given to Abel was not apt, but then who was he to decide? Further, did Abel play with Donovan with his story? Was it brilliant on part of Abel to take a shot in dark making him the real puppeteer? Further, was Donovan so a strict follower of rules- attorney client privileges, even if Abel told Donovan the truth-that he was ready to betray his country? In short was Donovan a traitor? I find all these aspects of the movie fascinating, and looking forward to further deliberation.The dialogs were crisp and beautifully written. One of my favorite scene is the first conversation between Donovan and Russian spy posing as a secretary in Soviet embassy in East Germany. Another was the contrast between composure of an agent and that of Donovan during exchange.I recommend-A Must Watch.",8,1,3,23 December 2015
The Intouchables," The Intouchables- Where was this movie until now?
","Who is the untouchable? Is the sick man or is it Driss? I think both. One has a repulsive sickness and the other is a thug, outcast. It is subjective. You have to watch it to decide. Untouchable is a beautiful movie. I speak English, but i watched it with French subtitle. I don't say this often, but I enjoyed it very much. Where was this movie until now? The starting scene is intense. The camera is close up on two people sitting in a BMW, looking indifferently at the Paris night lights. The driver, Driss, suddenly breaks a traffic signal and violates speed limits. The police is hot on their trail. All this time, the other guy sitting beside Driss, Phillip, is indifferent. Out of the blue, Driss bets Phillip that he can lose the cops. So the chase begins. But Driss gets cutoff by a police car just when he thought he had lost the cars on their trail. Now things starts to get interesting. I had not read any article about this movie. I had no idea what was about to come. Phillip could not walk, but still he helps Driss win the bet. Now the movie goes in flashback where life of Phillip and Driss is revealed and how they came across each other.Philip is leper neck down. Not leper exactly, but he can't feel a thing. He is rich and he is interviewing people for position of a nurse. In this atypical scene, Driss with his hood and a jacket over it stands out. He is not there for the job- he knows he is not getting it. He wants a rejection letter so that he can get benefit. Waiting in queue, Driss loses patience and barges in Philip's cabin requesting him to sign. But, as you will see, Driss and Phillip hit it off. Both are poles apart. But still a spark is there, and it is there throughout. I think the chemistry between them is the soul of the movie. You never want it to end. You are scared that it might end. It is this dual feeling that will keep you on the edge-beautifully balanced. This movie evokes different emotions. For instance, pity- see Philip struggling, love- a different sort between two men; humor- between Driss and secretary, between Driss and Phillip, the shaving scene; frustration- why is Driss leaving Phillip. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I think a very few movie can do such. And emotions transcends all boundaries. Audiences are able to connect, unlike most of the movies. And this connection puts the movie right up there with the best. Another movie that comes in this category is Shawshank.I recommend - A must must watch. A beautiful movie. Hat off to the full crew.",9,0,0,24 January 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War. A dream come true for superhero movie lovers.
","I watched it yesterday, and I want to watch it again today. For how many movies can someone say this? Very few. That's how good the movie is. DC will have to buckle up if it wants to compete with Marvel. Batman vs Superman :(The action scenes are bloody awesome. I love the Black Panther. I did not expect it to be so damn close to the real thing.Check out Winter Soldier vs Black Panther. Some of angles at which the shield is thrown by Captain is out of this world. Scarlet Witch is powerful. I thought no one could control Vision. One chase scene was whoohoo -running out of adjectives. Black Panther after Winter soldier, and Captain after both. Spidy is pretty good too- especially with his lines (linees)With such a large crew of superheroes, things could have gone wrong. But it turned out otherwise. The movie picks up from the Sokovia incident, and Captain tracking his best buddy. There is a parallel plot to destroy Avengers in which Bucky is a pawn. The plot almost succeeds with the formation of two teams- Team America vs Team Iron Man. The two teams fighting with each other is just epic- Spidy with his lines, Ant man with his ANTics, a true Black Widow, Hawkeye who never misses etc etc. Among all this chaos, the real fight lies somewhere else and a truth is learned that changes the dynamics of Avengers forever. Hard to find faults.A must watch. Waiting for the next movie in line.",8,9,18,12 May 2016
Black Panther," Epic Buildup to the Infinity Stone movie
","Marvel took a huge risk with black panther just before the release of The Infinity Wars. With a complete different tone as compared to other
marvel movies, the risk may not have paid off and it could have affected the frenzy around the final two movies with box office not performing
as expected. But, the movie turned out to be brilliant and Marvel continues to outperform DC on all levels (JL was a disappointment).
I think Marvel's formula for success is to have atleast a decent story line, like the trunk of a tree, rather than going all bang bang with
expensive grpahics. Then characters are introduced and developed just like branches of a tree over time. There are as many as nine diverse characters and
all of them are given sufficient screen time. The setting is similar to background where the tree (analogy) is growing. The set here is Wakanda.
The designers have done a marvellous job with the city, costume, and make up. The soundtracks bring an element of Africa beautifully binding Wakanda
and the characters. The dialogues are decent with tinge of humour and smartass lines.
Black panther (without revealing any spoilers) is a story of a prince who rights the wrong of his father in light of his death. TChaka created
the monster killmonger due to differences in ideology with his cousin. Klaue is another interesting character who smuggles vibranium out of Wakanda
and is responsible for death of Tchaka and other tribe leaders. TChalla is looking to avenge his father's death when he encounters Killmonger and loses
control over Wakanda in a straight duel to the throne with him. With help from Jabari tribe, Nakia, and Shuri; TChalla manages to defeat Killmonger and
brings about few changes for the first time as a ruler of Wakanda.
Now, coming to the ratings of the movie, there are five parameters on which I score movie out of ten. These are story (1), acting (1.5), aesthetics (2),
editing/narrating (1.5), Xfactor/uniqueness/fun (1.3) which totals to 7.3/10. My reccommendation is MUST WATCH.
I like to end my reviews by describing my favourite scene of the movie. Mine is- the car chase scene in which Klaue tries to escape and TChalla 
dismantles vehicles like toys by jumping over them and removing wheels with one hand.",7,3,8,19 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," JJ Abrams needs awakening, not the force
","Only JJ Abrams can make a light saber fight scene look sh**. With the tech available now days, you can do amazing fight scenes. I loved the light saber- the close up vibrations, the intense subtle flaring around edges, and the noise accompanying it were good. But look who is holding it. A little-thin man, Kylo Ren, for whom the light saber is too big. And what does he use his light saber mostly for? Destroying ship controls. His voice is impressive ,though.I missed the starting scene. Damn the traffic.I saw it when Rey pops into the frame with her face covered. This frame is in trailer too. JJ Abram is a good story teller. He develops character well. And that is exactly what he did with Rey. Depicting her life at Jakku, throwing a moral dilemma here and there. Take Finn also. And first half survives just because of this. The pace starts to drop midway. JJ Abrams tries to be cheeky and funny. I don't know about funny ,but dialogs were cheeky. All the time, it felt as if the movie is missing something. Besides, I am not a fan of old Harrison Ford and Princess Leia.Here's the summary: some plans stolen from enemy by Rebels. One person from light and dark side crossover. Finn and Ren. Ren hunts and destroys all in search of the plans. Some truths are learned along the way, and there is a deadly weapon that needs to be destroyed. Rey, the main protagonist, with help from rebel friends win the day. Luke Skywalker pops in at last because another movie can be made in future.Reading all the commentaries before watching it raised my expectation from the force awakens. Almost everywhere it said ,this is the best of the seven films. How wrong they were and not for the first or last time? I am sure many of star wars universe fans feel the same way. In my reviews, I always mention my favorite scene. Thinking about it, it would be the fighter,Poe who was captured and tortured at the beginning, rescuing people on some planet, forgot the name, and Finn cheering him. This sums it up.",6,13,19,23 January 2016
Deadpool," Captain Deadpool..No, it's just Funny, DeadFunny.
","Why can't Deadpool get plastic surgery? It will solve his problem- normal face with super human abilities. In addition, he doesn't have to fight the bad guy; He can remain dead, get his girl, and live happily thereafter. But then there will be no Deadpool movie.Ryan Reynolds killed the movie. I don't think anyone can do a better job than him. The role comes naturally to him.The script is well written, and delivered even better. Soundtrack and songs are awesome. The idea of going back in past from time to time to tell the story doesn't make the movie monotonous. Well timed dialogs and some amazing action scenes make the movie enjoyable to watch.There is not much to the plot. The trailer pretty much sums it up.The car chase and bullet countdown scene are amazing. Add funny Ryan Reynolds to that. There is no shortage of jokes. The opening credits is different; And RR doesn't even spare the studio. Deadpool's friends, Negasonic Teenage Warhead; Dopinder; The Old Lady; and The BarGuy, compliment him well. My favourite scene is the trio walking to rescue the damsel in distress with DMX playing in the background score. Definitely a must watch.",7,1,9,12 February 2016
Spectre," Just Another Bond Movie.
","I don't know why they are still making Bond movies. It seems script writers have ran out of ideas. The plot was one dimensional-linear; one thing pointing at another in succession. It felt as if Spectre was excruciatingly squeezed out of last few Bond films just like you try to get that extra oil, when there is none left in the oil well. Casino Royale was one of my favorite movies, and Daniel Craig rocked it. Similarly, he did a good job in this one too. I think he is the best Bond till date.The movie starts off with a high action packed chase. This has been a recent trend in Bond movies. These starting sequences are linked to a sinister organization planning to take over the world. Amidst all these, Bond finds a clue which links him to another location and another high action packed sequence. In this case he finds a ring with an octopus carving, similar to the ring in Lord of Rings, not with the powers, though. Given Bond's rebellion nature, he is placed under surveillance after causing havoc at the start. Meanwhile the secret services are going through an organizational shift. In between Bond takes help from his friends at the services, and has fun with hot chicks. Throw in some gadgets-luckily depression in over.Then he meets an assassin, who has a beautiful daughter, from past who worked for this sinister organization. He points him to his daughter, they fall in love, who furthers points him to another clue, and they find coordinates of the bad guy. As usual, the bad guy tortures the protagonist, but Bond has a trick under his sleeve. He escapes with his girl, but the bad guys don't die that easily. The bad guy is Christopher Waltz. Also, there is history between Waltz and Craig. The bad guy takes a last hit at Bond, he fails, and then there is a lovely kissing scene at the end.As I stated earlier, the plot is linear. Don't expect turns and twists. The action scenes are damn good. These make the movie worthwhile watching. The starting sequence, the chase in Aston Martin with Batista, and the glider scene at snow capped mountains in Austria are all equally good. The movie has a sharp editing, direction, and cinematography. The starting song along with the title and opening credit is exquisite.I recommend- a one time watch.",7,0,2,27 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge
","Lately, I had some free time, and I decided to spent it in my old way- binge watching. Hacksaw was on my list from the moment I saw the trailer. Add to it, I read good reviews in a daily. Andrew Garfield has a smirk on his face, that is annoying, during the entire length of the movie. The movie is about a man who has this personal code of his. He wont fight, he wont do wrong, he wont hold a gun. Two incidents portrayed in this movie shaped him to be as he is today. With an attitude like that, Garfield is an outcast. He is different. America enters into war. Having a father who was a veteran in the war, Garfield should expect some cajoling to not join the army. But the euphoria gets him. He wants to serve. But he does not want to break his code. So he decides to enroll and serve as a medic. His visits to hospital fascinated him and yes he found Palmer. Garfield and his values make him an aberration. Nobody likes aberration. He is given tough time in training. Although sound, an army unit needs each and every member to follow orders and act consistently. It is as strong as its weakest member. But then again diversity does some good. It helps you think. Garfield is thrown into war, without his gun. He runs around battlefield saving soldiers in scores. He has his bible with a photo of beautiful Palmer which is a source of constant motivation and reminder to do good and get back home safely- not sure about the last part. Garfield is the first person to receive medal of honor without lifting a gun. It definitely motivates people to follow their heart. The problem comes when you think too much.Overall, it is a good movie. It was not boring. The war scenes are well shot and choreographed. And you have Vince Vaughan! A few scenes do send goosebumps....so i will recommend a watch.My favorite moment is clichÃ©d, and it is the lowering of injured soldiers from the ridge by Garfield in face of grave danger-one man army. Reminds me of Rambo.",7,2,4,3 March 2017
