Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst episode ever.
","This was, quite possibly, the worst film I have ever seen.We could start with the poor script.  Or the bad acting.  Or maybe the inorganic special effects.But I won't waste your time with any of these things.  They've been argued to death.  I'll just say that this movie was pure and utter garbage.",Null,0,1,4 April 2000
Snatch," Brilliance amidst a sea of flotsam.
","There have been a small handfull of watchable films in the past twelve months.  This is one of them.Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) does it again with this tour-de-force heist flick taking cues from Darren Aronofsky and Quentin Tarantino while building off them instead of merely ripping them off.If Quentin Tarantino had made more than one film in the past seven years (he hasn't) then we may never have even heard of Guy Ritchie.  But I'm glad we have.  He's one of the most visually inventive filmmakers of the past fifteen years and it's nice to see something original and creative instead of drek like Traffic and Castaway.",10,1,2,19 January 2001
The Village," M. Night fails yet again.
","I shouldn't be able to figure out the 'twist' of the film in the first eight minutes, then spend the next two hours bored by shoddy filmmaking.  No one at the theater I saw this at seemed even remotely surprised by the big ending.The same was true of Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs.  The man is a hack.  And what's with the self-important director cameos anyway?  Does this man actually think he's Hitchcock?M. Night claims that he's discovered the formula for a blockbuster success. That may be true.  But when was the last time a big blockbuster was actually any good?0 for 4 and I'm done seeing this man's movies.",1,4,7,2 August 2004
