Mission: Impossible III," Better than the first 2
","Although I'd consider myself a minor fan of the jolt-action genre, the Mission: Impossible series have always had some sort of affect on me. I'll admit that the second part was not that great, I had to watch the third since JJ Abrams was the director. Being a typical 'Lost' fan, I was actually quite impressed with Mission: Impossible III.Paying homage to the genius that is 'Lost,' JJ Abrams found a way to not only team up with his 'Alias' partner to write the screenplay, but also throw constant action in our face that not only had us on the edge of our seats but intricately wove together a more deep encounter that made me always wonder: What next! Mission: Impossible III explores the never ending work of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) who now has to face a much more villainous weapons provider super-creepy antagonist (Seymour Hoffman). Althuogh this time around, Ethan has to protect his identity not only from the whole world but also from the closest thing to him: his girlfriend.I was expecting yet another eye-candy, in-your-face, 'edge of the seat' thriller, but what I got was a roller-coaster ride that just seemed to never slow down! Tom Cruise delivers an actually very good performance, as a daring super-spy who undergoes an impossible task, risking not only his and his partners' lives, but also his fiancé's. Almost each scene in the movie jets out a nerve wracking frenzy, this isn't your typical car exploding, plane chasing, run for your life movie, and though all of those things are present, Abrams finds a way to have multiple things happening in one scene. When Ethan and his team attempts to escape the chasing plane at the beginning of the movie, the hostage (Russell) screams in agony while an explosive chip is implanted in her head, and as the plane is crashing into this never-ending thrill ride, we see that there is humanity in the characters.The movie is pretty complex and you have to pay close attention to follow through. Even with Cruise's inability to follow his mission due to personal problems, we see the drive in his character and the undertone of trust that occurs throughout.The movie is definitely a 'pop-corn' flick, but I'd say it's much more than that. I'd say to some extent, M:I3 is an extremely fun, complex, beautifully directed movie.Kudos Abrams!",7,0,0,16 May 2006
United 93," Realistic and powerful.
","The attack on September 11 which we all know about is yet again recorded in this tragic docudrama about the fourth hijacked plane -- and the only one to not reach its target. With almost limitless realism, United 93 fills you up with such emotion that you can't help but feel like you're experiencing the events.Inspired by Gus Van Sant's movie Elephant, director-writer Paul Greengrass silences any attempt to commercialize this movie and portrays the events on United Flight 93 like they were meant to be. This story fills us with anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, and shock as virtually unknown actors (some playing themselves) are shown watching as the terror rises in New York and Washington. Greengrass directs this movie in such a way that leaves you breathless. His hand-held swinging, shaky camera comes right into the action and portrays every real emotion that the people on United 93 would have had.Never in my life have I seen such a powerful, and realistic portrayal of an actual event, making the movie almost too hard to watch. And although you want to look away, and though you know the inevitable will happen, Greengrass manages to convince you that there is hope. The characters show both human emotion and forced emotion (the four Terrorists hiding their fear and pushing themselves towards death). As the movie switches back and fourth between flight 93 and the flight control room, we are exposed to dialog documented from actual conversations and transcripts from September 11.The movie stays true to the events without going overboard, and truly focuses on the humanity, the inevitable tragedy that we all hadn't see coming. The audience feels almost motionless as United 93 comes to a closing, throwing the characters into countless near-death emotions, swinging the camera back and fourth as if it was really happening. What we now would call a painful day, America never saw coming ('A hijacking? Yeah right!').United 93 really inspired me both artistically and emotionally. More complicated than it looks, Greengrass presented to us a raw and truly unbelievable film that examines real-life horror. This is definitely a movie to remember, and one that in my opinion truly deserves recognition.",10,1,2,7 June 2006
Chinatown," An unforgettable masterpiece
","Though in my opinion 'Chinatown' deserved both director and picture Oscars over 'Godfather II,' the movie still remains one of the most memorable and cinematic movies ever created. Director Roman Polanski (who makes a cameo in the movie as a short mobster who cuts Jack Nicholson's nose) creates a film noir so tense and so brilliant, that it makes any 70s detective drama pale in comparison. 'Chinatown' paved way for a tremendous respect for Roman Polanski, Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson.The movie takes place in the 1940s where detectives and private investigators were the biggest thing. Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes (pronounced Git-teas) who takes on a job for a woman by the name of Mrs. Mulwray. The job is to find out if her husband is cheating on her. As Gittes spies on her husband he soon realizes that there is much more to the story than just an affair as he finds Mr. Mulwray dead and Mrs. Mulwray is not really his wife. Faye Dunaway shows up as Mr. Mulwray's real wife, Evelyn Mulwray, in one of the best femme fatale characters ever put on the screen. Gittes soon finds himself in a mayhem of murder, betrayal, incest, and greed while uncovering Mr. Mulwray's suspicious death in a backtrack of a place in Los Angeles called Chinatown.Roman Polanski beautifully directs this film to portray the character of Gittes as both ambitious, charming and unafraid. He designs an ongoing feud between the law and criminals to show the life in the '40s. Showing just how brilliantly creepy a storyline can turn out, Polanski sways us into a subtle affair of wrongdoings by carefully illustrating a step-by-step process of a film noir terror. He chooses a brilliant score for the film that helps us feel both the 1940s and the '70s film noir. The cinematography is also great. Each scene is lit with subtle coloring, making it both cinematic and dark.'Chinatown' represents a typical classic film noir at its finest. Every minute of the movie keeps you in complete suspense and challenges your values and ideas about society. More than just a detective story, 'Chinatown' digs deep into the political and social agenda and picks out what seems to be a masterpiece.",10,4,10,19 June 2006
Closer," One of the all-time Best Screenplays!
","I was surprised to see this incredible movie snubbed at the Oscars for a couple of awards, bit I digress.Not often is it that the public gets a chance to see a movie with such relevance, such beauty and insight, such genius dialogue masterfully portrayed by some amazing actors.The story focuses on 4 individuals in London who are in love with the idea of love. Though their individual dependence on one another brings them closer, their insecurity breaks them apart. Anna (Julia Roberts), Alice (Natalie Portman), Dan (Jude Law), and Larry (Clive Owen) each lust for strangers, thus having jobs that usually brings strangers 'closer.' To borrow a tag-line from the movie, 'If you believe in love... Take a closer look,' this film sucks you into a non-existing world that so closely both reflects and fictionalizes our society. Though some may say it lacks any realism, anyone who's lived in a large city on their own knows that the film pays homage and respect to their experience.Brilliantly captured by one of the best directors of all time, Mike Nichols, it presents true messages and themes of passion, anger, jealousy, and of course love.If you have never seen this movie I suggest you pick up a copy immediately. And hey, if you've seen it once already, see it again, I guarantee you'll pick up stuff you couldn't the first time you viewed it. The complex screenplay is worth examining thoroughly.Definitely one of the best movies of all time. Ten stars!",10,2,4,24 March 2006
American Beauty," Deliciously raw!
","The ironic thing about 'American Beauty' is that no matter how many times you see it, you still don't quite comprehend the massive beauty of the movie itself. However, throw in a couple of amazing actors, writer Alan Ball, director Sam Mendes, and mix it in with complete originality, and the result is an excruciatingly complex and deep movie.The story starts off with Lester talking about your 'regular' 40-something year-old mid-life crisis life, and reminds the audience the he will be dead in less than a year. From the moment the narration from Kevin Spacey is initiated, we are juggled into a realistic world of self-pity, lust, betrayal, narcissism, and controversial subject matter. The following 100-something minutes leave us breathless as our imagination grabs hold of the tragedy that is life, and doesn't let go until we realize 'American Beauty' is nothing but a metaphor for the life that surrounds us.The surreal juxtaposition of the characters foreshadows an ever-growing feud between families, friends and even colleagues. Carolyn (Bening) loathes the thought of being an average housewife, while their daughter Jane (Birch) accepts the idea of being 'ordinary' and moves on with life. Each character is flawed and never either overpowers or seems inferior to another character, which is so strongly a reflection of the real life. The rest of the cast is unique and quirky but just enough to show that not everyone is perfect. Angela - portrayed by the brilliant Mena Suvari - gives off the impression that she is loved and looked up at while never facing the reality that she pales in comparison to the beauty that is life.The movie focuses more on Lester (Spacey) and how he comes to terms with his own identity, and lives life to the fullest. What he fails to realize is that nothing can be that easy, and no one stays young and has fun forever. The dialogue in the movie is perfect. It fits the realistic feel while inspiring the audience and constantly flowing the thoughts of the characters.To be honest, 'American Beauty' charges us with such insight, such depth and such honesty that we just cannot ignore. The inspiring screenplay magnificently captures each and every element a good movie should have and goes beyond the expectations.I have to say that 'American Beauty' is definitely genius. I saw it when it just came out and automatically I rented the VHS (I didn't have a DVD player then) and watched it over and over. Not only is it an original and thought-provoking drama, but you can watch it constantly without ever getting bored.",10,0,2,18 May 2006
Saving Private Ryan," The perfect war movie..
","'Saving Private Ryan' is one of those movies you can't believe didn't win the picture Oscar. That didn't stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions. The movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen. The attack on D-Day is immensely powerful and painfully well directed. Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and action-driven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of war.The movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's the last of four brothers still left alive. After the attack of D-Day most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole war-zone. Back at home, Ryan's mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war, and begs the soldiers to find her last one.It's a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be. Vicious, disgusting, violent, heartbreaking, unfair, and tragic. Spielberg's use of the hand-held camera is almost breathtaking, as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic. His incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influential.Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance as Captain John Miller, a dedicated and loyal soldier who's on the verge of losing his mind. The pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture, trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiers.The story doesn't focus on the heroic aspect, but rather the truth about war. Spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters, they have a chance of dying. There is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private Ryan so they could go home.Definitely one of the best directed films in a long time, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a bright gem in recent film-making. Robbed of the Picture Oscar, the movie is a true representation of D-Day and post D-Day. It's a movie that inspires above all else.",9,14,26,25 July 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good for moviegoers but disappointing for comic fanatics!
","There's so much to say about a movie that has the biggest weekend opening in the history of cinema, especially one that has two predecessors and is based on the most popular Marvel comic book franchise. The first impression of X3: The Last Stand is a fairly good one. It starts off strong and creates much suspense, introduces new exciting characters and cleverly backtracks a few of the character's past lives. And although the movie is very fast-paced and incredibly cinematic, that's all the movie really has going for it.Had I walked into the theater being a small fan, or not a fan at all, of the X-Men comic books and TV show, I would have thoroughly been impressed. However, that was my big disadvantage; I already knew everything there is to know about X-men. The movie makes almost no attempt to pay homage to the original comic books. Yes, we have all the same characters and all the superheroes, but that's about it. Strange and shocking twists make the movie almost disappointing to any big X-men fan. And maybe the intention of the writer/director was to make X3 the very last movie, they left almost no room for a continuing storyline. Wouldn't we all be very shocked and disappointed if some crazy money grubbing freak made a Batman movie in which Batman himself dies? I know I'd be disappointed.But having said that, the movie makes up for what seems to be a disjointed plot. We're exposed to endless action and pretty interesting and strong special effects. For me to rate a movie high, it has to achieve something extraordinary. Once I sunk my mind into the movie and forgot that it's based on a comic book, I began to enjoy it. Enjoy? I really liked it! Countless incredibly action-packed scenes followed by surprisingly clever humor was enough for me to be entertained. Of course, seeing my favorite X-men character, Angel, come to life was incredible.The acting in the movie is mediocre at best. Even Sir Ian McKellen seems very stiff and uninspired as the vicious Magneto, while Halle Berry made me wonder why she ever won an Oscar. Hugh Jackman delivers a somewhat raw performance but quickly recovers when his more sentimental scenes are shown. The only performance worth writing about is that of Famke Janssen, who captures Jean (Phoenix) Gray and adds some fire to it. She enthusiastically portrays a creepy anti-hero and yet we still feel sympathetic. As she struggles between two 'worlds' she brilliantly sways us into different powerful emotions. The rest of the cast is quickly forgotten. Even Kelsey Grammar as Beast fails to convince us. There is almost nothing inspiring about the acting and absolutely no motivation is shown for their actions.Overall, X3: The Last Stand is your typical blockbuster flick. Once you learn to let go of the whole 'it doesn't stay true to the comic books' ideal, you realize that it's actually quite entertaining. Sometimes though it's hard to get rid of a grudge, and I'd say I'm being generous for giving the movie a 6/10, but I'm a huge fan of anything X-men and was quite impressed with the technical achievements of the movie. I guess when it comes down to it, if you're a regular moviegoer and can handle just about any kind of movie, you'll love it, but if you just cannot stand movies that go in the opposite direction from what the original story should be, then you may find yourself regretting you ever paid 12$ for it.",6,0,1,3 June 2006
Amadeus," Step aside! Make way for Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!
","What I'd thought would be just another biopic about somebody we all know turned out to be a deeply amazing piece of cinema. 'Amadeus' tells the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in a series of flashbacks told by the now insane rival composer Salieri (Abraham). As the story begins, we see that Salieri is now troubled by his past and in complete hostility towards Mozart, who was a far more talented musician than Salieri. In an attempt to ridicule Mozart, Salieri finds his music overwhelmingly beautiful and ironically inspirational, bringing out an even stronger rage towards the legend.Director Milos Forman proved yet again that he is one of the most talented directors. After his seemingly unbeatable masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', Forman creatively finds a way to adapt a fascinating play on to the screen in a flawless manner. The beautiful set design to the incredible make-up and costume design wows the audience and in every way possible makes them feel like they really are in that time period. The camera-work is brilliant, capturing key moments in a vastly visual way.Although the directing is painfully beautiful, the screenplay is without a doubt the best thing about the movie. Changing between time periods and geniusly keying in scenes together, 'Amadeus' goes beyond the expectations of film-making. Most of the scenes are edited so they fit in with the actual music of Mozart, which so wonderfully creates a powerful emotion almost unseen before.The acting is without a doubt superb. F. Murray Abraham as the psychotic Salieri shines in his Oscar-winning performance. His vision of Salieri's pain and suffering and resistance towards God is painfully depicted in both his portrayal of a jealous, hostile composer and an old psychotic washed out musician. Tom Hulce plays Mozart so brilliantly and so comically that you can't help but keep your eyes on him. His unforgettable laughter helps him join a much memorable list of performances in the history of cinema. Hulce portrays Amadeus creatively, both an immature playboy and a musical genius. He reportedly also had to learn to play the piano as well as Mozart's signature move: playing the piano upside down with his hands crossed. The rest of the cast also shines as they portray almost flawlessly the culture and society in the time of Mozart.'Amadeus' is a masterpiece. Everything from the screenplay, to the incredible set decoration and costume design is so vastly memorable and genius. The depth of the story is intense, creating a sense of madness and anger. Truly a movie to be seen more than just once, 'Amadeus' goes beyond film-making, showing us that movies can be made in the 18th century and still be entertaining.",10,1,3,22 June 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the creepiest films ever made.
","I don't think '2001: A Space Odyssey' should really be considered a film, but instead, it should be plain art. By 'plain' I don't mean boring or uninspiring. I call it 'plain art' because even to consider this genius work in the same category as other movies is risking comparison, and placing this movie beside another movie is almost unfair, because no movie has ever come close to being as unique.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is by far the most original piece of cinema ever created. It not only represents an idea so creepy and so realistic, but also breaks barriers in movie storytelling. Everything, from a 3-part narrative to an ending that makes you think for hours, wows the audience and sends their heads flying back in shock. It's a movie that a few may find weird, disjointed and pretentious, but every good movie is criticized by the public.The movie tells the story of a major transition between apes, humans and technology. Apes evolve into humans, and humans give birth to artificial intelligence. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, as an ape smashes bones and throws one up into the air, director Stanley Kubrick carefully crafts a flawless transition from a bone into a space ship. Kubrick then takes us through some creepy ideas about unexplainable events and technology taking over humanity. Though we see three different stories, they are all connected: the apes show the first sign of evolution into humanity as they become more aware of their surroundings and learn the nature of mystery. Then, fast-forwarding thousands of years later, we see the story of a spaceship traveling to the moon on a commercial craft, and as they arrive they are shocked to find a monolith, which then transitions into a couple of months later when a newer spaceship is traveling to Jupiter.Kubrick really shows his genius in this movie, as he both directs the movie and the special effects. For the year it was made, '2001: A Space Odyssey' completely shocked the audience with one of the most advanced and complex effects ever seen, which wows viewers even to this day. In an age where special effects were all done by hand, '2001: A Space Odyssey' makes many people skeptical as to how they achieved some of the scenes without computer help. Aside from the stellar special effects, the score is the most haunting and unique piece of music ever put on the big screen. It so closely fits in with the movie with some major key scenes.The movie plays like an opera. It sways the audience in an inspiring music frenzy while also focusing on a story. And as we watch this movie brought to life, we question our own faith and our own motives in terms of creating artificial intelligence and traveling to foreign planets. What if one day our own race creates a HAL 9000 (a supercomputer with the ability to think and feel)? Questions like this are very much discussed upon watching this terribly amazing movie.Stanley Kubrick's best direction and one of my top movies of all time. It makes any other movie about space travel or artificial intelligence look shameful. A perfect film and an inspiring piece of art, '2001: A Space Odyssey' defines cinema as one of the most influential and visually stunning films of all time.",10,10,19,15 June 2006
The Descent," One of the best horror flicks in the last few years.
","Like 'Open Water' and 'Blair Witch Project', this is a movie that holds more in its setting than it does in the fear factor. 'The Descent' isn't your typical screaming, jump-fest, it's a film that creates the situation more scary than the atmosphere. However, what makes a movie like this work is the constant feeling that something will in fact trigger that atmospheric feeling that every horror tries to manipulate onto the audience. And even though there are certain scenes that have you jump out of your seat, this is not an exercise in just how many surprises you can take. It's an exercise in how long you can have your hands squeezing the seat before it starts to hurt.It is a movie that centers around Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and her female friends who, every year, take a trip somewhere adventurous and explore. After Sarah's husband and child are tragically killed in a car accident, she suffers emotional pain but decides to bond again with her friends and do something fun to get her mind off of everything. This time, they decide to explore a deep cave. Of course, being a horror, the cave isn't really ordinary. In this cave, there are dead ends, rocks falling, bridges collapsing, deep holes, and-- oh yeah, mutated creatures. These deadly creatures hunger and without warning, eat the living flesh right off your body. Sarah and her friends must avoid all obstacles and reach the exit of the dark cave, before it's too late.Neil Marshall, previously famous for 'Dog Soldiers', creates a movie so intense, so teeth clenching, you have no choice but to feel tense. His use of space and camera angles creates an almost surreal claustrophobic feel. There you put yourself in the situation, and as you imagine yourself walking through a dark cave full of monsters, you get more terrified. Never before has a movie put me in such terror without even realizing it.In the day and age where horrors are all the same, and where they're only made for money, a horror fanatic needs some sort of reminder that there are some movies that still excite. Being a huge fan of the genre myself, it was a pleasant treat, and definitely a scary one. Call it being biased, call it too early, but 'The Descent' makes its way up into one of my favorite movies of the year.",10,5,11,24 August 2006
Some Like It Hot," Very funny!
","'Some Like it Hot' is the first of its kind. By that I mean that countless movies followed with the same plot: men can't do something being men so they dress up as women only to fall for a drop-dead gorgeous woman who just so happens to be really close with them. This movie however is the first to do this and does it in the best way possible.What's good about 'Some Like it Hot' is that it stays away from clichés and doesn't center around friendship and heartbreak, but moreso on the humor aspect of the movie. Almost every scene in the movie keeps you watching and throws you in a hysterical fit. It's a movie that shouldn't be over-analyzed, and should be watched solely for entertainment.Jack Lemon is brilliant in his Oscar-nominated performance as the witty and eccentric Dephne, and plays his character with such convincing mannerism that we tend to forget it's actually a man. In one hilarious and unforgettable scene, 'Daphne' convinces himself he's a woman by telling Joe 'Josephine' (Tony Curtis) that he's never been happier because a millionaire proposed to him. It is both comical and original, showing that you can only pretend to be someone for so long.Marilyn Manroe co-stars as Sugar, a sexy and beautiful alcoholic musician who falls for Joe's third identity, Junior. This creates an even more comic-genius plot, having countless identities running around trying to stay in character. It definitely defines comedy brilliance.The whole concept of the story of 'Some Like it Hot' is complete comic material. This movie allowed the three main actors to really reach out and play around with their roles and to have fun while doing it. It's not often that a movie features a lot of improvisation in order for the character to feel both real and staged.Influencing countless movies, comedies and romantic dramas alike, 'Some Like it Hot' still stands as one of the best comedies of all time. And for a good reason.",7,2,5,27 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Fun and entertaining!
","The movie adaptation of the Dan Brown novel 'The Da Vinci Code' isn't your typical summer blockbuster thriller hit. The interesting thing about it is that even though it's not as good as the novel, the movie still finds that key audience and brings it home. I didn't expect much more than a fun edge of your seat pop corn flick, and that's why I wasn't entirely disappointed.The movie pretty much follows the book dead on. It starts up with a death and an opening to a much larger mystery. The only thing I found a minor flaw is the lack of intensity and suspense the book so boldly created. While Ron Howard's god-like point of views and swinging camera movements create a magnificent cinematography, the action paid very little homage to the book. The 'twists' weren't twists at all, but rather, a quick burst of a plot change that had the audience in absolutely no hysterical awe.The acting was decent. Ian McKellen proved once again that he is one of our modern day's best actors, portraying Leigh Teabing in a much more animated way than I would have thought. And while he steals the spotlight, Tom Hanks (Robert Langdon) chooses to create a much more ordinary character. The more poignant role was that of Sophie Neveu, portrayed by Audrey Tatou. The sheer lack of believability that Audrey exhuberates to convince us that she is a genius cryptographer is almost as bad as her key monologues that fail to be clearly enunciated. But my personal favorite performance is Paul Bettany's creepy portrayal of the uber-creepy albino monk, Silas. His much underrated and overlooked ability to master the perfect accent and wow audiences with his convincing interpretation of an Opes Dei creation sticks through the entire film.In all, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a mind-boggling adventure ride. It spins our thoughts about a controversial topic and bounces us around with some pretty interesting ideas wonderfully portrayed on the screen. The score written by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Lion King) is perfect, and the set design is brilliant.In all honesty, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a movie that can be watched more than once, but not to over-analyze it and discuss the much talked about issue of religion, but because some audiences seem to forget that some movies are made for pure entertainment and nothing more. I really don't see the big deal with 'The Da Vinci Code,' it takes an approach to both sides of the argument about Christianity -- which is hilariously captured in a conversation between Leigh and Robert.I'd give it an 8/10 for proving that the second biggest selling novel of all time can in fact be shown and be seen by all audiences without damaging the reputation of the novel itself.",8,1,3,20 May 2006
Three Colors: Blue," The first installment of the best trilogy ever created
","'Blue' (along with 'White' and 'Red') is a cinematic masterpiece and one of (if not the) most innovative and powerful films of the 90s. Director-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski suggests an anti-climactic approach to a more visual interpretation of both physical and mental pain. How does one cope with loss of a loved one? How do we continue living if we're totally alone? Kieslowski forms a narrative around the characters in the story, and around their whole existence. Although the story is a deep focus of the heroine or protagonist, it shows the world both through and outside of her eyes.Juliette Binoche stars as Julie, a successful woman who has everything one would ever want, until one day when driving in a car with her family, the car crashes killing both her husband and daughter. After losing her family, Julie detaches herself from any memories, thoughts, and pain by giving up everything she's ever wanted, and starting a new life in an obscure area. Julie's deep passion always was and will be with music, and through her subconscious the music comes back and reminds her that she once was a happy woman.In the first five minutes of the movie you're completely hypnotized. It opens up with a closeup shot of a wheel from a car spinning on the street as the car drives. The cinematography sucks you in and almost foreshadows a more saddening mood, suggesting this road ends before the car reaches the destination. We're only shown the back of the characters in the car and we're left with very little to think about in terms of their psychology. Kieslowski knew exactly what he was doing by opening the scene in such a way. When the car crashes (in the most detailed and realistic crash scene I've ever seen), the movie cuts to a closeup of someone's eye in which we can see a man's reflection. We automatically know we are inside someone's head and that they are almost too tired to look at the man. Kieslowski's incredibly cinematic opening scene is just the beginning of a visually stunning and deep film.The eye is that of Julie's, who's lying in bed as the man tells her that her husband and her daughter are dead. We expect a big scene where the woman breaks down, smashing everything around her in a dramatic attempt to kill herself. But all we see is her shift her head and we know that she's suffering without having to show it. The idea of 'Blue' is to question whether or not someone can start over and heal without going through the mourning process. We are lead to believe that Julie can, but something always comes back and reminds us that maybe we are wrong. Some scenes create this illusion by having the picture fade to black as we hear music then fades back to the picture. We all know that a technique in editing where fading to black is used to represent passage of time. But in this situation, it's nothing of the sort. Julie constantly blocks any memory from her mind, but the mind always pushes those memories out. Her husband was a composer and the music she suddenly hears is both a reflection of her past and a reminder to her that she is still alive.Every minute of the movie we are exposed to the pain that Julie is experiencing. This is more of a statement than it is an expression though, since Kieslowski uses magnificent techniques to draw out this emotion. In one scene, Julie is swimming in a pool (where she goes every night to let out her physical energy so that she doesn't explode with everything she's been keeping in), and her husband's music starts playing in her head. She pauses and allows herself to sway back into the pool, in the part of it that represents death. Juliette Binoche describes this as a form of a fetus who's not yet pushed into the real world.Kieslowski loves to pay attention to detail. Everything that's on the screen is a form of reality and a symbol of pain, suffering and isolation. For example, the scene in which Julie is in a restaurant drinking coffee exemplified just how much this woman is emotionally constricted. She hears music that she and her husband wrote, and she automatically shelters herself away from it, to disallow herself to have her memories come back. She quietly puts a cube into her coffee and watches the sugar turn brown. To some extent this is a perfect example of how not only Julie is withdrawn from life and others, but so are we, the audience.There's no doubt that this allegory is a masterpiece in film-making. Kieslowski often moves in and out of the frame with the camera, showing us a world that we're meant to see, instead of just placing an element in a frame and keeping it there to blatantly smack us with the message. To some, 'Blue' is a masterpiece and to me it's also inspiration. Everything from its incredible cinematography to the haunting and memorable score, is flawless. Whether or not 'Blue' is the least favorite of the trilogy, it comes in at my list (and many other's) as one of the best movies of all time.",10,0,2,3 August 2006
Rear Window," Shocking, suspenseful, and flat out original.
","In most people's minds, 'Rear Window' is another one of those Hitchcock thrillers that present a big shock or two. However, what Hitchcock presented in this film is much more than just one of the biggest suspense movies of all time, it's a true representation of our own desire to look into the private lives of others. It's a story about a realistic approach to voyeurism and the outcomes that follow. At first, leading man Jimmy Stewart denies his own boredom by sitting by his apartment window observing his neighbors, but soon realizes it may have been for the best.L.B Jefferies (Stewart) is a professional photographer who broke his leg and is strapped to his chair with minimal capability to enjoy any activities. With nothing to do, he spies on his neighbors who he knows nothing about. He becomes more skeptical of his neighborhood as one of them becomes delusional and depressed, attempting to take her own life. Also, higher up in the building, a businessman suspiciously gets rid of his invalid wife, leaving Jefferies to believe he had killed her. Gene Kelley plays Stewart's eccentric girlfriend who at first thinks Jefferies has gone too far by spying on his neighbors, but soon plays a big part in his game when she too suspects a murder in the building across.Hitchcock cleverly orchestrates a vision so realistic and powerful that we dare not ever look in the wrong direction again. The entire film is set in one location: Jefferie's apartment. Every shot of the neighbors, buildings, and strangers is shown from Jefferie's point of view, making it all the more claustrophobic and realistic. We know almost nothing about the neighbors, and very little about Jefferies (for example, how he broke his leg), which only adds to the urge to know more about others and the irony that we know it's wrong yet we can't help but to look away.The directing is superb and we can almost instantly see Hitchcock's influence on huge directors such as PT Anderson and Quentin Tarantino with his endless tracking shots and flawless choreography of one seemingly endless scene. Hitchcock also chooses a perfect set-design, helping to create a very open yet confined space. The score may not be as good as other Hitchcock films but it fits the mood quite well. We hear both internal and external music, which Hitchcock intelligently connected in order for us to feel the mood he is conveying and to understand the realism of the movie.'Rear Window' has to be one of Hitchcock's best movies. More than just a clever suspense story, we are exposed to an entire social conflict that resembles our own lives. Our own flawed behavior gets hidden behind closed doors but as we see this film we start to understand the complexity of the characters and how they relate to us.I'll give this movie a 9/10 because of my very minor problem with the score and that I just can't help but compare it to the flawless work of Hitchcock's 'Psycho' and 'Vertigo.'",9,0,4,15 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A class example of how to make a fantasy epic
","'Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is a visually stunning reach into the imagination. It is a deep and complex journey into the unknown, the dangerous and the inescapable. The previous two installments, 'The Fellowship of the Rings', and 'The Two Towers' present elements in which this film connects them together to quietly and subtly present nostalgia as the journey finally ends. The 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is by far the most cinematically beautiful trilogy ever created, so it's no surprise that this final chapter in the saga goes out with a bang. This is a tale about courage, survival, fate, and friendship. More pleasant to watch than the previous film, it is a bold ending to a bold adventure.In this final installment, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must realize his destiny as the king of men and gather his army for the final fight of Middle Earth. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Voiced by Andy Serkis), formerly known as Smeagol, lurk through the dark cities and mountains in order to reach Mount Doom and destroy the ring once and for all. Complications arise as Frodo suspects Sam of betrayal and theft, while Gollum plans to murder Frodo and take the ring back. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) rides with Pippin (Billy Boyd) to Minas Tirith to warn the humans of the attack, while Arwen (Liv Tyler) realizes she is to become a mortal and have a child with Aragorn. The story comes to its final climax as Frodo reaches the core of Mount Doom and Aragorn, together with his army leads the Mount Doom army away to set a clear path for Frodo.From minute one, you get sucked into the insanely arousing visuals. The stellar special effects and the epic battles that include incredibly intricate fighting scenes, along with stellar sound, to make the epic battle realistic and fast. The most complex and stunning CGI creation is the creature Gollum (who we see transform from human to monster in the first 10 minutes of the movie). His fish-eyes move around and his body language sways and we forget that he isn't real. And as he attempts to steal the ring and frame Sam, that feeling sets in as though we've been watching a villain kill the main protagonist. In some ways, he has more character traits than a lot of the human actors in the movie. For example, when he talks to himself while looking at his own reflection in the water, he exhibits countless emotions and we know the torment he is experiencing.Peter Jackson combines CGI and real settings but we never know it. We cannot tell whether a pathway is computer generated or built, whether a door that leads to a lava pit is trick photography or just a different setting. He is able to direct in such a way that the city of Minas Tirith looks both impossible to build, but very convincing. Even Mount Doom seems realistic and we question whether it is a real volcano or just another one of Jackson's genius visions. Not to mention the final battle of Middle Earth, we're constantly thrown into moving mammoths, flying humans, arrows appearing out of nowhere, rocks falling from the sky, people running, swords swinging. And it's all done in one single scene. Our eyes widen with excitement and disbelief, and we can't look away.Not far away from the complete CGI fighting, Frodo and Sam walk up a set of stairs as a shortcut that Gollum showed them to get to Mount Doom quicker. Sam's becoming restless but still gives all of the food to Frodo. Gollum is becoming more impatient, and Frodo is walking into the dark side. We question whether or not Frodo will make it to Mount Doom, and whether Sam will be able to help him. But even if they do make it, will they make it back? We want hope, and no character better than Gandalf offers that to us. He says 'I see Frodo. He is alive' as he smiles and cheerfully pats Aragorn on the back.There are many scenes in which the audience feels emotion for the character, the situation and the outcome. For example, Denethor (John Noble) finds that his son had been killed and summons his younger son into battle. Upon his son's return he loses his mind and starts to burn himself and his son alive in an attempt to rid himself of guilt. In another very powerful scene, Pippin stands in Denethor's presence as he starts singing a song. This song parallels beautifully the beginning of the big fight, as the Orcs fly and run towards the castle.The directing is undoubtedly superb, and every aspect of the visuals is brilliant. There isn't even a need to comment on the details since from one look at the movie it is a given. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is an incredible gem and a wonderfully directed film. This final film is a perfect example of how a fantasy epic can work in every way possible.",10,2,5,8 August 2006
