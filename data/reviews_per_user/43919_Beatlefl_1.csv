Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great movie! but...
","But nothing! lol It is a great film, and to those of you who were disappointed by what was presented before you, realize that episode 1 is just A PART of a full story. True, compared to ANH (the first of the sacred trilogy) could and would have been able to stand its own if ESB and ROTJ had never been created. However, the same could not be about EP1:TPM.  Being a true Star Wars freak that I am, EP1:TPM greatly amazed me and I truly enjoyed it. In addition, I am anxiously waiting for my next viewing of the currently released prequel! Perhaps even more anxious than waiting to see it the first time.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
