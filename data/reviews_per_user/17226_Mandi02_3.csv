The Blair Witch Project," Sorry- It Sucked
","When I first heard about this move- I was dying to see it. I was so completely disappointed in the movie- it was a waste of perfectly good time. I was, quite frankly, not afraid. At all. The entire movie was one big profanity. The three characters screaming f*** this and f*** that and f***you, etc were bad actors adding to a bad plot. Now, I must give some credit to the film makers for some very clever advertisement, and a good idea... maybe next time... make it silent. There was not a meaningful thing said in the entire movie... By the way- I am a youth- 16 years old, go to a public high school, and I have probably not cussed that much in my entire life.",1,2,4,17 January 2000
The Mummy," I can't believe they let this out in theaters...
","This was the most pathetic attempt at a movie I have ever seen. It was TERRIBLE. When I voted, I wished I could give it a ZERO.  It was unworthy of even a one. It was a waste of an hour of my time and 6 bucks to see it... this was worse than Godzilla!",1,3,8,18 January 2000
Notting Hill," I liked it! I really did.
","I found this movie touching. It kind of leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, like you just want to run out and fall in love right then. The music, especially She, by Elvis Costello, just creates a mood that everything is so perfectly RIGHT for them. It is beautiful.  I didn't find it boring or dull (in response to the other comments)but maybe that's because this is sort of a 'chick flick' and well, I'm a 'chick', so those chick flicks appeal to me. But really, it was not just a romance.. it was funny. I laughed (and cried) straight through it, and I would consider it a worthwhile rental (and totally the 6 bucks i paid to see it in the theater!)",9,0,0,17 January 2000
