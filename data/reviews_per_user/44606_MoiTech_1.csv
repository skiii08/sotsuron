Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The most subtle Star Wars ever made
","This episode in the Star Wars saga is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars ever produced, and the best movie i've ever seen.  The only problem is that the movie is very subtle and is not easy to understand if you did not see the other movies, and if you didn't read the books.  The story is more complex than the other films, with more political events.  George Lucas was able to bring back the Star Wars feeling.  The movie is visualy perfect and the music of Mr. Williams was simply one of his best soundtrack.  Don't forget that this production is only the first episode of a trilogy, it is only an introduction, we must wait to see the entire trilogy...",7,0,0,15 October 1999
