Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Loved it, even though it contains flaws
","I loved the movie in every way, the action, the romance, the cast, the plot, etc. Even if Elizabeth and Will (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, respectively) aren't in the movie, at least we know their story from the previous movies. Plus, who doesn't like the relationship between Syrena and Philip (played by Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey and Sam Claflin, respectively). Although, it would be great if they were in the next movie, and if Philip's fate was more clear, but other than that, it was a great film and it reminds me a bit like Catching Fire, The Lost Future, and a lot of other movies that I've seen and loved.I don't mind flaws, as long as they aren't very big and noticeable. However, this movie could be better, like if the ending wasn't a huge cliffhanger, and other flaws. It probably deserves a 9, but for the relationship between Syrena and Philip, I'll be nice and give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides a 10.",10,0,1,16 May 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I actually liked it better than the original
","I loved the movie, but what I don't like is that people think it's a ripoff of Battle Royale (which I guess is true, but not completely and exactly the same) Catching Fire is awesome, I loved the cast (especially the new ones) and the action is pretty amazing. But why do people think it's a ripoff of Battle Royale?!! It's not the same, sure it shares similar traits, but that doesn't make it a ripoff. But it's awesome, and sorry, but it seems better than Twilight (not completely sure, never saw Twilight, so I can't guarantee that.)Anyway, the characters are awesome, the Quarter Quell is a twist that was awesome. And, no more shaky cameras (even though I didn't notice that very well.) This film is by far the best of the franchise. Even better than The Fault in Our Stars, though it didn't seem like it.",10,4,7,1 June 2016
