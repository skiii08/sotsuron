The Blair Witch Project," Sick of foul language!
","Time for me to get on my soapbox. I'm sick and tired of filthy language, and this film has guaranteed it that for me to watch another film that has received a warning rating because of strong language (in this case, read 'filth') will be the day that heck freezes over. The acting was pretty believable, the idea was neat. I gave the film a '5' because of this, but I obviously will not recommend it to anyone I know because of the language. My wife and I watched it with the audio off and the closed caption on just to see how it ended. Disappointed.",5,0,1,2 December 1999
The Mummy," Short and concise appreciation for this film.
","I loved this flick. It was funny, scary and sexy without being stupid, wretching or sleezy. The special effects worked for the movie, the acting was professional. I will watch it again and will not hesitate to refer it to anyone who loves a 'scary' movie that comes across without negative and excessive blood & guts. Additional plusses: No nudity or foul language.",10,0,0,2 December 1999
