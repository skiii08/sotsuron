Casablanca," Wow!!!
","My friends and I talked for a long time about hiring Casablanca. Therefore, when I saw him in the library for free, I, of course, ventured to borrow him!The big day has come - we were going to see the most classic film of all time. And what an experience it was to see the film. I mean, the film was excellent from the very beginning to the end. MASTERPIECE! Very great cast performance too! Be sure to look ...",Null,1,1,8 March 2020
A Bridge Too Far," 10\10
",I am a big fan of war films and a special place in my collection is occupied by historical films. 'Bridge too far' is one of them. This is a real film from which we can learn how things really were and how this operation affected the final defeat of the Nazis,Null,0,1,27 October 2019
U-571," 8\10 great show
","This is a wonderful war movie about heroes on submarines. Of course for me the coolest underwater movie will always be 'Submarine'. But here we also see what our guys had to experience, so that in the end we deserved to win against the Nazis. I will not speak on behalf of the real story, but watch it and have fun",Null,0,1,27 October 2019
Schindler's List," 3/10
","I've seen many documentaries on A&E, History Channel, etc on the holocaust and I guess I just presumed that everyone else had too. Apparently a lot of people never have, never read about it in school or anything either. After it was over, these people in the theater were all sitting there like they were stunned or something. Like they just had no idea that stuff like that happened during WWII. I was thinking to myself 'lets just get the heck out of here'.
I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble, emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his Sledge-o-matic. Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end. It's all quite tedious to watch.",Null,2,11,29 October 2019
1917," Super!!!
",1917 is the BEST war movie ever! Great job by the cast as well as great directing by Sam Mendes. I can see why this movie is nominated for 10 Oscars. I hope it sweeps the Oscars as it very well deserves to. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!,Null,0,4,2 February 2020
Midway," expected better...
","While sitting in the theatre, I was sure most men wanted to be them, and most women wanted to do them. Hell, when I watched Dick Best dive bomb a Japanese destroyer and then turn back and go at them one more time as if he was returning a few rounds of blazing hot lead he borrowed last week, I briefly considered giving my wife a hall-pass for him that night; only him, though.That, though, is the problem I have with Roland Emmerich's Midway, the mercurial, big-screen action director, whose new film is much more Independence Day than Saving Private Ryan. These CGI special effects are great to look at, gorgeous even, but cartoonish because so much of it is computer-generated. You never have the feeling that if you reach out, you could touch a live-action plane; this is Star Wars, but now instead of Star Fighters and Y-Wings they are Aichi D34 Carrier-Borne Bombers, Douglas SDB-3 Dauntless Dive Bombers, and Douglas TBD Devastators; the carriers and destroyers are Star Cruisers and Death Stars. The film though, you are talking about a film which is so heavily invested in flight and vintage aircraft that it does an admirable job. The team here does build up a certain amount of suspense and thrills; mainly, the dive-bombing scenes gave me a sense of awe-struck pride and amazement. It's almost the equivalent of a child playing with a toy plane, and making bomb noises with their mouths as they send the plane towards the mother's carpeted family room floor (not the living room floor, that's the room always marked off for 'company'). The film's scripted dialogue is recycled from war films of its own ilk multiple decades before, even though I was slightly relieved when they did acknowledge sacrifices on the other side of unseen events by civilians.",Null,5,23,7 November 2019
Windtalkers," Nicolas Cage!!!
","As I've read other reviews here, I agree with them on how Nicolas Cage wins us the war wherever he appears. It was funny. Although himself the film me grassroots.",Null,0,1,27 October 2019
