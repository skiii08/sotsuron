The Blair Witch Project," Shaky and Annoying
","I felt nauseated after I left the movie theater not from being scared but from the constant shaking of the camcorder this movie was recorded on. At some point in the movie you see some bloody body part on some bundled sticks. You can't even make out whether it is a finger, nose, tooth or nothing at all. The characters were supremely annoying. Basically the one sentence that was used over and over again was 'No, you shut up'. The sad part of this movie was that it had the potential to be a great character movie. Instead they did not focus on anything (literally) and basically just wasted time bouncing around in the forest. Go rent Deliverance or Scream instead. 4/10.",4,0,1,6 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Slow eye candy
","Infidelity is the topic of this over the top drama. The doctor played by Cruise explores a sexual universe after finding out about his wife's fantasies. It is a gorgeous movie with a lot of unbelievable women. Had it been only 2 hours, it would have been better.",8,0,0,21 July 1999
