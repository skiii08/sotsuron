Insidious: Chapter 2," A step down, but it is still a more than solid effort
","'Insidious: Chapter 2' keeps the level of the film series so far to a suitable level, though it is some way off its predecessor.The film, as you'd probably expect, relies heavily on the 2010 production, with quite a few reused scenes from it - even some from early in this one, too. It is with good reason, as it splices fairly well into what occurs here. I think they do try a little too hard with it in parts, though all in all it comes out decently.They sideline Rose Byrne for a lot of this, which is disappointing given she's arguably the best at acting of those involved. I assume it's down to scheduling conflicts with other commitments, if so it's nice she still appears.Due to the aforementioned, Patrick Wilson takes centre stage - not to great appraisal unfortunately. I find his performance quite inferior, at least compared to the one he gives in 'Insidious'. None of the others stand out, though I do appreciate them retaining the same onscreen people.This is certainly a step down, but it is still a more than solid effort.",7,0,1,14 May 2020
Gremlins," Gizmo is simply adorable
","'Gremlins' is certainly worth a watch.The cast do an OK job, but it's the Mogwai that pretty much carry it. They're funny and look fantastic, especially given this film came out in the early 1980s - Gizmo is simply adorable. The ending drags out a little, which is my only real criticism.",8,1,2,8 February 2020
Skyfall," 'Skyfall' is superb
","'Skyfall' is superb.Daniel Craig continues to shine as Bond, giving one of his best performances in the role here. He isn't my favourite James Bond lead, that doesn't mean he is anything less than impressive though.Javier Bardem is this film's main villain. I love what he brings to the table, he is outstanding as Silva. Naomie Harris is a welcomed addition, I would've liked to have seen her given more screen time in truth. Small shoutout to Ben Whishaw also, he makes for a very good Q.In terms of the plot, I think it is one of the best from the series so far. Although, I will say it wraps up pretty surprisingly - given what the entirety of the film spends doing beforehand. I still enjoyed it, mind.Not as terrific as Craig's debut in 'Casino Royale' or two other Bond productions, but this makes the upper echelons of my 007 ranking.",8,1,4,28 March 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A good film, but nothing more
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable. The special effects are solid though, as is the score by John Williams.It makes for a fun enough watch, even if I did expect better.",7,8,8,16 April 2020
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Pretty great
","'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' is pretty great, certainly my favourite animated film from Disney up until the point of this release.The animation is stunning, even with the minor details in and around the Radcliffe residence. The dalmatians themselves look excellent, while the premise keeps you locked in. It also features one of the studio's greatest villains in Cruella de Vil, who is incredibly wicked.I like the voice cast here, also. Rod Taylor is very good as Pongo, with Ben Wright doing positive things as Roger. Horace and Jasper, voiced by Frederick Worlock and J. Pat O'Malley, are there to amuse too. Betty Lou Gerson is, of course, the star as Cruella.I prefer the 1996 live-action production as it brings things to life better, but this is a fantastic effort from 1961 - one that is certainly worth your time viewing.",8,0,0,28 May 2020
A Star Is Born," Awesome film
","'A Star Is Born' is an awesome film. Bradley Cooper stars as Jackson, with Lady Gaga showing off her acting abilities as Ally. Beautifully told story, very well shot, strong music and a good supporting cast; most notably Sam Elliott.",9,0,0,1 March 2020
Mulan," Pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be
","'Mulan' is good Disney.There's a lot to enjoy about this film, it's not without a few less entertaining parts but overall it's one that many will like. The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.Ming-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the 'Shrek' franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.Animation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.I do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable.",7,0,0,2 July 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Highly recommend
","A high quality film, as I assumed it would be.I'm not actually a big fan of the cast here though, which is rare based on the other Quentin Tarantino productions I've seen. That's not to say they are bad, absolutely far from it, but I just didn't overly enjoy a lot of the performances.That's with one huge exception of course - Christoph Waltz. He is outstanding as Landa, it's consistently a joy to watch him act - that early scene with him at the LaPadite household is excellent. Away from Waltz, MÃ©lanie Laurent is very good in her role as Shosanna.The plot and the way it's portrayed is what stands this film up. It has some majestic, tension-filled scenes, great dialogue and the eventual pay-off is fulfilling. In fact, for me, 'Inglourious Basterds' got a little less interesting between the middle and end parts, though thankfully the conclusion grabbed me back in.Highly recommend.",9,0,2,1 April 2020
Public Enemies," Probably be rating it lower if not for Depp and Bale
","The cast is what makes 'Public Enemies' fun.Johnny Depp is great as Dillinger, he lifts a load of average scenes and makes them way more interesting. Christian Bale does likewise as Purvis, those two were excellent casting choices.The film also features other familiar faces, e.g. Stephen Graham and Giovanni Ribisi, who are all fairly accomplished in their respective roles. The down parts of this production, for me at least, are the plot and the editing.Plot-wise it is a little drawn-out, it can feel a bit pedestrian in the moments away from the fire-fights. Some of the editing comes across choppy, during a few of the action scenes in particular.I still had a decent time watching, though I'd probably be rating it lower if not for Depp and Bale.",7,1,1,3 April 2020
The Jungle Book," Go watch!
","An entertaining watch.'The Jungle Book' is ideal family viewing, with its warm characters and catchy music. The plot isn't the deepest, shown by the lesser conclusion, though on the whole you can't help but smile throughout.Mowgli, despite being the protagonist, isn't one of the best; Bruce Reitherman is solid if unspectacular. The real stars of the film are Baloo (Phil Harris) and Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), as well as side characters Kaa (Sterling Holloway) and King Louie (Louis Prima). George Sanders does good as Shere Khan, but it is surprising that he isn't seen until the final act.This arguably features Disney's greatest songs from this era of their productions. 'The Bare Necessities' is the standout for me, but 'Colonel Hathi's March' and 'I Wan'na Be like You' are terrific too. All sing-a-long worthy.The film is a largely just for fun 78 minutes, which is why the more serious finale doesn't avoid falling flat a little bit. It's still an OK ending, just not on the same level as what builds up to it in my opinion.Go watch!",7,0,0,31 May 2020
Don Jon," A sex comedy done right
","Funny film. A sex comedy done right.The first 10-15 minutes, aside from the slick editing, had me worried - I was expecting the worst. However, to my pleasant surprise, it delivers as an amusing film about sex and pornography - it even goes away with a positive message.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as Jon, I thoroughly enjoyed his performance and what we get to learn about 'Don Jon'. Scarlett Johansson is good as Barbara, while Julianne Moore and Tony Danza support astutely. Brie Larson's character is utterly pointless, but in a way that's actually quite chucklesome - which I assume is the intention.The editing and camera work in this took my notice as well, both help keep the pacing going as it never feels like it's stalling at any point. I like this film, you should give it a watch.",8,1,1,27 April 2020
The Bodyguard," Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston team up to strong effect
","'The Bodyguard' makes for entertaining viewing from the early 1990s, as Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston team up to strong effect.Costner plays the titular role of Frank, very nicely might I add. You like the character pretty instantaneously, feeling as if he is the perfect man to protect Rachel. Houston, as the latter, is impressively good given it's her film debut, I really enjoy her performance throughout the 129 minutes.That aforementioned run time is probably too long, as the film does drag its legs as the third act is on the horizon; everything before and after that moment is entertaining, though. Another critique of mine would be the editing, which is choppy in parts.Houston's soundtrack is obviously excellent, while the premise is certainly engaging. It doesn't do everything else perfectly, but this is still one to watch and have a very fine time with.",8,0,0,20 May 2020
The Town," 'The Town' is brilliant
","'The Town' is brilliant.Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner play the respective roles of Doug and Jem tremendously, while the plot is well written and the music is fitting. A few of the other crew members are perhaps underdeveloped, but that's my only issue with this film - and it's not even a notable one.",9,0,0,4 March 2020
Ocean's Thirteen," A tad drawn out though it does deliver by the end
","'Ocean's Thirteen' marks the end of the Ocean's trilogy in a good way.It's slightly below the level of 'Ocean's Eleven' but does better 'Ocean's Twelve'. As with the preceding two, the cast elevate these films up with strong performances from George Clooney & Co. In regards to O13, I feel the plot is a tad drawn out though it does deliver by the end with its entertaining outcome.",8,6,6,13 February 2020
American Sniper," 'American Sniper' is very good
","A beautifully made film regarding a remarkable individual in Chris Kyle. Bradley Cooper plays the lead role tremendously, as Clint Eastwood & Co. set everything else up expertly. One or two, minor, pacing/editing issues aside, 'American Sniper' is very good.",8,36,54,4 February 2020
21 Jump Street," That late cameo was pretty cool
","Good stuff. '21 Jump Street' starts extremely slowly, but once it gets going it becomes a fun film to watch. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum do well, though Dave Franco is probably the performance I'll remember most from this. Lastly, that late cameo was pretty cool.",7,1,1,11 January 2020
Divergent," I did expect more, but I think there's enough here to have a decent time with
","Could've, and perhaps should've, been greater.'Divergent' does makes for a good watch, it has a lot of positive elements to it and features two strong leads. However, the dialogue and the way the characters act up until the third act is irritating, especially at the beginning as they introduce all those involved.Shailene Woodley is excellent in her role, she brings likeable qualities to Tris alongside a sense of strength. I also liked Theo James, who portrays Four. A few of the others, like ZoÃ« Kravitz (Christina) and Miles Teller (Peter), are OK too. With that said, they are all let down by the aforementioned iffy dialogue.I rate the initial world building and all the different factions, though that's one of the (many) areas where I think this film could've been great - so much more can be done with that. More development into the enemies would've been nice too, namely with Kate Winslet's Jeanine. Better fitting music is another thing that was needed.I did expect more, but I think there's enough here to have a decent time with.",7,0,0,18 May 2020
Goon," A decent sports comedy
","Very solid.'Goon' makes for a decent sports comedy. It actually keeps good focus on the sporting stuff involved, even if it isn't an important thing in the grand scheme of the film. It's definitely comedy-centric, but it has a bit more to it than what is usual for this genre.Seann William Scott leads as Doug, a surprisingly nice individual despite the obvious nature of his other antics - you find yourself rooting for him. The rest of the cast aren't anything to write home about, but that's not a big deal as it's just a film to have a laugh with and not take too seriously.Not sure where they go for the sequel, hopefully it avoids the dreaded 'sequelitis'.",7,0,0,1 April 2020
Yesterday," I enjoyed seeing it play out
","Good film.'Yesterday' has an interesting concept, as we see a world without some of history's biggest musicians - that's until Jack Malik brings them back to life, just not in the correct manner. I enjoyed seeing it play out.The cast isn't all-star at all, but Himesh Patel, Lily James and Joel Fry all give convincing performances. Ed Sheeran also appears, as himself - he's decent, if a little wooden. The off-screen names are probably more stellar, with Danny Boyle directing and Richard Curtis doing the screenplay.It's nothing outstanding, though you'll likely have an enjoyable time watching it - especially if you love The Beatles.",7,0,0,15 April 2020
Quantum of Solace," I definitely expected more
","Not entirely sure how I feel about this one.The cast involved are decent, the plot is fairly intriguing, the locations are tremendous and the music is satisfying. However, I don't feel anything towards the characters involved. I should care more for Bond, for Camille, for Fields but I simply don't.I definitely expected more, given how 'Casino Royale' concluded in a way that was clear it had 'Quantum of Solace' in mind. It still makes the top eight in terms of my James Bond ranking at this point, but I thought it would be a film that would place higher up.",7,0,0,27 March 2020
Days of Thunder," Cruise is good
","A fun sports drama.'Days of Thunder' stars Tom Cruise as Cole Trickle, an up-and-coming young racer entering NASCAR. Cruise is good in this, though it's probably the weakest acting display that I've seen from him.Robert Duvall, Michael Rooker and Nicole Kidman are all alongside Cruise. Duvall appears as Harry well, while Kidman is decent as Claire. Rooker is my standout of the three though, I enjoyed all his scenes as Rowdy.This film has a good pace to it, helped by the fact it gets into the racing stuff pretty early on. I found the romance between Cole and Claire a little dull, though Cole and Rowdy's story was always interesting. I thought we'd get a final scene between the latter two to be honest.Not one of Tom Cruise's best, but an entertaining film nevertheless.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
Remember the Titans," Denzel Washington is obviously the star
","'Remember the Titans' tackles some social issues of 1971 to deliver a heartfelt film about an American football team.Denzel Washington is obviously the star of the show here. He gives a terrific performance as Herman, quite a few excellent scenes involve him; as usual with his films in truth. Will Patton is sound as Bill, while Ethan Suplee is hilarious in his parts as Louie.Credit to Ronna Kress for the rest of the casting, a lot of well-known faces in this. Ryan Gosling, Ryan Hurst, Hayden Panettiere, Donald Faison - that's pretty impressive.As with most biopics, it isn't 100% accurate but it does a respectable job at the portrayal of problems of the time - even if it is carried by Washington & Co.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
The Little Mermaid," A solid film, just not one of my own favourites
","Another one of the studio's films I hadn't previously seen, this one has a huge following even today. Whilst I don't personally agree it's top tier Disney, it's definitely one of the better ones from their early decades.It has catchy songs, memorable characters and a fun premise so I can see the reasoning for its hype. Jodi Benson does very well in the lead role of Ariel, while Pat Carroll (Ursula) and, most so, Samuel E. Wright (Sebastian) both give unforgettable voice performances. The latter is great, as he also has the best song in 'Under the Sea'.'The Little Mermaid' merges together for a solid film, just not one of my own favourites.",7,0,0,11 June 2020
Aladdin," I'm a fan
","I'm a fan of 2019's remake of 'Aladdin'. It isn't as great as the original from twenty-seven years prior, though it does a fine job nevertheless.Will Smith is no Robin Williams obviously, but no-one would ever have met the extremely high standards that Mr. Williams set as Genie. Smith does well, I enjoy his humour and overall performance in this.Mena Massoud is very likeable as the titular character, I think he brings more life to Aladdin than Scott Weinger does from 1992. Naomi Scott is excellent as Jasmine, who is miles more developed in this production.Now for the elephant in the room: Jafar.Marwan Kenzari, if I only judge his performance, is more than satisfactory. However, he simply has to be judged based on Jonathan Freeman's version of the antagonist. Kenzari's Jafar is nowhere near as fearsome and devilish as he should be, I'm never uneasy when he appears here.Away from the wannabe Sultan, I would've liked to have seen more of Abu and, especially, Iago - who should've been voiced by Gilbert Gottfried by the way. On the other hand, Navid Negahban is decent as Jasmine's father.Overall, despite some iffy CGI and editing, it makes for entertaining viewing. The music, although changed, is as fun as before (I also liked Jasmine's new song, 'Speechless'). I've seen lesser remakes, that's for sure.",8,1,1,19 April 2020
Insidious," There are scenes that are tension-filled
","A good horror flick.'Insidious' isn't necessarily scary, but there are scenes that are tension-filled; particularly when the full cast get together. It paces itself nicely, it never drags once which is pleasing. The premise is very interesting, it's brought to life by an accomplished cast.Rose Byrne is impressive as Renai, Patrick Wilson is more than solid for the majority while Lin Shaye (Elise) and Angus Sampson (Tucker) add positive things in their respective roles. A well chosen bunch.It's all filmed fine and the supernatural characters look creepy enough, though my only complaint is that it would've been great to see more from the threatening entities but I guess that's the point. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
The Theory of Everything," A real charmer
","A real charmer of a film. Eddie Redmayne plays the role of Stephen Hawking superbly, as 'The Theory of Everything' portrays Hawking's exceptional life. J贸hann J贸hannsson's score is very good, it really gets you attached to each scene.",8,0,1,31 December 2019
The Lion King," It's great, but only thanks to the original film
","It's great, but only thanks to the original film.Simply put, the 2019 version of 'The Lion King' is fantastic. However, it doesn't do enough to separate itself from its predecessor, as it's largely the same thing just with an - admittedly beautiful - animation facelift.I like Donald Glover, Seth Rogan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Beyoncé in this, though they don't stop it from being one of Disney's weakest and most needless remakes; which is only worthy to those who haven't seen the 1994 release.",8,0,1,22 February 2020
22 Jump Street," An overall improvement
","'22 Jump Street' is an overall improvement on '21 Jump Street'. However, it kinda levelled out by the end.Its predecessor started slowly but got better as it finished, whereas 22JS does the opposite. Terrific beginning which gave laughs, though it lost its way a little by the conclusion. This one has an excellent initial closing credits, one of the funniest I've seen.",7,0,0,12 January 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Part III was an ideal time to end things
","'Back to the Future Part III' is the weakest installment of the series, though still produces a good, solid film to wrap the trilogy up.The western theme was nice, while the two stars again produced excellent displays. However, the plot began to wear thin a little bit - part III was an ideal time to end things.",7,2,2,30 January 2020
Hidden Figures," Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe are superbly chosen
","Quality.I remember hearing a lot of positive things about 'Hidden Figures' back when it was released in 2016 but never got around to watching it - until now. I can understand the hype this had/has.Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe are superbly chosen, their chemistry together is top notch - you buy their friendship completely. Henson is the standout of the three, there's one scene of pure frustration for Katherine where Henson's performance is simply fantastic.Kevin Costner is good here as Harrison, though the characters of Jim Parsons (Paul) and Kirsten Dunst (Vivian) are a little roughly developed. Other pluses from this film include the music and the cinematography.There does seem to be a load of artistic license used, even for some important scenes, which is a little disappointing as it would've been nice to have a more truthful telling of this era in world history. With that said, I guess it is a film first so making it strong in that regard is more important.In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this.",9,0,0,12 May 2020
Kelly's Heroes," Worth watching, for sure
","Clint Eastwood stars in an enjoyable war/heist film.'Kelly's Heroes' doesn't seem like it was released in 1970, the vast majority of it still holds up today; almost exactly fifty years on. The run time is a little bit too long but not by much, as I felt entertained for the most part.As already stated, Eastwood is this production's lead and he performs impeccably. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland also do good jobs here, the former as Joe and the latter as Oddball. That end showdown scene with those three is excellent.My only major criticism of the film would be the lack of character development, none of the protagonists have any real depth to them. Perhaps, as Eastwood has since stated, that's due to MGM deleting the scenes that they did though I'm not entirely convinced by that argument.Worth watching, for sure.",8,1,1,10 April 2020
Here Comes the Boom," One of the better films from Kevin James
","One of the better films from Kevin James.'Here Comes the Boom' has substance to it, as it strikes a decent balance between the comedy and the hearty narrative. I'm not saying it's top tier by any means, but I had a fine time watching this.",7,0,1,21 February 2020
A Bug's Life," The film flies through its 95 minute run time
","A thoroughly enjoyable production from Disney and Pixar.'A Bug's Life' cobbles together nice animation, fun characters and a memorable voice cast. The premise is entertaining, as the film flies through its 95 minute run time. The score is pretty solid, also.Dave Foley is good in the role of Flik, while Kevin Spacey is actually great as Hopper; shame about the actor himself, obviously. There's a load of other noteworthy members of the voice cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Atta), Hayden Panettiere (Dot), Bonnie Hunt (Rosie) and John Ratzenberger (P.T.) as well as many others - one of the studios' best casts.I actually prefer, somewhat controversially I guess, 'Antz' to this - only marginally though, as I truly like them both. I'd say watch the pair, if you can!",8,0,0,4 July 2020
Mama," Pretty run-of-the-mill
","Pretty run-of-the-mill, none of it will likely be remembered by me.My main takeaway from 'Mama' is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who is very good as Lucas & Jeffrey; the others do solid jobs in their roles in fairness.In terms of the plot, nothing really happened - I was waiting for something big to occur but it never came. With that said, the film's ending is fine though it doesn't connect on an emotive level.",7,0,0,16 February 2020
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray is the sole reason
","I've finally watched 'Groundhog Day', probably one of the longest gaps between discovering a film and actually viewing it. I now get why it's a highly rated one.Bill Murray is the sole reason for that. His performance here is tremendous, his delivery is absolutely perfect for the role. Cool to see Michael Shannon in his silver screen debut, I like a lot of his work; most notably as Van Alden in 'Boardwalk Empire'.Back to this, the premise is portrayed nicely despite the repeat nature of the events. I do have questions about it, there's a few holes as well as the overall blurred message it attempts to set, but there's no doubting it's a funny film; which is most important when it comes to comedies.In regards to the ending, I expected it to conclude under a different tone. To me, what Phil does during the penultimate revisits isn't massively different to what he does for the final time, the motives seem similar. About the tone, I thought it was going to stick with the one it set around the elderly gentleman but it doesn't.That last paragraph isn't an important matter, I'm certainly over-analysing it, but these are just my thoughts.A must-watch.",8,0,0,10 April 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Very good film, first and foremost
","'Reservoir Dogs' is a very good film, first and foremost.It manages to keep you locked in for the full duration despite everything revolving around a major incident which you don't even see. It is extremely talky in most parts, but the strong dialogue makes it worthwhile.Pretty much all of the characters are unlikable individuals, so the film does a good job at keeping you interested in the story - Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink is the prime example. I thoroughly enjoyed Buscemi's performance. Harvey Keitel is another strong performer in this.The ending would be my only non-positive comment. It's not even a bad conclusion, it just wraps up way quicker than I thought it would.",8,0,1,9 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Luke Evans is top notch as Gaston
","It's good. I don't mind remakes, as long as they bring new, positive things into the mix - 'Beauty and the Beast' does that.I don't have any noteworthy issues with it in truth, the casting is excellent while the musical pieces are put together nicely. Luke Evans is top notch as Gaston, he really brings his character to life. Ewan McGregor and Josh Gad also impress.",8,2,2,17 February 2020
Hercules," I like the cast, but that's honestly about it
","The definition of a meh film, at least for me.'Hercules' doesn't stick a connection, I felt very unfulfilled throughout. I have little negatives, yet there isn't much the other way either. I like the cast, but that's honestly about it.James Woods, Danny DeVito and Rip Torn all give noteworthy performances in the roles of Hades, Phil and Zeus. However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.Bart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments. The animation is actually OK, satisfactory for sure.I can see this is very well rated by others, which I respect. For me, though, it isn't any good.",6,0,0,1 July 2020
Man on Fire," A very good action thriller
","'Man on Fire' is a very good action thriller. It certainly relies heavily on Denzel Washington's fine acting, and perhaps is a little overly twisty, but it nails what it set out to achieve - a fast-paced thrill ride.",8,0,0,9 January 2020
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The animation is simply incredible given it was released in 1937
","'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' never fails to impress when I rewatch it, the animation is simply incredible given it was released in 1937.Admittedly, it doesn't all hold up to an outstanding degree nowadays. The dwarfs still look fantastic, but Snow White herself and the world itself don't quite look exquisite; Snow White is rather dull, especially her facial expressions. I still have massive respect for those who created this though, obviously.The voice cast, as was usual in the early decades of Disney, are a little forgettable. Adriana Caselotti (White) and Lucille La Verne (Queen) do fine jobs, though it's Pinto Colvig who is most memorable as Grumpy.The premise is a pretty light too, with the main saviour hardly featuring and the antagonist disappearing for relatively large portions. Nonetheless, it's a great film to watch with family as Disney's first production is good fun - the music plays a huge part in that regard.",7,0,0,21 May 2020
Inception," A truly sensational film
","A truly sensational film. I hadn't rewatched this for years and almost forgot how outstanding it is.First of all, what a cast 'Inception' has. Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard and (albeit minor) Michael Caine. Tremendous performances from all of them.DiCaprio is always a great watch, he kills it in this production - the perfect person to play Cobb. Gordon-Levitt and Page are excellent here, despite being the two I'd (wrongly) assume would be the weaker performers. Hardy and Murphy are the opposite, I expected top level and they certainly gave it.Everything about this is astoundingly good. Christopher Nolan & Co. get it so, so right. The film is such a smooth ride in terms of following the premise, in spite of the roller coaster ride you experience seeing it play out. The ending is fantastic too, many films on this scale mess up the conclusion but they don't.If all that isn't enough, they even got Hans Zimmer to score the damn thing. Icing on the cake.",10,2,3,5 April 2020
The Secret Life of Pets," They could've executed it all a bit better
","I enjoyed the opening few scenes and the closing few scenes, but everything in between is a little meh.Plot is rather predictable, while the voice cast are a little dull sounding; despite doing solid jobs each. 'The Secret Life of Pets' isn't a bad film by any means, though I feel they could've executed it all a bit better.",7,0,0,4 January 2020
Finding Dory," 'Finding Dory' had a difficult task in following 'Finding Nemo'
","'Finding Dory' had a difficult task in following 'Finding Nemo'.It's not as great as the latter but it still does a very worthy job, which is what you want from a sequel. Ellen DeGeneres is terrific as Dory, her voice suits the character perfectly. I like a few of the new individuals, namely Bailey, though Hank doesn't quite work for me.",8,1,2,10 February 2020
Back to the Future Part II," Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are again superb
","Not quite on the same level as the original, but 'Back to the Future Part II' runs it pretty close.It no doubt heavily relies on Part I's exploits, though there's more than enough fresh material to keep things interesting. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are again superb, with Thomas F. Wilson also showing his prowess in this one.",8,0,0,30 January 2020
The Greatest Showman," I'm surprised to see the dislike this gets
","Simply phenomenal.I'm surprised to see the dislike this gets from some, especially as it seemingly only comes due to the fact it's popular, the creative license it uses and/or the real P. T. Barnum - strange things to judge a film on.'The Greatest Showman' features a sensational soundtrack, a fantastic cast and a gripping storyline. Musicals are probably my least watched/liked genre, but this film is outstanding.",9,1,1,25 February 2020
Casino Royale," A cracker
","This is a cracker. It is easy to see that 'Casino Royale' is a reboot of the series, as it feels fresher whilst still keeping the charm of 007.It isn't quite my favourite Bond, 'The Man with the Golden Gun' and 'From Russia with Love' (currently) surpass it, but Daniel Craig's debut is one to be proud of. He is excellent in the role.Mads Mikkelsen makes for a grand villain, certainly one to be remembered. Eva Green brings a good dynamic to Bond's female lead, while it was pleasing to see Jeffrey Wright; I always enjoy watching him.The plot is entertaining, I was thoroughly locked in during the poker scenes in particular. With that noted, the ending to this film is what marks it down for me. It concludes the main premise nicely, but the other parts felt like an add-on - which are finished a bit too sharpish.That is my only negative, as the rest is very good. I also appreciate how worldwide it all feels too... Bond is at its best when it shows off the world.",8,2,4,27 March 2020
Cinderella," My second favourite from their opening five animated offerings
","'Cinderella' is a good Disney film, my second favourite from their opening five animated offerings; behind 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.The first 30 minutes of this are a tad slow, though I can appreciate they are building up the character of Cinderella and portraying how poorly she is treated. Once they get that out the way, the film heads off in an enjoyable manner.Ilene Woods is solid in the titular role, though it's Eleanor Audley (Lady Tremaine) and Verna Felton (Fairy Godmother) who bring the best voice performances - they suit their respective parts perfectly. Jimmy MacDonald is notable as Jaq and Gus, also.You could argue that the famous glass slipper is flawed due to the time limit shown, while it would've been cool to get a deeper backstory on why Tremaine is the way she is - in fairness, there is at least some reasoning given.The maker's idea of what beauty supposedly is hasn't really aged well, but overall it's a charming production from 1950.",7,0,0,23 May 2020
Tarzan," It's a cracker
","'Tarzan' is one of those films that I had always assumed I had seen, though evidently I hadn't and this was my first time watching. It's a cracker!Phil Collins' music is tremendous, it truly adds a lot to the film - 'Son of Man', which I already knew about, is a great song which works very well with the montage. Some of the editing is rather sharp, while the animation is pleasing on the eye.Tony Goldwyn (Tarzan) and Minnie Driver (Jane) suit their respective roles nicely, as do Glenn Close (Kala) and Brian Blessed (Clayton). Rosie O'Donnell is the one I enjoyed most, as she portrays Terk - which isn't really a massive character, yet O'Donnell makes her memorable.It does feature things you've seen from earlier jungle based films, like 1967's 'The Jungle Book' and, as expected yet still amusingly, 1997's 'George of the Jungle'. The early scenes in-particular, which rely firmly on Collins' music - from the midway point it's more level, whilst also taking its own route with this type of story.I'm interested to find out where the two follow-up films go.",8,0,0,7 July 2020
Spectre," A delight
","'Spectre', Daniel Craig's fourth Bond film, is a delight.The opening scenes in Mexico City are particularly fantastic, though all that follows is just as grand. Craig is still impressive in the lead role. Christoph Waltz is in this too, I'm always happy to see him in a film - he as Oberhauser is no different. Dave Bautista is solid, he makes for a good brute-force assassin.Plot-wise it's enjoyable, I'm liking the hardened continuity of the story since the 'Casino Royale' reboot. It can feel a little overly entwined, but I think they've done a fine job tying things together.I look forward to watching 'No Time to Die' when that's released.",8,1,2,29 March 2020
The Nice Guys," Thoroughly impressed
","Great film. I was thoroughly impressed with 'The Nice Guys', from start to finish. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling work brilliantly together, but the supporting cast are all more than capable. It's beautifully shot. Quite a few actual laugh moments, too. I'd highly recommend.",9,4,5,19 December 2019
The Breakfast Club," Extremely good, entirely thanks to its fantastic cast
","'The Breakfast Club' is extremely good, entirely thanks to its fantastic cast who produce tremendous performances.Judd Nelson typifies that statement, he brings everything to the role of John which makes you feel for him despite his indiscretions. Ally Sheedy is also great, as she plays Allison - I already knew of her from 'Short Circuit' and 'WarGames', she's done some solid stuff. Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall all add heart and meaning with their characters.Other than the on-screen talent, it isn't really that great a production in all honesty. The message is brilliant and it deserves the plaudits it gets, but take away Nelson, Sheedy & Co. and it's a much, much weaker film.",8,0,2,15 April 2020
Pocahontas," Animation and music are the key parts
","Good offering from Disney.'Pocahontas' is an enjoyable flick from 1995. The animation is lovely, while the voice cast each do fine jobs. The premise raises noteworthy thoughts regarding British colonisation. It isn't perfect and isn't in-depth by any means, but I like what the film takes on.Irene Bedard does well in the lead role, while the seemingly ever topical Mel Gibson supports ably. It's also interesting to hear a young Christian Bale involved as Thomas. Billy Connolly appears too, though only minorly.The animation and music are the key parts to this. The songs aren't massively memorable but are catchy, the score is solid throughout but really comes up big at the end. Most of the humour, mainly with the animals, is fun too.Overall, it's a production worth watching.",7,0,0,25 June 2020
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandler is good
","Not as amusing as expected, but 'The Wedding Singer' is an enjoyable enough watch.Adam Sandler is good as Robbie, with Drew Barrymore fitting in nicely as Julia. They certainly do have noticeable chemistry. Christine Taylor (Holly) and Alexis Arquette (George) are decent supports, also.I had predicted extra laughs and, given how the film plays out, a more romantic feel to things. It's all fine though, I felt entertained to a satisfactory level. The music is well chosen, credit to Teddy Castellucci.I like Sandler and Barrymore better in 'Blended', but this production does leave positive thoughts.",7,0,0,10 June 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," My favourite of the first three films
","My favourite of the first three films.'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is much closer to the level that I expected from this franchise. It still isn't anything extraordinary, but it's certainly a more enjoyable ride.Harrison Ford, again great, is belatedly joined by a co-star who is on his level in Sean Connery. Ford and Connery are excellent together, raising the film's pedigree whilst also adding better humour. Even away from those two, the cast is a marked improvement as we see John Rhys-Davies return alongside newcomer Julian Glover.The plot is still the weaker part of Indiana Jones, at least to me. I wasn't really interested in the objective of The Last Crusade, not that I was bored but I wasn't overly engrossed; just like with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.There's still a lot of good to this though, particularly with John Williams' music once more. It has been a consistent if underwhelming trilogy so far, yet I'm still intrigued to see what 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' brings to the table.",7,0,0,17 April 2020
Back to the Future," It's an extremely well made film
","'Back to the Future' smashes what it set out to do, it's a thoroughly fun science fiction ride. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are outstanding.The film is actually pretty simple, that's not a negative - at all. I just mean in general, the premise itself is obviously complex but it doesn't delve too deeply into the scientific aspects. Again, not a bad thing.It's an extremely well made film.",8,0,0,29 January 2020
Goodfellas," If you haven't already, you gotta watch this
","This is great.My first time watching 'GoodFellas', but I had obviously heard massive amounts about it for years and years; especially after seeing and loving 'The Sopranos'. I was hoping it would live up to the hype and it certainly did.Ray Liotta is outstanding as Henry, it is fascinating seeing the story through his point of view. Robert De Niro is, for me anyway, the star of this however. Every single scene he brings his A-game, which I expected given how universally acclaimed that man is. Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also superb.The whole film is put together excellently, I specifically enjoyed the paranoia stuff late on with Henry & Co. My only critique would be the part of the plot with the FBI typist, which kinda came out of nowhere. It is part of the storytelling though, so not even close to a major complaint of mine.The pacing is tremendous too. It didn't feel like I had just watched a two hour plus production, which is always a pleasing thing but something you don't always get.If you haven't already, you gotta watch this.",9,0,0,31 March 2020
