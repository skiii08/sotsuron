Changeling," Overrated Overrated Overrated
","Why is this movie overrated? Two words: Angelina Jolie. She is wildly miscast. Those puffy lips are really distracting. But mostly I was annoyed at her smirking. Why is she sitting in the courtroom smirking? All she does through the movie is smirk! And say 'I want my son back!' We get it. I also get that Clint Eastwood is a bit of a perv. WHAT is with that long drawn out execution scene? My friend and I had to keep our hands over our eyes for about 10 minutes. But this movie loves violence. Note the fact that it is shown how the killer kept and killed the little boys but completely left out the real-life molestation of them. I mean, that would make the story (and it was) even MORE unpleasant but it's weird how the filmmakers decided to eliminate the 'sex' (such as it was) but leave in the horrid, horrid violence. I got the feeling that Eastwood and Co. really enjoyed the absolutely nauseating way these boys were eliminated.",5,6,15,29 December 2008
The Incredibles," Incredible Mediocrity
","Am I missing something here? When this movie came out last year everyone went on about it like it cured cancer. Well I just saw it on DVD. What is remotely new about this movie? Nothing. It's nice visually, but so what? I thought it was going to be a biting, snide and outrageous parody. Instead we get the same old family dynamics and boring 'be yourself' speeches.A few minor jokes about expanding waistlines do not carry a movie. And frankly, too much action leaves me numb and animated action even more so. The whole idea of the stay-at-home (not to mention incredibly NAGGING) mother was a bit tired. And I thought the black character was really insulting. Was it necessary for him to be a jive-talking stereotype? This movie is for people who actually thought Finding Nemo was good too.",1,41,124,15 March 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," He can act!
","Enough cannot be said about Jim Carrey's performance in this movie.  A wonderful movie, by the way, and everyone was excellent in it, but Jim Carrey really made the 'Jim Carrey' we all know disappear.  Will he be remembered by the time the Oscars roll around again?I would like to see this movie get nominated for best picture.  This is what great movies are about...not overblown epics with great visuals and no substance (you know what movie I mean!)  And speaking of LOTR, this film proves once again that whether he is a hobbit or a technical assistant, Elijah Wood cannot be trusted to get the job done!  Perhaps Wood should get more snarky roles like this.  He is so good at it.  I'd like to see him play someone truly evil.'Nice' to see a movie where even the tiny roles are so well-cast.  David Cross as Joel's friend Rob...hilarious as usual!",Null,0,1,22 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Must be a guy thing.
","Okay, first of all I will admit that I am not a big Tolkien fan.  LOTR is alot of tedious tripe disguised as LITERATURE.  Puh-leeze.But that said, I think the first 3 hours of this movie were pretty darn good.  However, the last 20 minutes were glacial.  Terrible!But what I really want to talk about is Sam and Frodo.  Why is Frodo the hero?  What the heck is Frodo for?  Frodo is the weakest, most useless little dweeb in the Shire.  Frodo would not get 10 feet without Sam.  Sam is the true Hobbit Hero.  Lord, I got so sick of seeing that swooning, ineffectual, fake-English-accented Frodo!Let's hear it for the 'fat one'!!  Sam could have gotten to Mount Doom alot quicker if he didn't constantly have to CARRY that panty-waste Frodo, or have to fight off giant spiders for him and whatnot.And wasn't that spider done really well?",Null,0,1,5 January 2004
Slumdog Millionaire," Enjoyable But Really Overrated
","Saw 'Slumdog' last night and wasn't terribly impressed. I enjoyed it for the most part but near the end I thought it got a bit tedious. Here are some other problems - Latika and Jamal (the older ones) seemed to have no personality. All this raving for Dev Patel's performance...well I just didn't see it. He was dull and so was the girl who played Latika.This movie is also VERY clich√©d. Cartoon mob bosses and the troubled brother that has to redeem himself in the end. Yadda yadda, like you couldn't see all that coming? The earlier stuff was much better and I enjoyed the first two 'Jamals' a lot more.Good ending credits, though!",6,4,19,29 December 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Bring a sack
","I am not sure if I can really review this movie since I didn't see the whole thing.  Yes, I am another one of those people who had to leave because of the ridiculous way this thing was shot.  Is it really necessary for filmmakers to do this?  It is not 'cool' or 'edgy.'  It is just nauseating. And I don't suffer from motion sickness.  It is a good thing that we were at a free industry-related screening.  If I had paid for this I would have been quite upset.SPOILER:  One other comment, from the part of the movie I DID see before I had to leave.  This concerns the part in the river when Marie is shot. Could we stretch credibility a bit more here?!  Just how much air did Bourne have in his lungs anyway?  He kept blowing into her mouth and blowing into her mouth.  He must of been down there five minutes!  Give me a break.",Null,0,1,24 August 2004
