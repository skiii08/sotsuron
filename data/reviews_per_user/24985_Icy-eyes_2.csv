Men in Black 3," Love It!
","I really enjoyed this film. The first thing that came to me, was it brought me back to my childhood. I am 19 now, and a visual effects student, and i noticed the old things, like 'oh! they used the same font!' and me and my friend sitting there singing the theme tune. If you loved the first two you will certainly love this one, as its a blast from the past, but mixed with the new technology makes it a great viewing in my opinion. I think it was great to learn all about Kay this time, and find out why he is his sinister self, and it brings back your love for all the characters.I thought the VFX were particularly good, which gave this film more aesthetically pleasing look compared to the previous ones which obviously, technology has advance to help them improve. I personally don't have any faults with it, though i think maybe i would pick up on something when i see it again, but the non stop action of it just, for me, keeps you engaged so well, that if there are any slip ups or faults, you don't really see it straight away. I feel that this film, was particularly great in 3D. Sometimes i feel films don't need 3D like Harry Potter was just pointless 'oh that tree is moving' but for this i thought it really made the viewing experience better and brought the feeling you should get, that you're about to get a spike through your face! Although i was surprised that it was a PG, but i guess with the alien fiction nature its fine!A Great family film, and a very good revival!",8,3,6,31 May 2012
Dark Shadows," Love It!
","As a 19 year old student that has always hated the 60s/ early 70s i found that this film changed my mind. I've always had a hatred for this era, mainly due to the Beatles, but the films use of more talented artists, such as the Carpenters and Alice Cooper, have made it great to listen to. I thought the film, was typical of Tim Burton, and if you're not a Burton fan, you're not going to like it. If you do, then i think you will love it. I have always been a fan of Burton, and his style. I am a Visual Effects student, and to me i find his style much more appealing that a majority. People complain about his constant type cast actors, BUT i think you'll find that its mainly due to a very good relationship between them all, and the fact the actors love to work with him, who wouldn't!?I've not seen the TV series so i cant comment on whether they were alike or not, but i felt this film had a really good rhythm to it. It brought back my love for Alice Cooper, and reminded me of my childhood learning guitar with a Glam Rock lover teacher. I thought it was very good paced, i LOVED the VFX for it, and thought it was a great horror/romcom which is an odd combination, but done well by Burton. I think that with any other actors it would simple not feel right. The great thing about Johnny Depp is his ability to morph into a different character and you completely forget about his other characters in other films, as a posed to the awful acting by Jack Black, who will forever be, Jack Black.A Great fun film that has really cheered up my iTunes! Good Old Tim!",9,1,3,31 May 2012
