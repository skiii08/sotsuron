The Blair Witch Project," Huh ?
","At most, an interesting film-school type project but hardly the movie this has been hyped up to be. Much of the film was just plain annoying - the characters were really starting to p**s me off (I wonder how the witch felt about them) or unbelievable (e.g. characters having major emotional confrontations while handing holding camera with great stability).Here's an idea.  Maybe AT&T should sponsor the movie, and after 5-10 minutes when you've got the concept (viz. kids lost in scary woods), they could have a reassuring deep voiceover with 'Next time you go to make a documentary in the woods, make sure you bring your AT&T Wireless Cell Phone with').Just a thought",3,0,2,1 August 1999
