Skyfall," Ian Fleming, Albert Broccoli, and Harry Saltzman Would Be Proud......
","And believe me, I do not say such words lightly. For fifty years, Bond has graced the screen, fighting his way through all sorts of situations involving a wide array of terrorists, assassins, criminals, explosions, weapons, exploding pens, hand to hand combat scenes, cars, and of course, beautiful women. After all this, can Bond still entertain us the same way? Hell yes he can and he proves it with 'Skyfall', a brilliant film that manages to include all the action and suspense that we are used to from bond while at the same time, adding a little bit of heart to the mix between Bond (the ever amazing Daniel Craig) and M (the great Judi Dench).The film wastes no time in getting started when Bond is forced into a high speed chase across Istanbul and is caught in the cross hairs and mistaken for dead after M is forced to make a split-second decision. But fortunately for her and for England, Bond doesn't stay dead for long because M's past is about to come back to haunt her in the form of Silva (Javier Bardem), an ex-spy and computer genius who can wreck a nation's economy (or worse) with just a the click of a mouse. Bardem plays the part with such evil zeal that I'm going to come out and say that Silva is probably one of the best Bond villains since Ernst Blofeld (aka Dr. Evil) himself. With his twisted laugh, smile, and feelings of anguish towards M , his character is one that you are likely to never forget. Its a race against time, across such diverse places like Shanghai, London, and Bond's homeland, Scotland, to save M and put a stop to Silva once and for all. The filmmakers are able to make good use of the shooting locations they are in, whether its the skyline and highways of Shanghai or the moors and hills of Scotland to really create an epic feeling for the movie, which is appropriate to mark the fifty years of Bond. Then, as with all Bond films, there are the women. On the one hand, we have the beautiful Naomie Harris who plays Eve, a fellow agent at MI6 who must decide if she wants to continue working in the field (an excellent surprise awaits us at the end) and then there is the stunning Berenice Marlohe, who plays the mysterious Severine, a woman forced to work for Silva. Both of these women do a stand up job in their performances and sex appeal. In addition, you have great supporting actors in the form of Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney, both of whom add a certain charm which makes the movie all the more better. I can't praise this movie enough; if you love James Bond as much as I do, you have to see this movie because not only does it move Bond ever further into the twenty-first century, it also gives us a little insight into Bond's origins, something that no other Bond movie has ever done. Further more, this film proves that Bond has still got it and no matter how much our world changes, he always will. Long Live Bond!!!!!",10,2,9,24 February 2013
Home Alone," Never Gets Old
","When it comes to enjoying that jolly time of year, there are several movies that must be viewed or else it just isn't Christmas. One of those is 1990's 'Home Alone'. Written and produced by the late, great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus, it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister (Played by Macaulay Culkin, arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple) who's constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large, extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role). On the eve of the big family vacation, Kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom (The talented and ravishing Catherine O'Hara) and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again. Little does he know, his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage, his parents' alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there's no tomorrow to catch that flight. Everybody that is, except little Kevin who's forgotten by everyone and as the title says, is left home alone. Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true.But it's not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves) are on the rampage in Kevin's neighborhood. Rather than running away like most kids might do, Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps. It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away, but there's something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year. To be sure, the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin's traps is nothing short of a laugh riot (Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps).But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it's pretty lonely, a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse, Old Man Marley (the late, great character actor Robert Blossom). John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least. On the contrary, it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty. And of course, who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else. With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness, we just can't help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film. I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy (Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin's mom in the back of the van!). 'Home Alone' is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it, it just never gets old. The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in, the 90's, a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else. It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever, much like the spirit of Christmas itself. So without further adieu, I urge you to watch this modern classic and if you're ever going on big trip with the family, make sure that you have all your children! Also starring John Heard and a host of other memorable actors. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!!!",10,5,7,17 December 2013
Cloverfield," Something Has Definitely Found Us..........
","And once the movie gets rolling, we really wish it hadn't! 'Cloverfield' is one of the rare cases in which the movie lives up to the hype. I remember when this was being advertised and how little the movie makers revealed in the trailers. However, for whatever reason, I didn't get to see this brilliant film until now(pretty sad, I know). But luckily I was able to fix all of that just now and can honestly say I'm a better movie lover because of it. Everything starts out innocent and normal enough with a group of friends throwing a surprise going away party for their other friend when IT arrives and as soon as it does, all hell breaks lose. Feel the tension as our heroes try to find a messing a friend while battling the ever growing chaos caused by the destruction of the visitor and the breakdown of all law and order. What is this visitor? Well, let's just say that it isn't looking to make friends, that's for sure! What makes the film stand out above everything else is the chilling realism that the filmmakers are able to incorporate into the movie, from the realistic shaking of the camera to the excellent performances of all the actors involved. The more down to the wire things get, the faster and faster our hearts beat. I wish I could say more but this is really one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better (and more bone chilling) it will be. Find it, watch it, and while you're at it, keep watching the skies!!!!",10,1,3,7 October 2013
American Sniper," Superb Tale of the Horrors of War and One Man's Experience
","It is very rare for me to experience feelings of such emotion and thought over a film as I have over 2015's 'American Sniper'. You probably already know it's about the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. history. And you also probably know that the likes of Michael Moore and Seth Rogen have denounced the film as being propaganda and a pro-war piece. Well ladies and gentlemen, nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, it is true that the film takes place during the Iraq war, and it is also true that the late Chris Kyle believed very much that the Iraq war was justified. But folks, this is not a pro-war film; this is a film that makes a valid attempt to show the full realities of war while staying true to Chris Kyle as much as possible. Before I go on, let me just say that I was not a supporter of the Bush Administration's decision to invade the present day country of Iraq (and ancient land of Mesopotamia). It didn't make sense to me then and it especially doesn't make sense to me now with all the tragedy going on in Iraq at the time of this writing. Be that as it may, I still believe we should honor the sacrifices of all those who served in that war and 'American Sniper' achieves this.The movie begins in the desert land of Iraq with Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper in a tour de force role) on a rooftop scouting for a column of Marines on patrol when he is forced to make a decision of whether to take out a young boy walking towards the column with a grenade or stand down? Then the film all of sudden gives us a peek into the Kyle's past, from his time as a boy to his experience at BUD/S to the meeting of his wife, Taya (the stunning Sienna Miller). From there the film provides as accurate as possible look at Kyle's four tours in Iraq and the subsequent affect they have on him and his family. Bradley Cooper, the lead man in the wolf-pack from the 'Hang Over' films, gives what may be his best performance so far. With his Texas accent and swag, bulked up appearance, and dogged dedication to the role, he doesn't just play Chris Kyle; he BECOMES him. Indeed, when I first saw Bradley Cooper in the previews, I didn't even put two and two together that this was the same man who played the lead role in 'The Hang Over'. His performance is that good! The same can be said for Sienna Miller in her role as Chris' dedicated wife Taya. With her dark hair, Texas charm and looks, she looked every bit like the late Chris Kyle's real life wife.Directed by the great Clint Eastwood, the film doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the ugly realities of war. When Chris Kyle kills someone, the camera doesn't pull away. We see people die from his point of view, and believe me it's not pretty. Eastwood should be congratulated for having the guts to make the film in the first place and do so without trying to sugarcoat for the audience. As one can imagine, seeing this death on a daily basis begins having an effect on Kyle's mind and family life and after his last tour of duty, decides to take the step of getting help. He does so by finding solace in helping other veterans who've seen the horrors of war by taking them out to the gun range, a decision that helps many but would sadly cost the life of Mr. Kyle. In short ladies and gentleman, 'American Sniper' is a film that anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, can appreciate if they go in with an objective mind, not one already made up. By showing Chris Kyle's experiences, the film shows the experiences of all men who go to war the subsequent challenges of reintegrating into society. A word of warning, though, the film leads up to an emotional ending in which it took every ounce of strength in me to hold back the tears. Whether you supported the war in Iraq or not, whether you are a pacifist or hawk, one thing is for sure: 'American Sniper' is one of the most powerful films of this year and is a must see for everyone who appreciates our military and their sacrifices. God bless all those who have served and may Chris Kyle rest in peace.",10,27,55,28 January 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," It's What An Animated Film Is Supposed To Be
","Did you ever see a movie that was so brilliant, so creative and ingenious, that you couldn't seem to find the words to fully describe it? Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's how I feel about 2012's 'Wreck-It-Ralph', an animated film where the whole family can be entertained. Meet Wreck-It-Ralph, a video game villain who's been doing the same act of destroying things in the same video game, in the same video arcade for the last thirty years. Being lonely and wanting to be a good guy for a change, Ralph decides to go on a quest to another game and the results, while chaotic for everyone in the video world, are a total blast for us. On his journey, Ralph encounters a variety of hilarious situations and characters, such as the feisty Vanellope, who like Ralph, also desires to be something different in her candy-coated video world. But they must hurry, for they are being chased by the goofy yet real villain, King Candy as well as an 'Aliens' inspired infestation of bugs that Ralph inadvertently brings with from another game. Luckily, help comes in the form of a tough as nails warrior, Sergant Calhoun, and from Ralph's game, Fix-It-Felix. There are many things that make this movie worth watching: the fact that the filmmakers are able to really capture the look and feel of the video game world with such fine detail and vivid colors, the inclusion of real video game characters as well as ones who were inspired by real ones, awesome music, but above all, in addition to having plenty of comedy, the movie has heart. Even though the characters may be animated video game characters to begin with, there are still moments where emotion hits you hard, such as the scene where Ralph is tricked into helping King Candy destroy Vanellope's car because he thinks he is doing it for her own good. It gets me every time and that's when you know a film has good writing. But a lot of the credit for the film's success needs to go for the actors who do the voices, such as John C. Reilly as Ralph, Sarah Silverman as Vanellope, Jack McBrayer as Fix-It-Felix, Jane Lynch as Calhoun, and Alan Tudyk as King Candy, plus, a whole lot more. To sum it all up, 'Wreck-It-Ralph' isn't just for kids; it can be for anyone who used to love going to the arcade, for parents who want to take their kids to a movie that's fun but has an important message, or just for anyone who might need a good laugh. Either way, don't miss this one. 10 out of 10.",10,3,4,10 March 2013
Jurassic World," Dinosaur Mayhem with a little Nostalgia Here and There
","Anyone who remembers seeing 'Jurassic Park' as a kid for the first time knew they were going to see the promised dinosaur extravaganza 'Jurassic World', no matter how good or bad it was. Luckily, I'm happy to say, the film was entertaining and it gave fans a little bit of what they always wanted to see: An opened and functional park that goes from being a dream to a nightmare! The story begins with two young boys - Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) - on their way to Jurassic World as special guests of their aunt, park curator Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). But, as you can probably guess, this isn't the best time for them to visit because soon, the park's new attraction, the genetically created Indominus Rex, will break loose and create, in the words of Dr. Malcolm, 'the essence of chaos.' With the the help of raptor whisperer Owen (Starlord himself, Chris Pratt!), does the group stand a chance? Lets start with the good. As someone who loved dinosaurs as a kid, this film delivers some of the best dinosaur action in years! The Indominus Rex is awesome looking, and as you probably know from the previews, this isn't your grandfather's T-Rex. It's highly intelligent, can camouflage, see in fared, and is something you don't what to come across (All the more reason why we should just go ahead and create it!). As the main villain of the film, the Indominus works as a constant and credible threat to the characters. Another dinosaur plus is the introduction of the sea reptile, the Mesosaurus, something that was never included in any of the previous installments. As for acting, I'd say everyone here did a good job, though the human star of the show is Chris Pratt. Channeling the cocky energy of his character from 'Guardians of the Galaxy', Pratt provides some of the humor relief as well as a center of sanity in an insane situation. So much so, Pratt does a good job making you believe his character is capable of actually training raptors. Bryce Dallas Howard also gives a decent performance of the uptight Claire (Some have said her performance was forced, but I thought it was okay) as does Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoskins, a man seeking to use the raptors and Indominus as military weapons (What do you think the chances are of that succeeding!). The two kids here are okay, and at least they're not annoying enough that we want them to get eaten. It also helps that the filmmakers include a little nostalgia here and there, whether it's the cameo of Mr. DNA in the visitors' center, the casting of B.D. Wong in the role of Dr. Wu (the only actor to appear from any of the previous films) or seeing the remains of the old Jurassic Park and one of those old Jeep Wranglers. As for bad, there were some parts of the film that felt kind of forced, such as in the beginning when they were playing the theme music and trying to capture the magic from the first film but didn't quite succeed. Another issue concerns the level of CGI used. Anyone hoping for some animatronic action will be disappointed, as their is only one scene that features it. While some of the dinosaurs looked good in CGI, such as the Indominus and the raptors, on others it looks a bit cartoonish. Case in point, the T-Rex. Supposedly, this is the same T-Rex featured in the first film but you wouldn't know that by looking at it! The thing doesn't look anywhere near as cool and threatening as it did in the first one, particularly because its head looks a lot smaller and is poorly drawn. For all the money put into this film, you'd think they could have done a better job with it. Another issue is the lack of explanation as to how and why the park managed to be reopened. We know that the park has been open for about ten years but the film doesn't really give much background plot, something that I was really hoping to see. All in all, while 'Jurassic World' is entertaining, it doesn't have quite manage to create that feeling of magic or awe that the first and even the second one were able to create, a magic you can still feel no matter how many times you watch them. Never the less, the movie is a big improvement over the third installment - which I don't think was quite as bad as some people said but no where near as good as the first two - and in the end, that's all we can ask. Either way, no matter how you feel about it, the movie's going to make a boatload of cash. If you're looking for some dinosaur fun and maybe even to capture some nostalgia of being a kid again, 'Jurassic World' isn't a bad way to do it.",7,4,17,15 June 2015
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," A Worthy Sequel To A Holiday Classic
","Normally, sequels to great films more often than not fail to live up to the first one, usually because the producers feel the urge to rush them out with whatever story they can glue together in five minutes without incorporating what made the original film great. Every now and then, though, sometimes Hollywood gets it right a second time. 1992's 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' is one such case. Taking place one year after the events in the first film, the cast once again includes the charming Macaulay Culkin as that devilish but lovable Kevin McCallister and pretty much everyone else, from Catherine O'Hara as the mother, to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the bungling thieves Harry and Marv. Once again the family is readying for another Christmas trip, this time to Miami, and like the first one, the alarm doesn't go off when it's supposed and it's a mad rush to the airport. Only this time, instead of leaving Kevin behind, Kevin manages to get to the airport but alas gets on the wrong flight after following a man who has the same coat, same hair style from the back as his father does! As you can probably guess from the title, Kevin ends up in New York, checks into the fancy Plaza Hotel with his dad's credit card (Were we are treated to a cameo from the Donald himself, Mr. Donald Trump, the owner of the hotel at the time) and living the dream. However, he won't be able to rest for long; Harry and Marv have busted out of prison and they decide to go to (Where else?) New York. Of course, it means another Christmas in the trenches as Kevin must prevent the two heartless but dimwitted thieves from knocking off a toy store whose proceeds are to go to the children's hospital. Can Kevin win again or are the tables to be turned?Although it may not be quite on the same level as the first one, I can honestly say I have just as much fun watching 'Home Alone 2' every year as I do the original. A big reason for this is probably due to the return of almost all the cast members, and I do mean almost everyone, from John Heard as the father to Gerry Bamman as the much hated Uncle Frank. Another reason is the return of Chris Columbus as director, whose shots of New York are as dazzling and enchanting as those in the first one. Indeed, Central Park has rarely been filmed as beautifully as it is here. Plus, the script is once again written by the late, great John Hughes, which means the story has plenty of laughs in addition to heart. True, the skits in this one are a bit more outrageous than in the original (In one scene, the film asks us to believe that a person, in this case Marv, can be hit with multiple bricks from a five story window and not suffer death or permanent brain damage!). However, folks, considering that this is a holiday comedy, I don't think it's too much to ask that we suspend our disbelief just a little. As for the music score, once again the legendary John Williams does his magic, producing what could be an even better score than the first, including new songs like the heart tugging 'Christmas Star', one of the most beautiful and underrated Christmas songs ever. In many ways, you could say 'Home Alone 2' is remake of the first one, only one that retains both the comedy and magic of the original version (Something that can't be said for any of the ones that followed it!). So, with all that said, gather around children and watch that most rarity of rarities, a truly magical sequel in the form of 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'. And, regardless of what time of year it may be, Merry Christmas!!!!!",9,1,2,22 January 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," It Truly Is A Wonderful Life
","In 1946, America, and the rest of the world for that matter, had just witnessed and won the most destructive war in mankind's history. They were trying to rebuild their lives from this and the Great Depression as well and as such, Hollywood got into the act by producing a number of movies that instilled hope in their audiences. Perhaps the greatest of these movies is Frank Capra's timeless film 'Its A Wonderful Life' staring the late, great James Stewart as everyday man George Bailey in small town America, Bedford Falls. George has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, longing to see the outside world but never able to get past the confines of the small savings and loans that he is in charge of. Then, one Christmas Eve, George's Uncle, Billy (played by the memorable character actor Thomas Mitchell) makes a terrible mistake that could ruin them both forever and George begins to think that everything would be better without him. It just so happens that heaven hears his and others' prays and sends an angel named Clarence (played by the understated but talented Henry Travers) to show him how wrong he is. In a Scrooge like role, we also have the great Lionel Barrymore in an excellent performance of Henry Potter, 'the richest and meanest man in town' and in her most famous role, Donna Reed as George's loving and devoted wife. This is a movie that will make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and leave you with a sense that no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. 'Its A Wonderful Life' is by far the greatest Christmas movie that has ever been produced and for that matter, will ever have been produced due to the time that it was made in and its message of how we all affect our fellow man, often times without even realizing it. So, I urge you to watch this movie and take in its message of hope and also, remember, no man is a failure as long as he has friends. 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,20 December 2012
Jaws," 'You're Going To Need A Bigger Boat '
","An Understatement if there ever was one. 'Jaws' (1975) is without a doubt, one of cinema's greatest achievements. Here you have what could easily be considered your standard B-movie material (not that there's anything wrong with that) that gets turned into a masterpiece by the one and only Steven Spielberg. The movie starts out innocent enough, a group of teenagers are hanging out on the beach, a young man and a girl decide to go off on their own. The girl wants to go swimming and the young man wants to accommodate her, however, he is clearly suffering under the effects of alcohol and doesn't make it into the water. Lucky for him, because shortly after the girl goes in, we, the audience, can clearly see that something is lurking under the surface and is getting closer and closer and then STRIKE, the girl is grabbed, whipped back and forward, pulled under again and again, and screaming for her life. In a few seconds, its all over as she is pulled down for the last time. From then on, we know that we're in for one hell of a ride. There are so many great things about this movie that I'm not even sure where to start. The acting is superb: there's the always reliable (and sadly, now deceased) Roy Scheider as Chief Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as the brilliant and sarcastic Hooper. However, the most brilliant performance may be that of the late, great Robert Shaw, who plays the hot-tempered but likable old fisherman Quint. Despite his enormous ego, you can't help loving him. In addition, there's Murray Hamilton who gives a great performance as a typical politician and Lorraine Gary in the role of the supportive chief's wife. The real star of the movie though, is the shark himself, who is created with a combination of real shark footage and a mechanical creation, which, while it may look a little fake in some scenes, still looks pretty scary after all these years. Filmed at the famous Martha's Vineyard, 'Jaws' is a movie that revolutionized the film industry by creating the summer blockbuster and made people afraid to go into the water. Oh, and who can forget the iconic theme by John Williams, a theme that has become so embedded in pop culture that every time anyone hears it, they know what it is. To put it bluntly, you are robbing yourself by not seeing this monumental achievement. Watch it and be afraid, be very afraid the next time you go into the water, because you never know what might be down there.",10,2,4,17 October 2012
Halloween," The Night Horror Came Home
","There are but a handful of movies in the history of film that could be said changed the very face of the horror genre forever. One of these is the 1978 immortal classic 'Halloween' as directed by horror master John Carpenter. Set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, IL, the plot is so well known that it's barely worth mentioning here, other than to say an escaped mental patient named Michael Myers breaks out of the asylum he's been kept in for 15 years for killing his sister to terrorize the town's teenage girls on, you guessed it, Halloween night. Although the plot may not be the most complex, the film is elevated by that right mixture of talent, timing, and movie magic. John Carpenter is able to take what might have been an average slasher into a bona fide horror landmark. Almost everything great about this film is owed to Carpenter and his team, be it the camera angles, atmosphere, mood, the decision to use a creepy doctored up William Shatner mask for the killer (a mask that has gone into the annals of movie legend) and of course, who could forget that creepy music score composed by Carpenter himself. Without that piece alone, the movie wouldn't be anything near as infamous as it is. This is the film that launched the careers of so many Hollywood big wigs, from Carpenter and producing partner Debra Hill to Jamie Lee Curtis, and even the stardom of classically trained British actor Donald Pleasance as Michael's tortured psychiatrist who, in all honesty, is just as important to 'Halloween's' success as John Carpenter is. This is the one, folks, the one that started the slasher craze of the 80's, the one that - for better or worse - launched the 'Halloween' franchise, the one film you must see every Halloween. Miss it at your own peril. Happy Halloween!!!!!!",10,0,0,1 November 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," What are people Thinking!
","Looking at all the praise 'Mad Max: Fury Road' has been getting, I am completely and utterly dumbfounded as to how so many people can be so blind. Me and a group of friends went to see this on the basis of so many people, including critics, praising it as a 'masterpiece' or an awesome film. Instead, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a complete and utter disaster and certainly not worth the $12 me and my companions spent. Why you ask? Well, for starters, the film doesn't explain ANYTHINHG to the audience. Yes, obviously we know this takes place in post-apocalyptic world and there's a guy named Max (Tom Hardy) who's trying to help a tough as nails driver named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) get a group of pretty female slaves away from some bad guy with a skull mask, some sort of breathing apparatus and a deep voice. Sounds kind of cool, except the film does a terrible job explaining a few things, like who the hell is he (His name's Immortan Joe but we only know that from a few times his name is spoken), why are some of his henchmen ghost white, what's with them needing blood, and why should we ultimately care whether our characters prevail against him or not? The film has absolutely no character or story development what so ever and the movie moves so fast that almost nothing sinks in. For example, other than Max and Furisoa, I don't think I knew any of the characters names in this film, much less develop any incentive to care whether they live or die. Me and my friends didn't feel any emotion from the characters predicament simply because there is no story or anything to care about. All they seem to do is drive around the desert and fight bad guys. That's it! Another fault is the fast-paced visions Max keeps seeing of his family, who apparently died but it's never explained how or why. After a while, the visions become annoying, ridiculous and fail to really add anything to the overall picture. It's possible that the death of his family was explained in the previous films but I only saw bits and pieces of the first one and that was years ago! The filmmakers seem to be operating on the assumption that everyone in the audience saw the previous films and that's an enormous mistake to make. If they wanted to reestablish the character Max, then actually do so by giving us a little background on him. Now, with all that said, the film did have some decent merits. Some of the car chases were pretty cool, admittedly, as were some of the vehicles themselves, many of them looking bad-ass. And the woman used as the models aren't bad to look at either.As for acting, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron do a decent job acting wise, though Theron's character seems to dominate the screen more than Max does and the film is named after him, right? These are the only reasons why I'm not giving the film a completely awful rating. But flashy visuals and awesome explosions don't make a movie people. If that were the case, Michael Bay would be heralded as the greatest filmmaker of our time. Yes, I know it's an action film, and you shouldn't go in expecting to see 'Citizen Kane'. However, you need there to be some character development and plot, even if its an action film folks and especially if the movie takes place in a fantasy or futuristic world to explain what's going on. To really put things in perspective, even the big, cheesy 80's action films with guys like Schwarzenegger, Jean Claude Van Damme, or Steven Seagal had far more character and story development than this did! And I'd also like to state that not only did neither me or my companions like this, but almost no one in the theater did either. After the last scene cut, there was complete and utter silence and I certainly didn't hear anyone praising it as we stepped outside. In fact, I overheard one guy saying if he could turn his Regal card in for cash! Bottom line, I love action films but I can't give thumbs up to a movie that doesn't give us any incentive to care about its story. If you're looking for a decent film, look someplace else and as for all those who are praising it, just how much money did the studio pay you to say those things!",3,27,69,15 May 2015
