Raiders of the Lost Ark," Snakes why did there have to be snakes
","One of my favourite films of all time. The storyline of Raiders of the lost ark is a thrilling and exellerating experience. Raiders is classed as one of Spielbergs best films (along with ET, Close encounters and Schindlers list). This film is the perfect way to make the world aware of the greatest adventurer of all time, Indiana Jones. The Ark of the covenant is the best possible object for Indi to try and take out of the armies of darknesses hands. This and the last crusade are the best of the now four Indiana Jones films with is mixture of love, adventure and action capped of by a brilliant cast. One of my favourite films of all time.",10,1,2,11 June 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Best Python by far
","The most hilarious film I have ever seen. It is funnier then some of the comedies we watch in todays day and age. I laughed throughout the entire film, especially at the line 'He's not the Masiah he's a very naughty boy'. All the characters are funny in their own different way. Like I say in the title this is the best Python by far, even over the holy grail and that also had me in stitches. The best scene is when Brian looks out of his window and sees this big crowd waiting for him because they think he is the Masiah even though he keeps saying he isn't. If there was a DVD boxset with the title best of British films this will definitely be in the collection hands down.",9,3,9,8 January 2008
City of God," Roller coaster ride through life in the favilas of Rio and its gang culture
","This is so far the only movie in a foreign language that I have seen, but I understood this film perfectly. City of God is excellent, mesmerising and in a lot of cases sad, sad because the only way these kids are going to make a living is through gangs and violence. However this is the story of a boy who leaves the gang culture and becomes a photographer by leaving the gang culture that killed his older brother. Overrall this a great movie, it captures the audiences attention by showing people in the richer countries (United Kingdom, America) what life is like on the streets of one of the worlds poorer countries (in this case Brazil).",10,1,3,9 June 2008
300," This is SPARTAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",This film is the perfect equation: History + Extreme violence = great movie.This film gave put me into a different perspective on what the ancient Greeks where like. The stuff I learnt at school was nothing near what happened in this film. Gerald Butler is brilliant. With some brilliant special effects and acting 300 has proclaimed itself as a strong contender for one of the best films of 2006 and 07. Each scene is shot in great detail considering the fact that the film is shot in brown and white with the occasional red for the colour of blood. Overall this is a Bloody but excellent film. By all means watch this film,10,2,4,9 June 2008
