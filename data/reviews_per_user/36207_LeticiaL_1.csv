Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A movie that reminds us all why we go to the movies in the first place...
","George Lukas has an imagination that is unparalleled. One needs to remember that before the graphics can even be created, George Lukas had to think up the worlds, characters, and scenery in his mind.  Though I was originally aware that the graphics were computer generated, I was quickly able to escape in the fantasy world he created. The graphics alone make this movie worthwhile.The story itself was impressive as well, though I felt it lacked some of the magic that the original movies were able to capture. The pod race, the fight scene at the end, and of course, seeing the old characters (much younger), were the scenes which best recreate that magic.  I believe this is not the result of a diminished script, bad acting, or loss of skill of Lukas' part, but the result of the fight between good and evil and the mysteries surrounding the force being a little more clouded and/or focused this time. It's hard to cheer for the good side when you know that Annikin will turn bad in future episodes. Also, with a better explanation of the force, it loses some of it's mystery. Despite this, the movie lives up to its hype.Overall, I thought the movie was absolutely incredible -- it made me remember why I go to the movies in the first place. The movie had George Lukas' signature all over it. In the span of two hours I cheered, sat tense on the edge of my seat, stared in absolute wonder at the visual feast in front of me, and felt my heart race throughout.  Like many fans who have waited decades to see this movie, I think the long wait was worth it and I look forward to seeing this movie once again. Bravo!",8,1,1,19 May 1999
