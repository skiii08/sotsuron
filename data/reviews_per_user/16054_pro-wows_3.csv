The Avengers," 8.8 Is most likely 'Cheated'
","There is no way this is legit 8.8. The movie is comparable to Transformers 3.(Rated a 6).Look I loved the following recent action hero movies. Spiderman (1-3), Dark Knight, Super 8, Iron Man(1-2), Transformers(1-2)I really don't dislike that many movies. I'm not being cynical. This movie really is just a cluster ..... There's no emotion to the whole thing. Its dull and flat. It also feels very 'PG'Its the definition of clich√© when it comes to super hero movies. There's no bar being raised, there is nothing new being done. The entire script is just a bunch of predictable non sense jargon with no meaning. There's no event in the movie where i go wow, that is original. Or go wow this movie gives me emotion and it really immerses me in the experience(Watch the beginning of star trek).My only thoughts is that Walt Disney Pictures did black hat tactics to hype this movie through social networks. I cannot and will not believe people think this movie is worth an 8.8.I really did want to walk out of the theater. This movie is forgettable and I was very disappointed and let down. This movie really just feels like another 'average' super hero movie. But the expectation of it being good just makes it worse.",1,649,1332,11 May 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Bait and switch
","Initially through advertisements you are shown clips of lots of nostalgic characters and themes. Ranging from Classic Arcade, NES, SNES, GENESIS and more. I'm into all of this stuff you think to yourself. I must enjoy this film. Let me help you understand what this movie is and isn't.This movie has a great 10-20min starting. Lots of classic characters, originality and some humour. If this movie were just a short of the first 20minutes then I would give it a solid 9/10.However after The starting 10-20min your put into a universe that feels like every other sub-par CGI animated film released in the last 6 years. Megamind, Happy Feet Two, Bolt.The movie devolves into an experience where you could care less about the movie or what is going on. Mind numbing action that has no real meaning or emotion behind it. Just a bunch of explosions and screams. You don't care about the characters and your just waiting for the movie to end.It's as if they made an abomination of a movie then realized how horrible it was and purchased rights from many IP's (Capcom, Konami) for the sole purpose of throwing into their trailers and advertisements but have nothing to do with the story line or past the 20 minute mark.It was clear that after the 20 minutes no one laughed at the poorly written script and no body was drawn into it. Looking around I just see people looking at their watches/phones waiting for the movie to end.This movie has to be the biggest bait and switch I've witnessed in my movie watching days.",4,22,63,4 November 2012
Bridesmaids," Surprisingly Disappointed
",Well if your a guy this is just another Chick flick just like all the others. Its watchable I Guess but there's nothing really funny about it. Some people compare it to the Hangover but with chicks and its not even close.What Disappointed me is that right when I thought the movie was going to get Good. It just went back to the same boring chick flick stuff. It stays the same the entire movie. The movie didn't even have a climax or a resolution. I don't know just really bad writing. A Stale chick flick.Anyways I mean what do you expect its clearly a run of the mill chick flick. A lot of critics point it out being funny even for guys. But I Don't know my girlfriend is really into chick flicks and even at the end of it she said it really wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.I give it a 6 because maybe its acceptable for females. The whole thing just feels amateur and uninspired. Trying to ride off of what hangover was but missing everything good about that movie.,6,1,2,25 September 2011
