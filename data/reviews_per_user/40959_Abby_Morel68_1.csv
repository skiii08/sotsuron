National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fabulous Sequel
","For a Sequel to a terrific movie, this is one that is well worth watching. It is not a 'trying too hard to capture lightning in a bottle' again. Nor, does it re-track over the previous movie.National Treasure, Book of Secrets manages to follow the formulae established in 'National Treasure' without walking over the same ground again.Ben and his friends and dad all end up hunting for another treasure. Plus, there's somebody else looking for it as well. As Riley says: 'It's the Axiom of Treasure Hunting: There's always someone else looking for the same thing.' If you haven't already seen it, be sure to see it. It's well worth it. Plus, with the 2 National Treasure movies, you can watch them out of sequence without sacrificing knowing what is going on in each movie. Neither movie is dependent upon the other to explain itself.(Postscript: In this one, we meet Ben's Mum!!)",8,1,1,7 November 2009
