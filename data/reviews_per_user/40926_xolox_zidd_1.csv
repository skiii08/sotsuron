The Avengers," OK we have made them desperate..
","To start with i new what to expect a lot of action involving hi-tech gadgets and weapons off-course stark(Downy Jr.) was excellent among the avengers with others acting tough and super-hero's unless there's an exception that is banner(Mark Ruffalo) when he was not the other guy. I think it couldn't have been done any better then this,like the cast itself being heavy and the expectations and hype added it has to be presented with perfection,apart from the loud bangs and crazy clashes between the avengers every other 5 minute which was quiet fun to watch indeed but the lack of story telling again over here kept me silent for a while and gaze only at the screen discovering in this case suddenly a stunt double instead of a black widow(Scarlett Johanson) now that kept me even more silent only later to learn the movie is full of error's here and there in the background but when the action in the middle is just to intense to observe the sides i know who cares.(i got bad seats BTW) the earlier reviews highlight the emerging and graphic part of the film which i must say were amazing and a lot of new stuff to see.To conclude in the end the movie is designed as a summer blockbuster with marvels best joining hands together and fighting the evil Loki who's job is to make people obey and worship him.So in the end a movie you would go to and enjoy from the start till the end only to walk out thinking...yeah! we have advanced in terms of making action/sci-fi movie",7,2,8,28 April 2012
