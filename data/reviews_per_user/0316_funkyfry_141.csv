Vertigo," Fear of space
","This one's been through the mill. I mean it, no joke -- every amateur and professional critic has had their crack at this film. If you piled up every interpretation, the film could mean just about anything and everything. You could also see it the way perhaps most of its original audience saw it, simply as a stylish suspense film with Jimmy Stewart playing a somewhat less savory hero than usual. But I'll go ahead and offer up what the film seems to say to me, without fear of repetition or hope of originality because there may simply be no uncharted territory where this film is concerned.Looking at the film's text first -- it should be admitted and recognized that this is in no way a 'mystery' film. The whole idea of what happened is revealed halfway through, just in case it wasn't obvious enough for some of the dunces in the crowd. It's an out and out suspense film, and the object of the suspense is the Stewart character and how he will react to the moment when he recognizes that Madeleine and Judy are actually the same person. I would say that in terms of the dramatic functions of the film, it scores perhaps a B plus. Throwing dollops of makeup on Kim Novak and making her look like some kind of gypsy didn't make me think she was a different person, and wouldn't be likely to make this former detective who Stewart is playing either.However there is a lot of very compelling subtext here. There's the whole implication of dopplegangers, the idea of the fluidity of identity which is common to a lot of 'noir' films. After all, it's impossible to talk about Madeleine and Judy being 'actually' the same person without realizing the irony -- Judy was never Madeleine, but Scottie (Stewart) can never look at Judy without seeing that other person. In the end he is psychologically confused, throwing a tirade in the defense of a 'Madeleine' who he never actually met and certainly never loved.There's this striking sense of a disconnect between past and present, intention and action, place and feeling. For example Hitchcock takes this lovers' stroll in Muir Woods among the redwood trees and somehow turns it into a scene of dread, as if the forest were haunted. There's absolutely no way for the characters to connect with that environment, and it produces a weird dissonance. Everywhere in the film, elements are being inappropriately juxtaposed: Marjorie's face on the portrait of the old Spanish lady, an older woman in a similar dress getting into Madeleine's car, the 'real' Madeleine being thrown from the tower and mistaken by Scottie for his Madeleine, in the film's final moments a nun of all things being mistaken for the angel of death. The point is never that these things are not what they seem to be -- after all, which Madeleine was the 'real' Madeleine, for Scottie I mean?",8,5,8,19 April 2009
The New World," Very interesting
","These days we're never sure if we're seeing revisionist history, or corrections to the revisionist history of past movie myth-makers. Terrence Malick and his collaborators made the interesting choice, in telling the tale of the Jamestown settlement, of avoiding details altogether and basically turning it into a totally immersive and impressionistic version of history. I have to say I like the movie overall, although it takes a bit of a nosedive in the last portion for me.Malick's representation of Jamestown itself is flawless as far as I can tell. I recognized the location as the exact copy of that part of Virginia, being raised in Virginia myself and having been to Jamestown many times, so I wasn't surprised to learn that it was filmed 5 miles from the original site of the colony. The amount of dedication and detail given to the Native American habitats and inhabitants is equal to that given to the English colonists. Instead of the kind of groan-inducing reverse-propaganda and revisionism that you see in films like 'Dances with Wolves', this film depicts the natives as very 'savage' but never lets you doubt that they had good reason to treat the invaders in precisely this way. It allows you to basically empathize with both sides. In a general sense, what was happening was a tragedy, the loss of an entire world of cultures. Yes, 'New World' is definitely being used here in an ironic sense. However by focusing on individual people like John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher) -- her name is never spoken in the film -- whose lives became entangled in the larger political consequences, the film manages to convey the sense that the moral implications of all these events were never cut and dried. There were never any heroes and villains, as this movie tells the story.The brilliant and dynamic camera-work in the film is often undermined, however, by inferior performances. Bale never seems to be interesting when he's playing a good guy. Kilcher is stunning to look at but has no real talent in acting. Her whole range of emotions is frowning and laughing. Worst of all is Colin Farrel, strutting about as if lost in some other movie where he actually is the hero. Oddly though, Farrel's character is the most appealing of the bunch. And I was pleased to see the often abused but very talented character actor Michael Savage popping up in a couple scenes.I'm actually glad I saw this on video, because I think that the pure visual excellence of the movie would have overpowered me in the theater and I might have been tricked into thinking it was a great movie. It is a good movie, but far from great. I recognize and respect the fact that the producers and director took a lot of chances with this movie, and I wish that more films were made this way. However the results are not always 100% convincing or appealing.",7,1,3,8 June 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," stupid isn't always funny
","I was hoping for something more from this movie, having seen some of Sacha Baron Cohen's other stuff and having heard lots of good things about the film from friends. There were a couple of funny scenes but overall the movie was boring and predictable. It seems stuck in that sort of Tom Green mentality, stupid + offensive = funny. Cohen's shtick is basically that he's supposed to be from one of the former Soviet Republics, and he likes to see how far he can push 'regular' people (most of whom seem to be actors) before they drop politically correct facades and get angry at him. I think the idea is that he is sort of making everyone else ridiculous, and it's true that there's almost no way to retain your 'cool' if you were confronted on the street by someone of 'Borat's' ilk. But any kind of political or personal revelations in the movie are highly suspect.It's funny to watch him exhort a rodeo audience to 'destroy Iraq, kill all living things' and so forth, but the guy is just so far over the top that it's impossible to believe that anyone really takes him seriously. He needs to play it a bit more straight in my opinion in order for it to be really funny. With the 'frat' boys, for example, you could see it as Borat conning them all into revealing some of the casual ugliness of their lifestyles. That is, you could see it that way if you were really naive and you didn't think that Borat's act is so outrageous that the guys in the movie were just sort of playing along with the general craziness.In my opinion it's not really worth seeing.",3,4,9,15 February 2008
3:10 to Yuma," solid Western action
","I didn't find the movie as fun or compelling as the original '3:10 To Yuma' basically because the villain wasn't quite as ambiguous and the characters weren't given as much time to develop. Luckily I haven't seen it in quite a few years so I was able to watch this re-make with much the same attitude as someone who hadn't seen the original. It's a satisfying film in and of itself, probably the most solid Western I've seen in the last few years (though I know I did miss a few chapters in this seeming Western Renaissance). The original story is by Elmore Leonard, and this film succeeds IMHO largely because it doesn't try to muck it up or modernize it too much. Other than the female protagonist (Gretchen Moll) the wife of the hero Dan Evans (Christian Bale), none of the characters feel like 21st Century people walking around in the Old West like so many newer Westerns do (and frankly, a lot of 40s/50s Westerns feel like people from the 40s walking around in the Old West. So it's a bit of a universal complaint regarding the genre). She has a line where she has to say 'We're supposed to make decisions together, aren't we?' that really seems odd in the context of an 1860s frontier family if you know what I mean. Other than that, it's all pretty much authentic feeling as far as that goes.A brief summary: Evans is a farmer who's about to lose the family farm to debt, so he agrees to help bring outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to another town where he can catch the 3:10 train to Yuma where he will be imprisoned. Evans' son William (Logan Lerman) decides to set out to help him because he doesn't think his dad is enough of a man to accomplish the task.You'd expect that the boy would just get himself in trouble and quickly be in need of rescue, so the film earns itself extra points just for avoiding that cliché. However the development of the general angle of the son, father and outlaw is handled in a pretty predictable way. Because the performances are good, it all works and becomes very sad by the end when tragedy strikes. Lerman's work is very good for a juvenile actor and he looks a bit like the young Christian Slater. The story element with the 3 of them evokes some memories of the classic 'Shane' with its domesticated man and gunslinger competing in the boy's mind for respect. In fact the movie is far more than most newer Westerns which just go through the motions of the Old West ritual (or Leone's great films, which make ritual itself the centerpiece)  the story engages many of the classic Western themes including the individual vs. society, physical might vs. justice, etc.I also greatly enjoyed Peter Fonda in the movie; he's aged into quite a solid Western character actor at this point in his career. The scene with his death was one of the more striking in the film, although I couldn't help wondering why they didn't tie Ben Wade up better considering he kept escaping and killing people. There are a number of compelling action scenes in this film, in contrast to the original which as I recall really only had the tension building up to the exciting scene where Evans leads Wade to the train. In this one we have a very nice scene where the good guys actually have to rescue Wade from a vengeful railroad baron and a thrilling stagecoach robbery in addition to the climax.In the final analysis, I still think Bale has yet to prove to me that he is a compelling actor. He's never embarrassing or unconvincing but I always find him nothing more than serviceable. Crowe on the other hand I haven't seen much of over the years but he really impressed me in this film; I can see why he's such a popular star. It's easy to see why William is enchanted to some extent with him, and the fact that Crowe has so much more screen presence than Bale actually does benefit this film and fit the characters. This is a Western that seems to accomplish the impossible  it will not bore young viewers addicted to fast editing and constant action, but it will also not offend those with more traditional tastes in Westerns. The music is stand-out as well, eschewing the modernist tendencies of newer Westerns like Dwight Yoakam's 'South of Heaven, West of Hell' but also not feeling completely out of place in a newer Western. I would say this is a solid production all-around and will satisfy the hunger for Westerns for those like myself who feel seriously under-fed by Hollywood these days.",7,3,7,5 November 2007
Spartacus," The great director cannot save this film
","Spartacus is one of those movies that's wonderful to look at, but completely lacking in real substance or gravity. As historical entertainment it beats anything on the History channel or for that matter most epics of its type. The production is excellent, some of the best matte work I've ever seen and some very nice costumes and settings.Then you have a cast which includes some of the great names in film -- perhaps gathered under the concept that the best way to simulate the Roman Empire is to stuff your film with venerable British stage actors. Here we get a U.K. all-star team including Charles Laughton, Lawrence Olivier, Peter Ustinov (and Herbert Lom for bench strength). I thought of the trio the best work was done by Laughton, whose character has surprising dimension. Ustinov does some nice work as well, and I really enjoyed the scene with he and Laughton at the end where they discuss Ustinov's newfound dignity. 'Add some courage to that dignity' urges Laughton's character. I think Olivier's character was misconceived, and the attempt to give his character dimension by having him fall in love with Spartacus' wife (Jean Simmons, the female U.K representative, saddled with some of the film's most ridiculous dialog and scenes) falls flat for me. It's not a case of poor acting by Olivier but of poor writing. Kirk Douglas is all swagger as Spartacus. He's a poorly developed character. I can't imagine what they were thinking by giving us a central character in this story of corruption and intrigue who was basically a saint. The character is nothing but a walking Romanesque imitation of Abraham Lincoln, all speeches about human dignity and freedom. He's given a girl to sleep with but it's beneath his dignity to make love to her with the Romans watching -- as if Spartacus would be aware of any other way to do it. Basically the character is a walking anachronism; he's like a 20th Century union organizer dropped into the Roman world.Most of the blame for this film's failure should fall on Douglas' and Trumbo's heads. It's well documented that the director, Stanley Kubrick, wanted to change some of the dialog but he was not allowed to do so. Perhaps Douglas mistakenly thought that allowing script alterations would dull the glory that he hoped to gain by bringing Trumbo back to Hollywood as a reclaimed 'genius'. Presumably Douglas' courage in embracing the blacklisted author was supposed to mirror his character's saintly pro-freedom stance. This film emerges as a fable instead of a real story, because no intelligent person could possibly believe that Spartacus had no desire for revenge against the Romans in his heart and that he had somehow sidestepped 1500 years of social and political philosophy to come to a post-Lockian understanding of the essential equality of man. Yet it takes itself far too seriously in the way it presents its history to be acceptable as a historical fable.Compared to other 'epics' of the sword and sandal variety, this is a good film. But that's not saying much IMHO. Compared to other films by Stanley Kubrick, this is an awful film. The only parts that even feel like a Kubrick movie are the battle scenes where you can see Kubrick's love of geometry and strategy in the overhead shots of the columns and phalanxes moving across the field. The gladiator scenes are also well directed though less distinctly 'Kubrickian'. But there are about a half dozen dialog scenes between Douglas and Simmons and I think this is where the film really bogs down -- although there are other problems such as Tony Curtis' poorly developed poet character. The scene with Olivier and Curtis is just embarrassing. We have this erotic image coupled with wretched dialog about how the Roman likes to eat snails AND oysters. The conversation is played as if it should be subtle but the dialog would only seem subtle to a 10 year old.I think out of all the muck and drek that this movie presents, the over-arching issue that I have with it is that it presents a morally simplified universe, yet pretends to be morally complex. The film presents absolutely no doubts about the moral righteousness of Spartacus' violent crusade and shows us former slaves who are so docile and get along so well that at times you feel like you're watching a beach party movie instead of a movie about a pre-Christian slave rebellion. One longing for the kind of moral ambiguity found in classic epic films like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or Kubrick's own 'Barry Lyndon' will be sorely disappointed. This movie is just 'pomp and circumstance' -- well done as an action film, but with only the appearance of depth.",6,6,11,13 February 2007
Casablanca," Movie Magic
","Suspenseful and romantic noir of the 'nice people stuck in exotic paradise with a bunch of thugs' variety rises above its genre and its propagandistic aspects with tight direction, beautiful photography, an engaging story, and one of the best casts ever.  Bogart and Bergman's doomed love story is very effective, and there are some nice suspense scenes and very crisp dialogue in the best WB tradition.  Lovely to look at and enter into, Casablanca is to be experienced again and again in doses large and small.",10,0,1,7 October 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," nothing special for me
","I never liked the movie when it came out, so please don't be surprised or disappointed if I don't have a lot to say about it this time around either. I watched it again even though I have a longstanding dislike of Robert Zemeckis' movies just because I enjoy Bob Hoskins and I like the idea behind the movie of mixing animation and live action in a period story. I thought maybe it would have aged well and that I might enjoy it more this time. So anyway rather than belabor the point let me just list a few of the things I liked and disliked and leave it at that. Start with the bad news, eh? I disliked Christopher Lloyd as the villain in fact I always dislike Lloyd when he plays a villain. Who keeps casting him this way? He's not scary and it robs him of the chance to be funny. Probably Zemeckis just wanted him in the movie because he was so popular in 'Back 2 the Future.' Sorry to Charles Fleischer because I've heard he's a great guy, but I have never cared for his voice work as Roger in this movie and basically the animation doesn't blow me away either. I never understood why they had a rabbit in this movie instead of making up a more original animation because it always felt like a retread of Bugs Bunny to me.There's not much of a plot or a mystery here either, considering how much screen time was devoted to it.OK, I do like some of the cameos by classic animated stars from 'Bugs' to Betty Boop. I liked when Hoskins first rode into Toontown, or maybe it was the second time, and was greeted by all the smiling animals and the smiling sun. Very strange. Bob Hoskins was fine in the role. Joanna Cassidy is a favorite of mine, with some of the most gorgeous shoulders ever seen on the silver screen and a great personality to match. Sad to report though in this film she doesn't really get to do anything memorable.It's probably more to fun to watch for people who are more into classic animation than I am. Basically I've just always felt that it's a gimmicky film and that it really doesn't have much heart and soul.",5,4,12,19 November 2007
Minority Report," Only a minority of the audience seemed to enjoy this one
","Some effort WAS made to do a good sci-fi movie, despite the disappointing result.  A big part of the problem has to do with the fact that Spielberg can't seem to make an honest to god sci-fi movie (I haven't been able to bring myself to see A.I., so I'll reserve judgement on that one, but I have my suspicions...., and Close Encounters isn't my sci-fi cup of tea for sure).  The characters can't be motivated primarily by fear, nor do any of the issues of political infighting from Dick's story emerge strongly, but we do have a dead kid.  That's Spielberg's answer to everything:  throw in dead kids.  Well, it's been working for him for a long time (from 'Jaws' to 'Shindler's List') so I guess he'll keep doing it until people stop pulling on their own heartstrings so hard.Yes, that's this movie's excuse for a plot motivation (Dick's story had a political motive behind the murder in the majority report).  Instead of being good science fiction, it just becomes another dumb shoot 'em up movie. It has great special effects, like all these 100+ million dollar movies do, but that's getting to be kind of standard-issue these days.  This movie needed a compelling story to make the effects and this vision of the future seem special, and it didn't have one:  all it got was this dead kid.  Over and over again, Tom Cruise mourning and stalking around his apartment because of a dead kid.  And of course it turned out that Max Von Sydow was behind it -- anybody who's seen any of these movies will expect that Sydow or Christopher Lee or Ernest Borgnine or whoever it is will end up being the bad guy.  No wonder when I saw it at a theatre in Berkeley CA I saw (and heard) at least five of the fifty or so people in the audience sleeping.  In the middle of the afternoon.  Yes, this film is siesta time.Of course, it's not all bad.  But it's got enough good stuff (good ideas from Dick's story, good actors like Tim Blake Nelson and Colin Farrell and, come to mention it, Tom Cruise) to make the pretentious, obvious film that emerges seem even worse because of it.Is it a coincidence that Spielberg's now working with Tom Cruise, the last male lead in Stanley Kubrick's last film?  I was amazed to discover that after Stanley Kubrick died, Spielberg was suddenly his best friend and wanted to make the movie he COULD HAVE made with Kubrick 7 years ago instead of 'Jurassic Park 2'.  Of course, I don't really blame Spielberg for not wanting to direct a movie under Kubrick's production -- nobody really knows what that would have been like.  But now he's making Kubrick's movies and working with the last actors he worked with.  It's like some kind of sick hero identification, or midlife crisis or something, and somebody who cares about Spielberg should talk to him and tell him to make his own movies -- if he has any.  It seems like his whole career he's been in the shadow of others (Jack Arnold, and now Kubrick).Also, I'm getting a bit tired of all these movies going for the same urban/gothic/exotic look that Bladerunner established in the 80s.  This film is one of the poorer ones to try so far -- the only one I've seen that does it with any success is the mid-90s 'Dark City.'  I think sci-fi fans are getting a little sick of seeing this look over and over again -- I mean, enough with the cyberpunk hair cuts and fancy holographic photo equipment, if I wanna see it I'll take out my DVD of Bladerunner.  I'd rather just keep watching one good movie than a bunch of imitations.",4,5,9,10 October 2002
Finding Neverland," A bit over-sincere, but well done
","I didn't really think of the film as anything exceptional, neither exceptionally bad nor good. The production was excellent, all the actors including even the children were top notch. I think the story kind of simplified some things that should have been left more up in the air, for example Julie Christie's mom character was too evil and one dimensional in the early parts of the film and then her transformation was handled much too quickly to be convincing that she actually came to like Barre in any way. Even more so with the author's wife, who fluttered about on the periphery of the film never really being given any meaty scenes, and then brought back for closure reasons in the middle of the finale. She barely even qualified as 2 dimensional though I would blame it on the script and not the actress. I thought the scenes with Depp and Winslet were well done, just restrained enough to be realistic to the time period but also to convey their mutual feelings that go beyond respect or just affection.I got the feeling that if this had been a film about one of my favorite writers, I would have loved it. It was very much a tribute -- I can't even remember ever seeing Depp play such a 'good guy'. Maybe that was part of the problem, I don't know. In the end it was nothing special for me.",5,1,5,29 June 2006
In Bruges," OK, nothing special
","I liked this movie; not enough to say it's some kind of great film (it's basically a less glossy variation on 'The Matador' from a few years ago), but it's different and intelligent. Colin Farrell plays a newbie hit man who messes up his first assignment, and Brendan Gleeson is his friend who brought him into the organization and is tasked with bringing him out of it by the brutal kingpin played by Ralph Fiennes.As I say some elements seem to remind me of other movies which is how I take this movie down perhaps a few points. The buddy movie hit-man thing was similar to 'Matador', and Fiennes' whole character, role in the story, and even his performance was a bit too similar to Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast' (which is a much better movie). However this movie of course was different because it was.... in Bruges. The novelty of the setting wears a bit thin and at that point so does the movie, although not tediously so. I think that some of the characters were too arbitrary to really hold any weight, especially the drug-dealing girlfriend character. They're really just fantasy fodder for the teenage audience that wants to feel sophisticated watching a European movie.Ultimately it's a good movie because Gleeson and Farrell are so good together, that they create some moments that are different and interesting to watch. But it all degenerates into silliness by the end.",6,3,8,28 June 2010
Chinatown," fantastic film
","This is one of the most exquisite 'new noirs' to come out of Hollywood in the past few decades. The story, a deceptively simple narrative about water rights in Los Angeles of the 1930s, points a cold finger at the heart of Hollywood itself. Jack Nicholson is dynamite as the crafty P.I. hired to take out dirty laundry who gets himself caught up in the mess.I've never been a huge fan of Faye Dunaway in this film, but John Huston as the villainous Noah Cross more than makes up for any sentimentality on her part. He plays the role with his whole body and soul, really making us believe in this person, which is what makes his character so uniquely terrifying in film history. The director Polanski himself makes one of the film's most memorable guest appearances as a 'midget' goon who takes a knife to the hero's nostril.'Chinatown' itself is the place where Nicholson's character Jake Gittes used to work the beat as a legitimate cop -- the name and the place are hovering like a ghost in the margins of every scene of the film. It symbolizes both Gittes' lost idealism and a kind of place where evil inevitably wins. It's a dark undercurrent running through the film unseen until the climax. Basically I think the film is about how little of what's happening that we're actually able to see, at least at first glance. Thus the role of the detective becomes, as it does in most of the great 'noirs', a metaphor for the role of a living person generally. What lies beneath is something that we might have been better off not knowing about; something we're powerless to fight because it's rooted in human nature itself.",9,1,2,23 November 2009
I'm Not There," A near-total disaster
","Oh we must be truly sated indeed with the standard-issue biopicture, with its patented and trademarked rise to glory and fall into drugged ignominy with phoenix-like rebirth, to accept a sorry film like this as some kind of precious alternative. This is a film that promises to tell us something about Bob Dylan, but instead presents a semi-impressionistic series of unrelated images that are supposed to represent various facets of Dylan's personality and public image. What we end up with is probably the most indulgent rock film since Roger Waters' 'The Wall.' Along the way, a pair of fine performances by Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett are used as grist for the mill. When Blanchett is on screen, we want to watch, but she doesn't tell us anything either because she's acting out the most enigmatic portion of Dylan's life. On the other end of the extreme there are these laughably nonsensical scenes with Richard Gere riding around on a horse surrounded by images taken from Dylan's more obtuse lyrics. And Christian Bale's performance here is a laugh-out-loud mistake. It's surely a very beefy and well-fed Dylan we're looking at there.You've got a director who wants to be the equal of Antonioni, and he has indeed succeeded in making a very superficial movie about the superficial. So I'd give him credit there -- his film is just as pointless to look at today as most of the 'art' films of the 60s and 70s are. Basically all the weight of all this artistry and technology is being put to task on Dylan, a man who in and of himself would be of little interest if it weren't for his music.Some of the most interesting ideas in the movie come out of the least effective scenes. For example, the idea of portraying some version of Dylan as a little black child is a disarming symbol -- is it supposed to tell us about how Dylan once saw himself, as a new Woody Guthrie, or about how the public wanted to see him? As he sits on a porch and sings 'the blues' with a pair of rather typical Hollywood country black folk, the music emerges with studio clarity. The words ring out, 'The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!', and no words like these were ever heard on a back porch in the South. Is this a statement on how in our quest for authenticity, we accept the post-modern as the authentic tradition? Or is it simply trying to pass off the young Dylan as an authentic folk voice? Ultimately it doesn't matter because the scene itself is so cloying and annoyingly slick.Basically, you have to care a whole lot about Bob Dylan as a person, you have to think he's some kind of mythical personality, to accept this movie. If you don't think Bob Dylan is all that important, then you're going to wish you had these few hours of your life back. They would be much better spent watching 'Don't Look Back' or 'Hard Rain', to see the real Dylan doing the things that actually made him famous and popular. The man was an entertainer, not a prophet. The film seem to want more than anything to make exactly this point -- and yet it drapes the man and itself as cinema in so much deliberate obscurity that clearly in the film's heart it wants to hold onto the mystique more than it wants to open up any truth for us.",2,7,10,15 November 2009
The Big Lebowski," One of the Coen's most inspired comedies
","One of the Coen's most inspired films, this one draws on at least 3 different genres as it weaves its amusing tale of a confused attempt at blackmail that gets mucked up by the unintentional involvement of loser ex-activist Jeffrey Lebowski (Bridges, at his best). Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi make a congenial trio, seeming at home in the bowling league they seem to live for, and Turturro makes a surprising and memorable appearance as 'The Jesus'.  The dream sequences, a Coen staple, were never more fitting or more funny, particularly when Lebowski goes from his flight over L.A. to a Busby Berkeley-esque production line full of Viking women led by Moore's dominating heiress.  Even to its last bittersweet moments, this is a memorable dark comedy that brings all the Coen's best elements to the fore.",10,1,2,3 August 2003
Fight Club," Engaging and perplexing
","I don't know how much of a full 'review' of this movie I can actually write based on one viewing, most especially as I was rather extremely hung over at least at the beginning of the movie. But actually I think that's not a bad way to watch it. This is quite an ambitious film, a lot of themes and ideas are being tossed around in the film that aren't directly anchored to the characters. Or the character as the case may be. I did really like the movie, but I thought that at times it got too slick with its presentation. It suffers from the same faults as all action films despite being a satire of action films on a certain level -- the action simply can't be intense enough to hold the hardcore audience's attention in the beginning and still ratchet up to something even more grotesque without becoming completely unreal and potentially laughable in and of itself. But you could say the same thing about some of Paul Verhoeven's best action satires like 'Starship Troopers' that weren't even as clear as 'Fight Club' about actually throwing the macho ethic into question. It seems to just go with the territory.So in some respects this film belongs to the same school as films like Aldrich's 'Kiss Me Deadly' or Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' in that it's a kind of theater of excess, basically throwing macho types out there and not so much deconstructing them as just pushing them so far over the edge that they already appear hyper-real. But I think the film sort of betrays that in some of its last sequences. That's the kind of thing that I think I'll be able to say later after I've seen it again. I do want to watch it again because certain scenes, especially the ones with Helena Bonham Carter (who I always WANT to like more than I usually do), are really appealing for some reason.The thing that holds me back from embracing the movie is that it just seemed a bit too proud of itself, and the story was a bit too ridiculous even in the end when all was explained to actually take it as seriously as it seemed to want to be taken. I'm going to see what I think ultimately though at some later point. This is the type of movie that might either go up or down in my estimation when I have a better handle on it.",7,2,4,12 April 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Exceptionally poor effort at pornographic sadism
","I really don't like this movie. I think right now I'm rating it like a 2 or 3. I haven't seen 'Death Proof' but I think I've seen all the other ones he's directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was 'Jackie Brown' as far as I'm concerned. I'm pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way. But this movie and 'Kill Bill', these are just stupid movies to me. Pornography of violence basically.There's something to be said for the old exploitation movies. I'm not entirely ignorant on this subject. He used a lot of ideas from the B-crime movies of the 50s with 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs', and then he did I guess his version of 'blaxpoloitation' with 'Jackie Brown.' But the thing is, that movie was made with respect to black people. It's not even really a blaxploitation movie at all, just a decent modern caper movie that uses music from the 70s movies. But with this 'Inglorious Basterds' thing, it's really like he's trying to make his own 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS' movie. But he's trying to have his cake by making it 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the Jewish resistance.' And ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character and every scene is dehumanized and dehumanizing. If he had actually wanted to make a movie that would have entertained Hitler, he couldn't have done better.I want to give this movie points for being different, but how can you reward somebody just for being worse than others, for daring to go further into violence for the sake of violence and justifying it with some lame-arse stuff like 'oh they're all Nazis, who cares what happens to Nazis?' It's still dehumanizing in my opinion, it debases us to be encouraged to fantasize about committing this kind of violence to anyone. Movies like this are what makes me scared for the future of America, which I love dearly. Don't try to say that the 'Basterds' are presented in some kind of negative light, or the film is a parody of American Exceptionalism. That's just an excuse that Tarantino built into the film with a few throw-away lines like 'watching the Jew Bear bash a Nazi is the closest thing we get to a movie.' Just to be self conscious about using violence and hate as a cinematic value (like the most base and disgusting exploitation films Tarantino apparently adores in a different way than I ever could) is not to justify it, not even in an aesthetic sense.",2,18,32,28 June 2010
Iron Man 2," Lame follow-up to mediocre movie
","I'm not a huge fan of this series..... the first film started out exceptionally poor with horrible racial stereotypes and ridiculous effects, then entered an interesting and entertaining middle stage that dealt with anti-hero issues, and concluded in a predictable underwhelming confrontation. The sequel has a more exciting battle at the end, but very little before it to really keep me interested. From its first moments it presents a cliché landscape of cgi robot action, PG-13 level exploitation values, and absurd character relationships.The new writer, Justin Theroux, has produced a film that plays even more to the lowest common denominator, which is quite surprising considering his public persona as a fringe badboy in terms of acting (he's appeared in many David Lynch films, among others). The film lacks any sense that there's a larger structure hanging over the proceedings. About the only ongoing plot is the idea that Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is sick/dying and that Pepper Potts (Paltrow) doesn't know about it. Everything about the film is designed not to exceed the capacity or appetite of 14 year old boys. Theroux is clearly primarily a comedy writer, as evidenced by his only previous credit on 'Tropic Thunder' (a much more entertaining Downey Jr. film and performance).The worst thing about films such as this, and the Pirates of the Caribbean films with Johnny Depp, is that they have proved that the best actors of our generation can be debased and turned into engines for boring action franchises. There was a time when serious actors wouldn't go near a kiddie movie like this. While Downey Jr. provides much of the film's humor, you have to feel like he's wasting his own time as much as ours. Mickey Rourke, after a nice performance in 'The Wrestler', reminds us once again of why he lost popularity in the first place: his performance is all smug and self-satisfied, as if it's enough to be a villain to speak in an awful Russian accent and walk around with a smirk. And what was with the bird? It was like he complained to the scriptwriter and they gave him that as a 'character quirk' even though it has no meaning and does nothing for the film.Very poorly written film executed in a highly predictable way",4,2,5,22 November 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Amusing, not classic
","This is a zombie film spoof, and there have been plenty of those before, but this one is a bit different. It's different in the sense that it's not quite as 'goofy' as others (like the notable 'Evil Dead' series and Peter Jackson's excellent 'Dead Alive'), this one is played with a pretty dry sense of humor. Shaun is a pretty regular guy who is supposed to lead this whole group of people to safety in the face of a zombie invasion. There are some funny gags; I especially liked when Shaun left his house and walked to his car, not even noticing the zombies ('sorry, no change'). The plot involving several girlfriends works well enough to propel the story, though it isn't really explained why all these other people join him in his strange quest to get to the local pub as if that represents safety and security (Shaun resembles Homer Simpson in this respect).I think this one will be remembered by a small group that loves it, but for most people this will pass in one ear and out the other.",6,2,5,22 November 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Decent fun but not as special as the first
","The first 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie was kind of a surprise -- I don't think expectations were really high for the film but it was a huge hit and in my opinion a lot of fun. The reverse is true now of the film's first sequel -- expectations were high and at least for me it was a letdown.The story finds our heroes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) once again in danger from an overzealous British naval captain (whose name I didn't catch and whose work was unexceptional). Will must try to fetch an important artifact from his friend Jack Sparrow (John Depp) to secure his future bride's freedom. She takes care of that with a little help from her dad (Jon Pryce) and joins him on the mad quest to do something vaguely connected to the compass and the 'still beating heart' of Davey Jones (Bill Nighy).So much for the film's plot, which feels like an obligatory afterthought to the effects and the character interactions. The plot just doesn't seem as compelling nor as tight as it was in the first film. Orlando Bloom shows no signs of growing ability or screen presence, in contrast to Knightley who gives probably the film's most surprising performance. The character work is also disappointing -- Bill Nighy is a good actor but here he's totally obscured by the effects and unable at any rate to even approximate the level of villainous charisma that enabled Geoff Rush to hold his own with Depp. Depp himself was disappointing to me as he seemed to be willing to act within the confines of what he had already done in the first film, and his character didn't have the kind of vague menace and wildness that it had in the first one. The film also follows the disappointing trend of many sequels of using lines that were well used in the original film in inappropriate situations in the sequels (the 'I'll be back' syndrome, if you will) -- here we have supporting characters played by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook cornering Ms. Swann and regaling her with a re-run of 'hello poppet!'. It's just lame and unimaginative, like Lucas with his pointless repetition of the 'I have a bad feeling about this' line.The sea creature villains are just not as interesting as the undead pirates in the first film. Also the makeup is relatively poor... I thought particularly the makeup on 'Bootstrap Bill Turner' was unconvincing. It looked like the makeup from an 80s episode of Star Trek.The movie is extremely long and has no conclusion -- not even the kind of temporary closure provided in other films like 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Lord of the Rings'.All in all I can say I wasn't bored -- the film's visual effects alone make for some interesting moments. But I just didn't feel caught up in it like I did in the first film, it felt manufactured. Things that were once exciting now feel like a routine. I'll probably return for the final film in the series hoping it will be more satisfying... but I couldn't recommend this film to anyone but fans of the series.",5,0,0,20 March 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Witty swashbuckler with fantasy elements is a winner
","I didn't expect too much from this film, but I do have a soft spot for pirates and I got to see this one at a drive-in, so I figured I had nothing to lose.  It turned out to be a really pretty good film, both for its stirring action and its witty dialogue, played to a tee by Depp and Bloom and bunch.  Depp is great and very appropriately over the top as a pirate captain out for revenge on the crew who abandoned him on an island for dead. The curse that has been placed on the crew requires them to find every peice of a particular treasure or they will have to live forever as zombies. This isn't a movie you could say a lot about, but it was a whole lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again, hopefully this time with a bottle of rum!",8,0,3,8 September 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A very enjoyable fantasy film
","I highly approve of this fantasy film for young people, and would also recommend it to older fantasy fans with fond memories of C.S. Lewis' memorable series. However, I would urge parents to keep kids under the age of 8 away as the film has some complex themes and a lot of violence.As a long-time fan of the Narnia books, I was as usual expecting to be under-whelmed by this film from the director of 'Shrek', a film I really did not enjoy. But the film is beautifully photographed and is more original and enjoyable than the Harry Potter films, though it is not quite as good as 'Lord of the Rings'. The child actors, first of all, were astounding. And if you have seen a lot of movies with child actors you know what I mean. Usually they are just ciphers, they just represent something for the adult characters to defend and love. But this film is really about the children, and the director has managed to get performances out of the children that are truly nuanced and alive.The sense of the fantasy world itself is very fulfilling. This is a film that satisfies the requirements for a faerie tale, and I enjoyed the way the movie used the idea of having Lucy go in first, then Edmund, and finally all 4 children. It really made the contrast between the faerie and the human worlds vivid. The audience is with Lucy 100% and so through her we experience the resistance that 'reality' presents when faced with the fey, which is one of the central themes in quality fantasy literature/film (see also 'Adventures of Baron Munchausen' for example, or the novel 'Don Quixote'). Then when Edmund denies having been there when the audience knows he 'really' was, it introduces the aspects of his character that are less than admirable in a believable way, which makes it easier for us to understand why he does side with the White Witch at first.Speaking of the White Witch, I have to say Tilda Swinton makes this movie worthwhile even if there were nothing else in the film. She is one of the best female villains I have ever seen in a film. If people want to make comparisons to the classic Margaret Hamilton performance in 'The Wizard of Oz', it wouldn't be too far out of line. Truly inspired work, she becomes more and more ferocious as she goes on. Unfortunately I don't really think they captured the sense that she was seductive in her early scenes with Edmund, and other than his jealous personality it's somewhat hard to imagine Edmund siding with her instead of being creeped out by her. I don't think that was so much Swinton's fault as how she was directed. This is a very good film but it lacks subtlety on certain levels.But a fantasy movie doesn't have to be subtle to be great. This film in its best moments truly soars. Aslan's death is handled very well, the scene is appropriately disgusting and the girls' lamentation convincing. Aside from the issue of timing (how did Asland manage to be resurrected, travel across Narnia to the White Witch's castle, breathe on all the frozen soldiers, and then get that army to the fields, all while the battle was taking place?) it is quite effective. The big battle at the end feels a bit too 'LOTR', but the minotaurs make a scary opponent and Swinton really pours gas on the fire in that scene. The early scenes with Lucy in the forest with the fawn are perfect. You get that sense of menace from the fawn without any of the ugly implications that might have come with it.Only minor complaints -- I thought the badger couple had a bit too much of the 'shrek' cheeziness in them, and it was inappropriate for mr. badger to call the kid a 'blighter'. I also thought the 'Father Christmas' segment was a bit on the cheezy side. But it does serve its function in the story.Another aspect of the film which should be commented on is the perfect balance it achieves between allegory and pure fantasy. The film-makers could have chosen to emphasize the religious allegory more, or they could have done some changes in the story to make it even less apparent, but I think they chose wisely to more or less adapt the story exactly how Lewis had done it, which is to leave the allegory in the open but not to push it in anyone's face. That is a harder balance to reach than it might seem and the film-makers should be praised for succeeding.",8,1,1,2 August 2006
Black Book," Verhoeven's masterpiece
","Director Paul Verhoeven, infamous in America for his ultra-violent satires like 'Total Recall' and 'Robocop' and his paranoid thrillers like 'Basic Instinct', returned to his native Holland to make this complex and beautiful film about hypocrisy and human character in the context of a story about the Dutch resistance in the last days of WWII. He found an incredible leading lady in Carice van Houten, and matched her up with the dynamic Thom Hoffman and the stolid and emotive Sebastian Koch to come up with a dizzying mixture of romance, terror and paranoia.Rachel Stein (van Houten) is a young Jewish woman forced to give up her livelihood as a singer in Germany and go into hiding. When she witnesses the brutal death of her entire family at an SS death squad's hands, she goes undercover as the lover of the SS commander Muntze (Koch) to get her own revenge. But she finds that it's not easy to know between good and evil, friend and foe, when money and power are involved.There's something of a mystery element to the plot, which keeps us guessing at all times regarding different characters' motives and actions. Towards the end of the film this produces an astonishing moral disorientation, as we're pulled inescapably into sympathizing with several Nazi characters and into recognizing the really horrible actions that victims can perpetrate on their one-time persecutors. There's a place where the film takes us where one would want to simply throw down one's hands and give up on the species -- but just as soon as he's let that sink in, Verhoeven reveals the film's true heroes to us and allows for the possibility of morally repugnant but emotionally satisfying revenge to come to fruition.I just cannot say enough about how excellent von Houten and Koch are in this film -- their natural chemistry, the zesty way they play their love scenes, the furtive glances and the emotional revelations. Of course their romance is deeply controversial and dangerous, but we do really feel like they made a real human connection. The point of the movie isn't to say 'well, there were some Nazis who were good.' It's to say that good and evil themselves mean nothing to people going through such situations and circumstances, so far beyond what human beings in a civilization should have to go through. At a certain point, the real human connection is all that we have.This is the best film I've seen by Verhoeven. His bold use of grotesque violence in this film is among its more daring artistic leaps. It's the same kind of violence that he used in his ridiculous action movies, and while we're used to more taste and sentimentality being put into death in a historical film, it accurately and directly conveys the naked reality of the situation, at a time when even the ostensible 'good guys' couldn't really afford to be noble about anything. Although the film is full of graphic sex and violence, I would argue that it is less an 'exploitation' film than most of the more 'tasteful' epics we've seen from Hollywood on the subject of the holocaust and the war. There is no false or unearned sentiment in this movie; the movie and the characters don't have time for it.It's a gorgeous, profound, provocative film that takes the dialog about the holocaust and WWII to another level in terms of screen stories.",10,1,5,21 September 2009
Pirate Radio," Disappointing use of talent
","Richard Curtis could have made a great, freewheeling, anarchic film about the last days of pirate off-shore radio in 1960s England.... but this isn't it. Instead he has delivered a rather predictable feel-good movie full of unlikely events and barely likable characters, making uncomfortable fun within the boundaries of the sexist 'good times' that were, apparently, the 1960s.... (for some).Typical of the movie's low ambition is the way that the government is treated in the film. Now, I'm not an expert on British politics or history.... I'm an American kid who grew up in the 1980s, and most of what I know about English politics in the late 60s, I learned from watching re-runs of Monty Python's Flying Circus. But even I am aware that Britain's government in the late 60s was mostly made up of labour liberals, whose main problem with pirate radio was the fact that they could not control it. Instead of something reflecting political reality, this film presents a very dull one-dimensional performance by Kenneth Branagh as a right-wing reactionary type.Also typical of the movie's narrow imagination, is the way in which each of the significant female characters in the film is named after a popular 60s song (i.e. Leonard Cohen's 'Marianne'), just so that the film-makers can deposit a brief montage using the pop goodies as emotional telegraph. I thought this was really predictable, and very 'Hollywood' in a way.The film's conclusion is sickeningly 'feel good', with a ridiculous long shot of hundreds of little digital dingies floating in the water to save a bunch of characters who really didn't deserve so much emotion. I felt silly just for watching it. Curtis and everybody else involved should take a good look at their motivations before making any more films.",4,1,3,12 April 2013
Batman Returns," The best Batman film
","Although not necessarily the most successful of the Batman films, this has always been my personal favorite. Despite its chilly Christmas setting, the film was released in the middle of a very hot summer. I was spending some time in Arizona, and going into an air-conditioned theater to watch this frosty film was like a blast of relief. The movie itself combines dark humor and wild visuals, Burton's very best big budget film.Batman (Michael Keaton) does indeed return, with a pair of villains to face this time -- abandoned child Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the less nefarious and more ambiguous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). DeVito's Penguin is at the same time less anarchic than Nicholson's Joker from the first film, and more of a threat to Batman because his schemes are more calculated and his political sensibilities more refined. As for the Catwoman, she and Batman strike up a kind of sadistic affair that's paralleled by the hesitant courtship between their alter egos, Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle.DeVito is an excellent actor and a good choice for the Penguin, but his performance just can't match the kind of charm that Nicholson had in the first film. It's really Pfeiffer's sexy latex-draped Catwoman that makes the film. There's moments of great wit, like when she looks down at her ruined 'claw' with an expression that suddenly takes her back to her secretary days (err... 'executive assistant'). There's also a nice performance by Christopher Walken (with the rather not-so-subtle homage name of Max Shreck) as a greedy crimelord. He gets more time to develop this outside villain than Jack Palance had in the first one, and brings a lot of moments of great humor to the relationship with the Penguin. You almost start to like him by the end, but his score with the Catwoman must be settled.The theme of the film is, once again, duality -- but it works somewhat better than the first film, because the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is more natural and compelling. I also like the one scene with the Penguin and Batman where Penguin accuses Batman of being jealous, 'you're not a real freak.' Really great ideas that are well developed in the interplay between these 3 bizarre personas and their alter-egos.As for Burton's direction, it's much more relaxed and distinctive in this film compared to the first one. A new Gotham set was built for Burton on the west coast (the first one was done in England), and the settings and style are more picturesque, dark, and expansive. You can tell that he had just done 'Edward Scissorhands' and was really feeling his oats when he did this one, at the top of his game trying to top his previous effort. A lot of people, maybe Jack Nicholson fans, might disagree, but I thought that he got the tone and everything just right for this film. It's not too serious but it's also not too goofy; rather than alternating moments of seriousness and camp we get in the first film, this one has a more consistent tone as well.",8,2,4,21 September 2009
The Great Dictator," Not so great dictator Chaplin makes a mess of this one
","This film starts off on a high note, with Chaplin returning to the 'little tramp' form in sequences showing his bumbling attempts to help his fellow Germans win WWI, but the second half of the film degenerates amidst the not-so-soluble dual plotlines (involving, of course, star Chaplin in both plots) and pitiful verbal humor and ends on a note of unconvincing propaganda.  He plays both the Jewish barber and the leader of the Germans. There are some very witty moments in this latter role, such as his dance with with an inflated globe, but too much verbal ethnic humor (of the low vaudeville type) is not alleviated by a sufficient amount of slapstick violence.  Also, the plot's fluctuations between the two characters' stories becomes disconcerting and makes the film unfocused.  Goddard makes an unconvincing impoverished Jewess; she is a talented actress but she's wasted here as the object of mostly idealized romanticism.  Chaplin's sincerity goes way past the breaking point of credulity in his final, ludicrously optimistic speech (yes, this one would put even Spencer Tracy to shame!).  This scene, which is played straight and has no humor whatsoever, ends the film on a sour, unconvincing note and does much to unhinge any satire that preceded it.An interesting failure at best.",4,16,38,24 October 2002
The Mummy," The Mummy is a decent modern pulp film
","I was averse to seeing this movie for whatever reason, but I ended up seeing the second half of it a few years ago, and just managed to track down the DVD and watch it. I actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Fraser was excellent in the role, the supporting cast held up their end of the bargain. Mostly what I would note about this film is that it does an admirable job of using conventions of the 'pulp' genre while putting enough modern touches into it to make a modern audience feel at home. Some of those -- particularly I remember my distaste at Fraser using a machine gun against the mummies -- are rather off-putting, but in general the film is reminiscent of 'Indiana Jones' as far as evoking the old H.R. Haggard style adventure story. I would recommend it, with slight reservations, to other fans of films of this genre.",6,0,1,15 February 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Nice movie, very poignant
","The people who made this movie should be praised for not giving in to the apologetic and self-righteous tone of so many 'social progress' movies we've seen since the birth of cinema. Unfortunately some of the stylistic choices like the steel-guitar heavy soundtrack make it a bit too sincere for its own good, and there is a kind of pleading quality to some of Lee's scenes.But for what it's worth, Ledger and Gyllenhaal are tremendous in the film and hold the entire package together. I found myself quite torn up by the story, after having laughed off some of the early scenes as a bit too much or too precious. There's a tasteful rhythm to the thing once it gets going, and Lee allows Ledger a long leash which Ledger does not abuse with his astonishing performance as the self-tortured silent type who holds the relationship back from becoming official. Gyllenhaal does a good job of portraying someone who is more open about his emotions, but still afraid to tell Ledger about his affair with another rancher (he tells his lover that he's having an affair with the man's wife instead). This is where we realize Ledger's character has only been able to live with the romance up to this point by considering it a 'special' relationship between the 2 of them; the idea that Gyllenhaal's character might be with some other man is disastrous to him, and he even threatens to kill him.The female characters are only spectators, and their role is fittingly smaller. Anne Hathaway did not impress me, didn't seem like any kind of Texas rural type at all. Michelle Williams did better with what she was given, and grabs a bit more of the audience's sympathy.I don't have that much more to offer, except that I'm glad for the most part the movie avoided a 'shock effect' that seemed obvious in the subject matter, and instead treated its subject with integrity. This isn't the story of gay love, it's a story of gay love. It's not really about sex, but it doesn't shy away from sex. It's a powerful portrait of how love is crushed not so much by 'society' as by our obedience to society, our repressed fear and anger. In that respect it has more in common with, say, James Ivory's 'Remains of the Day' than it does with activist 'gay cinema' which is usually much more concerned with bringing about a resolution of the conflict between society and individual that always feels contrived in this still-sore area of social conflict. The film-makers did a great service to the characters by not sacrificing them at the altar of message-film.",8,4,4,1 March 2010
Ed Wood," Exceptional bio-pic only slightly marred by blurred truth
","This film traces the rise (but not the fall) of notorious B film-maker Edward D. Wood, Jr. Ed Wood made some of the most famous B movies of the 1950s, including the final films of legendary 'Dracula' actor Bela Lugosi. The film depicts how Wood was able to overcome many obstacles to get his films finished, including primarily his lack of financing (the film accurately shows his unusual funders, including religious groups who insist on Wood and cast/crew being baptized prior to filming), his odd group of semi-professional actors (many of whom, including Lugosi, had issues with substance abuse), and his fixation on angora sweaters and penchant for cross-dressing. A picture strongly emerges that Wood was a dreamer, a man who had all the passion and energy necessary for film-making but lacked the talent to make it work.The performances are excellent all around. Depp makes his strongest impression as Wood, bringing manic energy and enthusiasm plus a charming lack of self-consciousness. Martin Landau was recognized by the Academy for his portrayal of the aging, morphine addicted horror legend Lugosi. He is alternately pathetic and majestic as the moment demands, leaving us with the sad impression of a giant who was not appreciated in his own time but whose own ego might have grown unrealistically in compensation for the fact. As Wood's first girlfriend Dolores Fuller (who later had a career writing movie tunes for Elvis Presley), Sarah Jessica Parker also leaves an impression as a woman determined to make it in the world and Hollywood but unable to cope with Wood's transvestitism or his weird group of friends.One of the things that makes the film truly extraordinary is Burton's ability to capitalize on the opportunities the script provides for moments of both great sadness and great humor -- sometimes even in the same scenes. For example, Lugosi's scene in 'Bride of the Monster' ('Home, I have no home!') is used twice. First it is used rather humorously as we see Wood's enthusiasm for the scene (which has elicited laughter from many audiences over the years because of Lugosi's strained enthusiasm and the over-the-top sentiment expressed in the speech ('I will create a new race of atomic supermen!') during the actual filming. Then we see him doing the scene on the street on a whim, Burton keeps the camera intently on Wood and Lugosi, but as he finishes the scene we pull back and see a crowd has gathered, and they are applauding. Unfortunately there is a lot of wishful thinking in this film if you were to look at it as a true biography of Ed Wood. There's a tendency to go by the adage 'print the legend'. Lots and lots of stories have been circulated about Wood over the years, many outright false, and this film unfortunately repeats some of them. This doesn't damage its standing as a piece of entertainment but does damage its integrity as biography and also as art in some ways. The film labors to give a picture of Wood as a guy who had all the enthusiasm and passion but none of the talent to be a success -- unfortunately this is incorrect to some extent on both counts. For example in his memoirs Alex Gordon (who produced 'Bride' with Wood) says that he moved in with Wood to work on projects in the early 50s because he wanted to be closer to Wood: he said he admired Wood's skill as a writer but that Wood had no self-discipline. He and others have commented on the fact that it was Wood's alcoholism more than any other factor which impeded his success in Hollywood -- Wood would often spend production money on alcohol for himself and the cast/crew and would run out of funds prior to completion due to all the parties. None of this is shown in the film; all we get is a card at the film's conclusion which implies that alcohol was only a problem for Wood after the events depicted in the film. However it is truly important in Wood's career and life -- producers knew about his substance abuse problems and it was part of the reason he was never formally employed as a director by AIP or Columbia or any other 'studio'. The film would make you believe that it was either dumb luck or Wood's lack of talent that kept him out of work. But in my opinion there were many less talented writers than Wood working for poverty row companies, and in fact Wood was hired by professionals like Ron Ashcroft and the famous stuntman Yakima Canutt to do script doctoring on B movies in his early years.The issue of Wood's relationship with Lugosi is a far more serious departure from truth in favor of mythology, however. People may not realize it now, but there was definitely a time when many if not the majority of classic horror fans considered Wood partially to blame for Lugosi's demise, or at least for the declining quality of his films prior to his death. Many of the rumors which supported this former belief are untrue, but Burton and his writers have here substituted an equally untrue opposite myth -- a kind of image of Wood as an angel helping to rescue Lugosi from his addiction. In reality Wood and Lugosi were more like co-dependents, and it's highly doubtful that Wood did anything substantial to help Lugosi with his addiction. On the other hand Wood did do a lot of things to help Lugosi professionally, so to some extent those parts of the film (depicting Wood's role in Lugosi's TV career, for example) serve to correct a longstanding impression that Wood was just a leach on Lugosi in the dying giant's last years.",9,1,1,20 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Another poor sequel
","Speaking as someone who greatly enjoyed the first 'Pirates' film (heretofore referred to as 'POC') -- which I saw in the same drive-in where I saw this 3rd installment -- I have to say I find the whole situation pretty sad. It's a reasonably entertaining film in a way, although you'd best be advised to put your brain in neutral to avoid the possibility of headaches and nausea. But where P1 featured fiery dialogue that brought life to the trite events of the film's plot, this film tries to build up a complex story and leaves the characters hanging on a limb.A big part of the problem, I think, is that while in the original film all 3 of the major characters' motivations dovetail into one enveloping plot, for the 2nd and 3rd films the writers have taken them off in separate directions and never seem to really be able to bring them back together again in a convincing way. Whatever resolutions this (hopefully) final film has to offer feels likewise disconnected and forced. There are characters such as Calliope and Davy Jones who have been made major plot motivators but about whom I personally felt forced into caring about. People seem to disappear and reappear in other places for no reason other than the demands of the film's twisted plot. The skeleton pirates from POC were absolutely classic, but the fish-person HP Lovecraft-reject hammerhead sharks and so forth never had any charm or personality, and this 3rd film doesn't even have the imagination to supplant them with a new or more interesting menace. They don't even look good on screen IMHO -- they look like they just walked off the set of a 1980s episode of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. In particular I never cared for Will Turner's dad as a character -- he was better left in the audience's imagination. We do see a kind of 'Council of Pirates', but for me it just brought back painful memories of the silly made-up villains of 'Dick Tracy'.All in all I would argue that the writers totally lost sight of the things that made the original film so much fun. They made the classic mistake -- just like Lucas in the mostly awful 'Star Wars' sequels -- of turning something that's essentially a pulp-styled adventure film and trying to turn it into a 'LOTR' style epic. They completely the missed the appeal of Geoff Rush's Captain Barbosa -- in this film he is neutered of all menace and therefore his words and actions carry no weight, like a shadow of the original character. I would rather he just not be in the film; it's pathetic that the freaking monkey got more screen time in these sequels than Rush.And of course you have to mention Depp's Jack Sparrow. It's easier to analyze plot weaknesses and so forth than to talk about a performance, but the performance really has lost a lot of the spontaneity and energy that it had originally. Again I think some of this is basically unavoidable -- after all, Depp has already created the character so he's not nearly as challenged or engaged in this film as he was in POC. But part of the problem is, again, that lack of menace. We now see Jack Sparrow as essentially a good guy and no intelligent viewer is going to be confused by the film's meager attempts to keep us guessing at his motives. with all the major characters firmly established as 'Pirates' (and even a 'Pirate King'), the mystery and sense of danger from POC has gradually been watered down to nothing.Then there's also the fate of one of my favorite supporting characters, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport). In POC, he was given some surprisingly complex character development -- he begins as a stuck-up rival to Will Turner and ends up becoming a friend to the heroes. The 2nd film reversed his character development as if the end of the film hadn't even happened, and this film basically recycled his character transformation from POC, with the same idea but of course now with no surprise or charm. In fact the scene where he rescues Elizabeth feels very rushed, as if the director didn't want to do the scene at all.What more could I say? I'm just very disappointed that a film that really exemplified to me the highest possibilities of the so-called 'popcorn movie' has been turned into a series just as pointless and dull as 'Resident Evil'. I hope they make no more of these films and I hope that I never have to see it again.",3,0,3,27 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Decent conclusion to a good series
","Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 3' isn't as good as you hoped and it's not as bad as you might have heard. It is a solid conclusion to the story initiated in the first installment, and (unlike most other recent sequels) if you enjoyed the other 2 films in the series I think it's safe to say you won't be bored with this one.There simply aren't any villains in the Spiderman comics as exciting as the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, so perhaps in compensation this film gives us 3 different villains. It also asks us to ponder what becomes of an innocent love like that of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) when one of the lovers is highly successful in life while the other meets bitter disappointments (in the case of M.J., a weak Broadway debut singing an old Irving Berlin song). Parker has become so comfortable with his girlfriend that his treatment actually becomes unintentionally callous, as when he kisses a blonde he knows from school (Bryce Dallas Howard) in an imitation of the 'trademark' kiss with M.J. from the first film. I don't think, for example, that it's a coincidence calls her the familiar (and gender-neutral) 'M.J.' while more attentive Harry (James Franco) calls her 'Mary Jane'. Unfortunately Harry's still harboring affection for his old man, and only an improbably bout of amnesia keeps him from donning his armor as the 'New Green Goblin' through most of the film. Spidey is also confronted with the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), the film's most sympathetic villain, a would-be thief who wanders into a disintegration chamber and becomes a shape shifter, and he struggles with his dark side after an alien organism bonds with his body to produce a new black suit that draws out his arrogant side. The 3rd side villain is Venom, who starts out as Spiderman's rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace).So let's just take the villains in order. I think James Franco's performances have been improving and I'd quite like to see him in something where he can stretch his muscles a bit more. He's got that wicked grin that reminds you of ambiguous bad guys of the past from Jack Nicholson on down through Lon Chaney. I liked him in the movie, but his character didn't get that much attention and the whole amnesia angle was pretty contrived even if it did manage to advance the story along. The film's weakest scene is a cheat, depriving us of judging the extent of Franco's talent  he's saved from making an important and painful decision about whether to kill Spidey by a lame dues-ex-machina confession from the butler of all people! Church gave the best performance and had the most interesting character, even if his stand-issue-melodrama sick child was just as contrived as Greeney's amnesia. He really managed to connect with the audience to a remarkable extent especially considering how few bones the writers threw his way. Also the effects sequences with Sandman's initial rampage were the most impressive and engaging in the film. A lot of the other effects scenes become too 'noisy' or crowded with movement and it detracts from the emotion and suspense of the scenes, particularly the nonsense scene where hundreds of cars are for some reason on top of a half-finished skyscraper waiting to be hurled at Spidey by Venom and Sandman, who've joined forces.Venom was the weakest villain, but only part of the blame belongs to Grace. He was actually very effective in the scenes where he played Eddie Brock  he looks and acts like a slightly better and more glamorous version of Peter Parker, which is just perfect. But the character ends up being poorly written when he makes the transition to supervillain. First of all, it's understandable that he'd be angry when Parker exposed his scam with the photos but I didn't buy that it would send him on a mission of vengeance. And for another thing if he was going to put on the suit and become Venom they should have given him that choice and let him make a decision instead of having it appear to be an accident. The effects for Venom were also a huge miscalculation IMHO  once he was Venom, Grace's voice should have sufficed to establish his identity. Continually peeling away the Venom mask to reveal Grace's face every single time he delivered dialog was a bad idea  it just didn't look right somehow and also felt repetitive. It was a lazy solution to the problem of keeping Grace's interpretation of the character front and center after he put on the suit.That's about all I have to say about the film. I thought it was fairly interesting because it got into themes of the dark side of heroism and success, something I haven't really seen in serious action films too often. Some of the action scenes were very good, others were just kind of over the top. I liked the development of the triangle between MJ, Peter and Harry. It's definitely not as good as I was hoping it would be when the first film came out, but it's a reasonably satisfying conclusion to the 'story arc'  and maybe I'm the only one but I felt it was better in general than the second film in the series.",6,1,2,15 June 2007
The Prestige," Movie Magic
","I went into this with somewhat low expectations since I really didn't care much for Nolan and Bale's collaboration on 'Batman Begins' and I haven't seen anything else by Nolan. I guess I heard some good things about it, plus it was about magicians and my girlfriend will watch anything with David Bowie. Well, I was pretty much floored because it's one of the most enjoyable and intriguing films I've seen in the last few years. With the exception of Johansson who doesn't seem to know what to do with her role, every performance was memorable. Bale finally convinced me that he's a leading man, Jackman was for once as good as his talent would make you think he should be, and it was especially refreshing to see Bowie and Michael Caine in a movie that's actually good for a change. The direction is very stylish but at the same time always appropriate. The twin diary narrative really serves the film well. I always love that moment when the story catches up to the narrator and you never really know if the narrator has all the clues up to that point. When the movie reaches the point where the narration began (in this case, the trip to Colorado to find Tesla), a whole new set of possibilities is opened up and it's almost like you can start the movie all over again.I have to give it some more time to set in but I'm excited about watching it again because there are so many lines and even whole scenes that take on a different meaning once the conclusion is known. Some of the things that felt pretty weak the first time around (i.e. 'I loved you yesterday') could become either poignant or at least ironic. Some things that felt strong already (i.e. 'nobody cares about the man in the box') become disturbingly resonant.I love movies that are able to entertain with a narrative and at the same time suggest themes about film itself or entertainment in general that mirror the story. This is really one of the better recent examples of this type of writing  the whole film fulfills the model of the magician and the 3 moments in a magic trick. The film presents us with some situations that seem mundane (the relationship with wife and mistress, Angiers' obsession with the Transported Man trick), then it 'turns' and makes these mundane relationships feel bizarre and twisted (and possibly unreal) only to deliver a superb 'prestige' in the end which makes us realize that there IS emotional truth in these characters despite the more bizarre aspects of their character development. Perhaps the only serious flaw in the film is that the process takes so long to unravel that the audience has already decided long before the end that they don't like either of these characters  you can only sit in the darkened theater afterwards to ponder whether perhaps one of these two brothers wasn't quite as bad as the other.'Are you watching closely?'  in terms of meaning, it could just as easily have been a command: 'Watch closely.' But I think that would describe a different, and less polemical, movie. I think it was written as a question because this movie really seeks to engage the audience, not just to blow us away with effects, acting, story revelations, but to make us think about what we're seeing, to be constantly questioning what the film seems to expect us to believe. The magic trick won't even work without the audience's willing participation in the larger scheme of mystery and revelation. So I'm slightly surprised that so many posters here as well as intelligent film critics like Roger Ebert seem to consider the steampunkish sci-fi elements associated with the Tesla character to be out of place or even a betrayal of the audience's faith. I felt from the very first moments of the film that there were really no rules about where the story could take us. And frankly, it's a cool idea and it adds a lot of wonder and amazement to the story's conclusion. Sure, the film may not qualify as 'high fantasy' or even perhaps as science fiction (since there's no likely explanation in sight as to why the device should work other than Tesla's reputation and the mystique he was given by the director and writers), but I think there's no real reason why a fantasy element can't be introduced late in the story and that the entire framework should adequately prepare the viewer to accept the possibility of Tesla's device working since the Tesla element is one of the first explored at least initially in the narrative despite taking place later in the sequence of events. Bowie and Serkis are fantastic as a pair of modern-day wizards, and the whole idea of using Edison's men as villains is priceless and will striek anyone who knows early cinema history as very true. People in general might not know about how brutal Edison's goons were when they enforced his patents and crushed his competitors; Edison's own self-aggrandizing behavior still skews our picture of him to this day. This movie is a great bit of overdue payback on behalf of Tesla from Hollywood, a town founded by people escaping Edison's goons but who later helped to create his myth through film.",9,3,5,13 December 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Improves on the original
","I didn't care much for the original 'Hellboy', which I watched just last week for the first time. Well the little lady dragged me out to see the sequel (isn't it supposed to be the other way around?) and I guess I'm glad because I thought it was considerably more entertaining. The villains are more compelling and interesting; in the first one they were some Nazi rejects and Rasputin, truly weird but not very interesting. In this one it's representatives of the ancient elvish or faerie race who've become discontent with human development and decided to renew an age-old war with humanity. Hellboy, ironically but predictably, is on the side of the humans instead of his fellow beasties.The one thing I said I did enjoy about the first movie was Ron Perlman's performance. It's even better this time around. Selma Blair is still kind of weak, but she's in less of the film and they wisely didn't ask Rupert Evans back. Jeffrey Tambor is just as out of place in this film as he was in the first one. Johann Kraus is sort of a bizarre character that I didn't think completely worked. But basically I thought this one was funnier (the beer drinking scene with Hellboy and Abe Sapien is classic, raising the whole movie to a higher level), and also I liked the villains a lot more. I like the romance between Abe (Doug Jones) and Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), because it was dealt with in a much lighter tone than the romance in the first film, or most superhero movies for that matter. Both 'Hellboy 2' and 'Iron Man' showed this summer that a subtle romance can work in a superhero movie, and the audience won't feel either imposed upon or ripped off. This one is played for laughs as well as genuine sentiment, a perfectly impossible affair.One small note -- it seems like with the whole scary elves thing, the director del Toro may be 'gearing up' for the Hobbit 2 parter he's going to be doing. I've got my fingers crossed, but hopefully it'll be a lot better than this.",6,0,3,17 August 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Best Black Comedy ever
","I recommend this movie to everyone.  When I first saw it I was a 15 year old Stan Kubrick fan from the Clockwork Orange school.  I wasn't accustomed to watching black and white films, nor older comedies without the r rated humor I was accustomed to (I'm 24 now, so I grew up in the fab eighties).  But this movie proved on successive viewings one of the most influential movies in my life, streering my adolescent viewpoint away from ignorant warmongering to pacivism.  I love how it shows up the whole military establishment as the product of fucked up sexuality, in other words a lack of real creativity.  See it if you haven't.See it again if you forgot.",10,1,1,26 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," weakest of the 'OT' -- but still a delight
","This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. It's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.One problem here is the look of the film, which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer Gary Kurtz. The first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. In 'Jedi' on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.Another aspect is its lack of originality. Where 'Star Wars' created a whole new experience in cinema and 'Empire' brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, 'Jedi' lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think Lucas or Kasdan could). Also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of 'Star Wars' if they hadn't run out of cash. It just feels like lazy construction.The most unfortunate aspect of 'Jedi' for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character. Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced Leia loves Luke -- as if the conclusion of 'Empire' where she confessed her love of him had never happened. The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. Ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This is more like a 1990s Ford performance, bored and looking 'above' the film itself. Fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. Lando, an interesting character introduced in 'Empire', here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. Only Hamill, given an interesting development in the Luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. Ian McDiarmid does excellent work as well as the Emperor. The film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).Visually and in terms of effects work, other than the 'clean' look of everything it's hard to find fault. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of Lucas' later productions.",7,8,20,16 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Extraordinary adult faerie tale
","This film is really excellent... perhaps not absolutely everything I hope for in a film, or in a fantasy/faerie film, it's totally unique and certainly never dull. Part of me thinks that the violence in the film was too excessive, though it was not exploitative because it ties into the general themes of the film. But that part of me thinks that a truly great faerie tale can be scary but should be something that children could have access to.The performances are uniformly top notch. Ivana Baquero gives us one of the more emotionally real child performances we've seen in a long time, especially in the fantasy field. Sergi Lopez is strong as her fascist (and sadistic) step-father, Capitan Vidal. Maribel Verdu probably has the most to do in the film and she manages to do her acting in such a way that you can believe that she could possibly be overlooked initially, while what she shows you beneath the character's surface shows unsuspected strength. Doug Jones also puts in an impressive performance as Pan, conveying the menace and majesty of the faun.A few words on the theme of the film -- I think in a lot of ways it is about obedience. It's more complex than what appears at first. The contrast is there certainly between the captain, who is totally obsessed with discipline and order, and the child Ofelia who is very free spirited. When the doctor walks away after killing the prisoner, the captain asks him why he did not obey his order. The doctor says that he can't simply obey for the sake of obeying -- 'only people like you can do that.' If you think about the 3 challenges that Ofelia has to pass, in the first one she obeys the instructions of the faun and despite all of the horror of her situation, she easily escapes. In the second trial she is unable to obey the rules, incurring Pan's wrath because she ate of the food and she did not escape through the door. But in the final trial she is presented with a situation where to obey the rules or to obey Pan would be wrong, and she makes her own decision in favor of sparing an innocent life even at great costs to her own. This can be seen as a metaphor or analogy to encourage people not to obey dictators when they issue immoral rules, much as her stepfather the Captain would do. Her ascendance to the magical realm can be seen as a hopeful metaphor for what the human race itself can aspire to, if we begin to value the lives of innocents more than any other prize.I think the film doesn't really fail to do anything it attempts to do, but I wish that the film-makers had been able to fashion a convincing faerie tale like this in a way that would have, as I said above, been more accessible to younger viewers. For example I think Gilliam's 'Time Bandits' or Burton's 'Big Fish' presented some very adult ideas but did so in a way so that not only would the films themselves be suitable for somewhat younger audiences but those dark/adult themes would also be opened up for the young audience. Faerie tales can be used for many purposes, but rarely in the classic literature do we see them used simply for entertainment. Usually they are also cautionary tales with some symbolic resonance. Faerie tales were also a form of mythology, in the sense that they were used to explain the unexplainable. For example the English term 'stroke' as in 'she suffered a stroke' comes from the older term for 'faerie struck' or struck down by fey influences beyond human understanding. What I think the film-makers in this case are doing, is presenting a kind of 'instructional' faerie tale whose purpose is to 'explain' the reasons for evil in this world, for the continued existence of fascism and the continued oppression of innocent people. I only wish that it could have been done in such a way that it would actually reach children and communicate these ideas to children because sadly by the time we reach adulthood it's already too late for many of us to escape the cycle of violence that the film presents.",8,3,6,21 February 2007
Knocked Up," some funny parts, horrible ending
","I've heard quite a bit of buzz about this film, and I have some affection for writer/director Apatow's previous works, so I was reasonably (though cautiously) optimistic about this heavy-handed pregnancy farce. Sadly, it's only about 2/3 of a good movie. After setting the audience up with some pretty raucous humor and a pleasingly cynical sensibility, the film eventually betrays the audience and degenerates into sugar-coated romantic comedy tripe of the foulest kind. I kept expecting or hoping for some kind of surprise, something or anything to pay off on the promise of some of the early parts of the film that were amusing.I've seen the press reports hailing Seth Rogen as a 'breakout' comedy star because of this film. But I felt no real star quality around him at all. He's still just an amusing side character, not someone who you can really accept as the focus of an entire film. His character should be likable in an obnoxious kind of way but eventually he just becomes annoying. He can make us laugh, sure -- as when he tosses toys at the kids to get them to 'fetch' -- but it's really Katherine Heigl's reactions that make it funny for the most part. Not the stuff that stars are made of, but it wouldn't surprise me to see Heigl become sort of a new Cameron Diaz. She's got the necessary looks and she has the star presence, which in the case of this film -- coupled with Leslie Mann's solid turn as her paranoid married sister -- makes Rogen and Paul Rudd's weary 'man show' type performances feel pretty tired.Not really worth seeking out, maybe worth a laugh or two on late night cable at some point.",4,5,10,27 June 2007
Megamind," A few funny moments don't really make up for its lack of inspiration
","The story and the comedy here are just a bit too much like 'The Incredibles' -- this time it's Will Ferrell as a supervillain who's forced by the death of his rival (Brad Pitt) to first create, and ultimately, become, a superhero. I didn't see it in 3D, but on a flat screen the visual effects were interesting to look at, but not very inspiring or transporting. There's very little novelty in its fantasy world, just a sort of standard superhero, art-deco, Superman spoof type of thing.'Space Dad' who looks and talks like Brando in the 1970s Salkind Brothers' version of 'Superman' is a joke that's probably going to go over most viewer's heads, and really isn't all that funny for the geeks and old folks who remember. This is typical of the sort of third-generation feeling of the movie. We felt we've already seen these types of ironic superhero revisionist things before, and the film never stretches itself to provide anything but a farce of the very tired and worn conventions of superhero films.There are a few funny scenes, and it should divert children.",4,2,7,21 February 2014
Alien," Solid suspense film set in space
","This is one of the few sci-fi horror films from the period of the late 70s/early 80s that has really held up with time.On a visual level, the film is highly satisfying. Green and light blue colors are saturated throughout the film, but so grayed that the movie almost appears at many points to be shot in black and white. The miniatures and matte effects used in the original film were quite good.The movie works on pretty much every level, though you can't really say it's an incredible story either. On a sci-fi level, the best parts are the early parts where we first see the alien technology. I was disappointed actually in the print that I saw because I believe it was altered with computers, I remember seeing more matte screens that resembled the HR Geiger artwork when the film was on video. Anyway, the alien technology succeeds on a level never before achieved in terms of showing a realistic alien culture. We can almost imagine these creatures living on this ship, it seems to fit in with the alien biology so well.When they arrive back on their own ship, the film unfortunately descends into a fairly typical horror action film. Perhaps taking a note from Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Scott kills off the only reasonably well known actor in the film (at the time of its release), Tom Skerrit, fairly quickly and leaves us with the then-unknown Weaver as the hero. This makes her the first really butt-kicking female heroine of a sci-fi action film, and that alone qualifies this film as groundbreaking.The cast in general is just amazing. Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton -- these are quite simply some of the best character actors of their generation, all gathered for the purpose of making this more than just a typical monster movie. Other films such as 'Predator' tried but failed to get a supporting cast as distinguished and talented as this one gathered for a sci-fi action film. The quality of these actors makes the film better not only in the individual scenes they are in (such as Holm's incredible turn once exposed), but also the aggregate total of the film -- because the actors are so good and the characters relatively fleshed out, we can imagine right up until the film's final moments that any one of them could be the one who ends up surviving.Another interesting element not often commented on is the cynical attitude the astronauts have towards 'the company', which employs them. From Kotto and Stanton's character's complaints about the hours, all the way up to Weaver's discovery that all of them were expendable and kept in the dark as to the true purpose of their mission (which Skerrit's character seems to also know more about than Weaver's), there is a kind of dark realism here that you won't find in the vast majority of films of this type. It dovetails with the other element I've talked about, the fact that the cast is so good that any one of them could be the 'hero' -- this is a very democratic look at the future, one edged with deep cynicism but with an ultimate eye towards presenting a future of real people who are oppressed by situations far beyond their control. It is a far cry from the Utopian dreams of Heinlein and other sci-fi progenitors and represents this film's true gift to science fiction as a whole.",7,18,29,22 August 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," not what it could have been
","I'd like to imagine how good this movie could have been, say if it had been done in the 1980s. But at this point in his career Tim Burton is more slick than he is audacious, and Sondheim's musical has been around for so long that it's not really anything fresh. Certainly the performances in this film pale in comparison to the filmed play that I saw with Angela Lansbury in the role that Helena Bonham Carter plays in this film. Where Carter is all twitchy mannerisms and never appears for a second as a real human being, Lansbury played the role like a lark and ended up making it more disturbing as a result.Carter and Johnny Depp look less like 19th Century malcontents than they do like they just dressed up to go to a Morrisey or Cure concert. Jamie Campbell Bower looks like he would last approximately 30 seconds on a ship. Totally miscast, although he seems an interesting actor perhaps in some other role. The only really bright spots on the cast were Alan Rickman (unsurprisingly) and Sacha Baron Cohen (quite surprisingly). Rickman is always great at these kind of oily characters, and he gives the judge an air of vanity that's quite disgusting. Cohen did a good job as the egotistical rival barber Pirelli.The music itself wasn't always well served in this film. I don't know if it was just the DVD or how the film was made, but I kept having to turn the music down because it would get too loud and then turn the TV back up to hear the often whispered dialog. Some of the most memorable songs were cut out for this film too, for no real reason that I can see. I'm not a huge Sondheim fan -- the only song in this show that I really like is 'By the Sea' or whatever it's called, and if I had to suffer through 'Johanna' one more time in my entire life it'll make me want to slit my own throat.Depp and Carter are called upon to hold the film together and for me they failed. Carter has no charm and Depp seems to just brood for the whole film. They look silly sitting there in the park with so much white makeup on their faces. Generally this film could have benefited from more of a contrast instead of putting everything in such muted tones. That's how a lot of movies are these days though, they get carried away with digital color filters.This is basically a vanity project that was probably more fun to make than it was to watch.",5,0,1,6 April 2009
The Doors," Nice music, but I don't see the point
","Maybe I'm not the 'target audience' for this one, but I really wonder who other than huge fans of The Doors (or specifically Jim Morrison, since pretty much 99% of the movie is about him) would really find much to enjoy in this movie. Jim Morrison didn't do anything important, and if he had anything important to say it sure wasn't communicated by this movie. The movie actually makes Morrison look worse than I think he really was, in the sense that I think at his better times he was probably a better performer than what they showed here. Certainly his poetry is not the aspect of his art that I would personally choose to emphasize, and this is where it becomes pretty obvious that the people who made the movie are fans. They've set these horrible poems that he wrote to new 1980s sounding music, just really grating on the ears. Jim Morrison's poetry is OK as lyrics, nothing incredible in my opinion, but when you use them in a spoken word kind of way it betrays the weakness. Then you have to have Meg Ryan who's playing his girlfriend ooh and aaah over the lame poems, and the whole movie just starts off on a really wrong note.The way they showed the 'scene' of that time was very cool, and the movie is very well photographed. When they're not doing Morrison's weak poetry, the songs hold the film together well enough I suppose. I liked that the film wasn't afraid to at least hint at the extremely poor quality of the band's releases from their middle period, especially 'The Soft Parade.' I recognized a lot of the locations in the film. I think the scene that was supposed to be set in Miami was filmed at what's now called the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (used to be called just the Civic Auditorium but was renamed after Graham, who co-produced this film incidentally, died in that crash with Stevie Ray Vaughn). I saw Phil Lesh there a couple months ago. The big outdoor scenes look like they were shot on Speedway Meadow in Golden Gate Park in SF. I've seen a lot of shows there, Graham used to use it for his free shows and they still do bluegrass festivals there every year. The place they used for the 'Whiskey' might have been the Red Devil Lounge but I'm not 100% sure on that. They also used the Warfield for some of the scenes when the Doors are supposed to be at their peak, that's the theater you see with the tiered balconies.For me the movie was mildly enjoyable because I do like some of the Doors songs and I liked the re-creation of the late 60s scene in L.A. and S.F. Another thing I liked was Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, I didn't recognize him until the performance was over, great job. The cast is really good in general actually. Val Kilmer was very good as Morrison considering there's so little to work with. Meg Ryan had a very tough character, people don't sympathize with a groupie like her. She did OK. Coincidentally both Wes Studi and Michael Wincott were in both this movie and 'Seraphim Falls' which I watched the same day. It made me realize how much I actually like Michael Wincott in particular, though I've never known his name until now.My main problem with the movie is just the fact that it seems to take for granted that we actually care about James Douglas Morrison. I guess we should give it credit for not straining too hard to make him out to be some kind of hero -- but then again we did get exposed to a montage that included images like Martin Luther King Jr. I don't know what the heck MLK has to do with Jim Morrison, it seems like the film is reaching for context. And all that stuff with the Native Americans, you get sick of seeing that in every Oliver Stone movie. Racial guilt is hardly a good emotion to pin your character on. Maybe I just don't get it. The image of the Native Americans are supposed to be tied to his death wish, to his idea of having a good death. As far as I can tell they got just as far in the lame movie Morrison made where he quoted Nietzsche. Either I'm really missing something, or Stone is pulling strings that he invented himself.",5,1,8,29 March 2008
Lost in Translation," Solid film produces unique results
","I was one of those who liked this film.  Part of the reason was that it was unlike any other film I've seen.  It is funny, it is occasionally sad as it focuses on isolation in the midst of crowds, sleeplessness in a comfy hotel room.  It is beautiful, but occasionally shows us the ugly side of Tokyo as well.  It makes us like the characters without shirking from their dark sides.Murray put in one of his best performances here.  He is utterly believable, playing a version of himself or a Steve McQueen style reclusive star forced by his financial obligations to a Japanese liquor company to spend a week in Tokyo.  Johannsen is showing herself off very well here.... this may well be the movie that makes her mark; at the very least she will have made some kind of lasting contribution to film that will be remembered in times to come.Not for fans of movies that dwell on 'action action ACTION!', more like Swedish 'slice of life' films or the Russian epics of Tarkovsky.",8,1,2,13 April 2004
Barry Lyndon," Classic costume epic may be Kubrick's masterpeice
","Kubrick at his very best, in a ponderous film about a less than heroic main character, Lyndon, who lets no human values get in the way of his quest for power and wealth.  The film doesn't let us simply dismiss the often unpleasant (to say the least) Barry, however, forcing us to sympathize with his dreams and the sadly human means he uses to find his personal immortality through the acquisition of titled nobility for himself and his progeny.  Kubrick almost lets his glorious picture of the period overpower the characters, but it is plausible that this was his goal.  A very adult period peice that blows away all Hollywood epics before and since, and pointed the way for James Ivory's superior efforts along the same lines.",10,5,8,15 February 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's ode to war and man
","War was the only subject really that Stanley Kubrick seemed to come back to over and over again. This film combines some of the satirical humor that made 'Dr. Strangelove' such a classic with the brutally objective eye that he trained on war in 'Paths of Glory.' It's a story of the making of a killer, from boot-camp to the wrecked urban landscape of Vietnam. Matthew Modine plays the primary character, 'Joker', and you'll also see Vincent D'Onofrio giving a wonderful performance as 'Gomer Pile' and R. Lee Ermey perfectly cast as the hard-ass drill instructor.But it's not really a movie about individual people, it's a movie about the loss of identity and individuality in the context of indoctrination and life-or-death struggles. As in Kubrick's '2001', the characters are only a mechanism for the themes of the film. It is a deliberately anti-melodramatic film that seeks to create its own formula. Like 'Barry Lyndon', its period recreations are incredibly faithful. The idea is more to transport you as the viewer into the environment, and not to allow us the easy separation between self and experience that a strong protagonist would have afforded us.The only real problem with the film is that there's no suitable ending, and what we do get by way of a conclusion is only a logical extension of the themes and doesn't really feel like it arises naturally from the material in any other way. I wish maybe something else could have been done to wrap it up, but I'm not sure what.Where other war films give us either heroism or villainy, this film is quite obviously about the 'duality of man', a phrase that even finds its way into the script. It views the phenomenon of war as just that, a natural product of the collective human imagination that follows its own rhythm and rules. And if there was no war, then what place would there be in the world for all these warriors we create? Sgt. Hartmann (Ermey) practically praises Lee Harvey Oswald for his sniping prowess, and another officer later ponders, 'when we rotate back to the States, we're gonna miss not having anyone worth shooting.'",9,5,9,9 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Less than incredible, more than mediocre
","Satisfying second installment of Lucas' new sci-fi fantasy series (based on the original Star Wars trilogy) manages to be full of top-notch action sequences while still feeling way too slow.  There is too much development of Anakin/Amidala's romance -- I could hear half the audience groaning with me when Lucas cut to the couple for the third time in a half hour, ridiculously posed before a fireplace.  Still, Christiansen is impressive at bringing out Skywalker's contradictory sides.  Unfortunately, Frank Oz's Yoda has been replaced by a CGI, but we do get to see him fight Christopher Lee (in perhaps the ultimate midget vs. Lee confrontation).  Also, there is pleasingly less Jar Jar Binks, and more of MacGregor's increasingly well-drawn Obi Wan.  The kid they found to play the young Boba Fett was magnificent -- you rarely see a kid actor get to play a TRULY bad kid, and this one has a good time of it.A very nice fantasy, but a bit too obvious, with clunky construction and ridiculous dialogue.",6,0,2,4 November 2002
Forrest Gump," why I think this movie stinks
","first of all, I've only seen this movie once, but I was actually very offended by it.  It takes itself far too seriously.  The commentary embedded in the film's core, relating to the 60s revolution and drug use in general, are shockingly naive, reactionary, and simple-minded.  This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as 'simple truths' much like its foggy-headed main character.  Not so.  It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues.  This movie is for people who voted for Reagan.",1,39,92,10 December 1998
10 Things I Hate About You," just OK
","I'm sure somebody has already come up with 10 things to hate about this movie, so I won't bother. Basically this is actually an easy movie to either hate or to love, but my reaction was more tepid amusement. It's a very typical teen comedy based on the plot structure of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' (like Cole Porter's 'Kiss Me Kate', but without good music). Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are both really fun to watch, but not really matched in quality by Larisa Oleynik or particularly by the underwhelming Julia Stiles. Stiles has the right face and mannerisms but we can't tell that there's actually supposed to be a human being inside. Ledger has most of the really memorable scenes; it brought a big smile to my face to see him crooning Motown hits over the PA system to his beloved.The movie is just good enough to entertain some kids and prevent adults from tearing their hair out. The soundtrack is one of the most annoying aspects by the way, as there are constant appearances by some blonde rocker who is apparently supposed to be a big deal. I can see why this movie might be great nostalgic fun for those who were in high school when it came out, but it had little to offer me.",5,6,14,1 March 2010
Burn After Reading," Zany caper without much heart
","Setting out to do what they do best, a zany caper film with bizarre characters and delicately acidic dialog, the Coens proved once again that they've been to this well a few times too often. Not that the film is terrible or that it's particularly worse -- but also not better -- than the average comedy of its type. The weight of the film's apparatus drags down its momentum; there are too many big-time actors playing cute and overemphatic character roles, too many 'look at this!' moments, and not enough real heart or appealing characterization to carry the thing through.The set-up is rather delicious -- a routine CIA analyst (John Malkovich) has his secrets stolen by his cold-hearted wife (Tilda Swinton) as part of a divorce investigation, and they end up in the hands of 2 ludicrously ambitious and foolish gym employees (Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand), who try to use the 'secrets' on the cd/rom to blackmail the CIA guy or get cash from the Russians. George Clooney plays a guy simultaneously having affairs with McDormand's character and Swinton's.Let's get the messy stuff out of the way first -- George Clooney is very funny in the movie, as he usually is in the Coen's films (although they all seem like one performance), but he was terribly and disastrously miscast in this film. There is just no way that a guy who looked like him would be trolling on the internet and picking up a woman who looks like McDormand, much less carrying on an ongoing affair with Tilda Swinton. I was wondering whether he had a fetish for unattractive women, since that would be the only thing that could explain his character's motivations considering how rich he was. Frances McDormand hasn't been particularly attractive since she was in her 20s (a lot of this movie stunk of Joel Coen's obvious and understandable blind spot in this department), and Tilda Swinton looked enough like a man when she was in her 20s to play one in 'Orlando.' It's just ridiculous -- there are plenty of other good actors who they could have cast who don't look like the reincarnation of Cary Grant, so they must have been trying to make a point by pairing Clooney with these women. But I can't really see what the point is -- if they were saying, 'this is how it really is in adult life', then they shouldn't have cast such a gorgeous leading man. It's true that in Hollywood you often see rather ordinary men paired with fabulously beautiful women, but there's not much point in reversing the trend just for the sake of being unconventional.Brad Pitt has some funny moments, the only parts of the movie where I laughed. But his character became annoying too after a bit too much screen time. The only character I could really relate to was McDormand's, but there was a bit too much obvious appeal from the directors to overcome the character's moronic behavior. Richard Jenkins gives a good performance as a sad-sack former priest who has fallen in love with the McDormand character, but the film-makers spend too much time making him sympathetic, to the point where it becomes manipulated as well. In the midst of these pathos-laden struggling 'little people' are all these relatively beautiful strivers and seekers who seem to have 2 dimensions only in their better moments. The Clooney and Malkovich characters are particularly void of any real emotion or interest.To put in a good word for the film, it's not quite as bad as 'Intolerable Cruelty'... but in the same territory. It doesn't degenerate towards the end into a much worse film like 'Cruelty', but it never really soars or pays off on the initial promise of the opening scenes, the cast and creative people and so forth. I think back to Gene Siskel's comments on 'Raising Arizona', about how none of the characters had any emotional weight or appeal, and although I never felt that way about 'Arizona' I feel like he described 'Burn After Reading' to a tee. The characters are all either smothered with emotion or left hanging as caricatures by the director(s) who've gotten too carried away with solid craft to pay attention to the larger purpose of the piece. When the Coen Brothers say in the 'bonus features' of the DVD that they concocted the story merely to support a handful of characters that they'd like to see played by Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, there's no evidence in the film that would contradict the claim. And it seems to me a risky and far from ideal way of making a story to entertain audiences. Putting dramatic actors in funny roles or funny actors in serious roles seems to delight the Coens, but this film sorely lacked real comedians. David Rasche was the only really funny guy in the movie, and he wasn't in enough of it.Hopefully the Coen Brothers are just sinking into a temporary rut, and they'll come back after this with something that holds together better. I'm starting to get the same feeling that I had when 'Hudsucker Proxy' and 'Fargo' came out, that the best days of the Coens are behind them.",4,5,10,19 January 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best film adaption of Tolkien so far
","Almost perfect fantasy film, only marred really by the inherently uncinematic nature of Tolkien's fantastic epic.  Good casting and performances, especially by the supporting cast.  Wisely, director Jackson utilizes Tolkien's often overlooked comedy in an admirably naturalistic way. One could have hoped for better and even prettier female leads, and the overall male-dominated tone (I heard a small girl, tell her mom 20 minutes into the movie: 'this is a male movie') make it an oddity in 2002.  The pictoral beauty of New Zealand, enhanced by computer animation, are amazing and are used effectively to express much of Tolkien's wonder at the world of nature which is shown in his novel, and this film even takes up his ecological theme with regard to Isengaard, which will of course be taken up further in 'Two Towers'.  An auspicious start.I liked particularly the art design, and the fact that the effects (including the monsters) were done with an eye to continuity in design, so that the effects don't 'jump out at you' like they do in most heavily CGIed movies.  The design reminded me a little bit of the silent germanic tradition, particularly in the mines of Moria and the tower at Isengaard.The only thing that I really don't like about this movie is the music: it's some of the worst movie music I've ever heard, ranging from Enya's insipid vocal dirges to wannabe-Wagner orchestral passages.  They could have done better even if they'd hired John Williams, for chrissakes.  Seems like they should've been able to do something, anything, better than what they did.",9,0,0,24 October 2002
The Caine Mutiny," One of Dmytryk's best
","Fairly straightforward story of a minesweeper ship in the U.S. Navy whose new captain, Queeg (Bogart) meets with a cool reception by his crew, driving him into paranoia and eventually a nervous breakdown.  He is relieved of command by his reluctant second-in-command (Johnson).  The second half of the movie is all about the court marshall.  Poor acting from the secondary principles, but MacMurray is particularly well-studied as the officer who is really most responsible for the mutiny.  Shows effectively how an event which may appear to be simple may in fact have any number of interpretations and causes.",7,2,3,4 October 2002
The Thing," Excellent fright-fest
","I've been a fan of this movie since I saw it on video in the mid-80s -- John Carpenter truly accomplished a miracle here, integrating old-school classy paranoia-scares that exemplified Hawks' 50s version of the Campbell story with state-of-the-art gore effects that are so well designed by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston that you almost feel as if you're looking at some kind of surrealist art instead of a sci-fi movie effect. It doesn't really have any sci-fi ideas in it, but it's such a good horror movie that even sci-fi fans won't complain.Kurt Russell plays a self-assured misfit in the company of other misfits, including a doctor played by Wilford Brimley. An extremely unfortunate encounter with a shape-shifting alien breaks down the bonds of human society and kindness and replaces them with the animal will to survive.Ennio Morricone provides a stripped-down score that could easily be mistaken for one of director Carpenter's own. Carpenter's directing is easily what makes the movie memorable. I mean, let's face it this movie has the same plot as 'Horror Express' and any number of horrible movies. In many ways it's obviously just an imitation of Ridley Scott's 'Alien.' But the Russell/Carpenter magic, this time for once played straight, redeems it as does Carpenter's effective suspenseful direction.There's not a lot to say about this movie in my opinion. It's just a good gory suspense/horror flick. It doesn't insult your intelligence but it also doesn't challenge it. The monochromatic color scheme was a good idea because it distinguishes it from other films from this period. Rob Bottin's effects are so gory and extreme that they make me laugh, yet this movie still has the strength to shock and terrify the impressionable. A worthy re-make that put the lie to all the nonsense about remakes being inherently bad, this film will probably outlive even the Hawks/Nyby original.",8,0,1,2 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter and the Steaming Pile of....
","Like the series of books upon which these films are based, the Harry Potter films continue to degenerate from their inception as a sometimes witty series of fantasy stories with mystery narratives into a character-oriented melodrama with a quest-based narrative. The formula becomes increasingly stale as we go on: will so-and-so find the object needed to unlock to the clue that is needed to unlock the horcrux or whatever the stupid thing is called to do.... something? Mix the tired narrative device with a story where one after another unimportant side characters are killed off and the audience is supposed to be stupefied with shock, and you have something that would really only appeal to fans and even at that the less demanding.Where there are solid moments in this film is in the comedy and character interactions, which Yates handles well. I often found myself laughing when the film took a breather: Harry and Hermione's awkward dance, Ron's constant protestations which somehow still seem funny, and so on. But the action scenes were bewilderingly directed. There is an entire 2 or 3 minute sequence towards the end when the 3 of them are chased through the woods by death eaters, that has basically zero informational value in any single shot. It's just blurred shots and shots of something moving really fast and cut to somebody's face in terror for 0.5 seconds and so on. This contrasts very poorly with the few action scenes, like the following one in the Malfoy castle, where you can actually see the characters and understand the action.The fact that the film has no ending is another annoying weakness, created by nothing more than the greed of the producers of this disappointing series. It becomes increasingly clear that the effort they put into the first bunch of films is just not there any more; their fish is hooked and they don't need to put out any more bait. The last few HP films have looked and felt cheap, like a cable TV movie with a slightly higher budget. Yates can do comedy but has no visual flair, and the actors are no longer developing or discovering their characters. It's sort of a routine now, for the movie makers and the audience. I can't say that I care for it but I'll finish the film series at least.",4,6,11,22 November 2010
Cold Mountain," Underwhelming pseudo-'Gone With the Wind'
","Not sure exactly what I was expecting with this film.... I went into it with a pretty open mind, but I was disappointed nonetheless. The story is just too flimsy to be believed, a very 19th-Century romantic story without much to back up the romance -- in fact more than once the main characters have to comment on how they had barely seen or spoken to each other, as if this makes up for the fact that their relationship is not established properly. I think the performances were generally good, if a bit over-sincere. Jude Law really made me feel for his character, and I was interested in his story as he trekked back to his love, though the episode with Portman fell flat for me, the sequences with Seymour-Hoffman made up for those. Zellwegger is great here, too, really appealing as the sort of tomboyish young woman who might actually have been found at that time in the South. One thing I also appreciated was that it gave a fairly balanced view of the average Southerner's take on the war.... in contrast to Hollywood's sometimes stereotyped approach. The battle sequences are excellent, but too short and falling only in the very early parts of the film. The big problem I had with the film was the unsubstantiated romance, along with some truly bad dialogue. It seems like the film-makers felt compelled to make a big statement on war when they really should have left their story a tragic romance and not tried to make it seem 'great'. The photography, however, is at times astounding, I particularly remember a shot of Law framed against a sunset early in the film that was quite beautiful.",5,0,1,5 July 2005
North by Northwest," One of Hitch's better flicks
","Somewhat overblown suspense thriller has exciting plot twists and Cary Grant's unique screen presence to recommend it.  Well directed, tells the story of an advertising man mistaken for a decoy created by the CIA, who is hunted across the nation and ends up falling for the CIA's undercover agent -- Marie-Saint.  The 'Open paranoia' scene in the cropdusting field is a great sequence.  Here Hitchcock succeeds often in not being obvious, remaining playful, and pleasing the audience a lot.I must respond to the comments I read on here by user 'tedg' -- I did not find them illuminating.  On the contrary, they seem to be the products of a confused mind, and someone who has not paid much attention to what he's saying before putting it in print.  First of all, as to his complaint about the quality of the sets, they are not as he claims 'junk' but actually well-made sets.  I'd like to see him, or anybody, given a lot of money create a duplication of the monument in question that would look better -- it just can't be done, because the monument itself is made of stone and took decades and millions of dollars to make.  Also, 'tedg' comments on the character played by Marie-Saint (hardly my favorite actress) -- he notes that she plays a 'prostitute' who is turned patriotic, but he doesn't seem to have been paying enough attention to the film to notice that in the end it is revealed that she is an undercover CIA agent, and not a prostitute at all.Users like this should definately not turn off their vcrs before the end of a movie if they're going to try to post thoughtful comments on it.",8,4,6,28 October 2002
Knowing," Alex Proyas' Waterloo
","Nic Cage gets knocked enough these days, so I'll go easy on him. He didn't do anything particularly great or noticeably bad in this film. There's a sort of generic quality to the way he plays a character, and it's very hard to believe that he's really some kind of physics professor, but those are small beans in the larger picture. For me, the film was really a disappointment when you consider it as a film not only directed by but produced by Alex Proyas.Cage plays an MIT professor, and the movie gets no more realistic from this point on. His son (Chandler Canterbury) receives a prophetic string of numbers in a school-related time capsule, and he believes that these prophecies must have come to him for a reason, perhaps so he could prevent the tragedies.Proyas has always seemed to have some amount of trouble with the conclusions of his movies. They never seem to deliver on the promise of his stylish philosophizing earlier in the films. In 'The Crow', that could perhaps be explained away by the premature death of his leading man, Brandon Lee. But even his best film, 'Dark City', devolves at a certain point into a rather standard effects driven action sequence. Usually a certain note of poignancy is added right at the very end which acts in some measure to redeem this. What we get in this film is a corny scene of the 2 kids being ushered into some nirvana place. I thought the film would have been much stronger if it had been more ambiguous in the end. No doubt is left in the audience's mind as to the fate of all these characters, including the children. I would have liked it better if it was more open ended. I thought it would be great if the 'whisperers' could be seen as either angels or devils. That would be closer to Arthur Clarke's 'Childhood's End', which seems to have been an inspiration to the writers (along with perhaps that old stand-by 'Chariots of the Gods', with its references to Ezekiel and UFO phenomena). The whisperers reminded me of the 'watchers' from 'Dark City', and I thought it would have been neat if it had been left open enough that I could imagine that they had actually kidnapped these children to take them into outer space for some kind of experiment. Maybe they shaved their heads and became the watchers. But the film slammed the door on that possibility and every other possibility as well.There is an atheist interpretation of this movie floating around as well as a theist interpretation. Neither of them makes complete sense because this movie doesn't make complete sense. If the whisperers were going to kidnap the kids in the mom's SUV anyway, then why did they go through all the stuff with the prophecies and the little black stones and all of that? If they are 'angels', then why do they go around dressed up like they're going to a NIN concert? It only makes sense internally, in terms of the logic of how the story unfolds, but it doesn't make sense when you try to put it all back together after the film is over. The only way I can make sense of it is in the theist interpretation: if the whisperers are biblical 'angels', and if they represent 'God', then their motives are incomprehensible. I detected a stronger Jewish religious theme in this movie than Christian -- this was the God of Job. The Cage character here lost his wife in a fire, a vague reference to the story of Lot. The film explicitly references Ezekiel. And in contrast to the Christian notion of apocalypse and salvation through Grace, these 'angels' only save those who have been chosen for what seem to be arbitrary reasons, and they torture those who they choose with prophecy and madness for no reason that can be rationalized in human reason (the Christian God is always reasonable, as if he were invented by Aristotle, but the Hebrew God is rarely logical).However the theist interpretation of the movie bores me and combined with the rather cut-and-dried ending of the film makes me feel like I've seen something closer to dogma than to scientific speculation. That's why the movie reminded me of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', another faux-SF movie that drapes itself in the clothes of science but is truly a story about faith. In an extremely awkward and obviously contrived scene set in Cage's classroom, we're presented with a naive dichotomy of the nature of the universe -- it's either completely random, or it has a logical order because God chooses what happens. However, naturalism actually holds that the universe proceeds along the lines of predictable physical causes and effects, the very opposite of the 'random.' What is actually 'random' is the idea of a God coming along and deciding to, say, put certain kids on a spaceship and repopulate the human race with them. But the movie would try to convince us of the exact opposite -- that a universe predicated strictly on natural law would somehow be inherently unpredictable because it has no 'purpose.' Please -- if you're going to make a SF movie, you have to give us science. Not ridiculous Nic Cage as an MIT professor who doesn't understand the basic tenets of science. The way I see this movie, it was an elaborate straw man argument.",3,2,7,29 April 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator returns for more carnage
","This film surprised me by not being terrible -- I guess that's not saying much, but neither is this movie; it's just trying to blow a lot of stuff up and be a fun summer movie.  As far as that goes, it's a success. Considering how many of the basic ideas here were plumbed by the first film, there's also a surprising amount to think about here.  Fundamental problems exist, however: for one thing, there is so much carnage and destruction in the first 40 minutes of the movie that nothing which follows after can top it.  Loken is not particularly memorable in the way the 2 previous Terminators were, but Stahl and Daines are fine as the new Connors/lover combo.  Arnold is his usual self, spiced here with a bit more humor than usual.Worth seeing, but only on an off night.",6,1,1,8 September 2003
The Orphanage," A deeply disturbing film experience
","Rarely do I go into the darkened cinema really expecting -- or even necessarily wanting -- to be truly scared by the movie I'm about to watch. There's every type of 'horror movie' experience out there, and I personally tend to prefer the kind where I really don't take anything too seriously, where I can wait for the next person to be killed by the monsters and laugh at the ridiculous way that it all happens. But 'El Orfanato' is not that type of horror movie. It is about people who you'd want to care about and even though the subject matter is supernatural at times there's a very real feeling about all the proceedings that put the film on another level from the typical scare-fest. I'm not going to say that the characters were completely compelling for me or that it was a great drama, but I would say that I got so wrapped up in the story and the suspense that watching the film eventually became a somewhat unpleasant experience. I'm a smoker and I've hardly ever felt so much like stepping out to calm my nerves in the middle of a movie, yet I didn't want to miss anything. Off the top of my head the only kind of experience I could compare this to was seeing 'Poltergeist' as a little kid in the theater, when the characters were kids exactly like me and their fears were the same as my own. There's also a sad quality to this film that reminds me of George Sluizer's 'Spoorloos' (aka 'The Vanishing').I won't go too deeply into the story, but it's a haunted house type of deal about a woman named Laura (Belen Rueda) who used to be a ward of a defunct orphanage which she and her husband (Fernando Cayo) decide to fix up to use as a home for children with special needs. Unbeknownst to himself, their own young son Simon (Roger Princep) is such a child, in his case he has been diagnosed with HIV at birth. Simon has imaginary friends who he plays with (like Danny in 'The Shining', the parents don't take it too seriously at first) and when he suddenly disappears without a trace Laura becomes convinced that his most recent 'friend' might be a ghost from the orphanage's past who has come back to haunt them.I was very impressed with all the performances and with the technical aspects of the film as well. The conclusion was very disturbing even if it doesn't make complete logical sense. I felt that the director did such a good job of establishing the mood of the setting that he was able to accomplish pretty much everything he set out to do as far as the suspense aspects of the film. There's a couple moments of out and out terror but for the most part it's the type of horror that fans of atmospheric horror will enjoy. There's even a theme of fantasy running through the film, a Peter Pan motif. So on the whole I enjoyed it but it sure isn't going to make anybody's lists of the feel-good films of 2008. In its more serious or personal aspects it's a meditation on the cruelty that we inflict on each other and through the medium of the supernatural it explores the ways in which we can deal with pain and suffering.A very effective horror film, one of the best I've seen in many years.",9,7,11,22 January 2008
Doctor Zhivago," Heavy production clashes with story
","David Lean directs the heck out of Boris Pasternak's novel, providing an opportunity for solid performances from a cast that includes Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger, and Alec Guinness (the latter giving one of his less impressive performances). Unfortunately, the story just doesn't really have enough weight to support Carlo Ponti's production, and Lean doesn't really seem to be helping because he obviously wants to top 'Lawrence of Arabia' even though the story here should be more intimate and personal. There are a number of action sequences that are a bit overblown -- the only one that really feels necessary is the scene of the Cossacks attacking the revolutionary activists. There's a particularly drawn out and overindulgent battle scene that takes place with horses on an icy lake, which exemplifies the film's tendency to make a big fuss over things that are not integral to the film's story. Jarre's theme is effective, but not very versatile.... it keeps reminding us that we're watching a love story. Sharif and Christie are excellent, Steiger holds his stuff down admirably, but most of the smaller roles (particularly Tom Courenay) come off all wrong.",6,2,4,17 February 2015
The Shining," A sense of failure
","Stanley Kubrick made one of his most commercial films based on this Stephen King story, and while it's not one of my favorite Kubrick films nor one of my favorite horror films I do think it's a very effective bit of cinema, and one that really used to chill me when I saw it as a kid. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall are both great in my opinion, though Nicholson sometimes is a bit too over the top. I even noticed in one scene where he seemed to be channeling Bruce Dern because his psycho act looked basically the same as Dern's in various biker movies they made together. Duvall's taken a lot of heat for the movie, but frankly people should take note of the fact that Kubrick never got a great performance from any actress in any of his movies. Maybe a lot of the problem is with Kubrick is what I'm saying and not with Duvall. Her work in the film seems perfect to me -- in the beginning she's the very image of a co-dependent, making expert excuses for her husband's abuse of their son, and when Jack has his melt-down she goes into a very convincing 'mama bear' mode protecting her son above herself.I'd like to talk about some of the themes in the book that draw from both King's work and Kubrick's work in general. First of all there's this prevalent image of the corridor, both in the hallways of the Overlook Hotel and also in the hedge labyrinth (and references back to corridor shots in '2001' and even as far back as 'The Killer's Kiss'). I think the sense of this image is that freedom of movement and freedom of thought are to a certain extent an illusion. When you're moving down a corridor you're under your own volition, but there's only one direction you can actually move in without turning back. And don't turn to the side, don't think you can go into room 237 to find some kind of escape or release. It's important that the image is of Danny on a 'big wheel' tricycle; those were very popular at the time and I'm about the same age that Danny was supposed to be and for us kids in the late 70s those big wheels were like the equivalent to how kids from the 50s talk about cars when they were grown ups. Heck I can still remember this feeling of freedom when I would ride my big wheel around the cul-de-sac, and I remember one time when I was very small crying because someone had parked their car out so far in the drive-way that I couldn't get around them without going into the street. So there's this feeling of freedom associated with the big-wheel, and yet it's a kind of illusory freedom, just like the corridor itself.It all ties into the sense of personal failure that seeps through the cracks of the Torrance family. And Jack is a man who feels very much trapped in his family, that his needs as an individual have been sacrificed for its sake. He finds something he loves even more in the Overlook, and thinks that he has chosen this path even though it must have been chosen for him; of the two men in the family who have 'the Shining', he's clearly the less talented and the one that the Hotel could manipulate more easily. The mania takes the form of an obsession with the fact that he has 'signed a contract' to take care of the Overlook and that he sees the rest of the family as an obstacle to that 'sacred trust' -- yet he doesn't even take the time to keep the generators running, he lets his wife do all that actual work. So he's not truly concerned about the 'trust' but moreso the fact that it allows him to believe that he has chosen his path instead of having it chosen for him. His aspirations as a writer, his failed attempt at a teaching career, and finally as a father he has ended up a failure. Danny's mental problem and his fainting spells become a symbol of personal failure -- there's a feeling when Wendy is talking to the social worker for example that Danny's problems are the result of parental abuse or neglect. Gradually Danny himself becomes for Jack a visible reminder of his personal failure, and the 'contract' with the Overlook becomes a kind of salve or a way of 'correcting' the failure.Scatman Crothers' character is also very interesting. It's similar to in 'Misery' (spoilers) how King has the character played by Richard Farnsworth solving this mystery all through the story only to get waxed by Kathy Bates as soon as he solves it. So it's a King trademark, but Kubrick certainly could have chosen to ignore the character so it's interesting that it's so prominent. One thing is that I think it allows again for an illusory feeling of freedom; we're snow-bound and cooped up with the Torrances for so much of the film that every time we see Crothers (lounging in his decadent condo in Miami, flying on a jet liner) it's a breath of fresh air and freedom, of the outside world. But it proves to be an illusion because he can't save Danny and Wendy, no 'outside influence' is going to decide the fate of these characters.When I've seen the movie on the big screen, it still has the power to shock and scare an audience. I remember seeing it in Sacramento in the middle of the afternoon and the audience came out of the theater looking shell-shocked. On video it feels more intimate and I tend to see it that way less as a good horror film than as a good character study. Either way it's a very interesting movie even if it never achieves quite the heights that Kubrick is capable of.",8,0,2,11 February 2008
"I, Robot"," Decent sci-fi, frenzied action
","I saw this one originally at the Sacramento Six drive-in, but had missed the beginning of the movie so this was my first complete viewing. It's a decent enough sci-fi movie, providing more ideas than most big budget affairs that go by the name. As an action movie I find it slightly underwhelming. A few of the fight scenes go on too long, and like Alex Proyas' earlier and superior sci-fi 'Dark City' it becomes relatively formulaic towards the climax after starting off a bit more promising.Many parts of this film, especially the scenes with Del (Will Smith) and his grandmother (Adrian Ricard), feel like they are some kind of obligatory nod to Smith's screen persona. However Smith's presence on the whole is a major asset to the film. I like him here as much as I've liked him in anything. He's able to seem invulnerable and yet sensitive at the same time, no mean feat. Later on in the story we find out a plausible reason for why he acts this way, in that he is himself partly mechanical, but he's already conveyed it very well through his character work. The scenes with Smith and Shia LaBeouf feel pretty artificial as well, at best causing one to chuckle but seeming very forced into the story. They even have to interrupt the big chase towards the end so Smith can save LaBeouf. I have a feeling that the writers felt like the audience might be turned off or feel insulted or patronized by the fact that everyone except Del Spooner is so complacent about the robots, so they felt they had to almost overcompensate with the big human vs. robot street rumble at the end which is pretty silly. How would a mob of angry New Yorkers line themselves up in formation like an army and attack the robots in such an organized way? It should be more chaotic and riotous.The core of the movie is the 3-some of cop Del, Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynihan) and the robot Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). That part of the movie does work very well. The audience is inclined to distrust the robot just like Del, and the character becomes sympathetic and even admirable by the end of the story. In the sense that they tied this character process to the intellectual question of the distinctive aspects of the soul, it gives the movie a solid foundation.It's interesting perhaps to note that even 10 or certainly 20 years before this film was made, you would never have seen a black star in a sci-fi role like this. There's nothing in the story that requires the character to be black, although it does make the theme of Del's prejudice against robots seem ironic. There's also nothing in the relationship between Del and Dr. Calvin that would require her to be a woman. So it's kind of nice to see the movie cast this way, it makes me think how far we've come even just in my lifetime as far as sci-fi heroes. I like the character anyway, I like how he is a guy who collects 'antiques' from our time; it helps the audience connect with him and it's a good device to keep Smith in his comfort zone as far as style as well.Unfortunately this film seems among Proyas' films more close to 'The Crow' than to 'Dark City' -- there's more style than substance here ultimately. And Proyas isn't afraid to cater to the audience's demand for a video game paced action scene every 8 minutes or so. But I suppose that's the price of working with such a large budget and such a skilled cast and crew. The effects work in this film is really astounding, although these days that's getting to be almost a matter of course. Proyas mixes the action with just enough ideas to create a movie that is less than an embarrassment to Asimov's original. The closing shots with the robot on the hill have a weird quality to them and a very ambitious idea behind them that redeems the affair also to some extent from the rather silly fight scenes that immediately precede them. In the end, I'm surprised by how good it ended up being and still hoping that Alex Proyas has more great sci-fi to bring us in the future.",7,1,2,16 April 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," scores a bit, misses a bit
","This is an interesting comedy; it dips its feet into the waters of the most ridiculous, yet never really ceases to take itself seriously. Perhaps that's because the bio-pictures of which it is a spoof are themselves so insufferably self-serious. This one pokes fun at most of them, as far as I can tell. The hippy period of Bobby Darin is spoofed through a Dylan-esquire song by Cox, he shows up on acid at a kiddie party like Jim Morrison in 'The Doors'. But most of it is from the more recent duo, 'Walk the Line' and 'Ray.' Unfortunately a lot of the spoof is pretty obvious -- he tears up some bathrooms in an excessive way, and he has a 'smell blind' condition that troubles him. Also like Ray Charles he has a huge number of children, but this film actually shows them all.John C. Reilly is the main element that holds the thing together and keeps it from being boring. He did a good job at conveying a rockabilly hard-ass and the character grew more appealing as he grew older. Still this is all in a formula outside of the one that the film is spoofing -- the increasingly obvious and by the numbers Judd Apatow sentimentalist approach, rapidly growing into John Hughesian territory.The songs themselves are rarely funny in and of themselves, although that could be a plus -- like the famous 'Spinal Tap', these are songs that you could *almost* imagine being real hits. I really laughed at the song about little people and Cox's advocacy for little person rights, so obviously an opportunistic ploy. Most of the songs could have been just a bit funnier though, and I wouldn't have minded. The film in general is more like to bring a smile or a chuckle than a good hearty laugh, so I would recommend it only with some reservations.",5,0,0,12 January 2009
Duck Soup," Comedy feast sublime!
","Unusual comedy of errors set in a mythical kingdom populated by stodgy characters whose lives are turned around by the Brothers Marx; the Bros. are spies, and Groucho is the appointed rulesr of a tiny European nation.  I like the title sequence with the ducks a lot.  Not the Marx Bros. best film, certainly not their worst.",7,1,3,9 October 2002
Edward Scissorhands," Excellent romantic drama
","I love this movie, not so much because it's my favorite Tim Burton movie, but it's really the first one that he did which you can tell nobody else but Burton would have made. Previously he managed to find material that suited him well and that he could import some of his style to. But this story really feels like Burton all the way through, from the wonderful casting of Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp and Vincent Price to the visual scheme of the movie and the whole theme of the misunderstood outsider, only temporarily redeemed by art.Edward Scissorhands (Depp) is the unfinished creation of a classic style 'mad' doctor (Price). When the Avon Lady (Dianne Wiest) comes calling and finds the boy all alone, she takes him down to her house and tries to help him fit in with what passes for normal life in the suburbs. He falls for her preppy daughter (Ryder) and gets into a conflict with her jock boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall). While temporarily becoming a celebrity due to his unique hairstyles and lawn decorations, Edward's freakish nature and his innocent and underdeveloped emotions eventually cause the neighborhood to turn against him en masse like the villagers in 'Frankenstein.' Under about 100 layers of makeup and prosthetics, Depp manages to turn in a very poignant performance as Edward mostly thanks to his ability to emote with his eyes like a silent actor. Ryder, who's been discarded by Hollywood in recent years, shows the kind of qualities that made her one of the few true teen stars of her time. The parents, played by Wiest and Alan Arkin, provide some of the film's most hilariously low-key moments of situational comedy. Arkin seems like the type of guy who doesn't really understand anything that's happening around him, but who has a graceful acceptance of the degree of chaos that his do-gooder wife brings to the family.There's a brazen sort of coloratura in the extreme contrast between the pastel burbs and the perpetually dark and stormy castle that seems to exist right in the heart of town (without anyone taking much notice of it). In a sense it's the uneasy marriage of the comfortable Gothic beauty of 'Batman' with the crazy funhouse colors of 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.' The film's success really depends on one's willingness to accept the romance between Ryder and Depp, which develops without much narrative or dramatic impetus. It can in a sense be seen as a deep flaw in the film, since it's hard to see Ryder's initial warming-up to Depp's character as anything other than pity. Accepted on its own terms however, the story is as tragic as anything Hollywood has turned out in the past few decades. Edward is this guy who absolutely cannot have any contact with human beings without accidentally scarring them. The premise of the movie would indeed fall apart if Burton and his writers had tried to force a happier conclusion.",8,0,0,13 September 2009
Dreamgirls," Bill Condon, back in my good graces
","This is one of the more engaging film musicals that I've seen from the past few decades. The music is catchy, the lyrics are intelligent and enhance the story and characters, and the performances are all very good. Jennifer Hudson steals the show of course, as everybody told me she would. I was also impressed with Jamie Foxx, Danny Glover, and surprisingly Eddie Murphy whom I usually don't care for. The director Bill Condon has been quite up and down -- I thought 'Gods and Monsters' was a masterpiece, one of the best films of the 1990s. But 'Kinsey' was very turgid and pointless, and 'Dreamgirls' was a very different type of thing than what I've seen him before so I wasn't sure how he would make it work. His directorial touch here is very light but effective. He has done a very good job of enhancing the appearance and performances of his stars while keeping the film's pace moving along, communicating all the information and emotion that he needs to without belaboring any points.There is an extra deleted scene on the DVD which shows 'Stepping to the Bad Side' done with a much longer introduction where the three male characters sing in character. I wish that this had been included in the main film, because as it is the integration doesn't really begin until we see Jennifer Hudson's character about to leave the group. That does make that particular scene more startling, but I would have liked a bit more songs done in-character before that point. Most of the early songs are performance pieces, with the singers doing the songs on stage that tangentially relate to the story but nothing very direct or dialog-oriented.I would rate the film much higher if it weren't for the bogus ending. That had me throwing my hands up in despair, it really did. I guess it's their business if they don't want to make this a tragedy, but it really didn't ring true with everything else we'd seen in the movie. The sense of redemption for the Foxx character was very incomplete, even forced. I didn't care much for Knowles' character or her performance either, and at times it felt like more attention was being paid to her character just to justify her star presence. But hey, I did like her scene with John Lithgow. Something about Bill Condon, he loves putting John Lithgow in these strange wigs and having him play very odd characters, as he did also in 'Kinsey.' I am just very happy that this movie was made, and that I saw it. It's wonderful that we're in an age where black performers can really solidify a hit like this, on a regular basis and not just the occasional 'Wiz' here and there. The film even has the audacity to question the value of the disco explosion and to reveal how soul music was perverted into machine music for commercial profit. It made me wonder what would happen to all these characters in the 1980s....",7,2,4,7 June 2009
Spider-Man," The best superhero film of all time? Maybe
","An extraordinary example of the superhero genre of action films -- it manages to create in the audience a sympathy with Peter Parker (Maguire), the high school student turned 'Spider-Man', as well as a sense of shared, vicarious joy as spidey discovers his tremendous powers.  The movie is fun and funny, Raimi providing a fast-moving arena for the excellently realized CGI spidey to do his tricks (just watching it made me want to go buy the game for X-box, but I haven't gotten around to it yet).  He must face the Green Goblin, his classic foe, played to a 2-sided malicious tee by Dafoe, whose character doubles as a big-time weapons manufacturer.  Dunst and Franco are merely adequate.  That rare kind of superhero film that left me itching for the sequel -- bring it on, Marvel!",8,1,2,15 February 2003
Dark City," One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen
","What I'd personally like to focus on is the theme of the fluidity of identity, a strong theme explored in many great works of fantasy and fiction in general, film noir in particular (e.g. 'The Scar', 'Tension,' 'Gilda'). Here we have a brilliant twist on the old amnesia story  our hero John Murdock's (Rufus Sewell) memories weren't lost because of some trauma or neurosis/psychosis, but rather he never had those memories because he actually avoided a trauma and a neurosis tailor-made for him by alien interlopers called The Strangers. In the course of the film the characters piece together reality from the bits left behind every night by the Strangers. The crux of the story is the same as the object of the Strangers' experiment  the nature of the human soul, specifically free will, the role that experiences or conditioning play in our decision making process. If you give a regular man the memories of a serial killer, will he continue to act as a killer or to what extent will his 'nature' assert itself? The Strangers do realize that man is more than the sum of his experiences, but they need to know what exactly causes that difference. It really gets interesting when one of the Strangers, Mr. Hand, injects himself with the memories that were supposed to be John Murdock's, and actually becomes the killer. Taking up Mr. Ebert's suggestion that Mr. Hand represents the Jungian dark self or shadow of the hero (a fairly obvious conclusion), the film seems to be making a refreshingly optimistic statement about the importance of the conscious rational mind over and above the irrational unconscious.This film seems at first overly stylized and derivative, but after the secret is revealed we realize why this is so  heck you could even argue that the Strangers watched 'Metropolis,' 'Naked City' etc. and formed their ideas about human society through them though such a conceit is hardly necessary: the Strangers are drawing from various epochs in human history and perhaps they are deliberately trying to give the humans an atmosphere both recognizable and alien. After all, if you were seeking the mystery of the soul it would hardly do to simply look at one period of time or one particular culture. It's also clear the director is using the image of the circles not just as a metaphor for the story and the process of self-discovery that forms the core of the drama, but also as a way of explaining how and why the city was built. The city might resemble aspects of both the 'real' and 'romantic' 1940s  1960s city simply as a result of the natural process of adding up and combining all the pieces of memory and impression used as building blocks in its creation. Form mirrors content upon accumulation of details, in other words.I also really agree with Ebert's point that the reason some of these performances might seem shallow is because here we have actors who are working with characters that don't have any real memories. As such, method acting would actually be inappropriate. I like the idea that they are forming their real personalities based on the experiences they've actually had in real life, which is to say the events we've seen in the film itself. I had an interesting event that happened to me the other day that sheds some light on this, for me anyway. I went into my favorite burrito place here in Oakland, a place I visit almost every week. I walked through the restaurant and went up to the counter to order my food, and then someone slapped me on the back. I turn and see one of my best friends in the world standing there laughing. And it occurred to me later  how could I possibly not see my best friend sitting there at the table? It's because we're in 'city-mode' when we're moving about the city doing things  very focused on what we're doing and adopting a sort of glazed indifference to the chaos around us as a defense mechanism. And thinking about this movie, it seems to me that what we're seeing is really an exaggerated version of the normal reality of city life such as what I experienced the other day. Consider how the other characters in the story don't even think about the fact that they don't have any specific memories and can't tell anyone how to get to Shell Beach. They are just more or less doing what they need to do, running through the maze the Strangers have set up for them. Go into the automat, push the button, get what you need. Sadly this is very recognizable I'm sure to most people today, particularly those of us who live in the city. This film is reminding us to stay awake and constantly question authority and reality. It is also reminding us of how much of life and reality we miss every day simply by getting so focused on our own immediate needs and fears. These characters in this story pass each other in the night  they really do touch each other, even through the fog of cynicism and predatory sex and violence that lie at the heart of Dark City and film noir itself. And to whatever extent the film is successful, they touch us as well. I don't think the film was trying to make a metaphysical/philosophical argument, but simply to remind us (as did some of the best episodes of 'Twilight Zone' and the film 'Blade Runner') that there's more to being human than simply satisfying our needs and wants, even though living in the city sometimes it feels like that's all anyone is capable of.",9,7,10,13 December 2007
Gandhi," solid history lesson
","Had never seen this movie until this week, probably because I suspected it would just be one of those sanctimonious emotional films that feels more like an advertisement for a political figure than a real movie with actual characters. But I was really pleased with the way that the director and Kingsley managed to make Gandhi into a real flesh and blood human being, one who we could admire without feeling that he was remote or too perfect for reality. It was Gandhi's humility that really got to me, how when the Martin Sheen reporter character told him he was an ambitious man he said, 'I hope not.' Of course I couldn't have spent all these years talking and reading about film without hearing the Legend of Ben Kingsley. That he was so great in this movie, that it was one of the best performances, etc. But at least up until I saw 'Sexy Beast', I had never really been impressed with him as an actor. I doubted his ability to restrain his energy, even (or especially) after 'Beast.' But ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't have been more wrong. He's wonderful in the role and watching him is a delight in and of itself. The Indian actors who play in support roles are also really excellent, and I especially enjoyed Roshan Seth as Nehru and Rohini Hattangadi as Gandhi's wife. I think they should have been billed higher, but whoever was paying for the movie obviously felt like they needed Candice Bergen's name up there as if to tempt the audience with sex appeal. Bergen adds almost nothing to the movie with her typically cardboard performance, and Geraldine James is barely an actress at all.I wouldn't say it's a really great movie overall though. The style that Attenborough uses is exceptionally dry and straightforward. I don't think a director with more 'flourish' would necessarily have made a better film, and in fact it would have been a huge risk, but it kept the movie from being what it could have been as a piece of cinema. Compare it to David Lean's style in 'Lawrence of Arabia' or Edward Zwick's style in 'Glory' and it seems a bit dull. The other thing was that it seemed like the screenwriters had gone to great efforts to make sure that there were white characters on screen at all times. It seemed very contrived to me, having this whole scene where Gandhi tells the priest (Ian Charleston, who was also scandalously under-billed considering the importance and quality of his performance) that he has to leave because whatever is done must be done by Indians, and then there's really no explanation as to why he's bringing this British woman to India to help him take care of his house. Then just as the movie is coming to a close, we have Candice Bergen strutting around flirting with Gandhi and it sets a very odd tone to some scenes that probably could have been done better with a more serious actress. You have John Gielgud in a role that could just as easily have been played by just about anybody. So there's a lot of wasted talent in a sense, and all these actors getting top bill over some of the people who had real roles in the film leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Not enough however to really over-ride my overall enthusiasm for this film, which has a handful of really exceptional scenes at least to make it worthwhile. At the very least, it made me want to learn more about Gandhi, who I never had much interest in as an esoteric religious leader but who seems much more interesting as a human being.",8,0,1,31 May 2009
Duck You Sucker," 100 proof dynamite action film by genre master Leone
","Excellent action film with Steiger over-the-top but Coburn right on the money as bandit/revolutionaries in Mexico.  More gunfire and explosions and less balmy confrontations than in other Leone pics.  I'm stuck on a second viewing by how much of a '70s' film this is, and how much real cinematic value and interesting ideas Leone has put into the film despite its basic action-film plotline.  Rumors say Malcolm MacDowell was the original lead -- very intriguing possibility.  The look on Steiger's face after he finds out he's risked his life to rescue a bunch of dirty prisoners is priceless.",9,37,51,9 October 2002
Tropic Thunder," very funny -- Stiller's best work on film
","Ben Stiller has always been more interesting as a writer and director than simply as a comedy personality. 'The Ben Stiller Show' was one of the sketch comedy gems of the 1980s although it got canceled right after I discovered it, and although also not hugely successful he showed with 'Zoolander' that he could be irreverent and very funny on the big screen as well. I thought 'Tropic Thunder' was even more irreverent, almost anarchic, and more entertaining than 'Zoolander.' The kind of 'laugh out loud' moments that seem to elude him to some extent in 'Zoolander' are peppered much more evenly throughout this film. And just as 'Zoolander' was basically about the shallow aspects of celebrity culture in America, so too this film has fun with the pretensions of actors and their relative self-seriousness. For example the character of the agent (played by Matthew McConaughey, but written for Owen Wilson) is so absurdly dedicated to his job of getting his client a TIVO device that one would think that his life depended on it - then to throw us for a loop the scene towards the end is contrived where Stiller's character is actually saved by the TIVO.The film is full of great cameo performances, such as Tom Cruise channeling Joe Pantoliano (I thought it actually was Pantoliano until the final moments of the film) playing an agent character somewhat similar to Jerry Stiller's character in 'Zoolander.' But it's really got a good heart in the primary group of characters played by Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, and Brandon Jackson. The fake trailers at the beginning of the movie were perfect -- they got the audience roaring with laughter and also introduced the basic differences between the 4 actors, or is that the character of the actors? Some of the lines are blurred here, as Downey's character in particular strikes us as a parody of his own actual career (in one hilarious scene we see him on a balcony with a bottle of tequila giving fans the middle finger). It definitely would not be the same movie with Downey Jr. and Stiller being so perfect for their roles and essentially spoofing their own careers.McConaughey is the biggest surprise of the movie... I just have never found him amusing at all before in any of the chick flick comedies he makes. He was excellent here and really cut loose.Just like with Zoolander's glamorization of bi-sexuality and tendency to mock even seemingly innocuous aspects of our culture, this is a film that will probably offend everyone. And that's fantastic. I can't stand how 99% of Hollywood comedies these days are basically 'safely offensive.' You can make any number of fart jokes and turd jokes, and people are happy to be offended by that. But this film is even more extreme than 'Zoolander' as far as shaking up conservative culture -- the film mocks the acclaim that goes to actors who play 'retards', for example, and the obscenely patronizing way that African Americans are often portrayed in film. Certain aspects of our culture just beg to be lampooned, but Stiller has a way of finding things like this that are hilarious but which make people far more uncomfortable. Most writers would not give themselves a character who murders a Panda Bear. It's not a conservative measure of 'irreverance', it's more like Stiller's taking things into Monty Python territory. No one and nothing is safe.My only slight or faint reservation about the movie is that for a film that mocks 'stunt casting' so much, it sure indulges in quite a bit of it especially with Tom Cruise in all that makeup. And I even hear faint 'Oscar Buzz' for Downey Jr. I don't think the Academy would touch this movie with a 100 foot pole, but it plays into the fact that the movie actually provides some interesting character acting in the context of a movie that seems to mock such pretensions. I'm still unsure if that's a brilliant aspect of the film or merely a casually inconsistent one.",8,2,4,27 October 2008
Legends of the Fall," Solid pioneer drama
","Director Zwick takes elements that could be very forgettable (like the recent 'Cold Mountain') and turns them into a very engaging story about a frontier family torn apart by jealousies and pride. Only the film's tidy ending lowers it somewhat from being an excellent film.The story concerns a former warrior in both the Civil and Indian Wars, Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) after he settles down in the Dakota territory to raise his 3 sons. Bright, well-educated and well-groomed son Samuel (Henry Thomas) brings home a lovely and also well-groomed fiancé Susannah (Julia Ormond) just before heading off to fight for France in WWI on an idealistic impulse that his father opposes. His other 2 brothers accompany him -- one older and feeling himself to be the most responsible, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and the other younger and more wild Tristan (Brad Pitt), whose habits and inclinations match the adventurous spirit of his namesake. After Sam is killed in action, the other 2 brothers begin a decades long battle over Susannah's love which divides the family and brings great sadness to everyone's lives.The performances are reasonably well done. Hopkins is always good as a rough former gentleman, and I found his defensive attitude when his sons decide it is their duty to go to war very well done. I also have to admire his work in the second half of the film after a stroke has left his character unable to move the right side of his body. Hopkins' performance becomes more intense and sad as his character recedes more and more into old age. Ormond was suitable but little more.... not only was the character written so that we can't really understand why she ends up marrying Alfred despite being in love with Tristan, but she does little to add to the mystery with her understated way of showing depression later in the film. Quinn does the best work of the 3 sons -- the picture clearly emerges of a man who is trying hard to do the right thing and feels intolerable pain at the fact that his father and even his wife feel more love for the less reliable and amoral Tristan regardless. There are many points in the story where we don't like Alred, but for the most part Quinn enables us to see the character's actions through his own eyes. Pitt's performance varies from very effective to somewhat unconvincing depending on the nature of the scene he's playing. I thought his sadness over Samuel's death was very convincing, but I never 100% bought into the notion that he was so uncivilized that he would just run off for years without leaving a trace or sending word. I never really bought that he was this Davy Crockett type pioneer guy. Part of that is physical and can't be blamed on Pitt -- he's just too pretty to believe that he never sleeps on a bed. There are also some good supporting performances, particularly Gordon Tootoosis who puts in time as a former chieftain who Ludlow has more or less adopted. His presence greatly aids Pitt's attempts to appear as a kind of free spirit of the wild.The film's great strength is in the direction, which distracts the audience from various points that might have seemed cliché. The director's focus is on his characters and he never lets attention wander to the landscape or the scenery for too long, despite the excellent production values.The film's greatest weakness is the fact that distraction would be possible at all, or that you would need such good photography and direction to cover up the somewhat obvious nature of the script. (SPOILER) The death of Tristan's wife was the only real shocker for me, and everything after that point including Alfred's rejoining the fold in the final shoot-out was somewhat predictable.Overall, a very good film of its type.",7,0,1,5 March 2007
No Country for Old Men," Not a bad movie, but not one of the Coens' best
","The last time the Coen Brothers got serious attention from the Academy, it was for 'Fargo', a mid-western rehash of their first feature 'Blood Simple.' Now they've gotten a lot of attention from various awards for doing another psycho-murder film in Texas, equally inferior to 'Blood Simple' as well as many of their intervening films including 'Barton Fink', 'The Big Lebowski', and 'The Man Who Wasn't There.' It's not that it's a bad movie in and of itself, and it's better than the other recent Coen Brothers movies I've seen, but it seems strange that these guys only seem to get the correct amount of attention when they make a relatively meaningless crime movie as opposed to their satirical masterpieces.At any rate, I read a few reviews before seeing the movie (skipping past the plot summary because I didn't want it to be spoiled) and some of the reviewers said that the Coen Brothers had finally 'grown up' in this movie. The reviewer for 'Newsweek' (David Ansen?) commented on how the film had seemed to drop the Coens' reliance on humor even in their 'serious' films. I didn't see this at all. The best parts of the movie for me were the typically off-beat and morbid humor scenes, like Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) drinking the killer's (Javier Bardem) milk and telling his clueless deputy that drinking milk isn't a sufficient description of a suspect to put out an APB on. I like the vernacular of the script, and I like Jones' and Josh Brolin's performances very much. But I didn't quite see what the fuss was all about Javier Bardem's performance, it was pretty simple work I thought compared to what Brolin had to do. He just had the juicier role, that's all.The story here is pretty gripping, but ultimately goes nowhere. Probably the thing that impressed the critics the most and made them say the Coens 'grew up' (as if this movie compares on an intellectual level to their best films, which as far as I can tell on a first viewing it does not) was that the film had an ambiguous ending. But it's not ambiguous in an interesting way like 'Barton Fink', it's just ambiguous as if they didn't know how else to end it. There's no real idea here to justify the violence. The violence is done in a very exaggerated way to make Bardem's character more impressive. It's not much more subtle than your average action movie if truth be told. I guess we're just supposed to walk away remembering the scene with Jones and the older man, we're supposed to think about how Jones feels like he's over-matched by the criminals but it's actually the same kind of thing that people had to deal with back in the old west days. That's hardly a good idea to pin a whole movie on.Another problem I had with the movie is a whole host of uninteresting characters. The Woody Harrelson character has nothing important to do and seems to be here just a a link between the killer and his corporate employers. He does a half-assed version of the same character M. Emmett Walsh played much better in 'Blood Simple.' Poor Kelly McDonald seems like a good actress but had absolutely nothing to work with until her final scene with Bardem. You can see the seams of the plotting of the story showing through. Some of the scenarios are just ridiculous. The bag of money is supposed to have this tracking device in it, one that makes a loud beeping noise when it's taken out of the bag and which is quite large but which for some reason Brolin never hears or thinks to look for until he's already been tracked down twice. If the movie wasn't so well made technically speaking, these things could just be dismissed as action movie conventions, but this film should be so much better.I can't rate the film as a bad film because the suspense is pretty gripping and the action scenes are well done. Josh Brolin's character is very well done. I really liked the early parts of the film, Deakins' photography of the animals on the plains, the suspense of Brolin encountering the scene of the drug battle. The movie starts going downhill immediately when he goes back to try to give the guy water, a boneheaded move that pushes the movie into ridiculous territory almost right away. It's not a bad thrill ride but I think people are reading things into it that aren't there.",6,3,6,16 March 2008
District 9," Decent sci-fi, could have been retooled
","Directors and writers love allegory, because it allows them to make 'significant' films while delivering the goods for audiences. Thus an anti-blacklist message is slipped into the water supply by way of a Gary Cooper western ('High Noon'). Then later it's turned into a sci-fi movie ('Outland') with very little allegory. But that's not to say they haven't tried it in sci-fi; 'Enemy Mine' and 'Alien Nation' beat 'District 9' to this particular punchbowl about 20 years ago, basically rehashing the old race/buddy-cop formula from films like 'In the Heat of the Night' for the sci-fi audience. That black people would probably prefer not to be allegorized by way of hideous mutant freaks has hardly been questioned.But an attempt at an interesting sci-fi premise is still better than the lazy premises we usually see. The people who made this movie actually seem more enamored of Verhoeven's style in 'Starship Troopers' than any of those other films. But there's an odd clash of humor and drama here in my opinion that really doesn't always work. It starts out as a mockumentary and gradually morphs into a rather conventional narrative/action-film. In the process, identification is built but satire is unhinged.Honestly, although the mockumentary style is interesting to apply to sci-fi, I thought it was pretty poorly done here. First of all there's the fact that it drops away and returns seemingly at the whim of the director. This dulls the impact of both the documentary and non-documentary sequences, because there's no sustained illusion of either objective or subjective reality. And then too much of the documentary parts are strictly informational; you wonder if anyone but a 5 year old in this alternate-Earth would really need some of this basic information about the arrival of the aliens.The implausibility continues, and actually amps up, as the film progresses. Our hero, presented as a dorky bureaucrat, turns out to be the reincarnation of Jean Claude Van Damme. He thinks nothing of using his cell phone or walking into a fast food joint, and although all the military-police in town are supposedly searching for him he always eludes them on foot. He easily escapes from a high-security research center, and then spends the next half hour trying to convince his alien friend that it's impossible to get back in. Of course he decides to try it, and then breaks back in even more easily because his employers never thought to change the codes. Escape is not difficult a second time, because even though the evil corporation knows that he's inside they don't bother to close the garage or post more than one guard there.These are all just bumps in the road; the major disappointment is that what promises to be both a stylish and intelligent sci-fi film instead degenerates into typical popcorn action. In this way it's similar to films like Alex Proyas' 'Dark City.' The mixture of satire and sentiment leaves a bad taste in my mouth -- too much is done with an eye to the momentary payoff and not the larger structure. It feels like the project was rushed, that there were good ideas in here but the script needed more work.",6,2,4,8 February 2010
Batman Begins," Batman Begins again
","We've all seen this movie before, at least I have, so it better be pretty darned interesting. It's not horrible, but not good enough to really justify all the talent that went into it. I first saw this movie a couple years ago in a drive-in, and I didn't want to comment on it at the time because I felt that the film was so dark and the soundtrack was so low that it was hard to appreciate it at all in a drive-in venue. Since then I've been impressed with 'The Prestige' and I also thought 'The Dark Knight' was very good, but revisiting this first entry in the new Batman series was largely a waste of time.The movie takes far too long to get going, considering we all know where it's headed. I just don't like the whole idea of this movie, to try to make the origins of someone like Batman clear and rational. Part of his appeal should be the mystery, I think they could have just pretty much started right off with 'Dark Knight.' Look at how much more interesting Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were in the sequel; in this first movie they basically have nothing to do. Rutger Hauer shows up for a few minutes which is nice, but the plot line he's in doesn't really go anywhere interesting. Katie Holmes is very inadequate, and I don't particularly like Christian Bale's version of the Batman character. He mumbles too much when he's in the costume, and the digital manipulation of his voice is obvious and distracting. His Bruce Wayne is almost identical to his Batman, so it takes away from the interesting 'dual identity' angle of the character.However, like in the superior sequel, this film is greatly enhanced by a great villain, this time Cillian Murphy as 'Scarecrow', a man who uses weaponized hallucinogens to strike panic in his victims. Murphy's calm and effeminate screen presence makes him a very chilling villain; he reminds me of Crispin Glover (who was rumored for a while to be in the running for the Joker role that Ledger ended up playing).In the end I feel underwhelmed by the film on DVD just as I was in the theater. Too much of it is strictly standard melodrama structure and characters, not many of the interesting ideas that you see in most of Nolan's other films. It seems conventional almost in a spiteful way, as if Nolan was saying 'hey, I can do *normal* too.' But why? I guess he had to get this film out of his system before he could apply his talents more loosely and effectively to the sequel.",5,1,3,10 August 2008
Liar Liar," Fun for Carrey fans
","This is a Jim Carrey vehicle and it's hard to see it amounting to much more than that. But taken in that context it's an entertaining movie, certainly more fun to me than most of his attempts at drama. In this one Carrey plays a man who, as a result of a birthday wish from his lonely son whose party he's missed, finds himself unable to lie for one day. That sounds simple of course but there are many comic complications stemming from the fact that his character is a lawyer with rather low ethical standards who must present an important argument in court. The meat of the story concerns his relationship with the young son, after his absentee behavior is thrown into relief by the mother's plan to move to Boston and marry a straight-laced man (Cary Elwes).It's worth noting that the film is well enough written to avoid some of the genre clichés in such a way as to actually make the film more interesting. For example in a lot of these types of 'divorce dramedy' movies the new fiancé would be depicted in a really ridiculous way, a total obnoxious jerk or loser. In this film he's more of a nobody than a loser, and they carefully avoided making Elwes' character a jerk because in actuality it's Carrey's who is the jerk, at least at first. The fact that the guy is not a bad dude makes it even more hilarious when, for example, he and the son go off to play ball with the glove Carrey bought for the kid. Carrey's got no good reason to hate him or be mad, but he is anyway. And we totally understand! Some of the courtroom scenes are laugh out loud funny, and I also really enjoyed the scene where Carrey's character presents the case he's been preparing and turns on both his boss and his client (Jennifer Tilly). The child actor, Justin Cooper, was refreshingly free of the kind of manufactured 'spunk' that seems to infest most child performances in comedies. Basically the movie should be commended for avoiding some of the stale aspects of the family film, but at the same time I didn't feel that it really transcended the genre either nor did it provide any really memorable characters that would have enhanced the human element of the story. It's an excuse for Carrey to once again make us laugh with his rubber face, and he does do that well.",6,1,3,5 October 2007
The Princess Bride," Wondrous fantasy that refuses to take itself seriously
","A gloriously witty fantasy film with its heart and soul in the right place -- on its sleeve.  All the performances are good (although Chrystal is too showy for my taste) but Patinkin's is exceptional.  Also features an endearing performance by wrestling star Andre 'The Giant'.  Special note should go to writer William Goldman, who does an almost perfect adaption of his wonderful novel.  Reiner acquits himself well, particularly through the wit and style of the performances (some of them from actors who have not done work so good in the rest of their careers), but relies on close-ups a bit too much.  Reiner should be credited, though, with letting the material speak for itself for the most part, providing fairly straightforward camera movement and positioning.  Best scene for me -- Elwes and Patinkin's classic duel atop the cliffs of death (or whatever they're called).",10,2,3,15 February 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," Awesome film
","David Lean created a film that has already stood the so-called test of time  in fact moreso, it has itself become the test and the measure against which all other war melodrama is compared. It has more to tell us about the struggle between the West and the Middle-East than any contemporary film I've seen. Here we have a strong contrast between the cynical career soldiers and diplomats (most memorably, Claude Rains in one of his last good roles) and an idealistic young man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who wants to 'help' the Arab people establish their own state. But even with all his hope and his good intentions, Lawrence ends up destroying himself and perhaps leaving the Middle-East in a worse position than he found it. Lessons are to be learned from this film that still haven't been learned by all that many, despite its status as a revered 'classic.' There's simply too many strong elements in this film to talk about within the space allowed here  there are so many ideas floating around and so much beauty to behold on screen that every time I see it, it's like I'm seeing a slightly different movie that speaks to me about different things and inspires wonder in me that I've never felt before. With that in mind I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to stop reading, and also to try to see it in a theater if possible. Just to overview. Maurice Jarre's score is perfect; the instant you hear it you will always remember the images and characters of this movie. Freddie Young's photography has never been surpassed in terms of desert cinematography, and Lean manages not only to elicit deft performances from these actors but also to somehow keep the visual momentum flowing so that we're impressed with the monotonous nature and the isolation of the desert and yet never allowing the film's look to become totally static. For example when we see Lawrence sitting on the hill trying to decide if he should go South with Feisal (Alec Guinness) or lead some men West with Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) we get a kind of night-time blueish color and a kind of slow breeze moving the sand in ripples that makes the scene totally unlike anything in the rest of the film. When Lawrence, Sheriff and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) reach Acuba, there's a stunning shot that pans all the way from the desert through the city and to the ocean, at the same time breathtaking its scope and beauty and strangely depressing and isolating because it communicates the idea that the ocean is just a desert made of water, and we humans are the unfortunate ones who must make a living in the tiny spaces between.The performances are astounding, all around. Guinness is capable of doing more than he's required to here in this film, but he has the proper majesterial presence and his face is like a riddle. Quinn is all fire and passion, perhaps representing the most limited version of Arab identity in the film but doing so with so much force that his character is unforgettable. But the first time I saw this movie as an adult, I was most impressed with the performances of O'Toole and Sharif and the way those characters were developed in tandem  Lawrence begins with noble intentions and ends up caught up in destructive and violent ego-fantasies, while Sharif begins as perhaps a petty and jealous man, shooting another Arab who dares to drink from his well, and becomes a politician with an appropriate amount of self-loathing and cynicism but who cares about the future of his people and believes in such a future more than Lawrence. The look on Sharif's face as O'Toole contemplates the fleeing Turkish army between his host and Damascus is one of the most haunting moments I've seen in any movie.I just can't say enough about how impressive this film is and how moved I am after watching it. It's really one of the most powerful films I've seen, worthy of comparison to other great epics like Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' and Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon.' And perhaps more than any other acclaimed war epic, this film succeeds as a character drama and really illuminates the character of Lawrence and his relationship to the war and to the people around him. I keep thinking of that scene where Lawrence has to shoot the man he rescued from the desert  great direction, perfect use of the 'reveal' with the way he builds up the tension in the scene and then shows that it's the same man from the desert, multiplying the tension of the scene a hundredfold. Lawrence asks him if he did it, and seems to take solace in the fact that the killing is justified in some sense because of the man's guilt, but later confesses to great guilt because he felt pleasure in the violence. This scene prepares us for the crucial scene on the road to Damascus, and that look on Sharif's face represents the bitter recognition of what Lawrence has become. As long as this film is, there's not a wasted image or line of dialog. There's no feeling of self-indulgence on the part of the director or the writers; absolutely everything adds to the complex drama and helps us understand Lawrence and how he relates to the world around him. Perhaps people watch this movie and think it's a flawed film because Lawrence is a flawed hero  I think quite the opposite, that it's a great film because Lawrence is a flawed human being and not a hero at all.",10,1,3,13 December 2007
Django Unchained," Tarantino's Redemption
","Quentin Tarantino has delivered an uneven product over the years, if you ask me, but his high points have so far always been worth sticking around for. This film is one of them. Regardless of plot conveniences that are piled on at an almost comical pace, the story and the action are compelling, and the excess of dialog only weighs the film down a little bit. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz are perfect in their roles, bringing that old movie magic where you really root for the good guys. The film isn't any less exploitative than 'Inglorious Basterds'.... where he was treading on 'Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS' territory, now he's in the terrain of Russ Meyer's 'Blacksnake.' Why does it bother me less? I'm not sure, but I've always been more partial to Westerns than War movies, and I thought the characters in this film were a lot more compelling.Morricone's music is better used here than it has been in his other films (it feels like like fanfilm and more like appropriate film music) -- helps that Morricone did an original song for this one (Tarantino obviously reads my posts here, since I mentioned he should just hire the maestro way back in the 90s). Sequel, please! It would be fun to see how Django deals with the civil war in America.",8,0,1,17 February 2015
Ghost Rider," good campy film
","Nobody will be saying that 'Ghost Rider' is the best cinematic achievement of 2007 in future years. But I will personally say it was one of the more enjoyable films to see at a drive-in, and it does hold up pretty well with a few drinks and a DVD as well. Cage is in full-on Elvis mode in this film; he even resurrects the famous finger point from 'Wild at Heart' for this film. It's great to see Cage in a fun movie again, and he seems to be having fun in it  his performance as stunt-rider Johnny Blaze, who made a crooked deal with the devil to save his father from cancer and is now forced to become the devil's bounty-hunter, has just the right amount of dignity and humor. The way the film is set up basically makes it a 'white trash' superhero movie. Cage is paired with Eva Mendez, who plays his high-school sweetheart who he had to leave because of his deal with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda). Yes, the devil truly is a main character in this film, and his son (Wes Bentley) gets in on the action too; after his escape Blaze is sent to hunt him down and bring him to the devil's own justice.The Rider's coolest trick is when he looks into the eyes of a criminal and cause the evildoer to feel all the pain of his victims. Oh yeah, and let's not forget the fact that his head turns into a burning skull. He's also got a really cool bike, I guess. I don't really know because I'm not a big car/bike person. But what I did enjoy was the carnival setting for the early scenes and the way that theme carried over to the modern sequences  Johnny Blaze is definitely a show-off, but in a fun way. I liked the silly scene where he stops traffic to declare his love for Mendez' character.I guess what really sells the film for me is Fonda as the devil and Sam Elliott as his nemesis representing the forces of good. This is smart B-movie-making, giving the audience 2 polar opposite authority figures and casting them with dynamic iconic actors who can hold the kind of weight on screen that such a role demands. This is reminiscent of George Lucas' casting for Star Wars, with iconic actors Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness holding down these types of authority roles in his film, and a lot of films followed this lead with varying degrees of success. Here it is particularly pleasing because of the iconic associations between Fonda and the 'bad boy' biker scene of the 1960s through his association with 'Easy Rider' and Elliott's association with Western films which is another element of this film's fantasy. The secondary villains played by Bentley and others were far less effective and made me feel a bit like I was watching some kind of television fantasy like 'Charmed.' The scene where they went into a honky-tonk reminded me very much of 'Terminator 2' except for the fact that Bentley doesn't have the kind of screen presence to make the scene memorable. This is the only aspect of the film that just didn't work for me.Since I have some space I will respond to some of the comments on this board -- it seems like some people are trying to analyze it far too much and make sense of things that in my opinion are just humorous and silly and therefore enjoyable. One person even complained that it wasn't a superior film in the mold of 'Pan's Labrynth.' It is pretty amazing to think that this movie cost over $100 million, and this type of extreme action/fantasy story would have been done on a much lower budget and received much less scrutiny in the pre-Star Wars age. So many 'blockbusters' take themselves too seriously. I saw this the same night at the same drive-in where I saw 'Spider-Man 3' and this film was very fresh, fun, and suitably light compared to that film. It takes itself just seriously enough that kids will enjoy the action and scares while adults will easily see the intentional humor. I can understand if someone didn't like the movie because it's not the type of thing that everyone enjoys and, as I said, in another age these kind of movies didn't get the kind of criticism they get now because they didn't have the same stars as 'serious' movies and they didn't have the huge budget and exposure that they do now. Nobody slammed 'Planet of the Vampires' because they saw the star of the movie in some kind of serious drama one time and felt that he was 'slumming.' But we don't have 'B movie stars' anymore, and I respect an actor like Cage who obviously knows his craft and applies his skills in a way that's appropriate to the subject matter and style of any film he's involved in. I'm fine with movies about dudes with names like 'Spider-Man' and 'Bat-Man' that want to make some kind of point about the fleeting nature of fame, personal responsibility, right and wrong, etc. Whatever. But it's pretty ridiculous that so many people nowadays actually EXPECT a fantasy movie to be some kind of treatise on morality or some kind of dramatic character story. Maybe it's because movies like 'LOTR' actually pulled it off, but I don't go into every fantasy movie expecting an epic discourse on the nature of good and evil. This is just a film about a biker dude with a flaming skull and a magic bike. If you go into this film just expecting a campy thrill-ride I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's a feast for the eyes and it has a charming way of approaching the more ridiculous aspects of the story.",7,4,6,9 October 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Unexceptional, but distracting
","Saw this movie at the drive ins..... it was a good distracting couple of hours, but really nothing too memorable.Stewart seems to be overshadowed by McKellan, who's having a great time hamming up his character. I thought they dealt with his demise too easily in the final battle, and that in general the ending feels anti-climactic. I didn't feel that it was real for some reason when they were moving the Golden Gate Bridge.... it was just a little too elaborate an effect to feel real. A lot of the dimensions that were in the characters in the earlier film (I didn't see X2) are missing as well.Kelsey Grammar acquits himself well as the blue beast. Not sure how this one works for fans of the comics or the series, but I thought it fell far short of the first film.",5,0,1,29 June 2006
Hellboy," another interesting failure
","I saw this movie because I always sort of intended to see it, and I wanted to watch it while I still had a chance to see 'Hellboy 2' in the theater if I enjoyed it. At this point I'm doubting whether the sequel would be worth it, and really wondering why they bothered to make it at all since this first film didn't really set the world on fire. Seems like 'Pan's Labrynth' was a big enough hit I guess the director can do whatever he wants to now. But that was a far better movie than 'Hellboy.' The only thing that I really enjoyed in 'Hellboy' was the way that Ron Perlman played the character. I like his attitude and his style.The movie itself is pretty bad. The villains are so generic and so poorly performed by Biddy Hodson and Karel Roden that I felt they belonged in a direct to video movie. The monster they have summoned or whatever is just a sort of typical CGI thing with a lot of tentacles. Hellboy fights this monster once and it's pretty interesting, but he just kept fighting that same monster through the entire film which got pretty boring, and even the big final creature looked like just a larger version of the same thing. The story is extremely predictable and nothing interesting ever happens between Hellboy and the federal agent (Rupert Evans). I didn't feel compelled by the romantic angle either, it was like watching a high school soap opera.Some good action scenes and a nice performance by Perlman but otherwise a waste of time.",3,1,3,10 August 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," One of the best fantasy films of all time
","Jackson and his team have managed to actually top their first feature (at least in its theatrical version) with this amazing, over the top, deep-running fantasy epic.  The performances are on, with Rhys-Davies and Bloom's comradery adding an element that was somewhat missing from the first film.  The action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning.  But the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the CGI creation to top all others:  Gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be.  It was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as Gollum's late night conversation with himself (as Smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature.  Never has the suspension of disbelief been so complete in a fantasy movie, and never has a fantasy world been created with such care and attention to detail, as well as to the flow of the story and characters.",10,2,4,3 August 2003
The Incredibles," Yeah....... incredible
","I haven't seen too many of these computer animated films.... but this one really stood out for me. I think the animation is very well done, roughly in the style of 1960s 'speed racer' type films. The characters are very well-rounded, particularly for an animated film. The villain was especially well done, and I liked the way he was introduced in the early part of the film. I kinda hope they find new villains for the 'Incredibles' sequels that are sure to follow.I didn't want to see this film because of all the hype around it, but if you can get past that and just take it for what it is, 'The Incredibles' is a movie that will entertain everyone in the family. A lot of people are going to see this movie and most of them will like it, so you might as well just succumb to the pressure and see the movie!",7,0,1,15 November 2004
Stardust," missing something, but good
","'Stardust' has enough of the elements of a classic faerie story, executed with skill, to please the fan audience. It also has a lot of comedy and some very good FX, so it should have been a bigger hit with general audiences as well. Personally I found it just a pleasing diversion, but somehow missing the qualities that would really make it stand out from the current pack of fantasy epics.Tristan (Charlie Cox) is a young man who swears to bring back a fallen star from the magical land 'over the wall' to prove his love for shallow Victoria (Sienna Miller). He discovers that in the magical world a fallen star would take a feminine form, in this case Yvain (Claire Danes), and eventually (at LONG last) falls for her instead. Along the way they're hindered by the sons of the former King (Peter O'Toole) who need to recover the star to claim the throne and by a trio of evil witches headed by Lamie (Michelle Pfeiffer) who can use the star's heart to reclaim their youth. They're also aided by a pirate (Robert Deniro) with a secret.The best parts of the film for me were the scenes with Deniro and Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer, who I admit I've never particularly liked (or, for that matter, disliked) comes off the best. It's not a difficult part but she balances the comedy demands without making her fearsome personal seem ridiculous, which is an accomplishment. My favorite gimmick in the movie was the way that using magic would gradually age her, which produced some humorous results. Deniro has a short, showy, and comedic part. His role in the film as well as his performance are reminiscent of his part in Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (a far superior film). Most of the really funny scenes in the film come courtesy of Deniro's flamboyant buccaneer.Aside from that, my favorite bit was probably the continued presence of the princes of the realm, who must stick around as ghosts until a new King is chosen. Rupert Everett was particularly great in the role of the most ruthless of the princes.I didn't care particularly for either of the leads. Nothing in particular wrong but they just did not have cinematic presence; they were like TV actors stuck in a movie. Ricky Gervais' bit didn't hold up the weight the director apparently thought it would and his death scene felt jarringly gratuitous. The parts with the hero's mother could have been done better and integrated into the larger story more smoothly.But I think the main thing that kept me from really entering into this fantasy world was just the poor definition of the fantasy world itself. The separation between the 'real' and the 'faerie' world was not maintained in the way that you need to in order to really establish a good fantasy world. The people in 'Wall' are too much aware of the existence of the faerie world, and the people likewise in the faerie world are too aware of those in 'Wall'. That blurs the line between the fantasy and the real and destroys the validity of the story as a faerie tale. I only became conscious of this after watching the film and reflecting on it, but this connects up to some of the things Professor Tolkien said in his brilliant essay 'On Faerie Stories'. The problem isn't the comedy in the fantasy world (Tolkien himself wrote many whimsical fantasies including 'Farmer Giles of Ham' and the original 'Hobbit'), but rather in the lack of definition or absolute separation between the two worlds, which seem to co-exist even in the same physical space much like 'Oz' in the original book by Frank Baum. However at least in 'Oz' Baum makes it very difficult to move between the faerie world and the real world; in this story all it takes is to trick a dude that's standing guard on a wall and you're in the faerie world. This is not to place extrinsic values on the film, but it's a weakness of the fantasy aspects of the film that prevent it from reaching its full potential.People have compared it to Reiner's 'Princess Bride' perhaps because of its combination of heartfelt romance and whimsical ironic humor. I recognize these points of comparison and I do think this was probably a good 'family' film because it could entertain both kids and adults (though personally I thought the violence too heavy for younger kids). I'm tempted to talk about how much better 'Bride' is, but it's a movie that sort of grew on me over the years. I'm one of the people who actually saw 'Princess Bride' in the theater (people forget that it wasn't any more of a box-office hit than 'Stardust' is) and I didn't care for it much at the time. I guess the two share some weaknesses IMHO  occasionally distracting humor, weak leading actors with no presence, and perhaps too much sentiment at times. But over time I was able to look past those things and see 'Bride' as a great fantasy romance, partly because of its self-consciousness. It's hard for me to say whether 'Stardust' will grow in my affections in the same way, but I wouldn't rule it out. I also wouldn't be surprised if audiences discover it on DVD and make it a 'cult hit.' My only real doubt is that in 'Bride' there were at least a few really memorable scenes, especially the duel on the cliffs. There was no real powerful scene like that in 'Stardust', nothing that provided a lot of action while advancing the characters. I didn't think it was a great film, but it surely has something different and special to offer and I feel it deserved better treatment on its first release compared to most of the other stuff I've seen this summer (especially that awful 3rd Pirates film).",6,3,8,11 September 2007
Amadeus," Overrated tripe
","God, why do so many people like this movie?  I mean, I thought it was cool when I was a little kid and I saw it, but other than some cool performances from Hulce and Abraham, what has this movie got to offer?  Excerpts from Mozart's most popular stuff you could buy for $2 on any discount classics CD?  It's got director Forman's usual overuse of head shots and quick reaction shots, his usual reliance on audience reactions to carry the supposed impact of a star's performance (as seen also in his lackluster 90s bioflick, Man on the Moon), plus you've got a whopping case of historical falsification.  The whole thing about Salieri murdering Mozart is ridiculous historical fable that's been passed around by people for years, and has less validity than your average second gunner JFK story.  But viewers of this movie will, unfortunately, probably walk away from it thinking that Salieri was a bad, bad man indeed.  This is unfair to his life and his music, but the producers of this hero-worshipping (though also hero-deflating, in the modern ambigously 'realist' style) flick couldn't care less.  I guess they just didn't see any other possibility for drama in the tale of the spoiled, brilliant musician and instead of concentrating on his professional laxitude and his obsession with sex (which did get an airing), they came up with the whole Salieri murder thing.  Bad idea, bad movie.",3,10,28,8 October 2002
Ghostbusters," Solid comedy hit stands up 2 decades later
","This one sure did provide some relief to me as a kid vacationing in Arizona one hot summer in 1984.  Revisiting it on DVD after probably a decade and a half since the last time I saw it, this film stands up very well.  The performances are right on, starting with Murray as Venkman in surely one of his most substantial and memorable comedic roles.  Akyroid and Ramis are also perfect in their roles (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really appreciate Akyroid's 'comedy').  This is one of the director's best films; the pacing is perfect, with action and comedy in a revolving door... I think this movie was one of the first of its kind and truly trailblazed the way for the big pop comedies of the 1990s and early 21st Century.  The effects aren't even all that bad after all this time, although some of the music is truly lamentable.  A solid, truly funny film that will last at least another 2 decades in its appeal to young and old.",7,0,0,27 February 2004
The Illusionist," Supremely disappointing mystery/melodrama
","The formula: combine the kind of visual feast made possible by modern digital effects and expensive costumes and scenery with some of the better actors of this generation, people like Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton. Throw them into a murder mystery with magic tricks. The result: a less than mediocre film that challenges its audience's patience and intelligence at every turn.Norton plays Eisenheim, a turn of the century magician in Europe who finds his long lost love, Sophie (Jessica Biel) just as she's about to become married to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). They set in motion a complex plot to free her from his clutches, all the time watched by the Prince's loyal police Inspector Uhl (Giamatti).This movie started to alienate me right from the very beginning with the unconvincing and overly showy special effects for the magic tricks. I think it's important to at least make the audience believe that we're watching actual magic tricks that could have been done at the time this movie was set. Instead what we see looks more like a digital version of 'Slimer' from the Ghostbusters. The quality of Eisenheim's magic tricks are approximately matched by the quality of Uhl's 'detecting'. The quality of the mystery itself is so thin that any person with even the most basic skills in detective films could figure it out, but Uhl only figures it out at the very end in a sudden rush of elation. It's one of the movie's weakest points, where everything is revealed in this rush of a montage that basically tells us: 'hey, if you're as smart as Uhl, then you must have been fooled by this movie.' Instead of misdirection, the film simply leaves out elements that would have made the mystery even more obvious.I have very little more to say about it. Never at any point in watching the movie was I more than moderately entertained. I did enjoy Giamatti's performance. I thought Biel's performance was about on the level of the average made for cable movie. Norton's performance was a misfire, far too understated. And poor Rufus Sewell, who is a good actor, was directed in such a way that you'd think he was playing to the back rows. The director of this movie has a pitiful understanding of how to work with the actors he was presented with. It's his good fortune that Giamatti was able to salvage something from it. The production design is pleasant, but sort of monotonous. There should be more of a contrast between the look of the slums and of the palaces, but everything in this film was photographed in a really bland way.'The Illusionist' is the most offensive kind of 'serious' film -- a magic trick that truly is just a trick, with no movie magic.",3,1,6,1 September 2008
Pi," Overrated, silly sci-fi movie
","I still can't believe all the people who tell me they love this movie.  To me, it is the best possible example of style taking over a film, because this is a film with no real substance:  instead of a plot, we are simply supposed to believe that this guy has gone insane because of math (with a bunch of pictures from some book to illustrate the possibility) and that he's being chased by mad yiddish people.  This is so silly I don't even know how to say it.  There are so many fevered dream type sequences that they lose any impact their dynamic visual style gives them by the end of the film.  I was not surprised to see that older voters on IMDB have not rated this film so highly -- they have seen enough movies with quality and substance to know when the director's just putting a mickey over on the audience.  Most older people also appreciate it when a movie actually has a story.  This movie was made to impress a bunch of people who never understood any math in the first place, but would love to believe they did.  For those who have studied esoteric mathematics, this movie is an insult to our intelligence.  A java drama with no heart.",1,90,169,3 November 2002
Children of Men," Very fascinating dystopian film
","I thought this was a really striking movie, very different from any of the (many) futuristic or post-apocalyptic movies that I've seen before and much more visceral than what we usually see in terms of action/sci-fi with big budgets these days. There were some scenes in this movie, like the one where they encountered he burning car/roadblock and the rushing marauders, where I was really overwhelmed by the intensity of the scene, and I was watching it on video on my 32' screen! I can't even imagine really how intense those scenes were in the theater.Cuaron really knows how to direct, he's very inventive and everything he does is just stylish enough that it feels right but not obvious enough to draw attention to itself. I can't say enough about his talent from just the few movies I've seen and particular this one; he's as good as anybody else out there right now and seems to have better taste in material than some. I happen to like directors who only cut the film when they need to. Nobody would call the direction of this movie 'old fashioned', and Cuaron's long takes never linger on landscape portraiture -- he's just as innocent of the abuses of the long take as he is of the abuses of the short take.I really enjoyed the whole design of the movie -- there's a lot of detail that doesn't draw attention to itself, it feels like a real world that people could inhabit as compared to 99% of futuristic scenarios. Even the films that are more of a 'nightmare scenario' than this one don't really convey it with as much complexity or apparent spontaneity. It seems more lived-in than any future world we've seen since 'Blade Runner.' As far as the story and the characters, I found the whole thing very compelling and constantly surprising. Clive Owen was perfect; his obvious personal magnetism is just repressed enough and just generic enough in its quality that he seems like a still-life of a fully developed animal, like a flower that was frozen in half-bloom. I enjoyed all the character performances, especially Michael Caine as Jasper, a truly admirable bohemian cat who unfortunately found himself in the middle of this movie.All 'dystopian' films portray an environmental collapse on some level or the other. This film is different because it portrays it on a more personal level instead of an epic scale. Where the film does approach the epic, especially in the big scenes involving the hotel towards the end, I think it is weakened somewhat. Like the hero, it just barely manages to limp out to the exit with its original ideals more or less intact. Which is saying quite a lot considering how ambitious this film is -- it has such a heavy message but it's not really a sentimental or exploitative treatment.",9,2,7,7 February 2011
Mulholland Drive," One of the most remarkable films in recent years
","A gripping, yet fragmentary, impressionistic story of a girl-girl-guy love triangle, actually centering on the two lovers, Betty and 'Rita' (as in Hayworth's Gilda).  This film is very funny, but I encountered an audience which seemed intent on taking it very 'seriously'.  It's a satire of Hollywood, and Lynch is a director who makes the creation of a film the motivation of the plot itself.  In order for a Lynch film to exist, there must be a 'replacement' leading lady who must be killed (of course).  It is consciously referential to 'Gilda', and seems to reference at least 3 other films:  'Carnival of Souls', 'The Wizard of Oz', and 'Barton Fink.'  I love how Betty looks like Doris Day in Lynchland when she steps off the plane. Although the audience laughed at the old people, they soon went back to sitting on their hands and taking the film as high art, when they really should have just been having a good time and a good laugh.  Consquently, there were many puzzled expressions when exiting the theater.",9,2,4,28 October 2002
Guardians of the Galaxy," Unique spectacle
","I saw this film in 3D at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco.... 3D certainly enhances the visual aspects of the film, which already manage to evoke Star Wars/Star Trek while remaining unique and appealing. There are also a host of solid performances in the film, especially from perennial oddballs and villains like Benicio Del Toro and Michael Rooker. The story is engaging enough, though not particularly original.There are certain aspects of the film that are disconcerting to me.... the main character's chauvinism, to some extent, but mainly the feminized villain and the sadism present in some action scenes. The film follows the trend from bad films like '300' of presenting a villain who is practically a Gothic drag queen. He's neither memorable nor scary. More disturbing still is the sadism in a couple scenes, especially a cantina scene that features a gruesome game involving large aliens devouring smaller aliens (surely the film would have been banned if it had featured a cockfight, but this is the sci-fi equivalent). There's also the scene where somebody tosses the raccoon a gun and the whole movie slows down and pauses to accentuate his 'Oh yeah' before he indiscriminately opens fire on a crowd of prisoners and guards. I've never been big on the gun worship in this culture and I wished it hadn't been transferred to this sci-fi film. One of the cool aspects of 'Star Wars' was the fact that the good guys fought with 'elegant weapons from a more civilized age.' But hell, the movie's fun..... right from the first moments with Chris Pratt's 'Star-Lord' performing a karaoke version of Redbone's classic 'Come and Get Your Love' using a rat as the microphone, you know that this film is going to be goofy and weird. Which makes sense, since it's director, James Gunn, started out in Troma Films. This film does a nice job of balancing the characterization with the sometimes corny jokes, and makes you want to feel positive about everybody. Also, it has a really excellent femme fatale in Karen Gillan. While a lot of the jokes seem pretty obvious, some are more visual and subtle (for example, the little decorative collector's items that Michael Rooker's character installs in his spaceship).All in all, it's a big budget re-imagining of the sort of sexualized and campy vibe that permeated Roger Corman's 'Battle Beyond the Stars' -- some of these films in the Trek and SW franchises really take themselves too seriously, and this film has a lot more freedom and spirit. It's not a great movie by any means, but it stands by itself as a solid achievement while stretching the boundaries of the 'big comic book movie' in a way that, perhaps, George Lucas only dreamed of doing with his 'Howard the Duck' film. Which, fittingly, this film refers to. While the references stretch far beyond expectations ('Footloose', really?) they rarely enter into the domain of the outré. This makes the film an offbeat, but accessible, summer blockbuster that should spawn a series of its own sequels.",7,2,7,20 October 2014
Caddyshack," One of the only early 80s comedies to stand the test of time
","Yes, this one does hold up, perhaps because the action centers on the almost surreal (for a comedy) subject of golf, a topic that had not perhaps been so successfully spoofed since Eddie Cantor starred in 'Kid Boots' (am I getting that one right?).  In the comedy contest between Murray, Chase, and Dangerfield, let me just say that Chase does not win.  Dangerfield is at his best, delivering his classic lines ('this meat's so tough you can see where the jockey was riding it') with ultimate panache and actually playing his crazy character (reminiscent of Peter Sellars in 'The Party') to the hilt.  Murray is really the show-stopper, though, muttering his lines to give them emphasis (?) and racing around the course with what appears to be real mania. 
A lot of the jokes fall flat, but when this movie is on, it's so on, that you can't help but call it a classic.",8,39,64,2 August 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," merely acceptable action film
","Kill Bill is a fun movie to look at but I have to ultimately agree with those who said it lacks whatever I would personally call substance. I haven't seen the second part so perhaps that might mitigate it somewhat but still I think this film was disappointing on a lot of levels.The story is a pretty basic revenge story  a bride (Uma Thurman) is shot and left for dead on her wedding day and she seeks revenge on criminal mastermind 'Bill' (David Carradine, whose face is never seen)and his cohorts for the crime. The story is told in Tarantino's usual back-and-forth style, for no apparent reason in this case (just as the film switches from color to black and white in the finale and back again for no apparent reason. Maybe QT thought that would keep the scene from growing stale, but it does so regardless). The bulk of the story of this first installment deals with her chase after the unlikely Japanese mafia lord (lady?) O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). This character is so unlikely that we are treated to something like 20 minutes of footage to explain her origins. The animation is interesting but the scene where she slaughters a rival yakuza when he complains about her being part-Chinese feels forced would that scene even be in the movie if Liu had not been cast in the part? Probably the film's strongest area, as mentioned above, is the visuals. This film has the density of a graphic novel. Unfortunately even this aspect becomes forced, as for example in the finale when we have that 5 minutes or so of black and white footage, and then we have the Liu character fleeing into a frosty landscape garden, seemingly for no other reason than to provide a new and different setting for the climactic battle. At the very least though it's interesting to note that few action films conclude with a battle between two female warriors.Another part of the film that feels dull is what seems like an entire reel devoted to the making of a sword, a part of the film that feels inserted to give the film a sense of spirituality. Much of this sequence is subtitled which adds to the sense that we are supposed to feel this is an 'important' part of the film.All my feelings about this film -- its effectiveness but at the same time its lack of originality and purpose -- could be summed up by the way they use Ennio Morricone's music in this film. First we have Daryl Hannah marching down a hospital hallway in a kind of nurse outfit with an eyepatch. She's supposed to be whistling this Morricone type tune, but it just does not look right. The effect is humorous where it's probably supposed to be frightening. Then at the film's climactic battle we're treated to the strains of Morricone's 'Death Rides a Horse.' It's an awesome song, awesome soundtrack.... only problem being it's ALREADY the soundtrack to a revenge film with John Philip Law. So when I first saw the film in the theater, I was distracted by memories of that film.There is a lot here to appreciate, particularly the slick visuals. There's also a fairly effective combination of action and humor. I'm curious to see the second part, but I wasn't curious enough to actually see it in the theater after seeing this one. I'm disappointed overall.... I don't know if I should call myself a 'Tarantino fan' but I have seen all his movies since 'Pulp Fiction' in the theater and I enjoyed them. This one felt a bit flat, particularly because it was a step backward into a less story-oriented, more goofy and showy, style of film-making like what he was doing with 'PF'. All of the violence in 'PF' and 'Reservoir Dogs' however had a feeling of brutality that made it feel real despite the offbeat humor in the films. But in 'Kill Bill' we reach the point of excess where the action itself becomes ridiculous and pointless, particularly in the ludicrous finale where this barbie doll type woman kills something like 50 armed men at the same time. A good director like Tarantino should be able to come up with better and more original ideas than he has done here.",5,14,26,23 March 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Equal in quality to the original
","I saw this film at the drive ins, lots of fun, really enjoyed the film. I just saw the original film version a few weeks ago so I'm able to make a pretty close comparison and I think they are both about equal. I can see how someone who enjoyed the first version a whole lot would dislike this one because it is very different, but as someone who's always enjoyed it but never considered it one of my favorite films, I really liked seeing a new director and actors take a crack at this one. I like the results, definitely plan on seeing it again.The production design is of course one of the most impressive parts of the film. Depp's acting is wonderful, the only aspect that bothered me was he borrowed some of his mannerisms from his Hunter Thompson impersonation in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', like when he ate the candy and smacked his tongue around just like in that movie with the 'adrenochrome'. I really liked Depp though throughout, and I liked his interaction with Chris Lee, one of my favorite actors.The only part I didn't really like as much as the first film was the oompah loompah songs. They were interesting, but not very original. One of them was really blatantly similar to the music of 'Queen'. Another one was very 'Bollywood'. Maybe they'll grow on me over time, but at this point I don't like them as much as just the simple song in the first version.All in all, a worthy re-imagining of the children's classic. Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' was a disaster, but this one is good. Not as good as 'Big Fish', but it's good.",7,3,4,28 July 2005
Big Fish," Exquisite; Burton's best film
","'Big Fish' is one of the most thrilling, amusing and emotionally compelling films I've seen this past decade. It's also, in my opinion, accomplished director Tim Burton's best film so far. The film struggles to illuminate one of the most significant questions of philosophy: 'What is the measure of a man?' In doing so it never becomes pedantic, an impressive feat considering the titular 'Big Fish in a small pond'  Ed Bloom (played alternately at different life stages by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney)  is as self-absorbed as they come. At times his over-sized ego is the source of his charm  as when he convinces friendly Giant Karl (Matthew McGrory) to leave his small Alabama town by offering to leave with him: 'you think this town is too small for you? Well it's too small for me too!'. At other times it becomes oppressive, a source of deep division between the father and his son Will (Billy Crudup)  as when he spends much of his son's wedding telling tales of his OWN adventures or when he angrily tells his son that it's his own fault if he can't understand his father. Part of the film's genius is in the fact that it's able to draw us into Ed Bloom's tall tales and fill us with wonder and joy at the man's sheer joy-of-living, while at the same time gradually bringing our sympathies more in line with son Will's. And all of this before it takes both the audience AND Will through a series of experiences that synthesize the two. After all is said and done, after all, sometimes the greatest truth lies in fiction.For the most part, each actor in this film provides a memorable characterization. With its narrative constantly in flux between mythical past and dreary present (Ed Bloom is in the process of dying while son Will tries to discover the truth about his father's life), casting of the lead roles could easily have killed the film, but happily there is sufficient synergy between the 2 story structures to make us believe these are the same people and at the same time make the distinction between 'real' and 'fantasy' more than simply a matter of nifty special effects. For example, the resemblance between Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) and her younger self (Alison Lohman) is so great that when I first saw the film I thought it was the same actress using makeup effects. But the directing and acting are of such discriminating skill that we can easily see the difference between the 'girl of his dreams' and the woman who made the hard choices necessary to actually live with this man. Lange absolutely nails the profound mixture of sadness from losing a loved one while at the same time giving thanks for all the joy that their life together has brought them. As with all things in this film, the difference between the dream girl and the 'real' woman ultimately don't matter at all.I can't let these comments go without at least briefly mentioning some other exceptional aspects of the production. Danny Elfman's music usually rises (i.e. 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure') or sinks (i.e. 'Planet of the Apes') to the level of Burton's work, and happily this film is no exception. Philippe Rousselot has provided us with haunting images that will never fade from memory, and is equally adept at Ed's fantastic and colorful mythology and his drab later life. Danny Devito is perfect as a shady showman with a dark secret, and Deep Roy is memorable as well as his best friend. Finney and McGregor are both an absolute joy to watch  no more to say about that, just watch them. On first viewing I thought Crudup was relatively weak, but the more I see it the more fitting his performance seems. Yes, he does seem to underplay most of his scenes and lacks a certain presence on screen. But it's perfect  if he were being portrayed by an actor like Hugh Jackman or Tom Cruise it would make it hard to see the profoundly different personalities of the extravagant father and his down-to-earth son.Well, that's it  I'd be lying if I said that everything in the movie makes perfect sense to me, but it just feels right. It works. Like Ed Bloom's stories, it has justified its own existence (and how many big budget films even come close?) simply by telling its story.",10,1,2,11 June 2007
Quiz Show," Solid character based drama focuses on ethical problems
","I found this film very interesting -- it concerns the collapse of the game show bubble in the 1950s, when a famous professor's son became a quiz show champion only to be disgraced when it was made public that he had been given answers in advance.None of the characters did anything really all that wrong in terms of morality.... they lied, they cheated, but nobody was killed, and arguably other than fooling some people no one was really hurt. So this film really is an examination of ethics, of the ultimate importance (or lack thereof) of truth and integrity in the academic and governmental worlds.The 3 actors playing the principle roles are impeccable. John Turturro, always a convincing and riveting character actor, puts in one of his better and more substantial performances as the original quiz show champ, Herbie Stemple, who is deposed by the academic hot-shot Van Doren. Van Doren is essayed by Ralph Fiennes, who really steals the film in a lot of ways with his performance. He's tragic, you want to like him, but at the same time you know that his honesty and his integriy only go so far. He too has been corrupted by the money, and by the urge to distinguish himself from his father's fame and stand on his own. So ultimately you do feel sorry for him. Rob Morrow does a fine job as the government's man, Goodwin, who exposes the scam. He brings to the fore the real ethical problem that the film wants to expose -- the fact that the machinations of Congress and the anger of the American people were focused on Van Doren and the other quiz show cheaters, and not on the studio network heads and the corporate sponsors (a memorably low-key performance by director Martin Scorsese) who are just as responsible for the deception.One weakness -- I thought the character of Sandra Goodwin, played by Mira Sorvino, was either under-written or edited out of the film too heavily. At one point she and her husband have a really grisly argument about why he is not going to call Van Doren to the stand, and it really feels like her criticism (the intensity of it especially) is coming out of nowhere. I suspect a scene may have been deleted, or I would have to blame poor writing, but it really felt disjointed to me and my girlfriend commented to me about the same thing.All around a solid effort, one of Redford's best films.",7,0,0,26 December 2006
The Dark Knight," Excellent superhero movie
","Batman (Christian Bale) hits the streets again with his most famous foe, the Joker (Heath Ledger) as his foe. Where the first film in Nolan's new series expressed basically the problems with Batman's double life, this new film focuses (to whatever it extent the film can be said to have focus) on the effect that he has on the criminals themselves and the culture of 'Gotham City.' The most successful and surprising aspect of the film is the way that it truly makes the audience believe by the end that anything could happen (i.e. one of Gordon's kids could really die), as opposed to most superhero movies where the outcome eventually becomes obvious if not tedious. Ledger's performance is also a huge factor in the film's quality. He's really scary, not over the top at all in a bad way.My problems with the film remain some of the same problems from 'Batman Begins.' I think Bale is sort of a dull Batman, primarily because he's not really convincing as Bruce Wayne. Specifically his version of Bruce Wayne is so cool and composed that it would seem obvious to everyone that he's Batman, whereas Michael Keaton for example seemed like such a doofus at times in the Bruce Wayne persona that you could believe that people would assume he was too much of a dilettante even if they did suspect him a bit. Believability is strained, even within the context of a superhero film, when Wayne slips away from his party and then moments later replaced by Batman, and yet nobody suspects.One thing I also liked about the Burton films was that Nicholson's Joker was both funny and terrifying, whereas I noticed all the jokes that Nolan tried to pull with Ledger's Joker came off flat. The dark atmosphere of the film is so unrelenting that the audience does not really feel inclined to laugh, and that produces an effect that dulls the overall edge of the action scenes. I tend to prefer superhero films that take themselves less seriously, yet this one was so well done in its own style that I would actually rate it higher than 'Iron Man' for example despite the fact that the latter was actually more my type of movie. You just can't ask me to take crimefighters in capes and armored suits seriously for 2 plus hours, but this movie actually came amazingly close.Halfway through the movie I was thinking that it really wasn't any better than 'Batman Begins' which I thought was somewhat mediocre, but then Ledger's performance really hits the high gear. I loved the dialog scene between Joker and Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) in the hospital and the bit with him walking out. Also Batman and Joker in the interrogation room was a very strong scene. The really scary possibility that Ledger's performance raises is the possibility, perhaps only glimpsed, that the Joker might actually be more sane than Batman or even more sane than the average 'civilized' person. 'I'm just ahead of the curve' he says, and we almost want to believe him. These 'supervillains' spring from essentially the fertile ground of Lon Chaney's performances in films such as 'The Penalty' in 1919, where he was a legless criminal mastermind who wanted revenge on the entire city of San Francisco -- yet Ledger takes it to still another level by doing an irrational, anarchic take on the idea. He actually recites various versions of his invented 'backstory' to his victims as if to mock their desire to contextualize his behavior through some rational explanation i.e. 'my father beat me', 'my mother didn't love me.' The concept of revenge or even psychological compensation is just another joke to him. If indeed he is 'insane', his ego will not allow him such a luxury and his very purpose seems to be to deny us the consolation of a rational or formulaic explanation for his brutality.I wasn't disappointed with the film at all -- this is basically as good as this type of thing gets. It wasn't a truly great film like Nolan's 'The Prestige', but I didn't really expect it to be. I did notice some of Nolan's trademarks like the repetition of certain sounds and images in different contexts. I'm very excited by the possibilities for Nolan's next couple movies because this one is such a big hit that he basically has a blank check.",7,7,15,24 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," good entry in the series
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  the name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but it's one of the more entertaining films I've seen so far this summer. Since I've read the book, it's a little hard for me to judge how good this movie would be for me if I had not read it. But all in all I found it more entertaining and convincing than the 4th film, not quite as good as the 3rd. It really seems like the more the filmmakers try to avoid slavish devotion to the books the better they are as films.In this installment of the series, we see the menace of Lord Voldemort growing while the 'Ministry' sticks its head in the sand and denies that what Harry Potter saw at the end of the 4th film actually happened. This leads to various humorous and dramatic situations, although the story somewhat lacks focus. Unlike in all of the previous HP stories, in this book we are not primarily concerned with the discovery of a treacherous tutor or former student, so the mystery component present in previous Rowling stories is missing. In its place we have the development of a more complicated character for Potter and we see the Ministry itself emerging as a confounding villainous influence, particularly when they recruit Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new headmaster of Hogwarts. She introduces a regime that is low on educational content and high on pink accoutrements adorned with kittens.Umbridge's slow descent into outright fascism is certainly the story's most compelling element, and Staunton's performance is just as excellent and brilliant as Rowling's description in the novel. I could see the audience around me go from being sort of annoyed and amused by her, to being deeply annoyed at her, and finally as her tortures grow more intense the audience reaction descended to hisses and other vocal forms of anger. Very effectively done. I'm glad the writers left former-educator Rowling's commentary on education in the story  it's a rare thing indeed for a popular fantasy story to convey to the audience at least some hint of the difference between pointless theoretical memory-based learning and a more practical application-based learning style.Daniel Radcliffe's performances as Potter are becoming more and more interesting and capable. Wish I could say the same for the other two actors in our primary triumvirate, although the addition of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was solid casting. Unfortunately a lot of the parts of the story involving Ron and Hermione were excised on the way from book to screen and the actors seem to feel the need to over-act as if to compensate for their lack of screen time. I also think downplaying Harry's argumentative and jealous relationship with Ron with regards to his Quiddich playing damages several other scenes in the film, particularly when he tells Sirius (Gary Oldman) that he's afraid he's becoming a bad person (which we've seen very little evidence of in the film). We see virtually nothing of some of the better character actors in the series including Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). But on the plus side, what we do see is good, and we now get to see much more of Ralph Fiennes fun Voldemort portrayal.When all is said and done, it's a fine film for Potter fans.",7,1,5,18 July 2007
Singin' in the Rain," A delight for film fans
","Story of a silent film hearthrob's uneasy transition into stardom in the 'talkie' era is spiced with the cream of N.H. Brown's MGM library crop.  The dance sequences are superb, featuring Charisse as the 'dream girl'.  But what really makes the film is the real chemistry and well-developed (within the limited time available) love story.  Comden and Green have provided a very nice script, and the photography and directing are excellent. 
The song 'Make 'em Laugh' is a blatant rip-off of Cole Porter's 'Be A Clown' (written for the Freed unit only a few years before), and all the other music is from the 30s, so this lack of originality is the film's only real fault.",10,1,6,4 November 2002
Alice in Wonderland," Boring
","Just saw this one finally, wasn't too impressed. Of course everybody here on IMDb except Burton fans said it was terrible, and the Burton fans said 'best movie yet.' Of course. So I can't really go off that. I just have to eventually see the movie because I have some faith in Burton. I thought he was really going downhill in the late 90s when he did 'Sleepy Hollow' and the horrendous 'Planet of the Apes', so I didn't see 'Big Fish' until years later. Then when I saw it, I realized how stupid I was to give up on Burton because all in all it's a wonderful movie, just as good as his early films. So then my faith in him is totally restored, I'm beating myself up for having so little patience to give up on a director I know is kind of special just because he did one mediocre movie and one horrible movie, so I start seeing his movies again. And since then, only 'Sweeney Todd' was really worth seeing, and that was just barely worth seeing.So I'm thinking about giving up on him again.Oh, not a horrible movie like 'Planet of the Apes' -- that would almost give me hope that there could be another breakthrough on the horizon. If anything, Burton must have realized that he screwed up with that movie and he went and did a more interesting project. But if he keeps making really average movies like 'Alice' and 'Wonka' and the audience keeps going, then he's got no incentive to improve.The movie is just sort of there in front of you. There are too many precious scenes, too much intricate scenery that doesn't add up to a pleasing whole. You sit there looking at the details like the little nuances of Johnny Depp's weird costume and you end up not seeing half the movie. Tim Burton's action scenes have never seemed all that great to me. And that poor actress, he really leaned on her a lot and didn't protect her. It would have been a miracle if she had actually pulled it off. Crispin Glover, I thought at least he would be really good or really bad, but I'm indifferent to his performance here. It's not funny and it's not scary but it's not annoying. Depp has a few nice moments. At least his character here is more likable than in the Wonka movie. Although at some point I'd like to see Depp play a character for Burton who's not an eccentric. Make a movie where all the characters are weird but Johnny Depp is normal. Now that would be something different for Burton. This is just more of the same. He got the best performance out of his wife Bonham-Carter, although there were so many effects that it's difficult to say what's really her.There is no summing it up. The movie ends (SPOILERS) with a big, not particularly interesting, battle. And then Johnny Depp does an awful dance to the worst song Danny Elfman has written since he was in Oingo Boingo. There were a lot of things in the movie like that which were obviously supposed to be funny but my gal and I were at best amused, not ever laughing. I think I chuckled one time at the Red Queen slapping Crispin Glover around, but that's pretty pathetic laugh-o-meter for a movie that was at least supposed to be 30% comedy. I kept thinking how Terry Gilliam made a funnier movie with a scarier Jabberwocky for like fifty bucks back in the 70s. Everything in this movie is basically you're looking at things happening, you never really feel caught up in it or like there's any real danger. The movie finally ends with a bunch of obligatory women's-lib-in-19th Century nonsense to wrap up the framing device which apparently we're also supposed to care about, and then probably the worst pop song I've heard in a decade comes on the soundtrack. 'You can't make me stop' she's singing, or something like that. Oh it's as easy at home as pressing a button, but I guess in the theater these function to empty the room so the ushers can sweep up the popcorn and get ready for another bunch of suckers.",4,1,3,18 October 2010
Avatar," Nice effects create mesmerizing world
","James Cameron is an interesting director, increasingly M.I.A. but seemingly invulnerable to the risk of the huge productions he tackles on the rare occasions when he does return to work. Back in the days of 'True Lies' and 'Titanic', everybody expected his next 'most expensive movie ever' to be the Heaven's Gate of FX film. But by now most of us have given up that expectation as it seems he has an incredible knack for picking the kind of stories that work well with FX and tie together action and sentiment. Really the only time he's failed was with 'The Abyss,' a movie that you had to admire but which was hard to enjoy. I kind of expected 'Avatar' to be a more elaborate version of 'Abyss', but it's quite a lot more cohesive (if simple) and compelling than any of his action films in quite a number of years.So let that be the first caveat, and the first qualifier -- this is an action movie. Those who expected it to be high drama and/or to challenge the formulas of film storytelling, will have to look elsewhere (hint: Terry Gilliam has a new one out on DVD this month too). While the film does have an interesting sci-fi premise -- basically it's a reverse of his original 'Terminator' film, in which machines were designed to look like humans to infiltrate their refugee camps, while in this one humans are the baddies and they use 'avatars' in native form to infiltrate alien camps -- it doesn't really go anywhere with it. Basically the story is more of a melodrama than anything else, about an invading human being persuaded to the side of the native Na'vi viewpoint and helping to beat the attacking hordes of humans.It doesn't really matter, because I found myself watching this in 3D in the theater basically not wanting to miss a second of it. It's just all so fascinating to look at, even if you're never entirely 100% inside the world of the movie. Or at least I wasn't. Constantly we're just so awestruck by the fantasy world that we start to think about the effects, which kind of takes you out of the movie, but then you don't want to stop watching to see what will happen next (in the effects, not the story), so it's very engrossing cinema regardless of where the interest is coming from.",8,1,3,10 May 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Exquisite film package with disturbing contents.
","A tyro film for Kubrick and McDowell -- perhaps a career best for both great film artists.  Tale of a dark future where people have largely traded their freedom of thought for security (should hit close to home these days).  Alex is the apotheosis of this:  he is literally turned into a machine through pharmaceutical therapy, forced to 'viddy' scenes of rape, murder, and fascism to condition him against violence.  He also loses the ability to listen to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the 'punishment element' or, the tragic 'weepy part', depending on your viewpoint.  Kubrick's film is deliberately provocative, forcing us to identify with Alex although it unflinchingly shows his hideous acts and his stupidity.  Marvelous photography, direction, acting.One thing that strikes me in particular is how well Kubrick and his art men have achieved their goal of making the environments the characters inhabit reveal their emotions or tensions.  Particularly memorable are the wasted theatrical environment that is the stage for the battle with 'Billy Boy' and his droogs and the cramped, 'futuristic' apartment Alex shares with his parents.  It's crammed with smiley faced sunflowers and psychedelic wallpaper, every bit the degraded vision of the flower child generation brought with a push into comfortable middle age.  Doctors and clinics are sterilized white, their plastic gloves and needles marking out their own self-conscious state of superiority and objectivity.  And the final section of the film brings Alex through a succession of locations, ending up depositing him back 'Home' for his suicidal attempted finale.  Place and situation are thus shown to be very important or 'conditioning' of the individual's actions, for although Alex seems to be a 'hero' or 'active' character, he is in fact only clever in that he can master many different situations (the streets, prison, clinics) by adapting himself to his present circumstances and surroundings, whatever they may be.  This places him, in the final situations, as the pawn of situations and people outside his control.Striking, unforgettable, infinitely rewatchable.",10,6,10,8 October 2002
Groundhog Day," Great comedy, one of Murray's best
","I just watched the film again after not having seen it since I saw it in the theater. I enjoyed it much more at the age of 29 than I did at the age of 17! At that younger age, the romance in this movie seemed too cheesy for me to take, but I can now see the movie as a decent romance, but mostly just a great comedy. It's sort of an existential comedy, it really puts its character in the place of having to question the value of his life. Since he can't even make the choice to end his life, in a way he's stuck in 'the Myth of Sysyphus' and can't rise above it until he stops fighting it and lets other people affect him. It reminds me of the more recent film 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' in this way.Murray's character is excellently realized... the other characters are good but they come off more as sounding boards for his character, including McDowell. I enjoyed the way the film was paced, it seemed to know perfectly how and what to show the audience. Don't know what else to say about it, it's a solid film, probably Murray's best straight-up comedy.",8,1,3,25 February 2005
National Treasure," mediocre adventure film
","'National Treasure' is not a movie I have a lot to say about so I'll try and keep my comments brief. It's a decent family film I assume, but not that much fun for me. I love the old-school adventure movies and even a lot of the nostalgic films that 'throwback' to this time, i.e. 'Indiana Jones' and 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'. 'National Treasure' on the other hand is a modern-day story and not a period story, but the style is somewhat similar in its lack of pretense and focus on adventure styled action that's less violent than what we see in most 'action movies' these days.I was amused to read through some of the comments and see that a lot of people hated the film because it was 'stupid' or variations on that theme. Probably they don't realize that pretty much everyone over the age of 12 who actually enjoyed the film knew that it was a stupid movie but were mature enough to enjoy it anyway. Nobody should expect a history lesson from the film, although it is somewhat amusing to draw such an adventure out of America's founding fathers' Masonic legacy. In the end though the film's reverence for Ben Franklin et al felt a bit too heavy-handed, as if they were some kind of wizards of antiquity.So I was ready to drop all intellectual pretense, but still the movie was only mildly entertaining. The comic relief offered by Justin Bartha was distracting; they should either have labored to make him a good straight sidekick or a goofy humorous one, but instead tried for both and failed at each. I guess he was supposed to be relatively 'normal' and someone who the average 'Gen X' or 'Gen Y' or whatever it's called now could identify with. To me he was just a lame character played by a virtual non-actor. Not much more from leading lady Diane Kruger. Lovely to look at, but she's been given a horrible role here in which her only purpose is to make love to Nicholas Cage and be the butt of bad humiliating jokes. Cage is all right but that's about it, not even as much fun in this one as he was in the much cheesier 'Ghost Rider.' The idea of him being from a family of treasure hunters who are discredited by the academic community is a good one. Casting professional estranged father Jon Voight as his daddy wasn't. Even more embarrassing was Harvey Keitel in a thankless role as a federal agent. I'm sure this film paid for a few interesting independent films for Keitel but that doesn't mean I have to like seeing him in such a dull role far beneath his capabilities.The worst thing about the film for me was the music. It was just the most generic pounding theme, alternating big symphonic bombast with grating electronic drumbeats. This music is a perfect metaphor describing the film itself  loud, empty, not as much fun as it should be.It wasn't a total disaster though, just not something I can really embrace because all the fun parts are diluted by the things that annoyed me. I did think it was an attractive film, and the pace was pretty good. I probably would have enjoyed it slightly more in the theater. Sean Bean was a pretty good villain, more restrained than most movie bad guys. I really enjoy the idea of the treasure, it excites me more as a student of history than for its value in money, so I sympathized with the main character's ethical standard regarding disposing of the treasure. Of course in reality the founding fathers put America deeply in debt with the expense of the Revolutionary War against Imperial England, causing a tax on distillation which in turn led to the famous 'Whiskey Rebellion' in Pennsylvania, and if they had access to any kind of treasure whatsoever they would have used it for the nation's benefit instead of hiding it away where it would do no good to anyone. But whatever.. it's still a fun idea. I just wish they had done more with it.",5,2,4,5 September 2007
Total Recall," One of Schwartzenneger's Best
","When I first saw it in the theater I was 15 years old and I thought it was one of the best movies I ever saw. It was some fun to come back to it 15 years later. At this point I can see that there's a lot of humor in there, whereas as a younger person I took it very seriously. Verhoeven is a very good director, and this is one of his better films -- he is able to give us a film that is complex but at the same time not obtrusively so. You can kind of take and leave what you want from Verhoeven's glossy satire. Schwarzenneger's performance is one of his best, one of the only times he played an actual human being with anything like believability. A lot of times his physical mass prevents him from passing as 'normal', but here his stature just adds to the sense that something is wrong in the first place with him being this peaceful construction worker, and adds some irony to the fact that this man is made so helpless by the mental tinkerers at 'Total Rekall', a place where you can buy the memory of a vacation if you don't have time to take an actual trip.The violence is so extreme that it's at times sickening, but I just find it all humorous because I don't really take the movie all that seriously. A lot of people laugh when they hear that Phil Dick wrote the source story, but this film actually sticks a lot closer to its source material than 'Blade Runner' or 'Minority Report' or any of the other more 'respected' Dick adaptions that I've seen. It's worth pointing out that while the moments of extreme violence in Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' sometimes feel like arbitrary concessions to the action movie audience and don't feel fully integrated into the film's somber tone, Verhoeven's film is consistently giddy, turbulent, and fast, making the violence seem more natural to his film's glossy aesthetic.I think Ron Cox did some good work here but basically Michael Ironside stole the show as far as villains go. He's the definition of a 'loose cannon', so jealous of Quaid's (Schwarzenneger) connection with his gal Lori (Sharon Stone, appropriately feral) that he becomes a figure who's both sympathetic and terrifying. Rachel Ticotin is merely serviceable, rather underwhelming considering she's given a meaty role for the love interest in an action film.Special notice should go to the great Rob Bottin and his company for some of his most impressive animatronic work  which is saying a lot. Maybe the effects are a bit aged now, but they are quality effects, and I predict that they will stand the test of time better than most computer generated effects films. This was one of the last big effects films to use only actual photographic elements for all its shots. It features an impressive matte/miniature shot that takes us from the inside of a train to the Martian landscape and ultimately soaring above Mars' domed cities  a shot that is very close to one that was planned for the beginning of 'Blade Runner' but abandoned for financial reasons.As a Phil Dick adaption, it's an interesting case because even though as stated above the film sticks somewhat closer to Dick's original than most adaptions have done ('Minority Report' deserves particular shame for introducing the exploitative element of the deceased child), it is also the furthest in tone and feeling from Dick's work in some ways. It captures his paranoia about identity and memory control with great accuracy. Simply for communicating such a complex idea  that a person's identity could actually be changed by artificial intelligence technology  to the popcorn-munching millions (like my own former 15-year-old self). And in the end we have a film that is essentially a top-notch action film that's crossed over into 'The Twilight Zone'. Schwartzenneger, whose 2 other best films IMHO were the similarly sci-fi flavored 'Terminator' and 'Predator', must have known this, as he reportedly took a personal interest in the project before production began. He put his heart in the film in a way he never had before and never did again. For his part, Verhoeven returned to a similar turf in 'Starship Troopers', which was also a fun movie but perhaps not quite as much fun as this one or 'Robocop'. So this is also a career peak for him as well.",7,0,3,10 July 2007
Some Like It Hot," Monroe shows off her real comedy talent
","Comedy set in the late 20s/early 30s features stereotypes of the era -- bombshell torch singer (Monroe, of course), hard-as-nails gangster boss (Raft, of course), and go-getter protagonists (Lemmon and Curtis, of course).  Everything is spoofed in a light way.  Very nice photography. Some of the jokes are flat, but the visual humor can't fail -- especially Lemmon in his crossdressing disguise, which he seems to grow more and more into until his final scene where he and Joe E. Brown seem to be 'sailing into the sunset' together.  As Joe says 'nobody's perfect.'  But this movie's close.",9,5,6,4 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," decent first film
","The first film in the epic 'Harry Potter' series, directed by kiddie-movie specialist Chris Columbus, feels a bit slight compared to some of the stories that followed it, but there are many delights here for both Potter fans and fantasy movie fans in general. The fun of the movie always feels a bit contrived and forced, which I think is mostly the fault of the director. But on the other hand a wonderful cast was brought together for this film, a cast which formed the core of the solid ensemble that carried through the rest of the film series (so far). By that I mean not so much the 3 primary child actors, who in this film showed no particular flair or talent (though they look and feel right good casting as opposed to good performing, for the most part) but moreso the supporting cast of mostly British actors.Me, I gotta confess  I love my villains. Give me Vincent Price anyday over Errol Flynn and I'll take Boris Karloff for Clark Gable. So I have to give it up first and foremost to Harry Potter's main man, Severus Snape  a brilliant performance by Alan Rickman that holds the movie together just as much if not more than Richard Harris' dignified take on Albus Dumbledore (which I find superior to the actor in the later films). Snape's character has a lot to do with the success of the film, because he must be oily and underhanded but at the same time complex enough to make the resolution believable. It's a really fun cast all around, with fantasy stalwarts like Warwick Davis peppering a cast of the U.K.'s finest character actors. Maggie Smith's work as Professor McGononagall is particularly spot-on, and the legendary Robbie Coltrane provides humor and personality as the perfect film version of Hagrid.I think the action scenes feel a bit generic perhaps it's part of the downfall of the visual medium as opposed to the literary one, but the magic and so forth just doesn't have the humor and quirkiness of the book. My only other real problem with the film is the soundtrack, which is also very generic. John Williams seems to have been in a certain default mode for the last 20 years and this film was no exception. I'm glad they replaced the score in some of the later films with something more interesting and unique to befit the stories. With Williams' score lurching underneath all the action a lot of this film feels more ordinary than it should.But the story is relatively faithful to the book, which is nice, and this is probably the easiest of all the books to adapt into a film. It's impossible not to feel charmed by the spirit of fantasy as we watch all the 'first-years' clamber onboard the Hogwarts Express to trade tales of Wizarding and Bertie Botts Every-flavor Beans. Unlike some of the later films (particularly 'Goblet of Fire') the movie doesn't just feel like an accessory to the books  although it has a very long running time this film stands alone more than the later stories.A pretty good introduction to the Potter universe, when all is said and done, but not an exceptional fantasy film on its own merits.",6,0,0,26 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Ho-hum Harry returns series to previous tedium
","After a brief respite of cinematic respectability with 'Prisoner of Azkaban', the Harry Potter series is back squarely in the well-traversed realm of pointless over-the-top special effects and achingly obvious character development. The third film in the series had lifted it from the drek, had made something special out of this series. I have to admit I have not read the books, I don't know if the quality of the books follows the quality of the films in any way. But I do think with this story, 'Goblet of Fire' could have been much better, more substantial in some ways. For instance, it doesn't seem to know what to do with Ron and Hermione. They pop up every once in a while mainly as distractions to Harry's quest. There is a too lengthy sequence involving a ball-room dance (yes, there really is) and then we don't see them for what seems like a half hour.Fiennes' sorcerer is a bit under-whelming. I kept waiting for the makeup transformation to finish, couldn't believe that was their final concept. He plays it straight evil, which means there's not much to grab onto here.I heard that the same director is working on the 5th film. That would be a mistake. This film's magic feels decidedly.... unmagical. It feels like one special effects shot after another. They don't even capture the magic as well as Chris Columbus' stale Christmas dinner sequence in the first film, for bog's sake. Every time they went to do one of their challenges, I thought it was a final boss in a video game. Too much frenetic effects, not enough feeling behind it.For all of that, it was watchable, and probably will delight the hardcore Harry Potter fan-base. But for those of us who are dragged to the films by our children or significant others, this film does not offer up the kind of unexpected joys that the third film did. For fans only IMHO.",5,1,5,5 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," OK, but I think for fans only
","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is, unfortunately, not one of the best Harry Potter movies despite (or perhaps because of) sticking relatively closely to J.K. Rowling's original novel (IMHO one of the better in the series). Some parts feel overlong and others too short, and there are signs that director Chris Columbus was growing fatigued in his second (and final) entry in the series.Overall I think we have a good fantasy film here. Other than Rupert Grint's Ron (Grint's whole range of facial expressions seem to consist of scrunching up his face in a Spielbergian 'ewwwww' pose) the young actors were growing well into their roles, and the new adult performers are excellent. Kenneth Branagh is well-cast as the pompous celebrity wizard Guilderoy Lockhart, hired as the kids' second 'Defense Against the Dark Arts' professor. The particular standout here is new cast member Jason Isaacs, who is the very image of petty evil as Lucius, the father of Potter's nemesis Draco Malfoy. Some parents might feel Lucius' treatment of servant, the house-elf Dobby, is overly harsh but it introduces an important theme for the series. Contrary to what I'm tempted to think the film producers would like, 'Harry Potter' isn't just an action-fantasy story. This story introduces the important concept of 'mud-bloods' (wizards with one or more non-wizard parent) and the theme of prejudice and bigotry shown by 'pure-blood' wizards towards them.Other than that there's not that much to talk about. There's more Quiddich, more mystery and intrigue. This story has quite a few more horrific elements than the first, ranging from giant spiders to a spell that makes Ron vomit slugs. Hermione (Emma Watson) disappears for much of the film's running time under an evil spell, requiring Ron and Harry to think for themselves for once. The ending feels like a generic action scene in any Hollywood film, failing to capture the magic that the book did. Of course some of this is just the fault of actually being too close to the book. Dumbledore's phoenix clawing out the basilisk's eyes is an exciting concept but as a CGI on screen (particularly since they chose to make the phoenix awfully small) it just looks silly.One last word on the Gambon vs. Harris as Dumbledore controversy. Honestly as much as I respect Harris I just think he looked tired in this film and failed to capture the kind of energy that Dumbledore needs to have. Harris probably would have been an excellent Dumbledore if he had been healthy he's got all the screen presence that you need but none of the humor at this point in his career. I saw the first 4 movies before reading the books, and at first I felt Gambon was getting too goofy, losing the gravitas of the character. But after reading through the books I see that Gambon's performance is actually closer to what Rowling wrote. Harris' wizard is a bit more of a generic wise authority figure, where Gambon catches more of the particular side of Dumbledore that is sometimes wreckless and can be disarmingly whimsical  traits that make him seem less 'authoritative' but certainly more human, and are of increasing importance in the 6th and 7th books.All in all, I would argue that this film (like most of the others in the series) functions very well as a companion to the book but not so well as a stand-alone film for those who haven't read the series. Speaking as one who has seen the film both before and after reading the books I guess I should know. It's not a bad film, especially for those familiar with the details of the story that are left out which add depth (but which are not contradicted by the film for the most part), but it was a wise choice of the producers to hire a new director for the 3rd (and IMHO best so far).",6,7,9,13 August 2007
Rosemary's Baby," memorable atmospheric horror with Ruth Gordon
","Excellent suspenseful direction by Polanksi and a great cast highlight this prototype reproduction-shocker from the late 60s, a film that influenced many horror films to follow including the inferior 'Exorcist.' I love how Polanski lets his camera roam and linger about the massive apartment complex that is the film's central setting, making it the literal eye of the audience. I think maybe my favorite shot in the whole movie is when Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) are talking and she glances at the room where her husband, the appropriately named 'Guy' (John Cassavetes) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) are talking and we see only the vaguely sinister smoke drifting through the open doorway. I have a feeling that doorways and hallways in general have a symbolic significance in this film tied to its paranormal ruminations on pregnancy, but I'd have to rewatch it to analyze that aspect of the film.The story takes a little while to get going, but once we're into Rosemary's pregnancy the stakes begin to rise and suspense is unrelenting. There's also some great macabre humor thrown into the mix which reaches its apex in the film's famous 'shocker' ending. It's a very atmospheric horror without any gore and with only minimal scares, to the extent that it reminds me of Jacques Tourneur's horror films (indeed given Polanski's status as a Francophile it's almost certain he had seen and been inspired by his films).The music is also very memorable; I was already familiar with the tune from the album by 'Fantomas' with Mike Patton where they did a heavy metal cover of it, recommended for fans of this movie.But best of all are the performances from all 4 of the leads. Gordon and Blackmer are the highlight of the film for me with their wicked subversion of normal 'nice old neighbor' type performances. Gordon of course was herself a brilliant writer and probably recognized the high quality of the material she was working with here. She's a fussy old lady who hides her true evil intent behind a blustering annoying façade of the old lady who's just a little bit too helpful. Blackmer is a good tonic to her high energy performing, projecting a reassuring feeling that greatly helps in the final scene when he gently rocks the cradle. The implication of that scene, that the maternal instinct will win out over all other reasoning, is powerful and ironic. Cassavetes isn't perfect but he is suitable in the role, the only one of the 'villains' who actually had me guessing during much of the film's running time. And Farrow is a visual of gaunt helplessness, her eyes conveying fear and loss of control throughout the second half of the film. It's interesting that Polanksi says he initially envisioned a more 'corn-fed' starlet in the role, specifically Tuesday Weld. In my opinion Tuesday Weld was a better actress than Mia Farrow and probably would have provided the film with an even more powerful feeling. It's true that Farrow looks perfect in the early phases of her pregnancy when she's losing weight and becoming paler, but she's already so thin in the first place that I think it would have been even more shocking to see Weld in the same situation. But I really can't fault Farrow's performance besides just the physical aspects of her screen presence which she isn't in control of. It's obvious that she and Polanski were on the same wavelength, and it's extraordinary how the male director and female star were able to make the character such a strong cipher for the audience.",8,3,4,2 November 2007
Crazy Heart," Too much feel-good
","'Crazy Heart' is one of those movies that you've already seen before, but you won't mind too much seeing it again with these characters and these actors. It's a typical 'sunset of a legend' picture, complete with the wayward protégé, young saintly lover, and inspirational comeback. Along the way we're entertained by a number of decent songs.I don't really take any exception to the praise for Jeff Bridges' performance. He's always been a good actor and it was fun to see him perform this type of larger-than-life role. Given the similarities of this role to his work in Terry Gilliam's 'Tideland', this performance is basically another in the series of actors working with Gilliam and then turning their lessons towards more conventional fare to earn rave reviews. Which I have no problem with basically. His performance is solid, Duvall is solid even in a stupid mechanical role (the 'best friend/bartender who will help him get off alcohol... really?), Gyllenhaal does her best as the 'Saint Single Mommy' character given to her. Colin Farrell seems awfully out of place but maybe that was the point.I enjoyed the early honky-tonk scenes, there's a lot of authenticity I think to the way the concert scenes are shown, both the bowling-alley small town scene and the big arena shows. The movie goes off the rails for me about the point when he takes the single mom and her adorable son on a ballooning trip. It just starts going rapidly downhill into the areas of cheap sentiment and convenient plot twists. This is the #1 lazy Hollywood formula: when in need of an emotional hook, grab a cute kid and put them in danger. Gets 'em every time. Spielberg taught us that and now every other film imitates the lame formula. I was disengaged with the movie when it got into that kind of thing, just sort of exploiting people's fear of missing children in order to accomplish a strictly mechanical goal (motivating the character to clean up).I also wasn't crazy that the film showed his only way out as being to attend some 12-step program. Those people and that whole industry didn't need the free promotion. Ah, look how peaceful it is here in this rehab setting! Yes, huge insurance payments will do that. Inner peace? Not to be found in a ring of AA zombies or a finely manicured forest walkway with stream running through it. I would find more inner peace drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon fishing with Robert Duvall. The film manufactures a crisis in his health and then the really contrived situation with the missing child, just so that it can show that he couldn't keep being 'Bad' forever. The drama didn't arise from the situations; the situations arose from the writers' need for drama. This wouldn't be so glaring if so much of the rest of the movie wasn't so down-to-earth and understated (for instance, the restraint they showed in not turning Farrell's Tommy Sweet character into a bad guy).It's a mixed bag: Jeff Bridges fans should see it, people who like melancholy romantic dramas should see it, but those who are looking for a really exciting treatment will not find it.Incidentally, I have a sort of personal connection to the film: a couple weeks ago I saw the 2010 Bridge School Benefit, where the producer of this movie T. Bone Burnett performed 2 of the songs along with Jeff Bridges. Pretty cool. Kris Kristofferson also played earlier in the day. A coincidence? Perhaps....",6,1,6,5 November 2010
The Wrestler," good movie
","I really enjoyed this movie, which tells the tale of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former big-time pro wrestler fallen on hard times, most of which seem to be the result not of bad luck but bad planning and bad habits. Forced to compete in violent and dangerous stunt matches with other former big-timers and young wannabe wrestlers.It's the first film about pro wrestling that I've seen which shows the amount of brotherhood that exists between many of the wrestlers, the amount of planning and skill that goes into the matches, and so forth. It's also a story about a once great athlete, and so at times it veers or threatens to veer into rather standard melodramatic territory. For instance, the sub-plot with Randy's daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is fraught with peril but I'd say they did an OK job of it. I definitely like the Marisa Tomei character, even if the stripper with a heart of gold is sort of a cliché. I think Tomei and Rourke were able not only to put over a role that could be considered a stereotype, but to make a statement on the idea of typing in general. They are just such unique personages in terms of how they come off the screen, it defies the way that we tend to see each other in life in terms of very standard types. Randy is at the same time not what he seems at first to be and also the ultimate version of what he seems to be -- a fallen champion desperate to get back on top, but without the goods he needs to do it.The music is fun and a blast to hear after all these years, even if it wasn't my favorite at the time. I imagine there are lots of younger people today discovering the joys of Guns N' Roses and various bands like that thanks to this film which shows them in the same kind of nostalgic but steady-eyed perspective as Randy himself. People like 'The Ram' were the rulers of the world when I was a little kid in the 80s, and it's sad to think about some of them really falling from those positions. We could look at the pathetic aspects of Randy's life but at the same time he actually accomplished more than a lot of people ever do. The fact that he couldn't maintain a personal life ended up making the whole thing bitter and pointless in the end. Rourke performs the part perfectly, with a sense of pride and no regrets, a man waking up to certain realities that he's spent a lot of time and money trying to avoid.",8,6,7,23 March 2009
Ray," Just another standard biopicture
","I was kind of hoping that this film would be a bit better than some of the standard issue biopictures of musicians that we've seen over the years. Ray Charles was a great musician who had an interesting life story, after all. 2 of the film's producers were also the producers of 'La Bamba', the excellent biopicture about rocker Richie Valens. Best of all, the film-makers followed the tradition established by 'The Jolson Story' of using the original performer's voice (something that would have helped 'Walk the Line' perhaps).Alas, it was not to be. The script itself is primarily to blame, as it seems fundamentally confused about how realistic it wants to be. Some scenes feel so dry and are directed in such a distant way as to feel almost documentary. But other scenes hold forth with the sentimentality that we've come to expect from these epics; for example my girlfriend and I both laughed out loud when Ray Charles and his singer/girlfriend get in a fight and then the film cuts to them doing a ridiculously impassioned version of 'Hit the Road, Jack.' Jamie Foxx's performance was excellent and it was easy to forget while watching the film that it wasn't the real Ray Charles Robinson who we were watching. The supporting cast is fine but unexceptional. I found that I preferred the early parts of the film that explored his life before he was a superstar. The flashbacks to his childhood are very excessive, at least in the extended version I saw. Although the extended version does have a scene that I think is my favorite in the whole film, with Fox and Warwick Davis smoking a joint consoling each other about the pitfalls in the business and sharing their feelings of joy in performance itself.If I knew someone who was a teenager or whatever and had no idea who Ray Charles was, I would recommend the film to them as a good introduction. I think the way that the scene of the 'Chitlin' Circuit' was very well represented and would give them something of a history lesson, and the music is all excellent. But I would assume that other Ray Charles fans like myself (I saw the Genius on one of his last tours, at the Marin Center in CA) would find it somewhat unnecessary and perhaps excessive.",5,4,6,19 November 2008
Inception," All right.....
","The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice 'inception' on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're 'treated' to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like 'Total Recall' in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one.",6,31,56,23 August 2010
Paths of Glory," One of the best movies on war ever
","Impassioned examination of military injustice during WWI.  Douglas must defend 3 prisoners wrongly accused of cowardice and sentenced to be hung. Menjou is powerful and convincing as a military higher up who believes Douglas cares only for a promotion.  Beautiful photography in the style of Ophuls contrasts plush life of higher officers with the hell of trench war. Some melodrama, but all in all it's much less sentimental and also less spectacle-oriented than most war films (including Douglas and Kubrick's later 'Spartacus', which is a pompous bore).  Doublas only speechifies when the plot makes it a necessity (highly unusual for him, a trained Spencer Tracy wannabe).",10,1,3,28 October 2002
Shrek," It didn't amuse me
","I just couldn't wait for this one to end. Oh yeah, the effects and animation were good enough, but I just found the film's humor too obtuse. There wasn't a single joke that didn't walk right up and slap you in the face. Also, a lot of the humor was what I would call inappropriate for kids. I didn't like Murphy's donkey character, I didn't like Meyer's voice for 'Shrek' it made me think of his disgusting character in the second 'Austin Powers' movie. Cameron Diaz was well placed in her role. As if it wasn't bad enough, after the ending of the film I was compelled to watch a horrifying 'extra' ending with the 'lovable' cast dancing to awful music. This is the stuff of nightmares.",4,3,6,22 November 2004
Shrek," Diverting but little else
","A pretty good digital cartoon, which manages to create a fantasy world that is, for this die-hard true fantasy fan, too close to the 'real' world. Shrek is an ogre cast in the role of a hero, and he and his princess have to discover the real meaning of love, or something like that.  There is some OK comedy, but if the mule character doesn't appeal to you there is very little to enjoy here as far as that goes.  Meyer's voice for Shrek was too much like his one for 'Dirty Bastard' in AP2 to not escape distraction.
Tacked on to the video release is an excruciating extra karaoke ending, perhaps the worst concept in video marketing ever to reach fruition, but I suppose the kiddies must like it.I saw it on video, but this one seems like more of an audience-pleaser, and doesn't play too well to a fairly empty room.",4,2,4,1 March 2004
Vanilla Sky," Fascinating film
","This was a fun movie to go into 'cold', not having heard much about it. It seems to resolutely straddle a whole mix of genres, starting out seeming like a straightforward romantic dramedy and eventually morphing into a thriller and then a sci-fi film. It's a film about iconography and personality, the way we see our lives and the way we create a sort of universe for ourselves to live in, but in the Cruise character's case quite literally.Cruise's performance powers the movie, and at times he's very effective. Of course you couldn't find a more suitable actor to play this super-successful and gorgeous guy who's had everything in life. His friend (Jason Lee, who seems so casual that he's distracting) tells him about how you can't enjoy the 'sweet' without also tasting the 'sour.' It's a simple theme that's developed through the movie in more and less complex ways.The relationship between Kurt Russell's psychologist character and Cruise's masked 'killer' David is far more interesting and compelling than his friendship with the Lee character, and even perhaps arguably than the central romance between David and Penelope Cruz' Sofia. I really enjoyed Russell's work, and the moment of his self-realization at the climax is one of the most bizarre and effective moments of character acting in sci-fi genre history. The film is littered with fantastic character performances in fact; Timothy Spall and the always-riveting Tilda Swinton are among the best of these.Crowe's direction is less literal than usual, more vague and poetic. I still don't like the way he and his collaborators used music in this movie; I found it distracting. I realize that it was part of the whole idea of the iconography that's creating his world (the clue with the 'Freewheelin' Bob Dylan' cover was TOO obvious), but the mixture of new and old rock songs makes the film feel like it's old people straining too hard to be cool. All the Radiohead and that type of thing gets very tiring, and the choice of older songs like Peter Gabriel's 'Solsbury Hill' is too typical. I don't like the way 'Solsbury Hill' was used for example; I really don't appreciate music with lyrics playing over a dialog scene. I find myself listening too much to Gabriel's fascinating lyrics and trying to figure out if they have any connection to the scene, and I missed half of the dialog between Cruise and Cruz.In the end though, the film is a big winner. It's the type of film that presents a lot of ideas and lets the audience chew them over. We want to know ultimately what is going on, and the climactic revelation manages to still retain some of the original poetry and mystery. That's tough to pull off. Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise have never been better IMHO; the weird sex scene between them towards the end is very disturbing and effective. The film manages to tackle some big ideas in a really entertaining way, and it's a nice film to look at.",8,1,2,4 November 2009
Iron Man," Standard-issue superhero film raised slightly by good cast
","This film has gotten a lot of praise in comparison to most of the recent superhero films. For me, I thought it was a distracting film but nothing really special other than having an excellent cast. Downey Jr. is an unusual choice for a superhero to say the least. Unfortunately he's very restrained here and the performance itself isn't hugely interesting except compared to other superhero movies. He and Gwyneth Paltrow have a noticeable lack of chemistry, but I suppose that's part of the point? Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors and I loved seeing him take on a real 'baddie' role even though his performance was obscured towards the end by the mechanical apparatus he's been surrounded with.To get into the real mediocrity of this movie, we could look at Terence Howard's character, the sort of friendly co-operative military figure. First of all ignoring the fact that the friendship between Stark and this character, Col. Rhodes, represents an unholy alliance between industry and military.... and the fact that nothing essentially changes in the relationship after Stark's 'reformation', I'd have to ask why was the character missing from the entire middle portion of the film? It got so obvious that I said to my brother (I was at the drive-in, so it wasn't too rude to talk) 'hey, we haven't seen Terence Howard in a while' and sure enough he showed up in the very next scene. It's paint by the numbers stuff, really, for the most part this film has nothing new to offer. The Middle-Eastern villain is the most hilarious stupidity the film puts forth, a kind of Osama Bin Laden on steroids.By the end of the movie the explosions and battle have become monotonous. You can only watch so much of this stuff before the drama bleeds away and all you have is empty action. I never felt like there was a moment of unpredictability or surprise in any of the fighting.Nevertheless, I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, just very average. For people who really enjoy superhero movies I would guess it is actually very good. The sci-fi elements are somewhat more interesting than usual as well. The cast brings a quality to the film that it wouldn't have otherwise, because these are not particularly well-written characters. It's a movie where the two main protagonists enjoy pole dancing on a jetplane, and it's supposed to make us feel more empathetic towards them. There is some fun to be had in the glossy way it presents its action and in the irony with which it drapes superhero conventions.",5,1,3,15 June 2008
Blade Runner," Best Sci-Fi film of the 80s
","Blade Runner is a surprise, a delight, an enigma, and a triumph of will. Having read a book on the making of blade runner, I found out how hard it was to actually get this film made.  Like other Philip Dick adaptions, this movie preserves his interesting premises on artificial intelligence (although it completely reverses them, Dick is not a dogmatic or ideological sci-fi writer like Stanislaw Lem or Arthur Clarke, both esteemed but inferior writers next to Dick) while pasting them on a superficial action story.  Where Blade Runner becomes a great film is in the many layers of meaning contained in the film, some of which are surely unintentional to writers, director and definately actors.  This film has an A-list of fabulous character actors, many of whom are still with us:  Joanna Cassidy, Joe Turkel, J. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson among others.  Daryl Hannah is only competent but the real reason Harrison Ford hates this movie (publicly) is because Rutger Hauer completely stole it from him.  Hauer's performance turns villainy inside-out, and I only wish they had given some kind of reason for his more sadistic moments -- i guess we're supposed to accept his childlike attitude about life extends to violence as well.  I think there are many facets of the relationships between the characters (particularly Ford's and Young's) that are not spelled out, so many viewers may think that the superficial action yarn is all that's going on (I remember the first time I saw it thinking it was absolutely awful). The movie's plot is pretty disjointed, but I think in this way it mirrors other successful noirs like 'The Big Sleep.'  The music is excellent, Vangelis' best work, and I can hear its influence in much of the electronic music of the 90s.  This movie is almost single-handedly responsible for the surge in widescreen format presentations on video and television, and I think for that we should all be very grateful to an all-time cult classic that gets better every year.",10,0,0,9 May 2001
Blade Runner," great movie -- dir cut vs. non
","Great sci-fi movie.... one of the best.  Everybody should see it.   The movie was only confusing to en masse hollywood audiences, where it tested poorly and received a 'happy' ending (film-lover's bit:  the footage of sweeping hills of grains were lifted from outtakes from the credit sequence of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining').  And don't believe the all-too-obvious interpretation of the unicorn dream.   There are many layers to this movie. I think most of the extra layers come from the fact that the characters' relationships are never what they appear to be.  Scott manages to surprise the audience a lot, and turn around our notions of what good and evil may be.  But as for this 'see the non-director's version', forget it.  The dialogue a la 50s noir movie is CHEEZY!  It also gets in the way of the music in several key parts of the movie, early on, where the hokey monologue breaks into what should be simply breathtaking views of LA underscored by Vangelis.Anyway, great movie, see the director's version, love it, live it, see it more than once before you judge of it.  Peace.",10,0,0,10 December 1998
Blade Runner," Classic sci-fi
","This is the movie that all the other 'sci-fi' films of the last 20 years have been trying, unsuccessfully, to live up to.  Some of them have achieved more compelling action, some spiffy CGI effects, but none of them can match the grandeur of this film's vision or its colorful gallery of characters.The film's action stylings and detective story plot are mostly a cover for the issues it broods over:  what is it that makes us human?  How indeed do I know that I am human?The answers concern a complex meditation on memory, something that previous to 'Blade Runner' had been the strict domain of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman.  BR took sci-fi film and pushed it into adult territory, just when the 'Star Wars' revolution was threatening to turn the tide forever in favor of 'space opera'.  'Blade Runner' brought us back to the days of the German silents ('Metropolis', 'Aelita') in which a dark, uncertain future was coupled with doubts about the worth or meaning of human existence.
There is a lot to look at here, with beautiful photography, and inspired direction and a batch of memorable performances from the excellent supporting cast.  Hauer steals the movie from the seemingly disinterested Ford, particularly in the film's stunning finale.This movie is also notable for the depth of detail that was put into its futuristic vision.  Everything enforces the notion that this is an Earth we would not want to live in, and somewhat oblique dialogue occasionally hints that (as Dick's novel makes clear) Deckard would in fact not be on Earth if he was healthy enough to leave.  This is a future where you can't even order as much food as you want at a restaurant.Now that we are closer to '2019' than we are to the production of this film, we can assess how much of what it is saying came true.  The specifics of the technology and culture aren't really what's important; genetic research and modern philosophy keep the ideas in this movie fresh and relevant -- perhaps even more so when this movie appeared and quickly disappeared (failing to capture the attention of the action movie public).There are numerous inferior imitations ('AI', 'Minority Report', 'The Matrix', etc.) But this one will be around for a long time after they have been forgotten.",10,0,1,20 November 2002
The Deer Hunter," Overly emotional, but effective
","By the end of this very long film, I felt quite a bit emotionally drained and somewhat manipulated. Although I feel like it contained some really great performances, from everyone really including the supporting cast (especially George Dzundza and John Savage) but especially De Niro, Walken and Streep, ultimately I think the film was a bit heavy-handed and at times improbable. The details of the Vietnamese POW camp feel exaggerated, although the two scenes with Russian roulette were very powerful. It was really odd that De Niro could just walk back into Saigon though at that point.What I liked best about the movie was the way De Niro's performance changed so subtly in the parts of the movie when he returns home after the war. He conveys a totally different state of mind -- again the film hammers the point home more than it really needs to by including that whole scene with him deliberately missing the stag he's tracking. De Niro's acting alone would suffice, I've rarely seen him stronger. Same with Walken, he really was excellent in this movie especially at the end when he seems almost literally like a ghost.Was the ending supposed to be satirical? I don't think so but it was a little over the top with them all singing 'God Bless America.' I just couldn't buy it.One thing that I felt was that it is possible to see the movie as De Niro's character being in love with Walken's. At the end he tells him 'I love you', (SPOILERS) similar to Sam Fuller's 'I Shot Jesse James.' I think that he and the Streep character were basically in love with the same man.",7,0,3,24 July 2008
Amélie," wasn't anybody else really disappointed by this film?
","I have seen the other two films by this director, and I really enjoyed both of them, especially the City of Lost Children, which I thought was one of the best pop sci-fi films since Star Wars.  But this film was a real disappointment, loaded with treachly sentiment and annoying characters, not the least of which is the title character who spends the whole movie tormenting people when it's really none of her business and then the director thinks he can show a wide angle overhead shot of her smiling and we'll suddenly like her.  Well, I don't like her character at all, and the films moments of joy are little more than tired imitations of Truffaut or Goddard.  Let's get Jeunet and Caro back together again so this guy can make some good exciting movies.",4,3,10,13 September 2002
The Producers," great
","Zero Mostel blew me away in this film (even though I've seen enough of his work that I shoulda seen it comin'!), which I think is the best Mel Brooks film that I've seen. He manages to make Max one of those classic 'lovable scoundrels' while at the same time providing a plausible mentor for Gene Wilder's Leo, a young accountant who Max cajoles and corrupts into joining his scheme to produce Broadway's biggest ever flop. Along the road from profitable failure to disastrous success, Leo emerges from the shell of his insecure conservatism to become a jaded -- and free-spirited -- fellow manipulator.Although the film often feels somewhat 'stage-bound', I'd still argue that it's the most cinematic project I've seen from Brooks. That's partly because here he isn't spoofing a particular genre and adopting its visual style, but mostly because of the greater depth and resonance of the characters. I especially enjoyed the 'seduction' scene with Mostel and wilder at the big Parisian-styled fountain -- I felt the magic of cinema there in a way that I've never really felt with a Brooks movie before. I felt myself really wishing I could see this in the theater with a bunch of other people instead of at home on DVD with my girlfriend.At times the humor is a bit obvious, leaning as Brooks often does on simple puns. But the characters -- including supporting ones like Dick Shawn's wasted hippie 'L.S.D.', Kenneth Mars' suitably overstated Nazi playwright, and Estelle Winwood as a violently lusty crone -- keep things moving pleasantly. The performances are good and the dialog unusually subtle for any comedy.I felt the conclusion was a little bit of a letdown, even if it was just Brooks being self-reflexive on the obvious nature of dramatic resolution (courtroom scenes are the very definition of 'obligatory'). But the way the play itself unfolded, though again perhaps a bit too fast and obvious, provides an insightful and humorous view of the subjectivity of the artistic experience in general.An excellent film, featuring Zero Mostel at the peak of his considerable genius and Brooks at his most restrained and human.",8,4,5,27 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Satisfying but unoriginal reboot
","Everybody seems to either be jumping up and down for joy or chomping at the bit to dissect and destroy this film -- I thought it was just good clean fun, nothing as memorable as the original films but nothing to really complain about if you're a fan of this type of thing. The new characters are pretty well developed, especially John Boyega's 'Finn', who has some of the attributes of Han Solo in the original film but who is also amusingly man-childish, which makes sense considering that his character has been locked up in a military academy and mopping floors on the death star in his spare time. It's charming when he flirts with Rey (Daisy Ridley) like a 14 year old with his first crush, and when he's reunited with pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), he thinks Poe is serious when he starts ribbing him ('hey, that's my jacket!').The big drawback, at least for those of us who are familiar with the original films (which is to say, about 2 billion people on this planet), is that it's basically a remake of the first 'Star Wars' film. It begins with an orphan on a desert planet who finds a droid with important data, its emotional climax comes 30 minutes before the end of the movie with the death of a primary character, and its main threat is another 'technological terror' capable of destroying entire planets. We even get treated to another dull scene where Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) sits in a room staring at a holograph while the men go off and fight the bad guys. Perhaps with all the fans complaining about Lucas' 'prequel' films not being enough like the originals, the screenwriters (including Lawrence Kasdan from the original films) thought that people really just wanted a remake.It's neither good enough nor bad enough to deserve as much attention as its getting. It possesses neither the highs nor the lows of the prequel films. As he did with 'Star Trek', director Abrams has managed to bleed all political meaning out of the series. The film's weakest element is its villains -- Andy Serkis' 'Snook' is just a big CGI that looks, feels and sounds like Gollum from the Tolkien movies. Adam Driver's 'Kylo Ren' (one thing you can say about the movie is that at least they keep the streak of ridiculous names going, although nothing here is as golden as 'Count Dookoo') is a pouty emo-kid whose only interesting element is that he seems to admire 'grandfather' Darth Vader but doesn't seem to be quite evil enough to stand a comparison with him. Worst of all is Domhnall Gleason's one-note politician bad guy, who seems to be in the movie simply to fulfill whatever vague role Grand Moff Tarkin had in the original film.People who like 'Star Wars' movies are going to enjoy it. People who think 'Star Wars' movies are the greatest thing ever are going to hate it, because nothing is ever good enough for them. Everybody else is just going to forget about most of it a few months from now.",7,4,19,28 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The classic film trilogy comes to a close
","Fans of the original animated version of 'LOTR' were disappointed when Ralph Bakshi announced it would never be completed: 'King' saw a release by itself in a version produced by Rankin/Bass, the team which produced 'The Hobbit'. So, in other words, many fans have been waiting an AWFULLY long time for this one, as well as for the whole trilogy.I think the most impressive aspect of this film, certainly from a technical standpoint, is the incredibly lifelike characterization of Gollum, aided greatly by Andy Serkis' vocal work.  That said, there is less development and, generally, less of Gollum in this third film, which may explain why this film is less satisfying than '2 Towers'.  Gollum was a strong asset to making the second film even more impressive than the first, but 'King' has no such ace up its sleeve; it is rather stuck with the task of wrapping up loose ends (at long long last) and saying goodbye to now-cherished characters.  I think that we have to wait until 'King' sees release on DVD to make a full estimate of its value relative to the other 2 films, since at this point (Feb 03, one day after its victory at the Academy Awards) we can only compare a truncated version of this film to a complete version of the other 2.  This film feels, even more so than did the other 2, as if something important is missing in the theatrical version.  This may be because the filmmakers, now knowing that most fans will see the DVD version more often and over a longer period of time, have decided that they can be a bit looser with the theatrical version.I don't necessarily think 'Return of the King' was the best film of 2003, but it probably deserved the Oscar just for the achievements of the trilogy as a whole.  American film fans have grown tired of derivative, stale sequels and so this trilogy is very refreshing because it has a different story in each part.Tolkien's work has been translated to the screen masterfully here, and although I as well as all other lifetime fans will find much to pick at here, there is so much more to be thankful for.  That said, my major criticism of this film is in its truncated ending, skipping the 'scouring of the Shire' section of the book which Jackson apparently does not consider important.  I can understand not including it if his purpose was to wrap the story up as quickly as possible after its first major conclusion.  But, instead of the scouring we get an extended scene in which each major character goes one at a time (and often in slow motion, Jackson't most egregious fault as a director) into Frodo's 'hospital room' and talks to him, which scene is followed by another scene with everyone bowing down to Aragorn, etc. etc.  The film could probably have combined these 2 scenes and left room for the scouring.Why do I think it is so important?  Not so much for the plot, but because it illustrates beautifully Tolkien's concept that home is never the same place you left behind.  They tried to do it in the film by showing Frodo sitting alone in his room.  Here is the problem:  in '2 Towers' Frodo sees the burning of the Shire and a huge mechanical mill in the Shire -- in the film Galadriel tells him that this is what might happen, if they fail.  In the book, this is the future, and it is the future that Frodo and his friends find in the Shire, regardless of the fact that they 'won' the war.  This biting commentary was Tolkien's last stab at the 'glory' of war, and I think it belonged in the movie, whereas removing it makes the ending a bit too sunny for my tastes, and relative to I think Tolkien's wishes.Anyway, an excellent movie that we will no doubt be returning to from time to time for the rest of our lives.",9,2,4,1 March 2004
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Still fun after all these years
","I still remember when the movie came out -- how stupid and awful the trailers looked, and how surprised I was when I really enjoyed the movie. I think the key to the movie's success and its charm is how open it is about being what it is. This is a stupid movie about stupid people, but I didn't see a more enjoyable movie of this type until just a few years ago when 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle' came out. The annals of film history will not be cluttered by mention of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as one of the great comedy duos. But what I find appealing about it is that it never descends to mawkish sentiment like John Hughes movies ('Planes Trains and Automobiles' and 'The Breakfast Club') for example and his imitators' films always do. In fact one of Reeves' immediate follow-ups, 'Parenthood' which starred Steve Martin, was exactly such a horrendous film. The ultimate point of this movie, saving the universe by way of Steve Salas and Joe Satriani-style whining blues-less guitar rock solos, is just as absurd as its main characters.The interesting thing about Bill and Ted as a comedy duo is that neither of them are the 'straight man' in particular. There's no attempt to paint either of them as particularly more attractive, intelligent, or interesting than the other. To some extent George Carlin's Rufus acts as a straight man but he only appears in a few scenes and seems to share Bill and Ted's excellently poor taste in music and grammar. Basically the humor and the appeal of Bill and Ted are the same thing -- they are just so stupid and so optimistic that I think it'd be hard to really hate them. They do the same kind of comedy that Pauley Shore and Adam Sandler did for the next decade: valley-guy moron over his head in whatever situation. But because there's two of them they don't get annoying like those guys do, because there's an endearing quality in their friendship and their trust in each other.The reason I wouldn't rate the movie very highly is that a lot of the jokes do fall pretty flat upon a repeat viewing and the movie loses a lot of steam in the middle sections set in Medieval times. But compared to its sequel and most other movies of this type it's a masterpiece because it's actually watchable.",6,0,1,14 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," More credit to Gary Kurtz
","All-time classic of cheezy pop space battle opera.  Poorly developed characters are given life by the excellent cast, especially Ford (who rose to fame in the role) and Guinness.  Story from the Kurosawa film 'The Hidden Fortress' is full of climaxes, but Lucas keeps the pace moving and the film never fails to entertain audiences of all ages.  The goriest of all the series (just look for severed arms and bloodtrails);  Ford is more convincingly 'hardboiled' here than in the sequels (in the last of which, sadly, he is reduced to trading one-liners with the robot comic relief duo). A few notes on this film.  I was surprised not to see the uncredited script contributions by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck here on IMDB.  As Lucas' more recent solo efforts show, a lot of the credit for ANY believability in the dialogue, not to mention good structure to the film, should be credited to them.  In fact, a lot of the reason this film is great has nothing to do with Lucas; it's a solid production that came in under fire, and more credit should go to Gary Kurtz than is generally given.  In fact, although you won't have much trouble finding a 'Star Wars' fan who can tell you all about the eating habits of the Wookie (or whatever), you won't find many who even know the name of the film's producer.  Most fans agree that the first and second films ('Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes Back') are far and away the best he has made, but few people have connected this fact with producer Gary Kurtz, who has been absent from Lucas' subsequent efforts. Although the second film is more polished and is much better directed, this first one is I think the true all-time classic because it's just so much fun and it has no shame in being what it is.  You don't yet see the infusion of puppets that followed Lucas' semi-merger with Jim Henson Enterprises in the 80s, you don't see fuzzy teddy bears killing professional soldiers, but you do get a princess with a really weird hairdo (all respect to Carrie Fisher for even being able to carry off the part without laughing; some of the lines she has to say are just too much), guys with laser swords fighting, and cool space battles.  That's another thing -- hasn't anyone else noticed that the cool space dogfights that were the high point of the first trilogy are totally absent from Lucas' last two Star Wars films?  The battle in Episode I was very short and unexciting, and there was no outer space battle at all in Episode II. One thing that makes the film such a classic is that it is so involved.  No matter how many times I see it, I always seem to notice some new object lying around that I can wonder about, or some nuance in the acting (which is mostly very broad, I will admit) that has implications I haven't considered. There are also some technical flaws and continuity errors that are fun to look for. One very smart move Lucas (or, more likely, Kurtz, since this looks to me like a 'frozen funds' film for Fox) made was to involve 2 very solid British character actors:  Guinness and Peter Cushing.  These 2 anchor the movie in case the robots and guys in suits hadn't proved convincing (which they did). A lot of people don't comment on Cushing in this movie, but I think he's great here as always at implying a menace that is carefully controlled within a strong personality.  There are some interesting scenes were Vader appears to defer to Tarkin, making him the senior power in the Empire, while there is a suggestion that Vader is simply humoring Tarkin. However you break it up, though, this one is for all time.",10,4,8,4 November 2002
300," a dirty shame
","Let's start with the good -- the visual style is clearly this film's main asset. The filmmakers have confidence in the ability of the images to tell the most important aspects of the story. For example Xerxes' coins  we get a prolonged scene of the temple priests (who, strangely enough, look kind of like the aliens in 'V') admiring the gold they received from Xerxes to give a negative prophecy, and then later gold falls out of the purse of the politician Theron (Dominic West), revealing his corruption. But a lot of movies, especially nowadays, would have to dumb it down by having some dude say out loud 'hey, that's Xerxes' coin!' or something like that. Like I said, '300' has confidence in its visual storytelling.And it needs to  because the dialog is terrible. Liberally taking its best lines from Rudolph Mate's 1962 film 'The 300 Spartans' isn't enough to solve the dialog problems. I'm not sure if a lot of the actors were poor or if they were poorly directed, because I haven't seen many of them in other films. But I've seen more compelling dialog in episodes of 'Xena: Warrior Princess'. In fact the whole film felt to me somewhat like a high budget TV-show. The entire environment is so hyper-stylized that I just couldn't imagine myself into that space if you know what I mean. It was interesting to look at, but hard to look into or to imagine that it could be a real space in any world. For instance, whenever the Spartans drove people or animals off the ledge, you never saw how those people or animals actually got from the open plain into this tiny space where they would allow themselves to be forced off the cliff. The film didn't create a realistic space for these events to take place in, and in fact the battle in general was not shown in any kind of way that was interesting or realistic from a strategic standpoint. The Spartan king Leonidas (Gerald Butler) talks about how they fight in a phalanx and even one Spartan dying will ruin their strategy, but then when they actually fight they only fight in the phalanx formation at the very beginning of the battles and quickly dissolve into random groups of fighters. Everyone except the Spartans seems to have been inflicted with a 'Matrix-esque' slow-motion disease so that the Spartans can stab and spear them at will.The great weakness for me in the film is that it takes itself too seriously. With a little dose of camp or even just irony, the film might be palatable. But this film actually has less humor than 'Shindler's List' intentional humor anyway, because I laughed at a lot of the idiotic scenes like Spartan warriors raising their spears in the air to the strains of generic heavy metal music and a King Xerxes who looks like he just emerged from an S&M boutique. I watched incredulously as one of Leonidas' men called to his son at the end of the battle; the son was so distracted by an old man shouting his name on the other side of the battlefield that he didn't hear a large horse coming up behind him and cutting his head off. Then in the aftermath of this event, we are treated to a cheesy speech by the bereaved father that made me laugh out loud.I can't forget to mention the film's extremely questionable politics and morals. I recently watched 'The 300 Spartans' and was not surprised to see a lot of stuff in the film that would today be very 'politically incorrect'. But it was surprising to see so many of these elements both repeated and embellished in this new version. Kind of refreshing actually that they didn't bother to make concessions to modern politics. But it's not like the film's creators can cry 'historical accuracy' (after all, in real history there were no lizard-priests in Greece nor mutants with axes for arms). In fact the writers have gone out of their way to falsify history in order to fit the Spartans into modern ideas of masculinity. Leonidas, for example, mocks the Athenians as 'boy lovers' despite the fact that the Spartans practiced homosexuality as part of official military policy. Xerxes is depicted with decidedly homo-erotic overtones, and his overtures to Leonidas have a sexual nature. The film seems to be saying that no greater evil could befall Leonidas and holding him up for praise for resisting. When you put these 2 scenes together it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that the film exploits fear and hatred of homosexual people. For personal reasons I find this reprehensible, and for aesthetic reasons I find this cheap. If you take the film seriously (and it seems to take itself seriously, being totally without humor), it is almost an advertisement for fascism  the heroes of this movie serve with the understanding that the individual exists for the service of the state, not the state to serve the citizen. By mocking the Athenians and deliberately marginalizing their role in the Peloponnesian War (which the original film showed more accurately to Herodotus' account) this film purports to show heroes who stand up for 'freedom' and 'reason' while embracing a culture where the vast majority were slaves and where even 'free' men existed only to service the State. This is compounded by the treatment of the Thespians, who in the film are shown retreating in fear whereas to my knowledge twice as many Thespians died as Spartans. Only by including the Athenians and other Greeks would we get a valid picture of who the Spartans were and what role they filled in Greek culture. Instead in this film we have this simple-minded portrayal of the Spartans as the only worthwhile Grecians, and therefore an implication that fascist states are superior to easily corrupted democracies and that warriors are inherently superior to politicians or philosophers.",3,4,7,16 August 2007
The Great Escape," Not such a great escape
","Loosely based on the true story of 70-odd American, British, and other allied prisoners of war who escaped from jail to deliberately throw confusion on Germany and divert troops from the front lines.  Top cast of character actors makes the most of all the scenes and the action is good, so one doesn't tend to notice the film's excessive length too much.  Lots of thought went into making the film relatively inoffensive to the European market, even including sympathetic Germans and courageous Frenchmen, cheapening the film's realism.",5,6,20,11 October 2002
Jackie Brown," Unlike other Tarantino film, better on second viewing
","I first saw this movie on opening night and was somewhat disappointed. I think in retrospect that I was expecting too much the same thing I got from 'Pulp Fiction'. Specifically I was disappointed that Sam Jackson and Robert Deniro's characters were such small time criminals and just not 'badass' enough. I thought it was kind of a waste of their talents. Thinking about it now, I realize why would you want to see Deniro and Jackson repeat previous performances? Tarantino did something new with them in this film and they both turned in very interesting performances that are better than the vast majority of their work in film since.Just in general, I really think this is the best Tarantino film I've seen except 'Reservoir Dogs'. Why? Because the characters are more real and the plot/story is more focused. I love the performances he got out of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both of them are fantastic actors who really were wasted through most of the 80s and 90s until Quentin came along and basically rescued him, like he did for Travolta. Except Forster and Grier are way better than Travolta, and turn in excellent and nuanced performances here. The chemistry between them is perfect.A few tangential comments. The music is good, as usual, the first time I saw it I felt it was a bit forced. But I realize now that it was part of the 'verite' effect he was going after. Having the characters interact with the music makes the music seem a bit more obtrusive, but it also makes the film seem more real.There is a lot of good character work in this film too. Keaton is great as a youngish cop, the 'nice guy' in the routine. Fonda shines as a slutty stoner, the type of girl who makes fun of her boyfriend to his friends when he's not there, as if that would make them seem more appealing or sophisticated. In fact there is a very nice kind of 'dovetailing' effect where you really don't notice the difference between the performances of the 'stars' and the 'character actors'. The 'stars' (Forster, Grier, Jackson) get to do basically just an expanded version of character work, and it makes for an even more seamless film than 'Pulp Fiction' which at times feels bogged down by the weight of its stars.All in all, a good story with good actors makes for a good film, if a bit slow in the end when we have to see the 'heist' from multiple viewpoints despite its predictability.",7,5,6,11 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best in the original trilogy
","It's wonderful that Lucasfilm has finally consented to release this film in its original format without new additions and alterations. Now we can see the original matte work and effects, which are quite beautiful accomplishments and stand among the best of their era.The film is the best directed of the entire series, suffering from none of Lucas' poor directing of actors and Marquand's tentative camera handling. That said, Kershner himself is not an exceptional director except insofar as how he works with actors and his light comic touch. This film relies heavily on storyboarding and sticking fairly closely to its script, which was penned by Lucas himself from a draft by the great Leigh Brackett, with further refinement by Lawrence Kasdan.The story takes the characters from the original film, with the addition of the charming Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), further along their personal and political quests. The film does a good job of developing these characters far beyond what their potential in the original film or their treatment in the disappointing subsequent 'Jedi' were able to suggest, and of tying in the development of the characters' relationships with each other parallel to the plot of the film. The only unfortunate aspect in terms of the film's pacing is that the most exciting battle sequences fall so early in the film, leaving us a bit let down by the film's dialog-heavy middle section until we get to the stirring (and somewhat dark) conclusion in Cloud City.It's notable that this is almost the only Star Wars film that does not feature the desert planet Tatooine. This can be seen as symbolic of the fact that this was the film that George Lucas had the least to do with -- Tatooine represents his hometown of Modesto in the other films. I also do not consider it a coincidence that this, almost universally acknowledged by fans as the best in the series, was the one with which George Lucas had the least involvement. I've always believed that a lot of the credit for the success of these first 2 films should belong to the producer Gary Kurtz, a fellow USC grad who cut his teeth working with Roger Corman (producing Monte Hellman's first films) and who developed these 2 films' concept of 'used space' visual design which was later abandoned in favor of a glossy more standard 'new space' look. These 2 productions are on a higher level overall than anything that Lucas did after the partnership ended, which is particularly striking in that the excessively bright and shiny 'Jedi' followed only a few years later. Kurtz went on to produce 'The Dark Crystal' -- a superior production IMHO to any of Lucas' solo (read: non Spielberg/Kurtz) efforts.",9,1,2,8 January 2007
Windtalkers," a disposable war movie?
","This is a pretty disappointing movie considering the kind of resources that were spent on it and the apparent care that went into the production. It looks fantastic but there just is not a real core of human feeling, at least nothing that I personally could connect to. Partly that's because the first half of the film seems to have a very confused narrative focus. It's partly the film about a bitter Marine (Nicholas Cage) who gets injured and has to take a relatively peaceful assignment with a group of Native Americans who are enlisted by the Marines so that their language can be used as a basis for an unbreakable code. For no particularly compelling reason the story focuses on Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) and a friend he brings along to the war.Beach put in a decent performance but doesn't have much to work with. There's a lot of talk about past racial history and the irony of the fact that the 'Indians' are now fighting with the Americans. One character even speculates about how we might be sitting here 50 years from now with the Japanese trying to figure out 'how to kick somebody else's butt' (or words to that effect). Stuff like this is really annoying to me because it's not the kind of thing that anyone would be talking about in that situation; it's obviously just some junk they thought would seem ironic to people nowadays. So much of the dialog in this movie is forced and awkward like that. The movie is crushed beneath the weight of its pretenses. After the end of the film there's a beautiful shot of Cage in a close-up with a weary expression on his face. I saw that and I said 'oh, there's the performance! Why don't I remember him showing his character like that in the actual movie?' And it's because the movie doesn't even dare to stop long enough or to slow down so that you can appreciate anything that's happening. From the very first scenes it's just action action action, and I really felt a bit sick especially as the film went on because it seemed to me to blur the lines between action and violence. Kind of like 'Rambo II' and about equally worthless, although at least that film didn't burden itself with hokey reflections of racial politics  and perhaps more significantly it didn't take place during a real conflict. My girlfriend (who has a brother in Iraq) was so offended by the tone and style of the movie that we got in an argument just because I wanted to finish it. I think if you just wanted to see this as an action movie and ignore all the other elements it could be an OK action movie. But since this movie pretends and/or attempts to be much more and fails so horribly I would not recommend it to anyone. It didn't make me feel anything dramatic until maybe the very end because it never felt like anything more than a video game shoot-em-up. I can't say it's a reprehensible movie without watching it again, but it made me feel pretty uncomfortable in an unconstructive way if you know what I mean.",4,2,2,17 October 2007
Braveheart," why this movie sucks
","I saw this awful piece of trash because it was supposed to have these great battle scenes that compare to 'Spartacus'.  In a similar Kubrickian twist, I'm equally as disappointed by this film as I was by the comparison made between '2001' and 'Contact' (an equally stupid overblown movie).  OK, a comparison between thousands of barely armed desperate rebels being slaughtered in the hundreds by giant rolling balls of burning hay to fifty dudes in skirts with maces on a muddy field is JUST NOT THERE.The problems run deeper.  The 'freedom' theme in this movie is overly simplistic.  OK, I'm an idealist, but if a movie's gonna be anything more than entertaining, if it's gonna have pretensions to being relevant in some way to real life, as this movie does, it better not have no meat on its bones.  This movie's theme goes nowhere beyond pure shining heart idealism that nobody could really believe in.  IN war, everybody gets dirty.  I know that, everybody knows that, but this movie of good guys vs. bad guys is NOT a great movie. It's just not.  It's just entertainment, and even on that level it fails because it's too long and the acting is terrible.  Bombzers on this one.",1,17,41,10 December 1998
Moon," very intriguing straightforward character-oriented sci-fi
","The buzz I've heard around 'Moon' is that it's a throwback to the more tasteful and intelligent sci-fi films of the 70s, films that didn't tend to feel the need for big action scenes with special effects to put across a theme and an idea. But I felt that it was less of a throw-back than an all-around aberration, because the story and the ideas are so straightforward that they defy also the gimmick-heavy rules of the 1970s cycle. Sam Rockwell plays astronaut Sam Bell, a man who seems less of a scientist in the classic sci-fi sense than a technician; his job is to maintain energy gathering robot facilities on the Earth's moon, a job which is supposed to last 3 years. A delayed communications system enables him to keep in loose contact with his wife and daughter on Earth. But when a crash while repairing one of his units leaves him incapacitated, a chain of events is set into motion whereby he will discover his true identity and purpose in life, achieving a kind of existential wisdom at the expense of all possibility of happiness.While it's starting to feel as if many of the ideas in these movies are played out – clones, artificial intelligence, space exploration, etc. – this movie took a different tack by using a very tasteful and measured narrative approach so that the character would stand up stronger than the shopworn ideas. In terms of what could actually be called 'sci-fi ideas', this film is no more advanced than something like Michael Bay's 'The Island' and closer to '2010' than to '2001.' I found myself not caring too much because the point of the film seemed to me more based around character and story than ideas. The people behind it didn't feel the need to use a whole ton of action scenes and CGI effects just for the sake of impressing people; they just let the story be what it is and told it in a very direct way. This may be to the distaste of some sci-fi fans and also some effects fans, but I think it was an admirable effort that makes the film stand very much on its own. Rockwell's performance is very impressive, managing to convey two different personalities present in the same person, to play the same person at two different times in his life in very different ways. The element of the story with the robot GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey, of course) looks and sounds a lot like HAL in '2001', but of course this story doesn't just take itself in the same direction but rather plays with our expectations that it might. What I really like about this movie the most is that it seems so devoid of 'movie moments' – it seems unpredictable simply by being sort of predictable. I feel that the sci-fi is merely the setting for a good character-oriented story, and in that sense it's a more mature sci-fi, compared to most effects spectacles out there it's like 'The Naked Spur' compared to a Gene Autry movie. It's sci-fi world is not so much a future world, or a chance to get political about energy shortages, as it is an existential examination of one man's relationship to his environment and himself.",9,0,2,8 March 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Somewhere between the Road and Thunderdome.....
","While not reaching the dizzy dystopian heights of 'The Road Warrior', this film at least does not have the uneven quality or the naked sentiment of 'Beyond Thunderdome', so in a sense this new film from George Miller has saved the series -- it wasn't right for 'Max' to end on a bad note. I've heard one person say, 'it's too bad Mel Gibson couldn't be in it.' But only one person. Most people I think recognize that his presence would only have complicated things; besides which, Tom Hardy is arguably better in the role than Gibson ever was. He's much more adept at disappearing into the role, and portraying Max as somebody who, rather than imposing his will on his environment, rolls with whatever is happening to him and tries to adapt and survive. I halfway think that the reason George Miller waited so long to make this film is that he wanted Gibson to be too old so that he wouldn't be criticized for replacing him. I know that I wasn't supposed to take the film totally seriously, but the whole carnival/heavy metal aspect of the villains was just too much for me to take. Apparently, when the apocalypse happened a bunch of head bangers (as we used to call them) got together and decided to create a new society based on the lyrics to Slayer and Metallica songs. Everybody knows that it's absolutely essential in the post- apocalyptic environment to have your flaming guitar player with you when you set out on a desperate mission. Can't leave him at home. To me, the presence of these silly elements does detract somewhat from the film's themes of survival and dignity in the midst of social disintegration. My other problem with the movie is the aggressive way that Miller used the flashbacks to the dead/endangered child. 'The Road Warrior' stands alone, without much reference to his family or to anything that happened in the first film -- so why did Miller and/or his writers think it was so important for this film to constantly refer back to the dead family? The dialogue about redemption was heavy- handed and literal. For every problem, there are a half dozen excellent and fun things about the movie, so I am recommending it to people, but I would say it's not as good as the first two films. I loved the earth mamas on their bikes ('One bullet, one man') -- oddly enough they reminded me of Esme Cordelia Hoggett in 'Babe: Pig in the City', kicking ass and rescuing the farm. A lot of people criticized Miller actually for leaving Father Hoggett on the farm to be rescued by his wife -- I think it showed the 'feminist' streak that manifested in this movie and lead to even wider criticism of Miller. I'm pretty sure from where he's sitting, with this film raking in dough around the world, he's not too concerned with what a bunch of so-called 'men's rights activists' think about the film. He's a subversive guy, and for the most part he knows how to challenge our preconceptions and our expectations just enough to leave everybody happy. The mixture of craziness, sentiment, and thematic force are just about right here.",6,2,12,29 May 2015
Shark Tale," Nice to look at, pretty much inconsequential
","The first thing to say about this film is that although many of the jokes are 'in' references that kids could never understand (like 'Shrek'), kids seem to love the movie anyway (like 'Shrek'). A lot of good voice talent was assembled for this movie; I don't think the plot was terribly original or even important to the appeal of the film. Mostly it is just fun to look at; CGI works really well for the underwater setting. The film is fast-paced enough to keep you going to the end. It's doubtful that very many kids will grow up to consider this one of their cherished films of childhood. But its success at the box office pretty much ensures either sequels or more films like this.",5,3,7,15 November 2004
The Birds," fun movie
","It's possible that none of Hitchcock's movies have inspired so much passionate debate as this late-career entry in the animal horror genre. You have everything in the spectrum from those who believe that it's a subtle psycho-sexual allegory to those who believe that it's a ridiculously stupid movie about birds attacking people. I'd have to place myself somewhere in the middle of that debate, although at one point in time I'd have fallen more into the latter camp.What I like about the movie is Hitchcock's wicked dark humor. The whole scene in the restaurant, beginning with this ludicrous conversation about birds attacking children and ending with the offended woman screaming 'YOU'RE EVIL!' at the leading lady, is just incredibly funny to me. There's of course the guy in the corner who keeps saying, 'It's the end of the world' at the worst possible moments. It's a fantastic scene that includes the film's most stirring action sequence (an exploding gas station, the heroine attacked in a phone booth) as a sort of main course in the midst of the black comedy.The film does have problems in my opinion. The leading lady and leading man, Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor, might as well be made of cardboard for all their ability to emote. They have no chemistry and the Howard Hawks-ish way they are introduced is almost patronizing to the audience. Jessica Tandy is much stronger as the clinging mother. The sequences with Suzanne Pleschette and Hedren, indeed most of the scenes in the first half of the movie, are tedious. The effects were laughable the day they were released, because Hitchcock overuses rear projection and shows quite a bit too much of the bird attacks for them to remain plausible.On the whole however, I'm more positive about this film than I was when I first watched it all the way through a decade ago. I think that the film works very well as a sort of dark comedy about how seriously we take ourselves. I like the fact that the cause of the bird attacks is never explained. It never descends into that sort of literalism that people like Steven King who were obviously inspired by this film tend to succumb to. But that really doesn't mean that the film is an allegory. I would prefer to think of the film as being on the level. I think all the stuff about the main character's mother complex and his budding romance with the Hedren character are basically given a lot of emphasis so that we can easily see how trivial it all is in the face of a massive bird attack. It's precisely the unexplained nature of the phenomenon that makes it so compelling. If you were to say that a giant radioactive cloud had infected these birds, the movie would lose all of its power. To me, the movie works on some level because there is such a strong disconnect between the 'drama' going on with the characters and the horrific events with the birds. To try to draw these distinct threads of the movie too close together through symbolism actually undermines the essential strength of the film in my opinion.Maybe that was Hitchcock's goal, I really can't say. We want so hard to understand the cause of the bird attacks, to somehow make it match up or fit with the human drama, that we can create these connections ourselves. In doing so however, we're no more sophisticated nor any less laughable than the hysterical mother who accuses Tippi Hedren of being evil, who stretches so far to find the cause of the attacks herself.",8,1,3,1 November 2009
The Wizard of Oz," Classic fantasy/musical
","All-time classic family fantasy film with hundreds of midgets dancing to a Harburg/Arlen score and a smart story with an earthy moral -- there's no place like home (but who wouldn't want to visit a place like Oz?). Garland creates a classic characterization, sings with real emotion, and despite playing a bit too peppy, pulls it off in the end.   She's well-supported by a cast of vaudeville legends, including dancer Ray Bolger, comedian Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley and Frank Morgan.The photography is amazingly vivid, offset to good effect by the sepia-toned b & w sequences at the film's beginning and end.  Director Fleming once again shows he's one of the best in the world.A few notes on the film:  As many know, Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the tin man (after having exchanged the part of the scarecrow with the more popular Bolger), and I think he would have made an excellent tin man. Jack Haley does a good job, but his style of comedy is very dry, and I think Ebsen had a better brand of physical comedy, plus he was a very good dancer (anyone who's seen him do his somewhat robotic shuffle can easily imagine him in the part).A lot of people have commented on the combination of rock band Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'The Wizard of Oz.'  After trying this several times (in order to do it for oneself, simply begin the CD at the moment the MGM lion roars for the third time), I have become convinced that Pink Floyd did in fact time some of the musical effects with the visuals of the movie. There are numerous instances of this that will be immediately noticeable, but I particularly like the ringing bells on the album which are timed along with Margaret Hamilton's appearance on a bicycle!For fans of midget movies -- and I'm a big fan myself -- this is one of the all-time delights.  There are hundreds of midgets, they get their own theme song, and are showcased in some of the film's most stupendous moments. Having met a few of these little people myself at conventions, I have to say that I doubt the veracity of stories concerning their 'riotous' behavior at local hotels, but then everybody WAS a bit younger way back then, so you never know!A technical note on the DVD -- I thought the quality of the production was excellent, the colors were perfect -- I've had problems with other WB discs which look like second rate laserdisc transfers, but they really put some effort into 'The Wizard of Oz' and it shows.... also features fabulous deleted dance scene with Ray Bolger.",10,6,9,8 November 2002
The Martian," solid entertainment but nothing really exceptional
","The audience wasn't bored despite the running time, and Matt Damon does a really good job of holding everybody in just the right amount of tension, but the whole thing is too calculated and manipulative and, like most of Ridley Scott's output, looks like an advertisement. In this case, it's a big propaganda advertisement for the American and Chinese space programs and for various corporations that get prominent screen space -- who wants to bet me that the big 'Forever 21' logo that looms over half the screen towards the film's climax looks just as stupid as the the bit TDK neon sign at the end of 'Blade Runner'?It was one of those movies I walked out of with a good feeling, but the bad taste spreads the longer that it sits in my stomach. It's almost too cute, how Matt Damon's character makes these witty statements every 10 minutes or so, and the disco music and all of it. 'I will survive!' The world is sure ready to put a lot of effort into saving a single white man sitting on some damn planet he has no business being on in the first place. He even brags about being the first colonizer! This movie will really be hilarious to watch in 2040, I'm telling you!But it wasn't too bad to watch in 2015 with a nice date and a good crowd of people either. Hard to hate it, but impossible for me to love it. Every time I was hoping for a good idea, it delivered sentiment or sardonic wit. At first I was into the way the movie raised intelligence and science up as virtues. But when Matt Damon gets up at the end to deliver a soliloquy about how science can deliver human beings from any problem..... you have to wonder why we can't spend some small part of the energy that we would spend to bring an astronaut home from Mars to, I dunno, save a child from slavery in a mine or a textile factory in the 'third world.' And, yeah, I'm pretty sure Matt Damon wonders the same thing.",6,5,10,17 October 2015
From Here to Eternity," Great traditional melodrama fun
","Solid story, script, photography, and acting in a melodramatic tale set around the time of Pearl Harbor in 1941.  The guys are in the army, with Lancaster at his best as a no-nonsense sergeant in love with his Captain's wife (Kerr, who also shines).  Clift is also lovestruck, but with a 'nice' prostitute with an assumed name who refuses to marry a soldier.  Clift's suffering and Kerr and Lancaster's sad doomed love affair (condemned to die by the production code, if nothing else) make for a compelling film -- Sinatra's bit which won him an Oscar is overrated, as he overacts ferociously.",8,3,6,10 October 2002
Atonement," one of the best films of recent years
","This is a remarkably audacious and original film experience. Playing with typical 'period' set pieces and devices before descending into what could only be described as a post-modern hell, it deliberately angers and frustrates the audience by not only with-holding vital information but by offering false information and later cynically dashing viewers' hopes by grabbing them back. Such an effort could be ruined by general confusion and mis-placed intentions if the entire film wasn't so thoroughly polemical and even critical of its primary characters. In the end, the film titled 'Atonement' seems in some sense to be about the impossibility of such a glowing emotion, and the film's purpose seems to be to tantalize the audience with the possibility of redemption and peace while perpetually dangling it out of reach like the proverbial carrot in front of the mule.The basic plot setup is as heartbreaking as it is simple -- a young girl of privilege named Briony (Saoirse Ronan) mis-interprets and mis-represents events which she has witnessed in order to frame a young charge of her father's estate (James McAvoy) with a rape which he clearly did not commit. His lover, Briony's sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) is left with an abiding bitterness towards her sister and her entire family for their class-based complicity in the frame-up. Robbie (McAvoy) enlists in the army to get out of prison, leading to a separation that tears the lovers' lives apart and leaves Briony (played in the middle section by Romola Garai and in the final portion by Vanessa Redgrave) without any outlet for her growing regret and self-loathing.What's really profound about the film, in my opinion, is the fact that even Briony's relatively mature need for 'atonement' is a form of self-indulgence. She can't live with herself anymore -- but why should Cecilia or Robbie care about that? What could she actually offer them, to make up for so much that she has taken away? As the film gradually reveals through flashbacks that even at the tender age of 13 Briony's motivations were confused by sexual jealousy, our sympathy for her character dissipates even as our sense of the overall tragedy deepens. The audience is driven further and further from sympathy with Briony, and yet we cannot for a moment doubt the sincerity of her desire to set her wrongs to right. It is the impossibility of this atonement, more than the lovers' sad fate, that really forms the heart of the tragedy. Even in the final portions of the film with Redgrave playing an elderly Briony who has now sought to give the lovers some form of atonement by giving them an artificial 'happy ending' through her semi-autobiography of the events, we are subtly led by the writers and the director to realize that she has still never atoned for the evil that she did. None of this is by way of making Briony an inhuman or an uncaring person -- tragedy in its high and classical sense requires not simply sadness but the impossible longing for a higher character than we can achieve as humans. Briony did the best that she could at all times, but it was never enough to erase a decision that had already been made and whose consequences had already been felt.The performances by McAvoy, Knightley, and Garai are particularly effective and memorable. There is never a moment where the actors and actresses put themselves above the material. The director's style is at times a bit showy, particularly in the Dunkirk beach sequences, but these scenes are so gorgeous and effective that any consciousness of the film process must be overcome by the sheer power of the images. There are a few scenes that seemed un-necessary or ill-placed to me, especially a sequence with McAvoy discovering slaughtered children in a field. But McAvoy's performance in that scene is so powerful that once again I'm inclined to overlook any kind of misplaced emphasis and to simply admit that what works can't be fixed. This is the rarest kind of great film -- a film that leaves us with a truly profound sadness, a sadness that is only enhanced by the beauty and grace of the proceedings. To think that we as human beings can reach so far, and grasp so little.",9,1,2,8 June 2009
The Island," Pretty good
","This was my first experience with Michael Bay, since none of his previous movies really seemed to be my type of thing. He's sort of a punching bag for critics isn't he? It's like his name is now synonymous with bloated action films that have no feeling or depth. But I really enjoyed this one... maybe the fact that it was one of his less successful films is actually a good sign, who knows? It's basically a dystopian sci-fi -- it's obvious that the situation at the beginning of the film cannot continue and that there will be surprises or revelations, so the film earns whatever points it gets by the way it accomplishes the revelation. I very much liked that scene, with Michael Clarke Duncan's huge frame exploding through the lab where doctors are attempting to carve him up for organ donors. It's like the skit in Monty Python's 'Meaning of Life' except it's serious -- live organ donors. I find the idea plausible in and of itself so that lends weight to the horror of this possible future. I think if this technology was available people really would take advantage of it because it's true that everyone wants to live forever.Ewan McGregor is always a lot of fun and adds a lot of class to this movie. Scarlett Johansson can't act to save her life but at least she looks good in a jumpsuit. Steve Buscemi was very fun in the early scenes, I laughed when he had to tell Johansson's character not to wear the kinky nurse outfit as a disguise. I really enjoyed Ethan Phillips in his role too, very endearing. Sean Bean is a much better villain here than he was in 'National Treasure.' In the end the big effects scenes become a little too much. The character reversal for Djimon Hounsou's character was too predictable. You're not allowed to have a black villain these days, everybody knows that. But the photography in the very last scene was very stirring. I didn't care for the music in general. So I wouldn't say this was a great movie, but it was a very solid sci-fi film with some good ideas and some great action scenes.",7,0,2,21 June 2008
