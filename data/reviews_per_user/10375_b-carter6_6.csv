Casablanca," A Classic and Deservedly So
","The famous movie which gave us such memorable lines, such as, 'Here's Looking at You, Kid.' This is the movie my grandparents always exclaimed over and finally 'fangirled' in their own way when I told them I had finally watched it. This is the story of a man who started out as a relatively happy person as an American living in Paris. He then, like in most movies, finds a pretty girl whom he comes to adore. But her secret past ends up coming into play and he finds himself alone on the train station leaving France to Morocco. Now, years later, he owns a bar and seems very stand-off-ish and more somber than when he was at France. With the arrival of a certain someone at his bar, the audience gets to enjoy the entertaining plot and story, interwoven with flashbacks.",8,0,2,11 March 2015
Citizen Kane," Amazing
","Lets face it: they had us at 'Rosebud.' Citizen Kane begins simply enough with an overview of the complicated life of Charles Foster Kane. As the movie progresses the viewers are join the shadow-faced reporter, Thompson and go more in depth into Kane's life through multiple interviews, trying to find the hidden meaning or message of Kane's last words, Rosebud. This great film brings together good acting and believable conversations. With an exciting story and many characters to follow as more and more things get complex in hi life. This film is wonderfully filmed. The high point to me is the character of Thompson. You, the viewer, rarely see his face fully, whether he has his back o the audience or because the light is barely shown on his face, leaving it covered in shadows.",9,1,3,12 March 2015
Annie Hall," Eh
","When I told my grandfather that I would be watching this movie, he blatantly told me how much he disliked Woody Allen and his work. I didn't know much about Allen or his works, and I still really don't. But I liked this movie. It wasn't bad. I liked the frequent fourth wall breaks and sometimes different formats, such as the interactive flashback scenes. Most of the things I didn't like were some of the opinions expressed by Woody Allen's character. I was often confused also by the two main characters' relationship. Overall, I laughed quite a bit and liked many a scene. I ended up questioning why my grandfather didn't really like his works.",7,0,2,13 May 2015
The Graduate," Very Good
","In many ways, I related to Dustin Hoffman's character. Laid back, not entirely sure on what to do with his life, Hoffman's character starts a purely physical relationship with his father's business partner's wife. Soon he starts going out with her daughter and things get heated. I liked the film and Dustin Hoffman's acting performance was probably my favorite part of it. One cannot leave out Anne Bancroft's acting as the sexy femme fatale-like Mrs. Robinson.he really works the character and makes the viewer infatuated with her yet hate her guts at the same time. Even still I found it easy to dislike certain characters because of the way movie characters very rarely know the main character's agenda.",8,0,0,13 May 2015
Pulp Fiction," Crazy all the way through
","Quentin Tarantino really knows how to make a good movie. Intertwined movies are often my favorite and this movie is a prime example. Gathering a star studded cast, Pulp Fiction is focused on two hit men, a mob boss's wife and a boxer, none of which are explicitly connected. I like this movie and clearly a lot of other people do too because it's currently at the number five spot on IMDb's Top 250. That's got to be a good sign. Like many other Tarantino films, I loved the soundtrack. I also liked the dark humor that Tarantino would come to be known for later in his films. The characters are also a shining point in the film, my favorite being Jimmy, the short used character played by Tarantino himself.",9,0,1,13 May 2015
Psycho," An American Classic
","I remember when I first saw this the ending really got me by surprise. Now, looking back on it, I notice the smaller details Hitchcock put into this film. I, specifically, liked the comparison between the color of Janet Leigh's character's underwear. Int the beginning of the movie, her underwear was black. After she decided to give back the money h had stolen, her underwear is white to symbolize her repenting her crimes. Overall the movie is very good. My favorite part of the whole movie is Anthony Perkins' acting. It's excellently creepy which s good to set up an overall feel for the infamous Bates Motel. Another very good part is the movie's twist ending. One could argue that it's the predecessor for all future plot twists.",9,1,2,12 May 2015
