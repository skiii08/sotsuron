The Devil's Advocate," For watching, it is a good film.
","The Devil's Advocate is one of the best films in the history of cinema. Both players and cues make the film charming. When you watch the film, you can't understand how it finishes since it progresses fluently. When people decide wrong decisions and choices, it is too late for turning back. This film dealt with them very well. Also, actors and actress have a impact on watching the film with integrating the roles of their.Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are leading roles. The film explains life of a successful lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves ) that his life changes after he meets rich businessman John Milton (Al Pacino). Kevin is an ambitious lawyer, his only aim is to succeed in his career and he saves them from even they are guilty. Kevin meets John and moves to New York. He affects from him but essentially, he makes an agreement with devil. In the beginning, everything is better. But after that, his wife faces to psychological problems. So, lawyer notices some realities and he tries to change something. I like cues of film so much. Especially, 'Vanity is definitely my favorite sin.' I think, the film doesn't lose ıt's beauty even the years passes.",10,2,2,21 December 2012
