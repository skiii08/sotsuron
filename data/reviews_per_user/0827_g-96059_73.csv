Your Name.," great
","Touching love story. With a knot to wear the story of constant search, forget, recall, save the hearts of 'important people, can't forget the people, don't want to forget the people.' What's neat about taki and mitsuha in the film is that in the first half of the story, there's no dating, no gift-giving, no hand-holding, nothing like the usual love story, and nothing too obtuse.",9,0,0,2 May 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," great
","World war ii and the nazis are woven into the story around a lost ark of the testimony -- the magaffin that Lucas believes in (because it all falls apart at the end of the film). The elements of adventure, humor, special effects and horror make the film as attractive as it is to the audience. In particular, Jones, the seemingly weak hero, has repeatedly saved the day with his wit and courage, which makes it a charming halo. Jones topped americans' list of 20th century movie heroes, but so did Harris ford's performance and charisma.",8,1,2,21 April 2020

Se7en," GREAT
","This is a film with a strong religious color, see the title, think of a similar 'seventh seal'. If bergman asks about the roots of faith and the existence of god in 'the seventh seal,' then 'seven' shows what the world would be like if it lost faith.The film just seems to show that human nature is corrupted and the guilty will be punished. In this way, the film has a warning message of moral exhortation, so that people may reflect on whether they are guilty or not. However, the film doesn't seem to give a clear explanation of what makes these people evil, what makes the killers unbearable and what makes them kill in the name of god. It could be a lack of faith.",8,0,1,3 April 2020

Memento," great
","Memento's flashbacks are far more extreme than traditional flashbacks. The opening scene is the equivalent of a normal movie finale: the protagonist shoots the bad guy, but all the shots are shot backwards, such as the falling glasses flying back to the face of the person shot, the pistol jumping off the ground back to the hand of the protagonist, the bullet retracting into the gun chamber, etc. Of course, this technique cannot be applied to the whole film, otherwise who can understand the sound like tape rewind. The film goes back from this refreshing opening scene, paragraph by paragraph, about five minutes at a time, with one or two of the same scenes at the beginning of the first and the end of the second, so that the audience can tie a knot in their heads.",8,0,0,21 April 2020

The Great Dictator," great
","Premiered in 1940, it was a scathing satire on nazism and adolf Hitler. The climax comes at the end of the film, when he overtly calls for a political confrontation with fascism.
What makes the film special is that it was released at a time before the United States entered world war ii, when it was still on good terms with Nazi Germany. Before the panic over nazism had fully broken out, Chaplin's work was shocking and condemned Hitler, fascism, militarism and nazism. 'Robots have only mechanical minds and mechanical minds,' he says at the end of the film. (Machine men, with Machine minds and Machine hearts.) The film was Chaplin's first sound film and one of his best box office hits.",8,0,0,22 April 2020
The Prestige," great
","Before the birth of movies, magic was probably the most magical entertainment in human society. However, the emergence of movies means that human vision has entered a more magical era. From this perspective, movies are undoubtedly another kind of magic. The prestige organically integrates the traditional entertainment of 'magic' into the film, and allows the magic show to continuously drive the story forward. There is magic in the film, and beyond the magic is the film. The twin brother, the copy person and so on have the element of magical colour to also be mixed in among them, true true false, false true true, fell into a kind of inarticulate and inarticulate but meaningful ending finally in. Magic is deceptive, the movie is creating illusion, but in this unpredictable illusion, we can feel the infinite reality.",8,1,1,16 April 2020

Alien," great
","Alien never tries to satisfy all the expectations of its audience. It just awakens the fear that lurks in you.
It did, and in the process of doing so, create a whole new era of science fiction and, in turn, a far-reaching cultural trend. The 'space truck driver' design concept led by it was followed by several subsequent works, which almost became the design paradigm of science fiction movies at that time.

Interstellar," Great
","This story is a true story of father and daughter through time and space. Although the theme of 'love through time and space' has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy online novels, this film can make people cry, because it is so pure and true, and our lives are so similar. Cooper did not embrace 'my journey is the stars and the sea' lingyun ambition, just want to finish the task as soon as possible back to her daughter to accompany her growth.

The Godfather: Part II," Perfect
","Compared with the godfather, the godfather II is as beautiful as porcelain. This refinement is mainly reflected in the form. One of the forms is that the architecture of the story is larger, and the time and space that spans, especially the times, is more complicated than that described in the previous episodes,Different from the coherent time in 'Godfather', 'Godfather II' contains two different eras. This large span breaks through the limitations of the individual and the times, creating a sense of destiny that is endless and repeated, and the fate of the characters is placed. Under the big times. It is the grand narrative necessary for the epic; in the narrative technique, the story develops from a single-line narrative to a two-line parallel narrative,The fate of the characters is placed under the great era, which is the essential grand narrative of the epic; in the narrative technique, the story from a single-line narrative into a two-line parallel narrative, telling the two generations of godfather ups and downs of the fate of the road, this approach has a formal sense of rigorous symmetry.

The Shining," great
","The shining in the movie means completely silent communication, which is a special skill. In my view, the shining is actually an ability of several main characters in the film to foretell danger, which can be shown in advance through the nightmare subconscious. For example, in the film, Danny enters another world and redrum keeps talking in his mouth. In the subsequent shots, the mother is awakened, and what she sees in the mirror is the opposite mueder. It was also a sign that something was happening in Danny's dream while he was unconscious.

American Beauty," great
","Sam mendes impressed me with his talent. Every character in the movie, no matter how many scenes, is portrayed as flesh and blood, telling a lot of stories in a radial space centered on a street. This film has been positioned as the description of 'midlife crisis', but I also saw the 'adolescent crisis', 'character crisis', 'communication crisis', 'plain crisis', 'crisis of trust'... Is it 'the beauty of America' or 'the crisis of America'? And this 'crisis' society is not just in the United States. Countless themselves and others, countless deja vu of the past and repeat the past of the future.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," great
","As a 1991 film, I think there is no other adjective except perfect. Even in today's theaters, this film can still be a classic. As a story told through the medium of film, this film does so well that it cannot even be described by images. It delivers an intense, tightly paced, compelling story through a well-developed setting, excellent performances by the actors, and the limits of the special effects available at the time. The audience felt despair when they stood up after each attack on terminator T1000, reflected on the increasing humanity of T800, and felt the kinship between the protagonist and his mother. Everything seems to be conveyed to the audience through the screen, making the whole story to obtain the tension and real, more can get the shock and feeling, such a film, is a success, but also difficult to surpass later generations, just because of this, it can be said that it is a classic.",8,0,0,11 April 2020

The Usual Suspects," great
","The film is characterized by the use of parallel montage techniques with two main lines at the same time. One is the investigation of the case in reality, including David's interrogation of the lame man kint in the police station, the memories and portraits of the survivors in the hospital, and the other is the 'context' of what kint confessed. The most controversial is the 'context' of Mr Gent's account. Some think it is all false and all made up by Mr Gent. Others think it is mostly true, except that he compiled the names.
In fact, this movie is very interesting, and we can also see the director's efforts and the actors' acting skills. The first time I watched it, I paid more attention to the development of the story and the guess of the murderer, while the second time I watched it, I appreciated the performance of the actors and the director's skills. At the beginning of the film, a vague dialogue between a suspected behind-the-scenes boss and keaton, who asks him 'what time is it? Does anyone care when they die? At the end of the film, you will find that the lame kint gets his things back before he walks out of the police station. 'a gold lighter and a gold watch' are both seen in the scene at the beginning of the film. What follows is a close-up of the lame man's walking leg, which becomes a good leg as he walks, and the film is almost over.",8,0,1,9 April 2020

Saving Private Ryan," great
","War films are not always bloody and brutal. Before 'saving private Ryan', spielberg's masterpiece, many war films were largely reserved about the brutality of war. We really don't just use our eyes when we look at the best war movies.Saving private Ryan (1998) : one of the bloodiest and most successful films of world war ii, it follows soldiers as they search for an only child behind enemy lines.

Self-righteous profundity is everywhere.
In fact, the film, which is based on a true story, tells the story of jewish pianist spelman's persecution by the nazis.
This is an objective, calm, non-ideological film.
The irony of the story, however, is that it is a 1:1 ratio of selfishness.

He did bear the pressure and pain that outsiders could not understand. As he put it, he could 'retire' after he had completed this mission, not to achieve his own goals and make himself happy, but to help maintain the order of the universe and his healthy development.

Django Unchained," great
","Django Unchained is not a classic in the usual humane sense, as in the case of meryl streep or spielberg. It's bloody and violent, but it's a lot less violent than Pulp Fiction. In addition to the previous temporary suspension of the storm, let us think about the taste and scale of the general administration of power.

Then, as the war progressed, the Nazi massacre of Jews aroused his inner conscience. He spent all his money to protect the lives of 1.1 thousand Jews on his own.I think the whole idea of the work, the idea that Spielberg is trying to convey to us, is condensed in this sentence. Schindler saved thousands of Jews and kept them alive. For us, he not only saved these people, but also saved the light in our hearts, just as he kept a little faint light in the dark war era.",9,0,1,25 March 2020

In this novel overall structure, every story in 'pulp fiction' is told coherently. What's neat about pulp fiction's narrative structure is that it overturns the conventional notion of linear time and space without losing a large audience by being too experimental.
In pulp fiction, violence often goes hand in hand with black humor, and black humor can be surprising and unimaginable, but what makes pulp fiction unique is that it depicts the Christian faith.

And I feel sorry for him. He finally gave up his dream. Life may be like this, you can't get all you want, you will be forced to accept a lot of constraints. He was a hero who chose to stand up for others. Off the track, the harvest is a completely different landscape. Which one is better? No one knows.

The shift from buddhist 'incoherence' to Catholic guilt is the biggest change in the theme of the original work, which makes the Chinese translation all the more inappropriate.

","The film as a whole is relatively sunny. What I didn't expect was that in prison, the relationship between the sheriff and the prisoner was still relatively harmonious. Then I also saw that the man who grows tall and mighty is actually not fierce and evil, and can be very gentle and kind..",9,0,0,22 March 2020
The Lion King," great
","The decade from 1989 to 1999, known as Disney's 'Renaissance,' not only saw the company come out of its box office slump, but also, more importantly, revived Disney's understanding that animated films were not just for children, but for adults as well. The lion king, released in 1994, was arguably Disney's most serious work. Stripped of its lighthearted comedy, and stripped of its musical flourishes, 'the lion king' at its core is an old, serious storyline. Roger Ebert, a film critic, even called it 'too cruel for young children'.What makes a classic a classic is to a large extent that the story patterns of these classics are consistent with the development of human history as well as with human nature. In turn, these classics have shaped people's expectations through word of mouth: people are used to ending stories in which good triumphs over evil, the princess meets the prince, the prince regains the throne... History has become a classic in this countless retelling and adaptation, exaggeration and imagination. In fact, throughout the history of film, those most sought after by the audience, often have such a well-known classic story model as the basis.",9,0,0,10 April 2020
Inception," Great
","The logical relationship has always been clear, and while looking at it, I'm impressed that this is not generally the ability to build. Layer upon layer, grand and complex and clear regulations. So much so that when you walk out of the theater and look around, there is a sense of film shooting in your eyes. The doubt about whether it is a dream or a real one seems to be brought to your mind along with the film. If one's ability to build can be as strong as this, really, how can one accept the bondage of reality?",8,2,2,31 March 2020
WALL·E," great
","There are so many warm and touching scenes, wall-e and eve flying through the air, wall-e holding her hand waiting for the sun to rise, wall-e hiding all kinds of junk in his house, wall-e dancing to the music, wall-e awkwardly saying his name to eve, etc. A lot of beauty that can't be expressed in words really shows up in these details.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Great movie
","After watching this film, I think good faith is important. When others don't believe him, he still doesn't give in. Still have a good yearning for life. Do what you want to be, such as the title of the film also redeem the people around him",9,0,0,17 March 2020
Parasite," Great
","Parasites and hosts, inferior migrants and upper classes, masters and helpers, basements and mansions, south and north Korea. Parasites are always contained and marginalized, and hospitality and hostility go hand in hand. Binary opposition, there is always a third party in it. Third party intrusion and interference, resulting in the old sequence collapse, system reset, balance collapse, course deviation. < / p > < p > Kim family while the host left home, carnival feast, before the housekeeper wen light to ring, interrupt the party.

Paths of Glory," great
","'The path of glory' is a film that makes the fear of facing death real. There is a scene about cockroaches. Paris sees the cockroach crawling across the table and says, 'tomorrow it will be closer to my wife and children than I am to them. Tomorrow it will be alive and I will be dead.' Here's ferol slapping the dead cockroach and saying, 'now you're better than him.' The three soldiers who were about to be executed were superior to the cockroach only because they had more 'power' than the cockroach and could decide whether it lived or died. In other words, they are now only slightly superior to cockroaches in power and status, and in the army, their lives are forever controlled by others. So presumably they are no different from cockroaches in the face of death.",7,0,0,23 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Great
","The horror movie genre has historically exalted the objectification of women. In slasher movies, teen exploitation flicks, and even seemingly innocuous thrillers, women are cast for the purposes of screaming and disrobing. The antithesis within the horror/thriller genre is the 1991 Academy Award winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Although not thought of as a 'women's movie,' a feminist undercurrent is present in the film through its protagonist, a strong female character who contradicts previous genre stereotypes. Her scenes impart an objection to the objectification of women and depict the difficulty of working in a male-domintated institution. Furthermore, her character's success in the movie is her own doing; there are no male rescuers or helpers.",8,0,0,5 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," great
","At the beginning of the dark knight, Nolan even dropped the title of the movie 'batman', and abandoned the people's imagination and impression of the character. By the end of the dark knight, Gordon gave him a new understanding:

Rear Window," great
","We often see people in Hitchcock films who have a tendency to peep or to reflect the world through the lens of a peep. The rear window is a classic that takes Hitchcock's idiosyncrasy to its extreme. In the film, Hitchcock shows us the nature of the film. Film puts our peepers from the start point of view, namely the leg injured photographer Jeff's point of view, in Hitchcock's view, everyone has a voyeurism, the protagonist in the movie and the rest of us, but he is from the scene to watch the scenes of the eyes, and we can see through the hero's view is, not it is a microcosm of the world.",7,1,1,19 April 2020

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Great
","This is a Hollywood sci-fi film that really shines. Multi-line narration, special effects blasting, character contradiction shaping, father and son fighting, love, inspirational and so on are not the original film, the film is more to learn from the wisdom of the film workers in a film, make the film wonderful and good-looking, and even affect the development of the film is the most desirable place.

Goodfellas," great

From the hero's childhood film he became the atmosphere until the final death, and then the film is to use the method of narration to narrate the protagonist's inner feelings and treatment of the story happened in the film. Halfway through the film, we can definitely appreciate the slightly different Angle of the film.",8,0,0,1 April 2020
Princess Mononoke," great
","Many people think that the film's main idea is peace or environmental protection, showing the profound contradiction between nature and human beings. But I don't see it that way. To explore the main idea of a work, it is best to start from the content of the work itself; The theme of princess mononoke lies in the film's lines. The real theme of princess mononoke is to explore the meaning of life, as its main character ashitaka has repeatedly shouted: 'live.'
Although in various behind-the-scenes documentary hayao miyazaki stressed several times, he will not deliberately in the creative process to cater to the tastes of the audience or use a common story, every one of his works are like to 'behind closed doors, go out to match the' this sentence for example, conforms to the people in the story of several thousand years experience summed up in the traditional rhythm.
