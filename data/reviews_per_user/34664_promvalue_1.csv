The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Stupidest movie ever conceived
","There was nothing to watch. I don't know how you can sell a movie by doing some close up shots of Jennifer Lawrence in leather tights. It was just plain stupidity in every scene. Same old revenge drama with half side shaved heads, war torn buildings and desperate attempts to sell its viewers the idea that its a master class. At least should have shown some respect to the book from which its taken. This movie should be shown at some fashion shows during couture week may be it can get some applause there. The movie was so boring that gradually the whole theater started booing and and walking out of there shaking their heads.",1,36,57,12 January 2015
