The Legend of Bagger Vance," Boooooooooring
","SPOILERS ALL OVER ITRobert Redford has helped cinema by creating the Sundance festival and supporting talented filmmakers. I strongly encourage anyone telling him that he's already done enough.The movie's argument deals with the internal dilemma of an ex-golfer and war coward who has 'lost his swing', both in golf and in life, and who is helped by a misterious black caddy named Bagger Vance who gives him a strong piece on advice on how to grab a club, both literally and metaforically speaking again.The metaphore in the movie is poor and reiterative. The funny touches are really un-funny and so 'I've seen these a million times'. In fact, I've seen absolutely everything in this movie a million times before, and better done. Add to that a conventional storytelling and about one hundred 'unbelieveable swing-- everyone stares, the crowd yells, John Williams-like music sounds while Matt Damon smiles stupidly' scenes.And about Matt Damon. He's not really that hell of an actor. I strongly think he's overrated, although he's not bad. Will Smith is not an actor. And Charlize Theron, although she's good, can't hold a movie by herself. Although if you have to find a reason to see this movie, it must be Theron's body. Don't waste 120 minutes of your time, please.SAY NO MORE",Null,3,6,17 November 2002
Vertigo," My favourite film
","SPOILERS ALL OVER ITWhen I'm asked what my favourite film is, I often say 'Vertigo'. I don't know if it's true; it's a way out of a question that I'm unable to answer without quoting an enormous amount of films that mark me as a film buff and as a wannabe filmmaker. But the truth is that it is a movie that hooked me deep inside and that I can watch over and over again. Sometimes I want to pay atention to little details of lightning, camera movement and things like that, but I am always carried away in the end by the story and the characters.I think it can be considered Hitchcock's most personal film (and he was often embarassed about it and didn't want it to be shown). It's a thriller, but at the same time it's a dramatic story about the delusion of love and a psychological study on manly desire.I've always prefered James Stewart to Cary Grant in Hitchcock's movies. With Grant you can always look forward to see a lot of humor, but Stewart's characters are more interesting and his interpretations superior by all means. This one I think it's his best work ever. Novak is amazingly sensual as Madeleine/Judy, the woman that haunts Stewart in his dreams.And speaking about dreams, don't miss the dream sequence in the middle of the movie. The animations are senile but it's so well done that it's impressing even for today's audience.There's a lot more I could say but although it's a movie often analyzed by critics I find that it's much better to just watch it without warnings. Take your chances in the amazing world of 'Vertigo'.A masterpiece.SAY NO MORE",Null,2,3,27 December 2002
Antz," Very good animation film
","SPOILERS ALL OVER ITThe best animated film that ever came out of DreamWorks completely beats its competence 'A bug's life' by Disney in almost every aspect. Funny story, very good one-liners (some taken from Woody Allen films -'I was going to include you in my erotical fantasies' from a deleted sketch of 'Everything you always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask'; 'Trouble is my middle name' from 'Manhattan') and great voices not only by Woody, also by Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez and John Mahoney from 'Frasier'.The jokes related to marxism and comunist sistems, although smart, might not be understood by very young children. Not a flaw of the filmmakers because the movie is oriented to +10 I think.About the animation (I've just re-watched the film) it HAS got a little old, but it still holds up OK.We have something that it's rare to see in an animated superproduction: good story (typical but good), intelligent jokes, good characters, insprated direction. Go and watch it, it's worth it.SAY NO MORE",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Pure gold
","SPOILERS ALL OVER ITMonty Python's 'Life of Brian' is one of the funniest (and smartest) comedies ever. It deals with the story of Brian Cohen, a jewish man, contemporary of Jesus Christ who, when he discovers the fact that his father was a roman, joins a group of roman-haters who are trying to bring down the empire. While he's trying to do this he's captured and gets confused with the Messiah and crucified.It can be watched a hundred times you'll always find a new joke. What seems to be pure nonsense in some parts is instead a quite significant joke. And, of course, there's also pure nonsense (the sci-fi part).Although it's a parody of the classic epic Rome movies, it's not built as a parody. It's actually a well-done epic movie turned into a savage joke. Some parts put your sense of humor in trial. Are you capable of laughing at Ben the Prisoner, or at the Jewish Suicide Squad? Python's message is: do it!'Life of Brian' is, for me, a cult movie and its teachings are my only religion.SAY NO MORE",Null,0,2,24 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Dreadful movie
","SPOILERS ALL OVER ITSeriously, how can anyone with at least one brain cell can say that this is a masterpiece? And how can anyone call Peter Jackson a genius? You want masterpieces, there are plenty of them out there... Vertigo, Barton Fink, from more recent years Gosford Park, almost all of Kubrick's filmography, Chinatown, Rosemary's baby, Otto e mezzo...First of all I didn't walk in the cinema expecting a masterpiece like the ones mentioned above. I like a lot the Tolkien novels and I wanted to see a good adaptation. Having not liked the first one I thought I could spend an entertaining time watching excelent special effects. The film was so bad I couldn't even do that.First of all, does any of the five (five!) screenwriters know what the word 'adaptation' means? It's imposible to be faithful to such a long and detailed novel. You have to remember you're making cinema for people who didn't read the book and write a screenplay of your own and direct a movie of your own. That's the whole point, not just taking scenes from a book and shoot them as they are.Second, the jokes. Gimli's one of my favorite characters. Why turn him into an idiotic buffon? Maybe because Jackson and his crew don't have a sense of humor? Gimli's jokes are pathetic and you want to strangle the guy sometimes. What a way of spoiling a good character.Third, the direction style sucks. It has no epic notions, no drama... A lot of the scenes are completely spoiled because of Jackson's idiotic focus on the special effects, completely forgetting the means he has at his hands to make as scene exciting. This p***es me off- a guy is given such a high budget and completely spoils it. The reason? Lack of talent.Finally the dream sequence with Arwen. Jackson is such a lousy filmmaker that he doesn't realize that he's shooting the dream in the same style as the rest of the scenes. This is a movie wich must be filled with an wonderful, magic atmosphere. Something that is from the beginning out of reality. How to make a dream in this context? It's an interesting question. But Jackson's answer is plain pathetic.SAY NO MORE",Null,0,0,21 January 2003
The Untouchables," Very good movie after the first 30 minutes
","At the beginning, the film is kinda dull, really. Just the story of four good guys with very simple personalities that fight this famous gangster of the 20's. As I love gangster stories, I enjoy the atmosphere of this first part, but it's just too dull.After that, a really interesting aspect of the movie appears. After the death of a friend, the battle must continue. And there's a conflict between the theory and the methods of this treasure man.Some scenes are just amazingly strong, like the one in the roof with Nitti and the scene in the train station with the baby.",Null,1,2,24 December 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," GREAT
","This movie is great. I think I've never been so nervous with a movie as I was while watching the 'don't get too close to the glass' scene. The entire movie is spectacular, well-directed, well-acted... It's the best movie I've got the chance to see in a loooong while...Now, serious, in Argentina the title is translated as 'The silence of the innocents'. ???? I think they didn't get the lamb part :-P",Null,0,0,29 December 2001
