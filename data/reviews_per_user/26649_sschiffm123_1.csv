Skyfall," Dreadful
","Save a few action scenes this Bond movie is tedious and banal. No character development, poor pacing, and no real story to tell. Who directs a film like this anyway? I was all excited to see this film but I guess that's just good movie PR. The reality is Skyfall is a disaster. It's disjointed. I think someone had a few scenes in mind then worked backwards piecing together the plot. The result is terrible. Do not rush out to see this movie. In fact, I would not recommend wasting your time watching it on home video either. Even the writers must have been bored with it because they borrowed scenes from other movies. Do you remember Hannibal locked up in a clear circular cell surrounded by guards? Well the villain here is caught and put in the same cell. And yes he escapes too but this time he doesn't eat the guards on the way out. No explanation of how he escapes but then most scenes have no explanation. I hope Daniel Craig was paid well for this film. A few more like this and he can hang up his acting career. Overall a waste of time and money. Don't let it be yours as well.",2,16,34,13 November 2012
