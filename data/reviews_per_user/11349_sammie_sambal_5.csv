Blade Runner 2049," Perfect, and yet not for everyone
","I feel sorry for the people going in to this after having seen the trailer and thinking they were going to see an action movie starring Ryan Gosling.Sure it's lengthy and drawn out but if you're in to sci-fi and you don't have the attention span of a toddler you will love this movie, dare I say even more so than the original.The cinematography is simply amazing and probably the best way to experience it is to just relax and let yourself 'sink' in it. The bigger the screen (read: IMAX) the better.",9,2,8,19 October 2017
The Expendables," The Expendable
","I expected better of this reunion film of action stars. Especially the little me inside of me who fantasized of this 18 years ago. I didn't expect a deep story with unforeseen plot twists and dialogs that really makes you think, with a film like this you want to see bigger than big explosions and blood, bullets and limbs flying all over the place. And that's what you certainly get with this one. But that doesn't mean all else can be totally neglected. I mean, my little brother who's 8 could have wrote this if he could write. The story is far from interesting, the characters are as shallow as shallow can be, the script together with the dialogs make eyebrows raise and elbows shrug and the acting overall is awful at times. Most of them still really try hard to get something out of their part, like Ludgren, but fail because of bad script writing, with on the other hand people who shouldn't have gotten so many lines in the first place, like Jet Li. And then there is Stallone himself, the one looking like Michael Jackson on steroids. The guy is such a character of himself now, it's ridicules. It even made me laugh on occasion. And in the end he is to blame for all this. No,this was not the movie i dreamt about when i was young, for most part that is. Schwarzenegger and Willis couldn't even give more than just cameos and Jean Claude van Damme wasn't even in it at all (which was his own fault) so in the end this was a big fail for me. In other words, keep Mr. Stallone far away from pen and paper.",4,5,11,7 November 2010
The Town," A disappointment
","Like the title already says, i was disappointed with 'The Town'. I expected more. No wait, i expected better.To keep it short, i liked the action and chase sequences, they are excellent, and also the whole idea of Charlestown being a rat's nest of bank-robbers since the early nineteenth century, i liked that little fact , but what i didn't like was the dodgy plot and the obvious non-believable crush between Ben's character and that of the 'victim'. I mean come on, he looks like he's a troublemaker and she's kind of the sweet shy girl and after one lame and short conversation at a laundrette they are totally in to each other. It didn't feel 'real' and it was just awkward at times. But hey, that's what you get when you put Ben Affleck and a love story together.So in the end i had kind of a mixed feeling with this movie. I wanted to like it because of the whole theme and the car chases with the shoot-outs but i was held back by a plot that just didn't feel right.It's unbelievable too that so many people praise it with 9's and 10's, as if they've never seen Heat or any other proper 'heist' movie.",6,0,3,31 January 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A high on calories brain snack
","Impossible to get in to if you are expecting anything as intriguing as the Bourne movies or even the first installment of this long going franchise. Though enjoyable if you switch of the better part of your brain for the duration of it.The action is solid and keeps coming in by the truck loads, the characters are entertaining , and there's enough eye candy to keep the boys smiling.All in all MI4 (let's just call it for what it is) is everything you should expect from a big budget action movie. It's a full on roller-coaster ride that only gives you a few instances to catch your breath or think for that matter.If you want something with more substance give the Bourne trilogy another go.",6,4,8,5 January 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A step back from the first one
","This movie was like seeing myself at the age of 6 playing in the sandbox with my transformer toys and my little sister who keeps trying to bug in with her Barbie's acting out childish romantic escapades. Nothing wrong with big explosions and robots beating the crap out of each other, I still get a kick out of that, but I'm twenty five now-a-days and I like to see a good story with interesting characters and a good script to boot it all up now too. This movie lacks that. It's a shame too because the first movie was pretty good. Sure, I didn't like the fact that the original transformation sound was only used once and was absent from that point out in both movies, and also that you can't really see what kind of vehicle a transformer is after he is transformed with the millions of parts shifting in all directions during transformation. But overall it was a good movie in itself. The acting was fine, the build up was exciting and the storyline was good too. Revenge of the Fallen on the other hand does the the complete opposite. The first part of the movie consist mostly of bad acting between people with an even worse script and the second half of the movie is action packed with metal flying everywhere. Nothing wrong with that last part, like I said before, but it's not really that versatile. In many occasions it was just a little to much. It really seemed it was more important to make the explosions even bigger just like the robots and put in more chaos than put time in a good storyline, better characters and a good script. But hey, it's Michael Bay so you shouldn't be that surprised. It's just that I hoped it would be as good as the first movie, and it was definitely not.",5,2,7,18 April 2010
