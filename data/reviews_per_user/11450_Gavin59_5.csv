Raiders of the Lost Ark," Instant Hollywood Legend
","This was the most popular film in the summer of 1981, and played to packed audiences. It must have resonated with people's emotions as an action film unlike many others. It starts with an adventure - an explorer travels to a savage society in order to steal their wealth (for scientific knowledge of course). He fails when another adventurer expropriates his winnings, but survives to return to his teaching job at a university. The film shows him traveling in a flying Clipper from the 1930s, but not on a railroad. It is a good action film, as long as you don't question some of the scenes. Could Nazi Germany have military forces in 1936 Egypt? Could German Schmeisser sub-machine guns be found in 1936 Nepal? I don't believe so. I suspect these scenes were copied from the 1940 serials that entertained moviegoers. 'Indiana Jones' will entertain you as an action adventure story with a multitude of clich√©s from long-forgotten films. Sliding under the truck recalls Yakima Canute's famous stunt. Some scenes seem far-fetched to me (when you think about it). Could Indiana Jones on a horse overtake a convoy of trucks? The theme music came from the 1948 film 'Don Juan' starring Errol Flynn (rarely seen on TV). The chase through the maze of streets reminds me of 1940 cartoons. Other scenes may be derived from other old movies (the truck knocking down scaffolding from 'Abbot & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops'). A few sequels were made, but it failed to be translated into a television series. Just like 'Jaws'.",9,0,1,21 September 2008
Minority Report," The Eyes have it!
","'Minority Report' is a glossy, glimmery, gossamer, ultimately empty little flick: use it as a pretty screen saver on your 65' Plasma HDTV while you're waiting to watch a better film. It's the cinematic equivalent of Japanese food: looks nice, smells nice, goes down easy, and 15 minutes later you'll be hungry again. There is, however, a slight catch. Like uber-Filmmeister Steven Spielberg's other mega-flop 'A.I.', 'Minority Report' has already been done better, faster, smarter, and wiser: see 'Blade Runner' for the soul-crushing dilemma of whether it's moral to use a machine to do things no human would do, or even 'Kafka' for an incisive study into the guts of a society that would judge a victim guilty before a crime even occurs. So why give this pretty, shiny, happy, but empty movie even two stars? Because it has a singularly impressive, very nasty sick joke, played (best of all) on Tom Cruise. At one point in the flick, Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise) goes to a black-market eyeball surgeon for a little much-needed wetware transplant. I love Peter Stormare: I usually relish his insanity, and in 'Minority Report' he's in top form. That alone earns the flick gets one star. One extra star goes for the rotten ham sandwich in the refrigerator. Dr. Eddie leaves some milk and a fresh sandwich for his patient when he ultimately comes to his senses, then scoots: Cruise wakes up hours later, mostly blind, and staggers to the fridge for a little late night snack. Unfortunately for Cruise, Dr. Eddie isn't a very tidy housekeeper. See, there's a bottle of curdled milk and a rotten ham sandwich (evidently intended for an earlier patient), in close proximity to the fresh stuff. Moral: before eating the unidentified and sight-unseen ham sandwich in the underground surgeon's refrigerator, always do a smell-test. Where were we? Ah yes: the soul-crushing ethical dilemma is the new Department of Pre-Crime with its Amazing Young Men (and Woman) in their Psycho-tropic Fluid Machine, who can aid law enforcement in tracking down crime before it actually occurs! Call John Ashcroft! But wait a minute-you're not here to spend two hours wrestling with a soul-crushing moral and ethical dilemma concerning civil rights and free will, are you? Naw, man-you're here to see Tom Cruise and high-tech shiny things! And in that department 'Minority Report' fulfills in spades. It's what would happen if 'Crate & Barrel' had a movie for a twin sister. Tom Cruise does is spot-on in his one-note role as the obsessive Pre-Crime honcho Jon Anderton, and fingers those psych-profiles like a pro. Samantha Morton (Agatha) is spot-on in her one-note role as the pool-bound female psy-op, and proves girls just wanna have fun. Colin Farrel (Detective Witwer) is spot-on in his one-note role as the obsessive detective. Max Von Sydow (Director Burgess) is spot-on in his one-note role as the cackling founder of Pre-Crime with a deep dark secret (and a ridiculous plot twist). Neal McDonough (Officer Fletcher), as usual, gets no respect in his role as a tough-as-nails soldier, but does get a wild ride up to the top of the city with Tom Cruise, which is more than most can say. The futuristic Lexus Mark-12 is spot-on in its one-note role as the futuristic Lexus Mark-12. Again, it looks really pretty on a high-end plasma TV, and it's got Pete Stormare and a rotten ham-sandwich. You could do worse with your two hours. JSG",4,4,6,10 September 2009
Rocky IV," Rocky (USA) vs. Ivan Drago (USSR)
","In this third sequel to the 1976 original 'Rocky', Sylvester Stallone continues the story of America's greatest boxer. After beating Apollo Creed in 'Rocky II', then Clubber Lang in 'Rocky III', Rocky is going to have the greatest fight of his life. This time he is representing the United States as he goes against the USSR's top boxer, Ivan Drago, a 6'4' boxer who has a punch of 2000 PSI. The story starts out of course with the end to the last fight against Clubber Lang where Rocky regains the title that is rightfully his. Now Rocky lives in a huge mansion with Adrian and his son, Rocky Jr. He has cars, money, and lives a luxury. Then one day, new arrival from Russia, Ivan Drago comes to American to enter professional boxing. Drago wants a exhibition match with Rocky. But Apollo Creed wants a piece of the man first. So the first fight is Creed vs. Drago. The results of this fight are not good. So Rocky decides to go after Drago and fight him in Russia. Adrian is convinced herself that Rocky can't win against this man. Rocky and Paulie go to Russia alone out in the middle of nowhere to train with Apollo's old trainer, Tony. The training scenes in this movie are great as the scenes flip back and forth showing each fighter's training techniques. Drago is training in a high-tech facility while Rocky is training in the deep snows of Russia by chopping wood in one swing, pulling sleds on his hands and kness, and running up mountains in the snow. Rocky now is ready for the fight of his life. He is not only fighting for himself but for the pride of his country. Will the United States win again? Buy this DVD and see what a fighter Rocky really is. This sequel has it all. Great fighting scenes, great plot, great character development and is overall a great sequel to the Rocky collection.",8,0,1,10 September 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's Eleven
","One's attention is immediately drawn to this movie for its many famous stars such as George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. It is a bit odd storyline from the beginning that Daniel Ocean, played by George Clooney, risked robbing the casino for love and revenge. However, I liked how they planned the whole thing out carefully and how the movie proceeded speedy. I liked the part when Rusty, played by Brad Pitt, calls Terry Benedict, played by Andy Garcia, and tells him that they are robbing his casino. And yet, Benedict wasn't able to get anything, neither the money nor his woman. Also, I liked how it let Tess, played by Julia Roberts, know Benedict preferred money to her. I thought it would have been better if the casino heist weren't so perfectly planned and that there were some critical moments or tensions. Though I now know there is a sequel of this movie, 'Ocean's Twelve', when I first watched this movie I predicted that there would be another one. Because at the end two of Benedict's staffs follow where Ocean and Rusty were going. All-in-all this was a hilarious and well-acted movie overall.",8,0,2,1 October 2008
Pretty Woman," Pretty Woman
","Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition) has to be considered one of the most classical,romantic comedies made throughout the years. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are excellent actors together and without them I don't believe the movie would have been the same. This classic 'fairy tale' movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest. This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie. Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there. The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never-before-seen scenes, deleted scenes, and commentary. The deleted scenes are also a must watch, they are just simply hilarious, and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies, but who also likes added comedy as well. Pretty Woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made.",9,0,1,2 October 2008
