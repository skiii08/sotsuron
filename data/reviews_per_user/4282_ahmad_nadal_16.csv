Deepwater Horizon," Don't Expect Some Plot Twists or a Disaster Thrilling Movie
","When you decide to watch this movie, you are going to watch a movie that discusses what lead a disaster to happen. You are watching the how the human being react to this and how he will deal with what is going on around him, not some twists and thrilling. We can safely say there is no thrilling in the movie.The master of this peace is Peter Berg who I really like his work in this movie, I Liked his way in picturing the mechanism of the machines which will get you really confused as your are supposed to be. He make some amazing scenes by connecting the characters together where there emotions combine.I am going to talk about Mark Wahlberg who I was really impressed for especially in the last few scenes which he did in an Academic way, I was totally impressed. I can't also forget Kurt Russell who did one of his best roles this year after being amazing last year in 'The Hateful Eight'.The screenplay writer chose not put any twists or fake events in the story to respect what really happened and I totally respect that.My rating is 7.5/10",8,0,0,13 January 2017
Lone Survivor," Emotional , Stressful & Political
","I have expressed a very emotional couple of hours with a lot of stress. The movie show you what an American soldier go through during his duty. The ending of the story isn't a mystery, it's obvious from the movie name and also from the beginning scene, the enjoyment of the movie is what really happened not how it ends.Peter Berg managed to make us really feel what did the four soldier suffered in their mission, in late June 2005. You will even feel been inside from what happened to them. His picture was respectful and done well.I have to talk about Mark Wahlberg who proves to me in every movie that he is a great actor with great talent.I enjoyed my time watching this epic mission and feeling sorry from my deep heart.My rating is 8.5/10/",9,0,1,14 January 2017
Passengers," It Could Have Been Better
","Passengers is a movie I enjoyed watching it with narrowing my mind and neglecting the mistakes which weren't few.I liked some things in the movie like how the ship was designed the idea of the whole movie but I hated how it was made. you feel so many time, it is not real, not in the sci-fiction side but in the mind and realistic side, it could have been better.But we can't deny that there was some amazing scenes, in which the graphics were fabulous, but when I think about them again i feel like they could have been much better, because the main idea is great but the doing isn't that good.Can't say that Morten Tyldum have failed but I hoped he had done better because he could have.Both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt had few scenes to show the acting capability and they both succeeded but not for an award. Didn't like Michael Sheen and didn't know if I liked Laurence Fishburne or not.But overall it is a nice movie with which I enjoyed my time in the cinema and my rating is 6.5/10",7,5,12,26 December 2016
Troy," You Will End This Movie Cursing The Stupidity
","With no reasonable reason this movie become one of my favorite, I don't actually Know why but I loved it. Maybe it's because the amazing acting by Brad Pitt and how he really made me love Achilles or because of the amazing fighting scenes specially those of Achilles or maybe because of how much I hated Paris which was played by Orlando Bloom or because of the amount of stupidity the really bothered me, I actually don't know.Wolfgang Petersen ,the German director, did an acceptable work in this movie with few mistakes that I am not going to talk about because they aren't of much importance. David Benioff wrote one of his best screenplays and made me love and hate Achilles at the same time.The whole acting team were amazing except Orlando Bloom which didn't give his best and I think I hated him because of how the character was written not because of his acting.After all I really loved it and enjoyed the whole 3 hours.",8,0,0,14 January 2017
Spotlight," Trust No One
","First of all, This movie is one of 2015 TOP movies and one of the best movies concerned with The Press work. Talking about very sensitive subject for the American community and was a real shock for most of the world which child molestation by some Priest and the Church's tries to cover this up.The movie was very interesting and introduced the subject in a very thrilling way in a subject that may seem 'how would they make a great movie from that?' and the credit for that returns to the writers of this masterpiece.During this movie you will feel disgusted and fooled many times and you wish you weren't born in this world. How on earth this is happening !! But this is our world and we have to face it, we are here so face it. Enjoy the movie, Enjoy your life but just don't shut up and make yourself blind because it could have been you or your child, that's what this movie is saying to us.I loved the movie a lot and my rating is 9/10.",9,2,3,19 January 2017
The Hateful Eight," Quentin Tarantino as always
","Not Tarantino's Best work but still epic and very very bloody. He made the movie with only 17 characters, 8 are main as obvious, one is important as side character and the rest are not of big importance. Every one of the 9 character was written in the best details with a chance to rise.Most of people will say that Samuel L. Jackson was the best in the movie but in my opinion it is Walton Goggins, he was really funny and unexpected which made me enjoyed him the best.We can't forget the music which was tremendous but I blame Tarantino for not using it more, it only appeared in very few scene.I enjoyed the movie and my rating is 8.5/10",9,1,4,5 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Not That Bad
","My luck is that I watched the movie without high expectations not as most of people did, and it wasn't really that bad as everyone saying.But I have to say that David Ayer failed to make a great film, he didn't even do anything unique or special ,not a single thing, and all the mistakes in the film are one his behave as he is the director and also the writer of the screenplay (alone).I also watched the Blur-ray extended version not the cinema's version, and I didn't find montage mistakes as I heard so I think they were managed in the Blu-ray version.the film begins with bad introduction to the team members except for Deadshot and Harley Quinn there introductions were so good for me.The presence of Batman in the movie was tremendous and was managed really good.Jared Leto's Joker wasn't definitely better than Heath Ledger's but I still loved it, it's The Joker and he is Jared Leto after all.I have to raise my hat to will smith and Margot Robbie for there acting and taking there characters to a new level, they may be the only good thing in this film besides Batman.The villain was really really really bad, with a very bad acting and horrible effects and without a clear goal or even a reason and that's what make the whole film meaningless to certain degree.I loved Rick flag by Joel Kinnaman and didn't love Amanda Waller by Viola Davis that much.so after all it isn't that bad but it's that good either . so my rating is 6.5/10",6,2,3,19 December 2016
Doctor Strange," Also a marvel type movie and still Great
","Doctor Strange tried to get out of marvel's normal style but still failed. But overall it is a really great movie. Benedict Cumberbatch is literally a super hero in actor, he just nailed it by all measures.And how we can just watch a movie where Mads Mikkelsen is the villain and say it's a bad movie. it has to to be tremendous.I was really really impressed by the visual effects, it felt like I was watching Inception and I really loved it.Scott Derrickson's directing style cannot be found in this movie unfortunately.Has to see. 8.5/10",9,1,2,18 December 2016
Drive," That's How You Do Movies
","If you do appreciate a well-done movie, great acting, awesome cinematography & a very Compatible sound track, you have to see this movie. If you do love car chases and some action scenes, you will find them in here but that's not what the movie is made for. In this masterpiece you will find Action, Romance & awesome drama. You will obligated to got emotional to some characters in this movie, which show you how well it is written.They have a great cast, it was enough for me to know that Ryan Gosling and Bryan Cranston are in this movie to hurry to watch it and Gosling had really given the performance of his life and Cranston made us feel really sorry for him. Everyone in this cast was great even the child.Don't expect to watch something like or close to transporter, you are going to watch a highly tense, dramatic, bloody masterpiece.My rating is 9/10.",9,2,3,6 February 2017
Room," Good Bye Jack
","Every Thing is normal because it is familiar to you not because it is normal. Do you wanna understand what this means?! Just GO and see the is masterpiece.A very emotional experience that deserves all of our respect. You wouldn't even Know what is the best thing in the movie, Is it the acting, Is it the emotion? Is it the screenplay ? Is it Jack ?! I think it's definitely Room.You are about to watch a new respectable talent of a 9 years old boy Jacob Tremblay who had shown me the best performance by a young actor I have ever seen, and we cannot forget our academy award winner Brie Larson who definitely deserved every award she got.This movie deserves every minute of your time.",9,0,3,18 January 2017
La La Land," It's not What you really think
","It's not the kind of musical movies that you used which are full of dancing and good music. Of course you are going to experience one of the best musical movies ever but that's not the main movie. It's highly dramatic with highly realistic message 'Here's to the fools who dream'.Damien Chazelle had just nailed it in this movie after he nailed it in 'Whiplash' which is one of my top favorite movies, but actually I loved 'Whiplash' more, of course the cinematic view of 'La La Land' is much much better, but Whiplash was a really special case for me and I couldn't have that in 'La La Land'. He definitely deserves an academy award nomination at least this year.Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone were so so blended and I really loved them. Emma stone was dramatically better than Gosling and did much better but overall they were both great. If they will get any nomination, I think only Emma Stone deserves it.I hoped J.K. Simmons had a bigger role but he was just a guest that we love.A Definitely great experience and I highly recommend watching. My rating is 9/10",9,3,7,4 January 2017
Whiplash," One of the best movies I have ever seen
","you should be shocked when you find out that this is only the second movie for a 30-year-old guy. then you become assured that he is the future of Hollywood and also the future of musical movies which has been always dead.Damien Chazelle made the best musical movie ever with only $3,300,000 budget. I think he deserved an Oscar nomination but it's his first masterpiece so it's not a shock for me.J.K. Simmons the actor who rises in his 60th and does the role of his life and totally deserved the Oscar. When you first hear that Miles Teller is the main character you think that it's a miscasting but he totally nailed it and proved that he is a really good actor.And I have to talk about the film editing and sound mixing which were epic and blended us with the movie and the music.My rating is 10/10.",10,2,5,5 January 2017
Casino Royale," A Great Start for A New James Bond
","I Probably have watched the best James Bond so far. had lust nailed it, of course with the help of Eva Green who was the perfect love for a perfect agent. We cannot forget about Mads Mikkelsen who always makes the best villein.Martin Campbell have taken James Bond movies to a whole new level of drama and action. he found the best in Daniel Craig who is a modest actor in my opinion and took some amazing scenes specially that one under the water.I found some problems with story in the first half of the movie which was a little boring for me and I got annoyed with the many villeins but the second part was very satisfying for me and I had a great time watching it.MY rating is 8/10.",8,1,5,12 January 2017
50_50," So Emotional and Also Funny
","I had so much fun enjoying this movie and I got so touched and had to Wipe my eyes at some moments. I loved seeing the story of a young fellow who is having a healthy life got a cancer from no where and without any reason that makes anyone feel that, he got this to himself, it was totally his destiny and he has nothing to do with it. what makes it more harder that it is a rare kind of tumor that is hard to be treated. So you go through his story and his relationships with his family, friend, girlfriend & his therapist.All the actors were so great, starting from his father which had only one scene to express his feelings and it totally touched me, and his mother who loves him but in the way that all mums do and we don't like it, to his friend which is played by Seth Rogen who has really great in this role and I loved him a lot, and I will neglect his girlfriend because I just hated her which by the way means that (Bryce Dallas Howard ) did it right. To Anna Kendrick as his therapist which hasn't become a doctor yet.Everything was just great about this movie, I highly recommend it, My rating is 9/10",9,0,0,3 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson is Back & Andrew Garfield Rises
","One of the best Dramatic Emotional movie this year (2016) if not the best. Mel Gibson comes back with a hell of a story and presented it to us in the best possible way with small budged compared with the great scenes he did and that is a great credit for him which proves that he is a great director.I love to talk at first about Hugo Weaving which was tremendous and Vince Vaughn was great . Andrew Garfield did his best role so far in his career with a really great potentials. We also shouldn't forget Sam Worthington who was also unexpectedly good.By watching this movie you are watching a master piece that was about to reach 'Saving Private Ryan' and did a truly respectable try.And 'Please god, help me get one more' My rating is 9.5/10",9,3,6,4 January 2017
Draft Day," Very Entertaining
","I actually barley Know a thing about The American Football and it was difficult for me to get what is happening at first but nearly to the end I understand it totally. The movie will but you in what really happens during The Draft Day with a lot of excitement and expecting.It's fun to watch it at the end for calm day while you are resting and eating some snacks and don't want to tire your mind with a heavy movie, It's simply an interesting light movie.Kevin Costner was great as always but I really didn't felt him as guy who still in a new relation ship with Jennifer Garner who is more than 10 years younger than him but it's OK, It's Kevin Costner after all.",7,0,1,15 January 2017
