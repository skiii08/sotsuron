Alien 3," A big disappointment
","After the two first hits Alien and Aliens, the standard should be very clearing. The film lacks imagination and is not the least innovative in its effects. This is the Alien movies 'Last Jedi' but is still better than 'Last Jedi'. The end is so bad that it would have been better to be waterboarded! Still it is one of the Alien movies and need to be watched in an Alien marathon!",5,0,0,19 October 2019
The Lion King," The magic is gone!
","This is an example of that Disney needs to bring in the money that Ryan Johnson lost them on 'The last Jedi'. The original Lion king movie always bring me to tears and then to joy. It is an emtional journey. This movie just made me empty inside. Mu eleven years old who grew up with the animated version and loved it called this a 'Nature documentary'. he said 'Dad, this was more for you grown ups'.",2,56,87,18 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Exellent movie, stunning effects,but dishonours star wars!
","The movie in istself is fantastic but when you follow up on the original characters like Luke, Leia and Han you have to do it honourable. This is where JJ totally blew it. Leia's character gave a week impression and killing of han without Luke and Leia's pressence was thin, very thin! And when it comes to Luke Skywalker WTF! His entrence in the movie should have been when the lightsaber was shaking in the snow. The lightsaber should have gone into luke's hand, what an entrence it would have been. Instead we only got to see him for a few seconds in the end, WTF! Besides that I loved the new characters even though Kathleen Kennedy's political correctness had aa very uncomfartable pressence in the movie. This movie would have made it to 10 in MY rating if it weren't for the listed failures.",6,0,6,3 May 2018
