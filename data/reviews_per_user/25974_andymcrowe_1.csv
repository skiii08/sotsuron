First Man," Don't expect Arnie or Bruce Wills
","....as some reviewers appear to. This is a marmite film; if you understand the calm, intelligent character needed to land on the moon then you will appreciate this. Neil Armstrong was such and it is a strength that Ryan Gosling presents him as such. I do not know how tense the relationship was in the marriage but if you are risking your life as the astronauts did, it is hardly surprising. But the interspersing of family life is another strength since we should know more about the Christopher Columbus of our generation. I liked the muted orchestral soundtrack; a Titanic or brash rock music soundtrack would have been out of place. And pace? Well there were many minutes when I was so engrossed by the rattling old rockets and shaky camera work that I swear I didn't breathe, such was the tension. Time flew, a sign of a good film.",8,0,3,14 October 2018
