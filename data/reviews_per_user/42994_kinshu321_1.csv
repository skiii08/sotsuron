E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Not Quite Such A Landmark
","Good Movie, but... It is the but one doesn't expect from one of the 'greatest movies of all time'. The realisation of the concept was excellent and the camera work better still. I speak from only a limited experience and do not have a formal understanding of how it all works, but the way the scenes shifted and the placement of the cameras was quite outstanding. The emotions of Elliott was quite well drawn out, and the ET was made quite well considering the technology in the early 80s. But that's about it, the positives of the movie. The acting was very wooden, especially that of the 'scientists' who came marching like zombies wearing astronaut suits! Now which scientist will you find walking like a zombie with hands outstretched? Even the realism of the entire thing was too stretched. How can a bunch of boys run off with a high security and priority experiment specimen and then escape full eight police squads on a bikes just like that? Further there are a lot many loopholes which left a lot to be explained. Like how did the ET come back to life, and why did it die in the first place? There were way too many things which just happened, without any logic. In my opinion, a decent movie, from which Koi Mil Gaya took inspiration (and ended up being a better movie!) but definitely does NOT make it to my best movies list. Perhaps again some time later, I might appreciate some more things about this one?!! Seriously overrated, i had more expectation of Spielberg.",6,0,2,13 May 2008
