Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Call me a prude, but this was not funny
","I have to admit, that i actually laughed out loud once during this movie. The nice little touch with Borat throwing down his bag, and You hear the chicken complaining.That for me was the only real funny moment of this otherwise offensive comedy. I don't consider myself as humorless - hell I have a part-time job as a stand-up comedian - but this was simply too much and over the top for my liking. It is moderately funny when You are confronted with some of the stereotypes of America, but is has been done so much better before - Bowling for Columbine as a good example. Otherwise the movie is filled with gross scenes of extremely obese men fighting, and perfectly genuine and nice people being subjected to Sacha Baron Cohen's twisted mind. Lawsuits galore have followed this movie, and I am not surprised. Just hope, that it could cost this idiot his career.",1,15,31,17 November 2006
