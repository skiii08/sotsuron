Minority Report," Seeing the future and thus making it happen
","The great thing about this movie is that it tells us not to believe it. Even if one knows his future, you can't change it. But could prediction be self-fulfilling ? And is preventing the prediction from happening, part of the prediction ? Then what's the use fighting it?OK, this movie made me think. Sorry 'bout the intro. What is Spielberg trying to tell us. Fate exists, no need trying to escape it? You create your own fate ? These two theses cannot be true, knowing of Spielberg's commitment to the suffering of the Jews in WW2, as pointed out in Schindler's List. So, what's the third option ?<ul><li>Never trust the minority.</li></ul>or<ul><li>Even someone who is always right can be wrong, someday.</li></ul>or, my favorite,<ul><li>No system is infallable and in some cases fallable sytems kill innocent people.</li></ul>This movie has a very subtle way of making you think twice about the death penalty; can justice be cruel? How sure can anyone be about anything ?Most importantly, its a great flick. See it, enjoy it, think afterward or during the second showing......

Gangs of New York," thought i was watching the run-through
","This movie is by far the worst movie Mr. Scorsese has ever done. Don't see it if you think Casino,Goodfellas,Taxi driver, King of Comedy, etc. are good movies, You'll be disappointed. I swear. And is it just the director's fault ? Well, eventually it is of course. But some others take the blame as well. Photography is a downright example of 'lot of money, let's do it the easy way', so unlike other movies by Scorsese. The acting by Cameron Diaz is probably the worst i've seen yet in a production even 1/8th this big. The scene where she's inevitably kissing DiCaprio is acted as if it's a lines run-through. I kept wondering when Ben Stiller would pop up. Anyway, hugely overrated, under-acted, under-shot, miss directed way one hour too long campy saga. Miss it if you can, or enjoy Daniel Day Lewis while you're at it. .... (Mr. Wolf sipping his coffee)",4,2,8,21 October 2003
