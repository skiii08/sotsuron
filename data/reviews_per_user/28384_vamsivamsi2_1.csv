Iron Man 3," Nice movie. But could be better..
","In every movie, the Iron Man takes my breath away in his advancements of his suits, his weaponry, Jarvis (his A.I for his armour). But this movie makes all the others (yes.. including Avengers) look like a child's play. He upgrades the suit till Mark 42 which is like the coolest armour ever. His A.I, Jarvis also gets updated to a level that it can control the suits without any involvement of a man inside the armour. So, when it comes to the visual effects and action you get more than what you asked for.Now, coming to the story, it could have been better, especially with the Mandarin story. The twist was so lame. It seemed like they wrapped up the story too quickly and without any clear reason, tony stark simply throws his whole Iron Man life away. I know it has to end but it could have been handled better.Now, the cast. Robert Downey Jr is, as always charming and witty. His one liners have always impressed me and you could expect some of the best ones in this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce are okay. Ben Kingsley has a little role but he managed to throw a little humor in the story.Overall, this is a good movie and I will recommend this to every one. It will provide a few good laughs and some mind blowing action scenes.",7,34,69,27 April 2013
