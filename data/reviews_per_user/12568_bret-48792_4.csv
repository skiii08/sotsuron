Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar Binks? More Like... SHUTUP Binks!
","What in the hell... this movie was so boring, and dumb! There was nothing impressive or engaging about this movie! Only good thing was the race and the very meh battle with Darth Maul. This movie should be a damn sleeping pill! Just turn it on then it's lights out. The writers celarly weren't trying, the movie was for money and toys obviously. Also Jar Jar Binks is so annoying. I was hoping he died during the climax of the film. Legit everything about this movie is gross and boring.",5,1,2,22 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Outstanding! Just As Good As The Empire Strikes Back!
",Everything about this movie was great.Completely loved it!,9,0,0,22 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Awesome, But SOME Characters Aren't Interesting
","As someone who watched this film and never grew up with it or first seen it in the cinemas in 1977, it was kind of difficult to keep me engaged (I was engaged with it 90% of the time though!) I'm specifically talking about Han Solo and Obi Wan here. They were both very boring and non interesting. The most interesting characters were Leia, C3PO and R2D2. The battle with Obi Wan Kenobi And Darth Vader was not done very well.But as a story standpoint, and a movie it's enjoyable and entertaining 90% of the time which is why it's a good movie. It's just lacking some interesting characters in my opinion.Other than the whole non interesting characters thing this movie is awesome! Loved the battles and acting. Leia, C3PO and R2D2 were very entertaining. I loved the scene when Luke discovered the message. The beginning of the film was awesome too.The Empire Strikes Back did a way better job though.You should definitely watch this movie.",8,0,0,22 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This Is An Amazing Engaging Film!
","Everyhting about this film is great except two SMALL things.
<ul><li>It seemed like the movie was forcing Luke to get kidnapped and lost just so the droid could discover them.</li><li>Leia and Han angst was very strange and confusing.</li></ul>Now into the positives!
The action sequences, acting, characters, and soundtrack was basically prefection. All of the characters were very enjoyable! And all of them had a purpose and was actually useful in the story! Luke is the heart of the film as well. The climax and final battle of the film was outstanding. Darth Vader just appearing there with the other storm troopers was awesome!For sure, worth a watch.",9,0,0,22 April 2019
