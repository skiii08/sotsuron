The Blair Witch Project," Very Atmospheric
","The Blair Witch Project is one of a kind in the movie industry. You will never something quite like this in any movie store. Some people hate it or love it but never ignore it. Some sequences will just leave you on the edge of your seat but you never know what's really happening. The camera's a little bit too shaky and doesn't really shows everything to the viewer, that would've make it scarier in my opinion. The ending is well done but very brutal at the same time, it ends in an abrupt way that frightens a lot of people and I know why! If you like character development and atmosphere movies then this is for you but if you're the one that will go for Halloween, Scream and Friday the 13th this is not for you. There's no action but only good scares. You really are the witness to the long walk the students are walking toward hell and death. You'll never think of the woods as a safe place after seeing this.I highly recommend this movie but only for selected people.",9,0,2,8 May 2004
Your Name.," Immature, cringy and boring
","Let me start by stating that this film contains the most beautiful animation ever seen in a Japanese cartoon, hence the 3/10 score.That being said, cinematography can only account for so much in a movie. In this case, the rest is simply a train wreck.The movie is aimed at children aged 8-16 at most. The dialogue is a cringe-fest, characters are unbelievable and the story is boring. There is no suspense, no anticipation and no character development. The typical anime character are present here and everyone is expendable to the story, which is a mess. The intrigue is without substance and won't entice a shred of interest on behalf of the viewer. This is a rare instance where my biggest anticipation was for it to be all over. If you've seen 'Only God Forgives', expect the same kind of filmmaking: all the efforts went into the visual side of the movie. The rest is horrible. It needs a special level of immaturity to be enjoyed. Adults cannot be entertained by this.The definition of over-hyped.",3,19,68,8 April 2017
