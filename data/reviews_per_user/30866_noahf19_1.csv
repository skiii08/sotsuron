Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Long, Slow and Unispired
","Episode 1 was a huge disappointment. It lacked the plot, fast pace and likable characters of the trilogy, but most of all it lacked real purpose (other than making money) - it seemed to me that Lucas really had nothing to say.Sure, he is unrivaled in his ability to create visually stunning images and visually interesting action sequences, but these need to be a backdrop to a good story - not a substitute for one.It was also difficult to tell who the intended audience was. Children would find much of the political machinations to be dull or incomprehensible, while adults are left shaking their heads at the child-like simplicity in which adult relationships are depicted. And then there is the painfully awkward dialog - one that made the gifted cast seem as wooden as amateur players.In summary, this film should be avoided by anyone who is seeking entertainment value.",3,0,1,18 October 2005
