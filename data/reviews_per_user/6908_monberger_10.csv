Ford v Ferrari," Amazing Film!!!
","Wow! What a thrilling and a worthy for best picture nomination is this movie. The story is so thrilling, literally keeps you on the edge of your seat. Christian Bell, and Matt Damon are superb!!! Adrenaline runs through it watching it. This is the best car race movie ever. The race scenes and the sound mixing is just fantastic. Really, at the end of the movie, it makes you sigh and say 'What a ride'
It has been a great year in films and at this point not sure which movie will get the best picture of the year. For sure F Vs F is one of the best.",10,3,6,22 December 2019
First Man," It could of have been...
","It could of have been a great epic story to portray in a film. I don't know why critics keep giving Chazelle higher ratings to his films. He is a terrible director with no vision to tell a story. Watching this film bored me to no end. The characters emotionless depiction of Armstrong story. chazelle need to stick to the first genre type of film (Whiplash). Please, No musicals, No, great epic stories.
Please, No Oscars awards for this one!!!",6,3,8,16 December 2018
Rocketman," I just watched the best leading actor of 2019!!!
","A marvelous biopic/musical Rocketman! What a great film and what a performance from Taron Egerton he seriously deserves the Oscar nomination and the win. Please, do not give it to Joaquin Phoenix. Taron is superior even from last year's Rami Malek's performance. Rocketman is just a fantastic movie. The script, the music, the costuming, the acting is just great. I'll be singing Elton John for awhile. Taron Egerton is the man to beat. Rocketman is my front runner for the best picture as one of the best of 2019!!! I love this film!",10,10,15,23 December 2019
A Star Is Born," Wow, Wow, Wow!!!
","All I can say is THIS IS THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR!!! Bradley Cooper created a masterpiece! Bradley and Gaga an incredible chemistry! 
A Star is Born has been done so many times and this version finally pays a great tribute to an amazing story! So human! So real! So heartfelt!
The only spoiler I'm going to say is... Bring tissues! ❤❤❤❤",10,1,5,7 October 2018
The Irishman," The Irishman is an Epic Masterpiece!!!
","I want to say that 200 and something minutes, was purely entertaining. A movie to become of epic proportions must have a running time of at least more than 120 minutes. The Irishman running time is over 200 minutes. I know some people do not like long movies but let's be real short movies usually feel like they are missing something. they usually luck of story and character development. The Irishman exceeds all that. Magnificent art direction from Scorsese, Al Pacino is just masterful as Hoffa. The three of them Al Pacino, De Niro, Pesci are truly amazing. The last time we had an epic winning best picture was with the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. What year was that? 2003 or other epics like Gladiator or from the '90s like Titanic, Schindler's List, Dances with Wolves, The English Patient, Braveheart, etc. for sure I'm forgetting other epic films. It is about time! The Irishman Surely is an epic film. I don't think This year will be another movie to beat. The Irishman for me is the best picture of 2019. If you like this type of mob films you will love it. Give it a try.",10,9,22,16 November 2019
JFK," It should have won Best Picture!
","JFK one of the best films of the 90's. this movie should have won best picture over the silence of the lambs. I don't know why reviewers have never given credit to Costner as an actor. In this film, he has proven them wrong especially at the trial scene, his speech to the juror is mesmerizingly emotional and incredibly compelling. That is one of the best monologs I have ever watched in a film. for those younger audiences that have not seen this film. please, see it!",10,5,9,18 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Very entertaining!!!
","First of all, I was not bored at all. I enjoyed DiCaprio and Pitt as always. I love movies that reflect circa the '60s. I enjoyed the pace of the film and had a great laugh throughout the whole movie. This film has allover Tarantino's signature. The recreation of Los Angeles of 1960's/cinematography, costuming, music are great, and the end of the film is good too. But also, it seems to me that all the thing about related to Sharon Tate at the end of the film it is too familiar. It feels that was copied from a film called 'The Haunting of Sharon Tate' which personally I think was really good, but, critics and people trashed it! How come critics and people love Tarantino's film and trash the other one! Hmmm. It could have that was copied from that movie. Watch 'The Haunting of Sharon Tate' and you will be agreed with me.
Anyway, It is an interesting plot that resembles nothing at all but is Tarantino's film. Not everyone enjoys his films. I do!!!",9,1,3,22 December 2019
1917," Splendid film!!!
","I would like to start by saying...so sick of people comparing the new films with past films that they love. Stop, please. Take it as it should be, new films. If you don't like it it's alright but stop comparing.Sam Mendes did a masterful work with this simple but very emotional story. As I was watching the intensity of emotions started to fill me with incredible sorrow, sadness that I couldn't stop crying. I have seen so many movies in my life and I have cried in so many. But in 1917 film created in me an incredible uncontrollable moment of sorrow. I wanted to cry out loud. I believe, this is what is beautiful in this movie. Sam Mendes created a short story profoundly emotional. Masterful Direction, breathtaking cinematography, beautiful musical score, great acting, just love it! This movie does not need character development as many people keep saying. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.I'm just feeling wow with this year's masterful movies. My top eight:
1917
Little Women
The Irishman
Ford Vs Ferrari
Rocketman
A Hidden life
Uncut Gems
Richard Jewell
These are Amazing films!!!",10,5,8,10 January 2020
La La Land," Worst musical ever!!!
",I don't know what was all those good reviews for this garbage! This is the worst musical ever! That was ridiculous from the first scene to the last. Don't get me wrong I like Gosling and Stone but this was painful to watch. The people who gave good reviews to this...don't know if they ever watch a musical. Glad it didn't win the best picture of the year.,1,2,5,6 October 2018
The King," Chalamet is the King!
","Chalamet is genuinely and truly a great actor. Every frame, every shot of him it's a treat to watch! I wanted to watch this movie on the big screen and I'm glad I did. It was worth it! I know this movie is coming soon to Netflix. Please, go see it on the big screen, it is worth it to pay the full-price ticket, then you can watch it again on the small screen. Loved it from beginning to end. This is one of the first masterpieces that Netflix is bringing this year to the Oscars race. It is really a great film.",10,71,127,30 October 2019
