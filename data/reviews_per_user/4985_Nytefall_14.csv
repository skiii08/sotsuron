Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worthy of the Star Wars Legacy!
","Needless to say, before I walked into the theater to see this movie, I had high expectations for it.  I expected to see an excellent story with excellent special effects that would appeal to all.Without spoiling anything, I will say that it met all my expectations. The only reason why it didn't exceed my expectations was because of the lack of character development.  I feel that more could have been done in that part. The lightsabre duel was the best I have ever seen.Go see this movie!  Bring the kids!9 out of 10",9,0,0,6 July 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Dr. Jones I presume....
","I can't tell you how many times I watched this movie.  I remember when I was a kid and it was on HBO back when I was in the 5th grade.  I watched it so many times that my eyeballs fell out of my head.Recently, I rented it expecting it to be something great to watch again.  I am a huge Indy Jones fan and will always be one.  Lets hope that Indy 4 really does come out.  :)Please go see this if you haven't seen it already!10 out of 10",10,0,0,17 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Go see this!
","A truly excellent movie.  The only thing that I found as a detractor was some of the really crude parts of the movie.  However, if you have an open mind, then these things don't detract from how good the movie is.  South Park has made it this far by insulting everyone.  It doesn't matter if you are white, black, gay, straight, little, big, kid, or adult.  South Park: BLU pulls no punches.  The songs stick out in your head as well (especially the Terrance and Phillip one at the beginning)8 out of 10 rating",8,0,0,6 July 1999
Blade," Gotta love those vampires!
","Good movie with good special effects.  Wesley Snipes seemed to have a lot of room to move when it came to his part though.  Blade in the comic book series wasn't like this.  However, I did enjoy it and you will too.I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this in the theaters for the first time.  It is good enough to own on DVD I will tell you that much.Can't wait for the sequel!7 out of 10",7,0,1,8 July 1999
X-Men," Very Worthwhile Flick!
","I really can't say I am a X-Men purist.  I did collect the comic book for 6 years (starting when Bishop appeared) and stopped about 4 years ago.I really can't say that this movie was the best I have seen, because it isn't.  The special effects and storyline were both very good.  However, there is one part of this movie that could have been improved.  That is the character development.  They tried to cram a two and a half hour movie into a hour and a half and it shows.  Hugh (Wolverine) had the main part in the flick (probably because he is the most popular X-Man) and all the others had to share the time that was left.Overall though, this movie was very worthwhile to see.  I won't see it again in the theaters though, but I will probably buy it on DVD to see again.7 out of 10 stars",7,0,0,16 July 2000
We Were Soldiers," Unbelievable
","I am a huge fan of Saving Private Ryan.  We Were Soldiers brings the bar up for true war stories being told through the movie medium.  While Saving Private Ryan has to be the best war movie when it comes to being told as a fictional story, We Were Soldiers does the same thing except it is based on true events.  If you liked Saving Private Ryan, please give this movie a try.  You won't regret it.",10,2,3,12 March 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Not half bad
","I am a big Alien and Predator fan.  When I say I am a fan, I mean I liked all the movies.  Obviously, I liked Aliens and Predator the best of the franchises.  The others were still good quality entertainment.  When I heard this movie was coming out, I thought it was going to be awesome!  About two weeks before release, I heard it wasn't going to be released to the critics and I thought it would suck.  I had NO intentions of seeing it last night, however, my brother dragged me to the theater on opening night to see it.  I expected this movie to suck, however, it wasn't half bad.I never give out HUGE spoilers in my reviews, so I won't go into too much detail.  I had problems with the following things in this movie.It was made WAY too child acceptable.  The violence was toned down a lot so the movie would make more money by getting kids in the theater.  This movie would have benefited by seeing more graphic violence instead of implied violence.They didn't stick to what made the previous movies successful.  The whole premise of the movie was a little unbelievable.  Just look at the way they set the temple up for instance.  I think the story could have been a HECK of a lot better.Now, I thought the Alien and Predator fight scenes were very cool.  However, there weren't many in the movie, which turned me off a little bit.  I think this movie would have benefited from 15 more minutes of fights between the creatures.  It was a short movie anyway, so just they should have just added them in.The bottom line is if you liked the franchise movies, you MIGHT like this one.  The key is not going in with high expectations.5/10",6,0,0,14 August 2004
Schindler's List," Definetly worth seeing!
","I went out and saw this at the bargain theaters back a long time ago.  Back then, I thought it was a excellent movie, well based on the life of one man and the lives he saved.I got a chance to see it again recently and thought I might add my own comments to the mix.  I found it a very good movie, however, it was slow in places for me.  I felt myself getting real tired at some junctions in the movie.I really love movies like this though.  Liam played the part of his character very well and the plot was well defined.  I would definetly see it again, but it isn't as good as other movies I have seen.8 out of 10",8,11,19,17 July 1999
Rudy," Excellent film!
",This film is truly excellent.  Has the look and feel of a classic film of guts and determination.  I even shed more than a couple tears at the end of this film.  Go see it!  You will not be sorry!8 out of 10 stars,9,1,1,14 August 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," How did I miss this in the theaters????
","I find it hard to believe how I missed this movie in the theaters.  A friend of mine told me I should see this movie when it was taken off the new release rack.  I looked at it and just shuddered.  He had to rent the movie himself and drag me into his dorm room physically before I saw it.I can't believe how good it was.  He paused it for 10 minutes in the middle so he could answer the phone and I went nuts.  I couldn't wait to see the rest of it.I can't wait until this comes out on DVD.  Until then, I will settle for my VHS copy.  Go see this movie.  :)10 out of 10",10,0,0,7 July 1999
The Matrix," What a film!
","One of the best films I have ever seen.I will be totally honest with you.  I didn't know what to expect when I came to see this movie.  It looked interesting from the previews and movie trailers I saw.  However, it really didn't hit as being a excellent film until I saw it.  Now I can't get enough of it.The plot is one of the most interesting I have ever seen and the fight scenes are probably going to be voted as the best ever filmed.  Sure, there was a few corny parts to the movie, like the love interest they threw in. However, that does not detract from how good this movie is.If you see one movie this summer....go see the Matrix.10 out of 10",10,0,0,6 July 1999
Heat," Excellent Crime Saga!
","Probably one of my favorite crime saga stories!  Pacino and De Niro are excellent.  The story is a little long, but the character development is excellent.  Well worth owning on DVD especially.  :)9 out of 10 stars",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen!
","I remember seeing this movie when I was really young.  When it came on HBO, I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.  I have 3 copies of the Trilogy and I have not regretted purchasing them.Now go see this movie instead of reading all the user comments!10 out of 10",10,0,0,7 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best movie of the trilogy!
",Don't ask me why I liked this movie better than the others...I just did.Maybe it was the sabre battle between Darth and Luke on the skywalk.  Maybe it was Boba Fett.  Who cares....it was just terrific.An excellent movie!10 out of 10,10,0,0,17 July 1999
