Skyfall," less my expectation of a bond movie
","1. honestly, the name of 'skyfall' really threw me off as i watched the film. I really was expecting a more modern and urban setting than the movie. 2. 007 has always been about new technology, gadget, fast pace, and such, but this one actually went 'back'... i realize and understand it is the theme of this movie and i respect it in many ways, being the anniversary and all, but it is just not 'my' typical bond movie, and did not meet my expectation.3. too much hype, and not even better than the previous ones.6/10 because if this were a stand-alone movie it's quite well made; however, points were deducted because it doesn't belong with the bond series.i have to say i have no background or insight about movie production or anything, it's purely based on my feeling and the presentation of the movie i perceived... which i believe is more important than all the technical stuff.",6,10,20,12 November 2012
