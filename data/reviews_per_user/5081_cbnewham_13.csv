Insidious: Chapter 2," I have no idea what people see in this
","Why does it have a rating of 6.6?!One of the most disjoint, disorganised, confusing, plot-lacking, and quite frankly, dumb, movies I've seen in recent times.With just passable acting and a poor plot, combined with confusing switching between various houses and groups of people, I feel I wasted 100 minutes of my life.Two stars - at least the acting wasn't completely wooden.",2,0,0,29 June 2020
First Man," Awful. Plain awful.
","Have just returned from the cinema to watch a movie I was really looking forward to. I wish I had not wasted my time or money. I have no idea why it has such a high rating on here. 7.7. Really???!One of the very few films I felt like walking out on. I endured it just to see what they Moon walk would be like. Suffice to say it was very boring and very inaccurate and certainly not worth waiting for.The highlight of this film was the Gemini 8 malfunction. However, even this was wrecked by constant cutaways to the family. What could have been really gripping was totalled by bad direction and editing.Other points of note:<ul><li>what is it with EYES. Why the constant need for close-ups of faces and eyes? It just got really distracting. A gimmick that just wears thin really quickly.</li></ul><ul><li>what is it with the sound? On 'Apollo 13' I had no difficulty in understanding the dialogue. In 'First Man' I had difficulty understanding the actors even when they weren't suited up. I sometimes wondered if it was a foreign language film.</li></ul><ul><li>why was it necessary to keep ramming the 'Armstrong is a family man' down our throats all the time? It wasn't subtle and most of the time was done in a ham-fisted way that just detracted from the rest of the movie. If you want to see it done right then watch 'Apollo 13'.</li></ul><ul><li>the last scene was just creepy. It cemented my thoughts from watching this film that Armstrong was just a creep and shouldn't be left alone with women or children. Totally the opposite of what I believe he was actually like.</li></ul><ul><li>the use of incidental music was annoying and often inappropriate to the scene it was used in. Then there was almost total silence on the landing/walk when it could have done with music.</li></ul><ul><li>the astronauts were far too busy to be crying on the Moon or hanging their heads in the spacecraft as shown here. Those attempts to make them look human just fell flat.</li></ul><ul><li>inaccuracies abound. I felt like I was watching a circa-1950s vision of the lunar landscape with huge craggy cliffs and mountains rather than gently rolling hills and craters. Also, small foot-size craters don't usually all have a lump of white rock in the middle of them.</li></ul>To sum up: far too much time spent on gimmicks and implausible character situations and dialogue combined with awful sound and a plodding story with nary a dramatic moment in it.Don't waste your time. Rent 'Apollo 13' instead and watch a masterclass in how to make a good film about an Apollo mission.",2,9,15,19 October 2018
Hereditary," What a waste of a good build-up
","I went into this without having read any reviews - only the major headlines from critics saying how wonderful it was. I'm was in agreement for the first 1 hour and 50 minutes. Sadly the remainder of the film was dire.I loved the build up and suspense. It was well-acted and the dark foreboding with very few jump scares was a refreshing change from the usual standard.Then we get towards the end and the film descends into the usual standard of horror films. The revelation at the end didn't make any sense in the context of how Paul, the boy, was treated in the lead-up. It seemed as though the script writers, having done an excellent job of building up tension, suddenly realised they didn't have an ending and so cobbled one together so as to get their pay-cheque.Perhaps they should have cut the film at the flower-bed scene and saved us the big 'explanation' at the end?All in all a big disappointment.So out of 10 stars which I would have given it: 4 off for the awful ending and 2 off for the retrospective nonsensical treatment of the characters once you know what the ending is.",4,4,9,21 June 2018
Passengers," Passable but with bad science
","This movie is enjoyable enough if you ignore the massive plot holes and bad science.On that note, it's disappointing that many commentators and reviewers (and the 'goofs' section) can't get their science right either!50% light speed does NOT produce massive time dilation effects. A 120 year journey time on the ship would be 139 years on Earth (and that's assuming 50% LS for the entire trip and ignores the acceleration and deceleration at the start and end which would lower the Earth duration further to about 125 years). You can calculate this yourself - there are plenty of on-line calculators for time dilation effects.A sling-shot maneuver would not work to any great extent for 50% c.. One assumes this would be for a course correction, but why bother? You can just go straight to the destination which would be a shorter and quicker path. If it's for energy transfer (a la Voyager/Pioneer spacecraft) then that too would be minute and pointless.However, these are minor quibbles because so much other science is wrong in this movie. If you are prepared to ignore basic high-school science then the movie is enjoyable enough.",5,0,0,23 December 2018
Green Room," Original if flawed
","Overall quite good. However, it would have helped if the actors had spoken a little more clearly - half the time it's so slurred as to be unintelligible - and Patrick Stewart was completely mis-cast. If he thinks he can play someone menacing, especially a neo-nazi veteran - then he is sadly mistaken. His performance was pedestrian and certainly nowhere near the hard-man that was needed for the role.",5,0,3,20 February 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," A nice little movie
","I enjoyed it very much.My only criticism is that of the Live Aid reproduction. It may seem strange, but I find the video available on YouTube of the actual performance to be far more compelling.The movie version of the performance is accurate and technically very well done but it just seems to have no soul. I really don't think it would ever be reproducible. Some things can only be performed once.",9,2,4,30 October 2018
Justice League," Fun enough
",So long as you leave your brain at the door. Plenty of action and lots of big set pieces. The story is the usual stuff.The only complaint I had was that many of the backgrounds are obviously green screen. Poorly lit and with obvious outlines to the characters. That side of it was very poorly executed. Sometimes I felt I was watching a movie with effects from the early 1990s.,7,0,0,24 June 2020
Children of Men," Always wondered what the fuss was about
","However, now I've got around to watching it - well, half of it - I can see what a predictable cliched film this is.There's nothing new to see here. The film doesn't really seem to have a statement to make and it's just a lot of running around and being politically correct.I'm giving it 3 stars for the acting, which is reasonable if not outstanding, and 1 extra star for having a relatively accurate picture of the future - although I doubt we will ever have see-through screens (why would anyone do that, even if it was possible? Some attempts at showing future technology are really stupid).I got bored by the half-way point and bailed. I can see where it's going but I can't be bothered taking the rest of this boring journey.",4,0,5,9 July 2018
Evil Dead," Just stupid
","I watched the original, 'The Evil Dead', not long after it came out on video in the early 80s. It was low budget and, while the story was pretty basic, at least it made sense, thus:<ul><li>No-one had a choice. All events were unavoidable once the book had been read out loud.</li></ul><ul><li>The 'hero', Ash, isn't injured by an entry wound at all - he just gets lots of blood and guts dumped on him and hit by a poker. Hence he is never possessed.</li></ul><ul><li>Nobody makes any really (and I mean really) stupid decisions.</li></ul><ul><li>Nobody who is possessed can be retrieved.</li></ul>In this version all four of those rules are broken, most of them multiple times.This film goes for over-the-top gore, but in so doing it just loses any fright power it might have had. The more understated original is far more frightening.I'm giving it 3 stars - two more than it deserves - because at least they tried to make the ending somewhat different to the original.",3,1,1,5 July 2018
Saw," An interesting concept
","I've always been meaning to watch this film.I have to say that while it is an interesting concept, there are several instances where things would have had to go exactly right for Jigsaw's plan to work.On top of that is people not using guns when they were in a situation where it was shoot first ask questions later. I found that extremely annoying! And I thought America was a gun-mad place where shooting first happens frequently.Obviously not in the Saw universe...6/10 for being OK, but this movie isn't half as clever as it thinks it is.",6,2,3,13 April 2020
Limitless," A choice between
","An interesting take on an interesting idea or a shallow Hollywood mirror of the American dream.Well, in my case it didn't matter. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the ending was quite satisfying, even if a little predictable.",9,0,0,29 December 2018
The Descent," I wish I could re-write the script
","I'd remove the monsters for a start. Then I'd have the confusion of being in a cave, which they were never supposed to be in, allow all kinds of hallucinations and let the girls turn on each other as they struggle to find a way out.Instead of that we get a most illogical plot and some monstrous humans that seem to be blind, deaf, and have no ability to sense by touch (you'll know that's the case when one of them clambers over the main character). They seemingly kill for no reason - and I make that claim based on the huge number of animal bones from game which must have provided them with many large meals.The girls in this are quite ridiculous - all that screaming and rushing around (resulting in accidents). Half the time you can't even understand what they're saying. What was the point of the car accident at the beginning? It doesn't make the main character any stronger. She seems just as pathetic as the rest. It certainly doesn't have much to do with any kind of 'journey' she may be on in the rest of the film.The best part of this film was from where they enter the cave until the first sighting of one of the monsters. I think if you cut everything else off you'd have a half-decent (or is that descent) movie.",2,1,8,18 March 2018
RED," Eights stars
",Well paced action movie with some humour thrown in. Not over-the-top silly. Certainly enjoyable and well worth watching.,8,0,0,2 May 2020
