Hereditary," Horrorendous
","I've seen many horror films and this is not horror, unless you count the writing and all the things that happen as a truly tragic horror to the genre. Bloody stupid, totally unrealistic and dare I say evil. Maybe that's why some people liked it because of the evil it personified. I've seen that Linda Blair movie and that is a different evil, with some talented writing. This is what I call the bottom feeders version of horror. If you don't mind being treated like an idiot with very unrealistic scenes, hey, see it. If you prefer intelligent, well scripted scenes, go see something way way better.",3,4,8,31 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not wild about Harry
","Harry Potter is a sequence of stories beginning with Harry as a child, and then growing up.  Nevertheless, it is a kids story, and this film lacks that kid element - unless we have demented kids running around.This particular story, The Prisoner of Azkaban, sets up Potter's mid-kid crisis so to say.  He finds a friend of the family, but realises his own magical strength as a wizard.  It's one of the most important stories in the series, but this film depicts a real dark side which I would never allow my kids to see.  Columbus did a great job in the first two movies, endearing us to characters such as Weasley, Malfoy, Granger, Dumbledore, Snape, et al. This director's version made it all about Potter.  One character can be a movie, but with the talented experienced theatrical actors such as Smith, Gambon, Rickman, and Thompson - they went to waste!  Potter's father, if you read the books, was a slime bag - an arrogant man with an ego bigger than Aunt Marge.  Sirius Black was his partner in crime, so birds of a feather flock together.Albeit it's a good series of reading, the movies need to bring some compassion of the characters, which the first two did.  It'll be interesting to see how the next director does with Goblet of Fire.",6,1,2,4 June 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Drama, drama, drama....
","I loved this movie!! It reminded me of the movies I loved as a kid - with story and great acting (yes, kids, some people actually did create different story lines themselves, without re making old flicks with new actors).Spoiler: the part which the critics proclaimed 'euthanasia' is bull. There was a fantastic line in Groundhog Day, where the nurse tells Phil (Murray) 'some people just die'. Critics need to fill their propaganda files somehow, and by using a movie for their trite talk shows is unsavory. This is a movie about high end drama, with great acting by Swank, Freeman and Eastwood. Thank you Mr. Eastwood!! You are a true Hollywood creator and icon.",10,4,8,6 March 2005
Mulholland Drive," Take a test drive, it can be interesting
","This film had such great potential - a fantastic first hour!  Riveting story of a girl who forgets her past... and the characters involved were even better.  Justin Theroux is an excellent actor.  It was great seeing had Everett again, James Karen, Angelo Badalamenti, and Ann Miller!  Lynch has always been great at putting together a good crew.  There are no character flaws, just the lesbian scenes were overdone.  Once they went into Silencio, things got weird, and weirder.  The box was a very, very good concept. This is true David Lynch, but some of the scenes were a bit overboard.",6,0,1,12 April 2002
