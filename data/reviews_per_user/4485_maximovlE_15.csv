The King's Speech," Unexpectedly good.
","One of those films you're told you should watch but don't really have any interest in... But then you watch it and love it. Geoffrey Rush just elevated himself high on my list of great actors, and the relationship between himself and Colin Firth dragged me straight into the movie in a way that doesn't often happen. My only disappointment is that Geoffrey Rush didn't get the Oscar that he so deserved.",10,1,1,25 September 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," To many missing
","As wooden as Orlando Boom is, it was lacking something without him and Kiera Knightly. It was lacking even more without the excellent Mackenzie Crook! Really, as good as some of the actors here were, and Ian McShane was fantastic as always, it just didn't feel like Pirates of the Carribbean to me. It felt like a cheap copy. Jonny Depp carries it, but is better with the usual gang. Not seen 5 yet, I'm hoping the magic is back but with a better direction than 2 and 3.",5,0,0,9 January 2020
50 First Dates," Unexpected Gem
","Ok yes it's a comedy. It could have been a better romance, it could have had less penis jokes... But...I think the terrible 80s style humour actually made the real part of the movie all that much more of a suprise, and all that much more beautiful. I'm a grown man, I cried, especially at the end.Loved it.",10,1,1,25 February 2020
Hereditary," Minus 10
","Seriously, I'm insulted having to give it a score, it deserves nothing.What a waste of my life. Two great actors wasted. Why on earth did they choose this? Maybe it looked better on paper?The prolonged moments that made a 30 minute movie last 2 hours...The awful ambient sounds...The director who's never socially interacted, ever. Seriously, no one does the things these people do...Never thought I'd say this but this is the worst film I've ever watched. At least I did most of it at double speed to get it over with...",1,5,9,29 July 2019
A Star Is Born," What's wrong with people?
","So much negativity here. Are you all emotionally dead? I'm a guy who typically rocks out to Slipknot, Metallica and Maiden. I didn't think Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga would do it for me.This movie grabbed me right from the start. Completely engulfed in the movie so much so I almost peed myself because I didn't want to miss anything. Gaga is amazing. Bradley is amazing. I had no knowledge it was a remake of any sort, and glad of that because I despise when people compare. It is what it is and it's amazing.My only frustration is that the scumbag of a manager didn't get what he deserved, but I guess that's realism for you. There's a whole industry of scum out there taking talented artists and turning them into pop trash. Creating 'stars' that don't sing but perform. Making money without heart. Flashing their bodies and hiding their souls. Its a shame but thats how it is.The performances were fantastic even so, the movie definitely deserves multiple awards, and I can't see how anyone with a heart couldn't agree.",10,1,2,17 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Confused
","I rarely disagree with the bulk of IMDb reviews, but I'm completely confused with all the hate. OTT CGI? Yes, totally. But every movie since Iron Man has increased in CGI and farfetched...ness...I understand disappointment, I'm still gutted over GoT, but this? Nah not disappointed at all.It's a sit back and enjoy the ride movie, with a fantastic soundtrack. I can't wait for End Game.Oh and Brie Larson has a new fan ;)",10,8,16,7 June 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A masterpiece.
","As usual I've had a read though the other comments. One in particular stood out, calling this unbelievable and picking at all the different attractions making then all sound pervy and disgusting. Hello, where do you live? Somewhere in isolation?The Great thing about this movie is that it is absolutely believable! There's nothing here that hasn't happened in real life. I've personally been almost every character in this movie!The acting was fantastic too. Especially between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. So real.I wish I'd seen it sooner, but I know I'll see it again.",10,1,3,13 February 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," .
","I just watched this for the first time.
I want those two hours of my life back.
To watch it again for the first time.",10,2,2,21 February 2019
Aladdin," Best live one so far
","I've been hating the live action remakes. Couldn't even watch beauty and the beast thanks to the pretentious lead. Dumbo was dreadful propaganda and nothing else at all. Lion king, I'm dreading it...This film? Well, I guess you need to like Will Smith for a start, but thankfully I do. The Great and wonderful Robin Williams can never be replaced, so thankfully Will didn't try, he just did his own thing and did it well. I'd agree that at times his acting seemed awful, really awful. But I think we can put that down to CGI. He did look as out of place in some parts as Carrie Fisher does in the latest Star Wars movies.Overall, watching it with my 4 year old, who, in all honesty is more the target audience than most people complaining about the movie, we loved it. It held her interest more than any other live action, and I wasn't grabbing for my phone out of boredom. So win win.Well done Disney, you can still make them good.",10,0,3,24 August 2019
The Piano," You critics make me laugh.
","A few years too late but I've just watched this. Even to today's standards, it's an amazing movie. Actually, for today's standards even more so. I would have to presume that the plethora of 1/10 ratings come from the type that would rate transformers as an all time epic.I read one review asking how Holly Hunter won an Oscar when she didn't even talk. Really? So you think someone like Jessie eisenberg should have a collection of Oscars? Because that man talks way too much!You don't need to talk to act. Being able to communicate without speech is so much harder and Holly played it flawlessly. In my opinion Anna Paquin was just as amazing, especially considering her age. The part where she has to give something to Harvey Keitel was amazing. I have a young daughter, to be able to act that well on cue... well, she had me bawling!Ignore the negatives. If you have a heart and require more than cgi with no story.... then watch this if you haven't already.",10,6,8,30 January 2019
La La Land," Unexpected rollercoaster.
","Not the sort of movie you'd expect to be described as a rollercoaster, but that's the best way to describe my emotions watching it.Ryan and Emma are clearly talented actors, but I'm not sure they were so well cast for this. Beautiful to see singers not doing the usual screech thing that they all do these days, but still, I didn't feel they were strong enough for this.I must say, talking of sound quality, the sound on this production is awful. Absolutely awful. I own a top spec TV and no matter how I adjusted the settings parts of the dialogue are completely inaudible. I almost went with subtitles.Hollywood, and everyone else please stop allowing actors to mumble their lines, how can anyone think that's ever going to be good for the industry!?There were parts of this movie that forced me to love it, I had no choice. Especially where I was suprised with the ability of both actors. Then suddenly I was cringing at other parts.There were parts where I was glued to the screen, others where I started nodding off.Overall, at the end of the rollercoaster, I was confused. Why. Why was this movie made? What was it for? Was it retro? Was it modern? Was it comedy? Was it drama? Was it fantasy?I'm far from being an expert on musicals. Moulin Rouge I enjoyed. It was clear from the start what it was and it did it well. A star is born... Is that a musical? I dunno but it was good, it had a style, it gripped me. This? La la? I'm just not sure what I've just watched. And I definitely have no clue what the people making it had in mind. It changed direction and style so often it was as if different segments had different crew members making it.It gets a 5. Something kept me going, I just don't know what.",5,1,2,26 October 2019
Love Actually," Last Christmas
","Just watched Last Christmas. A film I wanted to like but struggled to. In the reviews I read a lot of people comparing it to this.There is no compassion.Love actually is, and always will be, perfect.One of the best selections of big names outside of the marvel franchise, one of the best Christmas movies ever, some awesome writing, and the ability to still make a grown man cry. Every year.Not seen it yet? Why on earth not???",10,0,2,30 January 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Such a disappointment
","So many people complaining about Ben Affleck. Me? I cried a little when I saw Jessie eisenberg's (can't be bothered to check if I have that correct) name come up at the beginning of the movie. Never seen a single film with him that was any good. He's awful. Simply awful. Cant blame him entirely or this one though.One and a half hours in and I'm begging for it to end. Quick check of the time remaining... oh hell I'm only half way...I'm surprised. Man of steel was ok. Wonder Woman (yes I watched out of sequence) was excellent. How does this steaming pile of boredom fit between them?Slow, boring, drawn out unnecessarily and not very well written.DC vs Marvel? No contest. Every one of Marvel's movies beat this, even Black Panther!",1,1,4,12 August 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," I feel for you readers.
","I rarely read, not because I can't, but because I rarely have time. Sometimes I'm glad of that. Today is one such time.I've only just got around to seeing the Harry Potter series, and I surprised myself how much I loved it. However, I felt that there were parts in it that just didn't make sense. As the movies progressed it seemed to happen more and more. How did they do that, how 'could' they do that, where did that person come from, who the hell is that?Now I've finished and I read these comments I start to see why. As a non reader of the books I agree with all the readers comments, the movie was incomplete.I'm so glad I didn't read the books first. I feel your disappointment. Such a shame.I still loved it. I still rate it 10. But knowing it could have been... no, SHOULD have been so much better leaves a bitter taste.I guess I need to find more time to read... After watching!",10,0,0,28 January 2019
Casino," Almost there
","Good movie but far too long. Parts added that are unnecessary and easily forgettable which lead you to doing otherwise things while watching.Maybe it's because I missed something, but is it bad that I was rooting for De Niros character throughout? I was glad he survived, even when I found out it was based on real characters.I'll probably watch again one day.",8,0,0,27 October 2019
