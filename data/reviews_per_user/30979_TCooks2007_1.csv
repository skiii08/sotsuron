It," A Disappointment
","The movie was a disappointment to me.While the special effects were good, the movie just wasn't scary, and the characters were very poorly developed. I yawned through the last third of the movie. The movie did not even seem to have the same theme as the book - belief, love, and friendship overcoming evil. This was so very one-dimensional just like the characters in it were - one dimensional. Wow! I expected more than this crap. It was flat.I loved the 1990 IT TV mini-series. It succeeded at everything this one failed at.Are we so used to quick sound bites and tweets that we can no longer have well-developed movies with substance?I will say I did like some of the nods to the old movie or book and the nostalgia of the times. They threw in a few of Stephen King's references to the times. I would say see it on some forum whether Netflix, the movies, or rental just as a flashback to the 1990 one. I think the actors were good; they just weren't given much to work with. The actress who played Beverly is strikingly beautiful.",3,24,49,8 September 2017
