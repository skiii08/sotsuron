The Blair Witch Project," The Absolute WORST Movie I've Ever Seen
","This film was a complete waste of my time! I almost fell asleep twice in the theatre and nearly walked out several times. I enjoy a good horror/thriller, but this certainly was not one. I'd heard a lot about the movie before my husband and I finally saw it and I was really excited - hoping it would live up to everything I'd heard and that it would actually be scary. HA! When the credits rolled I was still waiting to be scared. (And darn relieved that it was over!!!) The writers failed to create characters I cared about. F this and F that just doesn't cut it. It was totally stupid. And they failed to explain things at all.  The idea behind the movie was a good one, yes - but they did not succeed in this modern piece of crap. Don't waste your time, it's not worth it.",1,6,11,26 July 2000
