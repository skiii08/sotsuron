The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Hunger Games: Losing Fire (Part 1)
","Firstly, I loved the first two movies. Hunger Games was good and Catching fire was great. Now there's this... Mockingjay AKA Losing Fire. (Just a 'little' Summary)It starts off with our Mockingjay (Katniss) in hospital and then she meets President Coin, who tells her something ( I forgot, it wasn't really that important). She goes all sappy about Peeta ( Ugh) and leaves to see the ruins of District 12 (Insert burnt bodies and skulls for dramatic effect). After seeing this she suddenly agrees to be the Mockingjay (I think that's what Coin asked her, I just remembered). For the rest of the movie, she becomes a puppet for propaganda videos (Terrible actor, bad bad Katniss) and goes around showing her lovely Mockingjay face. (Insert bombs killing innocent patients and some hovercrafts being brought down by explosive arrows). District 13 is discovered, by the Capitol, and blown into pieces - not really. (Insert white roses for Katniss from Pres. Snow). More videos are made for the propaganda and... eh. You get it. (Oh the Capitol has a black out. Again, because of the bombs).Eventually, Peeta and the others are rescued, safely. (He strangles Katniss and she dies. Just kidding - she lives and finds him tied up, forcefully trying to unstrap himself).The end. (Insert Song by Lorde, which I liked)You can obviously see what was wrong here, there was a lack of action. All the action was replaced with bombs, everyone was bombing everyone. (I want the girl on fire, and well, all we see is a dying flame).This movie was okay. If you miss it, you might still enjoy Part 2. Not much is revealed apart from District 13 and the victors being saved. Oh and did I mention that almost everyone is depressed. These people have killed and survived the hunger games (Twice) but they are all just depressed... Meh. Other than that it's still a nice movie to watch, it is the ONLY movie series that's actually captivating. I feel awful about this review, but I was sitting in the cinemas, begging for it to end. (Yet the previous two movies left me wanting more.)Actual Rating: 6.5 (The bombs might have killed many people but they saved this movie.)",6,18,25,26 November 2014
Godzilla," Good Movie, missing 3D effects
","Barely jumped off my seat. I had anticipated a greater 3D Climax, however, the movie was good. The movie was cheated from opulent 3D effects, you know the ones that make you shriek and spill your favorite beverage. Those missing effects could have made this movie the best (necessary) 3D movie of the decade, thus far. Definitely not predictable (Ford's mom dies right at the beginning and then it's suddenly '15 Years later, in San Francisco'). No 'post credit additions', I was expecting it to end with one egg that 'survived' the explosion, but gladly, that was not the case. I watched the first Godzilla when I was a kid (I barely remember what happened, but I remember I didn't get bored) and this 'remake' did the original film justice. Definitely a movie to watch in 3D and on the big screen. If you do not watch this movie in 3D and at the cinemas (the big screen), you will spend a lifetime wondering what it would have been like to see the terror in enhanced visuals. (I feel the same way/regret about 'Gravity')",7,1,5,17 May 2014
