Ford v Ferrari," Ferrari 's honor
","A good movie I watched in 2020 is also the best racing and sports movie I have seen in recent years. From the very beginning of the movie, Ken's respect for the game, his understanding of the car, and his grasp of every corner, all showed the highest professional quality of the athletes. I saw the supremacy of sports in him, but it was very helpless. Sports is a game between pure capital. In the eyes of capitalists, sometimes winning or losing is not the key. The most important thing is how to use means to ensure the maximum benefit. There is no winning or losing. Only the pros and cons are completely contrary to the spirit of sports. Ken also made several psychological struggles in the car on the last lap. At such a fast speed, he still had to make a choice of thoughts. He was really helpless in tears. On the other hand, in order to compete with absolute speed, even if the vehicle is out of control, Enzo Ferrari is basically on the scene throughout the game. The Italians themselves are worthy of respect;",8,1,3,23 March 2020

Parasite," The conflicts
","On one side is a flooded room and on the other is a birthday party. On one side is the icy and hard stadium and on the other is the luxurious soft back garden. Money is an iron, which irons everything. They scour the net, live in the basement, and do whatever they can to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, they are even worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into three, six, and nine. This wall, standing in the wind, the sun and the rain, stood still. The Park couple looked stupid, but they were still getting richer and richer; the Kim Ji-zee family was clever but couldn't stand up. You thought you could get a good job, get a good salary, and get rid of your poverty status. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that is already in the blood. You climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may have just reached someone's basement. They are bugs, so they have a hard life; they are bugs, so nothing kills them.",8,0,2,17 March 2020

Marriage Story," what about Jesus 'father?
","Seeing the last wets eyes, a long, cumbersome, sometimes tearful and sometimes tender American divorce, although the breakdown of the relationship was not easy to be decent, they still gave each other and their children a lot of love. Although the US system is complicated and sometimes ridiculous (such as sending an observer to observe the father's flustering and embarrassment when getting along with the child), it is still very humane in general, and ca n't live together and is still the closest family member. Refusing to acknowledge existing feelings. In terms of actors, the widow's performance has been very stylized, and she can't get out of the set she has already been in full swing; and the male lead Adam is the treasure actor. He is too good and the play is all on him. A lot of sparkling performances, a lot of golden lines, a lot of humorous moments, a sad and quite humorous film, put forward new thinking on modern husband and wife relationship: 'Virgin Mary gave birth to Jesus as a virgin, and people demand women Immaculate, but what about Jesus 'father? He did n't show up at all,",9,3,4,20 March 2020

","The two people listened to the love song in the audition room. In the cramped space, they wanted to see each other, but they were somewhat reserved, and they left as soon as their eyes touched.

Jojo Rabbit," Jojo
","'The Joker's Whimsical World' unveiled the real world wrapped in icing with a brisk and smooth rhythm, turning the boy's growth story from blind obedience to questioning into a warm and sad war fairy tale. I can fully feel it. The director tries to tell through the film the loss and gain, pain and joy, imitation and courage that may be experienced in the growth process, and amplify the nature of love and hope in life. Personally, I have recently seen many movies that describe children entering the adult world, but only 'The Joker's Whimsical World' can make such a huge contrast without any child inappropriate lens, which is quite strong. Resonance and reflection space.I like 'The Young Man's Whimsical World' to bring out the ruthless wars of the Second World War era through the characters' views and mood changes, and the contrast highlights the warmth and preciousness of emotions between family and family. The whole movie is full of emotions, not only playing the role of the director of the boy 's imaginary father Hitler, Taiga Viditi, but also the supporting roles of Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. The audience saw that even in the most cruel times, there are many things that we should cherish. Just as the Jews are no different from us, the children in Nazi Germany are also so naive.",8,0,0,20 March 2020

","Imagination is infinite. It can break away from our body, go deep into space, and be meticulous to molecular atoms. It is the most vital source of humankind's creativity. But at the same time, human fantasy does not reflect its limitations all the time. You see all kinds of monsters in the film, even the least adult Jabba has faces and arms. In the robot, except for the R2D2 like a trash can, the rest are also based on humanoids.
