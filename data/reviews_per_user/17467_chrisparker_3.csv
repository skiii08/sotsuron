Hereditary," Not the greatest Horror film in the world
","I went into this, knowing the rave reviews, and it was supposedly the new thing in horror, but had no,idea what it was about. It starts with death notice and I'm thinking Old lady haunts family? Nope. Then the young girl starts hearing voices so I'm thinking again haunting. Kid get head chopped off, so back to square one. The mother then meets a 'random' lady outside a grief counciling meeting, then on another 'random' meet in a car park she tells the mother that she's now a medium and can help her get in touch with her dead daughter. Turns out random lady knew her mother and both were witches. Then we get stuff moving on it's own, people getting set on fire, the mothers body ending up in the attic, people on the ceiling and the son being pronounced the devil, by head less bodies. At least that what I think happened. Still not sure So top horror films are still
Exorcist
Evil Dead
Carrie 
The Omen
HalloweenThis isn't one of them",6,2,4,18 July 2018
Ready Player One," No wow factor
","The previous 2 films I have seen was Black Panther and Red Sparrow. Both left me leaving the cinema thinking that was good or wow, I didn't see that coming. This film did nothing. I sat there expecting to really be entertained. I wasn't. I didn't laugh, cry or was bothered about what happened to any of the characters. Half of it is like watching a video game, a dull one at that.",4,9,20,4 April 2018
Mother!," WTF did I just watch
","I had seen a little trailer and thought it was a supernatural horror.! In a way it is, but not what I was thinking. Sat through 2 hours and after the film,both me and the wife looked at each other in disbelief. Came on here and saw that it's a modern take on God, creation, Adam and Eve. Would I have known what it was about otherwise? No. We were thinking Sixth Sense where one is a ghost.",7,1,1,7 June 2018
