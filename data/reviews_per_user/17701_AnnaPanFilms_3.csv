Captain Phillips," Power Politics
","So, America is this powerful, rich, great country full of educated people with humanity, and this little third-world poor country, Somalia, is just so uncivilized, so pathetic, therefor they are dirty and ugly, they have to have big yellow teeth, and they are cruel, they are disordered, they are just doomed to be so hateful?! What the F is this! Just because you are powerful, so you can manipulate the poor however you want?! Make yourself a hero, and other people just a bunch of rats? I really felt so shameful for this movie. Yes, I know 'its based on true story'. BlaBlaBla I just hate you rape people all over to make yourself look so good. My heart hurts for Somalia. Remember this conversation: -Captain Philips: 'it shouldn't be like that way, you must have other things to do' -Poor Somalian:'maybe in America, maybe in America.'Go check out those poor Somalia actors, their IMDb page is as empty as mine. Captain Philips probably is the biggest and only movie in their lives. But think about how their people would think of them in Somalia??..oh maybe not, they are too poor to afford a movie theater. Don't get me wrong, I love the US, I just hate politics too much.All in all, from a filmmaking's perspective, it is a great movie. But if you hate hegemonies and power politics like I do, don't go see it and get upset. Make a donation to Somalia instead. Remember, they didn't want to be poor, they didn't want to kill anyone, they had no choice. They really were just fishermen. (I am posting this to IMDb right now, I hope your powerful country would not reject my post!)",Null,6,18,12 October 2013
Ender's Game," Ender's Game blew me away!!
","Went to the theatre with low expectations, but Ender's Game blew me away!! It was a great great great story! Even though it was hard to compress a whole book into a 2-hour film, I still felt the depth of the original book, even deeper and more profound I would assume. It was so good my soul was melted in that world. Story! Story! Story! Story is always the number one thing of a movie, all the other things like cinematography, art design, visual effects, even acting can all be secondary, but story can not. Without a good story, the film means nothing! (However, Asa Butterfield's acting was spectacular. Even just a few seconds close-up on his eyes, he was able to express so much information and emotions. Bravo!) I do not see this movie as sci-fi. The whole communicating-with-aliens part was cheesy and even laughable. I think this is a story about humanity and questioning the morality of the universe. Should we change the rules? because the rules do not apply anymore when it comes to a whole another world. Then, what is 'right'? what is 'wrong'? Or, does it even matter anymore? Great movie. And yes, please watch it on IMAX.",Null,3,8,3 November 2013
Her," I felt I died
","#Oscar is later today, but I've already picked my BEST of the year. Rarely can a movie break my heart this much. It touches the deepest level of human emotions. We are so so so so so small. Even our love is so limited. And loneliness is the ultimate fate for everyone of us. Cannot control tears while watching this story. Scarlett Johansson did not appear once, but only based on her voice, her performance deserves any award in the world. Other actors are all amazing. Cinematography is incredibly beautiful. Story itself is heart felt and heart breaking. I felt I died.Similar movies are: Gattaca, Be Right Back (from Black Mirror Season 2) Spike Jonze is Buddhist? It seems all the great movies all tend to use Buddhism as the base of their philosophy. Physical world is too limited. We are all trapped physically. Only our minds can go some where else we truly want to be. ..but what is the next of all these?After the movie, I tried to talk to Siri, but he is still too stupid at this point. I can only hope I could still be alive when technology develops real AI. Sending my respect to Dr. Michio Kaku.",Null,0,2,1 March 2014
