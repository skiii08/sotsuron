The Blair Witch Project," Nice idea...
","...that completely failed.Who are the sheltered individuals that were frightened by this movie?  I believe this movie was completely over-hyped, and that may be why I was disappointed.  'You've got to use your imagination, man!', they say.Please.I would have imagined a better way to tell the story.",1,3,6,14 February 2003
Mulholland Drive," Hmmmm?
",I hated it.  I loved it.  I wish I would have never wasted my time watching it.  I'm going to sit in a corner and watch it over and over until my existence comes to an end.  The greatest movie ever.  The worst p.o.s. I have ever seen.You figure it out.,1,4,12,13 April 2002
Pulp Fiction," I love this movie!
","This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it and that is why I think it is one of the best to come along in quite awhile!  Don't look for this to be an uplifting or moving experience.  All there is to see is the disgusting underbelly of society, which I think needs to be shown. Tarantino may have blown his mental load on this picture but that is o.k. The dialog is just top notch.  I haven't really told you anything about the movie but this is just the best example of what the movie is about....nothing.  But it still kicks ass.",10,1,2,28 December 2001
