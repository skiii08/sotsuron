The Blair Witch Project," Bring a blankey with you for comfort!
","I think the people who will this movie the most terrifying are the ones who videotape anything and everything - like I do. The kids - Josh, Heather & Mike - tape and film each other taping and filming. The effect is very realistic - at first, it's a lark. They go to the grocery store, they joke around, they stock up on supplies. As they realize they're lost, the tension among the three grows apparent. The swearing increases. The trio talk like 'real people.' As the movie progressed, I felt like running out of the theatre just so I could see lights & people & traffic. Great concept, great dialogue - and true terror. We don't need to see blood & guts to be frightened out of our wits.",Null,1,2,13 August 1999
The Mummy Returns," Non-stop action and many homages to great films
","This film hits you from almost the moment it begins - there are battles from beginning to end, even between locations - including on a double-decker bus.Watch for tributes to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'Jason & the Argonauts' (soldier mummies), 'Wizard of Oz' (those mummies again - they act like the Flying Monkeys), 'Doctor Zhivago' and 'Braveheart' - Spielberg is saluted a number of times, including a 'bike-by-the-full-moon' nod to Amblin (except this time it's a homemade dirigible) - and the balloon itself is straight out of 'Time Bandits' or 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.'Great chemistry between Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz - even better than in 'The Mummy'. Arnold Vosloo continues to be an awfully sympathetic character as far as I'm concerned (his girlfriend, Patricia Velazquez, is such a wench). The beautifully orchestrated combat scenes between Weisz and Velazquez alone are worth the price of admission.Great tongue-in-cheek humor - the kid, Freddie Boath gets some of the best lines. This is a great summer flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, and I'll bet Ray Harryhausen is wishing he could have used great f/x like these.",Null,0,0,4 May 2001
