The Avengers," Assembled awesomeness
","Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last century, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the people who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the names Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk. Comics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They weren't like the comics, took themselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made. The story itself is about heroes with flaws, who need to grow together as a team so they can save the world from a mighty attack from other world. If you like stories of heroes and strange folks you should go see this movie. It's not perfect, but very close being perfect.",9,2,7,28 April 2012
