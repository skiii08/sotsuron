The Blair Witch Project," Truly the scariest film I have ever seen
","This, is the scariest film I have ever seen. The basic story deals with 3 students investigating an old legend. When something strange begins to happend we witness a slow disintegration of the characters as they try to deal with what is happening to them. I felt I would behave in exactly the same way as the characters in the film and this allowed me to be drawn into the story. This film does not have any soundtrack or traditional camera trickery used in typical movies. If you go in expecting The Exorcist you will be disappointed, but if you are prepared to forget that the story is not true and allow yourself to be drawn in then you begin to experience the terror I felt while watching this film.I don't think it will stand up to too many repeated viewings as the film relies on suspense, more so than most films, and an element of that is always lost when you know what is going to happen.",10,1,2,4 November 1999
Dawn of the Dead," Great fun
","This is not a scary movie - it is a Zombie movie and it does it well. The cast performed their roles well - nothing oscar worthy of course but perfect performances for the film.There are several comedy moments (intentional) and these make a welcome break in the tension of the film.Everything kicks off fairly quickly - no pointless hour long examination of how origin of the Zombies (I imagine this is covered in the previous incarnation - although it is a while since i have seen the remake of The Night Of The Living Dead). I am a fan of the original trilogy and I still enjoyed this sequel - the gore is more believable as you would expect in an update (blood is slightly less fluorescent than in the original) the shocks are there, the updated Zombies are excellent - they are fast and dangerous - a big problem i had with the original was that the 'Shuffling Zombies' required you to be very very very careless to be caught by them - not these new ones, they will chase you down and tear you apart given half the chance.More could have been made of them being holed up in the Shopping Mall, like in the original, you never felt they were in any serious threat inside the Mall from the Zombies - although this was adequately replaced by a fear of each other.Stay all the way to the end credits as more action occurs during these - I liked this way of ending - it would have been a 'Too many endings' syndrome if they had tried to put this in as a traditional end of the film but making it interspersed during the credits was a nice touch.See this film if you are not upset by gore, not expecting a frame-by-frame remake of the original (why would anybody bother to do this - Take Note producers of the Psycho remake), or expecting a reworking of a literary classic - this movie does not try to be any of these things and lets you enjoy it for it's own merits8/10",8,0,0,30 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A big improvement over Phantom Menace
","Silly title notwithstanding I did enjoy this film. It seemed back to the old school of Star Wars film making. A nice story reasonably well told and entertaining to a mixture of age groups.Acting: I thought some of the acting was a little odd - I don't think Ewan can quite pull off the upper crust accent very well - it always sounds a little strained. This rigid attempt to stick to a voice style causes his delivery to sound stilted and monotone. Haydn is passable as Anakin Skywalker but he did not project the emotional torment his character was occasionally suffering - but he handled the action sequences reasonably well. Christopher Lee was excellent as Count Dooku adding that air of menace that was missing, ironically, from the Phantom Menace. Natalie Portman gives another fine performance. And Yoda .... Yoda's scenes were interesting - unable to reveal more - well worth seeing Yoda in the film :-)Directing: During action sequences I thought the directing was great - the was pace kept nice giving the watcher an exilerating experience in the Cinema. Also reasonably good during the - less emotionally charged scenes such as meetings between council members and the like but during emotional scenes I feel George Lucas does not help his actors. Some of the scenes lacked emotional depth for me and not for a need of actors capable of delivering these performances. It seemed that some of the dialogue that seemed to need emotional and charged execution was delivered fairly flat. A different director may have tried to put the cast's talents to better use.Story: A great story - a good old fashioned yarn in the spirit of Episode 4 to 6. The story is not too childish to appeal to the older audience and still I can imagine it entertaining children.SFX: As would be expected the SFX look quite astounding - from the busy metropolis of Coroscent (sp?) to the inevitable light sabre battles. All look fantastic and don't overwhelm the picture.Overall: well worth watching (in the cinema) I would rate it under Episode 4 and 5 but above Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi as I did not spot a single Ewok and Binks was hardly in it. 7/10",7,0,0,21 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," not as bad as I thought it would be
","I've seen this movie twice now - once on my own when I was a little bit drunk (and therefore not paying too much attention) and once with a friend when relatively sober. The first time I hated it - thought it was a cheap rip off - stealing scenes and lines from the original two movies. The second time I saw it I was starting to warm towards it and took the scene and line stealing as what I am sure it was intended, a homage to the first movies.The action scenes were fairly good - Arnie could still cut it reasonably well as the terminator despite his age. The new terminator resembled the characteristics (the mannerisms not the physicality) of the T-1000 (Robert Patric) from T2 and this sorts of fits with the whole improved terminator line, i.e. less robotic more human. There were some glaring holes which although I tried hard I could not ignoreSpoiler possibility (I will keep as vague as possible) The secret base was stunningly unguarded, in fact most of the military establishments appear to have an open door policy for strangers :-)I won't go into anymore but there are someOne of the things I did not like at all was the development of the John Connor character. This I feel betrayed the first 2 movies. In the first movie, Sarah Connor starts off weak and becomes strong. In the second movie, John Connor starts off strong and gets stronger. In the third movie John Connor appears to have had a personality change. He seems like a frightened and confused child - not at all like the strong willed resourceful character from the second film. This grated on me a bit as he seemed very whiny and weak in this movie.The  ending was reasonably good - covering the 'The future is not fixed' sort of scenario and therefore allowing the rules to be broken from one movie to the next in a reasonably sensible way (As sensible as you can get with time travel movies).Summary Direction - nice and fast paced - all you would expect from a T2 movie. Acting - mmmm, ok - but then again you are not expecting Shakespeare here Script - Some corny lines but generally sufficient Story - Reasonably good6/10",6,0,0,1 August 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Darker, slightly rushed - but still great fun
","Start off by saying this was my favourite book of the 5 released so far. The first two are a little bit childish (as is their intention - no problem with that) the last two are a little bit padded. Prisoner of Azkaban the book had the perfect blend of active story and back story (for me). So I was really looking forward to the film but was a little bit dubious about the running time, fearing that essential elements of the book would be cut. My fears were realised when seeing the film. Several important elements of the book were removed or shortened to fit into the film's running time which I feel detracted from the film a little bit, including the origin of the Marauders Map, the relationship between all the parties involved etc. The pace of the film was very fast as it tried to cram in as much as possible leaving no time to pause and reflect on the characters. The character of Sirius, although played well by Gary Oldman, was not on screen enough and the fear of his impending presence was not put across well enough (in the books he is so feared that even the 'muggle' police have heard of him).The three main characters did a reasonable job again - especially Rupert Grint and Emma Watson who I feel are getting better each film.Alan Rickman as Professor Snape was a little under used as he was important character in the book and was terrific in the first 2 films.Good things. special effects were, as expected, excellent. Buck Beak looked awesome. The Dementors looked pretty good as well. The Dementor 'Effect' was well realised and did a pretty good job of visualising the slightly difficult concept of having your happiness sucked out of you.For all the minor niggles i raised earlier i still loved this film - great fun, a little scary in parts for younger children (the werewolf scenes were excellent).8/10",8,0,0,6 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Can an animated character win best Actor ?
","First I would like to say that I read the book a long time ago but I am not a rabid fan. The odd changes to the story I can live with as books and films are not the same (that is to you fanboys and fangirls).This was an awesome film in every way which got even better the second time I watched it. From the initial sequence right through the climatic scenes this seemed so much more than the first film and I loved that.The thing that struck me the most was Smeagol / Gollum. Not just the CGI that is used to create him (although that is as good as we were led to believe and makes that silly House Elf from the boy wizard film look like Mickey Mouse). It was Andy Serkis - the emotion and torment he filled the character with made me feel for him in much bigger way than I ever did when reading the book. The way the character kept swaying between Gollum and Smeagol kept me hooked to the screen more than any other part of the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by the look of the ents as I had been worried that these would just look stupid. This gives me hope for the final film and some of the more outlandish characters in that.My only fault, although this is more with the book than the film, is that Frodo and Sam's relationship is a bit too much sometimes - I'm not sure what it is - I can see why their were rumours on the net that the two were homosexual as the book although not saying this gave them a friendship that I cannot imagine outside of a loving intimate one (maybe that is my jaded view of the world though). I have no problems with homosexual relationships on film but this sort of is nearly but not quite there.See this film and then see it again but don't drink lots of soft drink before going in (like I did the first time - doh!) as it's a long film that only bladder will clue you in on.",10,0,0,5 February 2003
Mulholland Drive," A good discussion movie
","While I was watching Mulholland Drive I wasn't sure what to make of it - the film seemed to delight in trying to confuse the viewer, but maybe that was the intention. I went to see it with about 4 other people and spent over an hour arguing and chatting about the film - Can't see me doing that with your average film. The more we discussed it the more it seemed to make at least semi-sense. My advice definitely go with a group.The acting was reasonbly good and there were some very funny comedy moments - especially Justin Theroux as the movie director. I felt for him in his confusion. Although the hitman was amusing as well.I don't think it would have taken a great deal of alteration to make this movie appeal to a more mainstream audience - but then he wouldn't be David Lynch.Camera focus seemed to drift in and out occasionally and this may have been many things - the projectionist - bad camera work - or intentional to confuse the watcher, I haven't made up my mind which one yet.Summary If you do go and see this - don't judge it straight away, give it a chance to become clearer in your mind. 7/10",7,0,0,24 April 2002
The Sixth Sense," Average suspense movie with an interesting ending
","I went to see The Sixth Sense last night with no expectations one way or another, and I was not impressed in either a good or a bad way. The acting was OK, nothing special the plot was fairly run of the mill. The only bit that I didn't see coming was the ending - which raised it from a '4' to a 5. The scary parts relied on the tried and tested 'loud noise makes you jump' formula used time and time again. Overall: By all means see this one and see it all the way to the finish as the ending is the best part.",6,0,0,21 November 1999
