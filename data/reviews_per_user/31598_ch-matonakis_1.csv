The Expendables 2," Could be much better but still worth watching ..
","If anyone was fully aware of what to expect this was a fine movie. Shootings, beatings, killings, and all the casting we admired during the 80s and 90s... Very nice indeed....There's a big ''but'' for me though...Since the difficult part was achieved - all the big stars together- why the easy task was not fulfilled...???? Try to play as professional actors..!!!! It was obvious that they did it for fun... Even Bruce Willis didn't take his role seriously... Not to mention Chuck Norris and Van Damme who were smiling while talking...Although you didn't expect Al Pacino performance or Copola directing, it's a pity because the movie had potentials... That leaves you with a bittersweet taste at the end...Surely deserved 7/10",7,4,8,4 September 2012
