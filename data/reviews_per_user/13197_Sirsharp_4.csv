Scarface," Take a look at the bad guy!!
","****Contains spoilers*****  ****Spoilers within****This movie is awesome. I have seen it somewhere near 100 times. Each time I do, I see something new. This is Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles as Tony Montana.  The Cuban refugee turned Drug Dealer.  This combined with an utterly fabulous Soundtrack, including songs sung by Amy Holland. What more can you ask for.The movie is filled with a lot of violence including a chain saw sequence that still makes me flinch every I hear the sound of one.One of the best parts of the whole movie is the climax.  Tony Montana has crossed all his associates, killed his best friend and has hit rock bottom. He has his head pile of cocaine, and is faced with a mob of hired killers. Some of the best lines ever said in a movie take place in the final minutes of the movie. Including, 'Say hello to my little friend!!'I purchased a VHS version a long time ago.  Its worth every dollar I paid for it.  I also own the soundtrack, which is also worth every dollar I paid for it!!I give this movie a 9 out of 10",Null,0,1,12 August 2003
Scary Movie 2," Just down right bad. Some movies are best with no sequels.
","I saw the first part; Scary movie, and thought this may be worth seeing. But when I saw this movie, I was shocked.  I must say it is just down right bad. Tori Spelling gives one of the worst performances of her career. Don't waist your money on it.I give this a big fat 0",Null,0,1,12 August 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Worth seeing but a bitter pill for fans of the first one to swallow...
","John Depp (Wonka) is the key most important part of this movie...along with the kid who plays Charlie (Freddie Highmore)...Together they make the movie worth seeing...BUT...if you are a fan of the original.... there is a high chance you will be disappointed in this one to a point....I think this movie is best seen...without having seen the original....in fact if you can try to put the original out of your mind...and pretend you are seeing this for the first time...it's decent....It has some pretty funny jokes in it....the Oompa Loompa...songs are more modern..but are very hard to understand at times....On a scale from one to ten...I give this a 5.5, because it's good at times...and has it's moments....but since I was a fan of the original...it was also at times a bitter pill for me to swallow...",6,0,1,27 July 2005
The Breakfast Club," A timeless movie that takes a look at teen life
","This is a timeless movie that takes a look at teen life.  It is a great story line.  Keep in mind, each of us growing up come from different walks of life. This movie looks only at a few, and from a narrow point of view. I have read other comments here that the characters are stereo typical, and that teachers weren't like the one potrayed in the movie.  Bad news for you, I grew up with kids similar to these and I had a teacher who was exactly like the one in the film.  This movie hits home.  I give it an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,1,11 August 2003
