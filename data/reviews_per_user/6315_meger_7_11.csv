Mission: Impossible III," Cruise into this incredible MISSION!
","There is no vacation, no time off, and no escape for newly dubbed IMF trainer Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), when it comes to impossible missions. You see, when you're the best at something, its hard for people not to recruit you and bring you in, which is why for the third time, Hunt is coming back to work to help lead and direct the next impossible task. The mission for Hunt, if he chooses to accept is, to assemble a team and rescue one of his top trainees Lindsey (Keri Russell), who was captured while on a simple reconnaissance mission. Sounds simple enough, but once into it Hunt realizes there is a lot more to just Lindsey being at the wrong place at the wrong time, after finding out Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a malicious arms dealer, was behind the whole thing. Shortly after that when Hunt and Davian cross paths, Davian swears to get back at Hunt in the worst way possible, by hurting everything that Hunt held dear. That of course meant Hunt's fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who up to this point had no idea what her fiancée really did for a living. But, all that would change quickly when Davian gets his hands on Julia, forcing Hunt and his team {Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (Maggie Q)} into a new rescue mission, all the while stopping Davian from doing whatever he had plans to do, eventually leading to a wild conclusion full of twists and turns.Setting aside my bias nature for Cruise and everything he does in film, this cast was one to remember at the end of the day. Having a great iconic leader in Cruise though never hurts, but I must say everyone else involved here pulled their weight very well, making this, in my opinion, the best cast of the entire series. Clearly any cast led by Cruise is one to watch, but to then bring in such polished veterans like Laurence Fishburne and Philip Seymour Hoffman was something else. Both these guys know their way around the big screen and no point did I feel they were taking away from the other less notable actors like Michelle Monaghan, Billy Crudup, Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Hoffman especially made this movie a ton better in a role I thought I would never see him in, but apparently there's nothing this guy can't do. But, any actor that can steal scenes away from Tom Cruise has some talent worth talking about. And to do it with such power was awesome to watch and see. I mean, just in those few scenes with him and Cruise; you could feel every moment and just get stuck within the drama taking place.Of course, much of that could be due to Cruise too, as he was as cool as ever reprising the role that has made him so much money over the years. And to me, you just can't say enough about a guy who takes it up that extra notch every time he steps on a movie set, to make sure everything is perfect and accounted for. Cruise sells his roles so well and to me might be the only actor who you can literary get stuck watching with the mindset that your still watching Tom Cruise. That's bigger than life folks and why he is the man among men in Hollywood. However, as I said earlier, he wasn't alone and back along his side once again was Ving Rhames, playing the very lovable, yet cunning Luther. Rhames, along with the rest of the cast already mentioned made this film about as smooth as it could get.As much as the story and cast made M:I:III what it was, it would have been nothing without the clever writing and direction of J.J. Abrams. And to think, two directors bailed before Abrams got the call. But, that's the reality for Abrams, who for those that don't know, just happens to be the brilliant innovator of TV hits Alias and Lost. And now, to add to his resume the co-writer and director of M:I:III, a film that should go down as the best of the three. Of course, time will tell whether that's true or not, but know this, without Abrams, this movie would have never risen above all that follows Cruise these days. I don't know, there' just something about the way Abrams choreographs scenes and sets them up, that is like no other. This is especially true with his action scenes and sequences, which by the way, is the mantra for this coveted series. He just knows how to shoot some action and he does it with such intensity. For anyone that has seen Alias or even Lost, neither show is lacking in the intensity department. So, already knowing that, I expected a lot from Abrams, and he still blew me away with some of the most incredible and intense action I have seen in some time. That combined with his ingenious writing, collaborating with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci on the script, made quite the summer blockbuster to watch. And if this is what Abrams brings to the table in his directorial debut on the big screen, I can only imagine what's next for a guy who can't seem to cool off these days.Setting aside all the negative press surrounding Tom Cruise these days, the one thing I know is this, the guy can make some movies. Intense action sequences, coupled with a script that is better than most highlight this action thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. So, forget about everything you may have read or heard and just go see M:I:III, as it is probably the best and most enjoyable piece to this amazing series.",9,2,3,12 May 2006
Lords of Dogtown," Skating ecstasy
","Creating a feature film on radical sports like surfing and skateboarding is no easy task, which is why you see most of those filmmakers settle on documentaries. But, every now and then a filmmaker will get an idea and put it to a test as a feature film. That's what writer/director John Stockwell did with BLUE CRUSH a few years ago and I think I remember it fairing quite well. The harsh truth to movies like BLUE CRUSH and now LORDS OF DOGTOWN is there's simply not enough of them. Maybe if more feature films were made instead of documentaries in this genre, the quality would be better, but when all we have to compare it to is some extreme documentary with 'alternative' music, it's hard to look past the action and see the story taking place. And, I think that's what many critics will do with LORDS OF DOGTOWN, the new skating/surfing film by writer Stacy Peralta who also just happens to be one of the famed 'Z-Boys' himself, the same group featured in the film.The story in LORDS OF DOGTOWN is all about the Z-Boys, who were Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) and Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) and the mark they made on the sport of skateboarding. Starting out, the Z-Boys were just boys wanting to be surfers like the other locals in Venice, Calif., who had reigned in every piece of the sport. The leader and guy the Z-Boys looked up to was Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger), owner of the Zephyr surf shop where the whole gang hung out from time to time. It was the 70s and all they had then was pretty much surfing, but one day Skip was handed some new 'in-line' skateboarding wheels to test out that would eventually turn his and the newly dubbed Z-Boys' world around. The next thing you know, the Z-Boys are turning crazy moves on their skateboards in drained swimming pools (or what they called a wave that never breaks) and competitions, starting a skating craze across the country. And, with this kind of success comes money, fame and girls, all of which that can test the very best of friendships. In the end, however, it was all about the skating, leaving a question of whether or not that was enough to keep the trio together? I'm not sure how closely the cast modeled the original Z-Boys, but with Stacy Peralta involved, I can only imagine he did his best. And really, the cast in this one was great, lead by none other than Heath Ledger, who I must say was impressive as Skip. Ledger, who played a convincing drunk the entire film, did not overpower the rest of the cast. If anything, he took a backseat, which is exactly what director Catherine Hardwicke wanted. The rest of the cast was chosen well and seemed to feed off each other quite nicely. The one-standout performance is my mind though was Emile Hirsch (THE GIRL NEXT DOOR), who in my mind had the toughest role to play in Jay Adams. Hirsch's character probably had the most talent, but chose a separate road without the fame and fortune. This created much emotion and struggles, played very nicely by Hirsch.It almost goes without saying that the action and extreme camera-work was top notch in LORDS OF DOGTOWN. For anyone who has seen a surfing documentary, you already know how this camera-work plays out, but for those of you who haven't seen it before, get ready to be taken on a wild ride. Having already done the famed documentary DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS, I'm almost positive Stacey Peralta had a lot to say about how certain skating scenes should go. In fact, it was said that the real Tony Alva helped Peralta and Hardwicke choreograph several of the scenes, showing the young actors how the Z-Boys should skate and act.But, it wasn't as much skating, as it was the balance of the story with it, which is where Harwicke shines. She has a way of bringing out as much emotion as possible, and it worked really well in this film. That balance only fueled the action taking place, leaving you to watch and wonder what extreme act would happen next. Many critics see this story as weak, but how powerful of a story do you need for a group of famous skaters? The pure drama of their lives is enough for me to enjoy and take in, which I believe is all Peralta wanted in the end.LORDS OF DOGTOWN definitely isn't for everyone, but I would think anyone that has the least bit interest in surfing or skating will enjoy and appreciate the true essence of this story. It's hard not to love extreme skating and surfing, but when it's shot under the watchful eye of two of the Z-Boys themselves, it can't get much better than that. But, this movie was more than just a showcase for skating, it was a drama and I personally feel director Catherine Hardwicke (THIRTEEN) did an excellent job in showing the emotional struggles these so-called 'Z-Boys' went through while revolutionizing the sport of skateboarding in the 70s.B+",7,2,14,10 June 2005
The Aviator," Fly high with this historical gem
","Some people say you can't be born a legend, you can only become one. Well, I think in the case of Martin Scorsese, it's a little bit of both. You see, when you're watching a Scorsese film, you're watching movie-making at its best. No detail is left behind in his films which is just one of the many reasons why Scorsese is one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. Over the years Scorsese has put out some masterpieces and although he has won numerous awards for his work, he has yet to hold the coveted Oscar statuette in his hand. A couple years ago when GANGS OF NEW YORK was being promoted, everyone thought it would be the one to give Scorsese his first Oscar, but as most of us saw, that didn't happen. Instead we saw the much acclaimed musical CHICAGO take home the gold. Two years later, we find Martin Scorsese to be in the same exact position, only it's with THE AVIATOR now. Will the same fate hit Scorsese again with Adrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, yet another musical? Or will the academy finally award him for not just his magnificent work on THE AVIATOR, but for everything he has brought to movies over the past 30 years? This film is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, one of the first true millionaires of America. Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), who was only a teenager when he inherited his family's tool business, had dreams that most of us couldn't even begin to think of. One of his dreams was to make a motion picture, which he did with HELL'S ANGELS, a film that not only introduced Hughes to Hollywood, but introduced him to such movie starlets as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Having always had a love of aviation, Hughes decided to build the world's fastest plane during the making of HELL's ANGELS, a project that proved to be successful one clear day in 1935. After being dubbed the 'world's fastest man,' Hughes decided to broaden his spectrum of wealth by purchasing the airline company TWA (TransWorld Airlines). He even began to build a special spy plane for the government, but all was not well in Hughes mind as time passed by. After being dumped by Hepburn, a new enemy arrived for Hughes, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), president and CEO of America's leading airline PanAm. And Trippe, with politicians on his side, set out to destroy not only TWA, but Hughes himself leading the great aviator to fight mental demons he never thought he would have; demons that would eventually leave the pioneer at rock bottom. But, just when you think Hughes has no fight left in him, he picks himself back up and somehow manages to rise to the top again in a fashion that could only be expected from Howard Hughes.Ever since GANGS OF NEW YORK, I had the feeling that we would see Scorsese and DiCaprio team up again, but who would have guessed it would be DiCaprio coming to Scorsese instead of the other way around? As it turns out, DiCaprio is a huge Howard Hughes fan, so when he gave the idea to Scorsese, how could the great director refuse? Well, I'm confident that Scorsese sees something in young Leo, which is probably why he agreed to direct the film. Scorsese allows his young actor to pretty much open up his talents, which couldn't have been a better decision. Going back to WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, I could see the endless potential DiCaprio, but I would never expected such a performance like the one he turned in for THE AVIATOR. He truly became Howard Hughes inside and out balancing the true nature of what made Hughes a legendary industrialist and pioneer. But, DiCaprio was not the only star in this film; he had some great talent around him led by Cate Blanchett, who just seems to get better with time. Blanchett, who played Katherine Hepburn, captured the true essence of why Hepburn was a marvel in Hollywood. And then there was Kate Beckinsale, who did a tremendous job in playing Ava Gardner, the new and upcoming star of the times. Beckinsale, who most people will remember from PEARL HARBOR, in my mind, is starting to come into her own as an actress. Only time will tell us how great she actually becomes. But, the one guy that many will forget from this film will be Alec Baldwin, who played the evil PanAm CEO Trippe. Even though Baldwin doesn't occupy much of the films 168 minute running time, his presence is known in every scene in which he appears, reaffirming his talent as being the best among his brothers.Many critics will downplay this film because it drags and it's too long. And, although I do agree that the film felt longer than it was, that's one of the aspects that I come to appreciate with a Martin Scorsese film. I mean, going in I know it will feel like a 6-hour film, but I don't care. In fact, I look forward to it because there's no other director in Hollywood that can do the things that Scorsese does behind the camera, and no other director that can bring in the type of emotion that Marty can bring. He may spend more time on scenes, but every detail is played out which ultimately makes his films complete. And in THE AVIATOR, Scorsese has clearly done just that bringing in all the emotion and features that made Howard Hughes who he was.I don't know what the future holds for THE AVIATOR, but if my predictions are right, it will be covered in gold. Not only did Martin Scorsese capture the true essence of Howard Hughes and what he meant to this country, he allowed Leonardo DiCaprio to run with the character which ultimately left no stone unturned.",8,8,12,3 February 2005
Batman Begins," A beginning like no other
","It's been 16 years since the world was introduced to BATMAN on the big screen and oh, how we cherished that film and the sequel that came after it. I say sequel, because the 'other' two films that came after BATMAN RETURNS were a disgrace to the comic book franchise. The truth is, it's been almost 9 years since George Clooney graced us as the caped hero and that was just about long enough for me to forget about how stupid and cheesy it and it's predecessor really were. Luckily for us though, time heals, so by the time the idea for BATMAN BEGINS was released to the public, I think we were all ready for something new and exciting. And I must say we got what we wanted, plus 100 times more in what many critics, including myself, are dubbing the best BATMAN flick yet.With a cast like the one in BATMAN BEGINS, it's hard to single out just one actor. Even before seeing this film, I felt like no other actor would match Michael Keaton's performances in the first two BATMAN flicks, but Christian Bale did, plus some. And Bale (AMERICAN PSYCHO, EQUILIBRIUM, THE MACHINIST) wasn't just good, he was convincing, yet raw, which played nicely to the story going on. Bale brought all the anger into the role that was needed and just ran with it. But, that wasn't all. He was great without the cape too, cracking jokes and pulling off that playboy charm we all love in the Bruce Wayne character.Playing opposite Bale was such screen legends as Michael Caine, playing Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman, playing the tech-savy Lucius Fox and of course Liam Neeson, who was excellent as Ducard. But, at no point did any of these screen legends overpower Bale, which was needed to keep the focus on his character. Not even Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow, who was brilliant, overpowered Bale's Batman. And in reality, there probably could have been more Scarecrow/Batman exchanges, but who knows, maybe there will be in the next film. Filling out the rest of the powerful cast was Katie Holmes, who was good in her small role as assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes and Gary Oldman, who played a very convincing Jim Gordon, the last good cop left in Gotham.The one thing that is almost undeniable in BATMAN BEGINS is the amount of detail that was put into it. I can't think of anything that was missed or didn't flow with the rest of the story. That says something about director Christopher Nolan's (MEMENTO) work ethic, who is really a rookie director. It's clear he worked hard with screenwriter David S. Goyer (BLADE trilogy) on making sure he gathered all the right information on the cast of characters included in his film. Detail like that and the detail surrounding Batman himself was enough to ignite this film into something bigger than itself.I think the one aspect that defined this film was how well the story was molded into the action and special effects, something George Lucas obviously forgot to do with STAR WARS: EPISODE III Â– REVENGE OF THE SITH. Nolan did wonders with Goyer's story and made sure the effects around the story were not overdone, a key to films like this. The one aspect of the action that caught me by surprise though was Nolan's camera work with the fight sequences of Batman. Instead of just having a big open fight sequence, Nolan chose to use Batman's undeniable scare tactics on his victims as the biggest weapon, almost like an element of surprise. And you know, some critics say this film could have been better visually, but I disagree. I think the balance between the story and the special effects was perfect, right down to some of what I call the 'money shots' of Batman flying or standing atop a building.With two films to go, BATMAN BEGINS was the ideal start to refuel this once famed franchise. With a script that couldn't have been better, director Christopher Nolan earned his worth in Hollywood by producing one of the best adaptations of a graphic novel in recent memory. If you didn't know who Christian Bale was before this film, you certainly will after it, in a movie that almost makes you forget about any previous BATMAN flicks, which is a feat like no other if you ask me.A+",10,0,1,12 August 2005
War of the Worlds," Exterminating consequences?
","Since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, most Steven Spielberg fans have been looking for something more, something worthy to talk about for days, not just hours. That's not to say the films he has produced the past few years have been garbage, they're just not up the caliber most of us look for in a Spielberg film. In films like A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and THE TERMINAL, there's nothing that jumps out and grabs me like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did. And, then you have the 'popcorn' flicks like MINORITY REPORT and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN; both of which were fun to watch, but not as fun as previous gems like INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.So, no matter what type of Spielberg film you look at, he's been a little off lately. Maybe I'm being a little hard on him, but we are talking about arguably the best director of his time and one of the best directors Hollywood will ever see. In saying that, you can see how excited all of us fans were when the idea of WAR OF THE WORLDS was released, especially considering Spielberg's resume with aliens. And even with all the hype around Tom Cruise's personal life, it still comes down to the movie, and that was where all my expectations sat. Like most people I was looking at WAR OF THE WORLDS being this big spectacle of a film and although it came very close to that, it wasn't what I had hoped it would be in the end.When Tom Cruise is in a movie, does anyone else really matter? After seeing most Tom Cruise films, you don't remember who played opposite Cruise; you just remember what Cruise did and how he did it. That's the world Cruise lives with, in and out of movies, but when you're good, you're good. And Cruise once again was good, but that's almost a given in any of his movies if you ask me. The question is, was anyone else worthy of praise, and in this one, I would have to say not really. This film wasn't really about Cruise or anyone else, as it was about the ideal of an invasion of earth. That even goes for little Dakota Fanning, who even with all her talent, had a role that could have been played by any 10-year old girl. And then there was Tim Robbins and his role, which again was played well, but most actors not as talented as Robbins can pull off the role of being a refugee on the verge of madness. But, I realize if you bring a guy like Robbins in for this small bit part, he will do it well and be memorable, so I can understand Spielberg's thinking, but his role doesn't make or break the story.Recently we have been privileged to see some insane special effects from Steven Spielberg's films, and WAR OF THE WORLDS is no different. With tremendous sets to back up some of the CGI special effects, nothing bad can be said about the action and overall intensity oozing from this film. The opening 20 to 30 minutes is about as tense as it comes, where you are literary on the edge of your seat watching these machines terrorize our world. And, that feeling lasted for quite awhile too, right down to when you got your first glimpse of the aliens. But, like many of its predecessors, this film started to fail shortly after the appearance of the aliens on the screen.I don't know what it is about seeing the aliens that ruins films like WAR OF THE WORLDS, but it does every time and according to Wells' story, there wasn't a true need to do that until the very end. But, I guess with his fascination of aliens, Spielberg just could not resist the temptation. As tense as this film was, to not show the alien until the last shot would have improved this film dramatically, especially since that was where this film took a fall and never recovered.So, as highly anticipated as WAR OF THE WORLDS was, I would have hoped for something a little more. And at this point, I can't really put my fingers on exactly what that would be, but this film had the potential of being 'one of kind' for a very long time. However, just because WAR OF THE WORLDS, in my mind, could have been a tad bit better overall, it doesn't change the fact it was an event to see and something I would never deter fans from seeing.",7,0,1,15 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Humorous vows?
","Good concepts to certain films can go a long way and I think in the case of THE WEDDING CRASHERS, the concept itself sold the movie, at least to me. Sure, having Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson starring in it helps, but the concept alone seems like something original and funny, at least on the surface. But, comedies don't really need a thriving story line, just one that makes some sense, allowing openings for actors like Wilson and Vaughn to make people laugh. But, make no mistake about it, this duo of Wilson and Vaughn by no means compares to the classic THE BLUES BROTHERS pair of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, like some critics have voiced. As funny as these two guys are, comparing them to jokesters like Belushi and Aykroyd is jumping the gun a bit. Maybe after we see them in a more driven comedy, we can make comparisons, but for now they're just two funny guys with great chemistry that hopefully will make more movies together. And if those future movies are anything like THE WEDDING CRASHERS, we're all in for quite a treat, I think.What happens when you get two divorce mediators/attorneys together at a wedding they were not invited to? Well, they crash it of course and that's exactly the premise behind this story of Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson), who crash weddings in their spare time to pick up women. Sure, crashing weddings to pick up women is low and borderline sleezy, but it's funny and that's really all that matters. But, all the fun and games seem to end when the duo crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary William Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter and wind up falling for two bridesmaids Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher), who were also sisters to the bride and daughters to the Secretary. But, falling in love is not part of the 'wedding crashing' rules, so when John started to bend the rules a bit, Jeremy quickly got on his case, but the deed was done. John had already fallen for Claire and while he tried to figure out how to get closer to her, Jeremy was realizing just how nutty Claire's sister Gloria was, making up many of the stories hilarious parts. Between the two separate stories going on, you never had a chance to stop laughing, as John was able to be just as much the butt of a joke as Jeremy was, making up one heck of an ending that although predictable, was funny nonetheless.You can't really get too deep into this film without giving credit to the cast, led of course by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The two make up quite a duo, combining two different styles of comedy, which is never a bad thing. Wilson's slow, methodical ways of being funny matched Vaughn's speedy delivery of jokes was truly something to watch. They definitely complimented each other, allowing each other to show off their talents and still be funny together when the time came. And to me, Vaughn made the film what it was with his nonchalant facial expressions, adding to his crazy stories or acts. But, Wilson is no slouch either, as he seems to keep churning out one funny movie after another, the last one being STARSKY AND HUTCH with fellow jokster Ben Stiller. Having said that, the pair had quite a supporting cast led by Christopher Walken, who on the surface might not seem funny, but can spit out some funny lines if you watch him. But, then there was Rachel McAdams (THE NOTEBOOK), who's character seemed to always bring the rest of the group back down to earth, which was great considering her on-screen sister Isla Fisher (I HEART HUCKABEES) was busy making Vince Vaughn look like a fool. There's even a cameo appearance that will sure draw some laughs worthy of $20 million dollars. But, overall this cast worked well together complimenting Wilson and Vaughn each step of the way.THE WEDDING CRASHERS might not be up everyone's ally when it comes to comedies, but for those of us that enjoy watching actors make fools of themselves at the expense of good humor, this one is a keeper. With Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn leading a thriving cast of diverse talents, I can't imagine this film being any better. Sure there were a few parts that were a bit over the top and borderline sick, but that's the beauty of an R-rated comedy and one I would dub the best of the year thus far. So, even though this film might go too far for kids under 18 to watch, for those adults who still have a kid inside them, this one is for you.B+",7,1,2,12 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," STAR WARS on steroids
","Despite all the mixed reviews and arguments that surround STAR WARS: EPISODE III  REVENGE OF THE SITH, there is one thing we all can agree on, it's finally over. No more speculation or hype, the final piece of the puzzle has been placed, ending what I would dub as one of the worst trilogies of all time. In my mind, REVENGE OF THE SITH had no chance of pulling this prequel trilogy out of the black hole the first two films buried it in; so, even if this final installment was the best of the three, George Lucas messed this thing up a long time ago when he first sat down with the idea. With all the data and information at his disposal, you would think Lucas would have made a 'second coming' to the originals, but that obviously didn't happen. Instead we got STAR WARS on steroids and if you ask me, maybe Lucas should be testifying to Congress these days as well, because what he did should result in some kind of fine or ban from Hollywood.I have no doubt that Lucas did exactly what he wanted and I would bet the result is what he expected, but why turn your back on the fans that helped build the empire? It might be one thing to cater to these 'next generation' STAR WARS fans, but where's the balance, George? What happened to the storyline that made this series so popular? These are just some of the reasons why this new trilogy will undoubtedly be forgotten about when it's all said and done. The fame that surrounds the originals will not spill over to these past three episodes, no matter how many different DVD box sets are released. These past three films are mere 'wannabe's' and should not be considered with one of the best trilogies of all time. They might be good for the new fans, but for all of us who grew up with the originals, we won't treat them with the same respect.Now, don't get me wrong, I have no problem giving credit where credit is due, but just because REVENGE OF THE SITH is the best of the last three films, that doesn't mean it erases the previous two from memory. And, with how ridiculous the first two were, it doesn't take a whole lot to be better, so forgive me if I don't jump on the bandwagon of greatness with so many other critics. Despite REVENGE OF THE SITH being the closest thing to the originals, knowing what could have been is almost worst than seeing the reality of what we were given with these three episodes.C-",5,1,2,26 May 2005
Fantastic Four," A 'fantastic' ride plagued by doom?
","You would think by now we have seen all we can see when it comes to graphic novels in film, but it's clear we haven't with the release of THE FANTASTIC FOUR, the new Marvel gem. And, unlike many of its predecessor's, this one focuses on more than one star, four to be exact, which is four times the fun if you ask me. Unfortunately, not everyone feels the same way I do, as some critics are bombing on this film for its lack of a good script and experienced directing. But, to me that's a cheap way of saying this film has no life, but this is just another example of critics taking a film like this too seriously. I realize the bar is set fairly high on films of this genre, given the recent success of SPIDER-MAN, X-MEN and BATMAN, but I think sometimes you have to check your expectations at the door, which is what I did for THE FANTASTIC FOUR. This film may not have the highly developed story, but it has the one thing that all movies of this genre need, character. And it's that character that leads to enjoyment, which is really all any of us want when going to watch one of these films.The premise behind the story in this one focuses a group of individuals who, while on a relatively routine space mission, experience a freak cosmic storm that in turn changes their DNA forever. The trip was supposed to become the legacy of a selfish industrial scientist by the name of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), later to be known as Dr. Doom. But, when the storm ruins his plans, he decides to create his own storm, using his newly developed powers. Attempting to stop Dr. Doom was of course the rest of the group, part of freak accident in space: Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), a highly intelligent scientist, later to be dubbed 'Mr. Fantastic'; Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), a hotshot pilot discharged from the military due to misconduct, also known as 'The Human Torch'; Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny's sister and also scientist, dubbed 'The Invisible Woman'; and finally Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed's right hand man later dubbed 'The Thing.' As the freshly named 'Fantastic Four' plan their next move, they all begin to learn how to best use their powers individually, which eventually becomes an asset when they are forced to work together to end the madness Dr. Doom has unleashed on the city of New York.There's no doubt when the producers came up with the idea to put FANTASTIC FOUR onto the big screen, they wanted to get the true meaning of 'fantastic' out of the cast. And I think for the most part they did just that, which a few exceptions. I can't imagine picking a cast that would look better than this one, with Young Hollywood heartthrobs Jessica Alba (SIN CITY, HONEY) and Chris Evans leading the pack. Following them was of course Julian McMahon, who many of us know from one of cable TV's hottest shows, NIP/TUCK. And it was Julian McMahon that out shined the rest of this cast, if you ask me. In fact, I'll even go as far to say that there should have been more of McMahon's Dr. Doom in the story, because without Doom, this movie would have literary been lost in space. Yeah, sure, the story probably centered more on the struggles of Michael Chiklis' (TV's THE SHIELD) character, The Thing, but that's part of the reason why there should have been more Doom. So, I'm not sure where the franchise will go from here, but if Doom isn't involved in some capacity, it might not get very far.Any ordinary film based from a graphic novel is going to contain some pretty wild special effects and FANTASTIC FOUR did not disappoint. Some are saying the story gets in the way of the action taking place and I can just about get on board with that, because several times I felt lost within the story. But, I don't think it was enough to deter me from enjoying the film that director Tim Story (BARBERSHOP, TAXI) was trying to show. If anything, there wasn't enough 'show and tell' of the special powers each of the characters possessed. And the only saving grace to that was Dr. Doom and his powers, which seemed to be invincible.FANTASTIC FOUR may not be the best comic-based film of recent memory, but who cares? With a balanced enough story to go along with a good looking cast that seems to mesh well, what else do you need? I think if you try to pick this film apart, you will, but what's the point when the true idea of FANTASTIC FOUR is to simply entertain? Because in the end that's exactly what it did, taking you on a roller coaster ride that didn't stop until the dramatic ending, leaving you wanting more.B+",7,0,1,15 July 2005
Hustle & Flow," Watch this story FLOW
","Remember those classic hip-hop flicks back in the day like BOYZ N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY and how instrumental they were in showing the struggles of growing up in rural areas? Even though those classics and more recent hit's like 8 MILE are not for everyone, they offer up a good story to follow and enjoy. And that's really all you can ask for when watching a drama and reason why the new 'indie' HUSTLE & FLOW needs to be on every movie fan's radar. Because it's not just about the compelling story, as it's about life and how your dreams can be reached if you try hard enough. That underlying story is something we don't often see in movies over the summer and why this film should be praised now and during Oscar time.When it comes to rap music, there are a lot of things that need to take place, but if you have no rhythm, you have no song. In this story, all that rhythm flows through D Jay (Terrance Howard), as he throws out ideas upon ideas of lyrics for rap songs. But, just having talent isn't enough these days, especially for a guy who lives in the tough streets of Memphis. And for years, those ideas would be just that for D Jay, as he made his name as a local Pimp. But, when he ran into an old high school buddy Key (Anthony Anderson), a sound engineer that was also wanting to get back to his roots, a beautiful thing happened. Not only did the two agree to collaborate, but D Jay started to write all his 'ideas' on a pad of paper and the next thing you know the two, along with Shelby (D.J. Qualls), a local musician with a beat machine, are making music. But, it wasn't just D Jay, Key and Shelby; they also enlisted the help of two of D Jay's women, Nola (Taryn Manning) and Shug (Taraji Henson), both of which that were more than willing to do 'something' else, something that had some meaning to it. Having everything he needed, all that was left for D Jay was to hustle his way into the rap business, which you might expect was no walk in the park. But, for D Jay, it's not about how hard or easy it is to break into the rap scene as it was more about fulfilling that dream that no one said he could.I have to admit, when I first read or saw anything about HUSTLE & FLOW, I had no idea who Terrance Howard was. Sure, I had seen him in a couple what I would call 'B' movies, but never really knew what he was capable of on the movie screen. Well, now, not only do I know who Howard is, I know what he is capable of, plus some. It's been awhile since I have been blown away by a performance, but Howard did it and he did it without me expecting it. And when that happens, for some reason, it's just so much sweeter. His nonchalant nature makes everything he does on screen real, which allows the audience to believe and be a part of the emotion his character is going through, a characteristic worthy of Oscar praise. And that nature can't help but rub off on the rest of the cast, which included Taraji Henson, D.J. Qualls and Taryn Manning (8 MILE), who gave more than an admirable performance as Nola. But, then there was Anthony Anderson, who most people know as that 'other' funny guy in recent comedies. Anderson (CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE, ROMEO MUST DIE), who makes his days now working on FX's THE SHIELD continues to show his dramatic talent, which is almost a blessing in disguise, considering just how stupid some of the comedies (KANGAROO JACK, SCARY MOVIE 3) he's been in were.It's been awhile since director John Singleton has graced us with this type of film, and although he was just the producer, I must say it was worth the wait. HUSTLE & FLOW has everything in it that made previous Singleton films BOYZ N THE HOOD and HIGHER LEARNING so popular and loved, which is why first-time writer/director Craig Brewer deserves all the credit in this one. I don't know, when I think about stories like this, I think John Singleton has to be behind the camera, so for Brewer to be the director speaks volumes of how great of job he did. Like Spike Lee and John Singleton have done for years, Brewer was able to bring all that raw emotion into the story that you can't help but be a part of. And seeing this new Brewer/Singleton 'joint' reminds me how much I miss movies like this and how I wish we had more of them throughout the year. It's films like HUSTLE & FLOW that can't help but make you a fan over and over again.There's no doubt that most people won't see or even here about HUSTLE & FLOW until it's too late, unless of course, it experiences some of that NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE 'word of mouth' mojo. But, either way, this film is every aspect of quality and should be seen by anyone with a pulse. If it wasn't the tremendous performance by Terrance Howard, it was the raw shots of the streets of Memphis behind the story taking place all combining to make one of this year's best. After watching this film, you can't help but walk away from the theater singing 'Whoop That Trick!' A",9,0,1,12 August 2005
Cinderella Man," A sleeping 'Cinderella?'
","I don't know what's more impressive; the fact that Russell Crowe keeps reinventing himself in every new role he takes on or the fact that Ron Howard is coming into his own as a great director. Several years ago when Howard and Crowe teamed up for A BEAUTIFUL MIND, they walked away with an Oscar for Best Picture. That's pretty impressive and hard to top, so what would be their encore? I think that question was answered with the release of Cinderella MAN. With all the summer blockbuster's taking over the box office these days, a small film like Cinderella MAN might get overlooked. But, that will be a big mistake in my mind after seeing this powerful story up front and personal. Not only is this film the sleeper of the summer, it might just be the best film of the year when it's all said and done. That might be jumping the gun a bit, but I guarantee if this film was released during the Oscar push later this year, it would be nominated for Best Picture. That's how good this film was and how much of a mistake it would be to pass up the opportunity to see it.I think by now most people expect a great showing by Russell Crowe and I would have to agree. To some people, Crowe should be the only actor picked for epics, but it's not the epics that define him. It's the roles like the one in A BEAUTIFUL MIND and now Cinderella MAN that truly show how amazing he really is. He brings such natural emotion and reality to his roles that you forget you're watching Russell Crowe. The audience felt every step of his journey which can be attributed to Crowe and director Ron Howard. But, that journey spilled over into the rest of the cast and they too were amazing, as most are opposite Crowe. Leading that group was of course Renee Zellweger, who I must say was impressive as Mae. I think maybe the Oscar for CHICAGO she received a couple years ago wasn't as premature as I originally thought given how powerful she was in this one. And then there was Paul Giamatti, who once again produces a great performance worthy of praise. Giamatti (AMERICAN SPLENDOR, SIDEWAYS), who played Braddock's manager Paul Gould, continues to make his mark in Hollywood and I would bet there's an Oscar waiting for him in the not too distant future.Given the fact that Cinderella MAN appears to be yet another 'hero' boxing flick, I would bet most people would steer clear of this film. But, that would be a mistake in my mind after watching this story unfold. Not only did Ron Howard bring in the perfect actor to play Jim 'The Bulldog of Bergen' Braddock, but he was able to carve out an original look at this famed story that frankly many people don't know about. This movie wasn't as much about boxing as it was about life and how tough it was during the Depression and how one boxer gave the whole nation hope. And, all throughout his film, you weren't thinking about boxing, you were focusing on the life of Braddock and what he was trying to do for his family. That's the heart of this story and why it's different than previous boxing-driven films like last year's MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Now, the boxing action in the ring was true to any other previous films, but Ron Howard was able to balance that into the story so that you were right along with Braddoock, every step of the way. It was that emotion that drove the film in and out of the ring, which is to Howard's credit and why he is becoming one of the best director's in Hollywood.It's a shame that Cinderella MAN wasn't released closer to the fall, given its Oscar weighted cast and director. Taking a true story and molding it seems to be Director Ron Howard's thing these days and I would have to say he's pretty darn good at it. Unlike previous boxing flicks, this film manages to keep the focus away from the ring and produce a story that will surely have you talking days after you see it. Cinderella MAN may not be able to compete with all these other summer blockbusters when it comes to box office numbers, but those same blockbusters won't be able to hold a candle to the quality this film possesses.",9,0,0,15 July 2005
The Island," This ISLAND is no mirage
","When is comes to sci-fi shows on TV, I usually turn the channel and watch something else, but a sci-fi flick is a totally different ballgame. Where TV can only go so far, movies take it to the extreme, which is why I have adored films like MINORITY REPORT and THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK in recent years. It's these blown-up sci-fi/action flicks that really get the blood pumping, because it's not just an ordinary action flick. There's usually a fairly compelling story to go along with it, which makes for something fun and intriguing to watch on the big screen. That's what gets me into the theater to watch and why films like THE ISLAND are successful in my book. The reality to any sci-fi flick is the fact that it is far-fetched and probably unlikely, even though it is set so many years in the unknown future, but that's exactly the reason why sci-fi films make money and create a fan base. And for that, I always look forward to a new story that will most likely blow my mind, good or bad. So, before you get on the bandwagon of bad reviews and press for this film, take a step back and just watch. Because it's not about the unreal special effects or action sequences, it's about the innovative story that makes you think and wonder 'what if?' Usually when it comes to most sci-fi flicks, the cast isn't the most important piece to the puzzle. But, after watching THE ISLAND, I have to give the producers and director Michael Bay credit for casting Ewan McGregor. I think if nothing else, this story needed someone that could pull off acting cool under pressure, but still seem distant from the truth that was going on around his character. McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, II, III, BIG FISH) does that and does it well, showing that Scottish swagger that has made him so popular in films like this. But, McGregor did have some help in Scarlett Johansson, who not only is beautiful to look at, but is also cool under the collar, showing off that innocent yet confident nature that made her Jordan Two Delta character the most fun to watch throughout. And seeing Johansson (LOST IN TRANSLATION, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING) let loose and kick some butt was neat to see and something I would have liked to see more of in next year's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3, which she was slated to be in before pulling out several weeks ago due to production delays. But, I guess for now we'll give her 'props' for this role and McGregor too for a job well done in a film where acting traditionally takes a back seat.As expected, the special effects and action sequences in THE ISLAND were pretty insane to watch. In fact, I would go as far as to say they were some of the best I've seen in recent memory, which doesn't by any means belittle WAR OF THE WORLDS or even FANTASTIC FOUR, but the action and special effects in this film were a tad different. The trick with THE ISLAND is coming up with action and special effects that carefully hover over the line of realism, and for the most part director Michael Bay did that. Sure, the principles behind the effects might be a bit far fetched, but the action that unfolded was just as fun and real as the action sequences that made both of Bay's BAD BOYS films so popular. But, the trick to this film was the molding of Bay's action to the story, which I must say, was done quite well when it was all said and done. And yes, believe it or not, there was one scene that pushed the envelope of realism, but that's what makes Michael Bay unique. He manages to throw all the action he can into one scene and still make 90% of it believable, a feat few directors attempt.THE ISLAND may not reach stardom like it's close predecessor and classic LOGAN'S RUN, but the pure combination of intense action sequences and a story that makes you think works well. Going in, I really didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with a film that was not only fun to watch but also engaging at the same time. So, despite some flaws here and there, overall THE ISLAND is the most detailed work to date for director Michael Bay and a film I would recommend seeing if for nothing else the pure entertainment it oozes of.B",6,3,6,12 August 2005
