Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Thoroughly entertaining!
","The current top review for this movie talks about various American issues that supposedly exist, that it 'reveals' something... oh f*** off with such nonsense. You missed the whole point and so did everyone else who thinks so.The movie has a DELIBERATE 'documentary/diary' angle to it as to portray that what happens there is 'real'. Trough this supposedly serious setting the dark humor shines even more - showing Borat as an anti-semite, Americans as some hicks or just racists, that he is 'unintentionally rude' and what have you... which all adds to the total obscenity that makes this movie the entertaining dark comedy that it is. And in it all that naked hotel room scene and other (pick your favorite!) are just the icing on the cake.All in all the movie does a very good job being an absolutely disgusting, rude comedy, and for those that like this kind of thing it will certainly have an appeal just like 'Brüno' and 'The Dictator'. Sasha Baron Cohen follows trough in those movies much the same way he did with Borat, without ripping off anything or recycling old jokes. I think his approach to all these movies is the fact that slowly but surely the audience of ANY entertainment gets numbed by copycats, reboots, remakes, re-everything... so to construct this movie he had to use a tank instead of a hammer, and that's the point: something new, something totally obscene to spice up the already present originality and ultimately that all boils down to first- rate entertainment somewhere down the line.",8,3,4,5 April 2016
The Maze Runner," boring
","The best way to describe this film with one word is 'boring'. bad actors, plot full of holes, a lot of plot elements are plain stupid, all the 'action' scenes either lack enough logic or are simply cliché. If you are expecting anything NEARLY as good as 'the cube' you will be in for a disappointment. Although the movie shares a similar concept the boring to death actors and the complete absurdity of it all bury all viewer expectations way before the end. And what's worse most of the movie is pretty much a soap opera. Yet another Hollywood sewer dump for the teenage audience, and I frankly don't see this garbage being anywhere near a blockbuster even with the less intelligent crowd. The movie does have potential, but the director doesn't. Like, at all.",2,9,19,23 September 2014
The Hunger Games," Just another summer flick
","I give this one a 'honest 5'. The plot is full of holes and the storyline just does not make sense. I am a bit confused at the target audience here - the boy&girl love story probably makes this movie a chick film, yet the brutality somehow makes it lean towards action/summer movie category making it more of film for mature audience. My major problem with this movie is the idea of such 'games' as well as the existence of 'districts' that seem to be like native reservations and/or feudal work farms vs the big cities that lack nothing. Too little is done to elaborate on the pretext of the plot, rather some glamorous and for the lack of a better word 'fake' characters are introduced and that's it: show's starting, 'this is it'. The current rating of 7.5 is just beyond me... Not bad, but not good either. OK camera-work, just fun enough to make one watch till the end but otherwise nothing special.",5,0,2,11 August 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," A blur between science fiction and fact
","I like the basic idea of this movie, in great part because I always fall for the apocalypse/post-apocalypse genre. Freezing over isn't exactly my kind of thing but I gave it a shot. Biggest problem I have with this movie is that is is just partially based on science and had a lot of it's potential sacrificed to sci-fi just to get it enough 'action packed'. If one looks carefully at movies like Threads or The Book Of Eli the movie portrays other people as the main enemy, rather than the elements as in this movie. Real apocalyptic movies are perhaps 70% about chaos and the collapse of society, and the rest goes to the elements that create it. I guess riots, cannibalism, murder for food and heat was not really how Americans would like to see their peachy society in the 'apocalypse of their dreams', so then the conclusion is - skip this flick, watch Mad Max or Waterworld instead. Perhaps with the post-apocalypse genre being pretty much well defined, the apocalypse genre is stuck between 5-pounds-of-makeup-on-their-faces-hollywood and a dark abyss that is the world after the disaster. Perhaps filmmakers haven't figured that part out yet. Despite the chill, it's a summer movie at its best (or worst): not to be taken too seriously, and not being rated as high as some people think.",3,0,2,21 August 2012
Interstellar," Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA
","I am wondering if the people who write 'intertstellar' 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, 'complicated' love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to 'up the ante'... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) 'LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!'. OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic 'shuttle', WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it 'just so happens' there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The 'machine' that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!",1,203,445,13 November 2014
Predator," Oh, you action-filled 80's!
","A true action classic of the 80's.Over-the-top super-masculine personalities, bloodthirsty gut-ripping alien, suspense and horror, some drama and a climatic ending - this movie has it all. Not perhaps a 'regular' Arnold movie, but one of the best by far. The 'actors' are like coked-up bodybuilders, the scenes are over the top, and the killing scenes are like a first person shooter with 'god mode' turned on. BUT - this is exactly what this movie is about. Pure, first class show, as advertised.If you just so happen to get the gag reflex watching some or other 'transporter' sequel or another modern 'die hard' sequel - sit down, grab a lot of snacks and take a head-first dive into a purely entertaining stress relief that is this movie. Uncomplicated and very entertaining.",9,0,1,17 March 2013
Warrior," Overrated classical American feelgood movie
","First off - great camera-work, hence the 2. Now for the core of the movie - brother vs brother is a fun plot that can be twisted every which way. However as soon as some obviously fake Russian character is introduced with the completely out of place Visotski song playing in the background... the pieces start falling in place. This is a classical American tearjerker feelgood movie. The idea alone of a classic underdog has been made into film 100 times better in Rocky, where not the selfish victory but 'all-in' attempt at it is what really counts. A battle that could not be won, yet one does not give up. This is the opposite. What could have been a very dramatic (and believable! and almost heartbreaking!) plot of two brothers pitted against each other is washed down the tubes. For someone who has a moderate interest in MMA it is clear the the ending was completely unrealistic and would have never taken place. This is not 1900's, today people are not beaten to within an inch of their life in the ring. To contrast this to any VanDamme flick - think of this movie being a much better attempt at a fighter movie, minus actual fighters who have no acting skills, but add to it American superiority complex and you have the 'warrior'. Overrated, and sad to say this 'warrior' won in the ring but lost to idealism.",2,62,136,11 August 2012
Divergent," Et tu, Divergent?
","From the first 5 mins of this soap... I mean 'action movie' I just could not help but think about Hunger Games, and from then on the mind as if tricked by one of these 'now you breathe manually' jokes kept looking for just those parallels. The nearly identical puppy love, dystopian society, excessive for-show violence and a pyrrhic happy end make this teenage girl-oriented flick a girl movie. I expect most of the high ratings come either from girls, or old lonely women, or men who got some great ... lip service... after bringing their GFs along to watch this as a reward afterwards. I usually like the general setting (i.e. dystopian, post-apocalypse) but there's just so much hello- kitty-glitter-spice a cook can put in a dish, and here he dumped the whole shaker in. Also plagued with a kind of soundtrack that would either be found on a teen girl's iPod or in a female oriented 'erotica' movie. Did I say this movie is oriented on teen girls by the way? I can not stress this enough obviously. Even the rivalry depicted amongst the characters... even that is literally a direct copy/rip off from hunger games!I really want 139 minutes of my life back, but I don't think Hollywood does refunds. So, to the concerned potential viewer out there, know this: I sacrificed part of my life on the altar of cinema viewership, quite selflessly I might add, so that you can avoid wasting your time on it. Stay away!",3,6,11,27 June 2014
No Country for Old Men," gritty, slow-paced stab in the guts
","This is what more cinema should strive to be. Instead of a singular storyline and a set goal (classic example: show a hero's rise to power and ultimate battle against evil) this is a kind of casual, slow - but very detailed - look at a set of events. No ultimate decisive ending, no final victory for the good or bad, no climax. The closest thing one can compare this movie are some very few people who can manage to tell a story without raising their voices, without any added drama, and with a calm and steady storytelling still manage to raise every single hair on your back. This is the exact same thing, done with trough a movie. Both the storyline and the actors and the camera manage to calmly but surely portray this with great skill.",9,1,1,8 January 2016
Saving Private Ryan," Cheezy feel-good nonsense
","I some times wonder if Spielberg is one of those contributors to modern anti-semitism in the sense that everything he does is so incredibly cheezy, so old-school outdated cinema style with all that long, soggy melodrama, those tell-tale 'musical effects' or whatever one calls that ambient background music that changes along with the scenes in the movie... this is funny because one can GUESS without looking at who's the director by just listening carefully 10-20 minutes into the movie that Spielberg is the director... it's literally that obvious. I am not sure if 'Uncle Zoid' from that one Futurama episode was a deliberate satirical stab at Spielberg or the same kind of outdated directors as he is, but that one episode summed it up perfectly. Anyhoo..... Unlike the Shoah cash-cow 'Shindler's List' which was made with such severe historic digressions that even Shindler's actual real life family complained about it - in this movie Spielberg takes on what is possibly one of the best paying gigs in the entire US-viewer oriented genres of movies: feelgood American war heroes. Not just that, but in the finest way possible; as in a handful of guys take on half of Wehrmacht who are of course complete morons who have no idea how to shoot straight... and the main aim of their heroic K/D ratio of 100:1 in the movie is... *US patriotism intensifies*... to save a private who's already advanced very far in the war, because Uncle Sam said enough of his family members died. Ugh... And while U-Boot was the antithesis of this movie in absolutely every regard, Spielberg took no notes what so ever. The same way how USA today makes up historical drama about what it did or did not do, the same way does Spielberg make movies.So all that being said, if one is not as critical then the movie is 'okay'. Good enough entertainment if one closes an eye and does not think too hard. But it's eons away from other war movies that do not depict war the same way Die Hard depicts hostage situations.",5,4,8,12 April 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," We are back down that Tom Cruise road again...
","OK first off every time I see Tom Cuise in connection with anything, even so a movie, I just instantly imagine him saying 'I am an OT level 9 and I will ace this thing'. The actor is just boring and as featureless and cheesy as a frozen pizza and as cocky as he was back in Top Gun. I'm guessing if Arnold was the choice of great action movies for his accent, overly masculine features and brutality of character then Tom Cruise is like the quirky idiot, like Jim Carry just that he does understand that he is not funny in any way and should just quit showbiz once and for all. As far as the movie goes - don't really want to waste words: classic rivalry, an antihero woman and a love affair, a stock 'scary horrible super-alien' with a twist, and the whole movie just wreaked of Groundhog Day and some indiscernible hints of Starship Troopers and Terminator V. And of course one-liners and almost toilet-humor level jokes. If you want to kill braincells and lower your IQ, this movie is right down your alley of boring action movies.For what it's worth the CG was good, but that's a given with such a budget.",2,18,54,8 June 2014
Prometheus," What a ripoff!
","First off I give it 3 out of 10 and that is ONLY for being a kind of prequel to Aliens, but for the rest the movie does not measure up to anything. The good and interesting part of the movie is the actual contact with an intelligent alien, but that contact is so short that it might just have been the whole movie - all 15 seconds of it. Now for the bad part: the movie like many recent flicks is over-hyped. Prometheus brings nothing new to the table: a crew of misfits and egoistic idiots which eventually leads to infighting, 80% of the movie taking place in 'dark spooky caves', scary moments and a lot of searching with flashlights (I guess in the future a hand-held flashlight is as far as technology is capable of evolving), slime on the walls and secretive alien writings on murals, random alien creature attack and (of course) a triumph of (relatively speaking) technologically backwards humans against a super-intelligent alien. At one point the filmmakers just got so lazy that one alien was almost like a cobra without a head that has a strange resemblance to a male genitalia and another was just a plain old squid, I kid you not. They might have thrown in a bat and a spider for good measure, would be equally absurd.If you are a sci-fi fan, you will probably manage to link 90% of everything found in Prometheus to another movie. This kinda reminds me of Cabin In The Woods - just like that movie Prometheus manages to suck itself like a leech to a number of different other movies 'borrowing' them dry of ideas. The actors are boring and most lines predictable, so that also adds to the staleness of the movie. I was expecting at least SOME fresh ideas, but this movie is a letdown plain and simple. The best way to describe it would be if one can imagine opening a very old can of soup with a brand new label. Contents are stale, and the 'novelty' of it is just the label alone.",3,3,8,24 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Fall from grace
","I loved the previous two Batman movies, but this one was just boring. The storyline picks off where the last movie left off but there is a gap - the 'fall' of Bruce Wayne is not explained enough. My worst fear was when I heard that the Catwoman was to make an appearance, that it would be clichÃ© - and thank God that did not happen, instead a very subtle introduction and she wasn't too involved in the action so that just added to mystique of her character. What my problem is with is the plot: yes, the movie could not just be 'reinvented', but the League of Shadows? AGAIN? OK, but what about the over-the-top plot of people working for the same League that put a value of 0,- to their own lives? This just adds to the sci-fi part of the movie. Just difficult to digest such senseless idealism. Batman himself was also a kind of hero on the edge of retirement, but I guess that's OK. Also the cops seemed to be in a completely unrealistic situation - in tunnels for a long time... and still 'ok'. I have a very hard time putting this into words - but this movie was actually boring. It's still good, but somehow they just lost the atmosphere of the previous two movies.",6,2,6,11 August 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," NOT the Batman and Superman you know
","What was so magical about all latest Batman movies is that the characters (heroes, villains, whoever else) were introduced in a very subtle way, leaving much to be unknown and up to the viewer to guess (hint: Joker). Cat Woman with that scene where she flipped her goggles up and her silhouette finally *appeared* to be that of a cat's head... that scene alone was so refined... so subtle yet bold... was just very striking. Same with the storyline - little twists and turns, drama when needed but never over the top capitalizing on a film noire styled slow but certain plot development that does not jump head-first into action. This movie does the same to some extent, but less film noire and more action. Good action though. Furthermore the Batman and Superman characters are now anti-heroes all the time pretty much. And yeah, they fight as the name suggests. That's very confusing to say the least, IMHO they should never have mixed the 'two worlds' in that way. Add to that the fact that they do give off a much more generic atmosphere than they did before... But... the action was decent, and somewhat new, and they did kinda manage to squeeze an absurd plot on to the screen without it making and impression of being totally stupid. Just a little stupid maybe. All in all as far as being a thriller/action movie - yeah, it did the part. Just don't expect the same kind of film noire madness that Batman movies capitalized on.To be honest I was most afraid of Ben Affleck not being able to play Batman's role right... well, he actually did it quite well, but then again this is NOT the same Batman as in the Batman movies. A kinda important plot hole though is that guy that played Alfred - well he was literally so young when Bruce Wayne was fully grown that they could have been brothers. Should have gone for a much older looking actor IMHO. So the movie has some small mistakes, but they are far apart.Overall and enjoyable movie.",6,2,6,1 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: recycling of old plot awakens
","Wow, Disney, way to kill a franchise!The movie has none of the general 'feel' of all previous SW movies, and makes Episodes 1 trough 3 looks like masterpieces. At least in those episodes there were focus points for the disappointment (Jar Jar, Anakin's romance etc). Here it's the whole thing that's flawed: the entire movie is basically one giant patchwork of plot snippets from all other movies, the whole mystique surrounding the jedi has been turned into a happy little boy and girl adventure, while the sith are now apparently nothing more than raging teenagers caught in slightly post-pubescent characters who fail miserably. Apparently the dark side now recruits among casting failures, as does the light side. The plot is weak, lame, and often predictable and as many people point out a recycled nonsense. I sense a disturbance in the general Hollywood genre that is the re-cycle and re-hash of both old actors, old one-liners, old everything! Oh and the acting is pretty bad. The main character is basically the 'I am slightly confused, scared out of breath guy' who is literally like this throughout the movie not just in this one part like in the trailer. You'll get bored less than a 1/4 way trough the movie, and about half-way you'll see the cliffhanger coming. I am guessing the target audience are older people with nostalgia and young kids that they eventually drag along to see what they *think* is a good continuation of a cult classic. In that case you are bad parents, and your neighbours should call the CPS.For the lack of a better analogy - this franchise is like Apple. Once Steve Jobs (George Lukas) was gone, so was the vision and guidance. This movie is literally the cinema equivalent of that ridiculous tumor-looking battery case for the new iPhone: looks to be an authentic brand part, but is a complete nonsense that should never have seen the light of day.",2,43,59,20 December 2015
Cloud Atlas," A mess!
","I have not read the book it's based on, and thank God for that, because I can stomach fiction in the 99% of all cases trough cinema only.This 'movie'... oh where to begin. The storytelling as countless other people here said - is absolutely wrong. It may perhaps have helped if this was a series rather than a single full feature length movie, but what's done is done. This interweaving nonsense... just confusion and nothing else. Some movies like Mememento and series like Lost get the concept just right - show something provocative - answer one question and ask two more - but answer at least one of those rather SOON because either impatience will repulse the viewer or the basic fact that a human brain in not a multi-core processor, and can most often times think only of one subject. Unless you are a multitasking-expert female secretary type... which by the way makes me imagine the plot/script was either written by an overly creative woman or a male artist who just does not understand how to tame his creativity to a level it is barely digestible - yet spicy enough to provoke interest.The next big flaw is that due to these million stories that have to be told 1 minute at a time, to tell them all takes too long. And no - I have nothing against long movies as long as they are long not by NECESSITY but by design! I would have more fun watching a marathon of Billy Mays commercials than watching this flick. Oh and yes - the damned narrator. I wonder if that was the plan all along to have his boring old voice babble on throughout the movie in a faint hope that at least that way there would be SOMETHING that would tie the plot together! Ha ha ha!The plot itself is indeed a bit stock, and yes of course all modern Hollywood trends and 'popular' culture does feed very much into this movie, which is another reason to thumb it down. Many characters are of course waaay over the top, which is of course one of the pillars of modern popularist filmmaking.What else? Oh yes, learn how to tell a story, before you release a horrible miss-mash. This is like throwing a three-course dinner into a mixer and being a self-indulging 'intellectual' type, drinking this horrible mix while having a fake ear-to-ear Ponnochio smile. The people who give it 10/10 are just like that - full of themselves, full of their flawed admiration of an overrated piece of trash that will be forgotten as fast as the next summer action flick.",2,4,12,17 March 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," A horrible mish-mash of almost every horror/slasher genre
","I grew up with 'classics' such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, Christine, Bad Taste, Phantazm etc. Even before my time audiences were treated to original movies like White Zombie, Dracula etc. Always something new always something of a muddled lens of the camera trough which director managed to have all of his creative shine get trough. It was back in the day when budgets were very tight an imagination of the writer/director had to account for a movie's success. Here however the movie not only goes trough a cliché routine of establishing this 'just your average all-American teens' characters, but steadily strolls (or trolls perhaps?) trough all known horror genres really chewing trough pretty much every trick in the book. We are talking of a really low level here, no creativity what so ever. The part where my gag reflex went off was when I saw a very badly CG animated 'eagle' fly above a steep cliff side. From there on it just rolled downhill. Almost every scene was predictable, the plot with a few exceptions had surprises in it and I give it a rating of 2 stars for making me laugh when I saw a unicorn impale a man. That was about the only part of the movie I enjoyed. The ending makes no sense, I am almost surprised they didn't rip that off any other movie... but I might be mistaking. IMHO the horror movies work best on kids and young adults. Not much can scare a grown person, but every once and a while come movies like Saw (NOT to be confused with its useless sequels) that makes the audience not only scared, not only sick to their stomach but also give a grand finale in the end that makes everyone scratch their heads in disbelief. This movie did none of that. I guess the high ratings come from either kids who are not critical of it at all, or people who just have no understanding of horror movies.",2,5,12,21 August 2012
The Martian," boring survivalism
","I didn't expect much, and that is perhaps the only aspect of the movie that did not disappoint.You ever get the feeling from a movie or a series that given the plot - that the setting could be just about anything? This is exactly the case with this movie. It could have been set on an island, on a remote mountain top, in a desert right here on Earth... literally anywhere. There is so little Mars- specific in the plot (or rather focused on the fact that this is another planet... something that should have been much more capitalised on) that the whole survival thing could just as well have been about a guy stuck in a service elevator in an abandoned hotel after his coworkers accidentally shut off the power for the whole building on their way out. As for the rest of the plot-specific action going on... meh. A lot of 'video-diary' stuff, Matt finds poop to grow potatoes, Matt does something to survive and something happens because of that, Matt tries to keep himself busy with some other nonsense, Matt talks to himself because he's so alone and a bit nuts because of that, Matt does some McGuyver stuff to survive/communicate/whatever... that's just it there is so little excitement about the plot it basically revolves about mundane routine with some halfway-decent slapstick humor every once in a while there is not much to tell. I was almost expecting some serious plot twist/aliens whatever to come crashing in and turn it all around but that never happened. As far as the rest of the characters go some of them over-played and over-exxagerated their roles, while the rest were just stereotypical characters that needed no character building and didn't get any either. The only thing that kinda spiced up the drama was the rescue effort, but again by that time the movie was already as blant as one of those bad dished Gordon Ramsey gets so disgusted with on his show. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be exactly, an experiment with how boring a one- man survival thing can become or something like that, but it didn't even get CLOSE to what a good movie 'cast away' is. My 2 cents worth of advice just forget about this movie and watch Cast Away.",2,28,63,8 October 2015
