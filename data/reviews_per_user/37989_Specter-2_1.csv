Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Works well with Star Wars formula
","I loved the Phantom Menace and can't wait to see it again.  I have seen it 4 times already.  Jar Jar Binks becomes less annoying each time so be patient with him.  Finally the Jedi were presented in their glory.  They made use of 'Force Speed' when fleeing the Destroyers at the beginning and 'Force Jump' in the castle's core from catwalk to catwalk.  The Podrace was amazing as was Darth Maul whose music when he was on Tatooine was very cool.  The whispered 'hachacha' sounds where cool.  He really should have been in the movie more, or not died yet.  He could have been used as an incredibly evil character who killed with no questions.  The queen was perfectly done and Miss Portman did a fantastic job playing a fourteen year old, although I don't recall fourteen year olds being so.. developed if you know what I mean.  The introduction between R2 and 3PO was also great!  Fantastic experience, too bad it's 3 years 'til Episode 2.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
