Requiem for a Dream," Requiem For A Dream brings the statement 'The road to Hell is paved with the Best of Intentions' sharply into focus
","There are very few films that exist that leave the audience emotionally devastated as they leave the theatre.... Requiem For A Dream is a condensed reality brought alive throughout the medium of film via Hubert Selby's novel, Darren Aronovsky's exceptionally capable direction, the stunning performances by each of the characters and Clint Mansell's hypnotically beautiful yet sorrowful score. The film's incredible power comes from the sheer beauty and in some cases, naivety of the characters. Their choices, despite being filled with hopeful aspirations, lead each to their own personal hell and self-destruction. The tragic ironies that each character encountered in terms of their past and in terms of there present reality, left Me emotionally pummeled as a viewer. At some points, it was almost unbearable to watch (not that I looked away). If ever there were an anti-drug film to deter future users, this would be it. This film is a must see for every individual, no matter from what walk of life.... even if you are not a film goer. I will not call the film a piece of art outright (although it is certainly that) but rather a piece of brutal reality polished and mirrored in the art form of cinema. I extend My warmest thanks to the creators and distrubutors of this film. It is films like these that give Me the hope that even though the quality of films these days have degenerated somewhat, that something somewhere went right in creating and bringing this work to audiences worldwide. To finish up this review I will borrow the words in agreement from the previous reviewer and state that Requiem For A Dream is incredibly powerful cinema.",10,1,2,4 February 2001
