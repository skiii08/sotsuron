E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Probably the best film of all time
","Shot from child height so that we look up at the adults.  The people chasing ET carry keys not guns.  These two details show the brilliance of this film.The children accept ET where the adults react with fear, hostility and the desire to control (hence the symbolism of the keys).Contains the magical dialogue:'...we're helping him to get back to his spaceship''Can't he just beam up?''Don't be silly - this is reality!'I still cry every time I watch the scene where ET comes back to life.  This film is a true religious experience.",10,1,2,26 March 2001
Aliens," The best female action hero shows the guys how to do it
","This is a rarity - a sequel that's better than the original.Sigourney Weaver shows all the male action hero's how it should be done by adding sensitivity and commitment to the role, the ingredients so sadly lacking in macho 'grunt' movies like Rambo.There are so many great scenes, but especially the sequence where she goes back into the abandoned complex.  In the lift (alright then, elevator) she strikes a pose before setting out - awesome.And what a great understated performance from Michael Behn, surely one of the most underrated actors of all time.",10,1,2,28 September 2000

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fantastic adaptation - visually stunning.
","My favourite part was when the staircases changed (Simon age 7).We went as a family and we were all very impressed.  There is nothing wrong with the acting, it is uniformly good and neither is there anything duff about the special effects, in fact they are excellent and the result is a delight to watch which has a 'magical' atmosphere. I give it 10 out 10.",10,1,2,10 November 2001
Shrek," Both me, my wife and our children loved it.
","My favourite characters are Shrek and the talking donkey (Simon age 7).
Both our children (who are 7 and 5) enjoyed this film enormously and it was not merely tolerable for adults but actually good fun.The ending was a delight.",Null,0,0,10 November 2001
