It," Brilliant!
","The remake of the film was amazing! There were some small concepts and scenes missing from the old version (1990) but I guess it doesn't have to be the same. 
You know the scene where SPOILER ALERT Georgie dies? Well there is bonus scene when he survives! There are other scenes like extras (about 11). You need the disc to watch them though. The music was good, Bill who played Pennywise/IT was fantastic, and there is a behind the scenes documentary about it. I think its good, not scary at all for me but don't show this to people who are easy disturbed or children (that's why it's a 15) It is a little bit of a comedy and a mainly a horror. I still yet haven't seen the old film, having heard only the bad info about it, but I found myself on most days searching on Youtube about comparisons of both 2 films or easter eggs etc. The concept of the film was captured through the eyes of Stephen King himself. Having said that, I truly believe it is a film for horror film lovers or similer people to watch.P.S This movie swears, has very small sexual references and LOTS of blood! I now warn you...",10,0,0,21 January 2018
