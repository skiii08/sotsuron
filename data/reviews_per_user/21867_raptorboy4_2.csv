Scarface," Best Movie Ever
","Scarface is a well done, classic film. If you have not seen this movie you must see it ASAP. This movie really does a good job of showing how things were in Miami in the early 80's with the drugs and crime. The movie has an amazing plot that is entertaining from the moment you start watching the film. Pacino is amazing in this movie, definitely his greatest role ever. This movie is by far the greatest gangster type movie ever. I only wish they made Tony and Manny live so there could have been a sequel. Oh well maybe they can make a prequel someday showing how Tony and Manny met and there lives in Cuba before coming to Miami.",8,0,1,19 May 2006
The Dark Knight," Decent
","Wow...Firstly this might be the most overrated movie of all-time. The hype was insane. and putting that aside even. People who saw this movie acted and are currently even to this day calling it one of the greatest films of all-time.After watching this movie, I had mixed feelings. Like most people however I enjoyed it. But here are the problems.. OVER ACTING!! My god! I have never seen such bad mellow dramatic acting in my life. I mean it's a batman movie. You can only take it so far. and this film kills it in-terms of milking every seen. It was like they wanted it to be 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and in order to do that, they just extended the dialogue between characters basically to a point, where i didn't even care what was happening.Bale is a terrible Batman. Give me Keaton any day. That voice? Come on why does he have to growl to speak.and now the Joker. It's a tragedy what happened to Ledger. But people are so blinded by his death, that basically you can't except that his portrayal of the Joker............ is good............. Solid..... but nothing more!!.......... It's not the best portrayal of a villain ever, so quit acting like it is!! He's very tame in my opinion. Not scary, not twisted, not really that evil. For a guy who looks like that, they could have had the character be a bit more violent.People say the scene where he slits the guy's mouth. that it's so terrifying. but You don't even see anything, no blood, nothing. The camera even turns away, all you see is the guy fall. WOW. Like really if you watch the film nothing that crazy happens.Conclusion: Take your blinders off and stop falling for what the media deems as good.People who liked this movie are clones. and the fact that it's in the top 10 on IMDb is appalling.",8,4,8,18 March 2010
