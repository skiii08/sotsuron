","well i like the movie , but there was 3 things that were not good in the film . the 1-st that i don't like is the fact that main character starts to search 1-st the people inside the train instead to watch some1 outside it (or leaving it) - this is not smart , and a normal person wouldn't do it... so it seems fake like that just to make story longer and 'like' the main character is having a big problem finding it . second that i don't like is the fact that the villain leaves only his passport data on the train that explodes - so that means any data will be burned - and what is the point at the end? this is mega stupid and dumb ... really stupid - only for that u will loose like 20-30% of the viewers ...",7,0,1,15 July 2011
