3:10 to Yuma," Poorly done, challenges every sense of reality
","I was stunned at the blatant disregard in this movie for reality. First of all, they treat a serious point blank gun shot wound to the gut as if it were a mere splinter...! I was so disappointed in the way the entire posse managed their deadly prisoner they have I was actually cheering for the bad guy. When I saw the torture scene and one of the posse declare,' You can't do that...it's immoral.' I almost fell out of my seat. The ending is totally unbelievable. The imprint of modern day political correctness superseded what could have otherwise been an excellent film. Revisionist westerns might as well be cartoons for their reliance on the 'plausible impossible'. The only actor to stay fully in character was the kid playing the Rancher's son! The ending of the film was equally disappointing for its absurdity...I wont' go there though...go see for yourself.If you want to compare this film to just about any spaghetti western or to something more alluring like 'Unforgiven' or even a surreal film like 'High Plains Drifter', forget it. '3:10 to Yuma' is just a modern PC liberal's attempt to insinuate the people of those days were something akin to our politically correct and asinine world and is an insult to human intelligence throughout. If you know anything about 19th century Americana circa the post Civil War west, avoid this film like the plague, unless, of course, you are just looking for a good laugh.",3,1,5,24 September 2007
Apocalypse Now," Most just don't get it!
","Reading many of the comments here, I am stunned that I found none who actually got it. This is a film about the study of humanity and what it means to be human. Kurtz is not mad because of the war...he is mad because of what he must do to win against barbarians...he had to sacrifice his humanity and he did it willingly. He teaches us that in order for civilzied human beings to survive an onslaught of barbarians, you have to immerse yourself...defeat your own humanity. And then, when you have defeated the barbarian, you look around...and you are not human any more. In essence, the barbarian wins by forcing this sacrifice on civilized warriors. I left the theater in amazement that such a topic was even thought of for cinematic art. I got it just about everyone else missed it. And I felt contempt for those around me in the leaving crowd who were complaining they were disappointed in the film. They completely missed the point. Now, civilized people are faced again with a decision against barbarians who saw peoples heads off on TV. Will we immerse ourselves and our humanity to do what we must to survive...or will we surrender to the alternative if we don't? Is a surrender to barbarians as bad as becoming one of them? I think everyone should review 'Apocalypse Now' once again because we are about to find out.",Null,24,44,27 December 2005
Meet Joe Black," A strangely fascinating film
","Every time this film comes on I watch it...not because I really want to. But, for some reason, I just can not help myself. It's like not being able to take stop stealing glances at a beautiful woman you see on a bus.I read many of the reviews above and I am taken by how long they are. People are wanting to tell how much this film touched them in a place that is both tender and worrisome. We must all face death eventually. We don't know what that will be like...probably not nearly as traumatic as our birth was. But, we like to imagine we can somehow deal with it....that is, to face it, accept it and then be able to look back over our days and hope we see something there worth leaving behind...that we regret leaving behind as much as Joe and William do. We end up envying them rather than feeling sorry for them. 'Meet Joe Black' is that imaginary inevitable moment in color.I don't think the film is that good in any one specific thing. It is great, though, when all the parts are assembled. It lingers too long...wanting the audience to dread the leaving of it...as the actors do as they portray the characters, savoring, enjoying the last slowly vanishing morsel of flavor from that favorite dish...like lovers tasting and holding and feeling and smelling each other for the last time before a long time apart...like watching the last sunset from the front porch of your home before leaving it for the last time.Yet...in spite of the flaws....the long facials, the continual lingering of it all...I simply can never get this film to leave me alone when it is on. I just have to watch it.",8,2,3,17 May 2010
