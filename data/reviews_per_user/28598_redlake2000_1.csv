Captain Phillips," Should have won best picture 2014
","I have no idea how this fantastic movie didn't win best motion picture at the 2014 Oscar Awards.This was an amazing true story about Somali pirates hijacking an American cargo ship. With mind-blowingly brilliant acting and a really gripping plot, this film was Tom Hanks at his best. This movie had the best acting I have ever seen in any film. Ever.This film was incredibly intense, too! I swear the first time I was watching it, beads of sweat were running down my forehead. Although, there is one thing I didn't really like about this movie. The fact that you know so little about Captain Phillips' life and family. You didn't know anything about him, but if you did you would feel more scared for him and it would make the film even more intense. Well, anyway this was an amazing film. 8 out of 10.",8,0,3,20 August 2014
