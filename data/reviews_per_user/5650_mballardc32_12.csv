Black Swan," Overall Disturbing, Yet Dramatically Unique and Prolific
","Although I can see why Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her role in this, I still do not agree that the hype, stating that this movie is beyond amazing, is correct.The movie is created in a seemingly unique style that makes its home safely in both genres of thriller and drama. There was no obvious holes in the storyline and the movie seemed to flow well. But it is hard sometimes to determine the differentiation between her hallucinations and reality, leaving confused time-lines. The stereotypes used in this moves made the storyline too predictable. The only character that surprised me was the mother. She did not indulge in the common dancer-mother-dictator stereotype overused in most films, which provided me with some relief. Her acting was also one of the highlights. The amalgamation of a determined control freak mother and a caring worried mother. To prove my point, if she was to portray the overused stereotype then she would have forced her daughter to go to the opening night. Probably the biggest moment for her daughter, but she chose her care over her pride and kept her in bed, calling her daughter in sick. Finally the aspect of sexual promiscuity was definitely not needed. It added a sickening feel to this film that made me very eerie. Even though this movie left me feeling rather ill, I acknowledge that their was a dramatic creativity and powerful character movement throughout the storyline. Evident through the bipolar transformation of Portmans character.",8,0,2,13 July 2015
Gravity," Beautifullly Told Story of Overcoming Odds, But Extremely Overrated
","This story was well written. There are a large amount of positives with this film. But this film is shockingly overrated. Maybe its because of some form of film patriotism from the U.S? George Clooney and Sandra Bullock Americas sweethearts. As amazing as they were in this movie there is no way that this should have a meta-score rating of 96 with however many hundreds of awards including 7 Oscars. Fun fact: Pretty well 90% of this movie is animated. I am just in utter confusion as to why people find this amazing. If you want a good space movie about overcoming odds go watch Tom Hanks in Apollo 13. This on the other hand is quite average. With so much focus on the negative people may be wondering why i gave it a 7 out of 10. Well as i said before, there are a lot of positives, most of which are produced by the acting skills of Clooney and Bullock. Nevertheless I don't think i would ever watch this movie ever again.",7,1,4,21 July 2015
Argo," Famous Faces, Exposing Truth, and Authentic Dramatisation
","This movie was the perfect middle point, Hollywood meets CIA. It was intriguing and kept me captivated. Especially since i went into this movie having a high expectation but being very disinterested. Probably because i knew little to nothing about the movie. Due to my Arabic heritage I was immediately engaged in the opening scenes. The fact that the story was based of a true story also captivated me to look into it and give it a chance. The story was all round solid. The casting was brilliant. Famous faces were appearing everywhere, if only sometimes for a little while. They were wonderful actors in simple roles. So much potential, but enjoyed seeing them in it either way. Ben Afflecks acting was blunt and simplistic, but still authentic. Overall a pretty good movie, deserving of a view.",8,0,2,30 July 2015
American Hustle," Directionally and Dramatically Exceptional, But Seemingly Overrated
","The original reason I decided to rent this movie out and watch it, was because of the extraordinary casting and the award nominations and winning streaks. The quirky style of David O. Russell reminded me of what could have happened if Hollywood had of mashed the Godfather with Lincoln Lawyer and Jersey Boys, and got it directed by Baz Luhrmann. The majority of characters were played with a huge amount of talent. Jennifer Lawrence, tho i thought the casting was weird, really did a great job at pulling of a psychotic woman. She frightened me. The casting did however make me feel like Russel had just mixed the castings of The Fighter with Silver Linings Playbook. Loved Jeremy Renner's performance as usual and found that Bradley Cooper came across as bi-polar. Christian Bale plays a character a lot more unique than what i'm used to seeing him in, but still has a lot of similarities to other characters played by him. Amy Adams played a predictable character that didn't shock me at all nor did her performance cause any sense of surprise.I think this movie is overrated. Sure it has a lot going for it but most of that is wasted potential. Still really enjoyed the movie.",7,0,2,17 July 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Cinematic Joyride
","I really enjoyed this movie. It felt like a legitimate action movie experience. Something that a lot of directors have failed to make these days. Knowing that a large amount of the stunts were done by Tom Cruise certified an authenticity of the genre performance. The mix of some animated sequences and gaming styled scenes were suited very well that it added to the experience of this movie. The music was typical spy music and original soundtracks from Mission Impossible the original. There was also reprises of Nessun Dorma playing under some scenes which always lifted the emotional effect of the chosen scenes. The cinematic work was brilliant for an action movie. It really through the audience into the action. Especially during the chase scenes, the camera work was invigorating. The dramatisation was brilliant with a good mix of comedy and seriousness. Truly hope that they continue with this franchise a little while longer. Overall a great movie with brilliant, all round, cinematic work.",7,2,5,1 August 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," Intriguing, Authentic and Educational
","Although there personally was a moral unalignment throughout this movie, i still really liked this movie. There were times where I didn't understand how the plot had developed to that point. Another negative i found was that There was almost to much unneeded sexual exposure. Otherwise i found the rest of the film intriguing and educational. especially in regards to history, aids, HIV, medical procedures and medical proceedings. The acting was all round very good. Obviously Matthew McConaughey was extremely wonderful in his role. he brilliantly captured a desperate man whose world was changing for the worse and couldn't do much to change it. Overall this movie was a brilliant drama that was well deserved of its Oscars.",8,2,2,29 July 2015
Lincoln," Well Told, Educationally Relevant, and Oscar Deserved
","For a movie that was a long time in the writing and forming, this film hit the ground running with brilliance. I am an Australian and was captivated in an educational wave of united states history. I learned a lot through this movie. The acting line up and dramatisation skills were excellent. I can see how Day-Lewis won the Oscar for best actor. There were a couple random pop ups of well known actors that showed their faces for a few moments. Tommy Lee Jones was exceptional as usual. The cinematic work done in this film was well structured and presented to portray certain emotional scenes. There was a lot of effort and skill that went into this movie and I applaud the workers. It truly captivates you in one of the biggest law changes of history.",7,4,6,31 July 2015
The Artist," Brilliant Masterpiece and Experimentally Risky
","A brilliant movie. Bringing the film back to its roots created a legitimately respectful movie. A lot of people would struggle trying to watch this movie and i understand where they are coming from. But saying that this movie was a masterpiece. The music was a continuous emotional joyride. The cinematography was old school styled, much like the rest of the movie. The story line is carried well by each character and the feelings and emotions of the main characters are seen and pre- exposed. I really enjoyed this movie and saw the risk that the crew had in making this. They pulled it off as i would recommend this to serious movie watchers.",8,3,8,9 August 2015
The Last King of Scotland," Intriguing and Adroit with Effulgent Dramatisation, But Somewhat Unexceptional
","Director Kevin Macdonald dives headfirst into a committed style of Hollywood documentary visual style. Something that he is comfortable with as seen in 'One Day in September' and 'Touching the Void. ' McAvoy's boyish acting enhances Garrigan's apolitical foolishness and naivety. It reminds me of the Shakespearean style of story in relation to the doctor's catastrophic failings. On a dramatization note, The acting by Forest Whitaker was exceptional and well deserved for an Oscar. He is astoundingly multifaceted and convincing in his role and you can always feel the emotional response on screen, in real life. I think it carried well and although it was well done there were some unneeded sexual scenes that seemed to have little to no relevance and reason to be in the film. The reason i titled it unexceptional was because there was a sense of amateur production that was carried by the acting and story line. It didn't have the whole picture and even the story didn't unravel with completely conclusive results. Overall, I probably wouldn't watch this again. I would like to see maybe the same story line but done much more seriously.",7,0,1,23 July 2015
Ray," Enchanting Acting and Powerful Story
","Taylor Hackford's 15 year vision finally came into fruition with this amazing movie of Ray. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles Robinson in the title role was powerful and moving. It is great to know that Fox had met Ray Charles multiple times and he even got to play piano with Ray. This made Foxx prime for this role especially considering Foxx's piano and singing abilities. The Oscar Awards associated with this movie, i can't recall at the moment how many it won, were well deserved. This movie outlined the career of a great musician from amazing perspectives. It fitted each element of his life in evenly and flawlessly. Drugs, woman, family, music, loss and pain. The amazing genre reach and breadth of Ray Charles career is covered throughout the movie in its display of the amazing music. Country, jazz, blues, gospel, etc. The most powerful scenes to me personally are found at the end of the movie. The last two scenes. Especially the re- connection that Ray has with his past. Overall this movie was brilliant and I would suggest it to many of my friends and family.",8,1,2,27 July 2015
The Queen," Powerful, Yet Bleak
","Such a beautifully conducted movie. The acting skills by the entire cast were amazing. Especially Helen Mirren as the Queen. Her performance was definitely Oscar deserved, as she was given. The other major actor that blew me away was Michael Sheen. Who is always great and committed in what he is in. he is brilliant as Tony Blair and i really wanted there to be more scenes with him in them. Cinematography was quite good with a lot of shots carrying a presence to them. As in, placing us in the setting. Something that a movie that is based on a true story should be doing. The merging of real footage with the movie footage was well done with there being, at sometimes, an uncertainty between the present footage and the used footage. The story-line is bleak and leaves a boring sensation at times. Tho I understand that it is based on a true story and over emphasizing for viewers enjoyment could manipulate the level of truth. Overall a beautifully moving movie.",7,0,0,25 July 2015
Her," Emotionally Exposing and Brilliantly Formed, Though Morally Unaligned
","I went into watching this film with very low expectations. This was due to my knowledge of the movie being placed around the relationship between a computer and a human. Something that i found morally and ethically confronting. As i overlooked that aspect i saw a beautifully constructed story line being told through amazing acting skills. By the end of the movie i was feeling the same pain i had felt when I had lost someone I loved, It had caused an emotional response that had placed me in the characters shoes. Through the unique directing style and brilliant cinematography, through a moral unalignment and beautifully conducted story, this movie has somehow become relatable and unraveled an emotional roller coaster that has received my utmost respect and praise.",8,2,4,21 July 2015
