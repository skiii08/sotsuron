First Man," Can't go beyond being a good biography film.
","It is a film that makes you watch with great expectation but gives importance to the experiences before the trip to the moon, the time spent on the moon and the time before the journey back to Neil Armstrong.Ryan Gosling's great acting, ambience in the Rocket etc ... can be said to be the biggest plus of the movie. One of the best films of 2018, but is it as good as expected? Unfortunately no.",7,0,1,15 January 2019
