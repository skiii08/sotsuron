The Blair Witch Project," One of the best independent films I have ever seen.
",I went to see the Blair witch project because of a couple of friends saying how good it was.  I had never heard of this movie.  Never saw any previews for it.  I didn't know what to expect.  What I got was an entertaining ride. I truly enjoyed this movie.  It was creepy to see these people lost in the woods.  The sounds and the way it was filmed is what makes this movie an excellent horror flick.  The sounds are excellent.  The movie was filmed bad (because the camera movies up and down as the person holding it walks) but that only makes it more realistic since the person filming the movie is supposed to be one of the kids who is filming the documentary. ( not a person trained on how to use a camera.) It all goes along with making it seem like it is a true story.  This has to have been one of the best independent films I have seen since Halloween.  It is a movie worth seeing and I give it 7 out of 10 stars.,7,1,1,26 July 1999
Mission: Impossible II," This is a killer movie!!!
","I was extremely excited to see another Mission Impossible movie since I am a huge fan of the original and there hasn't been one for quite a few years.  I went today to see if it was up to par.  What can I say.  The first 35-40 minutes kind of dragged on.  It was necessary to show it but, it was just to focused on explaining what was going on in a merely okay story.  The last hour is where it really picks up.  It has loads of action, and stunts that would put the matrix to shame.  It is truly an exciting movie and I was so pleased that I was literally on the edge of my seat.  People were ohhhing and ahhhing at just how well done the movie was.  I give this movie 8 starts because of the somewhat dull start, but it still leads to an action fans dream.  Absolutely excellent.",8,1,1,24 May 2000
