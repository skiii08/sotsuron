Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A timeless classic!
","I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, fifteen years ago. I thought it was ahead of its time! The way they combined animation with 'real time' was amazing and, to me, believable. The story line is mature enough to entertain an adult audience, yet the 'toons make it fun for even young children to watch (with supervision). I was so glad to see this finally come out on video! I had to run out and get the DVD right away! It'll be one of our family favorites for years to come!",10,1,1,27 March 2003
