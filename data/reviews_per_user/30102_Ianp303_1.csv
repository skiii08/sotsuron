Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Vethy nice the world of Borat
","The movie Borat is about a man from Kazakhstan who had a dream and that dream was to be famous and marry Pamela Anderson I personally love this movie Sacha baron Cohen did a great job playing his part and so did everyone else the three main events in this movie were humor, foreign, accent over all it was a awesome movie and you should go watch it.Furthermore Borat was the funniest actor I think ever it was all complemented by his accent.Over all just his personality made you laugh he and his friend Azamat traveled the country and have some very funny moments.For instance he didn't know the pledge of allegiance and made his own version of it at a rodeo. You will see a lot more of these moments as you watch this movie.In addition he also had a great accent. His accent was like no other it just made you laugh and the things he would say like 'vethy nice' I personally laughed so hard I almost started crying. Thus his friend Azamat also have a awesome accent but was compared nothing more to Borat the main character. Over all Borat had an advantage in this movie because with out his accent this movie wouldn't as good.Moreover this movie was good but there was a lot of nudity. The nudity was bad and just plane disgusting it showed every thing it made me want to puke but yet the scene was very funny and you got over the fact that they were nude because you were laughing your ass off.Henceforth Borat wasn't from the United States of America but from Kazakhstan. as he showed you his corrupt town in the movie you see lots of poverty but every one there was happy. I think that generated Borats respect and also his humor. Over all from watching this movie I would want to visit Kazakhstan and learn more about them.Comparatively have you ever wanted to visit Kazakhstan? When watching the movie think about how hard it would be to migrate from Kazakhstan to America. To me personally this movie still hasn't been touched by anyone as in ranking still today in 2012.",9,0,1,8 November 2012
