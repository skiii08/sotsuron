The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Pure Bliss.
","As a die hard fan of the book, I have been following this movie ever since it was announced. Every time I had a chance to get on a computer, I would check to see if anything new was announced. Never have I been so excited for a movie. I just got back from the showing, and I can proudly report that this movie exceeded every single expectation I had. Throughout the movie all I could think was 'This is so perfect'. Everything was impeccable. The adaption and directing (hats off to you, Mr. Chbosky, the filming, the acting, everything. None of the jokes were forced and all of the emotional parts packed a serious punch (almost everyone in my group teared up during at least one scene of the movie). Even in the ending I was crying. Partly because it ended so perfectly, partly because the adaption was perfect, and partly because I didn't want it to end. I cannot recommend this movie more. Even to people who have not read the book, go see it, for it is exceedingly beautiful.",10,4,9,30 September 2012
