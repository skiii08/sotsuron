First Man," Bored... slept halfway through the movie
","I know this movie is supposed to be all about historic event, but please... this is also a movie shown in theatre (not in some universities for educational purposes) which also, crucially, importantly, imperatively needs to be entertaining. 10 stars for telling viewers on what happened to the first man who reaches the moon but 1 star for entertainment. Bored myself to death watching this movie !",5,2,5,11 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Extremely Briliant !
","I don't care what all the critics have to say about this movie and how it does not 100% reflect the real life story of the bad called QUEEN - hei... movies are supposed to be entertaining, nobody says this is supposed to be educational.Two thumbs up to all the crews involved in making this movie!",9,2,2,11 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," It's a 10 out of 10
",I am speechless.... This movie is so cool and yet I am sad that this marks the end of the Avengers.,10,1,5,3 May 2019
Hotel Mumbai," A 10 out of 10, at least for me
","Felt that I need to help build this movie's rating. Saw some comments with a one star rating. Read that and felt they are taking this too seriously. C'mon people it's a movie, the goal is just for ENTERTAINMENT. This is not a history lesson. It may not be fair to go around saying there is a loophole in the movie, it's not exactly what happened, it is too soon to release a tradegy, etc., and hence a one star rating.Overall, I had fun watching this movie. There was not even a minute of boredem in this movie.",10,20,49,17 April 2019
