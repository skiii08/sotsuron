The Equalizer," Why the Equalizer?
","I guess the real reason why is the studio still thinks the name 'The Equalizer' still is a draw. While I thought this film was OK. A fairly mediocre action film my real problem with it is its title. As a fan of the show in the 80's I was eagerly looking forward to seeing this. It bares very little resemblance to the show on which it is based. Not that I don't like Denzel, but I personally was hoping for someone that audiences have seen in a role similar to the TV show. In that respect I was hoping for Timothy Dalton. Regardless this film is as I said neither great nor horrible. If you like action films it is worth seeing, but as a fan of the show I just wish they had called it something else rather than getting my expectations up there with what was a fine show for its time period.",7,2,3,19 February 2015
The Equalizer," Not quite The Equalizer I remember
","As a fan of the TV series I was disappointed that this bears little resemblance to it's source material. That isn't to say this is a bad film. In the series Edward Woodward fed up working as an agent gave it up, but wasn't willing to let his expertise go wasted. He took out an ad to help those in need. He occasionally had help for former colleagues. He lived in a nice apartment. Drove a Jag. The very city of New York was almost a character unto itself. The Robert McCall Denzel plays him more like Liam Neeson in the Taken series. 
I guess my big problem is once again Hollywood has taken a property with name recognition. I enjoy this film for what it is, but I would still love to see a faithful adaptation of The Equalizer.",7,0,1,31 July 2018
Knives Out," Hated Last Jedi. Loved this.
","As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre.",8,426,666,1 December 2019
