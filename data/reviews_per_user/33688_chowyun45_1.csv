The Blair Witch Project," A Gem Of A Movie
",I still remember the hype that surrounded this when it was first advertised.Everyone thought it was real including myself.a year later its released and makes millions.Now thats good marketing for you.Only the world were expecting this big great scare and gore fest of a movie.And its far from that.I think people who appretiate movies will love this.Its so cleverly made and thought out.What makes it stands out from the rest is that it relies on atmosphere and imagery to scare you.There are no cheap scares or thrills.Infact we never even get to see the witch.If people could just watch how these characters mentally breakdown  rather then wondering when all the gore is going to happen then maybe it would be alot scarier.It scared the crap out of me.,Null,0,1,16 May 2001
