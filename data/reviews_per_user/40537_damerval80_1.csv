Ford v Ferrari," Fabulous!
","Great acting! OMG! Every actor/actress was on point, absolutely no dull moments! Finally a real story about real people, real super heroes! And real villains! Our family loved it and we've been talking about the most memorable scenes ever since. Well thought out. The movie is genius. More like this please!",10,6,17,15 November 2019
