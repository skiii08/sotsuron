Walk the Line," Big Disappointment
","It would be hard to imagine a movie dealing with the life of Johnny Cash as being a disappointment to me, but this one was. First and foremost, I found it incredibly boring. The movie lacks the pace and interest of other movies of this kind, like Ray for instance. Secondly, the movie was 'all over the place' and made it somewhat difficult to ascertain how much time had passed, etc. Finally, instead of being treated to dolby digital renditions of Johnny Cash, we get 'treated' to the off-key tones of Joaquin Phoenix! Why the director decided to do this is a complete mystery to me. Maybe he wanted to demonstrate how his 'genius' does not depend on a great soundtrack.<ul><li>Jack</li></ul>",3,8,38,19 November 2005
