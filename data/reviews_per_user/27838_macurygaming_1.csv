10 Cloverfield Lane," Really Good thanks to John Goodman
","Honestly, ill admit it. I would make a terrible critic due to the fact that any movie I see in the theater, I end up liking 100%. But I can say that although this movie had its flaws. I couldn't remember them for the life of me as I was mesmerized by the performance by John Goodman. The story itself, I liked... I think JJ Abrams did a swell job at keeping nearly the entire story to a thriller and giving the audience more of an emotional feeling than an action packed one like the original Cloverfield 8 years prior. But John Goodman by far is the best actor in this moment. His Oscar worthy job in this movie made him 3 times as great as the the entire rest of the cast combined. Especially because that cast was two other people. Goodman owned this role even in his antagonist position, and I applaud him for it.",9,1,3,22 April 2016
