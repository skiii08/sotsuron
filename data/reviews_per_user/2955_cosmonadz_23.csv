Iron Man 3," Flat Iron
",After all the hype it's finally here. There have been suggestions that this was the conclusion to the trilogy which is Iron Man! If so you'll be left wanting more. This installment lacked the pace of the first 2 movies but never the less remained on course to be a hit. Tony Stark was up to his usual antics but the movie lacked the edge we are used to it felt like Stark was going through the motions with all too much ease. The twisting plot line wasn't so twisting and the action wasn't up to its usual manic best. Pretty decent performances all round but I can't say it was as good as 1 or 2! Maybe the change of director led to the lack umph who knows. Without giving too much away it does satisfy the keen avid fan of marvels appetite for flying machinery but the script and ending left me feeling a little short changed. Needless to say it will go on to make millions you'll enjoy it but you'll want more at he end.....,8,1,5,8 May 2013
World War Z," Armageddon with Zombies
",The movie centres around the main character Gerry (Brad Pitt) who is a retired UN investigator called back into action after an epidemic breaks out threatening global destruction through a plague. The movie starts off very fast throwing you into the thick of the action with spectacular visuals and sets the foundation to a very interesting story. It almost becomes a fact finding mission for Gerry who is left with the single task of finding the origin of the virus while simultaneously trying to secure the safety of his family. Gerry is sent globe trotting to find the origin of the breakout in order to try and find a cure. As far as a zombie fest goes it falls short of an all out gore type of movie. The action drops off and it almost falls into the 'War of the Worlds' type of pace. For me the end came far too fast and it didn't live up to the manic beginning. Interesting concept never the less and thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The story line is clever and is well acted with locations to match. If you're expecting a big grand final action packed scene then don't. It has a simple end which could leave you wanting more. Again I think this is more of a War of the Worlds but with zombies not aliens. I watched it in 3D but it wasn't really made for that so if possible stick to 2D.,8,5,13,26 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Back with a bang...
",If you loved the first one you'll love the sequel. Given the task of fighting a one man war machine the crew set about their usual tasks of teaming up to combat a united enemy. It starts off at a frantic pace and rarely slows down. The characters are as edgy as ever and the story flows with life. You'll enjoy the dialogue special effects and if watched in IMAX3D you'll particularly enjoy the big action sequences. Although it may not have been shot in 3D the transformation is bad at all. It's full of plenty references to the original movies enough to satisfy all the Trekkies out there. With a few surprising recall of past characters you be more than satisfied on the final product. The acting was bang on and script well developed. It really has left me wanting to see a few more installments as the stories are endless. Unlike many other sequels there wasn't any overkill on trying to please the viewers with dreary dialogue it was catering to a smart audience and was very well received. Well done cast production and director.,8,9,23,8 May 2013
Alien," Suspense Vs Horror
",It doesn't matter how old this film gets its a timeless classic. Ridley Scott has managed to do what most others try again and again and fail. He has set a benchmark by what others use as a template for formula for a true horror suspense. It sees a crew being hunted down one by one through a maze which is the mother ship heading back to earth. With a cast perfectly balanced and an alien on the rampage it's edge of the seat stuff all the way to the end. With rare glimpses of the beast it goes to show that you can leave so much to the imagination and that's what scares us the most. With iconic scenes and a script that moulds the cast giving little known actors golden performances. Throw in a face hunger chest buster android make shift flame throwers and a certain Jonesy it has all the ingredients that makes a classic. Try if you may but really in space no one hears you scream!!!,10,0,1,6 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A fitting end.
","Forget the reviews and forget the critics and forget the upset fans who will never be satisfied look past it all and know that this is a finale for a new generation of fans. Comparisons to the original movies will always fall short. This movie is surprisingly better than expected.
It starts well and the movie flows nicely tying up loose ends and stitching together differing stories. It brings in some missing parts from the first two movies and concludes well. Yes there are still some questions that need answering but there have always been unanswered questions throughout all 9 movies but to say it's doesn't bring the franchise to a fitting end is selling it short. It rounds off nicely and for me it was pleasantly better than expected.
The standalone movies that are planned will no doubt fill in gaps as did rouge one for the original star wars trilogy so expect there to be cross references in the new planned yoda movie and rumoured 3 part obi wan movies.",7,3,6,2 January 2020
Pacific Rim," Pacific DIM
",After all the hype I was left a tad disappointed. OK it was full of action and the big scenes were well big but the acting left it feeling very flat. The story that the world is being attacked by gigantic creatures which required even bigger robots to fight them off was alright but it lacked any sort of introduction the movie just got off with a bang and then constantly grinds forward without any real story. You can think of this as Godzilla meets Transformers but with the acting and story ripped out. The only saving grace was Idris Elba he manages to carry the film forward with a good performance and the big action sequences take care of themselves. It didn't look terribly good in 3D IMAX and I don't think the proportion on the screen was too clever. The picture filled the screen to the bottom but not the top and the images were blurred on the faster sequences. I had expected big things from this film but the acting and story left me feeling a little sad. But on the plus size its an action fest with monsters and machines so not all bad!,6,2,8,25 July 2013
Predator," If it bleeds....
","Action at its best.
Great story brilliant cast and no stupid mid movie plot that goes off on a tangent. This is what action movies should be all about. Great balance of characters mixed with just the right amount of muscle and blood. Thoroughly enjoyable watch.",9,1,1,2 January 2020
Léon: The Professional," Leon deserved an Oscar!
","Luc Besson at his best. This film deserves recognition not only for its director and script but for all 3 lead performances. Jean Reno plays a lonely hit-man , Leon. Cut off from society he goes about doing what he does best. His solitude life is thrust upside down with the introduction of Natalie Portman who puts in an Oscar worthy performance. The two embark on a journey which leads you to feel sympathy for the gun for hire such is his performance. Luc Besson gets it right with the balance of chaos and tranquility and its brilliantly filmed. Lets not forget Gary Oldman who pulls off another powerful performance as the mad bad cop on the warpath. The 3 characters are all fighting their own demons and twine together leading to an action packed blockbuster of a film. You've got to watch the international/directors version to truly appreciate the performances of Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The film explores the bond and love between these two central characters. What you end up with is an action packed film which plays on your emotions. You'll be left emotionally drained by the end but well worth every minute.",10,4,6,6 March 2013
Oblivion," Sci Fi conundrum
",Oblivion is set in the not too distant future and the story unfolds with small flash backs and present time story telling. After a war with an alien race the earth is left in ruins. The start of the film concentrates on 2 central characters but as the story goes along more are added. It had a certain 'Book of Eli' feeling but quickly gathers pace with its plot. I enjoyed the visuals and the story wasn't too weak although it did lack spark mid way through in my opinion the love/emotional storyline does distract from the premiss. Saying this it still flowed along nicely and as it begins to get complex you don't lose yourself in the middle trying to figure out who is what and when!! The end could have been better but so could the end of a lot of good films. You won't be left disappointed as a sci fi fan it touched on all of the things I like best. I would've loved a more detailed history of the alien race but then I guess time can be your worst enemy when trying to cram it all into 2hrs and 10mins. I would suggest IMAX or a larger screen for an optimal viewing experience. Tom Cruise does what he does best and mixes up the action with a touch of romance of plenty of heart. Oscars I doubt it but a worthy performance never the less. Lets hope this is the start of a run of some enjoyable sci fi films set to hit the big screen this summer.,8,2,10,23 April 2013
The Bourne Identity," Bourne tastic
",I really enjoyed the first outing of Bourne. I think it was a coming of age film for Matt Damon and although it isn't his best performance he did prove the doubters wrong. Personally my favourite of the trilogy as the web unfolds and the plot thickens the pace of this action packed thriller just goes from strength to strength. I enjoyed watching the original TV series and thought the movie did a good oh of transferring it to the big screen. I enjoyed how the character unfolds and his balance of emotion and anger are ignited through his confusion. Enough is covered in this opening movie to give you the taste for wanting more but not leaving you bemused. The supporting cast do a decent enough job of carrying Damon through the scenes and even a heavyweight pitches in (Clive Owen)'to lend a supporting hand. Damon almost reminds me of an insomniac 007'but maybe with less suave about him. All in all a good effort and full marks for keeping me entertained. Damon proving himself and making sure that the likes of good will hunting were not just a fluke! The other two movies fit in perfectly and make the whole 3 parts one it satisfying meal of a movie.,8,3,3,6 March 2013
Man of Steel," Superman at its best
",This is the superman that people were meant to see. I thought at first it was going to be another superhero revamped full of gimmicks I'm so glad I was wrong. This version gets deep down into the psyche of Clark/Kal and reveals a side to the character never before explored. From the outset the film fills you with a new version of superman with more depth into his back ground and fills all the gaps previously untouched. Then it does a brilliant job in fitting him into our modern day society. Above all this film shows us a side we all wanted to see. The action is second to none with powerful characters all playing their part. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both filled the screen with magical performances allowing us to see the struggles Clark feels. The burdens and pressures he has to carry and ultimately the sacrifices he must make. The General Zod character again was brilliant and added a darker element to the film. The film flows smoothly and the flashbacks are brilliant in giving us a story from birth to end but filling in the gaps where needed. The new story line is full of life and the action/fight sequences are superbly choreographed. Overall all the characters perform well together and the story line doesn't drag. In the past it has either been slow paced or too corny but this version doesn't suffer these antics. As for the man of steel himself Henry Cavill puts on an extraordinary performance and excels as Kal-El. He plays the character with ease confidence and you truly see the passion in him. Superman is a must watch and if you can get to an IMAX I highly recommend you see it there for all its glory. I also like the way the film was shot with a feel of reality and from the perspective of the characters themselves. This has to be one of the best surprises in a film I have had for many years.,9,26,49,14 June 2013
The Thing," Alien in the snow
",John Carpenter at his best. In an age full of cgi and A-list clutter here is a prime example of how to get it right without going overboard. The story/plot action characters all gel so superbly I don't think a review can justify the end result. It can be labelled a horror sci-fi suspense thriller action movie all rolled into one. Nothing beats the old style special effects not a blue/green screen in sight! The performances churned out by an ordinary cast is brilliant and yes I'm saying it was an almost ordinary cast minus Kurt Russell Keith David (Childs)and possibly Donald Moffat (Garry)but you know what I mean. I remember watching this movie when I was 10 and then I definitely thought horror but as I've watched it progressively over the years each time I find myself classing it as something else sometimes even as a murder mystery! The setting works well and the film never seems to lack pace from a never ending twisting plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. If you've not seen it I don't know what you're waiting for. No really I don't know what are you waiting for go watch it now you won't be disappointed.,10,1,3,26 February 2013
Aliens," A sequel to relish
",One of those rare moments when a sequel is as good as its predecessor. It starts off from where the first one left off (so watch the first one). Here we have Ripley going back to face her demons but this time she is accompanied by a group of marines. In the first installment it was cat and mouse but here it's all out action. James Cameron delivers a fast paced full throttle action packed monster of a movie doing what he does best. A cast full of zest and testosterone but once again coming up against an enemy which is not only powerful but smart. The pace is fast the cast full of memorable characters and again Ripley is left to save the day. This time round we get to see a little more of the aliens and they are just as terrifying in groups as they are alone. Guns flame throwers grenades tanks rockets space ships are really no match for the aliens. But they do try. It's fun and thrilling all the way to the breathtaking climax scene well worth the wait. Thoroughly enjoyable and probably one of the best action sci-fi films ever made.,10,0,1,6 March 2013
1917," Visual Treat
",Brilliantly executed from a cinematography point of view. The story can only be described and beautifully haunting as it takes you on a journey of hope despair grief elation and the bitter truth of war. Set in WW1 it tells the story of a how an almost impossible mission is handed to 2 soldiers to avert a disaster in the front lines. Emotionally draining this spectacular piece of cinema will be most appreciated on the big screen and if possible IMAX is the way to do it.,8,1,2,20 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," So so
",Meandering through the motions leaving you with more questions than answers. Never going to compare to the originals but I guess for a new generation of fans it's not bad as movies go. Was hoping for more airtime with the old cast but I guess eventually you got to let go of the past and move on. Hopefully the final and third installation will have a fitting end to the trilogy.,7,4,13,2 January 2020
Elysium," Sci Fi with a heart
",Elysium is set in the year 2154 and tells of a story of the extremely wealthy living on an advanced space station named Elysium where there is no poverty or disease and the poor live on earth struggling with disease and war. Matt Damon (Max) finds himself exposed to lethal dose of radiation which prompts him to go on a mission fighting death and his frail body to save himself and the only way to do so is to get to Elysium where all diseases can be cured. In his path he comes up against Kruger played by Sharlto Copely who is a menacing mercenary who will stop at nothing to hunt down Max. Without giving too much away the film is brilliantly shot with some deft camera work and great directing. It has a very gritty feel to the movie and shows some signs of Distric 9 although the movie is not as good it's still a very impressive movie. Again highlighting a social problem present in today's world Neill Blokamps vision of the future is put to screen in a very pleasant way with a story that flows and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters gel well together and story doesn't over complicate itself. Sharlto Copely comes up trumps with the guy who just won't go away! Overall a delightful movie with just enough to pass itself off as a Sci Fi.,8,0,2,21 August 2013
Les Misérables," Loud but not Lavish
",Loud is the first thing that comes to mind. I was really let down by this movie maybe I was expecting something completely different but overall was left feeling that this did not belong on the big screen. There were some notably stand out performances but it just didn't seem to quite gel for me. Maybe some of the characters didn't fit in. Someone really needs to tell Russell Crowe that he can not sing whether it was Hugh Jackman singing too well that made Crowe look bad I don't know but it was definitely visible. Th story moved along well but it lacked that extra kick and every time I thought it was about to ignite into something spectacular it would just slow right down again. Cinema in my opinion needs to be cinematic and as my fiend pointed out it just didn't offer anything cinematic the close ups the shaky cam and loudness of certain scenes just didn't sit well. It's a shame because for all the good the movie did show it was quickly put in its place by the poorer elements. I'd even go as far as to say was this a movie at all or was it just one large set after another trying to be a moving piece of dull theatre? Maybe the theatre is the best place for this story and the cinema should reserve the right to be a place for true cinematic art.,6,0,1,29 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Fact or Fiction
",It seemed to me that the movie was trying so hard to stick to fact over fiction but as we all know it takes a little dramatization to put bums on seats. Although the film started off by gripping the audience it did seem to lack a little punch through the middle. It's hard to keep the audience hooked when there is little to offer them in a story that seems to blow hot and cold. Having said this on the whole the details provided in the story line were pretty easy to follow and it was surprising to see the political machine not falling foul of election frenzy. The cat and mouse scenarios were perfectly balanced and although some may argue that they may have been a little stretched out I personally didn't see it that way. The end was a little rushed but I guess it's hard to show much more since most people went into the movie knowing plenty of facts already. It was all a matter what you already know and what you believe to be true. It's one of them movies where how much you know or believe is paramount to what you see in the film and what you are led believe. Enjoyable and full of suspense it's definitely worth a watch. I predict an Oscar winning performance for a supporting woman but I won't spoil anything by saying too much.,8,0,3,29 January 2013
Jaws," Summer Blockbuster at its best
",Steven Spielberg take a bow. This film has it all (except aliens and cowboys). Set in a sleepy summer beachy town terror lurks in the depths. The tempo is what I like best building around unforgettable characters and its display of power struggles from mayor to chief to captain! Suspense at its finest. The 3 pivotal characters are introduced in heir own right and end up walking the same line. The cat and mouse game not only between shark and man but between hooper quint and brody is a delight. Not wanting to get too technical but for a fuller appreciation of the movie I recommend watching the making of the movie too. Back to the film itself the locations and sub story's all tie in greatly to the bigger picture. With minimal effects and maximum joy it's a movie that you'll enjoy watching over and over again. Just as good when I saw it he first time. The standout scene has to be quints speech about the USS INDIANAPOLIS. I've watched this film many times and it always gets my full attention. On my last note who can forget John Williams. Did he make he beast even more frightening the music score is timeless. Most deserved Oscar winning performance. You'll never swim the same again.,10,3,7,26 February 2013
Lord of War," Cage unleashed
",Cage hitting all the right notes in this well scripted movie. Going through all the motions with a great supporting cast to suit. Movie delves into the murky world of arms dealing with surprising twists and turns along the way. Enjoyable watch even if war isn't your thing.,8,0,0,2 January 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Awesome
",Superbly scripted and casted. Stands the test of time. A story based upon friendship perseverance and how one man defied the odds. Sometimes it's best not to read too much about a movie and just allow the story to sink in. You won't be disappointed is all I want to say.,10,0,0,20 January 2020
The Wolverine," Best Wolverine!
","This is the best Wolverine to date. It's fast paced full of action and the story keeps flowing with a few good twists and turns. Hugh Jackman is back to his best with a story following his past present and future. It follows on from an event in Logans past where he is given the chance to have a taste of mortality but obviously at a price. It is mostly set in Japan with stunning sequences and breathtaking scenery. Without making it too complicated the movie flows through the gears and gives a few flashbacks to previous movies. Whereas previous versions have lacked in seriousness this movie maintains a good rhythm throughout. With a good blend of martial arts, samurais, mutants and robots yes that's right robots its an altogether fun action packed film with well directed fight scenes that you'll enjoy immensely. There is a bonus scene for the die hard fans after the credits well worth the wait. Easily watched without having seen any of the previous movies its very enjoyable. Most probably better watched in 2D but I've not had a chance with the 3D yet.",7,2,5,25 July 2013
The Godfather," Masterpiece
",This is the perfect example of how to transform a story from book to script to screen. No derail spared no character left unexplored and no thread of story left unanswered. All the cast performed magically and this is one of them rare occasions when a movie literally outdoes any review. Brando Pacino Duvall Caan all deliver performances of a life time and bring to the screen one of the most powerful portrayals of how the mob is a family and that family is Corleone.,10,0,0,21 January 2020
