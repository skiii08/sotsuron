Hereditary," Not just a horror movie
","This is not just a simple horror movie, it's beyond and turn my mind completely upside down. Mental illness is the main question here, covered by all the devil's stories. If you were looking for a senseless full of jumpscares film, than you'll be disapointed with this one. This film was not made for all kinds of viewers, this is a smart horror movie and one of the best I've ever seen.",10,0,2,25 August 2018
