Skyfall," Very entertaining film
","i just love what they did here. The filmmakers somewhat ignored the traditional formula but still did some great things that is classic Bond which is absolutely great. Bond is shot down buy an agent in accident and is wounded and has to find himself again and hold his own against a very formidable foe. I like how this movie is all about the rebirth of Bond, and its done extremely well. But what makes this movie so damn good is that its just so enjoyable tense and really great action film, although there are things that you can nitpick here and there but Bond rarely gets this entertaining throughout the whole film, its just a blast! and we have some great cast as well, one of my favorite villain in the series played by Javier Bardem and he is having a ball with this role and does it extremely well. This movie also introduces a new q... does anyone feel like we just reached a Harry Potter movie in his first scene? anyways he does great and is absolutely a fine addition to the series, he ain't no Desmone LLewlyn but he is great in this film. Judi Dench and Daniel Craig are a great team in this movie and Dench M gets a great last Bond film. Skyfall is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful movies in the series, you really root with Bond here and you can feel the character.",9,1,5,7 January 2015
Darkest Hour," Worth it for Gary Oldman alone
","This film is drama, nothing else.. imagine Bold and the Beautiful set in war time, basically alot of talk and little play. But the movie thrives on its screenplay with excellent performance by Gary Oldman.And it gets very interesting when Churchill decides to go out and mingle with the people and see their thoughts on the matter. That scene really hooks you in and at least go me thinking wow this scene is amazing.All in all i would recommend this film for history fans and movie goers alike, but don't expect action or a fast pace. Just a nice little documentary about a man who wanted to win a war with well ,,that man''.",8,0,1,23 August 2018
