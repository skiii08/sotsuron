Come and See," Awesome , powerful and brutal.
","Come and See , well if you hate violence and brutality then you certainly wont want to see this. This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever, only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture , is how the director uses a child's perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is.
I dont want to go into the plot , as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film , but when viewing this film , please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening , as you wont sleep.The acting accolades of course goes to the main characters , but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander , who was just simply , superb. Everything about him was what you'd expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks , the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit , and the SS soldier , who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak , after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are sub-human and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men , that they are not just fighting for Socialism , but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you'll have to see.Come and See is nothing short of disturbing, awesome, powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 1941-1945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director. Only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can be put in the same League table.",Null,138,186,20 February 2001
Footloose," Retro-Heaven for thirty-somethings
","At the moment in Britain we are enduring a retro revival of the 80's. Pop Concerts involving Adam Ant , Howard Jones , ABC and that shining glint of quality , China Crisis will be appearing, to kick off another tour dedicated to the 80's. A time in Britain afflicted by the social/political division of Thatcherism and the decay of  long held values that only confused and discarded the generation that was brought forth  in that era of unemployment and greed.The generation that I myself come from , all wince at the events and the backward motivation of our political & social leadership. Instead we hide in that piece of muscical & cinematic period that somehow expressed our desires , our joy and our hopes.Footloose , a very popular film in 1985 , caught in some respects the mood. The need and joy of partying and dancing , to find some joy from the drab , repressive existance that our Institutions in Britain had planned for us all. Footloose , showed a moment involving the Preacher of what is percieved truth & wisdom as what it actually was ignorance and repression. How wisdom , even from the bible can be manipulated and become a weapon designed not to lift mankind closer to god , but to push that which is pure , into the very arms of evil. The book-burning scene showed the Preacher the folly & error of his ways.Kevin Bacon as the rebellious teenager held the film and Lori Singer was good as the wayward teenager , trying to break free from a Preacher Father who suffocated not only a town but also his own family with his predjudices & beliefs.Footloose had a great soundtrack for 80's lovers , music from  Australia as well as the US. Unfortunately , Kevin Bacon's Wren said his favourite band was Men at Work. None of their music was played.Some brutal ommissions and inappropriate songs & music bogged down the general mood of the film. The film however , had its desired affect for the generation I come from. We have the right to party & have a good time. Regardless of anyone or anything.",Null,1,3,18 February 2002
The Patriot," A shameful distortion of history.
","I was in Australia when I first watched The Patriot and again I was fully prepared for a bit of anti-English bashing , because Mel just couldn't resist to give that winning formula up after Braveheart.I sat down and as the film unravelled , the most impressive aspect of the movie was clear , the special-effects. As the film trotted on and the American Revolution broke out , we had Mel Gibson babbling on about replacing one tyrant with another , therefore Im going home and others can risk their necks so I can live in freedom , our hero was born. A big battle breaks out and soldiers from both sides are assisted by Mels 'slaves' in his farm , and the victorious British Army ride in  , saving there own men but killing the American Revolutionaries...well something had to be done. Mel then goes on a personal war of vengeance(any commander worth his salt would've restrained such a man) and as the story unfolds we are given the distinct impression , that Mel comes to his senses and kills the Brits thereby winning the war of independence. There are many points to this film that is quite simply nauseating , the way Blacks were compliant 'Uncle Tom's' was one of the worst , but the burning down of The Church...well Ive seen Come and See aswell. This scene put British soldiers on par with the  SS Einzsatgruppen squads in Russia...This was a disgusting spectacle served up by all concerned , but more importantly , why didn't the British Actors remonstrate with Mel Gibson , The producer and the non-British  cast? OK it adds villainy to a film , but the War of Independence in 18th century as seen from Britain's point of view , was very much a polarized issue. The Battle of Saratoga was a better demonstration of what each side did in that conflict , and it was the hallmark of honour in conflict as British troops , though defeated were treated pretty well after surrender and each side respected the others rationale. What Mel and the boys quitely forget or want you to forget , is that one of the true heroes of the War of Independence was Thomas Paine who wrote The Rights of Man and Common Sense and he was English. Also the Earl of Chatham (the most respected British politician of his age) implored George III to let the New World go...even the arch-conservative philosopher Edmund Burke supported American Independence. The Patriot can only be summed up as a shameful distortion of history , that simply rips up the concept of poetic licence and puts in its place  lies and more lies. This film is worth no more than 2/10...Special-effects considered.",Null,0,1,5 February 2001
Zulu," A great film
","Zulu is definately one of the best war films made in the 1960's. A brave film that shows courage , adventure and humanity. The acting is superb , from all quarters. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are brilliant as officers from two very different social backgrounds. Also commentators have noted that Pte Hook in reality was a teetotaler not the malingering barrack-room lawyer that James Booth portrayed. What is lost on the historical purists , is that the writer John Prebble was an ex-communist and was brave enough to point out, not only the class divisions of 19th century Britain , but the point would not be lost on an audience in 1960's Britain. Everyone I know who has seen the film , recalls a memorable line. My own favourite is at the end , when Lt Chard points out to Colour Sergeant Bourne that it was not a miracle that saved them  and proceeds to point out the effectiveness of a box chamber rifle , but Bourne then replys , 'and a bayonet sir , with some guts behind it'. Lt Chard walks away with a knowing smile. Naturally enough , Zulu will always be classed as a War film , but the social commentary was not lost on me. Pte Hook is the prime example and the character portrayed by James Booth is a curt reminder , that it was the poor , socially excluded and criminals that made up the British Army at that time , the Empire and Good Old Days that some quarters of Britains elite today still hanker and sentimentalise about should be reminded of that fact.Zulu is definately in my own top ten films , but the damage done by the film , is that only a very few war films can be placed as better or on par with the film. All Quiet On The Western Front (1930) set the complete overall standard , the great war films(not a list in preferance) however , are ,Saving Private Ryan , Schindlers List , Come and See , Stalingrad , Paths of Glory , Thin Red Line and A Bridge Too Far. The worst or should I say the opportunities missed are Anzio , Battle of Midway and Bridge at Remagen. The only films I can think of that was just simply standard , was Battle of the Bulge , Kelly's Heroes and Gettysburg. I just hope my comments on Zulu helps the historical purists to put things into its proper perspective.",Null,1,2,1 February 2001
Kelly's Heroes," Where the Seventies meets the war.
","Kellys Heroes is a great movie , a bank heist attempt in the middle of a war.Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas are simply at their best when this one was filmed. Kellys Heroes sets the standard as a Comedy War film , not to be taken as anything else.Ive seen this film about five times and I enjoy it , every time I see it. Clint plays the cunning Kelly , and does so with little hidden relish and probably inspired the Sgt Harry Callaghan all film goers came to know and love. The plot is excellent , but what makes it work better , is the characters that are lumped together with one mutual value , greed. The spirit of American capitalism and enterprise is given free reign in this picture , but you have to admire the way the director placed a 1940's (hippy) Oddball amongst a crowd of unscrupulous entrepreneurs. A message to the 1970's hippy generation was definately sent out by the film industry(and perhaps government) , which was getting and making money is a pillar of freedom , just as much as free love and lifestyle. The film is and will remain a great comedy film that displays in no uncertain term , the American experience....Opportunity.",Null,3,4,6 February 2001
Stalingrad," The German point of view in a deadly struggle
","The Battle of Stalingrad will always be known in Modern History , as the conflict that showed Germany the writing on the wall. The Eastern Front war of 1941-1945 was perhaps the most brutal war ever , in the field of arms and battle. Stalingrad and its aftermath left an indellible mark on both German and Russian psyche. The film was in no way a glorification of conflict and the actors and director showed great art in demonstrating the evil and tragedy that Stalingrad surely was in 1942-43. No punches were pulled on the death of soldiers , the scene where the German soldier is killed by a T34 shows that , only too well. The direction of the film , showed the political division between SS and Whermacht ,officers and soldiers alike.The SS were of course brutal and corrupt , but the director tried to display the 'ordinary' soldier as brave and honourable...Im not suggesting that they were n't , but not having any experience of warfare of any kind , I can well imagine that war is and will always remain a brutalising experience...The Battle of Stalingrad more so. The film was and remains a German point of view in a deadly struggle and all-round was brilliant , except perhaps the ending. I think the director wasted his own , the actors and viewers time by using the last 3 soldiers valiant attempt at escape like he did. Stalingrad , a war film connosieurs definate recommendation.",9,0,0,6 February 2001
From Hell," Jack the Ripper - A good film
","Jack the Ripper continues to allude people, even to this day. First and foremost, the suspect list is very extensive. However, this version from the film, From Hell, goes with the popular theory of a Royal/Freemason conspiracy.From Hell, is a film that captures late 1880s London very successfully. The technical and production skills that provide the haunting slum appearance of East London is superb.As for the film, many liberties were indeed taken. Johnny Depp was magnificent as Frederick Aberline...but Aberline cannot be said to be a drug-addict and the ending is fanciful. I understand artistic license, but when a film embarks upon a non-fictional event, the truth or facts, should still be used as the fixture and fitting of a film's direction.I enjoyed the film, and the actors and actresses were extremely good. The story and caveats were interesting, but its the omissions of the case that confused me. For example, Jack the Ripper was identified, not facially, but his clothes were identified. I believe it was a deer stalkers hat and tweed clothing and a small suitcase, which was obviously used for his surgical apparatus. The mystery of the Ripper rests on how the hell, no-one noticed anything and the lack of witnesses. London during the late 1880s was a very over-crowded place, especially the East End, with arrivals from Eastern Jews escaping the pogroms and also Chinese immigrants.The film could've projected the social and political pressures more, as it was these issues, that made the Police work even more daunting, as it was an area that was afflicted with radicalism and communities in perpetual transit. This would mean, many false leads and greater pressure as a result.However as a film, the atmosphere, the production and acting, all combine to make a great film....but not a factual film!",Null,0,2,16 November 2006
Enemy at the Gates," A good film with a good cast.
","After reading a sample of reviewers notes on the film , I felt compelled to give a defence. First and foremost , this film is a treat to war-buffs like myself , and a good all-round entertaining and at some times disturbing look at what happened at Stalingrad.Jude Law was brilliant as the young Red Army sniper, he has picked up criticism for his South London accent...no problem with me. Isnt it actually better to have a peasent/working class tone in the voice , because lets face it..Red Army soldiers were not made up of middle class types who knew there p's and q's. Red Army soldiers were stoic , rough, repressed and extremely tough men and women .So Jude Law should ignore the critics over accent , because people, we have truly moved on from the hashed pigeon accents that were served up for far far too long.Joseph Fiennes was good as the Red Army Political Commissar, especially when he was confronted with the dream ..and noble dream of equality , justice and socialism turned to dust as he was forced to confront his own behaviour that made the fundamental philosophy of communism flawed.Rachel Weisz did a good job as the love interest...I felt the director missed an opportunity to expose the evil the Red Army was up against when Rachel Weisz talked of what happened to her family...a flash-back would've done wonders for the film , as the cinema audience would be compelled to appreciate the Red Army and the atrocities they endured under the Nazis.Which brings me on to Ed Harris...little dialogue , which I thought was pretty good. What can a German sniper possibly talk about , when his stock in trade is patience , silence and being completly cold in his relationship with everything and everyone around him. His performance was pretty good.The Film..well its great , but then Im a war buff. Come and See is still the best film to see when looking at the Second World War on the Eastern Front...Saving Private Ryan and the Thin Red Line still better in effects and story...but this film does not deserve the unjust criticisms that have been laid at its door.A good film, with a good cast.",Null,0,1,3 April 2001
War of the Worlds," Great film, shame about the ending!!!!
","Well after reading other comments, its the ending of the film that undid all the hard work and yards of this movie.Tom Cruise was actually good in this film. What was most refreshing, was the character played by Cruise was a worker on the docks. In the original book, the hero was a journalist.Written by the famous socialist HG Wells, War of the Worlds is a classic in terms of story and literature. Bringing that story into a 21st century setting was interesting. Unlike the 1953 version, which showed America prepared to use the atom bomb on its own Country...somehow, that temptation was avoided by this release.The special-effects, were stunning...the aliens were similar in looks to another famous modern Sci-Fi film...so a minus on the ideas front for that one!Other than that...the effects were great.The plot was true to the book, except the part played by Tim Robbins.However, the ending...how, what, why, where?????? Unbelievable! Would still urge people to see the movie, tension, fear and terror from 10 minutes in to 5 minutes from the end! Great job on Direction!",Null,0,1,22 July 2005
Paths of Glory," One of the great anti-war films
","Paths of Glory is one of the best World War One pictures. Stanley Kubricks work is nothing short of brilliant , and in this production , the term genius can be totally justified in how Kubrick managed to film this tale of World War One.The plot centres around a military objective 'The Ant-Hill' and the French General is persuaded by a Senior at Staff HQ that if he and his division could take the Ant-Hill , then a room for promotion would be made for him. Naturally the General laced by his own reactionary beliefs is easily succumbed to flattery , as the Senior Staff General knows , and accepts the task of demonstrating French will and determination , even though he privately knows that his division is tired and strained , plus the logistics for the Offensive will be completely inadequate .Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is to lead the division on this slaughter...er..sorry , mission. Dax knows the cost will be heavy , even before the division can even reach the German wire. Kubrick also manages to introduce a sub-plot in this saga as a sergeant displays cowardice in front of the enemy in a reconnisance mission...I'll come back to that later... The offensive is a complete failure and some soldiers seeing the carnage refuse to move from there trench..The French General orders Cannon fire on his own line..condemning there cowardice.As the aftermath of the failed offensive is known. The Commanding General refuses to take responsibility for the debacle and as a gesture condemns 3 individuals from each Unit to stand trial on charges of cowardice. The sergeant takes his opportunity in stitching up 1 of his antagonist soldier's and duly puts him up for trial , with 2 other decorated soldiers...The trial takes place and is very emotive , but when the scene ends as the Military Tribunal considers its sentence..The next scene is the assembled excecution squad , pure Kubrick brilliance.Paths Of Glory , brilliant and superb ,only Come and See surpasses this picture..in truly showing the horror of war.",Null,0,0,7 February 2001
300," A Stunning Visual Feast.
","I have actually been to Thermpolaye, when I went on a Classical Tour in the mid 1990s. The setting of the battlefield in the 300 looked nothing like the terrain that I saw, but it makes for a better picture I guess. I've been waiting for this film on DVD ..I wanted to see it on cinema, but time wasn't on my side.Well, finally watched it, thoroughly enjoyed it. Its the rumours that circulated around the film, 'its homo-erotic' or 'its racist'... Maybe I missed something, but I didn't really see that aspect of it. Yes there's nudity and the uglier features of Spartan Society are actually laid bare. The Spartans were very, very religious and that really should've been explored more.Anyway, the film, a visual feast, for those who like battle scenes. The slow motion scenes were truly effective and the mixture of animation and reality was brilliant. It added to the mystique of the times. If I was to cast my eyes on disappointment, it would be the historic inaccuracies and the geographical betrayal. Cold winters and cloudy weather....Were talking Greece here!!! Its hot and the Countryside, especially around Thermopolaye, is hilly and arrid. Olive trees and bushells. The water was calm and battles spanning from the time of Antiquity to the Mediavel era were campaigns that took place in the summertime. Anyhow...A visual feast, I was impressed with Gerard Butler's Leonidas, when he calls to his men, eat hearty this morning, for by the night we shall be dining in hell...unfortunately, he should've said..with the gods!!! David Wenham, as Pelios, commanding performance, excellent narration and a mixture of his previous character in Van Helsing was a nice touch!!! Anyway, definitely a 'must view'...Just for the Battles and the mysticism. The biggest contradiction of all, ws that Spartan society was not only religious, it was extremely conservative, when hearing Leonidas talk of freedom, justice and reason...I did think, 'hang on a minute'!! Because it was the Spartans under Lysander that beat Athenians in the Pelyopinesian Wars..and destroyed a society that actually strived for those virtues. Anyway...Enjoy the film.",Null,1,2,7 October 2007
Windtalkers," Great action, but a missed opportunity
","Ive just this moment, saw Windtalkers. I was really excited about seeing this movie about Navaho Indian codes and the Battle for Saipan. The budget for this movie was immense and I was not dissapointed in the special effects department either.However, as some commentators have noted, I did find the shooting of Japanese soldiers a bit over done. Scene after scene involving conflict, the US soldiers were shooting the Japanese with a bit of impunity whilst the US soldiers suffered more from artillery than the bullets fired from Imperial Japanese forces. The military adviser in this film really fell down on his job. Thank god I've never been to war, but I do feel the Director made the conflict just a bit one-sided in terms of fighting capability as the Japs it seems couldn't shoot properly. Im sure the veterans either laughed or cried at the ease in which the film demonstrated the taking of Japanese trench positions.The duty of a Director is to get a story across and a war movie, especially now, is to show how war really is, so that the audience can actually  get a closer understanding of conflict and its consequences. The film Windtalkers, did at key stages look at how war brutalizes people, and the characters involved explored that concept, but after suffering traumatic and terrible scenes of carnage that brutalization was replaced by deep friendship and the spirit and comradeship that only a combat soldier could experience.
Windtalkers should be rated as a great action movie, but it was a missed opportunity in regard to the Navaho Indians and their unique story & contribution in World War 2. The next time the Director embarks on a war movie, a little more substance in plot in place of action and unessacary diversions is advisable.",Null,0,1,17 February 2003
Braveheart," A good film if you know nothing about Scottish History
","When I first saw Braveheart , I was really impressed and the battle scenes were stunning and extremely graphic , which I thought was a refreshing change. Simply because the old medieval films Hollywood served were usually the arrow in the chest and sword thrust in the stomach variety.The scenes in the battles certainly put the evil in Medieval. Im not a historical purist (as other comments have shown) so I thought Id let the Battle of Stirling Bridge slide , the reason being obvious , as I didnt see a bridge in the films battle scenes. Anyway , Patrick McGoohan was absolutely brilliant as Edward (Hammer of the Scots)Longshanks. He captured Edward so well , that if any film is made now involving King Edward , any actor would have to follow McGoohans line. Make no mistake , Edward I was every bit as evil and psychopathic as the one in Braveheart. It was Edward I dying wish , that whenever there was a war between Scotland and England , his remains were to be taken to the field of conflict. Now the hero William Wallace , yes a great warrior and leader of resistance and again I'll let historical fact slide. William Wallace was over 6ft...a giant in that day and age ...did Mel really stand out among his men?..but hey. But I was forced to go in the puke bucket when Mel was hitting it off with the Princess of France. I mean , the real Princess  arrived in England 13 years after Wallace had been hung drawn and quartered. If Mel Gibson really wanted a love interest after his wife was murdered , he could 've gone for a 13 year old Glaswegian whore , and still keep the story based on fact...if Nigel Tranter the foremost authority on Scottish History is to be believed.But again dont let the facts get in the way of a good story , quite right...too a point though. Braveheart is a good film in many ways , but if there were Scottish historians and English viewers seeing the film , they would most probably have got the sick-bucket out",Null,2,4,5 February 2001
The Breakfast Club," An eighties insight
","When I watched The Breakfast Club on TV the other day , I was surprised that I felt the same emotions after viewing the film the first time round. As an 80's kid , admittedly an English one. The characters of the film were so similar to how we all actually were. The geek , we all had one of them in a class , the wannabe rebel who thought he was smarter than everyone else , and the Sporty type , filled with a demanding father's high expectations. Im so sorry that Ive omitted the female cast , as I myself went to an all boys school...gives a clue to why you find Englishman sexually and emotionally repressed , but hey thats another story.Anyway , the film showed an insight to the social-strata of America , it seemed that safe nice middle-class types only get into contact with the Plebians at High School...Im sure thats not really how it is. The Film I believe is a top drawer offering on how confused and demanding the 80's really were for children portrayed by The Breakfast Club. Ally Sheedy's character (Allison I believe) was a real eye-opener , the Cinderella , a girl enforced into obscurity by Parents who ignored her , and yet with one make-over we see a real princess who instantly seals the affections of Andy (Emilio Estevez)...For American readers , the kids in the 80's in Britain were not only so-so similar to the kids in the film , but if you somehow added the Industrial and Political conflict that existed outside the School gate then you would've had an even more sharper and cynical scope for characters if a Breakfast Club version was ever made or set in the UK.For the lighter version of the film , the music and dancing was pure escapist brilliance. Especially when the scene follows on from the Teacher talking to the Janitor , saying 'these kids are gonna run the Country'. Well lets hope the leaders in 2010 will be able to dance and do make-overs as they try and pay for Pensions and Healthcare and keep us all from bombing each other..Anyway the best line in the film is when Bender says to Brian after doing an impression of his home life(which Judd Nelson's character was secretly jealous of) saying 'your a parents wet-dream'. That was such a great line.I recommend The Breakfast Club , because one it is like a film anthem for the p***ed off kids of the 80s , which I will gladly admit that Im a definate one of that Generation B club.
