The Blair Witch Project," Save your money!!!!
","Basically, it's about as scary as a home taping of the loch ness monster.  I found the movie to be absolutely boring.  Yes, it was new and different and I give the film makers credit for that....BUT I could have slept through the ending without missing a thing.  Okay, if you pretend it's real you might think 'that's kinda weird' but that's about it.  Don't waste your seven-fifty.",1,0,2,31 July 1999
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Amazing!!
","This happens to be one of my all time favorite movies.  It is truly amazing. Pricilla is witty, and all together the greatest comedy ever.  I am in total awe of it, I know almost every line by heart and have watched it countless times.  I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor!",10,5,9,18 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," great movie
","Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen.  It has an enthralling plot and quick humor.  The twist at the end is only the finishing touch. The Usual Suspects is indeed a film that everyone should see as many times as possible because it only gets better.",10,0,1,16 June 1999
