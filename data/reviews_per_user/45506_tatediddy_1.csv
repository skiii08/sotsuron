Your Name.," Kimi no na wa, a story that uses every bit of its potential.
","The first time I watched the film I didn't know what I was expecting, and I'm so glad that I had no expectations. From the story to the animation/cinematography, Your Name did not disappoint me for a single second of the story that unfolded in front of me. It felt that every word and character mattered in this movie, there were no puzzle pieces that didn't fit. As I was watching, I felt a connection to each character, feeling what they were feeling. Not many movies can accomplish sympathy for each character. But Makoto Shinkai (Director) was able to captivate me as a viewer and as a person. There is no reason not to watch this film, and if you haven't I strongly advise you do. It might just change your perspective.",10,1,1,31 July 2018
