Alien 3," Not my favorite
","I really enjoy the Alien series, but what I disliked most about this one was when Ripley had the alien in her body it took a long while for it to burst from her chest. And in other movies, it was pretty much as soon as you awoke from you 'coma.' That kind of irked me. I'm sure they just tried hard to make it drag out, because she was one of the main characters, but still I thought that was unfitting. And another thing, when it finally did pop out of her chest, it didn't fight to break through her ribcage it just popped out! And she was still alive!!!! Are you kidding me?! And I read the synopsis and it said the Queen came out of her chest. How exactly do you know it was the Queen? It's head wasn't large and all that jazz. Alrighty, I think I'm done here lol",4,0,1,2 January 2012
