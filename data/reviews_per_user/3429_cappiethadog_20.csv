It," It hurts
","A crouching little boy picks the wrong time to be rational. It's just a clown, he thinks, nothing unusual about that. There is no such thing as monsters, George Denbrough(Jackson Robert Scott) decides, not wanting to feel like the 'wuss' his older brother(Jaeden Lieberter) called him, right before he fetched the paraffin from their cellar for a paper boat that needed waterproofing, now in the painted man's clutches. After all, there was no monster in the cellar. Horror movies conditioned George to be afraid of the dark, like all children since the advent of motion pictures. But his kid fears differ from kid fears past. What goes bump in the night changes with every proceeding generation. 'It', set in 1989, not 1957, the original setting for the Stephen King novel, reveals the fallacy of the period piece that the story purported to be. Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddie Krueger are the monsters that George fears; plausible monsters, all the more terrifying because they are recognizably human, more so than their predecessors, literary ones, such as the werewolf, the vampire, the mummy, and Frankenstein. Those two glowing pinpricks of white in the cellar recesses could be the eyes of a serial killer. It turned out to be nothing; just paint cans, when George pointed his flashlight at the storage shelf.On a Derry theater marquee, 'Nightmare on Elm Street 5' is playing, an eighties period touch that conveys how Pennywise(Bill Skaarsgard) has more in common with contemporary horror movie villains than his peers of yesteryear. The murderous clown could be John Wayne Gacy. The Denbrough brothers are part of the slasher film generation. As George walks tentatively down those cellar steps, there is a self-awareness; he is every screaming female or shouting male who didn't simply leave the house to avoid danger. George is living the trope. Bad things happen in the dark. In order to be safe, he needs to be outside where it's lighted. When Frankenstein's monster threw that little girl in the lake, play was his intent, not murder. Unlike George's counterpart from 1957, this updated character has seen his fair share of gore. He grew up with depiction after depiction, often grisly, of deliberate killings. Betty Ripson is missing. George knows that adults are the real monsters. They were hockey masks. They wear ugly long-sleeved sweaters. Monsters from vintage horror movies rarely, if ever, finished the job on children. The juxtaposition of Pennywise and Freddie Krueger(Robert Englund), in this new adaptation of 'It', breaks down a fourth wall in King's 1986 novel that nobody had noticed. Frankenstein kills the girl, but her drowning wasn't premeditated. The clown, just like Freddie Krueger, and unlike a vampire circa 1957, has no limits to the satiation of his bloodlust. And there is intention. Pennywise lures George close enough with the recovered paper boat as bait and bites his hand clean off the arm. The boy crawls away in vain before Pennywise drags him into the sewer, leaving behind a mix of blood and rainwater on the street. 'It', in retrospect, was always dressed in eighties clothing. Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' came out in 1984. And in 1985, 'The Goonies', directed by Richard Donner, practically provides the template for Stephen King's tome about good and evil.Filmmaker and dad Steven Spielberg, in 2002, wanted to please moms, so for the twentieth anniversary of 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial', he digitally-erased the guns held by FBI men and replaced them with walkie-talkies throughout the penultimate sequence, in which Elliot(Henry Thomas) and the boys race towards their barricaded area on two-wheels. After all, it's a children's movie, Spielberg thought. When E.T. uses his heartlight to elevate their bicycles into the sky, what are the feds going to do: Shoot them down? To make 'The Goonies' more kid-friendly, however, whitewashing all potentiality for violence is an impossibility, because like Andy Muschetti's adaptation of 'It', this group of outcasts, too, face a monster, albeit a human one: Mama Fratelli(Anne Ramsey). Pennywise lived in the house on Neibolt Street. The Fratelli brothers, Jake(Robert Daivi) and Francis(Joe Pantaliano) and their mother, wanted by the law, take up temporary residence at a restaurant, shuttered-down for the summer. Arguably, the gang's matriarch nearly matches the clown's malevolence towards children. If necessary, she would kill. Under the flimsiest pretenses of being a restaurant, Mama, the waitress from hell, asks the boys for their order. Water is the near-consensus choice. Only Mouth(Corey Feldman), the clueless wiseacre, misses all the signals and goes into shtick mode, pretending to be an old world Sicilian accustomed to fine Italian cuisine. With one hand, the crotchety old lady silences the boy by making both cheeks meet, forcing his lips to purse, his eyes to pop, and his disposition to change, while she pulls out a switchblade. 'We only serve tongue here,' Mama announces. This is no idle threat; we believe her. She put bullet holes into at least one of the two federal agents. She seems fully capable of leaving Mouth tongue-less. That's because the mother is a genuine sociopath, who constantly tests the parameters of a designated PG-rated film. This realism, the possibility of dying by felonious, not accidental means is what sets 'The Goonies' apart from other children's movies, and closer to the filmic world of Derry, Maine. Noting their prepubescence, the old woman turns lewd, asking the boys if they 'like tongue', a joke seemingly about cannibalism until Andy(Kerri Green) mistakenly kisses Mikey(Sean Astin) at the wishing well, turning the bon mot into a double entendre. Back home, before their adventure starts, Chunk(Jeff Cohen) drops Mrs. Walsh's David statue and his 'junk' breaks off. 'It's mom's favorite part,' Mikey complains. Chunk gets razzed for gluing it back on, but if you take a closer look, the reattachment perfectly mimics the state that Mike is in. During the kiss, it becomes Mikey's favorite part, too. The growing pains of a shy tween like Mike Walsh undergoes, 'The Goonies', with ninja precision, encapsulates in that Michelangelo nude. Stephen King is not a ninja. The unfilmable rite of passage scene remains unfilmable. In 'It', the soundtrack of reaching all the bases, and 'it' itself, that runs wild through the young boys' imagination is old-school rap. Nobody is going to 'Bust a Move' on Beverly Marsh(Sophia Lillis), who sunbathes, oblivious to her feminine wiles, after an afternoon swim in the reservoir, because they have no idea how to bust a move. That is the dissonance of the King novel. It's a fifties period-piece, in which the characters are not only too bloodied, but also too precocious, and too young to make Caligula blush.Sloth(John Matuszak) is not 'it'. The hideously disfigured son, the forgotten Martelli, secreted away in his private room, with only the television for company, could be one of Pennywise's waking nightmare manifestations. Surely, he would scare the bejesus out of Stan(Wyatt Oleff), since the ogre-like man is abstract, just like the woman in the painting. Outside the gilded frame, an artfully-rendered body is a deformed body that becomes the moving focal point of dislocation in the physical world. 'An it, a giant it; they got it chained to the wall,' Mike exclaims to his older brother Bran(Josh Brolin), before they go back inside to resume the search for One-Eyed Willie's treasure. The proverbial 'it' in the King novel is a gargantuan spider. The clown is a manifestation of that arachnoid, a she. Interestingly enough, when Mikey notifies Mama that he needs to use the bathroom, Chunk discourages the visit, explaining to the proprietor that 'they might have daddy long legs in them'. In the made-for-television 1990 adaptation of 'It', the arachnoid could easily be mistaken for a he. The spider is androgynous. Mama Fratelli is androgynous, too. All the boys answer, 'Thank you mam,' when she sets down four cups of brown water, except for Mikey, who mistakenly says, 'Thank you, sir.' At the pirate ship, later in the film, Mama points a gun at the children, who are busy enriching themselves with treasure. She would pull the trigger, or rather, it would pull the trigger. Mama Fratelli would bite George's hand off if he had a diamond in it. The transference act that King had performed gets negated by moving 'It' to the late-eighties. 'The Goonies' latency that was always there seems less like a dislocation of content, since violence committed against children in film and literature contemporaneous to the fifties is something of an anachronism. It's not now; both in art and life, unfortunately.The Chilean dictator in Pablo Larrain's 'Tony Manero' goes to a bijou that only plays 'Saturday Night Fever'. He believes Tony Manero(John Travolta) is real. Pablo feels the authenticity in John Badham's film about the NYC disco scene. Travolta's next film 'Grease', directed by Randal Kleiser, was a seventies film about the fifties. But the new songs written especially for the adapted Broadway show: 'Hopelessly Devoted to You' and 'You're the One I Want', turns the period piece into a period piece in quotations. They're too contemporary. 'Grease' is a 1978 film about the fifties that has a distinct seventies burnish. The dictator senses the dishonesty. He hates Danny Zuko. The greasers are not good enough. The film projectionist doesn't know that he's in for IT.",7,1,1,24 April 2019
Hereditary," Extraordinary people
","Calvin Jarrett(Donald Sutherland) finally takes a side, his surviving son's side, and stops making excuses for Beth(Mary Tyler Moore). Conrad(Timothy Hutton) was right; he, too, can see it now. Beth Jarrett is not an ordinary person. When did his wife become unknowable? Donald Sutherland, whose previous role was that of a San Francisco health inspector in Phillip Kaufman's 1979 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', famously shrieks and points at a woman, a human, in the film's final scene. Nancy(Veronica Cartwright) finds out too late that Dr. Matthew Bennell turned into a pod person. This time, the woman gets to be the pod. And although 'Ordinary People', Robert Redford's 1980 debut film, is not a genre picture, an element of horror, the human sort, makes Beth's demeanor all the more bloodcurdling, because here, the dramaturgy at work is the human condition, a precept of allegory. Calvin, who loves Conrad and his deceased son Buck in equal proportion, sees the vacancy in her eyes when her surviving child stoops down to give his seated mother an unreciprocated hug in the living room. Sutherland doesn't point and scream like a banshee, but the father's silence is a judgement, the same as the health inspector: You are not one of us. In the Kaufman film, a half-awake Dr. Bennell fights a losing fight against sleep, which as a result, turns him into a plant-based replica. Calvin, conversely, is half-asleep, always willing to give Beth the benefit of the doubt, explaining to his son's therapist(Judd Hirsch) that she loves Conrad, but has a hard time expressing it. Now, however, both eyes are wide open, an eyewitness, he is, to Beth's shortcomings; a blank face, a telling projection of her maternal disconnect to an atoning son's show of affection. She doesn't love Conrad. Later that night, Beth packs her suitcase. The marriage is over. 'I don't know who you are anymore,' he says. Neither does Beth. Calvin was right when he tells Dr. Berger that the best of his wife was buried with Buck. Reminiscent of Bryan Forbes' 'The Stepford Wives', the Christmas shopping sequence shows Beth, in her element, a mall, saying 'hello' from an escalator to a friend on another escalator going the opposite direction, seemingly happy. In the next scene, we realize that she's going through the motions. In a high-end clothing shop, Beth stares at, or rather, stares through a mannequin outfitted in a sparkly red dress. 'May I show this in your size?' the saleslady asks the perfect homemaker, who slinks away in embarrassment, laughing at the woman's inquiry, as if trying on a slinky red thing was the most ridiculous thing she ever heard of. There is nobody left to get dressed up for. That mannequin, so lifeless, so much like a corpse, and headless, Beth recognizes as her old self, the life of any party, who escaped from the cemetery. Sure, she still gathers by the piano with other high society ladies, singing alongside them at exclusive soirees, laughs on cue at unfunny jokes told by stodgy captains of industry, and always knows the right thing to say in public before her class-conscious friends, but it's not her. Nobody can tell that she's a robot on the fritz. Nobody can tell that somebody attached her head to a new body.Annie Graham(Toni Collette), wife and mother, a seemingly ordinary person, just like Beth Jarrett, loves her two children disproportionately. It's hereditary, the Robert Redford film and this debut feature by Ari Aster, but the Grahams are not ordinary people, in spite of Annie's best efforts to shield her loved ones from the Leigh family history of mental health issues. Starting with her mother, Ellen, whose funeral, in the aftermath, inspires Annie to remark 'should I be sadder?' back home with her stalwart husband Steve(Gabriel Byrne), and ending with herself, who once tried to set her son on fire. Sleepwalking, the mother was, but ever since the miniaturist artist doused kerosene on Peter(Alex Wolff), coming perilously close to setting him ablaze with the strike of a match, he presumed, correctly, as it turns out, that his younger sister Charlie(Milly Shapiro) was Annie's favorite. In 'Ordinary People', the husband accuses Beth of needing life to be 'neat and tidy'. Similarly, Annie's miniatures, based on her real life as a wife and mother, recreations of familiar interiors and familiars, are static, like establishing shots frozen in amber. 'Small World', Annie's upcoming show, is emblematic of 'neat and tidy', 'mess'-free domestic dioramas; a projection of what Calvin accuses his wife of wanting; no family crises. Beth was a private person; she didn't want people knowing her business. And Annie, likewise, reveals nothing in her art that she doesn't want the world to see. For example, hours after her Ellen Leigh's funeral, she tells Charlie: 'Grandma wouldn't let me feed you because she wanted to feed you,' while tucking her in for the night. Translated into miniature art, Annie uses her creative license to change history. While her mother stands bedside looking feeble and adrift with her breast lay bare, Annie is in charge, feeding Charlie. But all artists are liars. If the figurines possessed fluidity, the observer would see two partially-exposed women fighting over nursing rights. The manifestation of Ellen's ghost in the spare room, Annie can sense, relates to Charlie, which is why she faces the the bedroom scene away from her. The mother knows that Ellen is coming after her granddaughter, but how?Annie is Heracles, the Greek figure who thinks he has control over his own destiny, ignoring all the signs that propose otherwise. Peter's English teacher defends Heracles, which has the effect of absolving Annie from being arrogant, because 'Sophocles wrote the oracle so that it was unconditional.' There are signs. She sees her mother's ghost; she knows that the door to Ellen's bedroom should be closed, but still denies the presiding matriarch's presence over the family. A second class is in session, concurrently; Charlie's class, the one with Satan as an unaccounted-for pupil. At her desk, Peter's sister works on a doll, the more pressing concern, than the teacher's quiz, because life as she knows is almost over. And so it begins, fate's first move against the 'pawns in a hopeless machine'. A blackbird's progress ends in a crash against the classroom window. It's fatal flight draws Charlie's classmate to the smeared glass, except for Charlie, who eyes the scissors on her teacher's desk, instead. The blackbird loses its head. Charlie loses her head. Ellen's young protege knew that she'd be decapitated, but not how, when, or where. Grandma was a practicing Satanist. What looks like a series of convolutions that leads to Charlie's beheading: Annie's insistence that Peter should bring his sister to a house party; the presence of walnuts in the chocolate cake that flares up Charlie's allergies; the swelled neck that restricts her breathing which leads to a rolled-down window and protruding head, was, in actuality, preordained, because the occult language is inscribed on the telephone pole's surface. The accident was foretold. That's the devil. In 'Ordinary People', the row boating tragedy was forewarned. Conrad admits to Dr. Berger that they should have known better; there were gathering storm clouds brewing. That's God.Conrad Jarrett should have been the drowning victim, not survivor. To her credit, Beth never comes out and says that. There is no direct expression of a mother's choice. Annie, on the other hand, admits as much in her nightmare, a two-fold dream told with visuals then words, in which we learn how her art, so seemingly objective is not so objective, after all; it just obfuscates her subjective point-of-view. Annie's dream starts like this: She awakens to black ants on her bedsheets; ants that form a trail to her son's room. The mother, we already know, can't forgive Peter, because she said so in a family dinner that went off the rails. The mother looks agonizingly over the ants covering the whole of her son's face, knowing that this was Charlie's roadside condition, a makeshift ant colony. Annie recreates a miniature of her daughter's death. This nightmare is the subtext of that installation. Whereas Beth shouts: 'Buck wouldn't be in a hospital!' as a way of intuiting her preference that Conrad had been the body in the casket, Peter's mother is more on-point. Annie's dream folds into another dream: She wakes up from sleepwalking; she tells her son: 'I never wanted to be your mother.' Peter would have been an abortion if not for Ellen's intervention. But both mother and son misunderstood the night of the attempted murder. Peter was sleeping in the wrong bed. Charlie, in accordance with church dogma, was slated for death. In 'Ordinary People', Beth treated Buck like a God, but it's Conrad who possessed a sort-of god-like strength to have held onto the boat. Deep within her subconscious, because evil is 'Hereditary', Annie knew that Peter was a vessel for Paimon, one of the eight kings of hell. That's why the match remained unlit.'Hereditary', arguably, is 'Ordinary People' retold as a horror film. The Grahams are extraordinary people. Instead of personal demons, the family has actual demons in them; the devil inside. Both mothers don't like messes. Beth was a housewife; her counterpart, an artist. Annie, like Beth in that small boutique, can't go through the motions any longer. Conrad's mother needed her husband to snap her out of it. Annie, a modern woman, does it herself. 'I am not sleepwalking anymore,' she yells at Steve over the phone, and smashes her latest installation, a recreation of Ellen's funeral, to pieces. She can't pretend any longer that it was an unhappy event. She tells the truth, finally. Annie's art was a corrective measure to her life. She makes a mess. Now her art is true-to-life.",8,1,4,22 May 2019
Rocketman," Ada and the Jets
","'And the wind said: 'Remember how we used to play?' Ada McGrath(Holly Hunter), a mute Englishwoman, signs to Flora(Anna Paquin), her daughter, on a far-flung beach in 19th century New Zealand. 'Then the wind took her hand and said, 'Come, come with me,'' Ada continues, as they wait for her husband, an enterprising homesteader, inside her own crinoline that she refashioned as a makeshift tent. Flora is her collaborator; the mother and daughter form a partnership, in day-to-day life and in art. Ada scribbles prosaic things on a small notepad she keeps chained around her neck. Flora is her voice in the oral sense; she's the wordsmith. The daughter is a storyteller. She tells her stepfather's housekeeper that Ada, an Austrian opera singer, was married to a German composer. They were rehearsing in the drenched forest, oblivious to the downpouring, because 'so passionate was their singing,' according to Flora, that they didn't hear the thunder. 'Mother never spoke another word,' after father was struck down by lightning. Flora is lyrical. 'The Piano', the 1993 Palm d'or-winning film by Jane Campion, has for a heroine, a piano woman whose music does all the talking. The daughter's stories are proto-lyrics, inspired by Ada's music, whereas in Dexter Fletcher's 'Rocket Man', it's the musician, Elton John(Taron Egerton), whose compositions are sparked by Bernie Taupin(Jaime Bell), the 1992 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee who would have poeticized Ada's hand gesturing into this: 'And they whispered into your brain,' a line from the 1974 song about Marilyn Monroe, the one with the chorus; 'And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind.''Candle in the Wind' is from Elton John's seventh album 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', the third single that somehow failed to chart, despite following the wild success of the title track, a number one hit; the songwriting team's third in a row. It's this song, the elegiac 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' that Taupin sings as he walks out of a restaurant after an attempt at reconciliation proves to be futile. 'So goodbye yellow brick road/Where the dogs of society howl/You can't plant me in your penthouse/I'm going back to my plough,' which are his words, not Elton's, even though 'Rocket Man' treats them as if they were. For instance, 'The ***** is Back' is staged at an AA meeting: 'I was justified when I was five,' he recounts to the other recovering alcoholics, in what turns out to be the film's prologue, because Eggerton passes off his vocal duties to Sebastian Rich, while he watches his nine-year-old self(Matthew Illesley), back when he was Reginald Dwight, growing up in the lower-middle-class milieu of suburban Middlesex. Originally, the '*****' in question is probably John, but the film coopts Taupin's lyrics as code for his cold and distant father, Stanley(Steven McIntosh), a '*****' who is 'back' from a business trip. Taupin must have undergone an identity crisis at one time or another. Quite tellingly, at the 1978 Science Fiction Awards, he introduces William Shatner's spoken word interpretation of 'Rocket Man' as 'MY rocket man,' which not coincidentally, took place during the period when he and John took a break from their songwriting partnership, following the poorly received 'Blue Moves'(1977). It's not hard to imagine that Bernie took a taxi straight from the USC campus straight to the meeting with his estranged partner right after Shatner was done. Neither man can admit that they need each other. At the awards ceremony, Taupin wanted the world to know that he played a key role in Elton John's ascension to superstardom. Very subtly, 'Rocket Man' acknowledges the lyricist's hurt feelings of being underappreciated, since 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' makes reference to Victor Fleming's 'The Wizard of Oz'. Elton may be the 'Pinball Wizard', but if you were to pull back the curtain, there would stand Bernie, writing his resignation letter: 'Maybe you'll get a replacement/There's plenty like me to be found/Mongrels who ain't got a penny/Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground.' Elton John, in a sense, left Oz, too, and recorded two Taupin-less albums: 'A Single Man'(1978) and the disco-inflected 'Victim of Love'(1979), both panned, especially the latter. The 'Pinball Wizard', as it turns out, was an amalgamation. Elton found himself back in Kansas, so to speak. 'Oh, I've finally decided where my future lies/Beyond the yellow brick road.' Six years after the platinum-selling, thirty times over 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', Taupin's words smacked of prophecy.Music is a language. Ada's husband Alistair(Sam Neill), the unofficial king of Auckland, doesn't understand or doesn't care that the piano is his newlywed's voice. The colonized Maoris, who make up his convoy, haul everything but the piano, her primary form of self-expression, back to the village. The other white man, Baines(Harvey Keitel), adorned with tribal face tattoos, because he ingratiated himself within this tribe of indigenous New Zealanders, agrees to reunite Ada with her instrument.They reach the beach. The mother plays; the daughter dances. Flora is her muse. Together, they form a creative team to be reckoned with. Ada's composition suggests this couplet: 'Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand,' as she performs for her small audience along the shoreline. Flora cartwheels; her dancing is lyrical, expressing the interconnectedness between mother and child: 'And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand.' But times being what they are, the mid-19th century, the two 'girls' can't escape the tyranny of men. Baines, opportunistic and libidinous, is like a proto-groupie. The two men barter. Baines obtains the piano. He wants to sleep with a musician. Alistair, similar to Elton John's manager John Reid(Richard Madden), drives a wedge between the fertile tandem. Across centuries, therein lies two men who don't love properly; both musicians are treated like property. With John, it's the money that he makes for his manager/lover, and as for Ada, it's the love that she makes; lovemaking as an act of slavery, resulting in either a child and marital love(Alistair), or a lovechild and romantic love(Bailey). Platonic relationships, in both instances: parent/child and musician/poet are severed, resulting in a lost finger for Aida and the lost potentiality of hit songs for John/Taupin, in due part to the machinations of scoundrels.Ada sides with the Maoris; her piano is too heavy for the canoe. They're right. The canoe's progress to England will increase exponentially without the ballast of the cumbersome instrument. It's time for a proper Viking funeral. But what is the Victorian woman thinking? The pianist plants her foot in the center of the looped rope, so when the piano is given the heave-ho, the woman follows; woman overboard. Ada's kindred spirit of sorts, Elton John, likewise, attempts suicide by submerging himself in water, too, albeit, on a smaller scale, a swimming pool. Unexpectedly, John's drowning is the visual cue for 'Rocket Man', in which the singer-songwriter sees his child-self seated at a tiny piano on the pool's bottom. Taupin describes a patriarchal world when he writes: 'Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids,' if you prescribe to the notion that Mars is 'masculine' and Venus is 'feminine'. Ada knows this first-hand, that it's 'in fact...cold as hell,' despite the temperate climate of the tropical rainforest in Karekare. The piano, for Ada, is ruined, like her left hand; the missing finger, she thinks, will impede her ability to play. On one of the white piano keys, Ada had inscribed: 'Dear George, you have my heart,' but her identity is tied to that piano, maimed like her, which would be fine if being some man's wife outweighed the sensation of accomplishment and self-worth she gets as a musical composer; an artist. Taupin's words: 'And there's no one to raise them if you did,' uncannily doubles as the mother's mind voice, remembering Ada does, that Flora would be left alone to explicate Mars' compositional subtext, Venus, without the music of a mother's maternal love as a guide. She frees her foot from the loop, inspired by the idea that being a parent is enough reason to live. Elton John's suicide attempt can be explained from a different section of 'Rocket Man': 'And I'm going to be high as a kite by then.' If John died in 1975, 'burning out his fuse up here alone,' he would have missed out on meeting his two sons. Speaking in strictly platonic and also, songwriting partnership terms, Bernie Taupin may have birthed 'Rocket Man', but he was not a hands-on mother; Taupin was just the lyricist. Elton John fulfilled two roles, the father and surrogate mother; that's what conscientious composers do. The two men were never in the same room for any of their collaborations. John worked alone. Bernie wrote the lyrics, and literally mailed it in.'Tiny Dancer' is a queenly song. It's the working heart in 'Almost Famous', Cameron Crowe's autobiographical films about his time as a cub reporter for 'Rolling Stone' magazine. Everybody remembers the singalong on the tour bus that breaks the tension between Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup) and his Stillwater bandmates, who resent the lead guitarist's perception that he's 'a golden god'. Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), the self-described 'band-aid', as everybody knows, is the 'blue jean baby' with the 'pirate smile'. What people forget is that Crowe used a second Elton John song, 'Mona Lisa & Mad Hatters', an album track from the 1972 album '***** Chateau'. William Miller(Patrick Fugit) loves Penny. The song plays over his mad search for her in the dense streets of New York City, peering into taxi cabs, going out of his mind.'And I thank the lord for the people I have found,' writes Taupin, sings John, and resides in William's soul, when the paramedics pump the quaaludes out of her system in a lonely hotel room bathtub.",6,2,4,17 June 2019
Us," the Tijuana underground
","The man who runs a soup kitchen in the Bronx knows that something is not right with the city he feeds.A.J.(Daniel Stern), a self-styled reverend, tells Bosch(Christopher Curry) about the dwindling numbers of his homeless clientele. 'Ten to twelve of my regulars,' the good Samaritan explains to the police chief, 'undergrounders' he calls them, are unaccounted for. They're vagrants who live beneath the concrete, 'a regular labyrinth of tunnels and caves'. Douglas Cheek's 'C.H.U.D.' is a B-movie with something to say. The 1984 cult-classic provides 'Us' with a template for Jordan Peele's leitmotif of forgotten Americans. Peele locates the film's socio-economical message: America has a caste system, and isolates it from the dreck. 'Us' forces the audience to reconsider who the real monsters are in 'C.H.U.D.' These seemingly malevolent frogmen, living in the recesses of the sewer, are a militia, which only becomes clear when we learn that these radioactive creatures turn out to be reconfigured human beings, denatured so by toxic waste. These humanoids, in their former incarnation as 'bums', were treated by the people at large as a homogenous group you either pitied or felt revulsion towards. They were city pariahs with bad hygiene and unwashed ill-fitting clothes. 'C.H.U.D.' starts off with what appears to be a random and senseless murder. A woman, walking her pooch at night, fails to notice the clawed hands gripping both sides of a dislodged manhole cover. The cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers don't look it, but they're intelligent beings, and know that woman to be Mrs. Bosch. Once ignored, these reconstructed beggars command people's attention; their never-ending co-dependence on ephemeral patrons are over. It must be the creatures' glowing yellow eyes, sharp elongated fangs, and slimy reptilian bodies. Among the murdered whom the radioactive hobos settle grudges with are the usual suspects; belligerent cops with city-mandated orders to tear down their cardboard cities, and heartless waitresses at that diner-turned-crime scene whose policy was to never hand out freebies. Comeuppance never befalls on Wilson(George Martin), the man responsible for this alchemy made possible by the stockpiling of hazardous waste materials in the subterrestrial hell where displaced men and women call home. Humans, not C.H.U.D.'s kill the corrupt NRC guy. 'C.H.U.D.' never overreaches, never intends to make a grand statement, just a small one about the dangers of untreated toxic waste. It probably never occurred to the director-for-hire that Wilson is the humanoids' leader. But auteur Jordan Peele sees it; he is a post-modernist ethnographer, part Quentin Tarantino, part-Gregory Nava. Peele has Tarantino's gift for historical revisionism, but in this case, it's history in the making that he writes and extrapolates. Peele recognizes what 'C.H.U.D.' never underscores, or even notices, which is that Wilson's malfeasance has the accidental effect of giving these disposable people a reason to live. They have a superpower. They exist.It's a home invasion; black on black crime. 'Us' is attacked by 'Them', a seemingly prosaic sentence that function both as a bit of plot synopsis and also a pointed and ironic reference to the French-family-under-siege horror flick(original title 'Ils'). Red(Lupita Nyong'o) makes the case, however, for being 'us', too, not 'them', the proverbial other, when she declares, 'We're Americans,' as she stares down her mirror image Adelaide, in response to her question: 'What are you people?' Why is it 'what' and not 'who'? It's because 'Us', unlike lesser films, doesn't employ the repressed memory as a plot contrivance. Adelaide knows who she is before the audience does. See 'Us' a second time and you'll get a different read on her anxiety as the family approaches the same Santa Ana beach, scene of the crime, so many years ago. Back at their vacation house, Adelaide has an idea what, not who, these people are the very moment her son(Evan Alex) announces their presence in the driveway. The wife/mother knows why her husband's lookalike substitutes words with animal noises, and why her duplicate children make no noise at all. Most important of all, she knows why Red is fluent in English, and more worldly-wise than her kin. Way back when, in that hall of mirrors, the nameless girl cuts to the chase; she doesn't wait for the girl with a name to fall asleep; she doesn't have a pod on her to place beside the real girl's body in deep repose. The girl wearing the 'Thriller' t-shirt is wide awake when the nameless one snatches her from the mirrorless mirror. Among other things, 'Us' reimagines an 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers, in which the 'pod person' learns to be human. Adelaide's parents know that something is wrong, just like the wife(Brooke Adams) in Philip Kaufman's 1979 version, but whereas Elizabeth knew her catatonic husband was a replacement, Adelaide's parent think their little girl is suffering from PSD. The nameless girl learns to be human. Adelaide(now Red) never loses her humanity. 'Little girl, run,' Red warns Zora(Shahadi Wright Jackson) because her doppleganger Umbrae is a killing machine. Likewise, the nameless girl who snatched the named girl's life away. between the intervening time as a child and an adult, reinvented Adelaide, and who can say for certain that the real McCoy would have turned out better. That's compassion in the nameless woman's eyes, as she checks on Umbrae, who takes her last breath in the woods after being hit by their car. 'Us' makes a case for nurture over nature, while it simultaneously makes another case for nature over nurture. After a lifetime of living among replicas, The Little Girl Formerly Known As Adelaide emerges as the leader of her own cannibalistic human underground dwellers. She is a Wilson. The invisible people in 'C.H.U.D.' were the homeless. Who are the C.H.U.D.'s supposed to be in 'Us'?John Landis directed 'Time Out', the first segment of 'Twilight Zone: The Movie', which starred Vic Morrow, who in the course of a single night learns what it's like to be on the receiving end of institutionalized racism at its most vehement. First, he's Jewish, then Vietnamese, then Black. The unrepentant racist is shot at, dehumanized, forsaken and forgotten, made invisible; a rumor. Landis also directed the long-form video for Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'. The t-shirt that the named one wore on the night she was replaced by a counterfeit Adelaide is the key to understanding 'Us'. They're not zombies, remember; they're Americans, as Red had already explained. Red describes herself, and the people she lives with as 'shadows'. Shadows, in the pejorative sense of the word, can be a slur for Mexican and Central American immigrants. 'In the Service of Shadows' is a making-of documentary film for Gregory Nava's 'El Norte', a film about two Guatemalan illegals, down and out in Los Angeles. Jordan Peele knows 'El Norte'. It's no coincidence that 'Us' takes place in southern California. Peele, as aforementioned, is the heir apparent to Quentin Tarantino, a postmodernist filmmaker who knows how to knit his motion pictures into a celluloidal patchwork quilt with panache. The journey is shorter; the shadows' trip is a matter of taking the escalator; it's the trip from Mexico to the United States in miniature. The flashback, late in 'Us', shows the relationship between Americans and shadow Americans. For every person at the carnival, there is a double, pantomiming every body movement, trying in vain to be 'us', not 'them'. The C.H.U.D.'s in 'Us' are people on the border, right now as I write this. Peele triangulates 'El Norte' with 'C.H.U.D.' In essence, Rosa(Zaide Silva Guiterrez) and Enrique(David Villapiando) are homeless. Everybody in Tijuana is homeless. To reach the United States, the 'coyote'(Mike Gomez) makes the Guatemalan natives crawl through a sewer pipe. They're homeless people in a sewer; it's an amalgamation; it's 'El C.H.U.D.' Enrique and Rosa are shadows. Mexico is the shadow. Central America is another shadow. The C.H.U.D.'s in 'Us' embody Bill Connor(Vic Morrow) in Landis' segment of 'Twilight Zone: The Movie'. White, black, yellow; they all learn what it's like to be brown. Conversely, in 'El Norte', both Rosa and Enrique pantomime; they both want to be American. Rosa, a maid, goes through the motions of starting the washing machine. but it doesn't start. Enrique, a waiter at a high-end restaurant, enters the kitchen from the dining room through a swinging door, then pretends to serve coffee to customers while using rudimentary English. Peele seized on this for the flashback scene.Peele also uses Tarantino's penchant for revenge fantasies. Like 'Unglorious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained', them gets back at us in Grand Guignol style. And here is the cherry on the cake. When Adelaide was a child, 'Hands Across America' made a big impression on her. It was 1986; Ronald Reagan's second term. She organizes her own version in 2019. The chain extends out into the ocean. Peele is a genius. These C.H.U.D.'s can't breathe underwater. It's symbolic.These C.H.U.D.'s are reaching out to Puerto Rico.",10,7,17,4 April 2019
Aquaman," Becca goes through the rabbit hole
","Becca(Nicole Kidman) fell into a rabbit hole. The young man who ran over her little boy was right about alternate universes. 'If space is infinite,' he tells the grieving mother, 'anything is possible'. The title of the film derives from a comic book that Jason(Miles Tenner) created. The plot synopsis goes like this: A boy's father dies. He was a scientist who uncovered a system of interconnected holes to alternate universes. The boy goes looking for him. In one of the panels, from behind a tree, he spies on a man who is indistinguishable from his dad, but it's not dad, interacting with duplicates of mom and himself. He is both here and there, an audience of one watching an actor play the story of his life. The tree is a demarcation; a metaphor for a bunched-up curtain pushed to one side, which separates him from the domestic scene playing out in the front yard. It could be a scene based on real life, his life, from the universe he just departed from. As a passive observer, in a sense, it's like almost being able to touch the movie screen, the filmic world that lies beyond it, a double for the world we live in. To the boy, it's an imitation of life, an adaptation, but in this movie, the screen has no negative space, filled with actors, dopplegangers unaware of their multiplicity, who play the same people from other galaxies. He is an extra; he knows not to walk pass the tree and walk into the 'mis-en-scene'.The more you think about it, every film is like an alternate universe. For Kidman. sitting at the Palais in Cannes, or in this case, Comic-Con, she sees her twin, just like that boy watching life unfold and go on without him, objectively...and subjectively. It's still her; it's just another version, a queen from Atlantis. The boy, confronted with seeing himself being played by 'himself', an impersonator, he can't be objective. Gestures, delivery of words, comportment; all these actions are second-guessed, as would an actress. Films, being what they are, self-contained worlds where anything can happen, and in theory, interconnected, with the actor in his/her many guises being the linchpin, Kidman, theoretically finds the portal that allows her to be an Irish immigrant('Far and Away'), a sociopathic broadcast journalist('To Die For'), a courtesan('Moulin Rouge'), or a grieving mother('Rabbit Hole'). In 'Aquaman', she is a princess who can breathe underwater and kick ass on land.The lighthouse keeper finds a strange woman splayed out on the rocks. Tom(Tememura Morrison) presumes she washed-up on shore. He is orientated to think horizontally. But for the sake of phantasmagorical thinking, imagine a scenario in which Becca, similar to the waitress from the A-ha music video for 'Take On Me', finds passage into the comic book? Furthermore, accepting that hypothetical, imagine again, if 'Rabbit Hole', the comic book, not the film(or the play it was based on) was adapted for the screen and was renamed 'Aquaman'.She fell from the sky. She landed on her back. She tumbled out of a wormhole. She is on the same mission as Jason's stand-in, the illustrated boy; to be reunited with a loved one. Becca gets her wish. In 'Rabbit Hole', she muses aloud, 'Somewhere out there, I'm having a good time.' Becca is an atheist. It's science that comforts her. Becca wants to see her child, not in heaven, but in another world because in another world, Danny is alive. Becca despises angels. If you think about it, they're not much different from the undead. Angels are like flying zombies. Becca wants to undo what as a parent she feels is a transgression. As Queen Atlanna, she gets to start a family all over again. This time, mother keeps son safe, making up for the day she forgot to latch the gate. The atonement is all the more impressive, owing to the degree of difficulty. It takes more than locking the door to keep King Orm's soldiers from bringing harm to her son. She kicks, punches, and throws these invaders all over the house. In 'Rabbit Hole', beyond the white picket fence, beyond the road where Danny was run over, is the ocean. The mother, a transfigured woman, the queen of Atlantis, watches her son emerge from the water. For Becca, it fulfills a wish from her own world; to see Danny walk through the fence door. Redemption, at last. Finally, the long-awaited hug, the clinch from another universe.",5,1,2,12 January 2019
"I, Tonya"," Slam poetry in motion
","'I, Tonya' breaks the fourth wall. It uses direct address. Tonya talks to you. Tonya has a grudge to settle with you. Throughout the film, Margot Robbie breaks character with in-scene commentary from her future self. This is how 'I, Tonya' works. Robbie, in essence, plays two roles: Tonya Harding, and the actress who plays Tonya Harding. The faux-documentary version of the present-day ex-skater, the Portland, Oregon native that Robbie channels during sit-down interviews with an off-screen 'documentary filmmaker'(the director also plays two roles), overlap into the biopic proper, the narrative, in which a wizened Harding seated in her kitchen, sucking down Marlboro after Marlboro, reflects on her younger self. The interjections are 20/20 enlightenments, the hindsight that a spousal abuse victim acquires after years of unlearning the learned. She was an accidental co-conspirator; she was the protagonist in The Crystals' song 'He Hit Me and It Felt Like A Kiss'. The interjections can also refute the situational action of the unfolding narrative. 'This is bull****, I never did this,' Tonya says, after she fires a rifle at her husband, the fallible narrator, who purports the incident to have happened. Jeff Gillooly(Sebastian Stan) lies to us. Jeff Gillooly tries to change history. Tonya's abusive husband says, 'I never hit her.' And sadly, there are people who will believe him. And that's because, in her mother's own words, Tonya Harding looked like 'a bull-dyke'. The tomboy reminds Lavona(Allison Janney) that, hair down or hair up, she is indeed young, twenty-three years young. When the Hardings are stopped by the police, the still-fresh blood streaking down Tonya's face should be clearly visible to the presiding cop. This officer points the flashlight towards the occupied passenger seat, but he doesn't even bother to ask a courtesy question about the battered woman's disheveled state. The cop takes one look at the 'Charles Barkley of figure skating'(called so by Jeff) because Tonya possesses an unrivaled physicality that allows her to land the triple axel, and figures this woman, who is, frankly, a little on the masculine side, can handle herself and dish it out for good measure. And yes, Harding does resemble a waitress at some greasy spoon who never calls the mechanic to fix her truck. If Tonya Harding is guilty of anything, it's not being pretty in dresses like, in her own words, 'a retar*ed tooth fairy'.When all the acidic sensationalism gets squeezed out from this lemon of a story, this made-for-television psychodrama on ice, the last of the dwindling media horde encamped on the perimeter outside the Gillooly house packs up. And we know why. As Jeff peers through venetian blinds, we catch a glimpse of the next ratings bonanza glowing from the boob tube aside from him. A covered body is being pulled on a wheeled stretcher into the coroner's van from the compound of a famed ex-NFL running back. 'I, Tonya' picks up where the coda for 'Natural Born Killers' leaves off; that bravura 'year in review' stories Oliver Stone encapsulates in an A.D.D.-like channel surfing montage that underscores the decline of broadcast news and the general public's hunger for violence. In this sequence, both the O.J. trial and the Kerrigan/Harding brouhaha are included, along with the Menendez brothers, Waco, and Lorena Bobbitt, tabloid stories all, given the patina of mainstream respectability because, as the 'Hard Copy' reporter puts it: 'For the first time there was a 24-hour news cycle to fill.' Appropriately enough, Harding would become a lady boxer, the perfect metaphor for this new wave of journalism, tabloid journalism, since Kerrigan versus Harding was the undercard for the main event: O.J. Simpson versus the prosecution.'You think those nitwits in Zombieland remember anything?' Wayne Gacy(Robert Downey Jr.) asks a worried subordinate, who edits the latest 'American Maniacs' episode, a hyper-violent extrapolation of 'America's Most Wanted', which, it goes without saying, wouldn't look out of place on the current airwaves. The question is a rhetorical one. The world is turning into the dystopia that Oliver Stone predicted. Click on your flat screen right now. All the president's men just moved the goalposts again. And Martin Maddox(Bobby Cannavale), a cynic in the mode of Wayne Gale, knows, too, that a good portion of the viewing public can't tell. Oliver Stone saw the future. 'I, Tonya' confirms what 'Natural Born Killers' intuited over two decades ago, which was that Sidney Lumet's 'Network', a speculative film about the merging of news and entertainment , and the relationship between the media and its audience, was far out, 'til time caught up, and then, wasn't far out enough.Some people can't remember what happened yesterday. Let alone, remember the incident. Jeff Gillooly claims that there are people who believe it was Harding herself who whacked Nancy Kerrigan behind her knee with a metal rod. 'I, Tonya' sets the record straight. Derrick Smith(Anthony Reynolds) and Shane Stant(Ricky Russert), out-of-state acquaintances of Harding's bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt(Paul Walter Hauser), are the 'boobs' who executed the 'hit' job. If the figure skater and her husband were guilty of anything, it was stupidity, Boobs, meant in the pejorative sense as 'stupid' people, a description apropos of this muddled redneck crime outfit, can also mean television personalities. Mickey and Mallory are boobs. Across the bodies of these serial killers, Stone superimposes the words in white light lettering 'too much television' before Mickey accidentally shoots the Indian. Wayne Gale, because he reenacts the couple's murders on 'American Maniacs', turns these criminals into stars, ascending stars, whereas Tonya Harding was in descent, a falling star, that the cable news outlets followed until she fell to earth. Mickey, as played by Woody Harrelson, in the midst of a full-scale prison riot, subtly breaks character, when he says: 'Murder, it's pure, but you made it unpure.' That is Oliver Stone speaking, in his own voice. Harrelson is just a puppet. 'Media's like the weather, but it's man-made weather,' Mickey continues. That is still Stone; his hand, firmly entrenched inside the puppet head. For someone from his generation, a man who can recognize the breaching norms, the very idea of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite, giants in their industry, reading from a teleprompter about warring figure skaters was a litmus test. Stone couldn't picture this. It was beyond the pale. Maddox would agree. The 'Hard Copy' reporter knows that these boobs were straight out of central casting. The media turned a light drizzle into a Category 5 hurricane.The audience threw roses at Alexis Winston(Lynn Holly-Johnson). The blind girl skates over the flowers, then falls. Her boyfriend comes down from the stands. He helps her up. The crowd cheers as they take a victory lap around the rink. Tonya Harding, needless to say, would not have been asked to audition for 'Ice Castles'. She doesn't look the part. Jeff leaves a trail of rose petals that lead to a refrigerator stocked to the gills with Dove bars. Ice cream on a stick is as good as it gets. She is not properly loved. She deserves better.From her mother.From men.From America.Tonya Harding may not have looked like a princess, but she sure skated like one, to ZZ Top music and blue nail polish.",10,3,5,9 February 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Young Americans
","Glass shatters at a Brooklyn pizza joint after Mookie tosses a garbage can into his master's house. It's retribution for the blue and white murder of Radio Raheem. Mookie can't coexist in both worlds anymore. He heeds his best friend's advice. 'Stay black,' Buggin' Out tells the pizza delivery boy, early on in 'Do the Right Thing', Spike Lee's third and best-known film, because he wants Mookie to quit his job and support the boycotting of Sal's Pizzeria. Buggin' Out despises Sal, but that pizza joint is the hangout place where he and his gang have been frequenting since they were knee-high. It's a ritual, a foregone choice everybody makes in the Bedford-Stuy cul-de-sac without self-introspection. But then you get older, and for somebody like Buggin' Out, the apolitical turns political. Suddenly, the place where you eat your slice matters. Before he takes his first bite, Buggin' Out looks at Sal's 'Hall of Fame', as if for the first time. 'How come there ain't no brothers on the wall?' the disgruntled patron asks Sal, adding that it's black folks, not Italians who spend 'much money' at his inner-city eatery. Sal, so incensed at being tested, comes out from behind the counter wielding a baseball bat that Pino subtly removes from his father's hands. An audience may misread the older son, since his animosity towards the clientele is no secret. And yet, he staves off the inevitable until closing time, when Sal makes good on his promise: 'I'm going to kill somebody today.' Sal is the unabashed bigot, latent racism brought to light by circumstantial fate. Pino is not his father. When Buggin' Out suggests that Michael Jordan's likeness be inducted to Sal's hallowed wall, Pino smiles, in covert solidarity. Admiration for the Bulls guard is a bridge that the Bensonhurst native doesn't dare cross, in spite of a desire for camaraderie, because what would his friends back home say? Larry Bird fans, the whole lot, probably. Pino has more in common with the black community he purports to despise than the brownstone-owning white bicyclist donning a Celtics jersey who runs over Buggin' Out's immaculate Air Jordans with his ten-speed.Because of peer pressure, Pino is expected to denounce Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power' because of Chuck D.'s pointed takedown of Elvis Presley and John Wayne. And yet, he is curiously neutral as Radio Raheem turns the volume up on the anthemic rap song, while his father undergoes an emotional meltdown about the noise pollution. Mookie knows Pino's secret. All of his coworker's heroes are black. He puts him to the test. Sal answers: 'Magic Johnson...Eddie Murphy,' before Pino catches on to the methodology behind Mookie's inquiry and switches gears, claiming that 'Bruce', not Prince, as his favorite rock star. The racist slurs are a cover. 'Down deep inside,' Pino hates his olive-skinned complexion. Mookie guesses: 'I think you wish you were black,' just like Vito, the younger brother, who probably uses black lingo to greet Mookie every morning. Vito is out, in regard to fluidity with racial dialects and identities. But even he can't quote Louis Farrakhan, accurately. It's Pino, more so than the Korean grocer, who can lay claim to being the 'same', to being 'black'. When Pino quotes the Minister Louis Farrakhan: 'We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past,' Mookie doesn't blink an eyelid. Pino's charade of flubbing the Nation of Islam's leader's name with several false starts doesn't fool him. After all, he notes, Pino's hair is kinkier than his. It's the father, not the son, who has no interest in African-American culture. Pino probably has a begrudging respect for the aesthetics of rap music. The shopkeeper and his wife, conversely, loathed Radio Raheem. The C/D battery incident, Sweet Dick Willie has no knowledge of, when he calms the angry mob with fire on their minds. 'The Korean is all right,' he tells his friend ML. The Korean is not all right. During the sequence in which ethnic group representatives hurl racial epithets at each other, Sonny expresses a disdain for Jewish people. The grocer imitates Ed Koch with a sustained vitriol that has more in common with a Nazi-era German than some contemporary African-American Brooklynite. 'I no white,' he pleads with the converging dark-skinned locals, swinging a dust mop to fend off the riff-raff. But the emigre will say anything to save his livelihood and life, by any means necessary.'Europa Europa', the 1990 historical war drama by Agnieszka Holland, could be dubbed 'Do the Prudent Thing'. Life during wartime means having to modify your moral universe. Solomon Perel, a Polish Jew, is the survivor-type. When German planes attack a Bolshevik convoy, Solly hides under a truck to avoid Luftwaffe bullets. The vehicle carrying the Communist reactionaries pulls away, stranding him among the walking dead. Inna knows her comrade's fate; he will succumb to Nazi capture. She rolls Solly a red apple. Metaphorically speaking, an apple with skin intact is like an uncircumcised p****; an apple without skin is a circumcised p****. Skin is the difference between life and death. It's something to worry about in the future. But, for now, Solly tells the sergeant his name is Josef Peters, a German, of Baltic German descent, a dark-haired Aryan with Latvian roots. Whereas the Korean grocer knows enough English to bamboozle the African-American throng with his claim of solidarity based on non-whiteness, Solly is fluent in both Russian and German, which helps corroborate his tall-tale about being reprogrammed by Soviet captors and deposited in an orphanage where he received a Communist-minded education as a member of Komsomol, a political youth organization. Out on the battlefield, Solly never picks up a gun, but instead, works as a translator. He fights on the same side as the very people who killed his family. Kellerman, his buddy, gives him a haircut, which evokes the couplet: 'I changed my hairstyle so many times now/I don't know what I look like,' from 'Life During Wartime', a Talking Heads song that aptly describes the cons of collaboration. Solly loses his religion. An accidental war hero, 'Josef' is transferred to a prestigious Third Reich school, where he pledges allegiance to a bust of the fuhrer as a prerequisite for joining the Hitler Youth. He falls in love with a Nazi maiden, Leni. It's not until the Waffen-SS recruit passes a desecrated Jewish graveyard, where all the headstones are dug up to the delight of his girlfriend, does he finally wake up from an Aryan-induced trance. It's not Josef, but Solomon, his former-self, who slaps Leni. The girl from Germany, the boy from Poland learns, would slit his throat if she discovered what he was. Josef's attempt to sew the helmet back on ends in discoloration. The apple has no skin.The Klan advertises in a Colorado Springs daily, so Ron Stallworth cold-calls the KKK, and just like that, presto, he gets Walter on the line. To fool the regional Klan leader, Ron uses the king's English in a Caucasian-accented voice as he launches into a diatribe about his hatred for '******s' and '***s'. Ron's gift for impersonation is so convincing, his colleagues stop what they're doing and openly gawk at their new colleague. Where does it come from, this gift for mimicry; this performative hate monologue? It comes, no doubt, from spending a lot of time around white folks. Ron lived a sheltered life; he grew up on a military base. The ex-army brat tells Chief Bridges and a black recruitment agent that 'my parents raised me the right way,' coded talk for the white way. He shares with Mr. Turrentine, the characteristic of being at a far remove from the radicalism of their peers. These soul brothers; these soul sisters, grew up as targets. That's why Ron answers: 'Will that happen, sir?' when Turrentine asks about his conduct should another cop call him a '******'. Ron's black experience was blanched of color. For the first time in his life, he encounters the same casual racism just like any other 'Negro'. As a rookie, he fetches the files of 'toads' in the records department, back and forth, like a trained dog. On assignment as an undercover detective, Ron doesn't know that the ex-Black Panther changed his name to Kwame Ture, the radical he has been tasked with monitoring. He wants to cut to the front. That's privilege. Patrice, the Black Student Union president, tells Ron to stand in the back of the line like everybody else. Patrice doesn't know what the audience knows, which is that this new recruit wasn't raised to fight the power. Kwame's words 'stop running away from being black' hits Ron square in the mind's eye. It's what made him join the police force; to transcend his skin color. Ron realizes that he identifies with Tarzan, as Kwame did as a youngster, when it's the savages, who are the corrective analogues for blacks in the seventies. 'Superfly' is Ron's favorite flick. Patrice corrects him; a pimp can't be a hero. 'The image does damage to our people,' she warns. Ron, however, identifies with Blaxploitation films more so than black leaders. He would rather be John Shaft than W.E.B. DuBois. Ron is the frantic Korean grocer screaming: 'I black. You. Me. Same.' No. Hell, no. Ron and Patrice are not the same. 'Right on,' the cop shouts, in unison with the students, like an awakening.To fool the KKK, Ron needs a body to go with his voice. Flip is not only Ron's partner, but a projection of himself. In the locker room, they rehearse. Ron, a black man, instructs Flip on how to sound like a Protestant Anglo-Saxon. It's not as crazy as it sounds. Flip is Jewish. Like Pino, all of his heroes are black. Ron chants: 'Say it loud/I'm black/I'm proud,' as a sort of connective tissue to Pino.Eventually, bringing down the Klan becomes a crusade for Flip, too. His awakening is ingrained in the film's title. Look at the lower-case 'k'.'BlacKkKlansman'.Dig?Pizzerias.Crosses.Auschwitz.",9,3,6,9 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Woman is the force
","We're not just voyeurs; we're also flies on the wall. Our ears tell us that the male ghost on this remote island is not being honest about what transpired the last time he laid eyes on this corporeal woman. Our eyes can register that the woman isn't just cutting the dead man some slack as he rebuilds his legacy; she is aiding and abetting the disconnect between past and present. The girl has amnesia. It's no Jedi mind trick. There was a disturbance in cyberspace, last time around. Rey(Daisy Ridley) and everybody else in this galaxy far, far away, unbeknownst to them, are in a matrix, which changes the trajectory of the narrative that restores Luke Skywalker's reputation as the fearless hero, and reduces the unflappable heroine into a young woman, suddenly stricken with self-doubts, who needs mentoring to help reach her full potential.Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) tells Rey(Daisy Ridley): 'A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect,' when she tries to toss the light saber into the ocean. Pretty smug, this attitude, these scolding words, coming from the same guy who at the outset of Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi', flips the returned Jedi weapon nonchalantly over his shoulder and down a steep cliff. The pilgrimage to find Luke that Rey had made for the resistance, ends with an inauspicious first meeting. Sure, Luke comes around eventually, keeping the First Order at bay, as a hologram, on a bleeding salt flat, in which he dies a conquering hero. But not before Rey reminds Luke of who he once was. In J.J. Abrams' 'The Rise of Skywalker', Luke says: 'It's fear that kept me here,' which on the surface, is more or less true, but the source of the fear differs from 'The Last Jedi'. Imminent death, the potentiality of being stricken down in battle wasn't Luke's reason for being afraid. It was his faith, not fate. 'The Rise of Skywalker' obfuscates the underlying cause of the Jedi Master's self-imposed isolationism. General Leia Organa(Carrie Fisher) and her rebel cohorts never learn the truth about Luke's plan, with Yoda's blessings, to secularize 'The Force', and deny its exclusivity from future Jedi Knights, such as Rey. 'The Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies is vanity.' During her abbreviated training session, really, a crash course, in the penultimate film, Rian Johnson, working from his own script, demythologizes the 'Star Wars' saga, in which Luke downplays the importance of his kind. Suddenly, Rey feels like a go-between instead of a living God. But in 'The Rise of Skywalker', all this doubt and conflict about the righteousness inherent, or not inherent, in regard to the Jedi religion is gone from Luke's mind. 'Confronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi, your destiny,' he says without self-consciousness, forgetting about the abdication of his duty to mentor Rey. The girl is Leia's burden. After mishandling Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), Han Solo and Leia's son, who was seduced by 'The Dark Side', Luke can't handle the ramifications of another failure. Should the former Ben Solo possess Rey, the blame then falls on General Leia's shoulders, not his. Can he live with himself? For the time being, yes, when Rey leaves the island with Chewbacca, newly-converted to vegetarianism. 'The Last Jedi', to the outrage of a vocal majority, addressed the provocative idea that the Jedi religion could be both good and bad in equal proportions. The Jedis, paradoxically, make up the galaxy's greatest heroes and its most heinous villains. In 'The Rise of Skywalker', however, the nagging doubts that haunted Luke in the winter of his life never happened. His fatalism, in death, is gone; he never asks the pertinent question: 'Are we the problem?' The Sith, The Empire, The First Order; these are all byproducts of The Force.Uncharacteristically, Rey leaves her Resistance friends in a lurch during their greatest time of need. She can grieve over General Leia's passing back at the rebel base. A Jedi Knight, surely, has the power to compartmentalize, the innate ability to separate personal feelings of loss from professional obligations which make the difference between life and death for so many. While she mourns, Emperor Palpatine(Ian Diarmid) puts his endgame into action with a tyranny-free D'Quar on the line in a galaxy far, far away. But since it's Rey, a girl, who deprograms Kylo Ren from his learned dark lessons with Snoke(Andy Serkis), the supreme leader, the extra-diegetic world of the audience needs placating, since it suggests that Rey is more powerful than Luke Skywalker, their childhood hero. The hold in which Snoke had on Ben Solo, in 'The Last Jedi', was uncontrollable under Luke's tutelage, whereas Rey possesses the raw benevolent power to clean up the mess perpetuated by the legendary Jedi Master, the man responsible for creating Kylo Ren. To go from one triumph to an even greater triumph, without exhibiting any human weakness would be too much for matrix bystanders, therefore, as a courtesy to the patriarchy, Rey makes a detour to Ach-to, better known as Skywalker Island. This plot point puts the female hero back in her place. Luke inspires the uncharacteristically frightened young woman at the expense of rewriting Rey, who in 'The Force Awakens', displays her irritation every time Finn(John Boyega) grabs her hand as they evade enemy capture at the Jakku marketplace. Quite pointedly, as visual punctuation, a filmic exclamation point, Rey helps the fallen renegade stormtrooper up by offering 'her' hand. In 'The Rise of Skywalker', Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac), Leia's second-in-command, concedes the leadership position, since Rey's light saber better illuminates the underground quicksand caverns than the weak light shooting from his emasculating flashlight. Face to face with a sand serpent, Rey employs diplomacy instead of brute force, deploying the benevolent energy of The Force as a salve that heals snake's wounds with her guiding hand instead of blowing the thing away to smithereens. That's a big snake. That's a woman who can take care of herself. But alas, 'The Rise of Skywalker' restores the patriarchal construct which 'The Last Jedi' knocked down. Because of his pep talk, Luke Skywalker, in death, gets to bask in the afterglow of the limelight when Rey, during her climactic battle with Emperor Palpatine, discovers that two light sabers are better than one, when she crosses them, forming a pointed 'x' as an impenetrable shield strong enough to withstand the electrical currents shooting out of the surprisingly alive old man's wrinkled fingers, while inching forward incrementally, until she is close enough to kill him with his own dark energy. Kills her too, until Ben Solo climbs out from the rubble and resurrects Rey, like how she resurrected him back at the pier. A man can resurrect the dead just as well as a woman. Ben doesn't bring his true love and dyad back to life with a Prince Charming-like kiss, but the resemblance to classical male hero tropes will not be lost on the audience. 'The Rise of Skywalker' restores the 'Star Wars' saga back to the sensibilities of the original trilogy, in regard to women: Codependent(Rey), or ornamental(General Leia Organa), whereas in 'The Last Jedi', Vice Admiral Holo(Laura Dern), with no history to heritage to draw on, gives the resistance safe passage by plowing her empty vessel into the First Order's laser cannon-equipped ship.'You have no part in this narrative,' Kylo Ren taunts the Jedi hopeful, as motivation for the orphaned scavenger to make her departure from the resistance and help him oversee the First Order, in 'The Last Jedi'. Rey, an outlier, being so disconnected from the 'Star Wars' universe, dismayed many, since she was integral to the survival of the Jedi religion. Their protestations helped unwrite 'The Last Jedi', reduced to a 'rumor', as if Episode VIII never transpired. The patriarchy, fervent in their ideology, forced a sort of alternate universe, a matrix, in which the franchise's most important character, Luke Skywalker, a deity, gets back to his original roots of pure, unadulterated heroism. Gone are his doubts about the beneficence of the Jedi. As a result, Emperor Palpatine, long-thought to be dead after Darth Vader, in Richard Margand's 'Return of the Jedi', chooses Luke over the former Anakin Skywalker's teacher by throwing him a long ways down the Death Star reactor, somehow survived disintegration and has been alive and well all this time, unbeknownst to both Luke and Leia on the planet Exegol, biding his time. Even Yoda didn't know, apparently. A Jedi Knight would sense Palpatine's existence, you would think, but never mind. Since Rey is being counted on to save the galaxy, she better have some family tie, no matter how convoluted. That is how Rey ends up being Palpatine's secret granddaughter.In Rey's house, a downed AT-Walker, the audience spots a homemade Luke Skywalker doll, a proto-figurine, on her shelf that she probably spun great adventures with as a child. Back then, Luke Skywalker was a myth, a belief not o dissimilar from us, at the outset of 'The Force Awakens'. There's something poignant about Rey being an outsider. She represents every boy and girl who ever played with those miniature replicas of those iconic characters from George Lucas' 'A New Hope'. When Rey meets Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca, it's you and me, living out our childhood fantasies of hugging a Wookie, and helping the rebellion defeat the empire. On some primitive level, we already knew what Han Solo tells the starry-eyed Jakku native: 'It's all true,' just like the small boy looking up towards the heavens for a sign of the Millennium Falcon, zipping across the sky at the end of 'The Last Jedi'. But the true believers, they too saw the fourth wall, and shrank away from it, because they wanted a boy, not some girl, to break it.It's a matrix. The girl from Jakku is not a Skywalker.Just call her Rey.",4,7,11,18 January 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Radio A ma
","'Radio Gaga', the lead single and track from Queen's 1984 album 'The Works' peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100. Although 'Body Language'(#11) and 'Under Pressure'(#29) both charted, the album 'Hot Space' was not critically well-received. 'I Want to Break Free', the follow-up single to 'Radio Ga Ga', despite being mid-tempo ear candy to the rest of the world, the exceedingly radio-friendly song, written by bassist John Deacon, stalled at #45, the last time Queen, fronted by the late Freddie Mercury, ever came close to further cultivating their status as American radio mainstays and stateside hitmakers. The music video which accompanied 'I Want to Break Free' made them non-grata to disc jockeys and more importantly, MTV, alike. The music industry preferred the lead singer's personal politics to remain latent. Ironically, it was drummer Roger Taylor's idea that the whole band go drag for the fateful video shoot, a parody of 'Coronation Street', a BBC soap opera, but MTV gave 'I Want to Break Free' little support, effectively turning this highly-successful London band into dinosaurs, a nostalgia act that could coast all the way to the bank, getting by with playing all their old hits from yesteryear. But on the other side of the Atlantic, Queen's popularity never wavered. 'Bohemian Rhapsody', directed by Bryan Singer, ends prematurely with their legendary Live Aid performance at Wembley, as if Freddy Mercury(Raim Malek), diagnosed with the HIV virus, died shortly after the world was fed in 1985. The show, however, went on for another six years. Longtime Queen fans will be distracted by the filmmaker's decision to play fast and loose with the timeline, like a Brian May guitar solo. Dramatizing the relative malaise of late-period Queen('A Kind of Magic' and 'The Miracle') would have been difficult, but surely, time compression could have made allowances for their final recording sessions that resulted in the formation of 'Innuendo', the band's swan song. Rock me, Farrokh Bulsara still had six more years of being a 'virtuoso' and 'rock idol' left in the tank. Why stop him now?On a daily basis, Tom Hulce practiced the piano upwards to five or six hours, prep work that he diligently maintained in preparation for his career-making role as 18th century Viennese superstar Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Milos Forman's 1984 adaptation of the Paul Shaffer play 'Amadeus'. That's really him playing 'Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor' upside down on his back. More than once, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' alludes to the 1985 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, by positioning Freddie Mercury as man of prodigious talent with a god-given ability for musical transcendence. 'Somebody to Love' from 'A Day in the Races'(1976), anyone? And very close behind: 'Bohemian Rhapsody', a six-plus-minute quasi-opera which would become the centerpiece of Queen's fourth album 'A Night at the Opera', makes an aural cameo when pre-fame Freddie, sharing a modest flat with Mary Austin(Lucy Boynton), his girlfriend, plays the opening notes in their bed, just like Mozart, upside down at a costume party, a flamboyant party, the same bacchanal ones that Mercury would someday throw in his mansion. It's possible, sure, that Mercury started work, as a germ of an idea, on the film's namesake prior to being signed, but since the filmmaker uses his artistic license to manipulate chronological time for maximum dramatic effect, we have our doubts. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has a musical maturity that is leaps and bounds ahead of 'Keep Yourself Alive' and 'Doing All Right'(both from their s/t debut), songs that predate Queen and the addition of bassist John Deacon(Joseph Mazzello), when May and Roger Taylor(Ben Hardy) were still playing dive pubs as Smile. Sounding not unlike William Miller(Patrick Fugit), just before he crosses over from fan to player, in Cameron Crowe's 'Almost Famous', Freddie, a groupie, more or less, ingratiates himself to Brian and Roger, when after a gig, he approaches them in the parking lot, flattering his future bandmates by knowing their names and something about Smile. He replaces Tim Staffel(Jack Roth), who just quit. This part of the story checks out. What doesn't check out is that they'd play 'Fat Bottomed Girls'(which wouldn't appear until 1978's 'Jazz') on their first American tour, and suggesting that the disco-fueled 'Another One Bites the Dust' appeared on 'Hot Space'(1982) instead of 'The Game'(1980), their best-selling album. Most egregious of all is the complete fabrication of Queen walking out on EMI, based on the flimsy and ludicrous premise that Ray Foster(Michael Myers), the label's head honcho, wanted to release 'You're My Best Friend' instead of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' as the lead single. Mercury, the genius, treats the fictional executive like a mediocrity: Antonio Salieri to his Mozart.'Amadeus' got it wrong, too. Antonio Salieri(F. Murray Abraham), the court composer for Emperor Joseph II(Jeffrey Jones) was far from the patron saint of mediocrity that Milos Forman makes him out to be. The penultimate sequence in 'Amadeus' is bogus. Salieri transcribes Mozart's 'Requiem' as the great composer notably grows increasingly sick from overwork, burning the midnight oil until his fire goes out at first dawn's early rise. That's not the truth. As Penny Lane(Kate Hudson) would say: 'Isn't it funny? The truth just sounds different.' Mozart and Salieri weren't friends, but they certainly weren't rivals either. The truth about Freddie Mercury was that he lived with AIDS for two years prior to finishing work on 'Innuendo' in November '90. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' misses out on the inherent drama and pathos of Mercury singing, possibly for the last time, 'The Show Must Go On', the band's seventh and last single from their fourteenth and final album.The show did go on after Live Aid, but for whatever reason, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ends with a false happy ending, a real bum note.",4,3,7,5 February 2020
Yesterday," Mania no no no
","The late-sixties was barely breathing, but it still had a pulse, until Mark David Chapman(Jonas Bell) walked into a public library and began the process of pulling the plug. The security guard, the librarian, the other patrons: How could they have known that a madman was in their midst? Nobody looks like an assassin until they become one. He was 'Nowhere Man'. He was on an island. Chapman perused the fiction stacks, looking for 'some kind of guidance' as he scrutinized authors and titles inscribed on spines, overlooking and sparing those works of literature the infamy of being weaponized. The Church of Scientology, we learn in Mark Piddington's 'The Killing of John Lennon', was located right across the street from where Chapman worked as a security guard. He made repeated crank calls to its worshippers. Chapman believed that God should not take the form of a living author. And yet, he misconceived 'The Catcher in the Rye' as a sacred text, unconsciously appropriating J.D. Salinger's words as scripture. The irony eluded Chapman. Unlike The Church of Scientology's founder, Salinger never claimed to be a prophet. Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen who 'was surrounded by phonies' wanted to kill himself, not other people. Chapman misinterpreted 'The Catcher in the Rye', afflicted he was with a Holden Caulfield complex, the same as any religious crackpot, when he gunned down John Lennon outside The Dakota Apartments in NYC, circa 1980. Lennon was one of the phonies, according to Chapman. If the deranged young man listened to 'God', an album track from 'John Lennon & The Plastic Ono Band', and not the Salinger of his own making, he would have known not to 'believe in Beatles'. People loved The Beatles. People loved John Lennon. But in Salinger's own words: 'People are always ruining things for you.'Rose Petrofsky(Wendie Jo Sperber) knows which mop top is left-handed. She begs Larry(Mark McClure) to stop the car so she can yell 'Paul' into a pay phone and win free tickets to 'The Ed Sullivan Show'. Stock footage of screaming, hormonally super-charged young girls on black and white celluloid only tell half the story of Beatlemania, a pop culture supernova that started in earnest, but spread like a tempestuous wildfire, when the Pan Am that carried the four lads from Liverpool touched ground at JFK on February 4, 1964. 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand', the 1978 feature film debut by Robert Zemeckis, colors the disease by foregrounding those young women who lost it at the radio. Rose always carries a treasure trove of dimes in her pocket for a situation such as this. She intends on feeding one at the closest coin slot. Rose's condition is reaching critical mass. She threatens to jump. They don't believe her. Pam(Nancy Allen), Rose's best friend, should know better. Back at the record store, where vinyl copies of 'Meet the Beatles' are selling like hotcakes, Pam witnesses her pal scream at a passing cardboard likeness of Paul. Cardboard, a processed paper good, simulacrum even more analog than the image on a movie screen or television set, puts Rose in a spasmodic bit of hair-trigger frenzy that bespeaks of an idolization that transcends the ordinary love you feel for your lover, your parent, or your pet. It was, quite simply, utter madness. Grace(Theresa Saldana), an aspiring photojournalist, insists that Larry drive on, and in the next instant, the film depicts how Beatlemania, at the outset, was a contagion without no known cure. Rose makes good on her threat. Janis(Susan Kendall Newman), the folk music aficionado, a proto-hippie who loves Bob Dylan, shrieks. Tony(Bobby DiCicco), a greaser out of time, can't believe that the girl riding shotgun propelled herself onto hard pavement from a moving vehicle, Later in the film, unfairly, it's Pam, engaged and not even half the devotee that her daredevil friend is, who sneaks into the Beatles' room at The Plaza Hotel. Suddenly, alone with men's things, famous men, something primal switches on inside her. Lascivious in nature, albeit abstract, like a concuspiscent groupie, Pam cheats on her husband, and worse, Rose, when she takes off her engagement ring and performs something resembling foreplay to Paul's bass guitar. At the 'Ed Sullivan Show' taping, after 'She Loves You' recedes into memory, Pam sobs quietly. The sweet single-minded love she lavished on the Hofner is consummated. She grips her skirt while the others help Rose recover from a fainting spell. Richard(Eddie Dezeen), a memorabilia collector Rose meets at the hotel, loves Ringo. Rose and Pam, both, love Paul; one like a silly schoolgirl, one like a cosmopolitan woman. Grace loves George. And finally, there is Janis, the future flower child, who is so mystified at Rose's lack of social consciousness when she cuts off Peter, Paul & Mary in mid-song with the thoughtless turn of a car radio knob. Someday, she will love John, and cry the hardest on that fateful day in December, when Yoko Ono lost a husband, Sean lost a father, and the yuppies lost their bridge to yesterday.Should the world forgive Mark David Chapman? No. That's an irrevocable no. 'Watching the Wheels', the third single off 'Double Fantasy' was climbing the Top 40 when Chapman gunned down Lennon with hollow point bullets, in the back. 'The Killing of John Lennon', albeit exploitative, works as a docudrama; it gets all the details right. Chapman meets the icon twice. John(Richard Sherman) signs his copy of 'Double Fantasy' before he enters the limo, en route to a recording session with his wife. How could Lennon have known that he just signed his last autograph. When the ex-Beatle returns and sees Chapman loitering outside his apartment complex, he probably though the young man wanted another one. Chapman, serving twenty-years-to-life in a New York state penitentiary, continues to be turned down for parole, despite his repeated public affirmations of remorse for what he did yesterday, nearly four decades ago. 'Yesterday', directed by Danny Boyle, has the unintended but unfortunate effect of being a fantasy that, arguably, benefits Chapman, because in this alternate universe, he is free as a bird.'It burned in my head; it was like an electric current passing through my body,' the killer narrates, as he clutches the book to his chest; he continues: 'and lighting up all the cells in my brain.' Chapman, a born-again Christian, gets to be Holden for real, in an extra-diegetical sense, because this time he does 'catch everybody if they go over the cliff,' instead of that ugly doppleganger who drops them. Who is watching the wheels on the bicycle that Jack Malik(Hamesh Patel) rides when he slams into a bus? 'Yesterday' can be read as Mark David Chapman's double fantasy. A worldwide blackout corresponds to the assassin's described high wattage overkill as if Chapman is some intradiegetic narrator who telekinetically recontextualizes the cells that light up his brain. The world stops spinning, 'til he says spin. It's just like starting over. Why Jack, a mediocre singer-songwriter who calls it quits to the disappointment of Ellie, his manager, after he plays in a seemingly invitation-only tent at some midlevel music festival. Best known, by default, for 'The Summer Song', Salinger fans will recognize that the novel is set in winter. The temporal distance between the hot season and the eighth of December is only equated by the spatial distance; another island in another ocean: Great Britain, the Atlantic, so far away from Mark David Chapman's genesis that ended so apocalyptically. Instead of John Lennon or Paul McCartney, it's the quiet Beatle, George, whom Jack Malik most evokes, since Harrison's attraction to traditional Indian music informed his songwriting, starting with 'Love You To' and ending with 'Within You Without You', a sitar-heavy album track from 'Sgt. Peppers'...', in which The Beatles developed alter-egos, as a means to create some distance from the trappings of fame that engulfed them. The character George adopts for these practitioners of baroque harmonics has a name now: It's Jack Malik. The retired performer wakes up in a hospital, greeted bedside by Ellie, who hands her client a mirror that reveals two missing teeth, a metaphor that signifies the erasure of Lennon/McCartney as songwriters. As Ellie leaves, he asks: 'Will you still love me when I'm 64?' and his bewildered manager wonders aloud about the chronological randomness. Jack was chosen for a reason to be the go-between for fantasy and double fantasy.During that same visit to the library, Mark David Chapman climbed the stairs and picked out a second book; it was a coffee table hardcover about The Beatles. For no particular reason, he targeted John, finding an adventitious link between Holden's notion of phonies, described by Salinger as people who were 'charismatic, wealthy, attractive, and superficial', and the song 'Imagine', in particular, this couplet: 'Imagine no possessions/I wonder if you can/No need for greed or hunger/A brotherhood of man'. 'Imagine', which finished recording in early July for an October release, encompassed the cyclical period that falls under the astrological sign that denotes a lion. Jack is not the only person who remembers the Beatles. Two sentients; one man, one woman, talk with Jack backstage after they interrupt a press conference. The man's name is Leo, Chapman's stand-in. They give the dishonest singer-songwriter the address to John Lennon, alive at 78, an everyman, at peace, in a remote part of England.'Yesterday', without meaning to, validates the madman's grudge against Lennon. At a concert in his hometown, Jack Malik sticks it to the phonies, including his label's A & R woman, and alas, himself. This is the screenplay Chapman would write. Jack, in mid-set, announces to the world that he's not the author.He abides by Lennon's own words: 'Imagine no possessions,' and releases 'his' catalog online for free.Jack Malik is no phony.",1,5,19,2 August 2019
Climax," Rock on
","The woman will die from hypothermia if no one on a snowmobile passes by soon. She needs a St. Bernard, stat; and make sure that dog has a barrel filled with a good stiff brandy. Is she a dancer who got left behind at some bus pit stop? No. At the derelict old building that houses the dance repertoire, every performer is accounted for. The contemporary dance routine, fully staffed, goes off without a hitch. The choreographer seems pleased. So who is she then, this dislocated female in distress, screaming for help? The woman sees imported from another genre, a survival film; a plan crash survivor who went rogue from 'Alive' in search of another diegesis, a parallel oasis with food and water. 'Climax' isn't a survival film, is it? She's not the dancer who came in from the cold; she has no affiliation with this makeshift school for the performing arts. Right? 'Climax' is not your father's 'Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo'. Form-wise, because of the disparateness between the opening scene and the first interior shot, the film could be construed as having the potentiality of being 'Blazing Saddles' in slow-motion, but instead of a western, it's an adventure film that finds itself on a collision course with the musical. The woman's survival is of no consequence. The filmmaker forgets about her. If you forget about her, too, filmmaker Gaspar Noe will be pleased. 'Climax' is a meta-commentary on American film. Noe's latest provocation, with its long uninterrupted takes is the antithesis of 'Flashdance', whose editing style, informed and inspired by MTV, gave audiences short memories and made it harder for people to follow multiple narratives. The woman outside is an inconvenience. The woman's storyline; her progress towards the sanctuary of that derelict old building, gets discarded. She's a red herring. 'To dance right through your life,' to pursue your dreams of dancing on Broadway, 'what a feeling' that must be when you're young and your whole life is ahead of you. 'Climax' never leaves the warehouse. No cutaways to feet in decline, dragging across the snow; feet do what do best, keep the dancer, vertical. It's the final rehearsal, a graduation day without the pomp and ceremony of a gown and cap. The French dance company is taking their show overseas where the lights are brighter and the stakes are higher. Clapping Americans are the most important clappers. The dancers know this. A little fame may be in store for them. But 'Climax' gets off on the wrong foot, so to speak. Get rescued or die. That is not a pertinent question. Peel away the same old rags to riches storyline that's been told since a young hayseed with stars in his eyes said: 'Hey, my uncle has a barn. Let's put on a show.' More or less, 'Climax' is Busby Berkeley's 'Babes in Arms', set to Daft Punk and Aphex Twin.Dance or die? It's not the question the choreographer asks, but it might as well be. 'What would you do without dance in your life,' is the actual question posed to a candidate. 'Suicide,' the female dancer answers to the off-camera voice, Lou(Soufelia Yahoub), the aforementioned choreographer, captured for posterity on VHS tape, during the sit-down part of the audition. Hyperbolic, a little, this patented response, meant to impress the interviewer, but not by much. When the talking head is finally attached the body in perpetual motion, Selva(Sofia Boutella) dances as if her life depended on it. It's the same psychical surgery for the others, as well. Do these young people have a contingency plan should their dreams not go according to their liking? Probably not. They are living in the moment, sweaty day to sweaty day, and party all night, every night. The goal is to be seen by the right people who can propel them from obscurity to stardom. The lights in their rehearsal space doesn't have a lot of wattage. Only the lights in their eyes are bright. The people who populate 'Climax' are living in an Irene Cara fever dream. So which one is Cara's alter-ego Coco? They're all Coco; both the girls and the boys want to be the confident young woman with talent to burn, who sang, 'I'm going to live forever,' in the 1980 Alan Parker film. 'Fame' is fleeting, however, and so is life itself. What will Coco do if her embryonic career as a popular singer doesn't pan out? Alex(Jennifer Beals), the flash dancer, has a trade to fall back on. 'What a feeling,' it must be to know that you can weld. Soldering copper pipes can wait. Hard hat, blow torch, lunch pail, thermos; the accoutrements of a blue-collar worker can stay where it is, untouched, posing for a still life. It's New York or bust; it's time to get out of Pittsburgh. But in Coco's case, Parker suggests, fame may potentially be of the infamous kind. People won't remember her name; they'll remember her alias' name, if even that. At the performance arts high school, Coco has friends and associates. Doris, Ralph and Leroy are her friends, but her collaborator, Bruno Martelli(Lee Curreri) is her associate. Bruno, the portrait of an iconoclast as a young man, arrives at the performing arts school with his synthesizers; his futurist mindset, an affront to establishment types such as Professor Shorofsky(Albert Hague), a proponent of baroque instruments. The proto-EDM artist, in some respects, can be characterized as a forerunner to Daddy(Kiddy Smile), the commonwealth dancers' deejay. Both are part of the vanguard, revolutionaries who make traditional musical outfits ranging from orchestras to four-piece bands obsolete. But whereas Daddy can be a band, who not only spins and manipulates vinyl records, and most importantly, ingratiates himself within the collective whole, as when he leaves his exalted perch behind the turntable to bust a few moves of his own, crossing the boundary between master and servant; Bruno, conversely, likes the concentrated ascendancy that comes with rewriting the rules in his own image, telling Shorofsky: 'Who needs an orchestrar? You can do it all with a keyboard, an amp, and enough power,' as a member of the new order. He doesn't need sheet music of the old masters. He doesn't need a conductor. He broke the baton in two. The sheet music is in tatters; the old masters are granules of putrescent dust in a coffin. He writes the songs, alone. Fast-forward to 1996. Oh, no, the DJ is on acid. Somebody spiked the sangria. Daddy lost control. The techno music playing over the PA system has no oversight. The Prodigy has unchecked power.No one from this group would be caught dead with a Rolling Stones album. The woman in the snow; the woman who is 'Out Here On My Own' crashes the mis-en-scene with her survival narrative in tow, turning 'Climax' into a survival film, after all, a tragi-comic Mel Brooks mash-up. Instead of two soundstages, it's the settings of the single interior and single exterior that converge. The woman who came in from the cold transfixed the cocktails with acid. Unbeknownst to Psyche(Thea Carla Schott), she tracked down her Berlin roommate. The woman in the snow is named, we surmise, is 'Angie', like the song, a rock song, an outlier on the EDM-heavy soundtrack. In Pablo Pier Passolini's 'Salo', the Ennio Morricone score competes with the Frederick Chopin piano pieces that the fascists use as an anesthetizing backdrop for the base and amoral tales they unspool to their young prisoners. Bruno, in a sense, avenges these fascists, theoretically, when he enacts a hegemonic shift from classical to popular. The idealism of a new music language, however, over time, can curdle into demagoguery. Bruno won the fight, the usurpation is complete, the old masters has lost its relevancy, but EDM, the end-result of the young American's pioneering work, turns into music of the ruling class. Angie, in a fight for rock's proletarian soul, co-opts electronica, the music of debauchery; the music of the people that Passolini condemned. She's no fascist; she's an Englishman in drag. Mick Jagger fighting Keith Flynt, or rather, an imitation of Flynt, alive in the grooves of a record that the deejay spins on his turntable.Angie goes through Cara's inferno and comes out the other side, and lives to fight another day, undoing the damage that new traditionalists like Bruno had unleased on the world. Rock music is no longer at the center of youth culture.To rock, is to be a revolutionary.",9,2,4,26 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Requiem for Sharon
","The killing is brutal and hard to watch, but justified; it's the 'Death Wish' exemption, they had it coming to them. In 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', the historical revisionist is at it again, rewriting Joan Didion's assertion that 'the sixties ended abruptly on that August night in 1969,' the day when Tex Watson, Susan 'Sadie' Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel, disciples of Charles Manson, broke into the Roman Polanski estate on Cicelo Drive, and left California screaming in its wake. Tarantino gives the 1960s a four-month stay, passing on the dishonor to Altamont, the troubled music festival headlined by The Rolling Stones as being the official funeral for peace and love, the anti-Woodstock experience. That's because the killers go to the wrong house. Sharon Tate, along with Abigail Folger and Jay Sebring, survive the close encounter. Since 'The Family' members die in such grisly fashion, a curious thing happens. The filmmaker puts the onus on the cult leader, not its followers, in this phantasmagorical world. Sean Durkin's 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' shows how a charismatic man can transform innocent children into cold-blooded killers. With their Ford Galaxie parked roadside, the male driver and his female passenger-side companion start to banter about popular culture, reminds us of their relative youth. This peculiar relatability that the filmmaker instills in the audience still lingers, when the docudrama-like narrative goes wayward. Tarantino, in a sense, rewrites the film with a 'Minority Report'-like, or maybe, even Orwellian sensibility. He knows the historical record. He knows the killers' collective 'thoughtcrime'. Cliff Booth) a WWII veteran-turned-stuntman, not only dispatches the would-be murderers in Grand Guignol fashion, but he also murders the idealism of flower children, along with the nihilism of flower children in lambs clothing, both, who were both anti-establishment. To a man like Cliff, the infantrymen in the war, contemporaneous to the film, are their stuntmen. Lest not the audience forget, Brad Pitt played Lt. Aldo Raine in the WWII period piece 'Inglorious Basterds'.Cliff's boss, television actor Rick Dalton(Leonardo DiCaprio), a studio system dinosaur roaming aimlessly in 'New Hollywood', never did any military service, but he pays Cliff, which makes the stuntman a sort of mercenary soldier, like 'The Dirty Dozen' encapsulated into a single man. At Spahn Ranch, the studio lot where they shot 'Bounty Law', the television western that Rick a measure of fame, has turned into a ghost town, overrun by a new sheriff in town, Charles Manson(Damon Herriman) and a group of drug-addled desperados, 'The Family', playing cowboy. After Cliff Booth, a classic antihero(the stunt man may have killed his wife) checks up on the ranch owner, he returns to find a shirtless hippie, and an intentionally-flattened tire. The stunt man nearly beats the vandal to death. Cliff, a WII veteran, and his employer are old school; they don't think much of their replacements. These unwashed people belong on motorcycles, not horses. Upon Cliff's arrival, Cliff, a stranger to these parts, cues Tex Watson(Austin Butler), a 'homesteader', who comes charging bareback through the wild west movie set, bringing the cowtown façade to life. This is not your father's rodeo, though. The filmmaker, a student of genre, evokes the acid western, which were journeys toward death in a nightmare society, best exemplified by Monte Hellman's 'The Shooting' and 'Ride the Wild Wind'. It's no 'Wanted: Dead or Alive'(the inspiration behind 'Bounty Law'), this performative simulacrum, like something out of a theme park exhibition. The coexistence of the stunt man and Manson Family acolytes is representative of genre and subgenre, respectively; a contemporaneous dissonance in which Cliff attempts to reverse the alchemy of westerns, or rather, remythologize the myth inherent in John Ford films, by rescuing George Spahn(Bruce Dern), the owner of the ranch, from these bohemian cowboys. Cliff, however, is eight years too late. He is like Natalie Wood, playing Debbie, in 'The Searchers'; Debbie never asked to be rescued from her new family, the Comanche tribe who kidnapped her. Ethan Edwards(John Wayne) didn't search fast enough either. George used to be an anachronism, just like the 1966 Cadillac de Ville parked in the middle of this fictive one-horse town. But now he is one of them, an unwitting accomplice to the potentiality for helter skelter, and on a filmic level, a man who remakes himself as a survival tactic, professionally(and literally). It's not his fault that he became a turncoat. The occupation of Spahn Ranch can be traced back to a bad career decision made by Rick Dalton. Without realizing it, Rick contributed to the sea change. 'Bounty Law' was a hit with the American viewing public, but the show's star thought he could transition into film, since his name, at the outset, was attached to an early version of John Sturges' 'The Great Escape', in which he was slated to play Captain Virgil Hills, a rebellious British commonwealth soldier who orchestrates the breakout of a POW camp. The studio passed on Rick, picking Steve McQueen(Damian Lewis) instead, which catapulted 'The King of Cool' pass his small-screen contemporary and into the Hollywood constellation of stars. This deep animosity Rick feels toward hippies is an insincere prejudice, because had he secured the part, it would be him and not McQueen, hobnobbing with Michelle Phillips(Rebecca Rittenhouse) and her ilk at the Playboy mansion hobnobbing with other counterculture types.The blowtorch cools down. The LAPD officers fish the charred remains of Sadie Atkins(Mikey Madison) from the swimming pool. Tex Watson and Patricia Krenwinkel(Madison Beaty) didn't survive the pit bull bites. Brandie, Cliff's dog, craves cheap wet dog food topped with kibble, and blood. The stunt man is taken away by ambulance, leaving Rick alone, standing alone in his carport, where just minutes ago, he told the hunting party to get lost. And then Jay Sebring(Emile Hirsch), a body in the crime scene photo, like a resurrection, appears at Polanski's gate and asks his neighbor about the hubbub. Lazarus' sister, Sharon Tate(Margot Robbie), the focal point of Quentin Tarantino's requiem for The Manson Family victims, invite the journeyman actor to her Benedict Canyon estate via telecom. Rick knows that she is the gatekeeper, the woman who can introduce him to Roman Polanski(Rafal Zariwuecha) and other A-list talent. Tate will soon realize, through broadcast news and newspapers, the association between the dead youth and Charles Manson, and that Rick's intervention saved her life. She is going to recognize Manson as that stranger who knocked on her door, asking for Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson, the previous tenant. Tate, as a promising up-and-comer, who became something of a household name after playing a French 'art film' actress in Mark Robson's 'Valley of the Dolls', she has the power to rehabilitate a career in decline. But it's her beau, Roman Polanski, fresh off the commercial and critical success of 'Rosemary's Baby', whom Rick gets all starry-eyed over. He underestimates Sharon. The proverbial guest star-level showbiz industry hack doesn't mention, or perhaps, even register the ethereal blonde as a presence riding shotgun, when he and his unofficial chauffeur first spot the famous couple, stopping at the remote-controlled gate in their fancy European sports car. Especially now, fresh off his success as the lead in a string of 'spaghetti westerns'. Rick sees Sharon as little more than Polanski's muse; his inferior, with a complete unawareness of their diverging positions on the Hollywood food chain. Rick Dalton echoes the hubris that infects a washed-up comedian in Charlie Chaplin's 'Limelight'. Calvero(Charlie Chaplin), too, in the 1952 film, saves a life, Thereza Embrose(Claire Bloom), a ballerina par excellence, which he mistakenly presumes to be a streetwalker. After watching Thereza audition for his old theater company, Calvero sits with the lights out, a darkness that internalizes a deep shame born from his indescribable faux pas, imagining the dancer as a potential partner in vaudeville, a lowbrow art, during the dream sequence. The ballerina gets the clown a job.There is no transcendent Sharon Tate performance we can point to. Her death was unfair. What Tarantino does is recast Tate in people's minds as an actress with a flair for comedy. He pares down her short career to a single scene from Phil Karlson's largely-forgotten 'The Wrecking Crew', in which she holds her own, doing slapstick, opposite Dean Martin. She plays against type; a klutz. Margot Robbie has few lines; it's a silent movie within a movie, a nod, perhaps, to Berenice Bejo's performance as a late-twenties era movie actress in Michel Hazanavicius' 'The Artist'. Peppy Miller makes the transition into sound pictures. Her pull revives the career of George Valentin(Jean Dujardin), a silent film star, who doesn't survive the talkies, just like how Rick Dalton's career floundered when the studio system dissolved. George never attains the same level of notoriety and fame, but at least he's relevant again, thanks to his generous insider patron. Polanski, who would direct 'What?', a 1972 Italian production, starring Marcelo Mastroianni, seems perfect for Rick, since he is already a known entity in the Italian film industry. But this is about Sharon. Did she have the potential to be a true artist. Quentin Tarantino seems to think so.That's good enough for me.",10,26,41,22 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," May the Faro be with you
","The Baltic Sea, should you find yourself there, and you're the romantic type, searching for a philosopher by rowboat, you know about the two islands off the southeastern coast of Sweden. You're looking for Faro, the smaller rock, further north from Gotland, where filmmaker Ingmar Bergman called home, away from well-meaning but bothersome cineastes who had so many questions about the creative force inside him, until he passed away in 2007 at the the age of 89. Filmmaker Rian Johnson outs Ingmar as a secret Skywalker, Luke's spiritual brother. In 'The Last Jedi', Episode VII in the 'Star Wars' saga, Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a Jedi who lost that fightin' feeling, can't understand how this unannounced visitor, Rey(Daisy Ridley), a mere girl, was able to locate the tiny island on the most obscure planet in the galaxy. Towards the end of J.J. Abrams' 'The Force Awakens', BB8, an astromech droid, supplies the last piece that completes the map detailing Master Luke's supposed whereabouts, which R2D2 kept stored in low-power mode. The two hermits, one, a fictional character, a Jedi Knight, who turned his back on 'The Force', a religion that, according to its last living practitioner, does as much bad as it does good; and the other, a legendary filmmaker of Swedish origin, who directed, for starters, 'Winter Light', the 1963 film about a pastor losing his religion and his parishioner to suicide, is linked together by Max von Sydow. Sydow plays both Jonas Persson, the morose and fatalistic Lutheran, and Lor San Tekka, a retired adventurer but active Resistance collaborator from Jakku, the same desert planet where Rey, an orphaned junk collector, hails from. The presence of the medieval knight from Bergman's masterpiece 'The Seventh Seal' makes plausible the theory that Faro serves as the inspiration for the floating rock where Luke Skywalker inhabits. 'Bergman's Island', Faro's unofficial moniker, had loyal residents who protected their famous neighbor from reporters and tourists, which became increasingly harder after the advent of Google Maps during Bergman's final years, but like Rey, not coincidentally, the film world sent its own emissary, Marie Nyrerod, a girl, to coax the old master back into the spotlight. Luke, inevitably, would unretire, but in Bergman's case, 'Saraband', released in 2003, would prove to be his final film, but Nyrerod returned back to civilization with 'Bergman's Island', the last time the film universe would hear from its beloved hero, whose camera was his lightsaber.'I have a high state of disaster preparedness,' Bergman describes to Nyrerod. It's how he fights The Demon of Disaster, a demon that is pertinent to 'The Last Jedi'. It comes from a list of personal demons that Bergman wrote down on folded paper, like a found sacred text, which he brings to the interview. Bergman adds: 'This means that you imagine everything you do in a day, everything you plan from that day onwards, will go terribly wrong.' Luke Skywalker knew that awry feeling on a daily basis while teaching Ben(Adam Driver), the son of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher), the ways of the Jedi at his training temple. He forgot the religion's most basic tenet: The Force will always be; it does not die with the Jedi. What goes unsaid from the Jedi in exile is that the legend who was Luke Skywalker, mistakenly believed that he could handle the dark forces welling up in Ben Solo. 'It was too late,' Rey hears this ascetic man explain about the transformation that Snoke(Andy Serkis) played a part in engineering. Luke had no cure for 'the darkness rising in him', the future leader of the First Order. On a rainy night, while Leia's son slept, Luke confirmed for the final time what he already knew must be done, which was to kill the dark side that resided in the boy with a quick stroke from the lightsaber. Skywalker knew it would end in disaster.In the Nyrerod documentary, the longer Bergman speaks, the more he sounds like a Jedi master. Two demons: Fear and Rage, duel and cancel each other out, a perpetual draw that leaves a wizened Bergman at repose despite owning up to 'a dreadful temper' inherited from his parents, because at the same time, he also admits to being 'scared of everything' and 'afraid of several kinds of people,' himself included. In a nutshell, that is The Force. The Faro townsfolk respect Bergman's need for seclusion, just like the alien caretakers of Ahch-To, indigenous planetary creatures who coexists peacefully alongside Luke, not Master Luke, the honorific name C3PO(Anthony Daniels) gave the boy since their halcyon days on Tatooine. On this lonely island, the student becomes the teacher, like Yoda before him, 'young Skywalker' gives Rey a crash course on becoming a Jedi. Sitting atop a flat rock, the young woman-in-training senses 'powerful light, powerful darkness,' the same sort of balance that Bergman touches on; fear and rage, the two-headed demon all Jedi Knights try to nullify, but some, inevitably, lose, in a moment of weakness, hubris, and the craven thirst for power, which polarizes such equanimity. With Luke's encouragement, Rey meditates; her mind's eye explores the Jedi religion through a geographical survey of the island, exploring its themes of good and evil in its topography, with the latter being represented by a round cave opening near the ocean. 'You went straight to the dark!' Luke, in anguish, cries out, reminding him anew as to why the Jedi order must end. The dark side is seductive and omnipotent, a negative energy source that eats away at the soul, which no novitiate should have to deal with alone. Rey answers: 'But I didn't see you. Nothing from you,' and like Jonas Persson(Max von Sydow) in 'Winter Light', she had no choice but to face the prospect of dying without the sanctification that a Jedi Knight or a pastor offers as a provision against evil.It shows, the disappearance of Pastor Tomas Ericsson's faith. People can tell. That's why they stay away in droves. His sermons are delivered like rote memorizations in a saturnine voice that communicates the agony of existence, not hope. Only a desperate lot takes solace in a black Eucharist, among them Karin Persson(Gunnel Lindblom), Jonas' wife. He asks the pastor(Gunnar Bjornstrand) to counsel her distressed husband, who fears China, a country with the A-bomb. To Jonas, it's the Death Star. Pastor Tomas shares with Luke Skywalker the same cynicism in regard to their role as conduits for their respective religions, both feeling, down deep inside, like a symptom of the disease. The retired Jedi Knight, in hindsight, can see how The Force created Darth Vader, the Sith, and now, Kylo Ren. Tomas, similarly, as a younger man during the Spanish Civil War, saw his fellow pastors side, then benefit with riches and unchecked power, after Nationalist leader Francisco Franco's blood-soaked victory over his enemies, a sort of Resistance. Tomas couldn't reconcile his faith being co-opted by a ruthless dictator. How could Franco, the pastor thought, pray to the same God as him? Not so dissimilar from Darth Vader, during his reign as Supreme Ruler, the former Anakin Skywalker, perverted The Force into a powerful tool of authoritarianism against the Rebel Alliance. Both the Jedi Master and the Lutheran pastor, however, have a responsibility towards their true believers. Jonas is left rudderless by Tomas' suggestion that he turn his back on God. Such egocentric counseling results in a self-inflicted shot to the head by a man who needed a few comforting words. Luke, on the other hand, realizes his mistake. He put Rey's life in mortal danger by sending the girl from Jakku back to fight The First Order without proper Jedi training.'Mighty Skywalker bloodline,' Luke sneers back on the island; a curse, in his decades-long reassessment, becomes a blessing, for the time being, an ideological repreival that lasts just long enough for the Jedi Knight to hold off Ren Kyro from eradicating the last remaining members of the Resistance. The pastor in 'Winter's Light' never switches his position on God's existence/silence, but Ingmar Bergman, in real life, possessed second thoughts on the post-physical world, admitting to Marie as such, that in the winter of his life, he has become convinced by what can only be described as empirical magic. Like Luke and Leia, he feels the presence of his late wife Ingrid von Rosen. therefore, the great filmmaker surmises that there must be an afterlife; a long-awaited reunion in the making.May the force be with Ingmar.",9,4,11,28 December 2019
Midsommar," Too many flowers
","Sometimes it's okay to be an ugly American. The problem with the young adults in Ari Aster's 'Midsommar' is that they're college students. The humanities get them killed. Learned men and women taught these impressionable students not to bring their own preconceived notions of civilization into cultures that reject Western, or Judeo-Christian values. Characters in horror movies are largely stupid, willfully putting themselves into harm's way. 'Midsommar' is different. They're global citizens, and acting as global citizens, the undergraduates keep an open mind about customs and atypical human behavior that they don't understand. Being too smart keeps them there. Nobody wants to be accused of being a snob. Besides, one of their friends is a cultist. Everybody loves Pelle(Vilhelm Blomgren), the gentle and soft-spoken Swede, so nobody says anything truly derogatory about his homecoming, except for Mark(Will Poulter), the sardonic American, who quips: 'So we're stopping in Waco before going to Pelle's village?''Midsommar' can be read as a satire on ethnographic films, such as David and Laura Glen Shapiro's 'Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale', a documentary about anthropologist Tobias Scheenbaum who not only studied the cannibalistic diet of Peruvian aboriginals, the Arkmbut tribe, he became a cannibal himself. For sure, the group composition doesn't lend itself to self-preservation. Dani(Florence Pugh) just lost her immediate family in a murder/suicide. Josh(William Jackson Harper) and Christian(Jack Reynor), Dani's boyfriend, are anthropology majors. Mark, however, differs from the rest, because he feels superior to these pagan cultists. Without permission, Mark vapes, as if he owns the place, never once taking into account that smoking of any sort could be against their laws. 'Those girls are walking funny,' Mark observes, when the female villagers gather wildflowers in a backwards motion. Unfortunately, he takes a nap at the wrong time. If Mark was present for the attestupa, ritualized suicide in which village elders step off a steep cliff, maybe, just maybe, he could have caused a louder commotion, joining Simon(Archie Madekwe) and Connie(Ellora Torchia) in a chorus of American privilege, by calling a spade a spade: This is b****** crazy. And with a running start, lead his friends through the Scandinavian woods.Babette Hersant(Stephanie Audrane) had no place to go. Her husband and son were among the French civil war fatalities, collateral damage in a counter-revolutionary insurrection against the Paris Commune, a radical Socialist movement that governed France for a short period in 1871. The Marxists were overthrown during what became known as La semaine sanglante(a.k.a. 'The Bloody Week'), when the regular army brought France back to normal order. Babette, suddenly, caught on the wrong side of history, escaped to Jutland, living alongside provincials who believed that 'earthly love and marriages were considered of scant worth and merely empty illusion'. Circumstances being what they were, this doctrine suited Babette just fine. Two women, Phillipa(Bodji Kjer), a budding opera singer in her youth, and Martine(Birgitte Feerspiel), the sister that doesn't sing, who could have been the wife of a high-ranking general, employs Babette as their live-in maid. Their father, an orthodox Papist minister(Pouel Kern), simply known as 'Papa', in 'Babette's Feast', a film by Gabriel Axel, invented a religion seemingly designed to prevent his daughters from leaving the commune. Being that his congregants are cut off from the larger part of Denmark, a demagogue like the pastor can invent bylaws that are atypical from societal and religious norms. The women are celibate, in essence, nuns, but instead of being married to God, both daughters seem engaged to their father, perpetually saving themselves for a wedding night that never arrives. Visitors come and visitors go, recognizing the place for what is; a cult, one man's own private Pietistic conventicle. Lorens(Jarl Kulie), as a young man, can't get anywhere with Martine because romantic love is against her religion. The disservice done to Phillipa by this Protestant sect is even worse. Under the tutelage of Achille Papin(Jean-Phillipe Lafont), a famed Parisan opera singer, Phillipa was destined to become a famous diva, before she suddenly puts a kibosh to the idea of fame and fortune, and perhaps, love, when she chooses this cult of personality over Papin, her safe passage to the real world. It's a human horror neither man wants any part of. Arguably, they don't fight hard enough for the women they love.As May Queen, a title Dani wins in a dance competition that rewards endurance, she holds the power of life over death. Dani gets to choose the ninth human sacrifice for a purging ceremony that entails being burned alive. When her victory was still in doubt, this orphan, wanting to share with somebody her excitement, looks toward the sideline for Christian, who refuses to make eye contact with her. 'Does he feel like home to you?' Pelle had asked her. No, he doesn't. In that instant, she makes a snap decision: Harga, a commune in rural Sweden, seemingly a million miles away from America, becomes her new living space. She pardons Torbjorn(Mihaly Kaszas), the pagan, the 'lucky' lottery winner', and selects her boyfriend for temple duty. During the ritual, Christian wears the skin of a bear that had recently been specially disemboweled for the occasion. Ironically enough, back at her dormitory room, Dani had kept a painting that showed a little girl peering into the face of a giant brown bear. The painting can be interpreted this way: The girl, of course, is Dani; she looks to the bear, symbolizing formalized religion, for help in getting over the loss of her older sister and parents, but is let down, just like how Christian, her boyfriend, lets her down, by participating in a fertility ceremony. Similar to Babette, the former head chef at the famed Cafe Anglais, in 'Babette's Feast', Dani turns her back against the world because everybody she loves is dead.Babette was once a sensual and vibrant woman, a Parisian, who lived the high life among artists and revolutionaries. With her lottery money, she orchestrates a grand feast for these Jutland provincials as a way of revisiting this past persona, one final time, when the world was her oyster. Babette is content to live out her days as a Puritan. Her employers' father, the minister, as it turns out, was right; 'happiness' was an illusion.The final shot in 'Midsommar' is a close-up of Dani, smiling.She is born-again.A pagan.",8,1,5,6 November 2019
Joker," Foster child
","Joker shoots a man on live television. Somebody alert Batman! Flash the bat signal! The Caped Crusader will take care of this joker and save us all. But alas, this is not your father's 'Batman', the 1989 Tim Burton film starring Michael Keaton as the titular character. Bruce Wayne(Dante Pereira-Olson) is just a small boy, privileged but lonely, and neglected. 'The only one who can save us,' according to Joker's mother is Thomas Wayne(Brett Cullen), a billionaire philanthropist running for mayor of Gotham; a politician. For now, the rule of law will be tested, and in the near-future, until young Bruce Wayne grows up. In 1981, television was king. Joker inspires a copycat, an activist from the 'Clown Movement', a militant group that targets the rich. An unknown assailant hidden behind a clown mask guns down Bruce Wayne's parents in an alley, as lore goes, but this isn't Batman's origin story; it's the Joker's. Why stop there? The film treats this double murder as justice for the poor and downtrodden. Thomas Wayne had it coming. The audience roots for the villain. Bruce Wayne, the audience realizes with a start, is part of the 1%. The film portrays his father as a man with no empathy for the working class; a real thug. So if Joker fights for the little guy, who will Bruce Wayne defend when he grows up to occupy the bat suit? Will Bruce Wayne still be Batman, or have some other moniker, such as Cape Fear?Rupert Pupkin is on the move. Played by Robert DeNiro, the audience wonders if Jerry Langford(Jerry Lewis), a late-night talk show host, stands to be in any immediate danger. Besieged by autograph hounds and groupies, Jerry pays the price of fame every night after taping. The body density outside the studio, an obstacle he hazards with as much graciousness he can muster up, taxes him. To get from the backstage door to the sanctuary of his limousine is a traversal of incremental steps. DeNiro's reputation as a vigilante precedes him. He was Travis Bickle, after all, in Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver', a cab driver, who in a similar crowd situation, converges on the presidential hopeful Senator Charles Palantine(Leonard Harris) in motion with bad intentions. Pupkin, an aspiring comedian, however, is a different sort of sociopath. 'The King of Comedy' doesn't want to kill Jerry Langford; he wants to be him. A quick study, Rupert, a fan(atic), diagnoses the mechanics of this pandemonium him and improvises, riffing as Jerry's bodyguard, then switches back to his normal self, once in the car with his captive audience of one. Feeling charitable, Jerry lets him stay, a decision he'll come to regret. The veteran funnyman has no choice but to hear Rupert pitch him as a potential guest on 'The Jerry Langford Show'. Jerry stops him right there, explaining to Rupert that 'you don't walk onto a network show without experience'. Paying your dues, starting from the bottom, honing your craft; those are things Rupert can't be bothered with. A precursor to the galaxy of YouTube quasi-stars, this delusional wanna-be wants instant fame, and when Cathy Long(Shelley Hack), Jerry's administrative assistant, tells Rupert, in so many words, that he isn't funny, the self-proclaimed monarch kidnaps his hero. With the help of Masha(Sandra Bernhard), a fellow autograph hound, who ironically, has real talent(as a torch singer), he straps Jerry to a chair with masking tape in her ritzy townhouse. Rupert packs heat, sure, for the on-street abduction, but the gun; it's a toy gun. He wants to kill Jerry Langford and his studio audience...with ruckus laughter.'Joker', directed by Todd Phillips, weaponizes 'The King of Comedy', because this time, the gun is real and the gun goes off. Since the filmmaker borrows so liberally from Martin Scorsese, 'Joker' comes across as an unofficial remake. Robert DeNiro, in effect, pulls a Patty Duke, playing both student and teacher, like Duke in the 1962 and 1979 versions of 'The Miracle Worker', most notably, as Helen Keller in the Arthur Penn original. DeNiro returns as talk-show host Murray Franklin, a thinly-veiled version of Johnny Carson, which makes him the de facto 'King of Comedy'. Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), the Pupkin stand-in, has a day job working as a party clown. Stand-up comedy runs through his blood, too, but he outworks Rupert by starting from the bottom, which means open mic nights at seedy comedy clubs. Arthur listens to Jerry Langford, a communique between films, while at the same time, Rupert Pupkin would have better luck persuading Murray Franklin, who has no qualms about putting a rank amateur on national television. Both men, Rupert and Arthur live with their mothers, but we see Penny Fleck(Frances Conroy), whereas Rupert's mom is just a disembodied voice, who the audience hears telling her son repeatedly to keep the noise down. Does she even exist? 'The King of Comedy' is set in an era when seeking psychiatric help for mental problems was a few years away from being a social norm. During Rupert's monologue on 'The Jerry Langford Show', a deal that 'The King' arbitrates with network brass in exchange for their employee's life, one gag is built around the premise of a surprise visit from his mother, who has been dead for nine years. Rupert needs meds; he's schizophrenic. The protagonist is fallible, in regard to what we hear over the soundtrack. His network television debut is real, no doubt about that, but we can't trust the sounds coming from the live studio audience. They could be booing. Rupert hears what he wants to hear; his dead mother, laughter. Arthur, on the other hand, is on meds, seven different kinds, and has regular appointments with a social worker. When the clinic closes down, due to cuts in Gotham's budget, Arthur goes off the meds, all seven, he suffocates Penny Fleck with a pillow in her hospital bed. But that's beside the point. Both films, set around the same time, down to the very year, actually, feature mentally-ill protagonists; one diagnosed, and the other undiagnosed, because the former, is actually living in 'Modern Times' and doesn't feel the stigmatization of seeking medical treatment for his troubled mind. 'Joker' is not really a period-piece. And Gotham couldn't be anywhere but NYC. Charlie Chaplin played Adolph Hitler in 'The Great Dictator', but the filmmaker chose to be more subtle, going with Chaplin's 1936 film being exhibited at a movie palace with Thomas Wayne in attendance. The subtext of 'Joker' isn't limited to the diegesis. Allusions to extra-diegetical matters turn the film itself into a bat signal.The real-world pop culture references begin with Charlie Chaplin's 'Modern Times'. It has the effect of reorientating the audience back from the comic book world. 'Joker' starts off in Gotham, since Murray Franklin and his guests, including Sandra Winger(in actuality, Debra Winger, who would be promoting 'Cannery Row', given the timeline) and Skip Byron, an amalgamated moniker(Skip Stephenson and Byron Scott, two cohosts from the newsmagazine show 'Real People'), are, quite pointedly, not real people. But Charlie Chaplin is. He plays his trademark character 'The Little Tramp', a hobo; and the elite, the 1% who congregate at the fancy bijou for a benefit screening of 'Modern Times', are laughing at, in essence, the economic obstacles that face the poor day-in and day-out. The 21st century and its correlating non-fictive metropolis introduce themselves after patiently waiting in the wings to tear apart the Brechtian distanciation of the mis-en-scene to pulp shreds.The future is now. A Johnny Carson-type would never humiliate some mental defective. The soundstage is a time machine. The gunshot blast activates it. Murray Franklin reclines in his throne with a forehead blemish; a bullet hole. Gotham is New York City. Cut to the Wayne family emerging from the movie theater. On the marquee, two real films: Peter Medak's 'Zorro, The Gay Blade' and Brian DePalma's 'Blow Out' are playing. Bruce is under 18, so presumably, his parents took him to see 'Zorro'. Just a few minutes later, Bruce Wayne suddenly finds himself parentless; a potential foster child if not for Alfred Pennyworth(Douglas Hodge), the Wayne's manservant. It's no coincidence that 'Joker' is set in 1981. Martin Scorsese had no idea that 'Taxi Driver' would inspire a Travis Bickle copycat who wanted to save Iris(Jodie Foster), a child prostitute, from 'Sport'(Harvey Keitel), her pimp. This filmmaker, however, knows that he's taking a risk. 'Joker' works as John Hinckley's origin story. This powder keg of a movie has the very real potentiality of changing two histories; the DC universe and ours. Bruce Wayne is the 1%. Who will Batman defend when he grows up?And somebody out there in America, at this very moment, using Arthur Fleck as a role model, a Che for our times, is starting his own revolution.",1,3,10,19 February 2020
It Chapter Two," Limbo it
","Pennywise the Clown calls himself 'The Eater of Worlds'. The same can be said about writer/director whose 'The Big Chill' is a near-remake of 'The Return of the Secaucus Seven', the debut feature film by John Sayles, made four years earlier. The filmmaker, to this day, sticks by his claim that he had no prior knowledge of Sayles' micro-budgeted indie, despite both films having carbon copy premises. Seven thirty-something adults who formed a clique during their hippie years at college, reunite at a summer house and gripe about the agony of being yuppie sellouts. The only difference is that in 'The Big Chill', the ex-countercultural warriors return under somber circumstances, a memorial service for their friend Alex Marshall(Kevin Costner), the diehard who accepted too late that the dream was over. Since Costner didn't survive the final cut, the body in the coffin can be anyone or anything you want it to be; the body, for cineastes, is a filmic body, 'The Return of the Secaucus Seven', a celluloidal twin that few people knew about. After Harold Cooper(Kevin Kline) delivers the eulogy, Karen Bowen(JoBeth Williams) takes her place at the organ and plays Alex's favorite song, The Rolling Stones' 'You Can't Always Get What You Want'. For the dead, it's happiness. For the writer/director John Sayles, it's credit. At the gravesite, Nick(William Hurt) has to wrangle Meg(Mary Kay Place), who walks in the opposite direction of the ceremonial plot, but she gets there, and says goodbye to the deceased before they lower the coffin. On an extra-diegetical level, it looks as if Alex's friends are hiding the body; a secret pact made by these Secaucus Seven dopplegangers. The camera pulls back from the burial site. 'The Big Chill' is fleeing from the scene of the crime. It's a pet cemetery of sorts. 'IT: Volume Two' brings 'The Return of the Secaucus Seven' back to life. Call it creative license; call it whatever you like, but something went down in 1983 and 'The Big Chill' is the only suspect.Echoes of 'The Big Chill abound in 'IT', Stephen King's magnum opus, released three years after ******'s requiem for the baby boomer generation. There are fortune cookies in 'The Big Chill'. The fortune cookies inform 'IT: Chapter Two'. Over brunch, Karen regales her college pals with her recent Hawaiian adventure. At a local Chinese restaurant, girlfriends in tow, she encountered this very disturbing fortune: 'You'll never amount to anything.' Sarah Cooper(Glenn Close), Harold's wife, responds: 'I don't believe it.' The operative word is 'it'. The menace followed Karen back to South Carolina. 'The Big Chill' works as a human horror film; it's the idealism of their activist-oriented youth coming back to haunt them. Michael(Jeff Goldblum) reads his fortune: 'Friendship is the bread of life, but money is the honey.' Again, it's Sarah who replies. 'Even fortune cookies are getting cynical,' she says. Cynical like them, their older selves; capitalists all, with mortgages, fancy cars, and stock options. The fortune cookie is the elephant in the room. Alex's foolish idealism is what killed him. Neither Michael, who wrote an article in their college newspaper about the physics whiz turning down the Rutledge fellowship, nor Sarah, who knew him in the biblical sense, comment on Alex's epiphany, a belated dawning attributable to his suicide, that the fortune cookie message accurately prophesized. The fortune cookies in Andy Muschietti's 'IT: Chapter Two' are blunter. The Derry kids, all grown up, catch up on old times at Jade of the Orient, a Chinese restaurant, after Mike Hanlon(Isiah Mustafa) calls them back home when the cyclical nature of their haunted town's child murders rejuvenates itself, right on schedule. Instead of a fortune, The Loser Club members receive single words that they recombine in vain to form a coherent sentence. The missing link, a proper noun, that Beverly Marsh(Jessica Chastain) grips between her fingers, is added to the group fray over meaning. Beverly organizes the jumble of words: 'Guess Stanley could not cut it.' Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard) ensures that the elephant in the room is accounted for. Stanley Uris(Andy Bean), just like Alex, slit his wrists in a bathtub. The fortune cookies act as a conduit between both films. One cookie contains a bat wing. Are there bats in 'The Big Chill'? Yes. The group hears Chloe scream and rush up the stairs to her room. One cookie contains an eyeball attached to octopi-like tentacles. Does the human organ and mollusk in concert also make an appearance in 'The Big Chill'? Yes. Nick watches, on television, a black and white movie in which men ward off a giant octopus from boarding their destroyer with blowtorches. The scene comes from Robert Gordon's 'IT Came from Beneath the Sea'. Muschietti riffs, with or without the source material as a guide. Every generation, Pennywise returns to Derry. In the 1983 film, Harold, the shoe company impresario, and Sam Weber(Tom Berenger), a Tom Selleck-like television actor, make the bed, and as they straighten out the sheets, we learn that Sarah's husband plans to open up his 'twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth' store. Twenty-seven is the magic number; twenty-seven years is how long it takes for the clown to awaken from his hibernation.As the popular wisdom went, 'IT' was unadaptable for the big screen, due to the graphic violence that Pennywise committed against minors. With the rare exception, such as John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13(1976), in which a little girl gets shot in the chest near an ice cream truck, the onscreen annihilation of a child was rare. The body count in the Stephen King novel proved to be a major stumbling block. Original programming on HBO and other cable outlets, not to mention, online streaming services, were options unavailable to the group who bought from King the film rights, so 'IT' was brought to network television and condensed into an abridged two-part miniseries, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace. The iconic scene, in which a yellow slickered boy negotiates and loses not just the paper boat, but his life, looks downright Disneyesque when measured against the no-holds barred standards of violence in contemporary moviemaking. It's a bloodless scene. Pennywise(Tim Curry) grabs Georgie's arm and bares his sharp teeth, and then a dissolve to an eagle-eye shot of the boy's flower-laden casket. The blood is dislocated to a black and white picture of Georgie in Bill's photo album, drenched with oozing red body fluid. Georgie's blood, in 'IT', remains pooled on a rain-soaked street. This time, when Pennywise grabs the boy, there is no dissolve. The audience is confronted with, albeit fantasy, the intimacy of a frenzied child in jeopardy, rendered in a graphic honesty that was once deemed unthinkable. The clown has Georgie's arm firmly clamped in its jaws. There is a cut. We're spared the cleaving of his arm. But the surgery is implied, when we see the boy crawling away from the storm drain with a missing limb, before being dragged back by an alien-like elongated arm. Pennywise, in 'IT: Chapter Two', bites the face of a sad friendless little girl under the bleachers, and then, at a carnival, he breaks through a fun house mirror and eviscerates a boy in front of Bill Denbrough(James McAvoy), who is shielded from the carnage by arterial spray that coats the glass in red entire. Is this necessary? Isn't suggestive violence enough? Ugliness is in the eye of the beholder.Pennywise is anything and anyone; he can shapeshift into both monsters and people. Georgie Denbrough(Jackson Robert Scott) is the clown's favorite bit of mimicry, because it tortures Bill, who is coerced into a guilt-ridden admission of health on that fateful rainy day. As Beverly Marsh(Sophia Lillis), in a flashback, Pennywise adopts the girl's feminine wiles and fools Ben Hanscom(Jeremy Ray Taylor) into leaning in for a kiss. The clown can also transcend time and space; it has the ability to subsume the two-dimensional body of Bill's mother in a film slide, and when the projector's rapid-fire motion turn the slides into a home movie, the clown goes 3D and vacates the filmic world. It goes after Beverly. It can be anywhere and do anything, such as take celluloidal form. Beverly lives close to a glen. The clown, hypothetically, could be Glenn Close, whose Sarah Cooper can be, at times, mercurical. This is when. The old woman(Joan Gregson) who lives in the Marsh's old apartment, stops moving, freezes, as if her batteries suddenly ran out, while having a cup of tea with Beverly, before resuming her rote niceties. In 'The Big Chill', Sarah stands motionless in front of an open refrigerator; she chooses nothing, as if she forgot what it takes to be human. During Alex's wake, at the buffet table, she tells Michael: 'We give first preference to people who kill themselves in one of our bathrooms.' That's a mean thing to say; that's Pennywise.In the made-for-television version of 'IT', Ben(John Ritter) says: 'Limbo, how low can you go?' as he ducks under an aluminum rolling door. 'Limbo' was a 1999 film directed by John Sayles. Georgie could have caught up with his boat if he did the limbo instead of hitting his forehead on a road closure sign.'The Return of the Secaucus Seven' fought its way out of the pinebox and dirt.And returned as a construction batter.",7,1,2,20 September 2019
Parasite," Rear bushes
","The window looks like a movie screen. At the outset, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho immediately evokes Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', the 1954 mystery thriller about the man in a wheelchair who diagnoses a neighbor's murder plot against his wife from across the courtyard of an urban apartment complex. On a subtextual level, photographer L.B. Jeffries(James Stewart) is a voyeur; he glimpses scenes from ordinary people's lives that were never meant for his eyes. Film theorist Laura Mulvey, in her essay 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema', linked with moviegoing with voyeurism. We like to watch, more or less, is what Mulvey surmised. When Lars Thorwald(Raymond Burr), the surveilled man, does nothing integral to the cover-up of his wife's murder, Jeffries naps with his body faced away from the mini-dramas unfolding in each apartment square. Ki-woo(Choi Woo-shik), in 'Parasite', the 2019 winner of the Palm d'or at Cannes, would rather squint at a tiny screen, as demonstrated by the camerawork, a downwards tilt, in which we see the young man staring into his phone instead at the world outside from the sofa of his family's semi-basement apartment. Just like everybody else, Kim Ki-Woo would rather watch a movie on a five-inch screen, instead of the communal experience you get from traditional movie exhibition. But Bong, for the sake of contrast, replicates Hitchcock, with four voyeurs, not just one, watching a man urinate in their alleyway, a nod, perhaps, to Italian neorealism. Later, the same man returns to relieve himself, but this time, Ki-woo's college friend, Min-hyuk(Park Seo-joon), defends their garbage area with thrown bottled water. Both projections of liquid, the water and retaliatory pee, are subjected to slo-mo, transforming narrative into spectacle.Ki-woo is unemployed. So are his parents and older sister. To pay the rent, they fold pizza boxes; they copy the woman on the pizzeria's website. This repetitious task may look mundane, proletarian and unsexy, but there are people with fetishes, and these fetishists with a predilection for androgynous-looking women who convert cardboard into boxes are voyeurs, too. The Kims don't use Microsoft cell phones, but if they did, the Lumia would run Windows, an apt description of what Jeffries sees from his vantage point; open windows, which run in diametrical opposition to his rear window. Mulvery recognized that the photographer with a leg cast was a peeping tom. Jeffries ogles a woman he identifies as 'Miss Torso'(Georgine Darcy), who does calisthenics in what looks like a proto-sports bar. The moviegoer identifies with Jeffries; the moviegoer also likes to look at women in various states of undress in the dark. The 'male gaze', as she coined it, because of wireless streaming, no longer, in filmic circumstances, is no longer confined to a theater seat; the female image went mobile and saw light. The woman who is good at making pizza boxes has no control over her own image.Min-hyuk tutors the girl of a very rich family. Ki-woo's old high school buddy needs a replacement, somebody he can trust, while the English-speaking student attends college abroad, in America. To get the plum job, Ki-woo can't show that he's overawed by his luxurious surroundings. At the Park family's domain, he has to be Ki-woo in italics, an actor; a cool customer. Yeon-gyo(Cho Yeo-jeong), the girl's mother, insists on observing Ki-woo conduct her daughter's first, and potentially, last college preparatory session. When Da-hye(Jung Ji-so) errs on a practice test question, the tutor grabs this rich girl's wrist with two stern fingers, and reprimands her for lacking confidence, which, in effect, levels the playing field for Ki-woo by being the man made out chutzpah, not money. Ki-jeong(Park So-dam), Ki-woo's sister, hired as an art therapy teacher for Da-song(Jung Hyun-joo), the Parks' young son, is even bolder; she banishes the micro-managing mother from the room. Yeon-gyo would never guess that this pair of young adults live in the ghetto. If she knew how disparate the socioeconomic gap between both families were, both Ki-woo and Ki-jeong would probably be fired on the spot. Along with the meditation on voyeurism, 'Parasite' shares with 'Rear Window' the depiction of class-consciousness. Although Lisa Fremont(Grace Kelly), a Manhattan socialite, gives L.B. Jeffries an inferiority complex, this strained relationship withstands the photographer's emasculation, because the female fashion tastemaker, a seeming first lady of haute couture, believes that 'there can't be much difference between people and the way they live'. In 'Parasite', however, it's not just class consciousness, it's class warfare, since money matters to both the Park and Kim family alike. Park Dong-ik(Lee Sun-kyun), an information technology firm CEO, talks repeatedly about lines that the 'help' can't cross. The chauffeur, Ki-taek(Song Kang-ho), Ki-woo's father, overhears Dong-ik telling his wife that he smells; an odor which could be more metaphoric than literal. In 'Parasite', all the compromises to fit in are made by the Kims, whereas in 'Rear Window', it's Lisa who has to change, slumming she does, as exemplified by being interested in the book 'Beyond the High Himalayas', for the sake of the fragile male ego. She has to remake herself in L.B. Jeffries image of an ideal woman. That's not how the world works anymore. All the splendor in this rich family's house turns the Kims into parasites.The window at the Park residence looks like a movie screen, too; and this window is in the backyard, a rear window. Nothing but green grass, a perfect lawn with tastefully chosen plants and flowers at its borders. But then, after the Park family comes home from a camping trip ruined by rain, Da-song pitches an Indian tent, transforming the performative soundstage into a western. Now there is a genre film waiting to happen, a western, just like how 'Rear Window' turns into film noir, when he realizes the machinations of Lars Thorwald. The point-of-view shots in the Hitchcock film all come from Jeffries' perspective; the audience never sees L.B. from Thorwald's vantage point. In other words, Hitchcock doesn't employ the shot/countershot when Thorwald understands that somebody is watching his every move. Joon-ho, on the other hand, shows the Park house interior, not as a POV shot, but as a reverse shot; an omniscient one, in which only the real audience, not a diegetic audience of one, sees the melee between the Kims and Moon-gwang(Lee Jung-eun), the former housekeeper, and Geun-sae(Park Myung-hoon), her husband, who lives in a bunker secreted away within the house. Although Moon-gwang and her imprisoned husband share the same class status as the Kim family, the ex-housekeeper, who once doted on the house's famous architect, judges not just her former employers, but the help staff, as well, for being philistines. Moon-gwang narrates a flashback scene in which we see herself and Geun-sae not just inhabiting the place like riff-raff, but experiencing the living room as aesthetes. With a great sense of nostalgia and loss in her voice, Moon-gwang describes the sunlight, when it hits the glass, the reflection then casts a lovely glow upon the entire house. It's coded talk for celluloid. A reminiscence that is starkly contrasted to the mis-en-scene, in which the aesthetes and philistines fight over incriminating digital footage on Moon-gwang's cell phone. You can watch 'Rear Window' on a cell phone.Ki-taek tells his son: 'You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. Because life cannot be planned.'Lisa goes off-script. Stella(Thelma Ritter), L.B.'s housekeeper, tries to stop her, after they discover no evidence to support foul play when they dig up the courtyard flower bed. She climbs the exterior staircase to Lars Thornwald's apartment. Lisa crosses the line, echoing Dong-ik's words, but in an extra-diegetic sense, as she transforms herself from spectator to subject; another actor in L.B. Jeffries' movie. He watches his girlfriend find proof, Ms. Thornwald's wedding ring, just before the murder suspect returns. Lisa's ad-lib results in the conviction of Lars Thornwald. Conversely, in 'Parasite', the lay of the lawn is sandwiched between a rear window and, quite pointedly, rear bushes, where Ki-taek and his boss hide, dressed as Indians for Da-song's birthday party. Unlike L.B. Jeffries, his cross-generational counterpart, Ki-taek, despite being positioned as a voyeur among voyeurs(his wife and children), never was the spectator, because the relationship between spectator and subject is a fluid one, always interchangeable, the two positions. Technology transformed the world into a movie screen. The Park family is an aggregate of Lisa, but unlike the clotheshorse, Dong-ik, the IT CEO, especially, believes that there is a difference in how people 'eat, talk, drink, laugh, and wear clothes'. In the chauffeured car, Dong-ik sits in the rear seat, a barrier, but at the birthday party, hiding behind the rear bushes, without a visible barrier, Ki-taek knows that it still exists, even though they are dressed identically as Indians.The voyeur doesn't have to sit in a darkened theater anymore. It's not 1954. The voyeur carries with him a cellphone. The Park living room, metaphorically speaking, is the theater. But nobody has to be on the sofa to watch the ensuing melee, in which Ki-taek crosses the line and stabs his employer in the heart with a large knife. Films are mobile now. The voyeurs are in the backyard, close to the murder; spectators and subjects, sometimes one, sometimes both.",9,1,6,15 November 2019
Mother!," Fortress of solitude
","The tire jack slipped. Jonathan Kent(Glenn Ford) should have been crushed by his pickup truck, but the fatal contact between man and metal never arrives. The truck is held in suspension by an inordinately strong boy who fell from the sky. Did this alien child need help loading his spacecraft into the man's truck? It's possible. The boy is strong, but short. If he loaded his spacecraft from the side by throwing it into the bed with outstretched arms pointed towards heaven, the weight of the thing could have broken the wheel axle. More than likely, Jonathan opened the door's latch and had his future adopted son ease the thing in from the back. Hopefully, they had a tarp to throw over the UFO. It's not called Smallville for nothing. People talk. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky was once slated to direct 'Man of Steel', which eventually got made with Zach Snyder at the helm. 'mother!' is not just Bunuel-built, an homage to 'The Exterminating Angel', the Spanish surrealist filmmaker's 1962 classic, but also 'Superman', the 1978 original directed by Richard Lester. Soon after his father's heart attack, young Clark Kent(Jeff East) discovers the florescent green crystal in his spaceship, hidden in the barn. His alien intuition tells him to go north, apparently by foot. Into subzero Arctic air, he flings the green glowing object as far as he needs to. The crystal disappears in the melted snow. It's a building block that transforms earth's snowy landscape into architecture that's uniquely Krypton-esque. Clark is home-schooled, so to speak; a formal education supplied by Jor-el(Marlon Brando) via prerecorded messages leap years ahead of VHS technology. When Clark, in essence, graduates from the Fortress of Solitude, his school and home, and also, a chrysalis of sorts, he emerges as Superman(Christopher Reeve).A poet, identified as Him(Javier Bardem) never wanted kids. He impregnates mother(Jennifer Lawrence), his wife, only after she emasculates the writer, asking him point blank, as to why their marriage is devoid of physical love? mother gives birth to a son; not in the hospital, but instead, the nursery she put together, because mother never leaves the house. Him, at first glance, isn't a cruel man; his wife seems free to come and go as she pleases, and yet the woman never gets past the front door, never sees what lies beyond the front lawn. Not even with a violent and bloody small-scale war in progress and formation of a cult devoted solely to the poet, mother stays with her unborn child inside the self-designated confines, telling strangers to get off her unbraced sink, and avoiding gunfire. How does 'mother!' differ from 'The Exterminating Angel'? Is she bourgeois like the dinner guests who can't get past the elegant house's salon? Yes and no. Although a bourgeois/proletariat binary exists in 'mother!', Aronofsky provides a secondary binary that is given first priority. When Him demands that mother hand over the child, his son; only then does she start to distrust the poet, and perhaps, see the truth of their relationship she tries so hard to obfuscate. His followers outside the room, he explains, just want to lay eyes on their baby boy. When mother refuses, Him drags a chair in front of his small family, and waits for her to fall asleep. mother wakes up just in time to see her stolen baby being used as a human sacrifice, a ceremony that turns out to have literary ramifications. The poet could have put a stop to the murder, but he allows it, because he needs to allow it, for his own survival. Him's devoted readers hide the evidence by eating small portions of human flesh. Surely now, her husband will send everybody home. The wife's suspicion grows, and so does the audience, in regard to who, or what Him is, when he asks mother to forgive the cannibals. This, of course, would be the Christian thing to do: 'Forgive thy enemy,' but that's a cult of personality who ate their baby, not holy roller fundamentalists. The impossible request made by her husband pushes mother over the edge. And here is where Aronofsky riffs on 'The Exterminating Angel', during that climactic scene when mother drops the lighter and sets everyone and everything on fire. Rita Ugalde(Patricia Moran), one of the dinner guests, in the Luis Bunuel film, about the proletariat, says: 'I believe the common people, the lower class people, are less sensitive to pain. Haven't you ever seen a wounded bull? Not even a trace of pain.' Why is Him the only person who survives the flames?The writer can be the proletariat, but the act of writing is bourgeois.The wife is not corporeal; she's a muse; a god, a literary god, who invents, not creates people. The first word out of mother's mouth is: 'Baby.' This baby grew up to be Him. The poet is merely a facilitator for mother's words. Him kills their baby because that child was his replacement. Him would not be able to write a single word without muses. Without mother, he would be, god forbid, a reader. mother is eternal, manifesting herself over and over again; a whole procession of mothers, who outlives her usefulness once Him finishes his latest work. Earlier in 'mother!', an old married couple known as man(Ed Harris) and woman(Michelle Pfeiffer) drop a crystal object, shattering it to smithereens, in Him's study. The poet raises his voice, the only time in the whole film. The crystal, we learn in the denouement, comes not from some distant country, but somewhere closer to home, when Him, carrying mother, burnt almost beyond recognition, reaches into his wife's chest and steals her heart away. Paring down the organ's overdone meat, burnt flesh falling wayside, the poet gets what he wants; another crystal. He places the crystal in its exalted place of honor, a wire holder, as if it was a Faberge egg that contained a miniaturized scroll of Homer's last unfinished poem. The crystal has restoration powers. The house gets rebuilt. The house is alive. mother is the house; a crib for Him, her baby all grown up; a poet who tries to save humanity with words, alone in his fortress of solitude.What kind of Superman would Darren Aronofsky have dreamt up? Nobody knows for sure, but consider this. Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), a mortal woman, strips Superman of his powers, in Richard Donner's 'Superman II', whereas in 'mother!', a muse, or rather, a superwoman, turns the poet into Him, an oracle. Maybe the mother who regenerates in the same bed where her predecessor originated from, will be smart enough to cut out the middleman and write her own story.",7,2,6,22 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," The political and the personal
","A real Nazi would step on the blue butterfly. At Hitler Youth camp, older boys teach the younger ones to be dispassionate towards killing. By the time these youngsters are done with this program of systemic brainwashing, the newly-minted soldier will have no harder time shooting a man in the head than twisting a rabbit's neck. A ten-year-old boy, that's all Jojo(Roman Griffin Davis) is, caught up in the wrong place and time on this spinning green planet, but Berlin circa 1945 happen to be his fate, making him ten in dog years. His relative innocence is barbed, however, since the boy, despite lacking the killer instinct to fatally injure small forest creatures, the little Nazi desperately wants to be a credit to the German race. He wants to be like everybody else. Because of this guilt, Adolph Hitler(Taika Waititi) repeatedly appears as his imaginary friend, rooting Jojo on to be evil. It's not a matter of Jojo objecting to party ideology; he believes that an Aryan has absolute power over the animal kingdom. His inherent goodness embarrasses him; he places the rabbit on the ground and shoos him. The Fuhrer of Jojo's own making has filmic DNA traceable to the camp counselor Bill Murray plays in Ivan Reitman's 'Meatballs'. Waititi, in fact, seems to be channeling Tripper in the next scene, when Jojo returns to his group with the same anarchic spirit, running encouragingly alongside the Rudy-like(Chris Makepeace) kid, as if throwing a live grenade was an event in the Olympiad. Jojo's shame derives, not from some moral failure of the fatherland, but rather, what he sees as his own personal failure in regard to treating the murder of lesser lives, both human and animal, as a good soldier's mandate without tears. The kid is a zealot; he has Nazimania. Jojo lives with the enemy; Rosie(Scarlett Johannsen), his own mother, the real hero of 'Jojo Rabbit'. Unbeknownst to Jojo, the mother is anti-fascist and an unequivocal Jewish sympathizer. It's a man's world, even if the boy is not yet a man. Despite being older than him, Jojo is master of the house. Rosie knows, with some certainty, that her ten-year-old son would hand Elsa(Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl she hides behind a hollowed-out wall, over to the gestapo for not being blonde with blue eyes. Jojo, unapologetically, is an anti-Semite; a jarring political position, to be sure, for a comedy. The boy plays mind games with his mother, greedily eating Rosie's two bread slices that she had planned on saving for Elsa. Jojo knows her mother's secret. It's a discreet interrogation with the goal of entrapping his mother for her role in harboring a known enemy; a treasonous act punishable by death. Because of Jojo's tender age, labeling him as the hero seems only natural, but 'Jojo Rabbit' is not that simple. Rosie loves her son, but he is a stranger in her own house. Ultimately, Jojo pays the price for buying into party-line propaganda about Germans being human civilization's master race. The butterfly leads Jojo to a pair of dangling legs. The shoes belong to his mother. 'Jojo Rabbit', directed by Taika Waititi, doesn't seem aware, just like its complicated protagonist, how Rosie ended up in a public square, swinging at the gallows. Does the filmmaker actually believe that Jojo deserves recognition as being one of the heroes, the David Bowie song's namesake that accompanies the scene in which Elsa realizes the American soldiers have liberated her?This boy is not a hero.Let's rewind.Dagger in hand, Jojo finally works up the nerve to kill, or rather, go through the motions, because cold-blooded murder is not really in his DNA, which continues to be a constant source of humiliation. For the fuhrer, the schutzstaffel, and most of all, his mother, he stabs Elsa near the shoulder. The Jewish girl stops the knife's forward momentum, but not before it breaks skin, enough to draw blood and leave a miniscule splotch on her blouse. Elsa probably knows why German authorities had stopped by unannounced to sweep the house for contraband humans, yet the illegal girl, despite being maimed, willingly plays the scapegoat, as an act of magnanimity. Impersonating Jojo's deceased sister. Elsa got the birthdate wrong on Inge's identification papers when Captain Klezendorf(Sam Rockwell) quizzes her. If not for the captain's fondness for this ten-year-old loyalist, Elsa would have been outed immediately, placed under arrest, and processed for deportation, on the next train to Auschwitz. Rosie's fate is sealed, the audience realizes, in retrospect, when Klezendorf asks Jojo if his mother 'spends much time at home'. This pint-sized Nazi, the audience needs to remember, since 'Jojo Rabbit' can, at times, be confused for Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom', that the kid is a real patriot who bought hook, line, and sinker, every fiction about the inferiority of the Jewish race as objective fact. Chillingly, Rosie never broaches the subject of his party's amorality with Jojo because she knows that mentors such as Captain Klezendorf had turned her son into an automaton, a robot, so to speak. Case and point, the boy catches his mother distributing leaflets which read: 'Free Germany!' under the guise of a robot, while out collecting scrap metal for the war effort. Replace the robot costume with a soldier's uniform, and suddenly, it's easier to gauge the ideological war at home as a trenchant one. Does Jojo know about ethnic cleansing? Most likely. The boy doesn't interject as Elsa, who wrongly equates her loss with his, explains that she, too, has been orphaned. Jojo, plain and simple, talks too much. Too many times to too many people, Jojo asks about the proper course of action should he spot a dislocated Jew; a hypothetical so thinly-veiled, even Yorki(Archie Yates), a conscripted soldier his own age, understands intuitively that somebody of non-Aryan descent lives under his roof. Did Yorki, a young ideologue like his best friend, put together: 'I have a girlfriend now,' with 'I captured a Jew,' and report this to Captain Klezendorf, corroborating what he already knew from Jojo's own unwitting testimony. There is, after all, no love lost between the captain and Rosie, who knees him in the crotch and slaps him across the cheek with a black glove, right in front of his bureaucratic subordinates, after she learns that Jojo nearly blew himself up with a grenade under Klezendorf's command. Played as comedy, the audience laughs, but the debased captain, it should be noted, would have been a soldier in the Waffen-SS if not for his handicap; a defective left eye. More likely than not, Klezendorf reported Jojo's mother to the gestapo, as revenge for his public humiliation, and lest we forget, because he's a Nazi.The titular character in Cate Shortland's 'Lore', a 2012 historical drama about the outset of postwar Germany, just like Jojo, has to unlearn everything she was taught as a Hitler Youth. Hannalore Dressler(Saskia Rosendahl), the oldest daughter of a high-ranking Nazi officer, during her long trek, accompanied by four younger siblings to Omi's house, accepts, begrudgingly, the help of Thomas(Kai Malima), a concentration camp survivor, and sees for herself, slowly over their shared experiences as provisional allies, that Jewish people don't smell like 'brussel sprouts' and have horns concealed under their hair. Omi tells her: 'You must never feel ashamed of them. Your parents did nothing wrong.' Ironically, these are the words that Jojo has to wrestle with; he was indeed ashamed of Rosie for being unpatriotic, and his father, too; a war deserter. Over time, the boy will realize that he, albeit unintentionally, informed on his own mother. Rosie died because she was living with a party loyalist. The boy could not separate the political from the personal. Jojo's shame, the longer he gets to know Elsa, will grow exponentially, and finally, one day, he'll realize with perfect lucidity that his mother was the real patriot, and did nothing wrong. His mom; his beautiful mom, who tried to teach him that real Germans sing and dance, fall in and out of love; not kill, was right.For the time being, Jojo isn't quite there yet. 'Jojo Rabbit' doesn't seem to understand that Elsa suffers from Stockholm Syndrome. Jojo used this Jewish girl as research for a book-in-progress about the origins of her people. Elsa is leaving Berlin with the boy who stabbed her.'Lore' ends with the holocaust, a metaphoric one. Hannalore's mother, the wife of a war criminal, kept a porcelain menagerie on her dresser as a young girl. A doe at repose, Mutti's favorite that the oldest daughter carried with her from home; she saves for last, crushing this memento of her family's Nazi-affiliated past with the heel of a 'store-bought' shoe. She scatters the porcelain animal body parts on her mother's dresser, mirroring the black and white photos of the concentration camps.As a young girl, an officer's daughter, Hannalore would have snapped that rabbit's neck without any hesitation. She would have been one of the girls snickering at Jojo's reluctance to kill the rabbitJojo was a mama's boy.This horrified him.After the song is over, and the dancing stops, that's when the real horror begins.Lore had bad parents, whereas Jojo's mother was Jojo Lioness, but the cub couldn't see the urban sprawl of the German forest for the trees.",2,9,52,18 November 2019
Green Book," Choose Kermit
","'He's sick. He got poison in his system,' the black man explains to his Machiavellian host, as being the reason for the white man's anemic condition. Cullen(Sidney Poitier) and 'Joker'(Tony Curtis), once warring fugitives on the run, to both men's surprise, are still chained to each other, even after the woman, an unconditional racist(Cara Williams), unshackles their wrists. It matters to both of them, if the other one lives or dies. John's concern for Cullen is beyond the woman's comprehension.'What did I do wrong? the single mother asks, when John finds out that the directions she gave Cullen is a death trap. Nothing but bogs and quicksand; nothing to be concerned about, because a black man is nothing. 'Why do you get so excited about that 'Negro' for?' she screams. It's the late-fifties. The incident involving those three civil rights workers who went missing in Neshoba County was still a little ways off. For now, it's Mississippi simmering. But what was the audience thinking; these average everyday people from an era who internalized institutional racism like breathing? This mutual respect, this male bonding of disparates, welded together by altruistic materials, to a large degree, must have estranged them. Even to the most progressive-minded moviegoer, down deep inside, there existed a latent feeling of repulsion, a self-awareness they would never own up to having. These proto-liberals may have loved jazz, Jackie Robinson, and the idea of civil rights, but when put to the test, in life, or being a voyeur in the dark observing an imitation of life, they recoiled at the idea of a white man choosing friendship(WITH A 'NEGRO'!) over romance(WITH A WOMAN!). Before the sea change in 1964, the year that gave black people the right to vote, the spectacle of a black man in a white woman's house, chained, and then, shockingly unchained, was new to film language. The grandparents sitting in these movie palaces, lest not we forget, saw D.W. Griffith's 'The Birth of a Nation' as small children. They remember Gus pursuing Flora on the mountain. Gus was up to no good; he had only one thing on his mind. It was rhetoric. It was propaganda. It worked. They remember Flora jumping off the mountain. They blamed Gus for the suicide. Cullen, in their estimation, should sleep outside, not on the couch. But they know, however, that mother and son have no choice; they don't begrudge the woman's need to compromise. The small family is counting on 'Joker' to get them out of this one-horse town. The boy's mother listens to Cullen. John needs a bed. It must be something he ate. Their last meal, frog, roasted over an open fire, is the likely culprit for his indisposed condition. Made in 1958, Stanley Kramer's 'The Defiant Ones' should be one for the time capsule. But, alas, 'time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', into the future.'The white chauffeur just bought a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He presumes that all black folks love the sizzling and popping sounds a broiler makes in an oil vat. On a nondescript Kentucky two-lane road, in 'Green Book', Tony Vallelonga(Viggo Mortensen) passes a drumstick over the car seat headrest to his employer, the classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley(Mahershala Ali). He practically waves the drumstick in Don's face. Stop. Rewind. Mull over this for a second. Who is the boss here: the Copacabana ball-busting bouncer with the hair-trigger temper, or the refined musician adored by the cognoscenti who live in the rarefied world of 'haute couture' circles. Tony should ask first. After all, the two just met. It wasn't so long ago that the Italian-American working stiff, a husband and father of small boys, removed two empty glasses from their kitchen sink because the lips of black men, plumbers who fixed their leaky pipes, drank his wife's freshly squeezed lemonade. He places them gently in the rubbish can. This illiberal action is the predictable repercussions from living in an insular world. Tony's extended family, under the pretense of watching a baseball game, keeps a watchful eye over Dolores(Linda Cardellini) and her unwanted guests. The audience can infer that if Tony was the person of the house, the help would have found themselves drinking from a water hose. Tony, at this juncture, is an honest-to-goodness, unrepentant bigot. But 'Green Book' treats his antipathetic views toward the 'other' with a light touch. Played for laughs, Tony refuses to put Don's luggage into the trunk. There is a standoff between this Italian chauffeur and an Indian manservant. Finally, Amit(Iqbal Theba), flabbergasted at such hubris, in a gracious display of humility, relents and does the job. Ha-ha, right? Later, on wheels, Tony needs a roadside bathroom break, somewhere, in woods. The hired man leaves, but then on second thought, returns and grabs his wallet off the dashboard. Don should be outraged and offended, and yet, he gives his driver a bewildered look, when a look of anger and resentment would have been the right emotional visage.Somewhere along that long drive through the deeply segregated south, 'Green Book' needed a scene in which Tony opens up about his issues with people of color, a man-to-man talk. The bouncer and the musician, of course, would become lifelong pals, but the film portrays the bond as a foregone conclusion, and skips the growing pains that led up to their mutual respect for each other. 'I've never had fried chicken in my life,' Don says with dignity barely intact. He should be aghast now, not later on at the plantation house, by this racially-charged slight, but because 'Green Book' is calibrated to be a feel-good movie, the pianist reacts in a genteel manner, which would seem at odds with an employer being taunted by his paid employee, a subordinate. The car should be ordered to stop, but the car keeps moving, because the filmmaker keeps moving without breaks, without looking at the rear-view mirror. When Don asks for 'plates and utensils', then complains about how this tactile approach to eating fried chicken will sully his hands and stain the blanket on his lap with grease, the musician's persnickety mannerisms has the accidental effect of being an alternative minstrel show. Don Shirley dons whiteface. Later, the ugly stereotype gets reintroduced, in which the honored guest at a formal dinner, is served the aforementioned bird by his host, a patron of the arts. Needless to say, the music lovers who join Don at the fancy table, coos in approval. Finally, here is racism, without the kid gloves, without training wheels.But it's too little, too late. The intended shock that we're supposed to feel never registers in full. The horror of the moment has been destigmatized, because such categorical pigeonholing that dictates the preferences and abhorrences of lower men as deemed by the gatekeepers, played as comedy the first time around. When all the brown flesh is torn away from the drumstick, Don asks, 'What do we do about the bones?' The presumptuous chauffeur takes his skeleton breast and flings it out the car window. The piano virtuoso does so, likewise. He can learn so much from Tony.'BlacKkKlansman' ends with an epilogue, a blowtorch of a coda that sets fire to the William Shakespeare quote: 'What's past is prologue.' Unlike 'Green Book', Spike Lee knows the story of love and hate isn't over. It's the story of Kermit and Pepe. Two sides, watching 'The Defiant Ones' for the first time, sees the frog that best suits their ideology. Will one side notice that John is the one that gets sick? 'Green Book' means well. It's not a bad film; it's just the wrong film for our times.The road trip isn't over.",5,3,5,26 February 2019
