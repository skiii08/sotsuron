The New World," The most moving movie i have ever seen
","I signed in the website only to write this about this movie this movie reminded me why i love movies this much there are emotions in its raw form , love , hate, happiness , sadness and grief . without embellishment or falsification in the lowest possible words but with image , photography and mime you can live every moment in the film, I think that the director depicts the extent of innocence and beauty better than any poet or author estimated. I loved this actor Q'Orianka Kilcher especially when she was interacting with her hands to express herself , there is no words to how i was touched , she was the driving force behind this movie and i can understand why she would have been so young to capture the true innocence in her >",10,2,4,13 August 2011
