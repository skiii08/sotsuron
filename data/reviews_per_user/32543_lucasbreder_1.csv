The Lobster," A very good idea, but somewhat poorly executed
","An absurdist comedy that brushes into the weirdness of social pressure regarding relationships (and being single). The movie has it's moments, mixing disturbing moments with dark humour, using clear and not-so-clear allegories to illustrate basic human needs such as love, sex and acceptance, and how we reinvent ourselves in order to try to find a partner. Also, it offers funny and disturbing insights on the great pressure society makes in this area. However, the excess of the absurd in the human relations tend to make them over simplistic and not human at all. Therefore, there are several ocasions where the movie could have better explored the complexities and subtleties of the theme within relationships, but didn't, for being over simplistic. At the end of the movie you get the sensation It didn't really get anywhere that made some sense, and that the basic idea of the script could have been much better executed",6,2,2,8 February 2017
