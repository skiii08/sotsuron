Hereditary," Disappointed
","After reading reviews, I was hopeful. I heard it was a slow beginning, but was albeit horrific. I'm not a huge horror movie watcher and previously have had many sleepless nights due to the rare horror movies I saw. I prepared myself for a couple nights, knowing how scared I personally get, to watch this movie. It was a fine story line, but truly laughable. I didn't find myself scared at all. After reading reviews, I was so excited to finally watch a quality horror movie. I'm only 21, so maybe I'm just desensitized, but wow- horror is dead. Nothing scares people anymore, including this film.",2,1,2,16 October 2018
