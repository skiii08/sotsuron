3:10 to Yuma," Classic Western Movie
","This movie has a thrilling adventure which keeps me more interested in the characters and gives me a little taste of what actually went down in the old west. Ben Wade and Dan Evans are smart and intelligent characters who add strength, excitement, and suspense to the movie along with superb acting. The Supporting cast did a great job as well and in particular, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, and Logan Lerman. Although I do have to say that I was surprised to see Luke Wilson in this movie but I guess he can fit in the western style and he pulls it off pretty good. So if you're a fan of western movies you will not be disappointed with this one.",10,1,2,1 August 2008
Cloverfield," Left Unfulfilled
",When I heard about this movie and read what it was about I thought that it would be pretty good. Also after seeing the reviews for this movie I saw that people really didn't like the hand held camera that was put in this movie. So as I was watching the movie the hand held camera really wasn't that bad and plus it's something kind of different. When I saw the monster on the camera I thought that was pretty cool but after awhile I thought it was playing peek-a-boo with everybody because I didn't really get to see it that often. It just seemed like all I was watching were a bunch of people running around scared and that's about it. On the bright side the visuals were fantastic and the acting was pretty good. Overall good movie but I'm hoping that Cloverfield 2 will be much better.,7,0,0,1 August 2008
Ratatouille," Great Family Movie
",I really liked this movie and I have to say that a rat helping and controlling a boy is kind of weird but at least it's something different and it kind of makes the movie even more special. The visuals are outstanding especially when Remy goes to the roof of a building and he looks out and you get a spectacular view of Paris which really impressed me. The characters are all great and to name one that I really liked was Linguini because the journey he goes through and the challenges he faces to become the best cook in the kitchen are pretty thrilling. I really enjoyed this movie and anybody out there who likes family movies will like this one.,10,0,1,1 August 2008
The Incredibles," Incredible Movie
",This was an excellent movie which had non-stop action and the story was perfect. The actors did a terrific job doing the voice-overs on the characters and you couldn't ask for anything better. I really liked Mrs. Hogenson because she was really funny and she kind of added more humor to the movie. My favorite superheroes in this movie would probably be Mr. Incredible just because the way he can lift just about anything he puts his hands on. I really liked Dash as well because of the running ability that he has and I think that it would be a cool specialty to have as a superhero. Overall great movie and I'm hoping that they will make an Incredibles 2 and that would be wonderful if they did. Don't miss out on this fun movie.,10,0,0,2 August 2008
Stardust," A Thrilling Adventure
","After seeing this movie I have to say that I was really impressed with it. I really liked the adventure in this movie and it was really thrilling to watch.Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job acting as Lamia and so did Charlie Cox acting as Tristan. I was really surprised on how Robert De Niro acted his role out because i'm not used to him acting like that but still he did a fabulous job as always. The ghosts in this movie who follow Septimus around were kind of funny and entertaining at the same time.The visuals in this movie were spectacular but I do have to say that in one part where the goat gets thrown into the wall you can tell that it was a fake one. There was also this one part where Lamia is a very old witch and right away she turns into a beautiful women and I thought that the visuals in that part were amazing. Another part where the visuals were outstanding was the part when Lamia created a hotel to fool Yvaine. Also to mention that at the end of the movie when the glass was shattering all over the place, that was pretty amazing as well.So like I said earlier this movie really impressed me and it will impress you as well.",9,2,3,2 August 2008
Transformers," Great Job Michael Bay
","This is an excellent movie and Michael Bay does a terrific job directing it. The story is pretty unique and it's not your typical story but it's basically about these groups of robots called the Autobots and the Decepticons who are after this cube called the Allspark which is on earth and whoever's hands it lands into will grant them unlimited power. The visual effects are just jaw-dropping and I don't know how they do it but they did an outstanding job. I really liked the parts at the end of the movie where the Autobots and the Decepticons battle it out for the Allspark but I would have liked to see more battles take place between them which would have made this movie even more spectacular. The acting is pretty good and I think Shia did the best job out of all of them and I knew he could pull it off in this movie. Overall it was pretty good, go check it out.",9,1,3,1 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best Harry Potter Movie So Far
","When Harry Potter first came out I really wasn't that interested in watching it. But one day I turned on the television and I saw that Harry Potter was on and when I started to watch it I thought that it was pretty good and ever since then I have been a Harry Potter fan and it still continues to impress me. After seeing the trailer for this movie I knew that it would be another great Harry Potter movie and I was right. The acting in this movie was fantastic. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, and all of the other actors did a great job. The CGI in this movie was unbelievable and I can't believe how well it really stood out. This movie has a good amount of action in it but mostly in the parts where Harry is competing in the Triwizard Tournament which gets pretty exciting to watch. I didn't really see any flaws in the movie but I do have to say that I hope that the future Harry Potter movies keep improving because there is always room for improvement and the series is on the right track in doing so.",8,0,1,1 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Fantastic Movie
",This movie is action packed with an electrifying adventure and George Lucas does a good job directing it. The battle scenes throughout this movie were sensational and the fight scenes with the were amazing. I was just blown away by the visuals of this movie especially at the end of the movie when Anakin and Obi-Wan are battling it out on a planet called Mustafar that is completely dominated by lava and that part makes the movie even more stunning. The main characters do a terrific job acting which leads to success. One thing I do have to say is that I think Yoda needs to work on his English more because he is always getting his words mixed up. But overall this is a very energetic movie that will not disappoint.,10,0,5,1 August 2008
