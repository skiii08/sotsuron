Miracle," Thanks, Guys
","Thanks mostly to the guys that actually won the gold, but thanks as well to the actor/hockey players that made the film possible. You guys were all awesome, and it had to be hard.............Did Kurt Russel actually slap on ccm's and skate?......I need to know that! Thank you for a great movie.....to the cast, thank you.......you have no idea what it means to a guy in my generation, that was there....thank you! You guys all seem very nice........most of you you are playing somewhere. Reguardless, I wish all of you the best of luck. I'll bet you were all thinking what it might have been like to play in the olympics.....some of you may..............remember 1980.......you guys were in diapers, but I was there!......I love you all, Patrick",Null,2,3,3 December 2004
Miracle," What a great Movie!
","I can sincereley say, as a 40 year old guy, I was there! I was maybe 3 years too young to have tried for the team, and I pursued other things, like golf, after it happened.....but I wish I was 3 or 4 years older....I could have tried for that team. I recently got cut from my pick-up league team, because I turned 40 last February 14th.......they let me slide for a while..but the age limit is 40. My knees are shot, anyway........but when I watch that movie.....I cry like a child, because I remember it, and I played ice hockey for too many years. I have friends, from the NY Islanders.......my buddies from the dynasty!!...Clark Gillies, Bobby Ny, Eddy Westfall, Bill Torre......I love you all....and I love the young guys that had the balls to do it for us in 1980!",Null,2,3,3 December 2004
