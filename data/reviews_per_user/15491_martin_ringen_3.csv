The Equalizer," Very violent and nothing new
","This review does not contain spoilers. I am a huge action fan, but i am also 30y, and have been watching many action movies so when you read my review you must take that into account. We have all seen this before. This movie brings nothing new to the table. Denzel movies are usually pretty good, and has a twist to the regular action movie plot, but not this one. This movie is just straight forward. Its also very violent. I like violent movies like 'the raid' for instance. But this movie just plays on violence because it has nothing else. It makes the violence seem like a trick to keep you watching. I watched the whole thing thru anyways, don't make the same mistake.",4,4,6,13 December 2014
John Wick," Cool, Simple and Fun to watch
","This movie is not a deep film with a lot of twists and strong characters, but that's okay because it doesn't try to be either. This is just a fun movie to watch. It's cool in every sense of the word. The use of the camera is very slick, and the texting gives it a cartoonish feel to it with suits the plot.Keanu Reeves plays this hardcore hit-man who goes on a wild rampage thru the Russian mafia after the kid of the boss kills Reeves' dog. So, not the most original plot. But as a action movie it's good. Nobody likes a dog killer so you are really on Keanu's side, and also he has some amazing shooting and fighting skills that are fun to watch. You will not get smarter watching this movie, but you will have fun.",7,3,9,17 January 2015
Nightcrawler," Amazing dialogue and thrilling storyline with an edge
","This movie is one of the best movies of 2014. It stands out from other movies, because of it 's original manuscript, really good acting and amazing dialogue. It's all about Gyllenhaal's character in this movie, and we follow his rise in a shady TV news channel. The main character is a clear sociopath, although that is not clear to him. He is so driven to create a career for himself, that he pushes his colleague to the extreme and manipulates the situations around him for his benefits. The movie is a thrilling. It's full of suspense because of the main character's unexpected actions. Gyllenhaal's acting is award winning, if you ask me. He makes the character believable even though some of the things he says and do seem totally crazy. The movie is a clear criticism to the news industry, but also to the ever growing individualistic world we live in. People with no regard for others well being, cynics, are often rewarded in todays world, as in this movie.",9,4,7,21 January 2015
