The New World," Didn't think it would ever end.
","I can't remember when I have ever seen a more boring film. I know it was only two hours long, but it felt like twice that. The script is completely disjointed. It felt as if it had been written, then re-written, then re-written again and pieces were taken from each version and thrown together. The editing is choppy. Colin Farrel, a lousy actor to begin with, mumbles his way through the horrendous script. James Horner who is usually an asset to a film provides music that is intrusive and overly bombastic. I couldn't wait for the movie to finally be over. The only reason I didn't stop watching in the middle was because I figured it had to get better. Unfortunately, it never did.",1,0,4,2 September 2006
