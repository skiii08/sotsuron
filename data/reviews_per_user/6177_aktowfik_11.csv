Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A lesson in bad taste
","I have no backgrounds about this TV show, so I watched this movie with a virgin mind. I daresay it hit the bottom of silly and toilet humor that Monty Python and even John Waters could never dream of. U get a nice message about Kazakhstan from the early minutes of the movie: He kisses his sister with passion in her lips and says she's the best whore in town. He is a racist who hates Jews. He is a sex maniac who defecates and masturbates in public, and brings his excreta and his whore to decent American people sitting on dinner table. He thinks the elevator is his hotel room, and travels with a chicken in his bag. I hate to know what the Kazakh people thought about the movie, but it can't be compared to the infamous Indian supper scene in Temple of Doom. I think it's more like this racist impression of Amazon people in Cannibal Holocaust. There is a naked wrestling scene between two men that marks a new era of debauchery in Cine history. Anything for a laugh (I admit U laugh many times, but U lose ur self respect all the time). Borat is in fact the only ugly racist in the whole movie... All Americans are nice friendly guys, even the black gang he meets only taught him how to speak and dress like rappers. If he was pretending he exposed America, then he is a total failue.. He only exposed and humiliated Kazakhstan. National anthem is a sacred emblem that should be respected everywhere.. Nobody dared before use the national anthem of a nation in the manner we saw at the end of the movie, with lyrics like 'our prostitutes' etc.... Since Kazakhstan' s religion is mainly Islam, we can assume we're talking about a Muslim in USA post 11-9 era. This s no propaganda, but every Muslim knows that Jewish food is Halal. It's at least safer than Christian food, so no Muslim will get this phobia when a friendly Jewish woman offers him dinner. He even tries to flirt some red necks by wishing that Iraq becomes a parking lot. The message of the film is clear: It's mockery.. Mockery .. and nothing else.",2,5,9,19 March 2007
The Village," Forget about the plot.. Who cares ?
","I don't care about the plot of this movie. I knew from the beginning that there will be a big twist. My 11 YO son foresaw it after 10 minutes, and I don't claim he's a genius. What remains from the works of Mr MNS is THE ATMOSPHERE. He can build the atmosphere of fear and apprehension perfectly in ALL his works. Watch 'The village' alone at 2 am and U will admit that. The jungle surrounded by torch flames, the kids playing courage games, the apprehension and the anticipation. This s fun.. This s real cinema. MNS is a genius, and I daresay he outdid Hitchcok in creation of suspense. Anyway, the curse of Sixth Sense will haunt him forever. He started from the summit .. Nowhere else to go but down.. Being the genius he is he kept struggling and he kept there, but people keep awaiting his fall eagerly.",9,1,3,2 June 2006
Saw III," Too much gore
","What the hell were these guys trying to do when they made this movie ?..They are entirely sick and sadistic, never mind how clever they are. I liked Saw I very much, but for God's sake, these guys don't know the difference between terror, horror and gore. Seeing a trephine done with elementary tools; or a man drowned in pig juice; or a throat cut by a saw is not horror..it's simply disgusting. If you want gore and shock, then any clip from Iraq showing the real slaughtering of a prisoner can do better. The make-up guys did everything possible to prove they earned their buck, and they did it well. My impression is that they made this film as a catalogue documentary for what they can do, so they can make contracts with other production companies. The thrills are childish, like a school kid trying to scare the hell out of the chicks by eating frogs or removing his decayed tooth in front of them. This is disgusting.. It ought to bring some screams , but this is not cinema ..this is not horror. We used to think Lucio Fulci was sick.. Now we know he was a romantic film maker. Apart from that, I can't accept this plot anymore. I can't believe 2 persons are able to design all these satanic demonic shows. This would have taken an army of technicians. The only good thing about this movie is Shawnee Smith... She scared the hell out of me, and everything about her acting was legendary as usual.You can never believe she's not really insane. Her eyes were scary.. Her skin was scary.. her voice was scary... This lady is the most gifted and most underrated actress in Cine business today....",4,3,6,1 March 2007
Cars," Something wrong....
","I liked this movie and I think it's a masterpiece as far as animation movies are concerned. The problem is that I have observed about 20 children of varying ages in random circumstances watching it.. There is something wrong with this movie. kids lose interest in it after the first 15 minutes and they never seem to follow anything. The same children didn't blink or go to the bathroom during 'polar Express', 'Finding Nemo' or 'Ice age'. My humble interpretation is that this movie is OK for adults, but it failed to capture the eluding magic that catches children's attention. Perhaps cars are not interesting like people, animals or fish. That's why I give it 5 on a score of 10. If it was intended for adult audience only it could have scored 8 or 9.",5,1,2,6 February 2007
The Illusionist," Unnecessary twist at all..
","Why the hell should be a twist ?.. This is the new epidemic of today's movies that every film should have a crazy twist, which is, most of the time, totally contrived and irrelevant. Think twice.. The movie was a masterpiece in plot, characters, acting and photography, till the last 5 minutes when the script writer got possessed by the 'Twist demon'. He ruined everything. We have been recruited emotionally for nothing, for the crown prince was innocent. There are many holes in here:1- WHY ? .. Why did the wizard plot such a thing when he could easily escape with the Duchess ?. 2- She wasn't dead, but what about her burial ? How did she escape the sermons ? 3- Where was she hidden all this time ? what if the prince didn't commit suicide ?.. Would she remain hidden for ever ? 4- And above all... How did the inspector know all this and make these conclusions while the train was departing ?.. give me the pieces of the puzzle he connected. He had nothing at all except the wizard was on the train.. 5- So all this was a matter of stage play, so please gimme an explanation for the apparitions we saw, and Norton's disappearance from the stage. Frankly, if the film ended when the train left the station, it would be much powerful. This twist weakened everything like what happened with 'Identity'.",8,0,0,18 July 2007
Saw," Great plot but.....
","This is a hell of a plot. One of the few genius ..most genuine ideas that still exist in the world. Acting is perfect. I have this weak point towards Shawnee Smith and I think her short role was legendary as usual. Photography is great. No cheap thrills of the 'Scream type'. The problem is the same that I felt after seeing 'Identity'. The ending is too contrived .. too odd.. less credible than the whole movie. I think the makers of these movies try to outwit this silly talkative know-it-all guy sitting among the audience; by making the most unexpected ending. This blows the whole logic of the movie.. I have million questions about things I couldn't accept comfortably; but I can't ask any here because they r real spoilers. Anyway, this is one of the best 5 horror movies I saw in the last ten years, and I highly recommend it.",8,0,1,4 June 2005
From Hell," Not that bad
","I think this movie is a real masterpiece. Everything is fabulous and quite convincing. I think nobody showed London like this with the blue fog (It was really blue not white as mistakingly thought), that you could smell the dirt and tremble for cold. I think evaluation of movies depends on mood very much. You can watch the same movie twice, feeling it's a masterpiece on first time, then feeling it's lousy second time, all depending on your state of mind. I can say I watched this movie in my best mental and physical condition and I insist it's a masterpiece. What I hated most was those funny large contact lenses that the killer wears during killing. This is no supernatural horror I guess, so no basis for shape changes. Is there a historical basis for queen Victoria being involved in masonic rites, and Prince Albert getting married to a prostitute ? If not, then It's a crime specially for foreigners like me, who may learn history from movies.",9,4,6,25 January 2005
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Overrated work
","I've seen this film lately, and I totally think it means nothing at all. The makers had their own sexual complexes and hidden perversions, and they couldn't achieve them in real life, so they decided to make a movie !. Just as an excuse to show all these perversions, they talked about Fascism. This could convince audience everywhere that this is some 'political' highly cultural movie, and not just an S&M, B&D, scatological, submission porno flick. In that age everything coming from Europe was considered genius. Any Italian shooting his grandmother's big toe for 3 hours would have been considered a masterpiece maker in America. I think these movies should be put in their right place by now.. They R Nonsense. They can only be fun to watch especially for those who care about these fetishes and perversions. Even if U r normal, still this is a strange thing... STRANGE... Only ..Like watching a dead cat hit by a car on the road. U never enjoy it or feel it's a masterpiece of art.. It's just curious and U simply have to look at it.",3,5,16,9 February 2007
Pulp Fiction," Godfather of the 90's
","Perhaps I am the last one on planet Earth to see this film. I used to think that Tarantino is arrogant and over-rated, but after seeing this I regret all I said. This film is a masterpiece. Like Godfather, it's very rare to find a gangster movie script that puts all this concentration on characters and not the plot. The characters are alive.. full of controversies.. They r real life people. The girl who commits an armed robbery feels desire to pee.. The hit men talking about Hamburger on their way to the kill.. the finding that U have to wash a car with detergents after blowing the brains of a man... The hustle U cause for a drug dealer when trying to inject intra-cardiac adrenaline. This is charming. U don't give a damn about the plot.. Who cares ?... the dialog should be taught in film schools since U can't miss a single word .. They talk about milk shake and Ice cream, but U feel it's more interesting than talking about cocaine and dead gangsters. Everybody is superb.. U can never forget Thurman, Travolta or Jackson.. Even Tarantino's role is very amusing. This genre is a genuine mixture between film Noir and comedy.. I think I must see 'Kill Bill' once more, for I didn't like it at first time.",10,1,3,22 March 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The final word in the myth..
","No wonder that such a great director has made this movie. What hew did was simply magic. He brought horror to new horizons of poetry. The cine language is very rich and every shot is worth seeing many times. The cast is perfect but, on the contrary to many people, I think that Anthony Hopkins's acting is over, exaggerated and convulsive somehow.",Null,2,3,16 February 1999
Slumdog Millionaire," a Real MasterPiece That will last long time after the movie..
","when I first heard about the buzz the movie made, I felt that it was another ordinary movie with an interesting story. That's what made me watch it in first place ..After 2 hours of non stop entertainment and emotions that will make you live in the slums with their childhood and adventures ..It's a realistic picture of the slums so I think it's one of the best motion picters of all time, and it makes me know the power of destiny and hope ..so nice work Danny Boyle and the rest of the crew who made one hell of a movie ..and for the people who didn't watch this movie I can assure you that you won't be disappointed..I give it 10/10 ..",10,3,8,27 February 2009
