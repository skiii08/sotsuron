E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Great Move All Around!
",Sorry. I really needed to fix the previous comment too this film on here. It is false. This movie is great! But like the previous comment stated that this film was the highest grossing film of all time. That is false by far! It may have made a lot of money. But nothing as surpassed Titanic yet. I am sorry. :( Get your facts before posting you imbecile. All around this is heart warming movie and is meant for all ages. You will not regret it. But nothing has surpassed Titanic yet. I am sorry. :( Get your facts before posting you imbecile. Titanic is the highest grossing. That makes me angry that people do not get their fact straight.,10,0,1,24 April 2008
