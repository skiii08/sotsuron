Moneyball," A great sports movie that will appeal to a wide audience
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : MONEYBALLONE LINE REVIEW : A great sports movie that will appeal to a wide audience.RATING : See it in theaters (Rating System: 'See it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time.')NO SPOILERSIt's 2002 and Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) must find a way to replace three of his team's great players. The players were traded away to other teams, gutting Beane's team, and his chances of going to the playoffs. Billy's problem is that he can't afford to recruit quality players on the $41M in his budget - especially when he is competing with teams with budgets in the $120 million range.While visiting a competing team's front office on a deal, Billy meets young Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Brand has a degree in economics from Yale university and sees baseball strictly in statistical terms. He reasons that a player should be picked for his ability to get on base, not for how many home runs he hits. Billy does his research and realizes he may have found the solution to his problem and recruits Brand to help him reorganize the Oakland team.But Billy is met with resistance on all fronts. The veteran recruiters are angry that Billy is listening to some young upstart with no experience in baseball. The team manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman) won't play the roster the way Billy wants, thus thwarting any mathematics that may improve their chances. Even the players don't believe Billy will last the season.Also, Billy is facing some difficulties with his family. His ex-wife Sharon (Robin Wright) is married to a wimpish guy who doesn't understand sports, but tries to for Billy's sake. His adorable daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) is concerned he may lose his job. The way things are going, Billy secretly feels the same way. And we're off...Those who know me know that I'm not a sports fan. I find most sports dull and avoid watching them as I think watching other people do something is a colossal waste of time - especially compared to actually doing it. However, watching Billy Bean resurrect the A's was a joy. The movie is structured nicely with elements of sports, relationships, and (especially if you are not a sports follower) suspense.Brad Pitt seems to walk through this role effortlessly. I'm reminded of Robert Redford and his baseball movie 'The Natural' (1984). While the roles are very different, they both require a kind of charisma that these actors bring to their roles. Pitt produced the film, which shows his commitment to it. We watch Beane exude confidence in front of his boss, sales savvy when making a deal,he reassures his daughter, and mentors Brand. But privately, we see his uncertainty when things are not going well.Jonah Hill is best known for his comedic roles ('Superbad') but plays a very stoic, even stereotypical nerd here. His comic timing comes into good use in several scenes where Brand's naiveté serves as a contrast to Billy's bravado. However, the character is written very flatly. We don't see a lot of variation in Brand's emotions. Still, Hill does a good job of delivering the character that does the math, and still learns about baseball along the way.The movie has some minor flaws. The relationships outside of the world of baseball are only lightly touched upon. There are really only 3 scenes with the daughter - one of which is delivered by CD. The relationship with the ex-wife is amounts to one awkward moment. But that's okay, as the movie is really about turning the team around and breaking with convention. Even so, Billy's relationships with the players is only lightly covered in a sort of montage. Without giving much away, we don't really see much growth in the man, only that he succeeds in what he set out to do.As a non-sports fan, I was very entertained by this movie. I didn't know the outcome beforehand, as some baseball followers may have. We get to see a wonderful Rags-to-Riches story told very well. Most of the performances may have been underpowered, even flat. But that served to buoy the Brad Pitt character. For a suspenseful story that moved along at a comfortable pace, I recommend you 'see it in theaters.'",Null,0,0,24 September 2011
The Avengers," Hulk Smash, Iron Man Fly, Thor Grimace, Humans Run!
","RATING: See it in theaters (Rating System: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the instant download,' 'Don't waste your time')Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the half-brother of Thor has returned to Earth to pave the way for a wave of destruction at the hands of evil aliens. But secret agency S.H.E.I.L.D has been preparing by analyzing the mysterious Tesseract – an blue-glowing cube of unharnessed infinite power. Loki steals the Tesseract and it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of S.H.I.E.L.D to pull together a team of the world's first super heroes to defeat Loki and return the Tesseract from whence it came. The heroes are known as The Avengers and they are Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).The Avengers is a recipe for disaster. It is an ensemble cast of players, each of whom is a third magnitude star in his (or her) own right. Whenever you get this many egos in the room at one time, there is bound to be in-fighting. And in fact, this is what happens in the movie. The heroes can't get along. They jockey for alpha-male status, only to find that they are equals, each with his own unique strength. And yet, both on the screen and in reality, they find a balance. Each actor brings his own ingredients to the mix. And each actor plays his (or her) character to perfection; as if it were their own film.Another problem is backstory – there is a lot of it. Some of these characters have been brought to the collective consciousness in their own debut films of the last couple of years (Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and Captain America). If you've seen their films then you have an idea of who they are already. The other two needed a bit more introduction and it was skillfully interlaced with the action.And then there's the problem of interaction – 6 main players plus Fury and Loki implies 28 different relationships. And that's a hard act to pull off in just 142 minutes.Still, writer/director Joss Whedon ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' 'Serenity') pulls it all off with apparent ease. The story is relentless in its pace and still fills us in on who the characters are and what they contribute. There's an amazing scene when the characters are at their lowest point (close friends are dead, the team is dispersed) and they expose each other's weaknesses. The souls of our heroes are left bare. This gives us nowhere to go but up.And indeed, up we go. To beat their combined foe, the team must pull together: each member using their special gifts to turn back an invading force.But as amazing as the film is, there are problems. The last climactic scenes are a series of improbable battles in the heart of New York City. Mind you, these battles are carried out with much more precision than the garbage whirlwind of the Transformers films. But, due to the PG-13 nature of the film, we find little bloodshed and a lot of tumbling skyscrapers.Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with the film: just how strong are these super heroes? Hulk, besides being hulking, is apparently impervious to direct bullet and missile fire. Captain America can apparently withstand the full force of alien hand grenades. Iron Man takes a licking and keeps on ticking. And Thor, with his mighty hammer seems to be able to stop anything, but still goes flying when monsters whip their tails. And for the other two (who remind me of the Professor and Marianne from Gilligan's Island – 'and the rest'), when there is a battle they are sent off to do reconnaissance or direct traffic lest they be trampled or crushed. They may be more of a liability than they are worth.Finally, I want to talk about the unsung hero of the Marvel universe: Stan Lee. Lee has a cameo appearance in every Marvel action movie. He is held as sort of the progenitor of modern hero lore. As such, he is a special icon in the comic book (and now movie) realm. All legends spring from his fount. There is a name for that kind of hero – they are called gods.So, for outstanding story, characters, special effects and an amazing 'boot' (not even a reboot) of a new franchise, I recommend you see it in theaters.",7,3,9,4 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazing special effects, flat story.
","STAR WARS MOVIE REVIEW : STAR WARS I - THE PHANTOM MENACE IN 3D(This is a special edition of the Weekly Movie Review. In this edition I will follow the upcoming series of remastered 3D Star Wars films. But I will be reviewing them as though I've never seen a Star Wars film and the films are being released for the very first time.)MINI-REVIEW: Amazing special effects, flat story.SPOILERS WITHIN!RATING : See it in theaters (for the special effects and 3D)Qui-Gon Jinn is Jedi Knight – a mystical and powerful fighter for the New Republic. His apprentice is young Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Jedi are aligned and imbued with the power of the Force – which is a power that permeates, controls, and is controlled by the wills of the Jedi. Together they are charged with negotiating an agreement between the Trade Federation who have blockaded the small planet of Naboo. Little do they know that the Trade Federation is but an extension of a dark figure who has designs to overthrow the Galactic Republic. But the Jedi are ambushed and they escape to Naboo below where they find that Queen Amidala has been taken captive and is being pressured to sign a treaty against her will.On Naboo they meet Jar Jar Binks of the Gungan clan. Jar Jar is an amphibious being with a Jamaican accent. Together, they free Queen Amidala and the troupe escape to nearby desert planet of Tatooine. There, they meet a young boy (Anikan Skywalker) who is 'strong with the force'. The stage is set and we're off!I've heard a lot of commotion about this new movie by veteran filmmaker George Lucas ('American Graffitti', 'Red Tails'). So I was excited about what lay before me.Overall I found the movie to be a sweeping, epic: A confusing tale of incomprehensible political intrigue, shoot-em-up action, and slap-stick comedy. It is full of characters to keep track of with no one character taking center stage. As such it is a tough film to follow. The scenes take place on three planets and at least two star ships.Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is played with an even keel and cool that betrays the wisdom and venerability of the character. Neeson strolls through this role effortlessly. He is also supposed to be something of a rebel among the Jedi (who are a pretty contemplative bunch).Jar Jar Binks is a hapless, clumsy, CGI rendered, Jamaican amphibian who is adopted by Qui-Gon Jinn for reasons I can't understand. This is quite possible the most annoying character in all of film history. And the way he is played, borders on racist. His behavior is reminiscent of the old Amos and Andy radio and TV Shows of the 1950s. The young boy Anikan Skywalker is played by cherubic Jake Lloyd. If this kid's job was to look cute and have no emotions, then he should get an Oscar. He's pretty much a doll baby with a nice coif. I suspect the actor was selected so as not to steal any scenes from Neeson. Mission accomplished. Even the other children in the movie are incredibly bad actors. I have no idea what the criteria were for choosing these kids – they would have been better as CGI.SPOILER ALERTThe movie plods along with scene after scene of political intrigue. There is a wonderful speeder race that looks like a futuristic Ben Hur remake. And there's some amazing sword fighting with these things called 'Light Sabers.' Those fight scenes are worth waiting for. They hearken back to the days of swashbuckling stories of the 50's.The climax is a four-way battle scene on Naboo that seems to be created to appeal to three different audiences. On the ground, the Gungans are fighting a sea of robot warriors. In the sky, fighter pilots are attacking a huge battle station in a scene that makes 'Red Tails' look like a cocktail party. In the Queen's castle, Amidala leads her closes allies to overtake the Trade Federation leaders in a running gun battle. And finally, in the bowels of the castle's flight deck, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are fighting the very scary-looking Sith Lord Darth Maul. Again, never has there been a more thrilling sword fight.In the air, young Anikan has accidentally taken off in a space fighter and blown up the battle station. A more impossible sequence of accidents could not possibly have been imagined and it strains the limits of the willing suspension of disbelief. This again seems to be aimed at the kiddies in the audience.At the end of the day (and at the end of this 3-hour film) it is best not to think too hard about what is going on here. 'Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace in 3D' is a classic serial action film. The reasons for the action are of no consequence. What is important is the action itself. The characters are put in positions of desperation that require acts of heroism that excite and thrill the audience. Just like the old serials of the 1950's. They just don't make them like that anymore. And maybe there is a reason for that.I can't really recommend this movie based on its story. I recommend that you see it for the spectacle. Don't try to make sense of it. Just let it wash over you and enjoy the ride. So for a flimsy yet complicated story with the most amazing action scenes you'll ever see, I recommend you see it in theaters.",7,2,6,12 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Drawn-out prequel to the final chapter
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : TWILIGHT : BREAKING DAWN – PART ONEMINI-REVIEW : Drawn-out prequel to the final chapterRATING : Wait for the instant download – if you must (Rating System: 'Watch it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time')Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are back and they are going to get married. The marriage goes off without a hitch. While Jacob (Taylor Laughtner) is a bit put out, he makes his peace with it. That is until he learns that Bella plans to let Edward make a woman of her before getting turned into a vampire. 'He'll kill you,' he warns as he knows vampires go into a frenzy during 'maritals' (we guess).But Edward is able to restrain himself and only manages to wreck the bedroom. Strangely, Bella becomes pregnant in the short time they are on honeymoon – and the fetus (baby) is growing rapidly. And we're off...I recently watch the first three incarnations of the 'Twilight' series at home before going to the theater to see 'Breaking Dawn'. I thought they were pretty unimpressive stories, but easy to sit through. Breaking Dawn, however, suffers from the fact that it is a mere set-up for the final chapter. There just wasn't enough material to make a full movie. To its credit, the movie pretty much stands on its own with a good beginning, middle, and conclusion. But the scenes that get us to that conclusion are excruciatingly protracted. This movie lasted two hours and could easily have fit in half that time.There are a number of huge plot holes in this film. Like, why doesn't anyone in the Cullen coven realize that vampire/human sex could create a fast-growing embryo? I mean, the head of the clan is a doctor. The other problems I have would spoil things for you – but at some point I would suggest you ask yourself how digestion works in the 'Twilight' world.The real standout in this film, however, was Taylor Laughtner as werewolf Jacob Black. His character is a truly epic hero. He undergoes a transformation from loner to protector and without giving too much away, I expect we'll see him become a leader in the next film. And Laughtner delivers some really solid performances. He is intense, funny, angry, sensitive just a fine array of emotions for an arguably secondary character. I saw him in 'Abduction' and was not overly impressed. In the previous two 'Twilight' films, and 'Abduction' his job was to be buff and more buff – and to run a lot - shirtless. While he manages to keep his shirt on in most of 'Breaking Dawn', he is the conscience of this film and his performances really support the hum-drum of his partners. And while we're on the subject of werewolves, they are the most interesting characters in the Twilight series. The boys in the tribe, whether in human or wolf form, are always huddling, hanging out, and rough-housing together. And the CGI wolves (while surprisingly huge) are beautiful animals. The actors are interesting to look at and have some substantial secondary plots. Compared, in contrast, to the Cullen clan who seem to just walk around ghost-like with no real relationships.I have to admit, I'm only watching 'Twilight' because it is a phenomenon and I want to be able to talk about it around the water cooler. If I were to give my honest opinion of this film, I'd recommend that you don't waste your time. It is a simplistic tale and you won't walk away from the theater with anything more than you walked in with. But if you've seen the previous movies or are a fan of the books then I recommend you 'wait for the instant download,' because this is just a protracted episode.A final note: I have also been watching the 'Underworld' series in anticipation of the upcoming release of 'Underworld: Awakening,' (which also is a vampire/werewolf movie). Once I've reviewed the final chapter of the 'Twilight' series and 'Awakening' I plan a comparison of the two franchises. I think there will be some interesting parallels.",4,8,11,24 November 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Engaging romantic comedy with a Shakespearian twist
","CRAZY, STUPID, LOVEONE LINE REVIEW: Engaging romantic comedy with a Shakespearian twist.RATING: See it in theaters. (rating system: 'see it in theaters', 'wait for the instant download', 'don't waste your time')NO SPOILERSThe film opens with Cal (Steve Carell) being informed by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) that she wants a divorce. After 25 years of wedded bliss that started in High School, this comes as a great shock to Cal. He starts hanging out at a local bar where lounge lizard, local slickster Jacob (Ryan Gosling) takes pity on our schlemiel and takes him in hand to give him a make-over. Cal then goes on to bed 9 women and turns into a slick dude himself.If this were any ordinary movie, the rest of the plot would be obvious. It doesn't give away too much to say that one of the women Cal conquers turns out to be his son's teacher (Marisa Tomei). In fact, the movie plays very much along Hollywood formula lines that the non-Hollywood ending is a complete surprise.I wish I could tell you more. But to do so would spoil the film for you. Steve Carell is a master of the underplayed comedian. Julianne Moore is lovely at age 50 (although she claims to be 44 in the film – it is a comedy after all). Emma Stone is smart-sexy. And a special appearance by Kevin Bacon was not unwelcome.You might 'wait for the instant download' but I recommend you 'see it in theaters' because you won't want to have the ending spoiled for you around the water cooler.",Null,0,1,12 August 2011
Midnight in Paris," Light romantic comedy as told by the master
","ONE LINE REVIEW : Light romantic comedy as told by the master. RATING : Wait for the Instant Download (Ratings: 'See it in the theater', 'Wait for the Instant Download', 'Don't Bother')NO SPOILERS'Midnight in Paris' finds Gil (Owen Wilson), a successful screenwriter and script doctor, on vacation in Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy). Gil is taken with the city and contemplates living there and finishing his novel. (He imagines that he was born in the wrong time and should have been in Paris when the great writers lived and worked there.) Opposed to Paris, his fiancé wants to live in Malibu while Gil works in Hollywood. Gil likes to take long walks in Paris. During one of his walks he is picked up by an antique motor car that whisks him back to the 1920's where he meets his idols and a fetching young woman, Adriana (Marion Cotillard).This is a Nice Little Picture. Owen Wilson is basically playing Woody Allen, talking out loud what goes on in Allen's head, I presume. The jokes are mild (fair and balanced jabs at Republicans and retorts about Democrats). The characters are cartoonish, even stereotypical. And it is all very charming. Gil meets F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda (the adorable Alison Pill), Picasso, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Ernest Hemmingway, and many other colorful characters. They all give Gil advice on what it is to be an artist.About the only thing I actually hated was Allen's explanation of the point of the film. We get a close up of Gil's face as he reasons it all out for us. I think most people who watch this film will be able to do the reckoning that is necessary to appreciate the message. My good friend Martin Bennett taught me the phrase 'on the nose' – which is used when a writer has a character express their emotions for the audience. I hesitate (twice) to judge Woody Allen (who puts out a film about once a year), but I really think he should have let us take the message home ourselves, rather than dishing it out in stark terms.I liked this film, and I recommend it as a home viewing because it is classic Woody Allen. He plays here with time travel and gives no explanation of how it works – it is just the magic of Paris. And that is fine with me, and I think it will be fine with you as well.",7,1,3,3 July 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," An amazingly animated Sunday-morning cartoon serial.
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW: THE ADVENTURES OF TINTINMINI-REVIEW : An amazingly animated Sunday-morning cartoon serial.RATING : See it in theaters If you're under 12, otherwise wait for the instant download (Rating System: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the instant download,' 'Don't waste your time')Tintin is a youthful reporter with lots of street cred. He purchases a replica of 'The Unicorn' - a 17th century schooner (with three masts, double decks, and 50 guns). No sooner does he get it home when bad things begin happening. Someone steals the ship from his flat. Then they come back and ransack his rooms. Then a man comes to his door to warn him of impending danger, and the man is gunned down by machine gun fire. But before the man expires, he spells out a clue on a nearby newspaper in his own blood. Tintin deciphers the clue as a remote city in the Middle East. But before he can follow up on the clue, he is abducted and taken prisoner on a cargo ship. And we're off'The Adventures of Tintin' is the big-screen version of a series of comic books published from 1907-1983. Stephen Spielberg helms this recreation and his talents are evident on the screen. In many ways, the movie resembles an Indiana Jones adventure: it is set in the same time frame (the 1940s) and there are a number of thrilling chase and fight scenes.The feature is animated with the same technology that brought us 'Polar Express.' However, a lot of the technical problems have been solved. The eyes in 'Polar Express' were creepy as they didn't seem to track correctly and gave a sort of vacant zombie-like presentation. This problem has been solved exceedingly well in 'Tintin.' Not only does Tintin's eyes move in the direction you expect them to, you can see Tintin focus on a bit of writing and watch his eyes move subtly from left to write as he reads.Also, the hair and skin in this feature is so realistic that at times you think you're looking at real people. This is especially true of Tintin's trademark shock of ginger hair. Tintin's dog Snowy stares down a Rottweiler whose features are so detailed that you might believe it was an actual dog and not computer graphic imagery. The humans were so realistic that only their cartoonish noses gave away the fact that they were rendered.While we're on the subject of CGI, the physics in this movie is uncanny. Feathers float, people and objects in the water bob. In almost every situation in this film you would believe you were looking at real-life objects in real-world physical reactions. Almost – there is one chase scene that taxed the limits of the CGI physics and some things look unnatural. But you'll be willing to overlook it since it's an animation.So let's talk about the problems with this film. Firstly, if you've never read the comic books 'Tintin' is based upon you may be a bit lost. Tintin is introduced to us without any description of his age. He looks like he's about 12 but as a reporter has many credits (exposed through a pan-shot of his wall-adorned news clippings). He talks like a youngster, but fights like a prize fighter. In the early scenes, Tintin appears to be somewhat inept. His dog Snowy repeatedly finds the clues or saves his bacon. I began to think that this would be carried through the entire film. But no, Snowy becomes almost irrelevant, even an annoyance at certain points. So, Tintin's character is not well defined.Another problem with this film is the 'serial' feel to it. I felt as though we were looking at about 10 episodes of a series of cliffhangers. I have no doubt that Stephen Spielberg knows more about storytelling than I do, yet the concept of a clear goal for Tintin doesn't materialize until about halfway through the movie – and that caused me to feel bored at about the thirty-minute mark. Writer Steven Moffat (well-known for his work on the reboot of 'Dr. Who') seems to have been ham-strung by keeping true to the original comics.Finally, the target age of the audience was unclear to me. I didn't do any research on 'Tintin' before going to the film so I was expecting something that would appeal to all ages. The level of sophistication of the plot and dialog was reminiscent of the old 'Hardy Boys' mysteries. I asked a young man of about 12 years what he thought of the film and he was enthusiastic about it and wanted to see more. He especially like the swashbuckling sword fights. However, while my date enjoyed the film, we agreed that is seemed to lack a certain maturity that would appeal to adults. In an age where Disney and Pixar films are constructed to appeal to both adults and children, it is a definite negative that it was designed to appeal to only children. The film was produced in association with Nickelodeon which leads me to wonder if a 'Tintin' animated series is in our future.So, if you're a young person who likes adventure, or an adult who loves the original comic book, you need to see this in theaters in 3D. But if you're not, you might want to catch this in the summer on instant download to enjoy the animation. And if you are not that much into the leading, bleeding edge of computer animation, don't waste your time.",4,2,6,25 December 2011
Horrible Bosses," The Three Stooges meet Hitchcock in the 21st century
","ONE LINE REVIEW : The Three Stooges meet Hitchcock in the 21st century.RATING : Wait for the Instant Download (Ratings: 'See it in the theater', 'Wait for the Instant Download', 'Don't Bother')NO SPOILERSI went into 'Horrible Bosses' with low expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. Horrible Bosses was funny and included a number of unexpected plot twists. Still, I don't see any reason to rush out to see it in theaters, so I recommend you 'Wait for the instant download'.The story is all about three guys (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) have horrible bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Ferrill). Batemen's boss cheats him out of a promotion. Sudeikis' boss dies and his coke-head son takes over. And Charlie Day has the enviable problem of Jennifer Anniston's sexual advances. The boys decide the best thing to do is kill their bosses and pay M.F. Jones (Jamie Foxx) to give them assassin advice. And the boys go off on their journey to free themselves from their demons.This plot could have come right out of a Three Stooges movie. In fact, the boys fumble and stumble and slap each other in classic style. What has changed is an update for modern times. They deal with felons, drug abusers, and gratuitous sex. And it's as much fun as a barrel of monkeys.The film has no serious weaknesses except that it is a bit slow in the middle. Kevin Spacey is a great villain boss. Jennifer Anniston evokes her same sexy image with an upgrade to sexual predator. And Colin Ferrel delivers a believable jerk boss.There are points when we think we know what will come next. And sometimes the film is a bit predictable. But there are a number of unexpected twists that make the movie lively and worth the time spent.",8,0,0,9 July 2011
Underworld Awakening," A train wreck of barely connectible scenes
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : UNDERWORLD : AWAKENINGMINI REVIEW : A train wreck of barely connectible scenesRATING : Don't waste your money (Rating System: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the instant download,' 'Don't waste your money')Kate Beckinsale is back as Selene. She's been frozen for 12 years and when she awakes she finds she has a daughter. But not just any daughter, she's the daughter Selene had with Michael Corvine (the hybrid Lycan/Vampire). So that makes her a special non-bitten hybrid – and the Lycans want to capture her.The whole movie is a chase scene with the daughter (who looks a lot like Regan in 'The Exorcist') alternately getting nabbed or saved.There is nothing interesting in this movie except for Beckinsale in tight PVC clothing (I often joke that the movie should be called 'Underwear'). The fight scenes are choppy and unwatchable (I'm forever ruined by the amazing fight scenes from 'The Matrix'). The plot is boring and unwatchable. The characters are empty and unwatchable. Do you see a trend here?I would say 'Awakening' has put a wooden stake in the heart of an otherwise fine franchise. So, for an unwatchable, unremarkable, retread of a trilogy that should have stayed a trilogy, I recommend you don't waste your money.",4,9,17,1 February 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Utilitarian use of CGI and thoughtful story make this a don't miss movie
","ONE LINE REVIEW : Utilitarian use of CGI and thoughtful story make this a don't miss movie RATING : See it in theaters (Rating scale : 'See it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time')NO SPOILERSSteve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 98-pound weakling who wants nothing more than to kick some Nazi butt. He goes to every recruiting station in Brooklyn to get accepted and keeps getting turned down. On top of that, he is the neighborhood punching bag, constantly getting into scrapes with bullies bigger than him. And that is what drives Steve - he hates bullies and there are no bullies bigger than the Nazis.He finally happens upon a special recruiting drive where a scientist (Stanley Tucci) is looking for someone with Steve's kind of guts. But tough-as-nails Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) is more than dubious and runs Steve ragged in basic training. But Steve's kind heart and determination make him the perfect personality for an injection that turns him into a super-strong Captain America.It turns out that the Nazis aren't the biggest bullies on the block. No, it's Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who is just using the Nazi platform as a way of taking over the world. All the players are set and we're off as Captain America goes into battle with the forces of evil.This movie is the beginning of the Avengers series and we're no doubt going to see more of the classic Avengers from Marvel comics in coming years.It is set in the 1940's during the second world war and the costuming and period sets are excellent. I really felt drawn into this world. However it's a sort of bizarro world where Nazis really don't show up that much and Red Skull's 'Hydra' forces are everywhere.And speaking of Red Skull - Hugo Weaving is amazing. Not just for his delivery and persona. But for being the best actor behind a mask since Michael Keeton's Batman. Weaving was the man behind the mask in 'V for Vendetta' where he delivered the entire movie wearing a Guy Faulks mask. Here, he uses his flesh-and-blood face for the first third of the film and then pulls that off to reveal his Red Skull face. And still delivers a flawless intensity that he has brought to every other role he's plays since Agent Smith in 'The Matrix'. The man can do no wrong.Chris Evans starts out the movie looking very frail and sickly. But once he undergoes the special treatment, he is one buff dude. I haven't spent any time trying to puzzle out the CGI magic that makes this possible, but it is impressive. I'd swear there were two actors in the role. Otherwise Evans is a pretty bland character. But he has all the golly-gee-whiz Mom-and-apple pie look and delivery that makes Captain America believable.I said of 'Green Lantern' that is was the perfect super-hero movie. I may have to take that back, because Captain America raised the bar higher. The writers took their time building the character of feeble- Steve. Then they took their time building the character of buff- Steve/Captain America. All the while defining the evil villain, creating relationships between Steve and love interest Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and Colonel Phillips, and buddy 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Unfortunately, they spent little time defining the relationships between Cap'n America and his team - but hey - it's only a 2-hour movie.The pacing was quite steady. I never felt bored and I never felt overwhelmed with last-minute plot devices. Except for one - Red Skull has this amazing technology and they really didn't explain where it came from (other than a reference at the beginning of the film where Weaving's character finds a glowing cube in some Egyptian ruins). The movie has a sort of steam-punk feel to it that I enjoyed.So, for it's big effects - used in just the right amount. And a story well-told, taking the time to tell it well, I gave Captain America a rating of 'See it in the theaters'.BTW: I saw it in 3-d which some reviewers have complained results in dark images. I enjoyed it in Real-3D and found the light levels to be just fine.",Null,26,42,29 July 2011
Hugo," Never was there a more beautiful movie
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : HUGUMINI-REVIEW : Never was there a more beautiful movieRATING : See it in theaters and in 3D (Rating System: 'See it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time')Hugo (Asa Butterfield, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas') is an orphan living in a Paris railway station in 1938. His father was a museum curator and watchmaker. Before his death, Hugo's father had found an automaton (mechanical man) which he and Hugo were attempting to fix. By night, Hugo keeps the clocks in the railway station running. Hugo steals parts from a toymaker (Ben Kingsley) who catches on to Hugo and mentors him. The toymaker is godfather to young orphan Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz, 'Kick-Ass') who befriends Hugo and insists on seeing his home. Hugo agrees and shows her the automaton and together they get it to work. The first thing it draws is a picture from a movie that Hugo used to watch with his father. And we're off. . .This is without a doubt the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Every detail of this film has been made with the utmost care and love. Even the snowflakes are amazing. I saw it in 3D and it is the first 3D movie I have seen that uses 3D artistically, not as a gimmick. There are scenes where the camera runs us through a crowd, and we feel as if we are there, brushing past bystanders. The sets look and sound real. The clockworks within the tower clock and automaton are as real as any wind up clock you know. If director Martin Scorsese had intended to create a masterpiece, then he has succeeded.The children (Butterfield, Moretz) are heartbreakingly beautiful. They give performances that exude the innocence of youth and a constant sense of urgency. Butterfield in particular plays Hugo as a tortured youngster with a passion for fixing things. In Hollywood movies it is so easy to play young people as wise beyond their years and / or smart- alecky. Instead, these children are three-dimensional with purpose and wonder.It turns out that this film is not so much the story of an orphan boy, but a wonderful homage to one of film's great pioneers. We get a retrospective of the early days of film and a film history lesson without even knowing it. Scorsese takes up the gauntlet of film innovators who came before and makes his mark in film history by crafting a 3-D movie others will aspire to match. This is clearly an Academy Award winner and instant classic.So for wonderful acting, amazing effects, beautiful set design, creative storytelling, and a loving tribute to a historical film legend, you must 'see it in the theater.'",10,4,9,2 December 2011
Warrior," Cain and Able meet Rocky
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : WARRIORONE LINE REVIEW : Cain and Able meet RockyRATING : See it in theaters. (rating system: 'see it in theaters', 'wait for the instant download', 'don't waste your time')SPOILER FREETommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former marine who has returned home to ask his father Paddy (Nick Nolte) to help train him for the upcoming Spartan Mixed-Martial-Artist fighting match. It's a single elimination brawl between 16 fighters.Meanwhile, Tommy's estranged brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is facing bankruptcy and foreclosure. And to make matters worse, he is fired from his teaching job for moonlighting as a competitive fighter. Brendan enters into the Spartan competition despite his wife's opposition.But there is friction in the Colonder family. Paddy was a lousy father and a drunk which forced Tommy to leave home with his mother. The mother died when Tommy was just 16, so he is only talking to his father so that he can get the training he used to get from him as a kid. Meanwhile, Brendan has disavowed his father and will not talk to him.The characters are all in play... And we're off.I really enjoyed this film. If you're a UCF fan you will enjoy it. However, the fight scenes leave a bit to be desired. There are frequent cutaways and people walking through the shots. No doubt this is due to the fact that the actors did not do a lot of the fighting . Compare this to 'Rocky' where Sylvester Stallone and his actors were actually boxing in his movie.But it's not all blood and punches. The pain in the hearts of the two brothers is evident in fine performances by Hardy and Edgerton. Nick Nolte as the recovering alcoholic father is believable and tortured. I was happy to see Jennifer Morrison ('House') as the wife in a more complicated role than we've seen in the past (although most of her scenes were underlit).I did walk away with one nagging question ... Who is the Warrior in this film?So, for great fight Scenes intercut with some sightly meaty relationships, I recommend you 'see it in the theater.'",Null,0,4,10 September 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Sex, violence, and a great mystery
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOOMINI-REVIEW : Sex, violence, and a great mysteryRATING : Wait for the instant download (Rating System: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the instant download,' 'Don't waste your time')Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig, 'Cowboys and Aliens') is a journalist for the independent London magazine 'Millennium.' He has just lost a libel case where he exposed a Madoff-like villain, but could not prove his facts without revealing his sources. He is about to lose his life savings and his magazine.Meanwhile, Swedish multimillionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plumber, 'Priest') has hired a leather-clad, pierced, tattooed young woman (Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara, 'The Social Network') to investigate Blomkvist using her internet uber-hacking-powers. Vanger has a mystery he needs solving: His niece has gone missing and presumed dead for forty years. However, he receives an anonymous gift from her that only she would send. He wants Blomkvist to find out who is sending the gifts.But Blomkvist cannot do it alone; he needs the help of the very person who did his background investigation - Lisbeth. Now, it is up to him and his unlikely companion to uncover the coldest of cold cases. And we're offI've never read the 800-page tome (by Stieg Larson) that inspired this movie, but I did see the original Scandinavian version. The Hollywood version is every bit as good as the original, and then some. The first difference is the amazingly complicated and detailed CGI opening credits. I felt as though I was watching a Bond movie intro. The other big difference is the longish aftermath. The ending goes into a good bit of detail about what happens to our characters after the thrilling climax. I have to say I enjoyed both additions. I do have one complaint: The original film made Lisbeth appear to be the aggressor in her relationship with Blomkvist. She even appears to have manipulated him. This new version has changed that relationship. I preferred the original ending. Sadly, I cannot say which is more true to Larson's novel.The plot had the potential to be incredibly complex. It involved at least a dozen members of Vanger's family. On top of that we had to constantly switch between 1960's Vanger-family and current-day Vanger- family. However, the director (David Fincher, 'The Social Network') had Blomkvist post a family tree on his cabin wall with pictures of old- family and current-family. It was a very nice device which allowed the audience to keep all the players straight.I have heard that some people thought the depiction of sexual violence was gratuitous. The rape scenes were not easy to watch. However, they were certainly no worse than the original Scandinavian version. I think there is no good way to portray rape. Panning to curtains blowing in an open window doesn't do justice to the violation of the victim. Whereas showing the details of the act may, by some, be seen as titillating. I felt that the director had the balance right. It was clear our victim was being hurt in a most personal way, without exploiting the act for entertainment. This was most clearly demonstrated as we saw the victim in the shower later that night with cuts and bruises over a third of her body. If any movie-goer experienced voyeuristic pleasure in the rape scene, then it should have been snuffed-out by the shower scene.The movie clocked-in at about 2 hours and 40 minutes. And while it was longer than most movies, it didn't disappoint. The mystery, action, and unfolding lives of the protagonists made the time slip by. However, there is no good reason to rush out and see this movie in the theaters. In fact, it is a good one to curl up on the sofa with someone you find dear. So, for a good retelling of a now-classic tale, but a bit on the longish side, I recommend you wait for the instant download.",8,1,5,9 January 2012
Bad Teacher," Camron Diaz is still Hot
","ONE LINE REVIEW: Camraon Diaz is still hot.RATING: Wait for the Instant Download, if you like Camron Diaz. Otherwise, Don't waste your time. (Ratings: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the Instant Download,' 'Don't waste your time')DANGER : SPOILERS (but no surprises)'Bad Teacher' features Camron Diaz as Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher of some ill repute who just lost her sugar daddy fiancé and is trolling for her next victim. She finds him in Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is a substitute teacher with well-to-do family connections. But getting in her way is goody-two-shoes teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) who has attracted his attentions. Elizabeth decides that to win the man over she needs breast augmentation surgery (costing $10,000) and will do whatever it takes to get the money. Meanwhile PE teacher Russell Getis (Jason Segel) has the hots for Elizabeth. And our little love triangles are complete.The basic premise of this movie is that Elizabeth Halsey is cool, and everyone else is a dork. Elizabeth smokes pot, and drinks, and lures men to their fate with her sex appeal.No, that's not true. That's the secondary premise of this movie. The basic premise of this movie is that Camron Diaz is still hot. And to prove it she was shot from every possible angle that you can shoot an actor. Long shots, two shots, sexual dry humping shots, and extreme close ups. She looked great in every scene. There is also a very seductive car wash scene.I think it takes a lot of balls to title a move with the word 'Bad' in it. The reviews almost write themselves 'Bad Teacher is bad news. Badly Directed, Badly acted... blah blah blah' The fact is that 'Bad Teacher' is okay entertainment. This film is pretty juvenile in places and includes plenty of gross-out and fart humor. The best lines are already in the trailers.Elizabeth does a lot of bad things including seducing the head of the Illinois state testing organization to steal the answers to their standardized test. This enables her to 'teach to the test' and win a cash award that allows her to get her boob-job. But don't worry, she never does.If this plot device of teaching the students to cheat sounds familiar, you are probably a South Park fan. See season 12, episode 5, 'Eek, A Penis!'The problem with this movie is that Elizabeth has no redeeming characteristics. She is so bad that we wonder why we care about her. But the film pulls it off because Camron Diaz is still hot. Also, every other character in the film is a dork, making her look exceedingly cool. Amy Squirrel (a sort of female Frank Burns) attempts to get Elizabeth fired and in so doing gets arrested herself. But she fails miserably in no small measure because Camron Diaz is still hot.Justin Timberlake does a good job of playing off-type as the dorky innocent substitute teacher. I liked Timberlake in 'The Social Network' and here. He's not afraid of making fun of himself both in this film and in his occasional SNL appearances.In the end, this is a Hollywood feature and so the dorky PE teacher gets the hot bad girl in the end (no pun intended). And the transition of Elizabeth from superficial gold-digger to warm, caring gold-digger happens overnight and with relatively little on-screen impetus. But it's OK because Camron Diaz is still hot.",4,1,4,25 June 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The most amazing on-location sights; the most incomprehensible plot.
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (4) : GHOST PROTOCOLMINI-REVIEW : The most amazing on-location sights; the most incomprehensible plot.RATING : Don't waste your time – unless you love IMAX (Rating System: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the instant download,' 'Don't waste your time')Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise) is back and he's in big trouble. His mission went badly and evil enemy Cobalt/Hendriks (Michael Nyqvist) has the codes to fire the Russian missiles. Cobalt wants to start World War Three because well, he's crazy like that. Hawke and the entire IMF have been disavowed because they were framed for blowing up the Kremlin. Now it's up to Hawke and his renegade team (Beautiful femme fatale Jane (Paula Patton), techno geek Benji (Simon Pegg), and rugged analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner)) to set things right. And we're off . . .There is so much wrong with this film it is hard to pick a starting point. Let me start by saying that I don't understand why this is a Christmas film. This is an action adventure that is great popcorn fare and appeals to the Transformers crowd. Usually such films come out in the summer and are gone with the first whiffs of the fall.The plot is completely incomprehensible. Suffice it to say, Hawke and his team flail from one blunder to the next. However, this is a plot device that allows the movie to travel to exotic locations and exploit the IMAX camera (see below). And everywhere they go, there are chase scenes. Because, well, Tom Cruise looks good running.And for the special effects and plot devices, I feel as though we've seen all of them in other Mission Impossible films. There's Tom Cruise blown across the screen by explosions. Tom Cruise barely escaping flying automobiles, and (this time) Jeremy Renner hovering above the floor of a computer facility while he manages tricky computer magic. There was even a 'Red light, Blue light' moment reminiscent of the first film.The film weighs in at 2 hours and 15 minutes – a bit long by Hollywood standards. I saw plenty of places where scenes could have been trimmed and a few that could have been completely eliminated as they didn't further the plot – but were cute bits of special effects.And while we're talking about cute – a lot of the dialog was just adorable. That is to say, there were jokes interspersed that were supposed to lighten the tension and humanize the characters (especially with comedian Pegg). But they fell flat as they were largely forced humor and not well-placed in the film.I get the feeling this was supposed to be some sort of 'reboot' for the Mission Impossible franchise. Tom Cruise and JJ Abrams were producers. You may recall that JJ Abrams is the head of 'Bad Robot' productions and he directed the reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009.The one saving grace of this film is the on-location filming. I saw MI4 in IMAX and it was spectacular. We start off in Russia with wonderful shots of the Kremlin. Then we are whisked away to Dubai where Tom Cruise does amazing feats of wall crawling in front of IMAX cameras. If you have ever been to IMAX and seen the panoramic views that take your breath away, you can appreciate how impressive Tom Cruise hanging from a thread at the top of the tallest building in the world can be. It successfully engaged my vertigo. Then we are off to India for more adventure and wonderful sights.I paid $16.50 in my theater to see this film and I balked. To be sure, it was not worth the price. The 30 minutes of IMAX views, while wonderful, are not enough to warrant a recommendation. If you want to get the full IMAX experience go see 'IMAX: To Fly!' or some other IMAX offering. But there is absolutely no way you should spend even $5 to rent the instant download. So, for a meandering, incomprehensible plot and rehashed devices, I suggest you 'don't waste your time.'",5,7,18,17 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Sedate treatment with no message.
","RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APESONE LINE REVIEW: Sedate treatment with no message.RATING: Don't waste your time. (rating system: 'see it in theaters', 'wait for the instant download', 'don't waste your time')NO SPOILERSWill Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease. His experiments prove successful on a chimpanzee whose intelligence is increased by orders of magnitude. However, a last-minute outburst by his prize subject results in the chimp's death and the termination of Rodman's research. The chimp had given birth to a child named Caesar (Andy Serkis of Gollum fame) who inherited the super-intelligence.Rodman raises Caesar in his attic. But while the animal has human-like intelligence, it has ape-like strength and a child's naiveté. When a neighbor has an altercation with Rodman's Alzheimer-stricken father (John Lithgow), Caesar comes to his defense and injures the neighbor. The police come and Caesar is locked away in the local  chimp jail (I think it was a zoo, but it was never made clear). Now that all the players are in play, we're off and running.'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a remake of the classic 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' (1972). 'Conquest' had strong moral themes: slavery, man's inhumanity towards man, man's inhumanity as exhibited through his mistreatment of animals. 'Rise' has no such high aspirations. In fact, 'Rise' appears to have no aspirations whatsoever.From a story-telling point of view, it's not really clear who the hero of the story is. It starts out looking like the story of Will Rodman and his goals of finding a cure for Alzheimer's. There is a sub-plot involving the Lithgow character and how he fades in and out of awareness and ultimately death. But it is so lightly treated that it could have been completely written out of the script. There is a love interest for Rodman (the lovely Frieda Pinto), but she could just as easily not have been in the movie at all. It isn't until well into the second act that it is clear our focus is to be on Caesar.Taken as an Action/Adventure movie, 'Rise' falls down again. There are occasional events where apes run amok, but except for the climax, no one ever gets hurt in the film. There are scenes where humans are rude to the apes, but never really harm them. I blame this on the PG-13 rating. It appears this movie was made for younger children and not adults. There is very little action in the movie and what little there is, is so tame as to be boring. The special effects are quite good. Andy Serkis has carved out a one- man niche for green-screen acting. Caesar and the other CGI apes are very believable, complete with very human facial expressions. But still, at times, you can see through the CGI and see the animation. I'm sure in a few years these artifacts will be resolved and actors, even Serkis-animal (sic) actors, will become unnecessary.There are a number of curiosities in the movie. Rodman talks to Caesar in English, but Caesar has to use sign language to talk to Rodman. I guess the assumption is that Caesar is smart enough to understand the spoken word but has no vocal ability. Other annoyances were heavy- handed homages to the 1968 'Planet of the Apes' in the form of one- liners from the film and film clips used on the incidental television screens. It was cheesy and overdone.The movie plodded along at amazingly slow pace. With a running time of 110 minutes (precisely the average movie duration) there was so much that could have been dropped out or edited for time. With no action, slow pacing, dull plot, and uneven use of good actors, I recommend you don't waste your time.",Null,1,3,12 August 2011

","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : DRIVEONE-LINE REVIEW : Robot Zombie Ryan Gosling sleepwalks through snooze fest.RATING : Don't Waste Your Money (Rating Scale: 'See it in the theater,' 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time.')A Hollywood stunt driver (Driver, Ryan Gosling) works as a mechanic by day and dabbles in getaway car action by night. He lives down the hall from very cute Irene (Carey Mulligan). She has an adorable son Benicio (Kaden Leos) who is befriended by Driver and Driver takes a keen interest in Irene as well. However, Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from jail and is being forced to rob a pawn shop to repay protection money from when he was in the slammer.Meanwhile, back at the auto shop: Driver's boss is hapless shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who goes into business with local mob boss Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and partner mob boss Nino (Ron Perlman). They want to employ Driver to race cars and make legitimate money.Driver decides to help Standard and so becomes intwined in a twisted tale of bad guys and badder guys. And we're off...I am always nervous when the title credits for a movie are in fluorescent pink. I believe 'Cocktail' with Tom Cruise set the standard for me. And the harbinger of bad flicks still works as this movie was the dullest movie I've sat through, ever.I saw Ryan Gosling for the first time in 'Crazy Stupid Love.' I guess he's some sort of heart-throb. I liked him in that movie as a sleazy lounge lizard who has a change of heart. However, the actor that performed that part was nowhere to be seen in 'Drive.' In fact, his performance was so bland anyone, even a cardboard cutout could have played the role. He literally never blinks an eye in this film. He never displays much more than the slighted bit of emotion.And for a movie about a stunt driver, and named 'Drive' for that matter, there is a shocking lack of automobile action. The movie opens with a car chase of sorts that never gets over 35 MPH. I've seen more car action in children's movies than in this.I believe director Nicolas Winding Refn and writer Hossein Amini were shooting for something like 'Taxi Driver.' There, the lead was a complex character with delusions of grandeur. Driver is no such complex beast. He is as emotionless when driving as when kissing and killing.This is such a non-movie with no substantial roles for any player in it that I recommend you 'Don't waste your time.'",3,56,116,16 September 2011
Super 8," It's E.T. on steroids
","ONE LINE REVIEW: It's 'E.T.' on steroids.RATING: See it in theaters(Rating: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the Instant Download,' 'Don't waste your time')DANGER : SPOILERS WITHINI didn't quite know what to expect from 'Super 8.' The running joke is that it's a movie about a low-cost motel. But in fact, it's a coming of age movie about teens who make zombie movies in the late 70s (or is it early 80s - the sound track was a bit confusing). Think 'E.T.' meets 'Stand By Me'.JJ Abrams is the writer/director. He's the guy who brought us 'Alias' and 'Lost' not to mention the new 'Star Trek' reboot. (In that last movie he shows off his love for unassociated glare - which he has tamed in this movie). I once saw a TED video where Abrams lectures about the secret to his success: The Magic Box. When he was a kid, he loved to go to the magic store and buy magic tricks. The one thing he really wanted was the magic box - a box filled with unknown magic tricks. Abrams later learned that the owner would take old, non-selling objects off the shelves and put them in the box and sell them at cost. So, there could be anything in there.Abrams bought one of these boxes and never opened it. He brought it on- stage to show to the audience. He said that he learned the secret of suspense from the magic box. To keep someone interested in whatever it is that you're doing, just create a secret, put it in the box, and then not open the box until the last minute.If you watched 'Lost' you can see that play out. There were a lot of secrets in that show right up to the end. And he certainly made us wait. This is also why it can be unclear what this film is about from the ads. Abrams didn't want anyone to spoil the experience in the trailers.In Super 8 you can see that philosophy play out again. The whole movie revolves around this secret that is on the train. The boys in the film discover the secret because they were filming near the train and accidentally captured it on Super-8 film. The rest of the movie is all about them trying to convince their deputy-sheriff dad that something is amiss.Well, it isn't ALL about the secret. There's a girl and two buddies who both like her (I mean, like-like, you know). And there is romantic tension. This is the coming-of-age part of the story. If you were a fan of 'Lost' you'll see some familiar themes. There's a lot of unspecified magnetism. And a lot of stuff being thrown in the air by unseen monsters. And people inexplicably going missing. And dogs running away.And if you're a fan of any science fiction movie from about any era, you'll see the evil government agents doing unspecified unspeakable things to apparently innocent monsters.The plot resolves unevenly. People reconcile their differences with little more than a sentence to bind them. The monster doesn't or does eat people and if it does then it is unclear why it hangs on to them. There's a lot of confusion around the ending. But if you don't think too much it won't bother you much.I gave this a 'See it in theaters' because Abrams does a good job of entertaining us along the way, and the special effects are good popcorn theater. You'll want to see it on the big screen to get the most of it.Generally I like Abrams' work and I liked this film as Summer entertainment. But he's not quite a Spielberg yet (who was the producer). He borrowed a lot from Spielberg's bag of tricks (slowly zooming on on three kids while the wind blows the hair about their faces, for one). As a writer I think the tries to accomplish too much in one film. The film ran about 2hours 20 minutes and he left a few things dangling and resolved too much too quickly. I think he could have left out a couple subplots and told a more endearing story.",7,0,1,22 June 2011
In Time," It had a lot of unrealized potential.
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW - IN TIMEMINI-REVIEW : It had a lot of unrealized potential.RATING : Don't waste your 'Time' (Rating System : 'See it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time')Spoilers INSIDEWill Salas (Justin Timberlake 'Bad Teacher') lives in the not-to-distant future where people are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 years. At that time a green-glowing clock on their arms starts counting down Time - and when the Time gets to zero, you die. To get more Time you have to work in the factories. There is a wide gap between those who live day-to-day, earning just enough Time to get by, and those who live with thousands, even millions of years.Will saves a man from getting killed because he is in the wrong part of town (Time zone) with too much 'Time on his hands' (the movie is rife with these time-based clichés). The man, however, is really 150 years old and is ready to die. He gives his 105 remaining Tiime to will, and then publicly dies as his Time runs out. But not before revealing to Will that there is, in fact, plenty of Time to go around, if only those in high places would allow it.The next day, Will's mother (Olivia Wilde 'House') dies because her time runs out. This fills Will with a great resolve and he heads to the upper echelons of his world to find out how to set things right. He meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried 'Red Riding Hood') who is the daughter of Time-millionaire Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser 'Mad Men'). Will kidnaps Sylvia and is then chased by Time-Keeper Leon (Cillian Murphy 'Tron: Legacy'). And we're off...This movie starts out really strong and fritters away its opening, petering out into a confused ending. The concept of everyone aging only to 25 years is interesting. It also makes for a showcase of Hollywood's youngest and most exciting actors. The fact that people are constantly Timing-out makes for constant excitement as you have a multitude of 'ticking clocks' running - so there should be lots of tension. And yet, the move drags awkwardly in several places. This movie seems like someone's great idea that simply didn't get thought through to completion.(In fact, it could be someone else's idea as Harlen Ellison filed suit to have the movie held from release as it is similar to his short-story, ''Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman' which concerns a dystopian future in which people have a set amount of time to live which can be revoked by a Timekeeper.)The movie quickly devolves into a sort of 'Bonnie and Clyde' story as Will and Amanda rip off Time-banks and give away the Time to the 'poor'. It's unclear exactly what Will's goal is in this film. He seems to want to have everyone share the wealth, and at the same time wants to destabilize the 'system'. But it isn't clear what the result of this stabilization would be and whether it is any better than the world he lives in.All of this comes at a time in our history when the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' have never been wider. The movie paints the 'haves' as oblivious and evil greedy meanies. They are so evil that they are non-characters. Rather, just cardboard cut-outs that are easy to take shots at. The movie seems to want to say that if the fat cats would just share, then everyone would be better off.But the movie doesn't offer this reward. Instead, the result of all this Robin-Hood-like behavior is a rise in the cost of living. So the poor- cum-rich are now the poor again. There are even allusions to a reverse- Atlas-Shrugged as the workers stop working in the factories. Again, the results of this are not shared. If 'In Time' was trying to make any sort of social commentary, it failed utterly.The movie is nice to look at. Lots of pretty faces and taut bodies. Everyone seems to run everywhere in this universe. Will takes his shirt off and puts it on a lot. Amanda has nice bras to show off. The cars are cool yet understated. The green-glowing numbers are a cool effect. And yet, without a strong plot and a coherent set of goals for our heroes, I can only recommend you 'Don't waste your Time'.",Null,4,10,29 October 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A confusing ending to an epic tale.
","ONE LINE REVIEW : A confusing ending to an epic tale.RATING : See it in theaters(Rating scale : 'See it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time')NO SPOILERSIn this final chapter to the Harry Potter series, Harry (Daniel Radcliff), Harmione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) must find the three Horcrux's and destroy them to prevent Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) from becoming immortal.The biggest problem with this film is that you must have read the book in order to understand what is going on. I haven't. I've seen all the films up to this point and I had a hard time knowing what was happening.The story starts out with Harry, Harmione, and Ron burying Dobby, the elf. They then interview a goblin who sort of fills us in on all the events leading up to this point. Then they interview a wand maker to tells us who is good and bad in this film. And we're off. Except we aren't. The trio then travel around the Potter Universe to try and find three Horcrux's (a term never explained but are magical items that link to Voldermort's immortality). As they find each one they destroy it.I am trying to write a review without exposing any of the plot points. But it's hard. Because to explain to you just what is wrong with this film I'd have to give away key elements.I believe that any film must stand on its own. You shouldn't have to have seen the previous film to understand it and you shouldn't have to have read the book. 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' fails in both cases. The film meanders around the Potter Universe finding objects and destroying them. The biggest confusion on my part is why must they destroy all three of these 'Horcrux's'? If Voldermort needs all of them to 'regenerate' then why not just destroy one? If he doesn't need all of them then why doesn't he regenerate with the one he already has?The ending is equally confusing and you'll see why when you see the film. But basically I don't understand what it is to die in the Potter Universe. Apparently it is optional.We are never let in on the details of what is necessary to kill Voldermort. And the wand he stole from Dumbeldor's grave has some very fluid rules as to who owns it at any particular time.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is everything I hate about fantasy fiction. There are no rules. The writer makes them up as they go along to serve whatever is necessary to extricate the hero from whatever corner the writer has painted him into. I have seen fantasy done well (Lord of the Rings, eg) and Harry Potter is not fantasy done well.Still the visual effects are stunning and you may never get another chance to see the movie on the big screen. That is why I recommend you 'See it in the Theater.' Not because it is a great story, but because (despite its many flaws) it is a treat for the eyes.",Null,2,3,16 July 2011
50_50," It's not The Hangover with Cancer – it's more.
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : 50/50MINI REVIEW : It's not The Hangover with Cancer – it's more.RATING : See it in theaters (Rating System: 'See it in theaters', 'Wait for the instant download', 'Don't waste your time')Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt – 'Third Rock from the Sun', '10 Things I hate about you') works for a public radio station. His girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard – 'The Help' & daughter to Ron Howard) is a self- absorbed abstract artist. When Adam is diagnosed with spinal cancer, she puts on a show of caring, but is otherwise distracted. Adam's best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen – 'Pinapple Express', 'Knocked Up') takes a different view of his buddy's situation – it's babe candy.Adam goes to neophyte psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick – 'Twilight', 'Scott Pilgrim') for counseling. She is awkward and inexperienced but earnest in her concern for Adam. Adam is also smothered by his doting mother (Anjelica Huston – 'The Postman Always Rings Twice') who is caring for his father (Serge Houde). The stage is set and we're off The previews for this movie make it look like 'The Hangover' but with cancer. But it is more. It's a true-life-inspired story about a young man (Adam) who is facing life-threatening cancer. It's approached with a sense of humor and sensitivity. We meet Adam, who is just getting started in life. He eats right, obeys all the rules (he doesn't even cross against a street light despite there being no traffic), and still receives the devastating news that he could die from cancer. The irony is he never learned to drive because it is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States.Adam is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a very straight manner. We learn that he is a very giving, even forgiving man. Perhaps too much so as he has become a doormat for all the women in his life.His best friend, Kyle, is played by Seth Rogen who is the obvious comic relief. Kyle seems to be an odds maker and when he learns that Adam's chances of Kyle can think of nothing more than getting laid and sees Adam's cancer as a way of improving their odds. Both actors bring an honesty to their roles that is palpable. The film is less about cancer and more about how people respond to responsibility. We see the girlfriend who just goes through the motions. The mother who (already overwhelmed with taking care of her Alzheimer's husband) wants to move in. The best friend who relates to his buddy the only way he knows how – to get laid.For a heartwarming story, told with sympathy and humor, I recommend you 'see it in theaters.'",Null,0,1,10 October 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Best of the three, but still bad.
","ONE LINE REVIEW: Best of the three, but still bad. RATING: Don't waste your time. (Ratings: 'See it in theaters,' 'Wait for the Instant Download,' 'Don't waste your time')NO SPOILERSI actually saw the first Transformers movie a couple days ago on Netflix. It was bearable. I saw the second film two years ago and it was terrible - the fight scenes looked like a tornado hit a scrap yard. Michael Bay appears to have learned from his mistakes and created a somewhat watchable movie this time out.The movie revolves around young Sam Witwicki (Shia LaBeouf) who is friends with the good robots (Autobots) and his girlfriend Carly (Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who is a stunning blonde (and replaced Mega Fox - see the Internet for details on how she got fired). The movie tries to be about relationships and really falls down on the job (with comic-relief from mom and dad (Kevin Dunn and Julie White)). And it tries to be about heroism. And it tries to be about saving the world. But in the end all it is really about is robot fight scenes.The subtitle of the film is 'Dark of the Moon' - but I bet it was supposed to be 'Dark Side of the Moon' but was changed so as not to affiliate itself with the Pink Floyd album of the same name. It always surprises me when people talk about the dark side of the moon because there is no such thing. The Moon rotates on its axis same as does Earth. It's just that it is locked in a gear-like orbit with us so only one side ever faces us. People think of this as the 'light' side when in fact it goes through light and dark phases just as the Earth does. More accurately, what people should say is the 'Far Side of the Moon'. But hey, who am I to complain?Michael Bay has hijacked some of America's greatest and most devastating moments to create a realistic feel to this film. And to his credit, he has succeeded. But I feel violated. He has retold perhaps the greatest achievement of humankind by turning the moon landing into an exploration of the moon for Decepticon (the bad robots) technology. He even enlisted the REAL Buzz Aldrin to play a cameo in which he tells the Autobots (the good robots, remember?) that all of Apollo was a covert mission to harvest robot bootie from the moon. My God! BUZZ ALDRIN! I hope they paid him a boat-load of money. I really do.And again, later, the Autobots leave Earth in a space shuttle - Discovery - only for it to be blown up before it reaches Earth orbit. For me this was too close to the events of Challenger and Columbia. It certainly looked very much like the real thing.And in the last quarter of the movie, the Decepticons attack Chicago - with scenes that look amazingly like the bombing of the Twin Towers.This is just artistic exploitation. I found it foul and manipulative. I don't have much else to say about that.Otherwise, the film was a virtual who's who of cameos and other talent. Leonard Nimoy voiced the sage Sentinal Prime robot (there were several asides to his role as 'Spock' in the original Star Trek as well). John Turturro as 'Simmons', the conspiracy theorist. Patrick Dempsey as the human bad guy. Frances McDermand as the government agent. John-FREAKIN- Malkovich (!) as the eccentric guy who had no business in this film but to give Sam a job. Ken Juong who played basically the same character he did in 'The Hangover'. Bill O'Reilly as himself. And Alan Tudyk ('Firefly', 'Serenity') as a German uber-cyber-guy.To his credit, Michael Bay succeeded in knitting all the robot fight scenes together with a plot. A flimsy plot, but it made some sort of sense if you didn't dwell on it. The movie had a fair amount of swearing in it and people being reduced to ash, so I was surprised it didn't merit a 'R' rating rather than 'PG-13'.I saw this movie in 3D. It was cool. But if you do see a movie in 3D, try to sit near the center of the theater. While all movie screens have a 'sweet spot' where the light is focused (and it is around the middle of the theater), 3D movies have this in spades. I sat on the left-most aisle of the theater and had a lot of parallax problems. Things on the far right were split as though I had crossed my eyes. So, please, sit near the middle/center of the theater if you pay an extra $4 for 3D. You'll thank me.Shia LaBeouf has said this is his last Transformers movie (actually, I read it was his last action/adventure role). Here's hoping that it's the last Transformers movie - period.",1,4,12,1 July 2011
