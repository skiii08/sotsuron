Casablanca," Very good movie
",This movie was very good I didn't know how I was going to like it since I've never really watched black and white films but I really got into it. The story line was good. The acting wasn't corny like other films around this time. After awhile you forget your watching a black and white movie. It might not seem that good at the beginning but don't just shut it off really watch it and trust me you will get into it. I didn't think I would but I did. This is a romantic film. The main guy is very much kept to himself he doesn't let himself get to close to anyone he has one best friend and that's it. Later on in the film it explains why he's like that but you got to watch the movie.,8,0,1,14 April 2011
