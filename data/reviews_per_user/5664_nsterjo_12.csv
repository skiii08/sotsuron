The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not the disappointment I was expecting...
","After seeing the previous movies and reading some reviews from here, I braced myself for experiencing another boring, cheesy and over the top romantic flop but was gladly disappointed. It was of course still a romantic movie whose strongest and main message is one of selfless love and sacrifice, but having read the books I knew what to expect and I was fine with that. What I am not fine with, is the fact that some people, can tolerate a romantic novel but seem hell-bent on stepping all over a romantic movie. It's very simple to me; you know what you like, go watch that. This isn't a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate it's message, will surely enjoy it and find fewer faults in it. I enjoyed this one better than all the previous ones; it went smoother, it didn't bore me more than it I could take and even the actors seemed to have taken a few acting classes since the last one. I almost believed K. Stewart as Bella this time around. Well, almost; I still think she was a poor choice of casting along with Taylor Lautner. I especially enjoyed the fact that the soundtrack from the first movie made a comeback in this one. I liked the original music. I'm more excited to be looking forward to seeing the finale after watching this one now; I know there's more to enjoy as this story comes to an end. A 9/10 from me just to wind up some people:-)",9,3,11,19 November 2011
Milk," Just another bio-flick.
","I recently saw a screener of this movie and was very excited about it cause I'm usually very fond of Sean Penn's work and very intrigued by Van Sant's to say the least.In general, I liked it. It has roughly everything a bio-flick is supposed to have and it tries to stay on the personal side of the story while it portrays the bigger issue which is that of the gay rights and freedom. Wheather it managed this I guess it's a matter of personal opinion and of what's more important to the individual viewer. Myself, although I'm totally for the equality of rights and freedom of individuals or groups, I wanted a little more personal touch and a deeper dig into Milk's life and character. It only felt like I didn't get to know him properly and understand why he did some or most of the things that he did even though I could see exactly where he was coming from, facing some of those same issues myself. This obviously is a shortcoming of the script or the final editing which might have left out many things. Still, the story in general feels almost complete and acceptable. It managed to touch me deeply and even make me cry by the end.In relation to the acting, I don't think there's anything to complain about. Everyone was very good or even better than good, but I wouldn't start handing out Oscars just yet. Sean Penn was very good but to be honest he did nothing that we haven't seen yet. It seems to me that this role was a very obvious attempt to land him another Academy Award or a nomination at least but I for once won't be convinced so easily. It has become like the latest craze to have straight actors play gay people and then applaud and award them for the 'magnificient performance' and the 'accurate and very real' portrayal of the faggot. But in my opinion that's the easiest part; everyone can play the faggot. How about having a real gay actor play Milk's role, or that of the boyfriend, or that of the other gay people in this movie? It irritates me that even Van Sant - a director who for years now has fabulously brought the gay world more out of the closet than anyone else, - falls prey to one of the biggest paradoxes out there, that of the Hollywood - maybe the most important and leading institute to proclaim and sustain gay rights and yet the most homophobic yet. Just ask yourselves, how many openly gay actors do you know that are still very successful and have a very high profiled career still going strong? Van Sant (or the production company) clearly and easily could have used (at least more) gay actors in this cast, but I guess that would turn it into a gay movie and of course it wouldn't sell.So please forgive me if I don't applaud Penn or Franco for their sincere acting, or nominate any of the cast & crew for an award, cause in the end this movie is just another silly paradox to me.7 out of 10 for the effort and cinematic value. A good movie but still nothing new artistically speaking.",7,3,7,26 December 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," Not even close to the first one! Shame.
","Too much talk, no action, no humor, no good enough plot and not big enough ending. You keep watching and expecting something really big to happen to make a climax, but suddenly you realize it's the ending. A real disappointment concerning the big names involved and the great acting.And what was the deal with that nose? The tasks were made to seem pretty easy to achieve and there was nothing left from the former glory of the team.A movie without spirit and essence.A shame really! Glad there's not going to be a forth one.",4,16,31,9 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," The best threquel of summer 2007, hands down!
","I simply loved it.I liked the first and second Bourne movies, but I can't say I was a big fan; but I really loved this one. I couldn't find anything to moan about it while I was watching it, - everything was perfect. The script was fine, the directing even better - including those shaky fight scenes that some didn't enjoy but I thought were brilliant, - the acting was great, the fight scenes jaw-dropping and there were even some pleasant surprises in the storyline and character development that I would say were a perfect hit, like the relationship between Bourne and Nicky.I totally agree with the rest who say that Damon was born for this role, even though it was hard for me at first to see him as an action hero.Well, I hope they are really happy with this movie cause they have really done an outstanding work. Honestly, this is without doubt the best threquel of this summer. A totally deserved 10.Go Damon!",10,3,6,17 August 2007
Man of Steel," So much potential, yet such disappointment.
","I love Superman, I think he's the greatest of all the superheroes. So it saddens me to see that apparently it is so hard to get his movie just right. The four films that Reeve did were a joke, while Bryan Singer's one failed in a few big ways. Man of Steel showed such potential with the new take on Superman's story and the names behind it, such as Nolan, who I thought did an amazing job with the first two Batman movies. Yet it was let down completely by the script and some story-line choices that just didn't work. I will not enter into much detail here as there's actually so much that bugs me with this movie, but I will mention just a few things, like the need to destroy entire cities and kill thousands of people just to make the movie dark and serious. The problem with that is that, this inadvertently makes Superman guilty of mass murder and not the savior that he is supposed to be. Also, the fight scenes were so computerized that it made me feel like I was actually playing a video-game. Some dialogues were just horrible and unworthy of the blockbuster they were part of. And there were so many things that didn't make sense or questions raised, that when all put together, leave a bad taste of disappointment in the mouth.A shame really; I have no desire to play the critic, I just feel frustrated that this wasn't the movie that I was hoping for and could have been. I hope there's a very extended version when it comes out on DVD, that will contain some more material to make it feel more complete.",6,4,9,25 June 2013
The Incredibles," Simply the best!
","The best superhero movie ever. I mean, who needs real actors and scenes, they haven't managed to make a decent one ever, but if they ever do, I sure hope this is what they will come up with. I really like the style of this movie; it's not just another animation flick like the boring 'funny' ones we see coming out almost every month now; it's a real movie, only animated. But who cares, right. They have done a damn good job. Great script, great graphics, great voicing, - I love the fact that they haven't made all characters look like Brangolina. You find yourself feeling complete and satisfied ate the end, which never happens with superhero movies.Anyway...I just hope, they won't screw it up and decide on a sequel. We all know how they go, don't we. Excellent, once again.",10,1,1,16 June 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Good but not great!
","I think it's safe to say that when it comes to special effects we have no more expectations, they all nail it these days. This movie was no exception, good graphics and pretty colors as another guy here said. Unfortunately, the moment the special effects kicked in the world of the movies, the good old script got a good kick in the nuts and can barely stand now let alone hold a whole movie on it's feet. This movie again, it's no exception. I have to admit, the plot was OK, the lines good, there was humor, romance, action, a reasonable balance to everything. Yet, I could not feel it taking me in; I remained a spectator, while the short dialogs even though containing the essence of the story, were still dry and well, short. No wonder the movie was a mere 92 minutes. Conclusion, a good PG movie, a bit better than the first one, but which still failed big time to impress, just like the rest of this summer blockbusters.",6,121,203,15 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Good but not great!
","Maybe it's just me but I really feel like there's just nothing original anymore. I saw the movie the first day it came out, really hopeful, fueled by all the good reviews on paper, - especially here in UK where they just love to praise anything they produce, - and I liked it, just not that much. The trailers keep fooling me, making me think that this is it, this is the one that won't disappoint me. Honestly, I don't know what was wrong with this movie, I'm not a professionist to judge right. All I know is what I perceive from a spectator's point of view, and I know that I felt like everything was so predictable; and even when something happened that was unexpected to me (and the rest who have not read the books I guess)I just didn't feel the impact of it. They tried to give a boost to Harry's emotional side in this movie but I'm afraid they failed just short of it. I didn't feel he was connected enough to the relevant characters (I'm trying not to give spoilers here)in order to portray and justify his actions and reactions right. A good movie though I think I prefer the fourth one, but that's just me. Anyway, maybe I'll like it better if I see it a second time. 8 out of 10",8,0,1,14 July 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Boring and stupid!
","This was without a doubt the most boring and stupid movie I have seen lately. I only gave it 2 points because I like Christina Applegate. The only funny scene in the whole movie was the one where the dog gets kicked of the bridge; I just couldn't stop laughing there even though I know that would not seem funny to many animal lovers. As for the rest of the movie, I just hated it. The story was stupid, the script terrible, and Will Ferrell's acting made it even more stupid. I just cannot believe some other big names like Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn agreed to be part of this charade. I bet they regret it now. Can't they tell a bad project when they see one? Well, if childish stupid fun is what you guys are after, watch this one; otherwise, skip to something else.",2,5,11,13 June 2007
Music and Lyrics," Nice change, good music. Enjoyable!
","It's always a delight to see Drew Barrymore and this was a good matchmaking with Hugh Grant. The guy's got some notes within him; surprising.I really enjoyed this movie, especially the music, being an eternal eighties fan. It was hard to get used to all that but-shaking from Grant who looked way out of his waters, and I couldn't believe it was really his voice until I double checked to be sure; but all in all, he did a great job. Drew's performance was as always perfect. Without her, this movie with any other actress, would have been boring really.I thought the story was well developed, I liked most of the lines, didn't like some of them. One thing I wish they would have added in the script, was a part where Sophie finally manages to tell what she really thinks and feels about Sloan to his face. I mean, Alex did manage to tell Cora what he thought about the song. But, anyway, not much harm done there.For all POP fans out there, watch this movie; rockers and hip-hop dudes, sleep time.",8,1,2,23 June 2007
The Dark Knight Rises," Over-hyped. Nolan disappoints this time.
","I love what Nolan did with the Batman story. Batman Begins was great, The Dark Knight was simply a brilliant masterpiece; so I went into the cinema full of expectation for this third and final installment. I was a bit let down. It was a good stand alone movie, but with a poor story even if it had not been the final of the trilogy. Again it had a great cast that did their job well, though their characters this time around were quite flat and two-dimensional. It was definitely not, as great as The Dark Knight and I especially did not appreciate how Nolan carelessly destroyed what he had Batman and Gordon build with their sacrifices at the end of the second movie, as if it was a bad mistake. Surely, he could have exonerated Batman in a different way without turning his hard work and sacrifice into nothing, by bringing out the truth about Dent.Overall, the story felt as if it was put together in a hurry, and the movie did not feel very solid as a whole. Maybe it will look better the second time around, though I highly doubt it. The mistakes in editing didn't help much either, but will not insert spoilers here.Again, an OK movie though a disappointing end to the trilogy; it could and should have been better.",5,2,7,23 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not a J J Abrams movie.
","I wish I'd never seen any of the Star Wars movies, so that I could have watched The Force Awakens with a fresh eye and no Star Wars expectations. Alas, that wasn't the case. Given the director (I'm a big fan of Lost and Star Trek), as well as the hype and glowing reviews appearing everywhere, I could not help but expect something decent, despite my better judgment. What I watched was definitely a Star Wars movie and I thoroughly enjoyed being back in the galaxy and catch up with old friends. I even enjoyed meeting the new heroes, especially BB8, which I fail to understand why some people hated. As a stand alone movie, you could say it's alright, though character development is hardly perfect, and the cartoonish villains made the whole movie simply ridiculous. But it's still a good movie, for youngsters.The real Star Wars fans (not the fanatics who get picky about just anything) I'm sure were left quite unfulfilled by this new addition to the canon. Even if you hated the prequels - which I didn't - you can never ignore the richness they brought to the story and its background, and to go back to doing what amounts to just an action movie, means going backwards. It's sorta like the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie; too plain compared to the previous ones.I understand perfectly why this happened; because of all the hate and the criticism of the prequels, Disney wanted to do a facsimile of A New Hope, and that's exactly what they ended up with. Only, while time has made that movie a classic, The Force Awakens falls utterly short of that aspiration, despite the warm reception and great superficial reviews that are drowning out the more professional and unbiased ones. It's like there's a conspiracy out there to make this movie an instant hit and it seems to be working.Personally, I am sure that had Abrams not given into Disney's demands of giving the multitudes exactly what they liked from the previous movies but none of what they hated, he would have made a better movie; one that like the Star Trek reboot, would have had heart and soul. And I am sad I'll never get to see that movie.I am inclined to rate this movie 1/10 just to even out the unfair high score it's getting from people, but instead I will go for 4/10. I hope the sequel will be better and not done by Abrams, who I like too much to see him compromise on his vision and talent in this manner.",4,6,12,22 December 2015
