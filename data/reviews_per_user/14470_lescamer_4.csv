Marie Antoinette," An original film
","Clearly, Sofia has inherited Francis's talent. Like her father, she is very good at making us identify even in a period film and character study. But I'm not here to compare Sofia with Francis. I saw it in Nantes before it came out in the US and I think that for a French audience it must be very annoying to have a French figure told in a very American way. It is more about an American girl than an Austrian girl: The way Marie simply lives in her rich world and parties with friends without wondering one second if the outside world is as lucky as she is. Clearly, Sofia Coppola identifies with Marie: Like her, she is the daughter of a king, she has always had everything she wanted, etc. What I love about this film is tat it is the ultimate biography: The film may take place in the 18th century instead of the 20th and 21th, she may be Austrian instead of American, she may be the daughter of the king of Austria instead of the king of American cinema, her name may be Marie instead of Sofia, but it is very much a collision between the two. Sofia Coppola even deforms history a little to make it more clear that it is Sofia's story and not Marie's. She even goes as far as to make us listen to her own favorite music which Marie could never possibly have heard. In a way, Sofia has the same basic talents as her father- elegance, character study, character identification, a floating story- but where her father is very Italian and manly, she is very American and girly.",9,3,8,5 October 2006
The Untouchables," The Most Overrated Film of All Time
","With Scarface, The Untouchables is the most overrated film of all time. I guess Ennio Morricone's musical score, Sean Connery's performance as Jimmy Malone, Murruhm's photography, and Robert De Niro's performance as Al Capone are absolutely great and the costumes are good but, let's face it, what else? Kevin Costner's performance as Eliot Ness is not only bad but it is possibly the most annoying performance of all time. I am not even exaggerating. It is nothing but a shoot-'em-up film. The characters are simple and there is the maddening American theory of good and bad throughout the whole thing. It has aged a lot. Perhaps not as much as Scarface but still... It also features a horrible screenplay. It is unbelievably corny and cartoon most of the time.",4,5,13,25 March 2007
The Godfather: Part III," A beautiful, elegant look back at The Godfather and The Godfather Part II
","The reason for which The Godfather Part III has such a nasty reputation and is underrated is not that it is inferior, not even that it is too different from the other too, it I that it came out too late. Since it took so long to make it, people had created their own expectations for a third Godfather. If it had taken so long to make The Godfather Part II, it probably would have met with as little success. I do not know if The Godfather Part III is the best of the trilogy- I think they are all three to different to compare them- but it is certainly the one that leaves me most satisfied. It is an elegant, nostalgic, operatic, Shakespearian epilogue to The Godfather. It possesses an irresistible, inexpressible, and personal charm. One of the things I like best about The Godfather Part III is that it is an old man's film in every sense. It has the calm, relaxed feel of many films made by aging people- Bergman's Fanny and Alexander, Lean's A Passage to India, Renoir's Le Caporal Epingle. It is a meditation on the passage of times. Michael, Connie, and Kay have all changed but there remains a distant feel of how they were the last time we saw them. There are also these little moments that remind of us of 'the old days' (Vincent's way of saying 'I'll take care of it' like his grandfather Vito in the second Godfather, how Joey Zasa faintly reminds us of Don Michael in the first two film). It is a look back at the first two films through the eyes of an old Michael.",10,1,2,18 February 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Have we seen the same film?
","How can people say that it is bad? Maybe, just maybe, it is not as good as the first one. But it is still a beautiful masterpiece. The beauty of Elizabeth: The Golden Age lies in that it mixes simple, boring historical fact with personal things of her life- Her public side and her personal side. Because that's Elizabeth. She was most of all politics, but, once in a while, she had personal problems. But even the boring politics are made wonderful here because of Khapur's masterful camera and cinematographic games as well as great performances. It is all about mise en scene, this film. The sequel has the same relationship with its predecessor as The Godfather Part II: While the predecessor is about the transformation of the main character, the sequel is about the character's successful attempt to remain that way.",10,2,6,20 October 2007
