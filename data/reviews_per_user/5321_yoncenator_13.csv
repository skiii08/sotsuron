Requiem for a Dream," WOW! HARD CORE, DISTURBING
","Probably in the top 3 most disturbing movies I have ever seen.  Up there with David Lynch's 'Wild at Heart' and 'Blue Velvet', Harmony Korine's 'Kids' and 'Gummo', and 'Clean Shaven' movie bite: Jen C. is 'the most beautiful woman in the whole world' and I NEVER thought I wouldn't enjoy her in a nude X scene but the context is...well DISTURBING A+",10,0,0,5 November 2000
The Ring," unbelievable...no REALLY I didn't believe it..AT ALL
",Let's start with the good things.  The camera work is great.  The DP deserves an oscar.  If you rent the DVD you'll have to go frame by frame in a few places to really see all the great stuff lost w/ bad editing.  The kid (boy) did a great job acting.  There's a couple of beautiful actresses (term used very loosely).  There's one cool evil (heh) part in the movie. Now the bad: That one cool part comes exactly 5min 30sec before the credits roll.  The holes in this plot are inexcusable.  There's probably at LEAST a couple hundred light houses on the coastlines of America.  Is mental hospital security really that easy to circumvent? There's plenty more but don't want to spoil the ridiculous plot details. Didn't someone else make this movie before and call it 'Stir of Echos'?  This is like Stir of Echos and Ghost Ship with a VCR and without a ship.  I didn't jump once and don't EVEN try and compare this movie to the Exorcist.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The pretty shots and the end does not justify the terrible acting and story we've all seen before.,2,0,1,7 March 2003
Cloverfield," Keep swallowing (lots of spoilers)
","Visually stunning, overall a great monster movie.I found the acting to be atrocious. I understand that some suspense of disbelief is required to swallow that 4 people would run into destruction to save one of their possibly already dead friends, but how many times do I have to swallow? OK, go get the girl. OK, a girl is better defending you against LARGE alien spiders than your guy friend. OK, no one gives a crap about your injuries wipe them down yourself. OK, the military would let you film their ops headquarters. OK said military will befriend you and let you proceed alone. OK a toppled building is accessible. OK an impaled frail girl can run, jump, and not bleed or go into shock. OK, everyone (including hot impaled girl but not the pilot or co-pilot) can survive a helicopter crash from above NY skyline building level. ALRIGHT ALREADY, said impaled (though quite HOT) girl can rescue all survivors from crashed helicopter.That's a lot of swallowing.I still liked the movie, even though none of the people acted like real people would. I'd rather watch Independence Day or Starship Troopers. In fact I think I will. Not bad JJ I'm still looking forward to Star Trek!",6,0,1,6 April 2008
The Bourne Identity," Would've been the best bond movie since L.a.L.D.
","A little far fetched, but mostly in the way they give a Euro MINI about 300 horsepower and the shocks of a HumV.  Aside from that and the plot holes it was a SOLID across the board 8 film.  You can tell they edited it for a PG-13 rating, just like they do for all the bond movies.  Boy it sounds like I didn't enjoy this film but really I did.  Check the stats on imdb.  EVERY sex/age bracket gave this film at least a 7.  Pretty rare for any film. Worth having in my collection.",8,0,1,3 April 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Series worthy
","If you're reading to see if you should see T3.  YES go see it.  Worthy of the collection.  My only gripe is that you can see the U-571 sap in a few places.  I rolled my eyes, but those moments were brief and for the kids. Nitpicking here: They could've found a better babe than Clair Danes but she is adequate as far as acting.  I guess a major leader in the future of mankind's resistance probably won't be a 10.  Kristanna Loken is hot but her smirk is way too human for a terminator.",9,0,0,28 July 2003
28 Days Later...," As scary as
","As scary as the Exorcist... if you're such a WUSSIE that you couldn't make it through the first fifteen minutes of the exorcist and never saw the film. This movie IS NOT scary.  It IS interesting and very visually stimulating for an English film.  There's some good brutal moments (three I think) but other than that its really a drama movie not a horror film.  The conflict in this movie is never with the infected, which made it interesting NOT SCARY.  I'm going to say this once and for all. THERE WILL NEVER BE A MOVIE AS SCARY AS THE EXORCIST.  Which is why any movie that is just a wanna be will be compared to the ultimate of all horror films.  Not the one you never saw before but the original, scratchy film in surround sound late at night with all the lights off.  GO ON I DARE YOU...watch it alone. 28 days is f'n Willy Wonka compared to that film.",6,0,1,28 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," wow
","I was lucky enough to see this movie in Dolby digital headquarters before it was released.  Nobody kicking my seat. No one crunching candy wrappers. 10 people in a 100 person theater designed and built to impress.I can't think of anything bad to say about this film. I was captivated from beginning to end, and visually and auditorily in awe. It is perfect for surround sound theaters w/ big screens.  Don't see it any other way.  I'm sure the DVD will be even more amazing.",10,0,0,26 December 2002
The Game," Well written (couple spoilers)
","Michael Douglas' timing is superb in his delivery.  There's a few holes in this plot but so many parts that just plain ROCK.  I LOVE when the TV starts talking to him, 'but why should that matter to a fat cat millionaire like...YOU...in other news'  I can deal with movies where there's just enough meat to cover up most of the holes.  This is really a captivating movie.  The dialogue is really the meat, Deborah Unger (Christine) is totally believable.  I had a hard time believing that Michael didn't suspect her being involved from the very beginning, there was so much engaging 'stuff' in this film it didn't really matter.  I watched it a second time the next day and still really liked it.  One for my collection.",9,0,1,20 June 2004
Meet Joe Black," big Claire fan? Watch w/ the sound down
","I think it must have actually said in the script 'PAUSE A FULL 5 (OR 10) SECONDS AFTER EACH LINE' Now if you can stand this awful script, and love sappy love stories that have no substance and depend on 'meaningful glares' between beautiful people without any real acting going on, you'll love this film. There's no skin, no fun and no believable chemistry at all in this movie. I figure there is a whole generation of soap opera addicted, brad pitt worshiping youth that just love this movie. Claire is beautiful but the words coming out of her mouth here are all written for the above mentioned. I know she's capable of much better. Not even worth a watch on free cable weekend.",3,1,4,20 September 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," If hype was everything
","If hype was everything this would be the best movie that was ever made. IT'S NOT THAT GOOD.  REALLY slow moving, same old effects, and not more of them but a few bigger ones.  When you end up watching these back to back, (and you will) The truth is that there's less acting, less story, and less to care about in this movie.  I love special fx, but if I'm really tired of the bond/XXX/Mission Impossible no plot stories.  Matrix I is really unique. Reloaded is just like the title would imply.  Rehash with big explosions.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
Arrival," Oh the stupidity, so many things wrong with this film.
","I'm a fan of SciFi, I'm a fan of time travel movies, I'm a fan of Amy Adams, I thought Sicario was a really good film. Arrival is one of the worst, poorly thought out, stupid alien films I've ever seen. I was appalled at the horrible CGI of the fake helicopters. My intelligence was insulted by the superior yet inept communications of the aliens. Why did no one think to show these guys a video? Really? a dry erase board? That's the best communication idea we have to share with an advanced alien race? This film doesn't have any deep meaning behind it, there's no 'leave it up to the viewer' interpretation. There's nothing that isn't completely pedantic, spelled out and spoon fed to the masses and nothing that brilliant or that isn't predictable either. I don't know why this film is so popular. There's nothing enlightening about language in this film. Inglorious Basterds had more incite to language and communication that this film. I honestly don't see any draw here. Is this for people that don't normally like SciFi? That have no concept of what a believable alien contact film might be like? Close Encounters is more plausible than this horrible representation. I can't imagine anyone would actually want to sit through this film more than once. It could have easily been edited down by 30 minutes and still conveyed its (weak) message. I find it difficult to believe that this is the same director of Sicario. Boo for the public having such low standards in movies.",2,11,20,17 February 2017
Annihilation," Scientists? Military? Anyone with common sense? None of these wrote this film.
","OK Let's start with the good. The special effects in this film start out pretty good and the cg in the end is amazing.That's all the good, now the badIn what world does any military operation let you choose whether you want to continue forward or not? One that has a procedure of coming down from a perfect vantage tower with high powered machine guns and night vision goggles to investigate loud sounds from a hostile in the immediate vicinity? One that finds the ONLY video record of a previous failed mission and 1) doesn't even watch it to the end 2) discards it as 'light tricks' and of no use at all and 'they must have gone crazy'?  In what scientific community (military or not) do scientists discover their group has missing time and does absolutely nothing to try and record or mark intervals and note (write down, mark your arm ANYTHING) when time passes? How in the hell do you see a hostile mutant giant crocodile, and one of your team are taken by a giant mutant bear and you want to go into the jungle ALONE to find them? Even if she were completely crazy, how does one woman overpower three healthy good sized women that all have firearms and knives that they carry at all times?The final act is worth watching just for the cg. If the writers had only spent a few of those millions of dollars on consultants instead of day glow lichens, this would have been a more enjoyable ride, but as it stands I barely made it through there were so many WTF dialog and plot moments that I couldn't stop thinking 'MAN this is really bad film writing' through most of it. If it was necessary to lose one character, let her own cloudy mind take her down the tower to be killed. NOT EVERYONE LOSE THEIR MINDS and act like a thirteen year old girl would in that situation. These are supposed to be seasoned military and highly educated women. I didn't buy it and it was insulting to anyone watching. How about showing some respect for scientific method and good old plain common sense. So the moral of this story is, 'If you're not sure what it is, KILL IT BEFORE IT KILLS YOU' ?????What a horrible lesson for our already xenophobic society. Blech.",3,1,2,30 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Spoilers, Well Ridley time to let go I think.
","I'm not really sure how, but Ridley Scott has now made the worst of all the Alien films. Even Resurrection was more interesting than this film. I went in with low expectations and I didn't expose myself to any trailers or spoilers so I gave it a real chance to rise above. I enjoyed Prometheus. There was so much from the original yet so much new and I thought while it still didn't answer many questions it gave a lot to the series and some good extreme moments but stayed true to the canon. Covenant just doesn't make sense. Quarantine protocols are obviously mentioned, yet no one seems to use them in either of the last 2 films. How did David make an egg without a queen? If he could make an egg why couldn't he make an alien? How does the more advanced artificial person not outsmart the deficient one?? How does another Engineer ship make it to LV-426? Goddammit now we're going to have to sit through at least one (more likely two) more films to connect the whole series and this one didn't even make much advancement on the story. I just wish that both of the last 2 films would have been written with characters that were more believable. I'm not even talking about the engineers. The first film, the mining crew, even though it had blue collar individuals, they had concerns about being payed full shares and got ANGRY when one single alien was taking out their entire crew. They weren't exploring unknown planets with their EVA suits open smelling and touching as many foreign objects as they could before returning to the ship.Aside from all the holes, gone also is all the tension, No one that rises above in the crew, no one to root for. I actually started rooting for the alien which I know won already because well LV-426. WE ALL know the aliens win. I understand the plot problems when you already know who has to win to connect to the first film, but I don't know anyone that would follow and trust a character that I just found out murdered other humans. It's completely safe just stick your head near the opening of a huge egg I just created. NOPE. This could have been the film that left you ANXIOUS for the next film, not dreading it. Now I just want to watch 1-4 and say OK the should have left it at that.",4,6,12,25 May 2017
