The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Not Just a High School Movie
","Went to an advance screening expecting your usual 'shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself' sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!",10,604,682,28 August 2012
