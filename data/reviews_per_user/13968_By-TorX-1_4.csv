Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Easily the Best Film about Space Tax Disputes, Ever!
","When we think back to the halcyon days of Star Wars, with its timeless narrative, thrilling space battles and heroes, heroines and villains that defined a generation and live on, immortal in the pantheon of popular culture, we realise that for all of their brilliance there was one thing missing: lengthy discussions of tax disputes.But fear not! In 1999 George Lucas at last recognised his terrible mistake and rectified it to create an accountant/bureaucrat/corporate lawyer's science fiction dream movie. Now we have an iconic titles sequence that contains evocative words like 'tax!' and 'trade disputes!' in place of nonsense like evil Empires, Death Stars, and the glorious fight between good and evil. Furthermore, spectacles such as epic space battles and outlandish cantinas filled with fabulous creatures are downplayed to make way for marvellous and protracted scenes of thrilling space councils with diplomats and other such august personages earnestly debating trading laws in great detail! It has its critics, for sure, but my response to such naysayers is that Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was and is a visionary work of tax and trade negotiation-based genius.",3,2,4,8 January 2014
The Maze Runner," A Maze of Ideas: The Ultimate Pan-Optic Mystery
","Aside from its kinetic action and proto-juvenile cinematic tropes, The Maze Runner is also unique in that it (however improbably) strikingly offers a sustained philosophical and theological methodology that speaks to past and present thought orders and cultural configurations. In terms of precise ontic collectives that the alphic film explores, it arguably principally factors upon the central heliocentric primal-narrative that underscores the classic 'So-Called Proper Name' metaphysical principle, a proposal that has haunted European epistemological revelation for at least five centuries, and which led to the valiant (but doomed) post-Enlightenment quest for the ur-standard in pseudo-ludology. Moreover, in the middle section, the film progresses to cryptically evoke the imaginary mediation of the De Interpretation-like inescapable traction that Zoran Toltec argued bedevilled ancient Greek thought, and so it brings to light the near-forgotten Scythian teleological dilemma in synthesis with the broken thread of the modern 'Beauborg Maxim.' All of this places the filmic chronicle, in its quasi-zenith, within the confines of a delirious (yet grounded) apotheosis of illusion, and (somewhat audaciously, it must be said) incontrovertibly presents a pan-optic mandala scenario to confront both the characters and the cinematic audience directly and without compromise. Consequently, in the final sequences of the first chapter, this is ultimately the character of Thomas's non-physical/embodied MÃ¶bius status: an immanent and immutable rhizoid stasis within a revitalised and hyper-heterogeneous simulacrum of what Viktor Imzadi famously dubbed the 'Labyrinth of the Eternal Thought Cavern.' Thus, it will be interesting to see where the series takes these ideas, but from the philosophical foundation that is central to the first instalment, it seems evident to me that the story will inevitably journey into the very heart of Kazimir Yadlo's conception of the primordial Origami Cosmos thesis.",10,0,0,4 April 2017
Dark Shadows," Less Would Have Been Much More
","If Burton had scaled back the action to include only Barnabas, Angelique and Victoria/Josette, then the film would have worked 100% better than it does. However, he tries to shoehorn many of the elements contained within Dark Shadows the series (which runs to countless episodes) and as a result the film collapses under its own weight, with ghosts and werewolves aplenty thrown into the chaotic climax. The film looks great, and Eva Green is as marvellous as ever, (with Depp in camply amusing form, albeit in a role that he basically sleepwalks through) but the tone is all over the place. One minute the film is Gothic horror and vampiric murders, the next it's slapstick comedy, then it's all Austin Powers 'man-out-of-time' farce until finally, sadly, it is an empty and noisy CGI-fest. Furthermore, Chloe Grace Moretz and Helena Bonham Carter give the film little to nothing (I'm not blaming the actresses though, as their characters are just not fleshed out enough, and Moretz's supernatural contribution is simply too little and comes way too late in the game to give anything but palm-slaps to the face on the part of the viewers), and so they just take up valuable screen-time. Perhaps directors shouldn't remake shows that they love, as it seems to seldom pan out well.",6,1,1,13 April 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Holy Fromage, Batman! A Swiss Cheese Smorgasbord of Plot Holes
","Hailed by some as the best film ever, I found The Dark Knight Rises to be a shambles and a poor end to a supposed 'epic' trilogy as, at its mighty climax, the viewer is left with so many hows and whys, such as: If Batman has been off the scene for years, how come Bruce Wayne is so battered and maimed? Who has he been fighting? And if so, how does one leg brace instantly cure him? If the brace could do that, then why not use it sooner? Did he think that the limp made him look cool? Also, how does Bruce Wayne get from the desert prison back to Gotham City? And how does he shrug off a deep knife wound and jump out of the flying typewriter (that's what the 'plane' looks like to me - the design in the film is horribly clunky and visually indistinct) over the Gotham river unobserved and unscathed so he can then jet off with Selina for an incognito life (one in which nobody has a smartphone and takes pictures of him to sell to Hello! to garner a 'Bruce Wayne is Alive!' cover exclusive)? Who indeed is 'Catwoman' (she is never called that)? What is her story, and how does she have such incredible fighting skills? I would like to have seen that at least hinted at as Anne Hathaway shines in the role and is the only real bright spot in the entire film. Also, would EVERY single Gotham cop go into the sewers? Really, ALL of them? Once entombed, they all just languish underground (quite happily, by the looks of it) for three months before being freed to engage in an A-Team-style battle with Bane's mob (loads of gunfire, but hardly any hits). Indeed, where are the illustrious denizens of Arkham Asylum during Bane's reign of terror? (Oh, yes, we briefly see Scarecrow, so that's that sorted, then). Meanwhile, in the sunny hellhole prison of undank darkness, Bruce was either lounging in bed or suspended from a rope during his tenure there, so, bar some pressups, where does he suddenly find the power to knock out the seemingly unstoppable Bane? And then, finally, sadly, we have 'Robin', who is just an average-sized cop (who knows Batman's true identity, thanks to 'Orphan Telepathy') with no specialist skills or knowledge, so what is he supposed to do with the Batcave? It took Bruce Wayne a lifetime to become the Dark Knight, so what is a cop going to do with the cave and its technology? Or perhaps Bruce Wayne left a helpful note explaining how the various gizmos work, who knows? As an ending to the trilogy, TDKR is deeply unsatisfying and has a script that closely resembles swiss cheese. To be honest, I didn't think that Batman Begins was much cop either, but that had Liam Neeson and The Dark Knight had the tour-de-force presence of Heath Ledger, but TDKR only has poor Tom Hardy mumbling unintelligibly through a mask and hardly any Batman action. Oh, and the plot is pretty much the same as the Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. Ultimately, Berberian Sound Studio probably has less open plot threads than The Dark Knight Rises. What a pity.",6,3,5,20 May 2015
