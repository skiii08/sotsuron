50 First Dates," When Rob Schneider has the best performance in a film, you know you are in trouble
","I went to this movie expecting to like it.  I usually enjoy Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler had good chemistry with her in 'The Wedding Singer'.  50 First Dates starts with a sad premise (a person with short term memory loss), and then adds a ridiculous idea (that someone would try to meet this person and 'reromance' her on a daily basis, after she forgets him) to attempt another 'romantic comedy', which, as usual, was not romantic and not funny.  Fortunately, Rob Schneider (who is usually weak) is quite hilarious in his sidekick role, to keep the film from being a total waste of time. The rest of the cast seems to realize this film is a lost cause and sleepwalks through the whole affair.  I gave this film a 5/10 for Schneider's antics, plus some good performances by the trained animals (and, no, Sandler is not included as one of the animals).  Probably best to wait for cable on this one.",5,1,2,4 June 2004
The Bourne Identity," Nice spy thriller
","I have to say I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.  Not the most original storyline, but very good performances, great action sequences, great locations/scenery, and nice cinematography.  Admittedly Julia Stiles is somewhat wasted in her role (maybe not the best use of the budget, but that is not my concern), but its not like having a 'nobody' in the role would have improved the picture or anything.  I do wonder why they decided to film the last book in the series.  I think they missed the opportunity to start a series of Bourne movies based on the Ludlum novels.  Overall, worth the price of admission....8/10.",8,0,1,14 June 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Sort of enjoyable, but incredibly stupid
","This is one of those eye candy type of movies.  Great stunts, special effects, sound and cinematography (and lots of cool cars, if you are into that.)  But the story was a version of the Point Break story, with extra helpings of stupidity and inplausibility.  The characters are VERY thin, which fits right in with the rest of the script.  Amazingly, the DVD of this movie is quite well done, with excellent dts sound and a widescreen video. Lots of extras too, although I didn't bother to look at any of them (like I really want the director's commentary on this crap!)  I give this one a 3/10 for the eye candy, but don't bother to turn on your brain if you watch it. Just enjoy the show.",3,1,3,25 February 2002
No Man's Land," Scathing
","This is a very captivating film.  Well acted, well written, well paced and beautifully shot.  The film lays bare the farce of 'peacekeeping' forces, sent into a war zone without permission to actually fight back.  This is a must see.  9/10",9,1,4,24 February 2002
Ice Age," Harmless, lightweight fun
","I really wanted to like this movie, but I have to say it did not live up to my expectations.  The movie wasn't bad, necessarily, but it wasn't great either.  The voice acting was quite good, especially Denis Leary, and most of the jokes were pretty humorous, but thats about where it stops.  The plot was quite thin, even for a comedy, with a sickeningly sweet sentimental ending.  The movie was pretty slow paced, with long period of not much happening.  The animation was average at best, with the human characters looking especially bad.  The animation in this film to that of 'Monster, Inc.' or even 'Shrek' and you will see where I am coming from.  Rating 5.5 out of 10 for adults, probably about 4 for kids (too sloooow for a young attention span).",6,1,2,30 March 2002
