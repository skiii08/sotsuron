Sucker Punch," Lots of fancy CGI... dark theme... and that's about it.
","What really caught me from the very first minute of the movie was the soundtrack that is purely amazing. The intro was fascinating, as well. But at one point the script simply started to look like garbage. 3 parallel realities, unconnected, meaningless. If the point was to bring a metaphor, i can say that in my opinion it was a flop. I was expecting more of a 'Watchmen' touch, but truth is - dark theme sets only the mood, while the whole movie experience lies in the plot. There is no plot here.So, what is 'Sucker Punch' in the end? Ambitious? Indeed! Worthy? Not at all. If you expect 'The Dark Knight', 'Watchmen' or 'Sin City' you should look further.",5,4,10,8 April 2011
Wanted," It would've been good, BUT...
","I always wondered how hard it might be for someone to create a movie. You should come up with an original idea, than develop it, and so on.But it seems that the writers never had such thoughts. What do you need for a good movie? Lots! What do you need for a good-selling movie? Hmm... This one seems easier.In fact the writers invented the magic bullets and sewing machines. The rest was taken from 'Batman Begins' and 'The Matrix'. Some humor from 'Shoot 'Em Up'. And voilà! No wait! Still not enough... You cannot do something like an old great movie and call it great, too. This is the moment when you call on Angelina and Morgan!I'll stop pretending to be a critic. What's wrong? Are nowadays movies only for making profits? Yes, i agree: the director did a great job. So did the actors and the designers. But remember: great movies create great actors. In order for great actors to create another great movies.And this movie is not the case. It left me quite disappointed and made me feel like watching the Classics again.9 out of 10 for actors and crew. 3 out of 10 for originality and creativity. 7 out of 10 overall.",7,1,4,10 July 2008
The Fountain," Probably the Best Movie ever made
","Honestly speaking I was expecting either mystical, sci-fi style in which 'Pi' was created or dramatic and brutal - as seen in 'Requiem for a Dream'. But I was truly shocked and impressed!This movie, the entire action is actually separated from reality, offering us a unique spiritual experience by viewing it. It is almost perfect (I'm afraid to call it perfect, still...) Its bittersweet taste of sorrow, joy, hope and faith overwhelms our emotions. Our mind tries to percept the flow of emotions, still not able. A strange tranquilityÂ… Can't describe it. May be I should not. The genius mind stands on the other side of the movie we watch. Thank you, Mr. Aronofsky. And thank you Mr. Mansell for the beautiful and profound OST.",10,0,2,27 January 2007
WALL·E," More than you could've ever expect
","Kind and serene, yet strong and meaningful.These are the feelings you'll definitely get by viewing this movie. No need to speculate over its similarities with the masterpieces from the past. There are always things one may not like (one may be even bothered by the Mac sound WALL·E does when charging, although quite a deserved tribute to Steve Jobs and his effort to bring Pixar to all of us). But besides the beautiful details, there is something more. The idea, and what's even more important - the atmosphere of WALL·E will fascinate any viewer, whether he is a child, a teenager or an adult. For sure this animated movie will run for at least another Oscar, but it doesn't even matter as long as seeing it time after time is still an enjoyable activity.",10,2,5,6 July 2008
