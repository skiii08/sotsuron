The Finest Hours," Loved this movie, the whole family will love this pulse pounding roller coaster
","This director has pushed the bounds of new camera angles. The story was brought to life in a very dramatic way.A story about people who run into burning buildings when were all running out. Told in a new novel way, that draws you in.This movie riveted me to the seat, read the amazon reviews for the book...same thing.I've been very suspicious of Disney movies recently and will only let my kids watch them after I've seen them. This movie is safe for the family, a little to intense for the young. But it is the way movies should be made to create role models for the youth to emulate. Real Men, Real Heroes I believe there is a move to discredit movies like this.I'm been on sail boats in waves 1/4 the size in this movie and I was wondering if I was going to make it.",10,62,99,7 February 2016
13 Hours," A very good Movie !!!...Review By Non American
","With all the political stuff flying around, Hillary and the emails. This movie shows up.(save you time reading, the movie is a knuckle biting action thriller Go See It)I'm going to reveal the real spoiler........what the cover up was all about.There were weapons lost.....there was a stand down.....but that is not what I believe this event was all about.The real loss and tragedy was the covered up assassination of an American Ambassador. After seeing the movie it was clear to me what this was all about. Libya was cut off from the world, sort of like Cuba was for 40 years. In this child like state there was a country that could be molded into anything. Political clay of sorts.In walks a very charismatic likable man with a desire to change Libya for the better, the ambassador had worked teaching English in Muslim countries while a youth in the Peace Core. He was a true believer and a boy scout like person.....he never got the State Department memo...The the middle east was to be let fall into chaos......The greatest loss was that of hope....U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens....is an un-sung hero. A man who wanted to make the world a better place, not knowing that his loss was a message to the rest of the politicians how things are going to go down in that part of the world and if you don't go along with the plan...........I want to thank Michael Bay and the cast and crew. For making a movie that pulls us in, entertains and tells a story.I don't buy movies....I'll be buying this one....I'll be going to see Michael Bay movies in the theater from now on. This movie helps to heal a broken world.",10,4,12,6 February 2016
