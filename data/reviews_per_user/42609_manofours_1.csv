Child 44," ddd
","I don't know, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. Why on earth some people believe it was derogatory I can't comprehend.I'm a Moscow citizen and I can claim it's vehemently pro-Russian. It's quite authentic too. Never in my life did I watch such a moving story about my parents and grandparents. The only thing I would like to add is that the scenery is sometimes too posh and neat but I can imagine that the Western directors wouldn't understand the misery of the Soviet life.For those interested in the history of Russian Hell in the XX century I would also recommend Huston's 'The Kremlin Letter' which also suffered from the bad publicity while being the most plausible description of the Soviet life under Communists.It would be a shame if some pro-Communist propagandists prevent you from watching this masterpiece.The plot in the original novel is even richer so I would suggest reading it too.",9,5,10,7 August 2015
