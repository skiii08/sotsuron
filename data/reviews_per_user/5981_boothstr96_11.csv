Requiem for a Dream," An Essential Film
","Darren Aronofsky treads waters I believe no director has treaded before. His entire film depicts the theme of the nature of drug addiction. The four characters affected by it provide a stronghold for Aronofsky's point. Never have I seen a film that delves deep within the soul and changes a person. If you have any sort of addiction at all, watch this film, it will change you. I guarantee it. Many people hear and even comprehend the downside to every addiction. But until you see it in plain black and white you do not know what you are really going through. See, an addiction is able to continue its course of poisoning the soul because it masks the truth from the being it parasites from. That person believes they are in euphoria. Yet, to everyone else, they look utterly ridiculous. It takes watching addiction run its course to realize our own addictions and how to resolve them. Aronofsky realizes this and geniously uses cinematic techniques such as change in tone, setting, and trippy special effects to come across with his point. The tone of the film shifts as the addiction takes over. It becomes more grimy as the film progresses. The setting adds to the grimyness of the plot seeing as the main characters live in a less fortunate or ghetto neighborgood. Last of all the trippy special effects are straight disturbing and strike the soul within the human being watching the film. It makes one realize that they think they may have it so great. But anything you are addicted to it too good to be true. Overall, Aronofsky crafts a film that delves deep within the conscience of the human mind. It does more than any other film I have ever seen. Every thing in this film was perfect for the message Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. It takes seeing this movie to really understand the impact of the message portrayed. I can honestly say that I am a changed person after watching this film and I highly suggest you watch it, no matter who you are. No matter if you have an addiction, know someone who has an addiction, or have no addiction at all. This film will open your eyes to the reality of life and make you want to help those who succumb to their own minds and give into impulsive demands. Ten stars for this one. A truly perfect film.",10,0,1,26 June 2010
Iron Man 2," Convincing Film
","The thing that is so hard to do in films is to make your content convincing. This is why so many other films fail. Favreau does not fail. I was worried going into Iron Man 2 that it wasn't going to live up to its hype and its prequel. But it did. The only criticism I have is that it is a bit slow for its type of movie. However, the content within the slower scenes is often filled with witty dialogue, low-key visual spectacles, and some confusing concepts. What I'm trying to get at is that Iron Man's audience is typically smaller children, and for them, I would say this movie is going to be a bit boring, for it lacks in the action department for the most part. But what may be its downfall box-office-wise is also its greatest accomplishment. Much like the Dark Knight, Iron Man 2 takes the superhero world and not-cheesily but convincingly conveys what it would be like in today's world. Not to mention we actually see Tony Stark go through a hero cycle in this one, without taking away his compulsive and loud personality. All in all, Iron MAn's long awaited release was worth it in my eyes. It was a perfect movie to kick off the Summer hype films and it makes me eager to watch what else Favreau has planned for the franchise.",8,3,4,8 May 2010
Hot Fuzz," Simply amusing
","In every genre of movie i take a different approach that way i enjoy all film genres. This one is just simply hilarious for viewers. There are little jokes you have to catch so pay attention while watching it. Frost and Pegg work so well together in this film and the camera work reminds us a lot of Shaun of the Dead. The quick flashing film shots bnring back Shaun memories. Also the climactic scene delivers some great action which also is amusing. Wright is truly a genius for crafting this film and Shaun of the Dead, the content he incliudes reminds us a lot of hit comedy shows like family guy and others. The humor is so quick and witty it sometimes makes us think and those are usually the funniest jokes. The 'Oh i Get It' type jokes. One great film.",9,1,2,23 April 2007
Disturbia," Superb film. Caruso will be Recognized
","Though most probably won't notice this, this film really showed the reality of human nature as well as the scaryness of it. The acting was so realistic towards the situations i actually was scared for each of them. What i mean is, when the Asian dude has to get the code for the garage, you can see how freaked out he gets and that is what people really would do. Most actors act like we never would. And the characters only 'go after the creepy noises' (which we all hate in movies) when they need to save someone. Caruso really thought about all the angles of it well. Also when the new neighbor has a party and he sees her talking to other guys. We see him get jealous and we all know that really happens in life. The story is 'slow' getting into the main plot that we have seen in the trailer but it is amusing and still keeps you intrigued. They also throw in some good humor that keeps us amused. Overall this was a really great film and i recommend every one go watch it.",9,1,4,23 April 2007
Saw III," Still Great... But not as good as the others.
","OK so on Friday (opening day) and Saturday i saw this movie. It was an awesome movie no doubt. It was packed with loads of gore, I am talking like more than Hostel. But the story was not as good as the other two Saw films. This one relied on making the movie good based on gore and violence instead of cleverness like the other two. Which is understandable because that is what teenagers these days like to see is gore. When the first film was made it was extremely low budget so they could do what they wanted with it. But once that got great ratings and the second one as well, i think they got a bit pressured to make this one extra gory just so the film would do extra well. My personal favorite thing about Saw was the twists that it provided. This ones twist was a bit weak but still clever. So don't get me wrong the movie still kicked, but it was not as clever and as well put together as the other ones. Still a must see.",7,0,1,29 October 2006
The Number 23," What Are Critics Thinking?
","I went to see this movie this weekend along with Reno 911 and Bridge to Teribithia. I was impressed by Reno's humor, to me Bridge sucked.But oh wow. Number 23 was an almost perfect movie. What most critics probably don't realize is the amount of thinking that went into this movie. The ending quote about sins finding you out sums up the whole film and it is from Numbers- 32:23.I usually go with my friend every two Saturdays and we movie-hop. In the past six weeks this was by far the best film I have seen. A great twist in the end, though somewhat predictable is a big thumbs up. Surprisingly Jim Carrey's acting is somewhat good. You almost think he really is going psycho.Thumbs way up.'It was almost a perfect movie.' - Michael Hu (he's one of the kids I went to see it with.)",9,0,1,26 February 2007
Transformers," MOre than meets the eye (fo real)
","Every single thing (except for one) about this movie.. was fantastic. From amazing action to stunning visuals, to ear splitting great sound, Trnasformers was the only summer blockbuster to live up to its hype. When you have movies like SP3 or Pirates that simply did not fully cut the deal, Transformers does. The only problem with this movie is the humor (in some parts). Some of the humor is great, but when there is a serious, basa**, action sequence and you have the robots shoutin out jokes, it makes the serious scenes seem a bit like a joke. Anyways, I have always been a big fan of Transformers, and i must say that this stuck to the cartoon storyline very well and opened up the possibility of future sequels. The voices of the robots were amazing and the sounds used were as well. Seriously, the sound could make the movie in its own. I recommend seeing this more than once for pure entertainment because it does not led up the whole way!!!",10,4,7,13 July 2007
Clash of the Titans," It's Only Getting a 2 Cuz My Personality is too Nice to Give it a 1
","Terrible film. Waste of my time. Pathetic excuse for cinema. I must say the trailer intrigued me. Whereas most people seem to be against remaking films, I actually enjoy seeing remakes and adaptations. I think it's a cool idea. But, this film did a terrible job of adapting. Right from the beginning the whole movie seemed rushed. Not to mention they try to explain way too much. Right from the beginning, a female voice explains exactly what you are about to see. And throughout the movie, the characters are so obvious in explaining what will happen in the future events of the plot it seems like a down syndrome patient wrote the dialogue. Persiuss' guardian angel explains what he needs to do the entire time. Everyone likes seeing it when the protagonist solves the riddle by dilligence and investigation, not being guided by somebody. I don't care if he's a demi-god, he seems too catered too throughout the plot. Take for instance in the end when the Kraken is about to munch that girl. All he does is show it Medusa's face and it turns to stone (a suggestion that his guardian angel gave him way earlier in the plot so we knew it was gonna happen). There's no conflict, he doesn't struggle against the climactic enemy. The characters are so surfaced that we wanna call the characters by their real-life names rather than their characters names. The special effects looked like sci-fi's low-budget films and the humor was so not funny it was actually sad. Halfway through my friend and I considered walking out but were so anxious to see the kraken scene which turned out to be a whopping two minutes. All in all the movie seemed like an excuse to destroy a couple buildings, remake a movie, and put Sam Worthington in a skirt. Whatever happened to the witch's prophecy that he was gonna die. That mighta made the movie worth seeing. . . if he died at the beginning.",2,0,1,9 May 2010
Mystic River," A Chillingly Real Film
","At first when I saw the ending to this film, I was like 'what?' that's it? He kills the wrong guy and just shrugs at the end. Then it hit me what a powerful ending it was. It was supposed to make me feel that way. This film was not supposed to be about one man consoling himself and finding his daughter's killer, it was supposed to be the real story of a hard nosed man out of Boston, driven solely by revenge to commit whatever acts he felt necessary in order to avenge his daughter's death. The way Lehane drew all his characters and their situation together is remarkable, I don't want to reveal too much. What makes this movie so great, is the fact that Lehane and Eastwood could take a real story and still put a chilling twist and an entertaining plot to it. Not to mention Sean Penn delivers one of the best acting performances I have seen. Everything about his character is so convincing. As a word of warning, nothing about this movie is happy so don't watch it if your looking for a happy-go-lucky drama film. This film gets increasingly depressing as each scene unfolds, but it is such a masterpiece in every way. IF you can stomach it, I recommend watching this film because it will blow you away.",9,0,0,9 May 2010
Shooter," Killer Movie
","Mark Whalberg's performance is stunning in Antoine Fuquas (however you spell it) Shooter. The scenes that are shot are spectacular, and now to the action. The strategic planning and cleverness of the story makes for one great action fick. I believe anyone who loves just plain bada** action and a clever plot. However, my criticism towards it is the fact that the people use his ex-partner's wife to be the bribe to get what they want. I mean, he just talked to her for the first time. lol. However, without that criticism, i believe this movie was awesome and that any action fan who loves a non-cliché action film, in case your wondering what i mean, this is a complimentarily unique action film that is very realistic and shows true human nature. Almost perfect.",9,1,4,24 March 2007
300," A Great Film... almost perfect.
","Though my biggest preference in the action genre is to have a highly stylized theme, i believe this one went to over the top with about 30 minutes done in slow motion. Also the scene in the tent with the goat playing the flute was a bit odd, but hey its frank miller. And last, the most hilarious sex scene i have ever seen. Now that my complaints are out, this movie was a bad a** action film adaption from Frank Miller. Zack Snyder's camera work is as amazing as Sin City and the animated 'video-game' blood throws in another punch saying 'yeah, it's that bad a**.' All around this movie is perfect without my couple of complaints. Everything you see in the trailer is what you see in the film..top notch. A-.",9,2,6,20 March 2007
