The Finest Hours," Not a good movie
",This is not a good movie. It's pretty long and boring. I only give it 2 points because of the special effects. The perfect storm which is another disaster movie is 10 times better than this. This movie has too many jargons that left the viewers not knowing what's happening half the time.,2,4,7,28 August 2017
The Equalizer," Not a bad movie
","This is a bad ass movie.Denzel Washington's role is cool. The fight scenes and cat and mouse scenes are cool too. The atmosphere set and the tempo is cool too. A little tad too long at 2.11 hours, otherwise cool movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an action flick.7/10",7,0,2,14 August 2017
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," A delightful romantic comedy
","I was quite entertained with this movie especially after so many disappointments lately.Everyone should give this movie a chance. I can guarantee that you won;t be disappointed if you don't set your expectations too high.It;s very written and directly. I was guessing along the movie what;s going to happen next. There wasn't a boring moment in the movie.To all the haters , why all the hate. i don;t understand why would anyone hate this movie.Kudos to the director and writer. I would be watching Ms. Congenialty next.",9,0,1,8 May 2017

Jackie," Bored
",This has to be the worst movie i watched this year. I don't know much about the life of the Kennedy and still don't know anything about her after watching the movie. This movie tried very hard to be artistic but ended up confusing me with all the disjointed bits and pieces.It's very hard to follow the story.Natalie Portman's acting is so forced and fake.The dialogues are just too difficult to follow. 0/10 for me.,1,2,5,15 August 2017
Get Out," Super Entertaining.
",Wow. I haven't been so entertained for a long time. This movie is so cleverly written and directed and acted. I wasn't bored even for a second. The whole movie has a sense of quirkiness to it. You don't know what to expect next. And the ending was good too. Don't believe all the haters out there. This one is definitely not to be missed.8/10 maybe even 8.5/10,10,9,19,29 August 2017
Pitch Perfect 2," Same old same old terrible unfunny jokes
","Pitch Perfect 2 what a load of crap. I can't understand how this movie get a franchise, a third movie is coming out soon. The first pitch perfect was terrible, this second part is almost as bad. Rebel Wilson is NOT funny. Anna Kendrick is lost in this movie. Hailey Steinfield is injected for some blood but couldn't save the show.2/10 cos it's just a little better than the first one and that is an awful 1/10.",2,2,3,24 August 2017
Wonder Woman," What a letdown
","Wow, what a letdown. I enjoyed the 70's TV series so much. What a waste of budget. Gal Gadot needs lots of acting lessons. Not a single good thing to say about this movie. I can't understand how it managed to gross so much at the box office, maybe because she's sexy and show a little bit of skin.Lots of WAR propaganda, which is personally not my cup of tea. The special effects are second rate at best. Chris Pine looks sexy though.1/10 don't waste your resources.Better use it for studying if you are student that is. Or if you're an idiot go ahead and watch it, but i can guarantee that you wouldn't like it.",1,6,17,9 September 2017
Pitch Perfect," What a STUPID and BORING movie
",Everything is bad about this movie. Not a single redeeming quality. Nada. The story is lame. The one liner jokes are not funny at all. The characters are not developed at all. I was bored from beginning to end.I have no idea why it got a sequel and a third part.Please don't watch this piece of crap.,Null,1,2,27 July 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Wham Bam , Mostly Bam
","What can i say. It is a bad movie by any standard. The script was not existent. Keanu's acting is really bad, even his limping is bad.His lines are not longer than 5 words. (And miraculously he doesn't age at all. I want the name of his plastic surgeon, please.) His face is always covered in blood for whatever reason. The shootings are like in an arcade game with no finese.There is some entertainment values i might add. There's non stop action with lots of shootings if you're into that , that is. The cinematography is quite good. I like the shoot outs in the museum.That's a plus point.",2,1,3,21 August 2017
The Proposal," A Complete waste of time.
",I was most unfortunate to watch this terrible 'romantic comedy'. The plot is just non existent.Really a pain to watch. It started out well with Sandra Bullock playing a career minded female editor and Ryan Reynolds playing her assistant. The first 10 minutes of the movie show promises but it goes downhill after they decided to go to Alaska to celebrate Ryan Reynold's grandmother's birthday. The whole plot doesn't make sense at all. Why should Sandra Bullock follow Ryan Reynolds back to Alaska? who are they trying to convince they are a couple? The romantic plot between the 2 leads are non existent. They hated each other at the beginning of the movie and without any explanation they were deeply in love in the last 10 minutes of the movie. Whoever gave this movie a positive review especially a 10 clearly has a mentality of a child.,1,3,6,8 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," Really really bad for an Alien movie.
",From a 10 (alien prometheus ) to a 1. What is Ridley Scott thinking. The writing is so bad in this movie. The space ship looks very 80's. The special effects looks like they use the technology from 10 years ago. The story is quite confusing too. There's no good point that i can give to this movie at all. 2/10 for pity sake else 1 point.,2,1,5,5 September 2017
