The Lobster," Match Maker
","The Lobster is a genius spark of insanity. A great introduction into the eccentric world of Yorgos Lanthimos. Colin Farrell is David, a man in his own personal hell. Welcome to a dystopian future, where single men and women are forced to establish romantic relationships, over the hanging threat that if they don't, they will be turned into an animal of their choice. .. and you thought Tinder was bad. Yorgos gleefully mocks the patriarchy, and has a ton of dark and twisted fun doing it. The characters, the dialogue, the locations among so much else are rich with humor. Unlike most independent films, you'll notice The Lobster consistently standing out on it's own. If you try and compare it to any classic or contemporary piece, you'll come up short. You may love The Lobster or hate it, but either way, you won't forget it.",8,0,1,16 April 2019
Blade Runner 2049," A Beautiful Visual Feat
","Blade Runner. An 80's futuristic film noir that some filmgoers revere as one of the all-time great films.. with a caveat. Which of the endings did you see? The right one? or the really bad happy ending? Few films give the viewers their own personal ultimatum for the characters, but the first Blade Runner was that indecisive. So is it then, wise to give Blade Runner a 35 year old sequel/reboot? It apparently is. It turns out that Denis Villeneuve was destined to make it and truth be told, if you never saw the first Blade Runner, never fear. This is a film entirely of it's own.Blade Runner 2049 is the best looking film of the year. In terms of it's cinematography, it is a masterpiece. The production design brings us back to the incredible world that Ridley Scott introduced us to, but expands upon it exponentially. Our world is almost entirely replaced by holograms. 2049 focuses in on the idea of a society completely removed from humanity, where perfect virtual realities and artificial romances take the place of the human condition. Villeneuve and Roger Deakins work wonders on the ideas and the mis-en-scene that surrounds them. What we get is a film, though bloated in run time, fascinating from beginning to end. You will spend nearly three-hours in the theater, but entirely fixated on the image. You don't want to keep your eyes off of it. I know I didn't.",8,5,14,6 October 2017
First Man," Come Fly with Me
","'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'.Neil Armstrong did the impossible in 1969. As the U.S. and the Russians ran a cut-throat competition to see who could reach new imperial heights in outer space, it was Armstrong, Aldrin and all the good folks at NASA that took it upon themselves to wage an all-out, all costs battle to touch our lunar friend in the sky, plant our flag and mark it ours. They all did just that on July 20th, 1969 as millions of Americans sat in front of their TV sets and watched the first ever glimpses of the surface of our moon. Ever since, space travel has expanded and advanced to heights beyond our wildest dreams and to think there's an eternity left to be discovered. But the story of the moon landing has just as much to do with the man that Armstrong was as it does with the nation that let him pursue his remarkable journey. First Man is perhaps the most fitting cinematic memorial of one of the most incredible men that ever lived.Walking out of the screening, I kept thinking how impossible it was to imagine anyone having brought this film to life other than Damien Chazelle. If Whiplash was an excruciating assault of the senses detailing the teeth-nashing art of drumming, First Man is a sensory body blow that needs to be experienced on the largest screen possible and the loudest sound system you can find. Chazelle found a way to place us right there in the spacecraft. The shaking, the pounding, the soaring and the crashing into earth. I hear simulators on Earth can gives us near perfect space travel experiences, but the entire masterful opening sequence will suffice for me. I was clawing the back of my seat. It's a moment in film you'll never forget. Even more so is the final sequence on the moon. Armstrong exits the ship, and the soundtrack cuts out immediately. You take it all in. The miles of sediment leading to a black abyss. You look up, and there's Earth staring back at you. The only thing we see of Armstrong is the reflection on his helmet of what's in front of him. Apollo 13, eat your heart out for breakfast, lunch and dinner.In between the breathless, action-packed space travel sequences is an unexpected emotional journey into Armstrong's family life. The loss of his youngest daughter, and his wife, Janet, who begs him never to travel to the moon, out of certainty that he'd be gone soon after. Claire Foy is a powerhouse and steals the show as she corners the boys at NASA for a stern talking to. Never get in the way of the strong woman behind every great man. These scenes don't carry the effectual gravitas of the scenes in outer space, rather, they come across as home movies, complete with a shaky 16mm camera. Authenticity is what is being strived for here, and it sure accomplishes that. What is also not lost in First Man is Chazelle's ear for good music and how to utilize it powerfully. First Man is no musical, that's for certain, but throughout the film, little cues from scratchy records of the 1950's captures the tenderness of Neil and Janet, and the underlying love story that thematically bookends our experience.This is a story not just about accomplishment, but self pride and selfless love of those that are nearest to you. It's what keeps us all going, and it's comforting to know that it's what got Mr. Armstrong to the moon. This has been a long winded explanation in telling you all that First Man shouldn't be missed this season.",8,41,89,13 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Nothing Shaky About This
","Dan Trachtenberg and J.J. Abrams are either absolute geniuses, or contemptuous trolls. Because, by calling the film 10 Cloverfield Lane, they duped all of social media into thinking that this was a sequel to the 2008 found-footage monster movie, Cloverfield. Boy, did they get you all good. I'd give this a spoiler alert, but as a cinephile, I know better, and so should all of you. I sniffed out the 'hype' culture surrounding this film from the minute it dropped unexpectedly online.But a film being 'overhyped' is certainly not the same thing as a film being bad, disappointing, or even just O.K. 10 Cloverfield Lane turns out to be better than anyone thought it was going to be. This is a brilliant return-to-form for the psychological thriller genre. I was reminded the whole time of Misery. What I mean is, it's a film that freaks you out, without ever being gory and overly stylized. This film never jumps through hoops to scare you, and yet it's lack of effort scares you even more. Films like this used to be made much more often, but that was a time when films weren't made for profit. I guess that's the reason as to why they named it 10 Cloverfield Lane. They knew it was a great film, but they had to make sure it made money.. by attaching Cloverfield to it. Sure, it's lame, but at least a whole new audience can have a whole new appreciation for the psychological thriller!My praise goes straight to John Goodman. It feels like a decade since we last saw him on screen, or at least that's what it seems, because I'm wondering to myself, where has this guy been? He's one of the great actors. He is electrifying in this. He's a monster, and no, I don't mean the kind that destroyed Manhattan in the 2008 film. We never know what he's about, why he's so crazed, and how much he was fabricating the truth about the situation he put our main character in, but the film keeps us guessing. In the end, we aren't given all the answers, and neither were we given a 'gotcha' style ending, that would've left the audience howling, as expected. But that's the charm of this film. Sometimes, less is more, and less isn't at all what hype surrounding this movie wanted you to think. Yet, here we are, we all ended up seeing a great film, and that's all that matters.I left the theater pretty satisfied, and pretty entertained. Might I say, so far, 2016 has been an awesome year at the movies, and if it keeps up, I'm going to have a blast.",8,3,8,13 March 2016
War Dogs," This Gun Runs.
","After three Hangover films, two progressively worse than the first, and after another shift in the popularity of comedy films, you'd think that we had seen the last of Todd Phillips. But here he returns with War Dogs, a film that doesn't include Tigers in bathrooms, Mike Tyson karaoke, or men over the age of 40 waking up the next morning wondering what the hell they did the night before. This time, it's guns, ammo, drugs, the Iraq War, The Bush administration, fraud, corruption, greed and a group of violent Albanian mobsters. This is no laughing matter. This is Phillips' first attempt at making a truly serious film, while supplying his familiar style of dark comedy. But when you factor in the freeze-frame shots, the narrations, the soundtrack of classic rock tunes, the violence and the drugs, this film is nothing short of a love letter to Martin Scorsese. I kid you not, that's what this film is. Roll your eyes all you want, but it's a style of filmmaking that always works, especially when you're making something based on a true story. Paul Thomas Anderson did it with Boogie Nights, David O. Russell did it with American Hustle, Adam McKay did it with The Big Short.. and so on, and so on. I'll never dislike a movie that attempts to emulate Scorsese, no matter how blatant it could be. War Dogs succeeds with this formula, up to a certain point. When it comes to the political angle that the film takes, it wants you to believe that it's smarter than it actually is. It takes it's aim at the military industrial complex under Bush, but with the rise of a non- interventionalist foreign policy embraced by both parties, thanks to Trump and Sanders, this kind of subject is hardly daring. You're preaching to the converted, Todd. We all know that the Iraq War sucked. The edge is simply not there, but the performances and the writing make up for it. Teller and Hill have tremendous chemistry. They make believable brothers. Jonah Hill in particular is mesmerizing, creepy and totally hilarious. If this was a much better picture, you'd probably be hearing a lot of award buzz surrounding his performance. I really enjoyed Bradley Cooper's interesting bad-guy character. In short, it's a fairly entertaining, fairly long, and not too bad time at the movies, but it doesn't break any new ground, and it's nothing to rave about.",5,3,8,19 August 2016
It," We'll All Float On
","You'll float too.You'll be floating on air after seeing It. The creepiest, coolest film of 2017 so far. Easily, the most entertaining popcorn horror film in ages. Most of today's horror genre consists of dull jump-scare ghost movies and gnarly gore fests. It takes us back to the golden age of Horror, the 1980's. The film takes place sometime in 1989, complete with soundtrack and memorabilia. But the film itself could've easily been made in 89'. It's scary without being gratuitous. It's funny, without being a comedy. It's over-the-top, without being purposely terrible. It's got a standout cast of profane kids. Think of Stand By Me or The Goonies. You will sit back and smile away. You'll say to yourself 'If only every movie could be this way!'.Pennywise, while not played by the incomparable Tim Curry, is freighting in his new incarnation by Bill Skarsgard. This clown isn't a jokester. He's a shape shifting homicidal maniac and this time, that's a good thing. We have both versions and you can compare which one is superior if you wish, but you must concede that both are entirely different takes on the character and each stand on their own merits. The jump-scares all work here, which is something I don't usually say for horror movies. The creatures that Pennywise turns into are all terrifying and awe-inspiring. You may jump out of your seat, but you will appreciate the nuance.Seeing It in a large theater is also something you shouldn't go without doing. The audience reactions are priceless. The screams, the laughs, the shout outs! DON'T GO IN THERE! It was made to be a sheer crowd pleasure. An event of a movie and we sure are in need more of those.",9,3,5,22 September 2017
In Bruges," Pack your Bags
","Looks on the surface to be a typical English dark comedy/thriller in the vein of early Guy Ritchie. Watch it, and experience something absolutely phenomenal. I beg you, don't let this one pass you by. In Bruges is painfully hilarious, and painfully sad, at the exact same time. Imagine crying through your tears.. yeah, it pretty much sums this movie up. It uses it's criminal characters to observe the delicacy of life, and the excruciating consequence of one horrible mistake. Yet, these characters are so tragic, that when they go for a laugh, you're roaring. Laughter and sadness intertwine so well, isn't it a mystery why?",9,0,0,25 June 2015
Rocketman," Hold Me Closer
","I think it's going to be a long, long time before we see another biopic as whimsical, freeing, high-flying and visually spellbinding as Rocketman. Everything this movie is, ultimately, is what Bohemian Rhapsody should have been. A flamboyant whirlwind, so fitting of the wonderful, colorful world of Elton John. You couldn't have made it any other way. True, it's a bit unusual to be making a musical biopic about a man that hasn't died, but Elton has lived so many lifetimes and lives, it's hard to imagine him leaving us anytime soon.Rocketman is a tapestry of Elton's life from childhood to his troubled, but decadent adulthood. What is revealed is how miserable a life he truly had. Dealing with a father who was never truly there for him, and a love life filled with so many grifters, it seemed as though he was never going to fill the emptiness of his heart. Artistic brilliance truly comes from grief, as Elton pours his feelings out into every last song. Listening closely to the lyrics, and along with Dexter Fletcher's impeccable cinematic structure, we realize how many of these catchy, unforgettable tunes represented Elton's loneliness and longing. We also explore Elton's many unfortunate addictions. Drugs, sex and alcohol kept him at bay, until they nearly killed him. I got a kick out of how the film was crafted along the confines of an intervention, populated not only by Elton's many lovers, loved ones and acquaintances, but the many versions of himself.Not to mention, Rocketman is a jukebox musical on steroids. All the hits are here, and the entire cast has a swinging time performing them all. Shouldn't all musical biopics be like this? For my money, this is a nice change of pace from how formulaic and tiresome some biopics have become these days.",8,4,7,31 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Shining Stars
","Life has a funny way of making things happen. Such is the case with movies I was convinced I would never see. I was once convinced A Star is Born 2018 would be that instance. Firstly, I never saw the original 1930's classic and the two remakes that followed afterwards. Secondly, when the trailer surfaced, it reeked of Hollywood self-aggrandizement and schmaltz. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a musical romantic romp. Look at how beautiful they are compared to us slobs! Cinema lovers are sick of this game. They want something new. So imagine my surprise that the reviews turned up well above the 90% fresh rating on RT. Some of the most trusted names in the business even hailed it as one of the year's best. Could it be that Hollywood has found a way to make tired formulas relevant and exciting again? After all, I am many things, but a betting man I am not. I like to admit when I'm wrong. Cooper and Co. brought me into the reclining seats last night. Kudos to him for that.A Star is Born is, above all else, an aesthetically pleasing motion picture. It's shiny and beautiful without purposely doing so. It's sweet and sentimental without being condescending. It's sad, without becoming sappy. It was everything it needed to be to work, and It's a great thing that it does work. Bradley Cooper is a natural charm and practically loses himself as country music icon Jackson Maine. A fine study in method acting. I'm pleased to tell you that beyond looking like Cooper (at least after not shaving for a month), he's the farthest thing from a role we would expect to see him in. Jackson is a demon riddled, suffering alcoholic and we believe him. His muse, Ally, the Star of the picture is played by Lady Gaga herself. Or perhaps, we ought to refer to her in respect to her true person, Stafani Germanotta. A Star is truly Born as a pop superstar is taken apart from her wacky costumes, and returning to her roots as your average, beautiful Italian-American girl trying all she can to make it by and hopefully make it big. She is a dream come true and the precise reason to see this thing if you want to. To the unassuming eye, you couldn't tell that this is a role tailor made for Mama Monster. Does she properly fill the shoes of Streisand and Garland? You know, I think she does and I think she can be as big as the two of them put together.But granted these two very positive things, I wasn't knocked out of my socks at any given point of the film. It's beyond anything remotely grueling about a superstar celebrity vehicle, but don't expect a life-changing experience that leaves you talking about it for days after. This is just a satisfying, if not unforgettable, musical journey.",6,7,15,6 October 2018
The Death of Stalin," Russian Delusion
","A very funny, beautifully made satire about the fight for power in the Soviet Union following Stalin's death. It's a period piece that feel like a cross between Veep and Dr. Strangelove, with a humorous depiction of Russia's most ruthless dictator that rivals The Producers. A lot of the inside politics requires a background in the history of the USSR, but even people unfamiliar with that will still enjoy this. Buscemi, naturally, is the standout as Nikita Khrushchev. He speaks in his natural New York accent throughout, which makes his performance even funnier. If you need another reason to watch this, note that it's banned in Russia!",7,2,3,8 April 2020
Se7en," Holy Hell.
","Se7en is a morbid, unrelenting thriller. It doesn't merely stare into the abyss, it jumps in. Two detectives, one rookie and one veteran, come across the worst murders they've ever seen, but such that are intricately designed, they know the killer is trying to prove a point. Freeman's character connects the dots to the Seven Deadly Sins as inspiration for the killings. Once they catch him, they come to find that he's as crazy as you'd expect, but more self-righteous than they would ever believe, and all along, the religious backdrop of these murders were intentional.David Fincher is a master of the macabre and has become a household name for bleak films 23 years later. You can credit him for how deeply appalling the bloody crime scenes unfold for us. The little stories behind them, the production design.. Then we come to Kevin Spacey as the killer. Looking back now, it's a bit rich to see him play a man righteously outraged by a decaying American society and delivering his sick sense of street justice on sinners. Arguably, Spacey himself would have been among his victims. But perhaps even Spacey knows that, just as his character does here as well. Truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's horrifying.",8,1,1,26 December 2018
Unbreakable," Earth-shattering.
","M. Night Shymalan's reputation as a filmmaker has become tainted to say the very least. People chuckle at the mere mention of his name. After seeing the film Unbreakable, it doesn't feel like a joke any more. It now feels tragic. Unbreakable is a masterpiece. One of the best directed, best written and best shot films of the 2000's. I was hypnotized by the first frame. The cinematography is a work of art. The angles and techniques that Shymalan choses to tell this unique story propels it to a whole new level. The train sequence is fascinating in its use of what I call 'The Seat Dolly' to navigate through the dialogue. The POV of a young Glass looking at himself through a 1960's Television set is a truly powerful moment. Unbreakable through the visual language alone will take your breath away, and realize, there are ways to create a superhero epic than simply what Marvel has championed over the past 10 years. Is Unbreakable the greatest superhero movie? For my money, it is. It is the story of two men. One who can never be injured, and one who cant escape injury. By destiny, the two of them are spiritually connected. The reason we find is more Stan Lee-esque than we could ever imagine. This must have been a trip when it premiered 19 years ago, but it's even better and more poignant now than ever.",9,0,0,1 January 2019
Darkest Hour," Finest hour, in more ways than one.
","While Dunkirk was the WWII film that kept us on the battlefield and left us out of politics, Darkest Hour goes straight into the story of Churchill. Surely, a story for our times. Underestimated by the British elite, Churchill heard Nazis and fascists knocking on Britain's door. He led a bold charge to fight them with everything the nation had, instead of appeasing them to avoid conflict. 'We shall never surrender'. Churchill remains to be one of the most important men in human history. A man who helped saved Europe from the most cancerous evil's of it's society. Gary Oldman's portrayal is absolutely stirring and stunning. He is lost, under the most impeccable makeup artistry of the decade, as Churchill. This is the performance of 2017 to beat and nobody has done it yet. Cinematically, when the film breaks free from the dialogue laden scenes, the editing and cinematography guides us effectively through Churchill's world. An astonishing sequence involves Churchill commuting from the Underground and talking to the British working people on his way to deliver the big speech at parliament. You can feel the electricity, the hope and the righteousness among every player. For it was the people's thirst for vengeance that inspired him to lead the charge against Nazism with all of his might.We don't quite have a leader as fearless as Churchill these days, but what we do have is history that reminds us of what kind of leader he was. If not through the pages of a textbook, Darkest Hour should be shown in every classroom in America.",7,0,3,30 January 2018
This Is the End," The Funniest Comedy in an Awfully Long Time
","'This is the End' is one of those films that you'd expect to be funny, and somehow exceeds your expectations in ways you never imagined was possible. A movie that leaves you laughing so hard, your literally gasping for air. A movie you will quote for years, watch repeatedly and instantly refer to as one of your favorite movies. Believe it or not, 'This is the End' is THAT good. Its the Seth Rogen movie audiences have been waiting for since 'Pineapple Express', and the funniest one since 'Superbad'. In this day and age, its hard to make a comedy this memorable, since time and time again, the same jokes get recycled. But when you get out of the fictitious/formulaic/gross-out realm of comedy these days, there is an entirely different spectrum most comedies neglect. Satire. 'This is the End' is a comedy based on comedies. Never before has a comedy been this self aware of what it is, and rarely do actors ever be themselves just for the sake of laughs. In this case, it really does work. Every actor in the film plays a satirical version of his or herself. Seth Rogen is the pothead, Danny McBride is the creep, James Franco is the poser, Jonah Hill is the fake guy, Jay Baruchel is the shy one and Craig Robinson is the token black friend. They play their stereotypes to their advantage, and the fact that they are aware makes room for even more laughs. This holds true for the rest of the cast of comedic cameos, all except for Michael Cera. There's sort of a hilarious surprise with Michael Cera, but I don't want to ruin it in this review. Not only does the film work as a comedy, it also surprisingly works as a horror movie. There are plenty of jump scares and thrilling showdowns that awry during the course of this faux-apocalypse that will leave you on the edge of your seat and eagerly cackling with joy. There isn't much I want to discuss anymore, because a movie like this is better off seen to be believed. What can I say? Sit back, relax and get ready to laugh your ass off.",10,4,10,29 July 2013
Shaun of the Dead," A Bloody Good Time
","The first of the 'Cornetto' trilogy. Shaun of the Dead comedy takes it's cues from George A. Romero's zombie masterpieces, but primarily from Dawn of the Dead. The violence, the gore and even the biting (for a lack of a better term) social commentary. It just makes sense that when English humorists get their hands on this material, it would become sharper and funnier. Shaun of the Dead is pretty damn funny. Edgar Wright is the cinephile filmmaker of your dreams, because he knows his zombie movies, he knows that you know your zombie movies, and it all comes together in a great time all around. Have a pint and watch the whole thing blow over.",8,0,0,13 January 2019
Green Room," Punk Rock Horror
","Does Jeremy Saulnier have a thing with colors? First he gives us Blue Ruin, then he gave us Green Room. He's got a whole career ahead of him and I hope he covers every spectrum of the rainbow. But I digress. Green Room is good, but you need the stomach and patience to sit through it. Whereas Blue Ruin was brooding and violent, Green Room is less brooding and way more violent. The plot of the film is ingenious in it's own right. A punk band performs a gig at a skinhead compound and are held hostage in a night of terror. The band is in too deep. They've seen too much, and the skinheads want to do anything to bury the evidence, even if it means killing them all. Dark, dark, dark. Darkness consumes this movie. Either the subject matter begins to grow on you, or it doesn't. But I went with it, and for that, I wasn't disappointed. Also, kudos to Saulnier for casting Patrick Stewart and forcing him to cover up his English accent, with hilarious results.",7,1,2,25 March 2019
Us," This is US
","They say the greatest enemy that every one of us has is ourselves.America, this is your life. Us is Jordan Peele's second feature film as a horror auteur director after shocking and thrilling audiences two years ago with Get Out. The Jordan Peele many of us knew from MadTV and Key and Peele is no longer. He's evolved into a modern day John Carpenter, and damn it, we've needed one. This time, he cranks up the scares to 11 and leaves you squirming in your seats and then leaving the theatre with so many questions. Because, whereas Get Out was an obvious and straight forward satire on the crumbling facade of American race relations, Us is way more ambiguous with what it is trying to say. For that, Us is a strange, fascinating and wickedly cool film and something horror fans and just plain film fans will remember for a very long time.Santa Cruz. 1986. A little girl curiously ventures away from the boardwalk (now virtually guaranteed to be a Hollywood tourist attraction) and discovers an ominous fun house-of-mirrors right beside the beach. Inside, to her terror, she meets a sinister carbon copy of herself with a mischievous smile. Cut to 30 years later, the little girl is now a happily married mother of two, traveling with her family for a weekend getaway in Santa Cruz. Ho boy. Her family wants to go the same beach she did all those years ago. She cant bear to stomach it. She gives in and goes along with them, only for some very strange, sinister things to start happening to them all over again.Us inhabits a world of dualities. Or more specifically, every person in this movie has an evil version of themselves. The so-called 'untethered' that are out to vengefully take the place of their original host body. They are us, and we are them. They live underneath the human world, among multiplying rabbits. What is Peele trying to say? There isn't a definitive answer, but any of your best guesses is entirely possible. Is it a comment on self-loathing and the depression epidemic that has swept up so many in our generation? Is it a personified metaphor of the dark side that lurks within all of us? Is it's message more political (U.S.) regarding issues of class and social status? Is it a statement on America's violent upbringing? Or a satire on what is perceived to be normal and conformist in our society? Whatever your point of view may be, Us can conveniently be interpreted that way, and perhaps that was the entire point.This movie is fantastic and Jordan Peele is a born filmmaker. Lupita Nyong'o gives a breathtaking, terrifying performance. She is the actress to beat in 2019. I laughed, I cringed, I walked out with a big smile on my face. Us is for you, me, and everyone you know. See it.",9,14,29,31 March 2019
Knives Out," Knives Out Cuts Deep
","Knives Out isn't a Who Dunnit. It's a How Dunnit. It's a disassembled, deconstructed murder mystery that makes a mockery of the entire genre. Whatever you think is going to happen here, doesn't. That's fascinating. Rian Johnson is a really talented guy. I feared that this film was going to suffer cliches and lulls throughout, but not for a second was I not invested. I loved the convoluted nature of the mystery. The cast themselves help bring it all together. The standout is Daniel Craig in the most gloriously fun role he's ever delivered. It's hammy, it's over-the-top, but that's the point. He plays an old-school southern detective with an unorthodox knack for cracking completely absurd murder mysteries. He puts Sherlock Holmes to shame. The rest of the cast fires on all cylinders. This is the rare instance of an ensemble cast in which everyone compliments each other beautifully. I believe we'd go from a really good film to a great one with a trim of unnecessary dialogue. A few key pages of this scrip hint at a larger political message that doesn't materialize into anything meaningful, nor was it necessary. Some characters are seen, but seldom used, like Lakeith Stanfield as the lieutenant detective. But overall, this movie is nothing but fun.",8,5,12,1 December 2019
The Irishman," In the Still of the Night
","So, here we are. If you're reading this review, you've seen The Irishman. If you haven't seen it, you're not treating yourself to good cinema. 3 1/2 hours of it, and believe me, you'll be honored to have set aside that time to watch it all. Only one man in the history of the medium can make incredible films that last this long. The one and only. Marty. I love you. We all love you. You've had a hell of a run these past 50 years. It's not possible to have you around for another 50, but what more you can give to us in the years to come is enough.. and yet, The Irishman feels like your swan song. The end of lifetime of gangsters, guns, crime, incessant cursing and violence that splatters the silver screen ruby red with blood. There will never be another GoodFellas, period. It's an all-time masterpiece like few films ever made since. It's one of those rare perfect films. If you are expecting The Irishman to be as good as that, you're making a huge mistake going in. This is not that. Whereas GoodFellas is a flashy, frightening tale of the ugliest underbelly of the Italian mafia, The Irishman is a Greek tragedy of betrayal and regret. In other words, the antidote to all of that debauchery. A rational, thinking person's point of view as to what it means to be a criminal. Was it worth it? Can you be forgiven? Can you even live with yourself knowing you've spent your entire life as one? The Irishman, in no few words and no rushed time, tells you how hard it is to answer these questions.This is the story of Frank Sheeran. A WWII veteran and meat packer who gets involved with organized crime right from the very start. He provides a Philadelphia, Mafia owned restaurant with fresh cow's meat. When he is accused by the restaurant of stealing the meat from the delivery trucks, he solicits a Teamster attorney, Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano), to take up his case. Bufalino gets Sheeran off scott free. Dealing with wise guys, he's lucky he didn't lose his head. As Sheeran celebrates at another Philly restaurant, Bill introduces him to Russel Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the Don of the Philadelphia Italian Mafia. Frank and Russell hit it off. Russel appoints Frank to be his hitman. As they say in secret, he 'Paints Houses', and he's pretty good at it too. As a rising star in the Bufalino crime family, Russell eventually puts Frank in contact with a Bufalino associate and his personal friend. One Jimmy Hoffa, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Frank lands the biggest break he's ever gotten in his life. He's going to be Jimmy Hoffa's fixer and hitman. Well, he's sunk himself so low. There's nowhere else to go but up. Frank is in the big leagues, and that's just where his troubles begin.As Frank sinks deeper into the bog of the corrupt, violent power racket between The Bufalino crime family and Jimmy Hoffa, he realizes that his dual loyalties set him right in the middle of a growing war between the two. Hoffa isn't cooperating nicely with the fellow Teamsters, and Russell grows increasingly upset. Eventually, it all comes to a breaking point. Russell wants Jimmy Hoffa whacked. Internally, this becomes Frank's greatest challenge to date. Who's hitman does he want to become? Who's bridge is about to be burned? Moreover, does it even matter, since he's essentially sold his soul to two devils?Character is key here, and in terms of performances, this is the Three Amigos of the Mob Genre at their very best. De Niro is great as Frank Sheeran. Delivering his dialogue with a shaky stutter throughout. Uncharacteristic of the tough guys he's played in the past. Sheeran is almost a reluctant gangster. Pesci as Russell Bufalino is quiet and calculative. A striking departure from the volcanic hot heads Pesci is so famous for playing. He reaches Brando-esque heights, capturing intimidation through subtly. The star of the entire film, however, is Al Pacino. He's on fire as Jimmy Hoffa. As over-the-top and loud as Pacino gets, and yet, that works so well for the larger than life Hoffa. A legendary performance for a legendary man that, no disrespect, triumphs over Jack Nicholson's betrayal of him in Hoffa. Additionally, much has been made about Anna Paquin's portrayal of Frank's daughter. Specifically her lack of dialogue. That wasn't an afterthought, it was exactly the point. Frank's daughter's embarrassment and disgust at her father's actions is represented through silence. This is indicative of human nature. When someone you love disappoints you, you can't even bring yourself to look them in the eye, let alone say a word to them. Scorsese brilliantly understands that, and Paquin delivers her silent portrayal powerfully. She's an unsung hero of the entire film.The Irishman is a book in three incredibly long chapters. That being: Power, Betrayal and Regret, in that order. In Power, we see Frank's rise to Wise Guy glory, from the streets of Philly to the trenches of Washington D.C. We see how deep the rot of corruption truly is through the eyes of Jimmy Hoffa. Using the Mafia at his beckon call to get rid of anyone who gets in his way. Even going so far as rigging the 1960 Presidential election in John F. Kennedy's favor... which in all honesty, eh, take that with a grain of salt. In Betrayal, we witness Frank's fall, in which he agrees to deliver the biggest/worst hit of his life. In Regret, we see Frank at rock bottom as he crawls on broken glass for his daughter's forgiveness. Scorsese gracefully weaves his behemoth of a story through these chapters. The runtime itself gives enough breathing room for us to digest every last action and breaths these characters take. Everything down to the last facial expression is crucial to what tells the story. It feels like it's in real time, but it's riveting all the while. In film history, this is truly unprecedented. We are getting greatness, and nothing less.Two moments stand out in my mind that define how great of a film The Irishman is. One, is the half-hour that builds up to the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa by Frank Sheeran. The climax. Truthfully, It's one of the best pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen. Scorsese, amazingly, captures the most agonizing moment in Frank Sheeran's life in slow-motion. Or at least, that's how it felt. It's embarrassing, cringe-inducing and painful to watch. We feel virtually all of it. A slow dreadful death march, essentially. In other mob films, it feels like a sucker-punch to the teeth when someone gets whacked. Not here. This one in particular arrives as real as death itself. Slowly and inevitably. The other moment is the final scene. Frank spends this last chapter of his life seeking a sense of closure that he never gets. Everybody is gone. A priest absolves him of his sins, and leaves him to rest for the night. Frank tells the priest to leave the door cracked for him before he goes. There it is. The final shot. Frank, all alone, with nothing but a crack in the door to comfort him. Instantly iconic. In that tender moment, we realize that it's all too late for Frank. He's made his peace with God, but to what avail? He's hurt every person in his life. He's left to die, alone. A lifetime, wasted.My only gripe with The Irishman is that it was released on Netflix. Now that's a waste. This film demands to be seen in a theater, on a large screen, with a crowd of adoring cinephiles to clamor out of the theatre to discuss this in length when the credits roll. It's the best film of 2019. As far as the de-aging technology is concerned, it looks good for how infantile technology is at this moment. I'd suggest you not be too hung up on it. It doesn't damper the experience, neither does it comprise the story.",10,9,18,2 December 2019
Batman Returns," A Waddler
","When the Penguin and Catwoman are on screen, it's very entertaining. When Tim Burton lets loose with his wacky interpretation of the Penguin's layer, it's completely absurd and embarrassing. The ice is plastic and starts shaking halfway through the film. The penguins wear jetpacks. What a cringe-fest.",5,15,23,11 April 2017
Spotlight," All the Archdiocese's Men
","The front-runner for Best Original Screenplay in just about every award show this year is Spotlight. the riveting, frighteningly accurate story about the cover-up and exposure of the pedophilia scandal that nearly destroyed the Catholic Church during the 2000's. As the statistic was at that time, nearly 6% off all catholic priests in the world were accused of sexual assault. Yes, it's far too painful to want to believe, but this is true. A noticeable amount Catholic priests were guilty of this, and many more may exist to this day. The truth is, these things happened, and the Church did next to nothing to stop it. It caused many people, like myself, to become lapsed Catholics, and some became not religious at all. Thus, Spotlight, a film about journalism, is a microcosm of journalism in itself. It's the truth that you don't want to hear, but you really should hear. Tom McCarthy brings the story to life with an unbeatable cast. The standout star is Mark Ruffalo, who in this, gives a raging monologue that has easily sealed him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The best scenes are, without a doubt, the interviews with the survivors. You'll be left stunned, that's all I have to say right now. There's not a moment of drag in this picture. Spotlight hooks you in to the very last frame. It's screenplay is the heart of it all. It reaffirms you how intelligent a film can truly be. If this doesn't win any awards for Best Original Screenplay in the coming season, I'd be flabbergasted. Spotlight absolutely delivers as an engaging drama, a loud advocate of free speech and a relentless call for criminal justice everywhere.",9,2,6,23 November 2015
Concussion," Skip this.
","The subject of the film is fascinating. The discovery of CTE, it's devastating impact on football players, and the horrible response by the NFL makes for what could be a great biopic. This is a total bore. Milk toast cinema, folks. I felt like I was watching a 2-hour Lifetime movie. I should've known. Will Smith should've been the first warning. He never headlines good movies anymore. Some people are hailing it his best performance, but that distinction must still go to The Pursuit of Happiness. He was absolutely the best part of this movie, but even in a few parts, you see him trying very hard for a film that isn't trying to do anything at all. The writing, the cinematography, the flow of the story.. amateur hour at best. I'm disappointed.",3,10,21,3 January 2016
Deadpool 2," Superhero Laughs
","Deadpool is back. This time, he's got a far greater arsenal of jokes than guns and nunchucks. Deadpool 2 is more manic, more in-your-face and more outrageous than it's predecessor. It's exactly the kind of sequel you thought it would be. What does it all amount to? A time at the movies that leaves you rocking in your seats till the credits roll. But the jokes come flying at you so fiercely, it's noticeable which one stick from which ones that fall completely flat. Yes, most of the jokes hit hard and left me howling. From unsubtle jabs at the X-Men franchise, to baby legs, to an impressive diagetic use of showtunes, to a vicious roast of Ryan Reynold's cinematic decisions. Deadpool 2, is Deadpool in and of itself. It doesn't really care. It's lovable in that respect. Along with the fun is Josh Brolin who makes a welcomed addition to the team as Cable. Plus, an X-Men cameo many will be thrilled to see.. and no, it's definitely not Wolverine.",7,1,3,18 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Valhalla, I'm Coming!
","Marvel, how do you do it? You make movies that this superhero/comic book illiterate will go see. Not only that, but you made a Thor movie that really got my attention in the coming attractions. I used to think Thor was one of the more serious and boring Marvel films. I once caught the first film on a flight home somewhere and I totally slept through it. Well, out of nowhere comes Ragnarok, which injects serious comedic energy through the veins of the franchise. This is a goofy, funny little acting flick. Not so different from Guardians of the Galaxy, in fact. It takes itself so lightly and I was thrilled to see that. Comic book movies shouldn't be so gritty. Thor and Hulk romp on the screen like a reboot of Lethal Weapon. Jeff Goldblum is here and he's fantastic... as Jeff Goldblum. Let's face it, we wouldn't want him any other way. Cate Blanchett is dynamite. The beauty of this, as with most Marvel movies is that you will have a great time, regardless if you're familiar with the comic books or not.",7,10,18,8 November 2017
The Hateful Eight," A Fistful of Tarantino
","Western, racist, Bloody beyond belief, disjointed in narrative, crackling on 70MM film and complete with an incredible soundtrack from the master Ennio Morricone. What else did you expect from Quentin Tarantino?My friends, he's done it again. The Hateful Eight is something you absolutely can't miss. This is the western that Tarantino has waited his entire life to make, and boy, does he let you know it. Without spoiling it, it's Reservoir Dogs in the old west, with a murder-mystery that would leave the makers of Clue green with envy. Every performance is heavily committed and excellent. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a crazed wonder, and she nearly stole the movie for me. In 70MM, it looked stunning. I'm sad that it only was a roadshow, I miss film dearly.It made me laugh, it made me gasp and it made me squirm. Once you see it, you won't be able to stop talking about it. What a spectacular season to see this and Star Wars playing at the same time. The movies aren't dead, man.",9,16,45,30 December 2015
"I, Tonya"," Going for the Gold
","'The haters always say, Tonya tell the truth! There's no such thing as truth.'What is the truth? Is it what we hear about through other sources (gossip, the press, television, social media) or is it only what we want the truth to be? 'I, Tonya' takes on the controversial true story of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and the violent figure skating mele that shocked the nation 24 years ago this month. But despite the age gap, 'I, Tonya' is a film for our times. The complicated insanity of this particular story mirrors so much of what we've been living through in this country lately. A time of anxiety, fear and paranoia of who to trust, what is right from wrong and what on earth is about to come next.You would think, in that sense, that 'I, Tonya' would make a mockery of Tonya Harding. You would think that Hollywood would portray her as a piece of white trash from fly-over-country who got everything she deserved. We love to do this to each other. We enjoy a gladiator show of reaffirming our popular views in the court of public opinion. But 'I, Tonya' chooses not to go down that path. Instead, it chooses an area just as problematic.. siding with Tonya Harding. Based on what we know about the case from the initial news reports, it isn't wise for any critical thinker to take Harding's word for what actually happened. We will never know for sure if she was an accomplice in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan or not. She was, at the very least, complicit in Jeff Gillooly's bungled attempt at sabotage. But in the end, does all of this really matter? Did we as viewers find it problematic that GoodFellas was based on Henry Hill's account of his time in the Mafia? Did we find it unsettling as Boogie Nights recounted the awful story of the Wonderland murders and the tragedy of pornstar John Holmes? We all did, but those are two great films. I, Tonya is a great film. I adored every last frame of this film. It is precisely the kind of energy and inspiration that keeps me going to the movies. Fearless, powerful, raw and most importantly, real. Craig Gillespie holds nothing back. Steven Roger's amazing screenplay doesn't mince words. By far and beyond, it is the best edited film of 2017. Clearly reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker. The icing on the cake are the performances. Margot Robbie is electrifying as Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan plays the utterly despicable Jeff Gillooly perfectly. A soft spoken dummy and a wife beater. His portly companion Shawn Eckhardt (played by Paul Walter Hauser) is a full-on riot. The worst hitman in human history. A conspiracy nut who orchestrated an international incident from his parent's house and willingly exposed himself to the FBI. You could only find this kind of stupid in America. The role that everyone is talking about is Allison Janey's shocking portray of Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden. A commanding on-screen performance for the ages. She's a horrifying cross between Nurse Ratched and Terence Fletcher. Sometimes, the film plays up a lot of the abuse that Tonya took from Golden and Gillooly, much of it violent. It is more matter of fact, than funny. At times, it's painful to sit through. But then two seconds later, you are laughing at a funny quip from any of the characters on screen. This is real life. It's horrifying, it's funny, it's absurd. Take the trip and you will love it as much as I did.",9,2,3,13 January 2018
Crash," Best Picture?
","Crash is an exercise of self-aggrandizement and hollow morality. It wants to be something so edgy and different, yet profound. To put it in another way, Crash thinks its woke. Like, super woke. In reality, it's in a coma. It's message is irreparably bungled.Everyone in this movie is a racist. The cop, the actor, the criminal, the district attorney and his wife, the shop keeper, et al. Their racism, so to say, is unrealistically performed. How overt racism is in our society depends on certain discrepancies such as wealth and intelligence (though, not always mutually exclusive to that). Here, everyone and is an out and out bigot, and proud to be one at that. To that effect, we aren't emotionally invested in anything that's happening onscreen. It's hard to take any of these characters seriously when they all sound like Archie Bunker.Which makes the film's most significant moments all the more perplexing. For two scenes in particular, Crash suddenly becomes a riveting, deeply moving drama. The car crash rescue scene comes to mind. In this moment, the film explores the complexities of humanity when a predator cop, who sexually assaults Thandie Newton's character in another scene, comes to her rescue in a fiery car crash that nearly takes her life. The confusion, disgust and desperation that Thandie Newton conveys here is a truly incredible acting feat. This scene alone nearly redeems Crash in every capacity. Crash, in the end, would have worked much better as a slice of life ensemble piece, similar to Magnolia.
It doesn't work as a film about race. Not even a little bit. Should you want to watch a better film on that topic, Do The Right Thing does the trick every time.",4,3,5,5 April 2020
Snatch," Yeah, Don't go to England.
","Wow, this movie is so much fun. I loved it. It's a better film than LS2SB, in my opinion. It's faster, funnier, crazier, smarter and tighter. None of the characters seemed conventional this time around. Ritchie takes the formula he used in his first film, and creates new, hilarious angles on them. Creativity wins in the end. We follow two mob groups, and they all intersect and scrap up within the final act of the film. There's boxing, and jewel thievery, and everyone trying to get the job done without being fed to hungry pigs (literally). While his last film was a tribute to Tarantino, this film, to me, seems like a parody of him. It works better, knowing that conventions are being made fun of, in cool ways.",8,0,2,25 June 2015
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Shave and a Haircut.
","Tim Burton and I have a rough past. I've admired some of his dark/quirky films that spark from the most creative of places (Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride), while I've thoroughly detested some of the others (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland). He's a director who's unique touch hasn't always hit the mark. But Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a career high point. It is his bloodiest, darkest film to date and it is nearly his best. If you've noticed, my soft spot for musicals continues.. I honestly can't explain. Adapting from Steven Sondheim's genius Broadway creation, Sweeny Todd comes alive. Johnny Depp is electric. His performance here is tied with his portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson as his all-time best. He was born to sing, quite frankly. All of the others shine from Carter, to Cohen to the late Alan Rickman. The lyrics shake you to the core and the imagery shocks you as it cascades in blood. Sweeney Todd is a cut above the rest (rimshot).",8,1,2,8 September 2017
Black Mass," Battle of the Bulger
","As a man who knows his crime movies, I was very stoked to see this. The advertising campaign made this movie look like the cinematic event of year. Everyone got so excited, that they got disappointed when they realized that it wasn't another Goodfellas. Let's be honest, how many movies are? It was really never meant to be in the first place. The Whitey Bulger story is something much slower, creepier and slimier. Black Mass is the Whitey Bulger story, as it really went down. With everything considered, it is nothing short of a great crime movie. At the center of it all is a tour-de-force performance by Johnny Depp. It's the best performance he's done in more than a decade. He has the Best Actor nominations on lock. Every time he is on screen, you cannot keep your eyes off of him. He's fascinating, and yet absolutely revolting. Other than Depp, we have a so-so performance by Joel Edgarton, and a surprisingly stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger. It's as violent as any great gangster movie, and just as well shot. I think it's not to be missed, as long as you remind yourself that this isn't going to be Scorsese.",8,2,3,10 October 2015
Suicide Squad," ..and I thought my jokes were bad.
","The summer movie season has hedged it's bets on Suicide Squad as being the biggest, baddest film of them all. If ever there was a perfect formula for a summer hit, this was the one. A gritty DC movie, with Margot Robbie, a kick ass soundtrack, and the cinematic return of the Joker.. a character audiences have become entranced with since Heath Ledger's frightening portrayal just shy of a decade ago. It's the kind of film that generates hype and anticipation, even from a non- superhero lover as myself. Hollywood has found an angle to attract almost all audiences to this genre with films like this. I couldn't wait to see it.Suicide Squad, in reality, was an act of brilliant advertising. The film is a hot mess. The plot is entirely incoherent. More than once, I wasn't sure whether to burst out laughing, or sit in silence. I had no idea where this film was coming from. It's funny... at least when the characters want to be.. but Will Smith utters one line during the climax that almost made me fall out of my chair, and I know that wasn't the script's intention. When the film wants to be gritty, it comes across as desperate. Almost clinging to hope that they can capture the same genius as The Dark Knight. The soundtrack is fantastic, but it disappeared after the first act, perhaps they ran out of money to license it.The single worst aspect of the film was the villain, Enchantress. In a movie sold upon gritty DC misfits and the Joker, the film itself centers on a evil voodoo ghost woman thing that shimmies about and creates an army of mutant mud monsters to kill everything in sight, all the while promising the protagonists a false spell that will give them a domesticated family life that they always wanted. Now, If I told you all of this in the months prior to the release of the film, you'd call me insane. But yes, Enchantress makes up about 60% of the film, and you will be as speechless as I was watching this. At one point, I thought I was watching the sequel to Fantastic Four.But are there any positives? Yes, there are. This is far from an unwatchable film. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is a feat of casting genius. She was my favorite part. She is the best portrayal Harley Quinn since Arleen Sorkin voiced her in Batman: The Animated Series. Hilarious, sexy, spunky, badass.. It reminds you why we all love that crazy gal. Jared Leto's Joker is another thing that impressed me. He took the character in a direction that was quite new and quite familiar. To sum it up, it was a combination of Jack Nicholson's grandstanding Joker from the Tim Burton Batman, with Heath Ledger's Joker, plus a tiny hint of Mark Hamill's animated Joker. He's insanely creepy, he never breaks character (much like Ledger), and it works very well. It was a given that he would never in a million years reach the heights of Ledger, but this was a Joker that should be well appreciated for years to come. I suggest, if there ever is a live-acting Killing Joke movie, WHICH THERE TOTALLY SHOULD BE, cast Leto immediately.Other than that, Suicide Squad is a major disappointment. For what we were all expecting, and we were all expecting so much.. maybe this should've been a lesson to all of us.. just don't hype a movie. Scratch that, just don't hype a DC Cinematic Universe movie. You will always be disappointed.",4,2,4,13 August 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Paint It Black
","Believe it or not, this was considered a flop and a disappointment for Stanley Kubrick back in 1987. Many of his fans were expecting a war epic along the lines of Apocalypse Now. But the thing is, Kubrick already made his war epic, in Paths of Glory. Secondly, it's clear by watching the film that Kubrick's intention was not to talk about the politics of the war, or even stage big budgeted action sequences. His goal was to encapsulate the overall feeling many had about the Vietnam War on and off the battlefield. A pointless exercise of human slaughter. Vietnam, for many, was the definition of man's inhumanity to man. That is what Full Metal Jacket is truly about. The unforgettable first 45 minutes of the picture has us see the ways in which these soldiers are desensitized. The loud-mouthed, profane Sgt. Hartman humiliates the new recruits to their core and as a result, mentally destroys the most vulnerable of the recruits in Leonard 'Private Pyle' Lawrence. Once we enter Vietnam, Kubrick shows us the casualties of war, and man's inability to show humility towards each other. In the end, Vietnam is a killing field and some of those fighting it ultimately enjoyed the killing. Full Metal Jacket doesn't resolve like a novel, nor do any of the characters receive any kind of redemption. You can say that it's in the tradition of all of Kubrick's films.",9,2,3,8 November 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," American Gothic
","'Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness.' - MLK Jr.It is perhaps the most sentient lesson one can take from Three Billboards Outsie Ebbing, Missouri. The darkest film of 2017. A film so unrelentingly angry and brutal, that it laughs in self-awareness and asks the audience to do the same. Not a single person in this film is likable, by any stretch. Not a single line of dialogue is delivered with the premise of you bursting out laughing. Three Billboards is what it is. Unapologetically politically incorrect and gritty. Martin McDonagh piles it all on high like a plate at Thanksgiving dinner (to make a timely reference). But consequently, it gives the film a charm of it's own and a poignancy that is unmistakable. Reminiscent of the great films of the Coen Bros. and Quentin Tarantino, Three Billboards takes itself as far as it can go down the dark comedy rabbit hole and you will be smitten by that instantly. Three Billboards is a remarkable film and the most memorable film I've seen this year.Frances McDormand, in what can only be described as her most commanding on-screen performance since Fargo, plays Mildred Hayes. The grieving, blisteringly vengeful mother of a young girl raped and murdered by an unknown psychopath. In righteous indignation, she rents out Three billboards, that just so happen to be outside of Ebbing, Missouri (as the title suggests), that bluntly criticize the police department of Ebbing for what she sees as incompetence. 'Raped while dying,' 'And still no arrests,' 'How come, Chief Willoughby?' they read. Chief Willoughby, played by Woody Harrelson, takes offense by the billboards as he feels it unfairly targets him, especially coming on the heels of his cancer diagnosis. Backed up in outraged is Officer Jason Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell, in a role that seems tailor made for a young Michael Rooker . Officer Dixon is the world's stupidest cop and the most bigoted for sure. As time goes on, the outrage comes to ahead when a new specific tragedy (that I won't spoil) happens to Chief Willoughby. Defiant, Mildred insists that the billboards stay up. The tables have turned for Dixon, who now has a righteous anger of his own. Desperate for revenge, he tries to get back at Mildred, only to reap what he has sowed, by chance, in a Molotov cocktail attack on the police station. Also, by sheer chance, he runs into who he thinks is the killer of Mildred's daughter and to atone for his bad cops sins, tries his best to indite the SOB.What is this movie getting at? A simple tale of the madness of current American society at it's core. Nobody is ever who they seem and we all aren't perfect. Also, how fate can change lives and the perspectives of themselves and others on a dime. Furthermore, tragedy and hate tend to become vicious cycles, as we all like to blame some kind of scapegoat to heal ourselves. It never does. Three Billboards cuts deep, even as it takes itself not very seriously... or so we think? The characters all curse up a storm and beat each other up, yet they all cry real tears. Can a film this strange make you feel the feels? The answer is it does. By some miracle, it does.",9,5,10,21 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," O.K. Boomer.
","Let's just call it Star Wars: Let's Wrap this Up. Say what you will about the last two in the saga, but they had clear, investing stories to tell. To all of those who said that The Last Jedi sucked so hard, hope you enjoy this one, because it was tailor made for you. It plays it safe on every level. It's character development, suffice to say, are hackneyed. Big revelations are presented here that were meant to last a huge impact on the audience, and yet they don't. They sit there. Because at this point, who cares? I didn't hate it. I'm not as emotionally invested in the franchise as many are, so I could find little things to enjoy about this. 2019 was an incredible year for film, but ironically, it produced a wimpy Star Wars installment. But to be sure, I'll take this one over those wretched prequels any day of the week.",5,3,13,22 December 2019
American Sniper," This Means War
","The most controversial, sought after, talked-about movie of the past year has been American Sniper. It excited self-proclaimed patriots, annoyed the PC gestapo, and beat Spongebob at the box-office. So what is the big deal? Because all those who've seen it will tell you the same thing, it's an excellent movie. This thing is not going to leave my mind for a few days. Clint Eastwood, you're a hell of a director. He managed to get inside the mind of America's most lethal sniper, and show to us his demons. To those who sit there and think that it's a thankless, cowardly job, I'd ask you to kindly get your head from out of your ass. Chris Kyle is no saint, but he saved many of his fellow men, and protected his country. But in the process, he made many, terrible mistakes. Eastwood, I thought absolutely made sure not to make this movie a gung-ho, get-some, merica' love fest. It's just real life. The war scenes are some of the best ever filmed, and hold absolutely nothing back. But, it's everything outside the battlefield that will surely haunt you. Here, we have a transformation of a Texas good-old boy, to an empty vessel staring into the abyss. War is a drug. Chris Kyle was a war junkie. Everyone tries to bring him back home, but time and again, he goes back to the desert. Each time, little by little, his soul is sucked from his body. By the end, just when you think he's been home long enough to have recovered, well.. we all know what happened. If there's anything to criticize about this movie, it's the time it spent glossing over Kyle's work for veterans at home. That scene with the veterans is great, but it goes way too quick. Also, let us not forget the fake-baby. Folks, we aren't looking at a perfect movie.. but by God is it close. It's an ice-cold slice of americana. The quintessential movie to those who are serving, and those who have served our country.",9,12,16,25 September 2015
Southpaw," A Heavyweight Champion.
","Southpaw is a bloody good time. It's 'Rocky' meets '8 Mile'. OK, you can see every plot point and boxing-movie cliché from a mile away. But does it matter when such energy pumps through your veins as you're watching the big redemption fight. You're rooting for Billy Hope all the way, and you feel for him when he falls, big time. Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't give a spectacular performance as per his pedigree, but he makes Billy Hope come alive. The role was originally intended for Eminem, and you can see Gyllenhaal channel him in every last nuance of his performance. Had Eminem taken the role, we'd be talking about his performance for years. Other performances are worth mentioning. Forrest Whitaker does a great job as the 'cranky old gym trainer', and Rachel McAdams soars as Maureen Hope. Not to mention, Oona Laurence, turning in a magnificent performance as Leila. Southpaw doesn't pack the punch of what you'd might expect in the award show category, but it's a popcorn, sports flick that will entertain you, and that's enough.",6,4,8,3 August 2015
American Hustle," This movie is no con.
","American Hustle tilts its head high and proud to lead the pack of ambitious, brilliant movies of 2013 to their fate on Oscar night. But why does American Hustle feel so highly of itself? and why does it seem even more likely that David O. Russel has created his cinematic magnum opus? The answer is, he just did. American Hustle is without a shadow of a doubt the best picture that David O. Russel could ever make, and that says a whole lot due to the caliber of excellence already under his belt. Its a sprawling epic of a crime movie that hearkens back to some of the greatest cinematic techniques utilized by Scorsese and Altman. Its a brilliant screenplay of sorts that only increases with cultural flair and dramatic tension with every frame. Its easy to really pin down the plot of the film since this certainly isn't the first time a movie has been made about successful and or unsuccessful con men in the midst of their 'crime of the century'. But what makes this movie shine the most is its performances, which are without a doubt the greatest of the year, or any year. Christian Bale is absolutely flawless. I want to say its his greatest, but movies like The Fighter and American Psycho challenge that theory.. and perhaps this role simply didn't trump those roles. But I think we can agree, it stands proudly among the two aforementioned roles. Amy Adams is captivating as a ferociously sexy redhead with an insatiable appetite for conning the people she holds closest to her. Jennifer Lawrence soars as the dimwitted wife of Christian Bale who just about ruins every possible chance of keeping this highly secretive con successful. But it was Bradley Cooper who shines the brightest in this masterpiece. This is the greatest role of his career. You could guarantee that this will bring him home an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He's simply unbelievable as an unnervingly demented crooked cop on the verge of a mental breakdown. American Hustle is an American treasure. That being said, I think it absolutely has a lock on many Oscars on Oscar night. However, so does Four Years a Slave. Regardless, do not miss your chance of seeing this film in the theater.",9,24,45,28 December 2013
Nightcrawler," The Freaks Come out at Night
","I'm kicking myself for having missed this in 2014. Nightcrawler is such a deliciously creepy movie, and an absolutely hypnotizing experience. From the minute we first meet Louis Bloom, like the car-wrecks he captures on video, we can't keep our eye's off of him. He has a frightening quality to him, that doesn't require raising his voice, or resorting to violence. He's a maniac, in that, he's just too dedicated to such a disgusting craft. We see him descend deeper into the abyss of his scummy news job, by sacrificing his humanity in order to get the money shot for the 5am News cycle. Dan Gilroy unravels this character, and the world that surrounds him in an astoundingly twisted way, matched with Robert Elswit's always spellbinding cinematography. This is a film that grips you tight and holds your attention hostage until the credits roll. What's even better than the experience itself, is the impression it leaves on the News media. To many a news reporter, Louis Bloom is an inspiration. Yet to the rest of us, he's an insufferable lunatic. I loved it.",9,0,1,16 June 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Killer Queen or Killing Queen?
","Every kid who has ever had trouble fitting in has someone that inspires them. Someone to show them what it is like to be fearless, strong and bearing all of your soul stark naked for the world the see. That man was Freddie Mercury for me. I was a Queen superfan in my youth, and that says a lot for a band that had lost it's lead singer long before my time. Their music spoke to me. Rocked me to my core. Made my heart sing. Bohemian Rhapsody remains one of my favorite songs of all time. Passion, joy, rage and sorrow in under 6 minutes, and to think it was ever considered a critical flop. A Freddie Mercury biopic was decade in the making, and foundered in development hell as the surviving band members fought tooth and claw against showing the darkest portions of Mercury's life. The band ultimately had the final say. What we get instead is the fluffiest tribute to one of the greatest bands of all time. Fluff is all we've got to work with here, and quite frankly, it's disappointing.Bohemian Rhapsody spands Freddie and his career with Queen from the band's conception to the insane making of 'A Night at the Opera', to the lull's of the 1980s, to the final scene which captures Freddie's greatest performance ever at Live Aid. That scene in particular is a masterful tribute that almost redeemed BH of all of it's numerous flaws. The entire performance is covered. Every movement, every facial expression, every audience reaction. Singer wants us to live this moment. We don't cut back and forth quickly around it. We stay with it. It needs to be experienced in a loud, large theatre without a doubt. But if we're going to compare the biography portion of the film, consider this familiar territory the entire way through. If you've seen Ray, Walk the Line, Get On Up, Jersey Boys, Love & Mercy, The Doors and Straight out of Compton, you've sadly seen Bohemian Rhapsody. However, where Love & Mercy and The Doors entire the mad darkness from which these great songs were inspired, we barely see that side of Mercury being explored. Neither do we see in depth his extricating struggle with his sexuality and his later crippling AIDS diagnosis. Both are hinted at, but none of the execution truly captured his pain. Again, this is disappointing.See Bohemian Rhapsody for the music if nothing else. You'll love hearing the old songs in crystal clear, loud quality. But don't expect a masterpiece.",6,6,9,6 November 2018
Bird Box," Seeing is Believing.
","Behold, the most talked about film of 2018, appearing right at the tail-end, that has flooded your internet screens with memes and steaming hot takes. We've been in this new era of streaming cinema for a few years, but I've never seen a streamable film become such a phenomenon so quickly as Bird Box has. I barely new this film existed a week ago, by the end of the week, it was in my face everywhere. Perhaps it's because of it's mass availability. Perhaps it's because it's truly a groundbreaking horror classic we all didn't see coming. Perhaps it's because Sandra Bullock is so good in this, she's gotten herself into an instant comeback. Perhaps it's all of the above. Or... here me out.. perhaps it's all just hype. But you know what, I watched it to. I submitted, I succumbed, I jumped right into the fray and turned on Bird Box. I hand it to Netflix and nearly everyone involved in the making of Bird Box for bringing everyone to the table and tuning into the show. So much so that it's now being reported that 45 million subscribers streamed Bird Box within the first week of it's release. That's not a smash-hit, that's a gold mine.In the end, Bird Box is truly, unfortunately, just hype. A B-Grade horror movie with a nice little gimmick. But it just doesn't try anything new, nor does it utilize the power of cinema in the profound, horrifying ways we all know it can be used. Many are describing it as A Quiet Place, but replacing noise with sight. A succinct description of Bird Box, and it's correct. But here is the catch, if you must limit a sense, you must enhance others, and you must present excruciating challenges that one must face in eliminating an entire sense, vital to the human condition. Bird Box should be mind-blowing, and yet it settles. It takes the easiest way out. If you've seen any generic Horror movie, you've seen Bird Box. Maybe not with the same budget and high-end actors as Bird Box, but you've seen this movie already nonetheless.A terrifying virus is sweeping the entire civilized world, and it just stepped foot in America. An epidemic of sudden mass suicides. You've heard of the living undead, try the living 'wish I was' dead. But these folks don't need Prozac. No, their longing for death comes from a more mystical source. A fantastical being, said to be so beautiful, it makes life itself unbearable. Thankfully, we never get to see what this being is. Chances are, if we did, we'd all be reaching for a blindfold to put on. Malorie Hayes (Bullock), a single mother who never asked or deserved any of this is put to to the test as she loses her sister to the being and seeks shelter in a 'half-way house' of perfect strangers all looking to survive and keep their virgin eyes unscathed. It's all a matter of who isn't stupid or unlucky enough to die first. Malorie, through sheer badassery, makes it far enough to protect herself and two newborn children, out of sight and out of mind, so to say.I wish I was scared. I wish this movie gripped me. But instead of praying on our own worst fears (which is what the world's greatest horror movies have ever done) Bird Box takes a terrifying dilemma, and only shows us one dimension. One by one, we see the characters fall victim to the accursed sight, but the viewer doesn't feel it with them. It was as though we all were under the blindfold. An emotional, empathetic blindfold. The dialogue is cheesy. Indistinguishable from a Sci-Fy channel variety Horror movie. The cinematography does it's thing and at time works, but it never goes far enough. Props to the performances by Bullock, Sarah Paulson and even John Malkovich. They were as serious and committed as they should have been to this material. But nothing ever comes together. It's a bit disheartening.For many, seeing is believing, and most Netflix users have and will see Bird Box. If nothing else, a phenomenon can be worth participating in as a cultural experience. Even if the experience leaves much to be desired.",5,0,5,31 December 2018
Burn After Reading," Read Em' and Weep.
","Though most Coen Bros. films skirt a fine line between reality and fantasy, this is the only film in their ranks that is so inexplicable and stupid, it must be a true American crime story. Burn After Reading details what happens when you give absolute idiots classified information. The Coens needed the perfect oddball cast, and they got one. John Malkovich is easily the standout favorite of mine. A disgruntled ex-CIA agent with the dirty mouth of a truck driver and a lethal temper. He's phenomenal. Frances McDormand shines here as a middle-of-the-road dolt who only cares about plastic surgery. George Clooney is just George Clooney, but I got a kick out of his patented sex- machine and his priceless reaction to finding a stranger in his home. Brad Pitt, as the over-the-top gymnast, is the only one that sort of left me cold. Nearly anyone other than Brad Pitt could've played that character. A seasoned comedian, no doubt, would've knocked it out of the park. Is this a highlight of the Coens? Not exactly, but it's entertaining as hell.",8,3,4,8 September 2017
Baby Driver," You've Come a Long Way, Baby
","It's a bad summer for movies. But one film is about to rise from the ashes and show us all how it's done. Edgar Wright never disappoints, and he's done it again with Baby Driver. This is no clichéd action flick. What Wright does here is innovative and badass. It's set to a groovy soundtrack of vinyl crackling hits, mostly from the early sixties. The bullets fly and the cars skid in sync with the songs. The opening sequence of the film is nearly a masterpiece. Right from the first five minutes, you are in love with Baby.. yeah, that's his name. The silent hero who communicates through his first-gen iPod shuffle. There are scenes and characters who needed some more fleshing out, like Baby's love interest. But overall, we've found the diamond in the rough of 2017.",8,13,24,28 June 2017
The Revenant," Chilling
","For those of you looking for an action movie, move along. It's another artsy movie from Alejandro Gonzalez-Innaritu. For anyone wondering, it's not as good as Birdman, but I think that was going to be a given. What is quite surprising, and most incredible about this movie, is Leonardo DiCaprio. He's given one earth-shattering performance after another, and just when you think you've seen it all, he appears in this. He just tortures himself. Crawling in the snow with his bare fingers, chowing down on bloody deer meat, sleeping inside a warm horse like a Tauntaun. He's simply fantastic. If he doesn't win the Oscar this year, he'll never win one.The other standout is the cinematography. It's the best of it's kind I've seen since 'There Will Be Blood'. Every scene looked absolutely breathtaking. Without question, Chivo is the best cinematographer working in the business today. As long as he keeps shooting movies, everyone needs to step aside and let him show us all how it's done.Among all this praise, I don't think it's a perfect movie. It's biggest flaw is the casting of Tom Hardy. We've all been hearing praise for his performance, and at times, he does do a good job. But he sounds exactly the same as he did in Lawless. It's the same voice. It's probably the same voice for Bane too, but we won't be able to ever know for sure behind the mask. That garbled, bullfrog.. yeah, try something else next time, Tom. Also, I kind of would have liked the movie to do without the stereotypical Native American side characters. I was having 'Dances with Wolves' flashbacks. Plus, it didn't really advance the main story, other than the fact that those were people who the American's were fighting at that time. Then again, i've never read the actual story.. but even if I did, I think that Glass's journey was far more interesting cinematically.",8,1,4,7 January 2016
Split," Split Decisions
","M. Night Shyamalan walks a thin line between being clever, and overreaching in an attempt to be clever. When he succeeds, his films are astoundingly compelling and fascinating. When he fails, he makes films like 'The Happening' and 'Lady in the Water'. There is no middle ground for Shyamalan. So where does Split fall? Fortunately, Split is a successful Shyamalan movie. Arguably, since Unbreakable, it's his most captivating film. A film that explored mental illness and trauma through an interesting perspective. Strange, considering this film was advertised as a psychological thriller. Does that sound problematic? Bear with me.Kevin is our focus. He kidnaps three teenage girls and locks them in an undisclosed basement. To their horror, the three girls discover that Kevin isn't who he says he is. In fact, he's not one person, he's multiple. Men, women and children combined. What they don't know is that he is under the surveillance of a psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher, who tries to crack the code behind his extreme case of Dissociative Identity Disorder, and whether or not it has unleashed powers within him unknown to science. The only other person that may be on to him is Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), one of the three girls who herself understands what past trauma does to a fragile mind. She was molested as a young girl, whereas Kevin was verbally abused by his overbearing mother. Her goal is to escape the basement, while also trying to figure out how to tame the beast of Kevin's psyche. What she doesn't realize is that there happens to be a real beast lurking within Kevin. The 24th personality. A superhuman animal strong enough to bend steel and devour humans.Split's thesis is both disturbing and endearing, if that even makes a lick of sense. Shyamalan keeps going back to the theme of the 'broken' person. How trauma can at times harness untold, unknown abilities later on that can be used as protection mechanisms. Through the lens of a psychological horror thriller, Syamalan want's us to sympathize with Kevin and look into our own perceptions of what mental disorders really are so that we can challenge them. It all demands of a fantastic performance by James McEvoy, and he delivers full on. This is one of the unsung performances of 2017. He received no award show love. That's a crying shame.There's a lot to take in, but a lot to love about Split.",9,0,0,19 January 2019
Hugo," A Trip to the Moon
","As I watched Hugo, I was transported back to when I was a younger film student. In particular, the first time I saw George Melies's groundbreaking silent picture, 'A Trip to the Moon'. Every film student, one way or another, is exposed to Melies and consequently inspired by his works. Such is the case of the ultimate film scholar, Martin Scorsese. Though the tone of this film is a drastic departure from the dark, violent themes and characters of the Scorsese filmography, perhaps there was no better filmmaker to have made this film than him. A master filmmaker, with an encyclopedia's knowledge of film history is the only person suitable to make such a love letter to the humble beginnings of cinema.Hugo is a heartwarming picture. The cast is marvelous, and so is the production design. Not without it's flaws, in terms of run time, it could've been much tighter.",7,0,0,8 November 2017
BASEketball," Dude. Bro.
","BASEketball is one of the most bizarre films ever made. Obscure and forgotten, but I almost urge you to see it. It's so inconsequential, and counter-productive, and incredulous in it's existence. I can only make sense of it as the product of two theories that have been floating around my head as I watched it. Theory #1: (perhaps the most likely) David Zucker, having realized that Airplane-style parody movies were dead, attempted to make a late-90's, Adam Sandler-esque gross-out comedy and settled on the South Park duo when no other big name comic talents signed on to the project. Theory #2: Trey and Matt wrote a screenplay for one of their trademark surreal comedy ideas, realized they didn't have the financial means to create it themselves, and hired David Zucker to direct it for them. Whatever the reason may be, the Zuckers and South Park teamed up to make this, and their comedic sensibilities mix like oil and water. In one scene, it's just Trey and Matt goofing around with a camera rolling, in the next scene, it's a typical Zucker set-piece with sight gags cluttering the frame. It's an absolute mess. It's comedy gone awry... and yet, that gives it one hell of a charm. I laughed many times. More times than I had every right to. I love a good oddity. It sparks interesting conversation. It's just fun.",5,0,0,28 August 2019
We're the Millers," A Fun But Heavily Flawed Romp
","'We're the Millers' is a film aiming to be an unconventional and irreverent R-rated comedy and somehow missed its margin by a devastatingly huge amount. The events that happen in this picture should be grounds for genius comedic situations and fresh dialogue snapping one great line after another. Unfortunately, what we get is a lumbering comedy that relies too much on clichés, even despite the fact that the movie clearly wants to be different and edgy. A fake-out family road trip to smuggle a surplus of weed is essentially the plot of the film. I could think of a million funny family satire that could have spawned from that idea. But fortunately, this movie uses on some occasions, very clever moments of inspired comic genius. There aren't enough of them, but whenever a joke hits in this movie, it hits pretty hard. I enjoy a nice big laugh in a movie, even within a movie thats not all that great. I have to say, i loved the choice of casting. It really can't get much better than the people they chose to be the Millers. Jason Sudeikis plays his charming average joe character so playfully, you honestly can't help but fall in love with whatever he does. Jennifer Aniston is well.. the most perfect woman to ever grace the earth (one man's opinion obviously). Even Ed Helms gets in a couple of yuks! So it goes without saying, We're the Millers is not a bad movie. Its actually worth your while in watching.",7,1,1,22 December 2013
Jarhead," Lite Metal Jacket
","Jarhead is a war movie that's as much about war as Raging Bull was about boxing. That is, it's a film about isolation, boredom, and when you just boil it all down, sexual deprivation. Jarhead has a premise to be exceptionally good, and at times, it is. But it's storyline is messy. If Anthony Swofford was an unreliable narrator in the purest sense of the word, that would be okay. Throughout the film, we are given a glimpse into his fears of coming home to an unfaithful girlfriend, as his brothers in arms fantasize about sleeping with her. These scenes, in particular, really stuck with me. Already tormented with insecurity, it would have been really powerful had Jarhead focused in on Anthony's growing paranoia about his relationship. Mendes only makes this aspect one of the many symptoms of the isolation of war. To that effect, Jarhead on the whole feels like a spiritual reboot of Full Metal Jacket. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's not something we haven't seen before.",8,1,1,6 May 2020
The Machinist," Just When You Think You've Seen Everything.
","This thriller is absolutely gripping. It messes with your mind, in ways you couldn't predict. Just when you think you know what's going on, it pulls the rug from underneath you. It's seriously worth watching, besides the incredible performance by Christian Bale. I really think he's a modern-day Brando. He physically changes himself into every role he's in, but none more strikingly than this. Here, he is famously, unhealthily skinny. Really gives an interesting juxtaposition to the muscular Patrick Bateman and the grossly overweight Irving Rosenfeld. If all of those movies were in a trilogy, I'd call this American Insomniac.",8,0,0,7 February 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," A Tour-De-Force for McConaughey and Leto
","Make no mistake about it, this is NOT your typical AIDS movie. Those of you who are all caught up with that hype should just stop reading and go somewhere else. Dallas Buyers Club is a deeply upsetting but masterfully crafted piece of genius filmmaking. I have never felt so sorry for any movie character quite like Ron Woodroof. He's a flawed cowboy who's made a few too many mistakes that ends up putting his health in fatal jeopardy. The odds are not in his favor, but he has time to kill, and he makes up for it by selling an illegal drug that prolongs the lifespan of the average AIDS patient. Enter, the Dallas Buyers Club. His partner is crime is a transsexual named Rayon played by Jared Leto, who flirts his life away, but all in hopes of becoming a beautiful woman. The fact is, McConaughey and Leto give the performances of their lifetime. While I don't think this was the movie that deserved their Oscar, I can proudly say that it is the best performances they've done to date and that is deserving enough of the award. The story is also very engaging, fueled with Jean-Marc Valee's unprecedented direction. He's practically the next Darren Aronofsky. This is an urgent, meaningful movie and It deserves your time in watching it.",9,1,1,9 March 2014
The Exorcist," Compelling
","It's widely considered, the scariest movie ever made. It's not really up for debate either, much to my chagrin. I don't think it's as scary, as it is disturbing, and absolutely brilliant. By that, I mean, a film that puts the 'fear' of God back into the viewers. What other film could do that? The Exorcist is a triumph of special effects. The demon, Pazuzu, looks just as good in 1973 as it does now. It's a mystery why such brilliant practical effects were replaced with CGI. This film also takes you on a psychological ordeal. The line is blurred between reality and fiction, between faith and science, between lies and truths. You'll keep wondering if it's all just some kind of disease Regan has.. well, until the exorcism begins.. then it's pretty obvious. I loved this movie. It's a testament to the power of the cinema, and what it can do for people, for better or worse. People ran out of the movie theaters when the film was released, possibly traumatized. For the era of Vietnam, that is really something.",10,3,6,12 June 2015
Jackie," Camelot
","Even at this incredible, ever-changing, unprecedented moment in our country's history, we are still living in the aftermath of the assassination of the beloved 35th president, John F. Kennedy. What we lost in him was a beautiful, prosperous America that would've sent us all into a golden age. His death sent us spiraling into an age of cynicism and rage. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of Newark, NJ. Our country hasn't missed an opportunity to honor him, especially through film. But what about his beloved, Jackie O? What is her side of this tragic story?Pablo Larrain directs a visually striking, and beautifully acted portrait of our most treasured of FLOTUS's, complete with another career defining performance from Natalie Portman. She blows the doors off the hinges as Jackie. What a stunning, breathtaking portrayal. I kept forgetting that she was only in a movie. I wasn't watching archival footage. But that's the real strength of the film. It's made to look and feel like a fluid piece of American history, complete with cinematography that looks like it was shot on Super 16mm film. Many moments of the film caught my eye and many others broke my heart. I will always remember the long shot of Jackie, in Air Force One shortly after the assassination, cleaning the blood of her husband off of her face, weeping. Or perhaps what the song 'Camelot' meant to her husband, as they danced to it in the very last scene of the film. You feel her agony, and her loss.But despite all of this well deserved praise, Jackie isn't a film I'd watch ever again. It's extremely slow paced for it's 99 minutes, and that perhaps is deliberate. But it makes for a sleepy time at the movies. Also, Peter Sarsgaard was not convincing as RFK, and neither was John Carroll Lynch as LBJ. Portman's performance as Jackie is so monumental, that the other lackluster performances do not contribute much at all by comparison.",5,2,5,19 December 2016
Inside Out," Sweet Emotion
","It's time to get emotional. Believe the hype, folks, that this is the best film Pixar has done since 'Toy Story 3'. Take note, other animated movies that pale in comparison, and maybe learn something or two from the master, Pete Doctor. Everything is pitch-perfect here. The four main emotions are so lovable, hilarious and cuddly in their own special ways. Prepare to see these little guys all over the place. What's even more memorable about this picture, is that it's story is so mature, even for a Pixar movie. Adults are going to love this film a lot more than kids. I was howling at some of the jokes, many of which will go WAY over little kid's heads. Inside Out also provides the best casting out of any other film this year. Amy Poehler really blew me away here as a dramatic actress.. seriously. There is so much going for this movie, and you really owe yourselves to see it. Above all, it tells a truly, well-done heartwarming story that makes you appreciate family and the happiest memories of childhood.",9,5,27,20 June 2015
No Country for Old Men," Southern Fried Murder
","The Coen Bros. have had their heyday long before the release of No Country for Old Men. Had they left the 90's burnt out, it would've been completely understandable. But 10 years ago, they crafted an ingenious comeback by making perhaps the most convincing, powerful film about pure evil in history. No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest films ever made.. but you already knew that. I'm sort of late to catching up to this one and I regret it entirely. Visually speaking, it captures the darkness of our world in ways no film has ever been capable of. In terms of acting, it absolutely soars. Broiln and Jones are incredible. Javier Bardem is terrifying as Anton. He eats at your soul. As far as films that depict serial killers, this is as real as it gets. Right down to his weapon of choice, an air-powered captive bolt gun. The savagery is what gets me the most.No Country for Old Men explains to us in no uncertain terms how malicious and conniving humanity can be. What's even better is the fact that movies like these aren't rare to come by. They've been made time and again. The Coens just decided to make one more. Bless them for it.",10,3,4,18 October 2017
District 9," 9 stars.
","If the aliens were to land, would they be hyper intelligent beings that know things about our galaxy far beyond what we could ever comprehend? District 9 envisions them in a whole different way. Truthfully, it's exactly how it would be in our reality. The aliens here are prawn creatures, suffering from intergalactic income inequality and starvation. Upon crash landing to earth, they are subjected to Jim Crowe-like laws that separate them from humans and are eventually placed into internment camps. The irony: this all takes place in South Africa.District 9 is half mocumentery and half bodily horror movie. It is equal parts brilliant. It's one of the most innovative and original alien films out there. It approaches this subject matter so soberly, it feels real. It's science fiction, that cleverly treads softly on fantasy. The prawn creatures are fascinating to look at. Even more fascinating is the smarmy journalist and his transformation into a prawn creature after being exposed with top secret alien tech. For what this film was trying to be, it succeeds in being.",9,0,0,23 May 2020
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Outlaw to the Outlaw
","Wasn't 2007 a great year for movies? Zodiac, There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, how about this lesser celebrated classic?A long, brooding western. Yet it is a treasure chest of acting. Casey Affleck gives his best performance as Robert Ford. Ruthlessly envious, and yes, a coward. Brad Pitt is equally amazing as Jesse James. Deakins is one of the very best cinematographers out there, and this is some of his best work. Even when he's not with the Coen bros. he's killing it elsewhere. Storytelling style was very well done, which included a great narration that reminded me of Ricky Jay's from Magnolia. What is even more interesting than the story leading up to the assassination. is what happens after, and the guilt, or lack thereof, from Rob Ford. He wanted to become a hero, and instead, became a loser, for all the people he thought hated Jesse James, had idolized him. Tragic irony, and karma is the main theme of this film, much like Amadeus. This was a great watch.",8,0,0,29 February 2016
Toy Story 4," To Infinity and Beyond.
","Toy Story. The animated franchise that has defined me as a filmgoer, filmmaker and writer. I'm turning 24 next month, and Toy Story has damn-near been in my life for all of those years.The first film was released on Thanksgiving of 1995. I was 4 months old, sleeping in cribs, without any indication of what movies where, or for that matter, any kind of entertainment. But little did I know it would be the first film I would ever watch. The VHS was released the year after, and as I was learning to walk, talk and play, Toy Story played in the background. Something inside me clicked while I watched it. I was enchanted by it's world of make-believe. A world of talking toys. What more could a little kid want? My mother swears that I knew every line of dialogue from the film by the time I was 2 years old. Woody and Buzz where my bread and butter. I had both of them as toys of my own. To me, I was no different than Andy, because Andy was every kid in the world. What Toy Story so astoundingly captured was the bond between a child and his toy. It's unmistakeable and iconic. Needless to say, Toy Story was the family film we never knew we needed, as as a feat of technological genius, one of the finest films ever made.Toy Story 2 was released 4 years later. By that time, I was old enough to see it in a theater. I'm happy to tell you that I still haven't forgotten the memory of seeing it nearly 20 years ago. My parents took me, and I took my Woody doll with me. We went on a cold and snowy November afternoon. I placed Woody next to me in my seat as the theater lights dimmed to darkness. We loved it. Not to mention, not a single dry eye in that audience during Jessie's ballad, 'When She Loved Me'. But from that experience, I vividly remember leaving Woody behind in the theater, and we had to drive all the way back to retrieve it. Life imitates art.The gap between Toy Story 2 and 3 was 11 years. That's an eternity to a child. That's your entire elementary and middle school years in the books. I had enough Pixar movies in between to hold me over. By the time Toy Story 3 was released in the summer of 2010, I was already finished with my freshman year of high school. This time, I didn't see it in theaters, and I still don't know the reason. Was I going through a phase? Was I becoming cynical? Did i think I outgrew the material? Lord knows. I watched it when it premiered on cable later that year. That same spirit still stuck with me. The trilogy was complete, the toys left Andy and there was nothing else left to say.. or so we thought.Toy Story 4 is here. I wouldn't blame you if you feel weary about that. If ever there was a film franchise that shouldn't be milked to death and exploited until every last capital of it has been exhausted, you are looking at it. To even justify a fourth installment, they needed to work hard and get it right. The weekend isn't over and the jury is still out, but i have my verdict. Toy Story 4 is necessary and beautiful. To all fans of the series and any fan of animation, drop what you are doing and see this now. This is worth an hour and change of watching non-streamable content. This is how cinema lives on in the year 2019. For me, as a grown man, this brings it all full circle.We pick up right where we left off, with the toys belonging to little Bonnie. Still going on grand adventures in the bedroom. It's the first day of kindergarten for Bonnie, and she's too shy and scared to make any friends. Lucky for her, Woody comes to rescue and provides her with supplies to make her own friend. From there, we meet Forky. The product of what happens when toys play God. He's a stick figure made out of a spork, with a serious existential crisis. He keeps throwing himself in the trash. That's right, Forky is suicidal. You couldn't have a Pixar movie without throwing in a little dark social commentary. Bonnie and her parents take a road trip to an amusement park and the toys come with. But Woody gets carried away while guarding the troubled Forky. Woody and Forky get left behind after another episode, and vow to catch up to the park in the morning. As they walk into town, a vintage antique store catches Wood's eye with memorabilia attributed to Bo Peep, the toy that got away long, long ago. The antique store is filled with lost, abandoned toys, including a lonely girl doll named Gabby Gabby who's only friends are creepy ventriloquist dummies who stand upright on their own.. yeah, they are just as creepy as they sound. Forty is captured and Woody escapes the store. He lands in a nearby playground filled with even more abandoned toys, where he is reunited with none other than Bo Peep. It's been a long time since Woody has seen her and she's gotten a 2019 upgrade since. She's a swashbuckling badass now, accompanied with her tiny adorable sidekick, Officer Giggle McDimples. Woody and Bo join forces with Buzz , two smart-ass plush toys (voiced by Key and Peele) and a Canadian daredevil biker (voiced by Keanu Reeves) to save Forky and return him in one piece to Bonnie.I could gush about this film for hours. First, on a technical level, Toy Story 4 is the most gorgeous looking film of the series. You can see every scratch, blemish and texture on every toy. Gone are the awkward polygons and fuzzy graphics of the Windows 95' generation. I was captivated by everything, from the photo realistic backgrounds to the shining reflective porcelain that gleams off of Bo Peep. It's as sharply funny as any of the Toy Story films, with enough adult asides to keep anyone in the audience from being alienated. It brings the series to an appropriate end that, while wasn't entirely necessary after the third film, concludes the journey of Woody and friends in a totally satisfying way.Do I envision watching Toy Story 5 at 40 years old? Or 6 at 60? I don't know, but if indeed they are in the works, and if they are as lovely as all 4 previous films have been, I'll warmly invite the opportunities to see more. These movies awesome. To infinity and beyond.",10,135,244,23 June 2019
To Rome With Love," Arrivederci
","At it's best moments, To Rome with Love is a love letter to one of the most treasured cities on the planet. At it's worst, it's another vapid, misogynistic Woody Allen movie. The problematic director has made unbelievably good films, there's no question. But when he falls, its embarrassing, and creepy. The women in this movie have no dimension or depth. All are objects for men to deal with. Rome is a city of love, but watching this movie, it seems like a brothel. Only two of the four stories leave a gratifying impact. Roberto Benigni as the tortured celebrity is a really funny, exaggerated look at paparazzi culture. The shower taking Opera singer is a hilarious side story as well. Everything else falls apart like a stale slice of tiramisu. Italia, you deserve better.",4,0,2,5 July 2019
The Pianist," A Symphony.
","A harrowing, devastating story of the miraculous survival of a Jewish pianist during the holocaust. Like Schindler's List, The Pianist accurately documents the horrors of the holocaust to such an extent that it exists less like a work of art, and more like a public service. Films like this help us never to forget and never to repeat this awful moment in human history. Classroom viewings are mandatory. Not to mention, a world class performance by Adrian Brody. He is immersed in this role. To see him wandering through the rubble of Warsaw, looking for any last morsel of food to eat is a stroke of acting and cinema genius that you won't believe even when you see it. This is what dedication to storytelling is all about.",10,3,4,31 March 2019
The Favourite," Play the Favourite
","Yorgos Lathinmos might have just made his masterpiece, or so it seems, because The Favourite is as uniquely a product of his twisted world as it is a marketable indie Hollywood film that nobody would expect from him. He's come a long, far way from his Dogtooth days. Yet, that spirit still lives on. Films that make you cringe and gasp at the sublimely grim existences he allows to to explore. The Favorite is deeply unsettling. But at the same time, whimsical, vulgar and hilarious. I'd say watching The Favourite after watching Dogtooth similar to drinking bourbon after swigging gasoline. One burns just a little bit less, but it still burns.The victorian era of Great Britain has never been more salacious. It's the story of two women, Sarah Churchill and her cousin Abigail Hill, vying for the affection and favor of Queen Anne. As the bloody politics of Europe swirls around the men in parliament, the women of the kingdom settle a battle just as bloody and perhaps even more vicious. Fame, glory, and yes, even sex. Advising the Queen is a royal honor worth having, and Abigail wants in on it. But she needs to shiv Churchill and throw her out with the royal garbage. This becomes a devious, fascinating spectacle. On top of this, Lathinmos comes at the era itself with nothing but good humor. Picture Milos Forman's Amadeus colliding with Monty Python, and you get the absurdity of The Favourite. Don't make the mistake of taking the subject matter too seriously, because even the characters don't. Between debating politics, the kingdom partakes in such sophisticated pastimes as duck racing, fire eating, throwing fruit at portly naked men and dance competitions that look more in line with the 21st century than the 18th.This movie is begging for me to love it, and in many ways, I do. The originality is off the charts. You won't see any movie this season as wild as The Favourite, and for a stuffy-looking period piece, thank God for that.",8,2,5,9 December 2018
It Follows," Video Nasty
","An STD, in which it's side-effects include visions of zombified loved-ones trying to kill/sleep with you. Is this a horror movie or a 90-minute PSA for abstinence? However you interpret it, it's a brilliantly filmed and edited throwback to the early 80's, VCR horror genre. It Follows deserves a spot in the naughty isle of the Blockbuster in your mind. It captures that same unintentionally funny aspects of 80's slasher flicks. The soundtrack is quite reminiscent of Goblin. Also, for a film of such very little budget, the cinematography is world's ahead of any recent horror film of the mainstream.",8,0,0,10 July 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," California Dreaming.
","There may never be another filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. If there is, we surely are in luck. But in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank God for that fact alone. He's a filmmaker's filmmaker. His love of cinema verges on fetishism. His mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the American psyche in a time long past it's expiration date. So long as there's a reel and a way, Tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his 9th feature film. It's been announced as his second to last film. Rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. I pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if Quentin is seriously considering it, I'll warmly and happily accept that. The truth is, it's all been leading up to this moment. Quentin's personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in Hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. He went for it, and he did it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since Pulp Fiction. For me, nothing short of perfect. Everything I wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. I'm convinced that after the second and even third viewings, i'll still find new things to love about it. For nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go.Here's the story. The year is 1969. We meet the dashing Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his frisky stuntman sidekick, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. They were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. They were the best actors in Hollywood.. until now. After an unkindly meeting with his agent, Marvin Schwartz (played in outrageous fashion by the great Al Pacino), Rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. In other words, he's lost everything. Reduced to playing walk-on roles in late-60's TV shows, and B-grade Italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. Devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the Hollywood hills, while Cliff goes home to a dingy trailer next-door to a drive-in movie theater, to feed his loyal pit-bull Brandy. California Dreaming is not all that it seems. But wouldn't you know it, Rick Dalton has a new neighbor. One Roman Polanksi and his wife, superstar Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). The contrast doesn't get much starker. As Rick Dalton disappears into the hazy California sunset, Tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. We begin to alternate between these two stories. Rick Dalton's personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and Sharon Tate humbly enjoying her career at it's peak. She's so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. But in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. That evil being the Manson family. Cliff, Rick and Sharon all have individual run-ins with Charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a head-on collision with Helter Skelter.From it's very beginning, Tarantino doesn't just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. I was there with all of them. Many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting (not unlike K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's) the soundtrack of our film. Killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any Tarantino film, is brief. The first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. But that's the point. Tarantino places the audience through multiple POVs in order to illustrate this time in Hollywood. It was a technique I didn't expect, but I adored it all the same, and if anything, I'll always remember these sequences first when I think of the film. DiCaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed Rick Dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if he's still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. Brad Pitt is effortlessly cool as Cliff Booth. Dude is the suavest partner-in-crime since Paul Newman. Robbie plays Tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in American history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. Not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. If she had a a song, it would probably be 'Good Morning, Starshine', though we all know she was a Paul Revere and the Raiders fan. Tate represents here all that was good of the late 60's. That far-out, free-spirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most Californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didn't take it to the extreme. If you did, you'd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies.That's the other thing that Tarantino explores in 1969. If you were worried about a film about the Manson family that glorifies them as super cool anti-heroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. Because Tarantino clearly doesn't just hate Charles Manson, he loathes him. The man who, in his mind, killed the 1960's and the Hollywood he loved. On that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesn't really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? Well, I promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of August 8th 1969 don't play out here as they did in history. What results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the Manson Family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop.I left the theater having felt like I drank a strong cocktail of Boogie Nights and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. This is a movie, and a trip and an experience you won't soon forget. See this thing, right now. See it twice. See it three times. Invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. Explore this tapestry of Americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock' n' roll and movies. You'll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied.",10,66,108,28 July 2019
Gone Girl," Heart-Stopping, Spine-Tingling, Edge-Of-Your-Seat, Movie Madness
","David Fincher's resume shows that he is one of the finest directors in the business today. From Fight Club to The Social Network, you can't possibly go wrong. Well, believe me when I tell you that Gone Girl stands in the ranks of his best work. This is a hell of a movie. Or, if you will, a hell of a book, turned into a hell of a movie. But the 'what came first?' argument is invalid here, when Fincher successfully replicates Gillian Flynn's brilliant thriller novel on screen, as he does here. The words fly off the page so seamlessly. It's almost seductive. The performances are grade A, coming from Ben Affleck but ESPECIALLY coming from Rosamund Pike. Pike steals the show as Amy Dunne, making her the most sinister on-screen anti-hero since Keyser Soze. Even performances from the likes of Neil Patrick Harris and .. I can't believe I'm saying this. Tyler Perry are at the top of their game. It's the most jaw dropping film of the year, and as a film-goer, you will be left satisfied. Gone Girl is the run-away hit of the Fall and the beginning of what is sure to be a great Oscar season.",9,2,11,25 October 2014
Drive," Stop and Go.
","Drive's best moments are in the silence of its main character and the internal decisions he makes that are illustrated through the brilliant direction of Nicholas Winding Refyn. Less is more in film, and Refyn is a master of visual storytelling. It's plot isn't a groundbreaking one. A heist gone wrong. A gangster movie of the most typical kind. So when the characters get a chance to speak, the dialogue itself doesn't pack the same punch. The rest is thrilling and nerve wracking, and fabulously executed by NWR. Placing him on the map as a seriously good film director. The cast is also, in hindsight, amusing to see. The debuts of giants like Oscar Isaac and Christina Hendricks are fascinating. So are Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks as a ruthless gangster. Imagine that.",8,1,2,14 December 2019
Room," Does Room Come Together?
","Room is half an extraordinary film and half a decent one. Both halves, in my opinion, don't properly come together to create one incredible product. The tonal and narrative shift that this film takes is jarring. Perhaps that was the intent.We begin within the confines of a makeshift room inside of a shed. Ma and Jack are the captives of a disgusting cretin named 'Old Nick'. He kidnapped Ma years ago, and he subjects her to sexual slavery. I might note that the film shows us what 'Old Nick' looks like, and I think that was a mistake. Why you might ask? It's because of the powerful dynamic that director Lenny Abrahamson establishes right from the very first moment we meet Ma and Jack. We see the special place they've created for themselves in spite of their circumstance. Everything about it seems ordinary, and that's because Ma makes sure that it seems that way to Jack. Jack only knows Room. It's his only base of reality. Abrahamson purposely centers the film through both points of view. In this sense, this first half of the film is extraordinary So why did we need to humanize their captor? Only a sub-human creature would do this to two innocent people. We know these people exist in real life. We choose not to recognize them in news reporting, for the mere risk of legitimizing who they are and the crimes they committed. Cinematically speaking, it would have been more powerful to have made 'Old Nick' an off-screen character. It would have been more real, and more chilling.Ma and Jake ultimately escape captivity through a crafty ruse of an emergency that includes hot water and a rug. We enter the next half of the film. Life outside of Room. Ma and Jack readjusting to the real world, and Jack's inability to cope with what the real world is. All he knows and loves is Room, and it leaves him completely detached to what is normal. Jacob Tremblay gives an incredible performance. However, the new characters that we meet in this half do not add anything new or substantial to this story. Or at least that is what it seems like, because of the drastic tonal shift this film takes. Needless to say, I wasn't as hooked into this world as I was inside of Room. I wish I was.But warts and all, this is a well made, and extremely well acted film. Brie Larson's role of her lifetime was this one. To realize she's accomplished this and Captain Marvel before turning 30 is mind-blowing. She has not years, but decades of greatness ahead of her. The same can be said for young Jacob Tremblay. Room is, if nothing else, an effective emotional ride, which was all it ever needed to be.",7,0,1,27 April 2019
A Quiet Place," Silence is golden.
","Hush, hush, my darling.. or the spider/Cloverfield monster hybrid will eat you. A Quiet Place is in line with Hollywood's sick new throwback to 1980's horror flicks. A time when gore wasn't the weapon of choice of freaking you out. A film, quite literally, full of jump scares. But only the good kind. You see, the characters of the film cannot talk. This young family needs to hide out in the woods and not make a single sound, lest they get eaten by the monster lurking in the shadows. This monster hates sounds. That is because every sound it hears, down to the last tick of a clock pierces through his hearing lobe at maximum volume. What an awful way to live. It's a chilling, nerve-wracking journey to stay alive and Krasinski has made the minimalist sci-fi horror flick of the year. Not to mention is Emily Blunt's silent performance that should hear the calls of golden statuettes later this year. It's a squirming good time. I made sure to finish my snack before the opening credits of the film, just to make sure I wasn't making any sounds myself.",7,0,1,10 April 2018
Amadeus," Mediocrities, I Absolve You!
","The great epic biopic, about the great epic artist himself. What's so fascinating about it, is it's style. It's refusal to be pretentious. If that's not enough, it mocks pretension by using Antonio Salieri. He's just so insufferably envious of Mozart, that he inadvertently kills him. Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself. Without prior knowledge, you'd leave the film thinking that this whole time, he was an idiot savant. But perhaps, Mozart is just as colorful as his punk rock wigs... at least that would be what we all would hope for. While I don't think it's Milos Forman's best film, it's a magnificent achievement, and for the grand majority of it's 3 hours, it's engrossing.",8,0,1,25 June 2015
The Hurt Locker," Explosive.
","The Hurt Locker is a war picture with a killer adrenaline rush. These aren't ordinary soldiers. These men work with bombs. It's a race against the clock as Sgt. William James tries to find and disarm IED's in war torn Baghdad. Kathryn Bigelow was born to direct scenes like this. It's excruciating to watch, but you can't have it any other way. I want a war movie to rattle me. The Hurt Locker did just that.Need I also forget to mention that the film stars Hawkeye and Falcon? Saving the day for the first time. MCU fans will not be disappointed.",7,0,0,22 April 2019
1917," Band of Brothers
","This is a good war movie. An old classic with a 21st century pastiche. The uninterrupted camera shot is meant to be noticeably cool, and yet, I really didn't notice it. Maybe that was the intention. It's easy to get used to. Or it could be a testament to how far we've come technologically. Either way, this is a gorgeous film. It's story is very touching as well. Unsung praise also goes to the acting here. The question is, did it warrant its Golden Globe win over The Irishman? Listen, this was good, but wtf Hollywood Foreign Press? No, not by any stretch of the imagination.",7,0,1,15 January 2020
Children of Men," Devastating in Every Way
","In it's first hour, Children of Men comes across as a formulaic post-apocalyptic drama. A lot of it's early strength comes from the central cast including a stand-out performance by the great Michael Caine and Julianne Moore. Sequences of the film, including the famous drive-by death scene, horrify and amaze us.. and unfortunately dwindle off back into the forgettable plot. Then, something amazing happens. The final 30 minutes of this film is a cinematic explosion. It's some of the best filmmaking of the past 20 years. Emmanuel Lubezki, quite arguably the finest living cinematographer today, provides a visual experience that conveys a certain kind horror and hopelessness that many films have never achieved. Children of Men is a stunning feat.",8,1,1,9 April 2017
The Evil Dead," Groovy.
","Looking back, this was the humble beginnings of a horror icon and a beloved franchise. But back in the early 80's, this thing was pretty outrageous. I would have paid money to see people's initial reaction during the first run of The Evil Dead. The story, by itself, is your typical cabin-in-the-woods creeper with a supernatural twist. The curse of the necronomicon. Old H.P. Lovecraft never saw it coming. From there, the film turns into a cross between The Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead, with the gore cranked all the way off the dial. It's gross, man. But it's all done practically. Scratch that.. it's all done way on the cheap. That's what gives this it's charm. It's so bad it's good. Minus the tree scene, which is just not good at all, but we won't get into that. Shout out to the cinematographer (Tim Philo) for using extreme, fast dolly shots when they were virtually unheard of.",7,0,0,17 January 2020
From Dusk Till Dawn," Soul-Suckingly Good
","From Dusk Till Dawn is a bad-ass horror comedy. A blood drenched good time, with an amazing script written by, who else but Tarantino? It felt like two separate films, which is the coolest and strangest thing about it. It's a violent crime drama for the first hour, and then a wild horror comedy for the last half hour. Some call it indecisive, but when you tell Tarantino to make a horror film, this is the exact thing he'd come up with. The only thing is, if it were directed by him, it would've been such a masterpiece. Without him in control of every aspect of production, it just seems like something is missing. Robert Rodriguez isn't exactly a great director, and sometimes, you can see that here. Bad CGI anyone? Ah, who cares? I enjoyed the hell out to this thing.",9,1,3,14 June 2015
Jerry Maguire," Right on the Money
","Show me the money. You complete me. You had me at hello. Jerry Maguire is Cameron Crowe's bread and butter. Without it, there would be no 'Almost Famous'. It's one of the most quoted movies of an entire generation. Perhaps that's what lessens the experience in retrospect. Oh yes, I liked this movie. I liked it a whole lot in a few sections. The beginning monologue and montage is absolutely golden. An exuberant, excellent hook that highlights the best of Crowe's ability, and why I admire him so much as a director. On that alone, the movie rockets itself into watchability, and seizes our attention for the 2 hours and 10 minutes it lasts. Rene Zellweger is really good here, as well as the ever adorable, Jonathan Lipnicki. Can we get a child star Oscar going? As if it wasn't enough, is 'Boyhood' a better incentive to start? Cuba Gooding Jr., who won the Oscar for his performance, nails it. He's the smartest and funniest person in the entire film. He had Jerry in the palm of his hand the whole time, and he picked his brain like no other. SHOW ME THE MONEY, JERRY! The performances rule. What's the biggest flaw? Well, the screenplay. I know, 20 years down the line, any movie is going to become cliché, but for some reason, this movie has spectacularly clichéd moments. The closing speech that Jerry gives is one that really highlights it. So, freaking, corny. Cameron Crowe is a great writer (a genius actually), and this movie has many memorable scenes of dialog, but he's always had trouble with writing touching speeches.. something he's been struggling with pretty severely as of late... (cough) 'Aloha' (cough). This is a fine piece of work, and worth seeing, but bring a toothbrush.. that's all I have to say.",6,1,1,12 June 2015
Quiz Show," Is that your final answer?
","The fix is in and television are the fixers.Quiz Show is a thoroughly fascinating picture. Based on the true story of the rigging of the American hit game show 'Twenty-One', and when America was captivated by the sharp and handsome intellectual faker Charles Van Doren over the schlubby savant Herb Stempel. Robert Redford meticulously brings back to life the art of the 1950's television game show. The glitz, the glamour, the product placements. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography takes your breath away, especially in the scene in which Stempel is forced to take the fall for Van Doren. Quite simply, one of the great scenes I've ever seen in film. Not to mention, John Turturro gives a performance for the ages.When the studio cameras are off and the congressional investigation begins, sadly, the film loses it's energy and edge and becomes a standard courtroom drama. But it must be stated, when this film gets you, you won't look away.",8,2,2,24 December 2017
Frank," AHead of the Game
","Michael Fassbender in a giant head might be the funniest thing I've seen in nearly a year. The novelty of his character, you would think, would be too quirky to give a chance, but Frank unexpectedly takes us on such a unique, fun journey. It's a film that mocks the pretentiousness of alternative rock bands, while giving pause to the men and women behind their identities. You'll be amazed at the significance, and the poignancy of the character of Frank.. all the while giving into a nice hearty laugh about it. This is one of the past year's great indie films. It's absolutely worth a watch.",8,0,1,15 March 2015
La La Land," Coming out Swinging
","'They don't make em like this anymore' is the thing most people will say when they leave the theater as the credits roll on La La Land, and they're right. La La Land is a 1950's movie musical, made in 2016. It's an absolutely romantic experience in every sense of the word. Romantic in it's visual scope, blazing off of the silver screen in Technicolor. Romantic in it's gushing, devastating appreciation for the art of Jazz. Romantic in the on-screen chemistry between Gosling and Stone, who make a sizzling hot couple for our times. I got a Seldon/Lockwood vibe, for sure. We've all heard the hype this film has been getting, and it's for a pretty good reason... 'They don't make em like this anymore'. Damn right, they don't. La La Land resurrects an era of filmmaking that many have thought to be long dead. It's reinvigorated a filmgoing spirit that once dominated the entire industry, and by any luck, might just dominate it once again. You can thank Damien Chazelle, who in one decade, cemented his name into film legend, and may almost certainly walk home with a shining Oscar this year.So with all of this in perspective, did the film blow me away? Sadly, I have to report, that it just didn't give me that perfect experience that I wanted. It's a great film, without question, but the problem is.. I've seen this musical. Singing in the Rain is my favorite musical of all-time. I've had that lighter than air, skip in my step, heart singing feeling before, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. Many people, especially millennials will be feeling this for the first time with La La Land, and that is something that I deeply respect. It's remarkable that films can still do this to people, in our jaded, desensitized, and often cruel world. Perhaps this is what people needed after enduring the unusually dark and divisive year that was 2016. A film like this needed to come along and lift our spirits up, and that's precisely what La La Land does.It's a feel-good romp, and we get this right as the film opens, with an absolutely swinging musical number on top of a disgustingly busy LA highway. I loved, loved, loved the music. It's absolutely the film's strength above all else. I'd give it two years time before La La Land ends up becoming a hit Broadway musical that gives Hamilton a run for it's money. Oh yes, it's that good.",9,2,6,28 December 2016
Groundhog Day," Fall-Down Funny and Touching
","Of all of the films that span the career of Bill Murray, I may have found my all-time favorite. Groundhog Day is a heartwarming film. A true one, not some clichéd schmaltz you normally associate romantic comedies with. This, to me, is in the same league as Capra. The best film made by the late, great, Harold Ramis. It starts out as the sarcastic comedy that Murray and Ramis are known for (in the vein of Ghostbusters). Then it turns into a psychological dark comedy, of which we follow Phil's decent into madness in cheery Punxsutawney. Then, a romantic comedy, that pays tribute to that age old premise of going back in time, to get the girl. C'mon, you've all had that desire. Then, something really special happens. We see Phil, not only mastering his sensitivity with women, but with humanity, period. Suddenly, Murray transforms into the world's greatest good samaritan, after spending so much time taking advantage of everyone. This is what you call, ingenious story and character development. It's wholesome, but not saccharine. It's incredibly funny and really, unexpectedly touching.",9,1,2,12 June 2015
Reservoir Dogs," Defines Tarantino as a Filmmaker
","Reservoir Dogs was Quentin Tarantino's first motion picture. But even as early as his first try, you can see every element that defines Tarantino as the unmatched filmmaking legend that he is revered as. It just might be the greatest indie film of all time. No budget, no SFX, no big sets and no wide distribution. But the amount of emotion, humor, sadism and reality that this film conveys is more extraordinary than any big name blockbuster. The plot of the film is brief, but it works. It's about a well organized heist that goes terribly wrong. Truth is, there is a rat in the whole operation, but who? With that in place, Tarantino takes us beyond what is said on paper and retraces the steps it took these men to get to the predicament they are in now. We see the back stories of Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, all without ever meaning to place them in the middle of the conflict. Its a movie that only the viewer can interpret, and the important facts are placed at the forefront to help come to a conclusion. This information works in favor of the main narrative. Some have complained about not hearing the origins of Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. I agree. Perhaps more clarification of their purposes might have enhanced the narrative. Perhaps it would have answered the obvious question, What was the point of this whole operation? I'm sure Quentin would have made the film twice as long and incorporated all of their stories had he made the film today. Needless to say, It does not take away from the experience. In fact, the mysteriousness makes it even more entertaining. Also, Reservoir Dogs will always fall under the controversy of being too violent for mainstream audiences, as well as being highly unnecessary. Well, I disagree. Violence is the name of the game in the life of being a Dog. If that means chopping off an ear while dancing to K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies, then why not? Reservoir Dogs doesn't exist to share a moral. Rather, it shows to us just how something so right can go so wrong. Even if the right was wrong in the first place. Reservoir Dogs is the precursor to the rest of Tarantino's career, and to get started watching the long journey of his success, make sure you pop in this amazing flick first.",10,1,1,21 February 2013
Love & Mercy," Heroes & Villains
","One of the top films of 2015. Love & Mercy is a tour-de-force of acting and visual craft. As erratic, unexpected and joyous as the noisy mind of Brian Wilson. Rarely, has a biopic been made that accurately depicts the wresting demons of an artist quite like this one. Many try, and fail. This one has a bevy of material to work with, and doesn't waste a drop. Paul Dano, once again, gives a performance that will leave you speechless. It astounds me how vastly overlooked he is an an actor. His work in Little Miss Sunshine and There Will Be Blood should've garnered him two Oscar nominations by now. John Cusack gives another Oscar worthy performance as the older Brian Wilson. This is essential two stories in one. The rocky rise of Brian Wilson, and the love story of his later years. Each connect due to the two people in his life that keep him from living; his abusive father and his abusive, leaching, Hollywood psychotherapist, played incredibly by Paul Giamatti. Elizabeth Banks also gives a pretty impressive turn as Melinda. After leaving the theater, I've fallen in love with The Beach Boys all over again. This is the movie fans have been waiting for. You don't want to miss this one, folks.",10,7,14,14 June 2015
The Red Violin," Stung together.
","Hidden in depths of independent film and 90's cinema, The Red Violin is an absolutely lovely film. A mosaic of fascinating international short stories, spanning the entire 300 year history of this particular violin. It's seen a lot of lives, and a lot of tragedy. It's the art that binds humanity together. It's a thematic balancing act that director Francois Girard does beautifully here. If all of that isn't good enough for you, Sam Jackson is in here too.",8,0,0,16 December 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," Fidelio
","It was Stanley Kubrick's final film.. and what a film it was. The Kubrick filmography after 2001: A Space Odyssey was big budgeted, highly conceived and highly anticipated event pictures. Eyes Wide Shut was given none of the pomp and circumstance in it's marketing campaign and neither was there any in the production phase. If anything, Eyes Wide Shut is a bookend to Kubrick's beautiful cinematic journey. It's a throwback, in many aspects, to the Film Noir wave of the 1950's, of which Kubrick made his name being apart of. In the genres of romance, mystery and suspense, Eyes Wide Shut remains to be one of the greatest films of it's kind ever made.But why? Simply, it's about the minimalism. It's actors are tabloid hollywood caliber, it's sets and locations are based in the everyday and yet Eyes Wide Shut is hauntingly extraordinary. In short, it's dreamlike. The way Kubrick tackles sexual paranoia cuts to core of what every man and woman fears when they are in a monogamous relationship. Kubrick illustrates these fears through the metaphor of the sex cult that Tom Cruise's character visits. Of course, that scene has become famous in it's grandiose imagination and unforgettable mis-en-scene. But the sex cult was never intended to be taken at face value. In fact, many viewers mistakenly assumed that that was what the entire film was centered on. In reality, the cult was just one of the many sexual tests that Cruise is forced to take.Cruise, over the course of the picture is put though a gauntlet of sexual temptation. For instance, visiting the house of the NYC prostitute, or the scene of the emotionally wrought, sexually starving widow of a dead patient. One of the most striking tests for me was the scene in which Cruise buys the costume from Rainbow Fashions, only to discover that the owner has a nymphomaniac of a daughter who he catches with a duo of Asian businessmen. She looks on at Cruise, with a flirtatious grin, telling him without saying a word, that he can have her anytime he wants. Kubrick explores sexual temptations from the covert to the overt and psychotically, the audience is challenged as well. How much would you get away with without your wife or husband knowing? On top of that, Kubrick asks an even scarier question. Are monogamous relationships a sham? Are we all just sexual creatures waiting for the next person to mate with? Nicole Kidman's monologue on her desire to cheat on her own husband is forever chilling. Kubrick, by no uncertain terms wants us to know that women can be just as sexually repressed, and potentially, just as unfaithful if they ever wanted to be.I'll never forget the experience of watching Eyes Wide Shut, and neither will anyone else who watches it. It's the definitive swan song of the career of a man changed cinema as we knew it.",10,1,1,18 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Space Oddity
","The Guardians are back. Bigger, badder, crazier and funnier than ever. However, how does this one size up the original? A film that surprised filmgoers everywhere and took the Marvel empire by storm as an August sleeper hit, three years ago. You can only capture that sense of discovery once, I suppose, but does that really matter in the end? Isn't the whole idea of this franchise to be a goofy, popcorn action flick that gives you more bang for your buck than most multiplexes serve up in a month? Guardians Vol. 2 does that in spades. It's unbelievable fun.All the returning characters have a real sense of longevity as to how likable and hilarious they all are. Like a family reunion, you're amazed by how much you missed them and how much they've grown. The story may seem choppy, but you're having too much fun to notice. The non-stop action made me cackle with glee. The jokes are timed perfectly. The emotional aspect of the drama scenes hit you out of nowhere, and surprisingly, moved me even more than the opening scene in the first one.Let's not forget all the little things that tie the whole thing together. Like the adorable Baby Groot's kiddy antics, cameos by Marvel legends and another blast from the past from Peter's mixtape. Chances are, if you're a millennial, you've never heard of the songs featured here. Let this be the eye opening moment, where you realize that today's music is total garbage.",8,7,12,15 May 2017
The Shape of Water," I'm in love with the Shape of you.
","When The Shape of Water started rolling the opening credits, I thought to myself, what could I have gotten myself into? Something about this particular project seemed beautiful, but completely off-putting, even in 2017. There is no secret as to what this film is. A semi-erotic romance picture about a woman and an amphibian humanoid. You might say it's Guillermo del Toro's Beauty and the Beast, as put through the lens of a 1950's Universal Monster Movie, or perhaps there's something more? I take it that del Toro, despite being a well-versed horror movie historian, wasn't just taking a trip down memory lane. I still can't put my finger on what, but The Shape of Water is a provoking piece of art. With all the gorgeous sets, special effects and ensemble cast, I saw the film with an audience of people that weren't necessarily pleased with what they saw. The Shape of Water is no crowd pleaser and I believe del Toro wanted it that way.The film takes place in the early 1960's. Hawkins is a mysterious figure. Elisa Esposito. A mute woman who works as a janitor at a government lab. Surrounding her is a world of stereotypes. Her partner at home is Giles, a starving artist and closeted homosexual with a tendency to hoard Key Lime pie, played impeccably by the great Richard Jenkins. Octavia Spencer plays Zelda Fuller, Elisa's loyal friend from work. Then we are introduced to Colonel Richard Strickland, the film's clear antagonist. He is our Gaston. The straight, broad shouldered, bigoted white man who discovered the poor amphibian creature, and rather than being fascinated by it, he simply wants to crush it for being different. While he's a villain that's easy to hate, there isn't much nuance to his character in comparison to Jenkins and Spencer. He's a brutish thug and that's about it. Although, I got a kick out of his candy addiction and his willingness to dislocate his blackened, gangrene-infected fingers out of anger. del Toro is a brilliant absurdist.Any time Hawkins and the creature shared screen time, either together or by themselves, I fell in love. Hawkins is a revelation. She says not a word, but projects an emotional performance louder than any acting job you saw at the movies in 2017. I couldn't keep my eyes off of her. She mesmerized me and filled my heart with joy. The creature is an odd updated version of The Creature from the Black Lagoon with fantastical healing powers and a rather nauseating way of copulating. Her romance with the creature comes from a place of loneliness. Two souls, misunderstood and rejected by the world. They were meant for each other. A love so powerful that Hawkins even strikes up the courage to sing 'You'll Never Know' to it in an unexpected musical number. On the surface, you might say the lesson of the story is 'love isn't skin deep'. True as that may be, you will never get over how odd it is to see Hawkins fall for that terrifying frog monster. But that's the point. Guillermo del Toro doesn't want you to feel aroused. He doesn't even want you to shed a tear for the protagonists. The Shape of Water is entirely a visual experience and a trip through the imagination of a world unlike ours, but placed somewhere in the not so distant past. It isn't reality or fantasy, it's that unrecognizable grey area in between. It's only up to you to figure out what it all really means.",7,24,44,20 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," Torn Apart
","Have you ever had an embarrassing failure in your life? Have you ever been told that you were so bad you'll never achieve your dreams, no matter how hard you've tried to achieve them? This is the story of every artist, successful and unsuccessful, in which they are forced to overcome the all too typical adversity of the cruel city of Los Angeles. But sometimes, when a door is slammed in your face, an even better one is opened next to you. Walk through that door. It's the door that enters The Room.Released in 2003 to the sound of crickets was perhaps the worst film of the past 50 years. A film so monumentally atrocious, it was destined to be a cult classic of Rocky Horror Picture Show proportions. Starting it's run late-nights on Adult Swim and skyrocketing into meme heaven on YouTube, The Room became a beloved cinematic train wreck and the world became fascinated with the human enigma known as Tommy Wiseau. Greg Sestero, the film's co-star leaked the juicy behind the scenes details of The Room in the hit autobiography The Disaster Artist, which revealed that the film had a more troubled and depressing backstory than anyone would've imagined. James Franco took it upon himself to bring this story to the big screen.What we get is a masterful movie about making movies. The Disaster Artist is an all-time crowning achievement in biopic history. It deserves to be recognized alongside 8 1/2, Ed Wood and Boogie Nights. I laughed uproariously as much as I felt terribly sorry for the unfortunate beautiful soul that is Tommy Wiseau. A man who wants to be famous at all costs, both literally and figuratively. A man who nearly destroys every relationship in his life to make The Room, a film that ultimately people love to hate. You can say that it's a tragic comedy that makes a mockery out of Wiseau.. that is until the scene of the film's premiere in LA. From horrified gasps to raucous cheers, The Room goes from DOA to the stuff of legend in less than 90 minutes. If ever there was a story about someone who fell face first into fame, Tommy Wiseau is the one. James Franco is phenomenal, alongside his younger brother Dave Franco (as Greg). I loved seeing these two together and the amount of heart they pour into the rocky friendship of Tommy and Greg. These are two men that love each other dearly and who's souls were meant to come together, despite the disaster (if you will) that ensued.What else can I say but.. YOU ARE TEARING ME APART!!!",10,0,2,8 December 2017
Mystic River," Clint Eastwood at his Grittiest.
","Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement in directing doesn't get much closer than Mystic River. A haunting, devastating film about the loss of innocence. Shattered worlds and broken hearts as tragedy strikes three kids from South Boston. Tim Robbins gives a frightening performance as Dave Boyle, the emotionally destroyed abuse victim and the accused murderer of a young girl. Sean Penn plays the mean, hard-shelled Jimmy Markum, who in no uncertain terms want's someone to pay for messing with his family. Penn's performance is best when he is quiet and brooding. Something about subtly, he has always done good with. When he flips his lid, I hate to say, he becomes laughable bad. Perhaps the one weak spot in an otherwise fantastic film.",8,0,0,2 January 2019
Zombieland," Death and Twinkies
","Nut up or shut up. 10 years ago, audiences everywhere fell in love with Zombieland. Consider it the American equivalent of Shaun of the Dead. Just as inventive, just as bloody and nearly as funny. Complete with a central cast that just clicked so well together, and that doesn't happen everyday. Jesse Eisenberg's clinic in neurosis acting is a grating chore to watch looking back, but here, it suits him well. Something about a wormy coward running away from zombies that want to rip him to shreds is funny. Woody Harrelson is a good laugh and a half as Tallahassee. Hard as nails, but a sucker for Twinkies. Of course, the funniest scene in the film, hands down, is the Bill Murray sequence. He's playing fan service for certain, but he comes at it with his A-Game. This is worth seeing if you haven't. I am now prepared, and I happily await the sequel coming this fall.",8,0,0,5 May 2019
The Departed," Ratted Out
","I haven't been living under a rock, and neither have I been in a coma, but I just watched The Departed for the first time. I know, where have I been? My love for Scorsese films runs so deep, how did this movie pass me by for so many years? Anyways, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when putting this on. I thought it would be some kind of worthy successor to Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino. Another Scorsese mob classic? Well, I wouldn't call it a classic. It's a very good film, i assure you, but it in no way compares to the genius of his very best films. It is hard to compare any mob film to the greatest mob film of all time, but when it's made by the same director and you notice all of these little setbacks, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed.The acting is by far the film's greatest strength, DiCaprio and Damon provide great intensity in their scenes, no matter how subtle. Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello definitely delivered the best performance. It's that same brand of craziness, and evil, that Nicholson does so well. As an interpretation of Whitey Bulger, it's pretty creative. This is much more of a grandstanding version of Whitey. Watch Black Mass, however, and you'll see a more entrancingly real portrayal of Whitey by Johnny Depp.The movie's mystery aspect had me very interested, and so did it's brilliant direction from Scorsese himself. This is, at the end of the day, an action picture. Reminded me a little of a 'Geezers with Guns'/Guy Ritchie film. Perhaps that is why I felt so differently about this film than his others. It doesn't have Scorsese's words, or even his ideas. That is kind of what draws me to his movies the most. When Marty has his own idea, and puts it to work, you can really tell the difference. His heart and soul is in the picture. Here, I think he just does an excellent job directing someone else's idea. What's sad is that this is the film that granted him his long- overdue Academy Award for best director. Really? This is the film that deserved it? Where were you all during Raging Bull?I'm being too harsh on a good film. It is a good film. Just not one that I'll think about when I think about one of my favorite directors.",7,1,2,13 January 2016
American Made," Smuggler's Rhapsody
","It's been advertised as another dopey Tom Cruise action movie. In reality, American Made is the true story of Barry Seal given the full GoodFellas treatment. Yes, this film is in the tradition of such Scorsese inspired biopics of the past decade. It shares the political intrigue of War Dogs, the border smuggling decadence of Blow, the high octane energy of The Wolf of Wall Street and the comedic chops of The Big Short. It's deja-vu for sure, but who the hell cares? Real life is a Scorsese movie. Deal with it.You will sit back and giggle with glee as this is, evidently, the best thing Tom Cruise has been involved with in years. He soars as Barry Seal. He captures the 'aw-shucks' naiveté of a southern airline pilot way in over his head in a massive CIA conspiracy that at least 4 U.S. Presidents were complicit in. American Made takes no prisoners as it mocks political corruption and hypocrisy. But like GoodFellas and all the biopics after it, it tells the timeless story of just how far man will go to achieve unspeakable riches and the fatal cost of it all. Doug Liman makes the film fast and loose, especially on the cutting room floor. Between shaky, documentary style cinematography are countless archival clips from news reports, presidential speeches, pop-culture and even mock VHS recordings of Barry himself. Everything moves at lightning speed. This is a biopic for the age of the smartphone. You won't be distracted by anything. Fall 2017 has already proved to be a comeback season for moviegoers and American Made has already fallen under the radar in favor of other great films. Don't miss it.",9,1,6,10 October 2017
The Witch," Cult of the Occult.
","The future of horror is here. Thy name is Robert Eggers. The Witch is close to being a perfect modern horror film. Reminiscent of classics from the mid-20th century, The Witch pushes the boundaries of what a film can accomplish, psychologically and visually, in scaring you. This is eye's wide open terror. You can hear it, you can smell it, you can feel it. Matched with performances that are all around breathtaking. Anya Taylor-Joy shocks the senses in her feature debut. Ralph Ineson as William is absolutely earth shattering. His booming, shivering voice praying to God for mercy will haunt you for days. The deeper we get into the curse of witches, as they inflict on this poor family, the darker and deadlier of a fate it becomes. None of us are spared either. Thomasin gives into the curse by the film's end, and by proxy, so do we all. In that sense, it's not as scary as it is hypnotic. But once you reenter the real world after your screening of The Witch will the dread of what you just watched overcome you. Boom. That's how you do Horror.",9,5,8,11 August 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Un-Immaculate Conception
","One of the all-time, classic thrillers of American cinema. It's, as many people have said in passing in regards to the film, the un-immaculate conception of the Antichrist on an innocent married woman. But the story isn't that simple. The great director, Roman Polanski, keeps you second guessing yourself the whole time. Is it all the work of witch craft? or is Rosemary just crazy? Was her visit from the devil just a dream? or did it really happen? You're left on edge, until the very end, when it all tragically makes sense. Polanski's direction is startlingly good. The dream sequence is nearly the best scene in the whole picture. It demonstrates Polanski merging his avant-garde roots within his first contemporary American film. Such creepy fun.",8,0,0,25 June 2015
Jersey Boys," Oh, What a Night.
","Clint Eastwood and show-tunes. Who would have thought? Jersey Boys came and went in 2014. It's one of the lost films of the 2010's. Was it because it was so bad? It's not that bad. It's like a cross between Dreamgirls and A Bronx Tale. The music is fantastic, as you'd expect. The storyline, while corny and a bit disheveled in tone, is easy to follow and hits right home when it needs to. Hearing Frankie Valli's 'My Eye's Adored You' at his daughter's funeral left me with a lump in my throat. That's a powerful moment that needed it's one-two punch for viewers, and thankfully, we get that. My biggest issue is it's acting. At times, the boys are way over the top. The climax in particular is a treasure trove of embarrassingly bad acting. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a nice little movie.",6,0,0,18 January 2020
Steve Jobs," iMovie
","Unlike The Social Network, Steve Jobs isn't a feature length thriller. It's more like a concept album. Through three separate Apple launches within the span of 15 years, Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin explore the financial, cultural and spiritual evolution of Steve Jobs, the man behind the Mac. But a flawed man he was. Through mostly dialogue alone, Jobs is pried by his associates, superiors and loved ones. At times, Jobs feels soulless, and constantly focused on the finished product he is selling at the moment. Each section differs in which camera equipment it was filmed on. Act 1 is 16mm film, Act 2 is 35mm film, and Act 3 is digital. Not a bad touch by Boyle. This, stylistically, properly departs from Fincher's gloomy world of Facebook. Sorkin's screenplay is as richly developed as ever, but at times, emotionally empty. Sorkin loves the smell of his own farts. It shows. Every character kind of sounds the same. In any event, Steve Jobs, the movie, has a specific mission. To tell the story of one man, his extraordinary product, and his extraordinary mind using as little visuals as possible. Luckily, it succeeds.",8,0,0,25 May 2020
Sausage Party," A Feast.
","I promise you that this review won't have any food-related puns. It would've been easy had the film not used up of every last one that you could think of.Every now and then someone in Hollywood has the balls to make an animated feature strictly for adults. By every now and then, I mean whenever Matt & Trey feel up to it, which they haven't been in more than a decade... and how many years has it been since The Simpsons Movie? I already forget. Perhaps it's because of how hard it is to advertise. You just can't. It's hard to tell a child that they can't go see a colorful, friendly looking cartoon, of any kind, even if that cartoon contains an egregious amount of F-bombs, provocative religious/political satire and sex jokes.But Seth Rogen took it upon himself to make one of his own, and after years of rejection from the major studios, we finally have Sausage Party. It is as outrageous, vile, demented, perverted and hilarious as we all dreamed it would be. It ranks with Blazing Saddles, South Park, Team America and Ted in the genre of films that push the non-PC envelope as far as it can go. This film takes no prisoners. The food products live in a racist world where nobody gets along, and worship every kind of crazy religion under the sun... yeah, kind of like our world. Behind it is a message of tolerance, and an even bigger message of the absurdity of organized religion. At this very moment, we needed something like this to come along. Even though I am a Catholic, I appreciated it's daring atheism. It seems like religion is the cause of everything terrible in the world right now. Nothing makes sense anymore. I understand where this little sausage is coming from.But as deep as the film could be, it's as gross and as stupid as any Seth Rogen comedy in past. But even that's an understatement. It even pushes boundaries on that level. This film has the most hilariously gross ending of any movie I've seen in years. The food all get together and have an orgy. Once you see it, you cannot un-see it. You have been warned, folks.",8,23,49,12 August 2016
There Will Be Blood," You Will Be Amazed.
","Many people consider this the magnum opus of P.T.A. Many others call it the greatest film of the 2000's. Has it stood the test of time? Are they right? Well, lets face it, P.T.A. is one of the most incredible directors of the last 50 years, in my opinion. Considering most of his early films were overlooked, I'm content with how much respect this one has. Because, simply put, it's a masterpiece. An American epic, of the same caliber as Citizen Kane. It's a study on the effects of greed, and how the rise to power can sometimes completely corrupt and demonize the human spirit. Daniel Day Lewis.. it goes without saying, but this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano is also equally amazing, but unfortunately stands in the shadows of DDL. It's also, filmed so masterfully, as if Kubrick rose from the grave. In fact, the whole thing really reminded me of an Orson Wells/Stanley Kubrick hybrid. As different as his films remain in retrospect, expect nothing but the absolute best from a P.T.A film.",10,0,2,7 February 2015
Joker," Joker's Wild
","2019 America is crazy enough to prepare us for Joker, and yet none of us were. In recent memory, there hasn't been a theatrical experience that has generated this much fear, anxiety and excitement as this one has. That's because Joker seems real. All too real for many people. There have been many films in the past that study the deranged and unstable in our society. Joker even pays homage to many of those films. But what was once just morbid curiosity in art has become a grim and horrifying reality for the American people. A never-ending string of mass-shootings and terrorist attacks have shaped our crumbling civil society. It leaves people shattered enough to see a film like Joker in an entirely different light. The times we live in will forever define the kind of film this is. Make no mistake, Joker is a dangerous film. It's the most subversive film to come along since Natural Born Killers. Yet, for this fact alone, Joker is an unparalleled cinematic event. Not to mention, it's pretty damn good.It's the would-be origin story of Batman's archenemies, placed in a version of Gotham that resembles New York City's not-so-distant past. The Joker's real name is Arthur Fleck, who lives with his ailing mother in a dingy apartment. By day, he's a rent-a-clown, twirling signs outside of closing department stores. But Arthur can't catch a break. In fact, his life is a living hell. He gets beat up in the streets, ridiculed at open mic nights, struggles with meeting women, barely comes home with enough money for food and frequently embarrasses himself by laughing uncontrollably due to a neurological disorder. Meanwhile, as Gotham continues it's decay, a billionaire tycoon with a familiar name rises in politics. Unfortunately for Arthur, he shares a shameful connection with him that his mother never bothered to disclose. Eventually, Arthur snaps. A rough run-in with three boorish Wall Street brokers ends with a Bernie Goetz style bloodbath on the subway, and from there, it's off to the races. Arthur's misery begins to melt away. Suddenly, he comes alive by inflicting merciless violence on the people that have done him wrong. If that wasn't bad enough, the unwashed city dwellers of Gotham find an unlikely hero in Arthur for having stood up to the rich, and unintentionally starts a violent class uprising capable of bringing whatever's left of Gotham to it's knees.Todd Phillips dares to go where nobody ever wanted to with comic book villains. He has sympathy for the devil. To him, the Joker is a victim of circumstance, jaded and destroyed from a cruel world that has beaten him down one too many times. It's a role that demands tenderness from a sad and empty young man, and a breaking point that transforms him into a cesspool of senseless evil. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the greatest performance he's ever given here, in the greatest performance of 2019, and maybe even the decade itself. He breaks your heart and frightens you to the core. He portrays a genuinely real depiction of mental illness, that dares you into understanding it. Every last quivering bit of it. When he laughs, it doesn't feel maniacal and sinister. Instead, it sounds like a pained cry for help. A man completely helpless in controlling himself. You want to tear up just watching it. Yet, when he crosses into the dark side, all of that sympathy washes away, and in it's place comes loathing and fear. Fleck becomes an agent of chaos, with throngs of adoring fans at his feet. In other words, he finally became somebody.Joker is centimeters from a perfect film. It would be, albeit, if you've never seen Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. It's impossible to watch this movie and overlook the clear as day tributes and similarities. Todd Phillips is a massive Scorsese fanboy. I've known that since War Dogs, which was an Iraq War copy of GoodFellas. In that sense, we aren't getting a uniquely original piece of work in the story behind Joker, and yet Phillips makes it work tremendously within the setting of the famous world of DC Comics. From there, recycled ideas become something new, and through a contemporary lens, this premise has been given a meaning to audiences as shocking now as Taxi Driver was then. Arthur is Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin and Howard Beale all rolled into one psychotic package.Joker is no laughing matter. It's a landmark in comic book lore, and an important story to tell in film history. Believe the hype. Send in the clowns.",9,8,16,6 October 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Nuclear Explosion of Drugs, Sex and Greed
","There is probably no other movie you could find that better captures decadence in the world of the extremely wealthy quite like 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. A film that might not stand among the ranks of 'Goodfellas', 'Taxi Driver', 'The Departed' or even 'Gangs of New York' as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, but stands among the very best of 2013. Its a mess, but what an exhilarating mess it is. A 3-hour epic of gluttonous drug-use and explicit sex as documented by a truly repulsive human being. The fact is, this is how the workplace functioned back in the early 90's. The fact is, Jordan Belfort consumed more Quaaludes to make Hunter S. Thompson blush and engaged in enough ravenous sexual escapades to make Caligula faint. It seems almost unbelievable to assume that these events actually occurred, but to some degree, they did. If that is the case, then Scorsese truly crafted a masterful biopic. DiCaprio embodies Jordan Belfort perfectly. He soars far beyond any performance in film this year. Jonah Hill is also mesmerizing as Jordan's partner in crime, Donnie Azoff, who is a certified pig. Matthew McConaughey especially steals the show as Mark Hanna, a meticulous master of the stocks, with a strange habit of beating his chest to something similar to an Indian tribal chant. The female love interest Naomi, played by Margot Robbie, plays it sexy and cunning as a really charming tramp who mothers Belfort's child. The rest plays out as you would expect. Its a long, dizzying journey of T and A with copious amounts of cocaine sprinkled on top. But its a journey that is worth taking. Bravo to Scorsese, DiCaprio and everyone involved in the creation of this masterpiece.",10,5,14,8 January 2014
It Chapter Two," Let's Float Again.
","Trauma. It sticks with you for all of your life. What are the things you remember? Do you remember more good things than bad? When bad things happen, do they haunt you forever? These are the questions that It: Chapter Two confronts. Pennywise isn't just some scary clown. As Stephen King's horror epic suggests, he's a metaphor for childhood trauma and how to overcome it. In reality, many people are incapable of overcoming trauma. But for fiction's sake, it makes for a better and more rewarding story to imagine our protagonists (The Losers) coming together to defeat it. If you can't escape the clown.. kick it's ass.It: Chapter Two is not packing the same punch with audiences as the first one did. For starters, it's nearly three hours long. With a runtime like that, you'd better hope that you've made one of the greatest horror films of all time. But as I sat and watched, those hours raced by. Forgive me, but I had a ball. It's a night of dumb horror fun if nothing else. But the amount of character development is not too shabby either. Bill Hader kills it as adult Richie. Hilarious, and at times, heartfelt. Everyone else brings their all from McAvoy to Chastain. The scares are plentiful. Most of them land perfectly. Although, oddly enough, many are played for laughs. I found myself cackling at some of Pennywise's antics, whereas last time, he just creeped me out. That's a jarring difference for sure, but it almost harkens back to Tim Curry's classic performance, and that's something I can appreciate. If narratively speaking, this film follows the same beats as the first film, remember, that's because its the same book divided in two. It isn't supposed to break new ground. Are certain things about this film sloppy? Sure. Could it have used a trim? Maybe? But what we get in mistakes, we are overcompensated in thrills.So in terms of the snark this film is facing, I just don't understand it. Count me out as a naysayer. My bottom line is fun. Scare me, thrill me, make me laugh and keep me invested the entire time. It: Chapter Two does that with little clown horns on it's feet. It kept me liking it for 169 minutes. How many films can do that?",8,4,7,8 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," A Pretty-Looking Dud
","The Coen brothers have done just about everything right for most of their careers. Their line of work is diverse, and fabulously off-beat. They find the humor and horror of both real and absurd situations. Hail, Caesar must be another hit, right? I sat through most of the film beside myself. It's a tribute to post-war, old-Hollywood, which is great and all.. but this was marketed as a comedy, and I never laughed. Where were the jokes? The irony? There is plenty of humor to be had at this bygone era, and the Coens didn't explore. The film relies heavily on perfectly constructed, whimsical set pieces and the pretty faces of it's all-star ensemble cast. Glitz and glamour only takes a film so far. If the story and characters are hollow, everything else will be. The critics adored this when it came out last year, which just goes to show you how much these old fossils love gushing over themselves and the industry they represent. This is not one of the Coen's finer hours. I guess if i didn't like this, I better never consider watching Rules Don't Apply? Yeah, sounds like a good idea to me.",4,1,2,14 March 2017
Dark Shadows," Pretension Only Goes So Far
","Dark Shadows tries with all its might to be as quirky, spooky and ironic as possible. But I couldn't agree more with what most of the critics have said, and I quote, 'All dressed up, and nowhere to go'. To be honest, I thought that this was going to be one of Burton's most original outings since the mid-nineties. I was looking forward to the juxtaposition of groovy nostalgia and Universal classic horror movie monsters that this film promised. But once I pressed play, those hopes were quickly dashed. Its another pretentious Burton schlock-fest with over the top weirdness, over bearing set pieces, uninteresting dialog and of course, Johnny Depp stinking up the joint. I should have known that Dark Shadows was such an appealing franchise for Burton to get his greasy hands on. Nothing in this film is genuinely compelling or funny. However, the homages to the 70's (as little in quantity as they were), were at least semi- amusing. Tim needs to learn at some point or another that his 20 year Depp collabo is wearing extremely thin. Perhaps the film's box-office returns gave some sort of a clue.",3,2,4,29 December 2013
Kingpin," Bowled Me Over
","Funny movies are good for these trying times. Kingpin is really funny movie. It's from The guys who made Dumb and Dumber, yet it has more in common with Airplane! The Farrelly Bros. didn't just bring their all with this, they threw in the kitchen sink. Kingpin is a laugh a minute kind of movie, and though so much time has gone by, the laughs still stick. It's high caliber, low-brow comedy, as the Farrelly Bros. so wonderfully mastered. It's also home to one of the all time greatest Bill Murray performances. Ernie McCracken is the Ron Burgundy of bowling, and i wouldn't have mind seeing his spin-off. It would have been a lot better than what they just recently did with The Jesus from The Big Lebowski. Yikes.",9,0,1,23 March 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Kong's Last Roar
","How many times can they really do King Kong? King Kong 76'? OK. King Kong 05' with Peter Jackson? I can dig that. Kong: Skull Island is pushing it. This might be the flimsiest King Kong film to date. It reinvents nothing. Sure, there isn't a blonde woman being kidnapped, and sure there isn't a scene where Kong climes up a skyscraper.. but not relying on the tropes of the series doesn't excuse the unimaginative storyline here. It's aesthetic is a Vietnam war film. CCR blasts the soundtrack. You know where this is going. The characters are wooden. The only thing they've got going for them is their star power. John Goodman does a good job as always. John C. Reilly is a treat to see. However, Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson.. again. Also, the jumps scares.. why? Why is Hollywood still relying on jump scares in the horror/sci-fy genre? I'm sick of it. The sound dies down and BOOM a creature pops out. This happens a dozen times here. Enough. The effects in Kong are as good as they should be, but it's certainly not a standout. The new Planet of the Apes series is truly wowing with realistic looking apes. This film could've learned a thing or two. Also, just in case you're wondering about what I think of the post-credits surprise.. here's my answer: Sorry, Warner Bros. I'm not interested.",5,2,5,13 March 2017
Arrival," We've Made Contact
","Another alien invasion movie you say? Haven't we all seen this before? Close Encounters, Independence Day, War of the Worlds.. etc. They came from the heavens, and they either want to help us or take over the world. What's the big deal about Arrival. See it for yourselves, and look closer. Something utterly fascinating has been achieved by Denis Villeneuve, who is now a three- time hit maker. It's all about communication, and the meaning of life. A linguist goes through a journey of interpreting the peculiar written language of the alien creatures, which sort of resembles the Rorschach test. She discovers along the way that she can see into the future, and foretell what happens in her life long after the aliens leave.The film is something to behold. Villeneuve does an incredible job directing once again, with outstanding cinematography by Bradford Young and a masterful score by the GREAT Johann Johannsson. Amy Adams is as breathtaking as ever in the starring role, accompanied by great performances by Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker. It's a head scratcher, and that's a good thing indeed.",7,1,6,21 November 2016
The Big Short," Wall Street's still Occupied
","It's the Financial Crisis of 2008, for dummies. Well, you can still call me a dummy. As the film rambles on using investment banker jargon, and shortly stopping to explain to you what all of it means using a whole host of celebrity cameos, my mind was still a jumble.You better believe that this film is one hell of a ride. It's one of the best directed films of the year. Adam McKay, who an absolute comedic genius by reputation, comes out of nowhere with this slam-dunk of a drama. Even when you're lost in it's web of politics, you are still ridiculously entertained by it's style.McKay, whether or not he is fully successful at it, has made a film that attempts to put one of the most complicated events in American history into terms accessible to the layman. He uses a lot fourth wall breaking, pop culture, and quite an abundance of floating texts to make it so. Scorsese seems to be the biggest influence, and The Wolf of Wall Street, seems to be the template to which this film tells us a side story about this most greediest of streets. Among a colorful cast is some of the best performances of the year by Steve Carell as a feisty, Bernie Sanders-esque ex-banker, and Christian Bale as Michael Burry.. a man worth devoting an entire movie on himself. It looks like a 5-star movie, and yet, something about The Big Short, slightly, falls short.A lot of people have said that McKay may have been way over his head when it comes to achieving his political message, and yes, I can see that. McKay is a seasoned comic, but he badly wants to be the next Michael Moore. That's kind of a dangerous road to go down, in his case. Because, let's face it, you can't get onto a soapbox, and invite your white, rich, elitist, Hollywood friends to get on with you. Nobody wants to listen to it anymore. Hollywood is not in touch with the rest of the world, and neither are politicians. I don't think I would've been left with this impression had the movie not ended on a self-righteous note. If McKay and the entire cast feel the way they feel about the inequities of the system, maybe they need to put their money where their mouths are, and skip out on the limousine ride to the premiere. Maybe they ought to walk down a lonely LA street and greet a bunch of adoring fans, whom could really be down on their luck.Does this limit my absolute praise of the picture? Sure. But on all other accounts, The Big Short is an absolutely stunning thing to behold. In many sections, it had me laughing out loud, and clinging to the edge of my seat. I love this style of filmmaking, without a doubt. When any film begins to recognize it's audience, and throws a wink their way, I just love it. McKay has studied well from the Godard handbook he's also studied the ever-living hell out of investment banking. My God, his mind is like a steel trap of banking.",7,2,6,23 December 2015
The Conjuring," The Haunting of James Wan
","The Conjuring is the scariest, and most effective supernatural horror film of this decade, and maybe even this century. James Wan is a student of horror. He's seen films like The Exorcist, Poltergeist and The Amityville Horror. He knows what makes them tick and what makes them scary. Timing is the key. Ghost stories are all about it. In supernatural horror, you need to treat it's production, every last phase of it, as if it is haunted itself. Wan has this down to a science, and for his efforts, he created a modern day screamer. In the summer of 2013, this was the talk of the film world. Everyone who saw it, in a dark theatre, had the same experience. A film so effectively frightening, you either looked away from the screen or you jumped out of your chair. Anyone who elicits this kind of response from an audience is a master in their own way. Mired in our unfortunate realities, it takes a lot to scare people these days. The Conjuring is a scary movie, period. That's why it works.",9,0,1,26 August 2019
Platoon," When the Machine Breaks Down...
","In Vietnam, the only war these men were fighting were themselves. Platoon is a treasured war picture about the Vietnam war. It's Oliver Stone's explosive debut as a big league filmmaker. Powerful and courageous was he to capture the inhumanity of the war, and it's affects on the average American soldier. Some are overtaken by it. These themes are familiar in Vietnam war movies, and shall I say, done significantly better. The one man account of the confused and hopeless nature of the war is far more effective in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The war's barbarity was captured more accurately in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Platoon by comparison falls into the issues of the formulaic. But big credit goes to performances by Willem Dafoe and Tom Bringer as the tyrannical and sadistic Sergeant Barnes.",7,2,5,30 September 2019
Marriage Story," You've Been Served.
","Marriage Story is an amazing film. It's Noah Baumbach's best film. It's a film about divorce.Those three statements are completely unexpected, and I'm thrilled to be saying them. Reminiscent of 70's tearjerkers like Kramer Vs. Kramer, with a pinch of Annie Hal, Baumbach has delivered his most emotionally complete and competently structured film to date, that effectively grips you into the story of these two characters, and the fractured family that they represent. Nicole and Charlie are flawed people, but really decent. They hate each other at all. They'd do anything for their son. But their passions for their art got in the way of a pitch perfect marriage. This is not a couple that should be getting divorced, but they are. Baumbach's message is clear, and poignant. Marriage is a difficult thing. Not everyone is cut out for it. Even people who love each other tremendously aren't meant to be together forever. But even when divorces begin amicably, it's inevitable that it creates an emotional fracture between the respective partners that can rarely be reconciled. In other words, it's heartbreaking. We really root for Charlie and Nicole throughout. We painfully watch them come further apart, when we wish they wouldn't.Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver give phenomenal performances here. The fight scene between the two of them, as per the climax, is an acting masterclass for the ages. The way they emotionally unravel in front of us is impressively real. Like a true marriage on the outs. The entire film is riveting. Near perfect, has it not been for Charlie's musical number towards the end that felt over-indulgent and pretentious. Noah, you need to get out your own way.",9,0,2,10 December 2019
Vanilla Sky," What?
","Vanilla Sky is what happens when a great director wins an award, gets surrounded by Yes men, and gets the opportunity to have full reign of his dream project. This has vanity project written all over it. It's just gobbledygook. I understand why people hate this movie. Cameron Crowe really didn't care if this movie polarized his audience, and it astoundingly did so. But, the people that liked it, to my estimation, either looked into it too deeply, understood it's intentions or just laughed at how utterly incomprehensible it was. I gave it a chance, and I was oddly entertained by it. At times I couldn't believe what I was watching, but I had to keep going. I feel aggravated, but accomplished for having watched it. Cameron Crowe has unfortunately never made a decent movie again after this. You can see that it's his tipping point. Pretension and sticky saccharine gloop practically are pouring out of the seams, about to burst. I'd like to get a Life Extension, and dream that Cameron Crowe still makes good movies like Almost Famous.",5,1,3,20 July 2015
Any Given Sunday," Touchdown.
","Either Oliver Stone is a HUGE football fan, or he deeply studied it in order to make Any Given Sunday the best made film about football ever. Through the standpoint of editing alone, Any Given Sunday is a masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's high energy, rock n' roll cinema. The kind that Oliver Stone is so famous for. Blink and you'll miss it. A film, truly, for the MTV generation. It's filled with tremendous performances as well. Al Pacino is in classic form as Tony. Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx and James Woods are spellbinding throughout. Everybody, behind and in front of the camera let nothing go to waste here. It's an underrated sports film and 90's film, in my view.",8,1,2,28 March 2020
Mother!," Moab (Mother of all Box-Office Bombs)
","These days, we live in a world where most things are terrible and don't make any sense. Yet, a film like Mother! can still come along and disgust audiences. A film so off-putting, Rex Reed declared it 'The worst film of the century'. Make no mistake, Mother! is a profoundly polarizing film. But that is only because it went mainstream. It stars mainstream actors. It's distributed by Paramount. In recent years, the art-house and the multiplex have never crossed paths. But as the era of the blockbuster fades away, it was only a matter of time for Hollywood to return back to it's roots. To bring us back to the late 1960's, where most films meant something. Films that grab you. Films that push serious boundaries. I rarely leave a theater shaken. But Mother! did just that. It is a beautiful, terrifying assault on your senses.Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem play a lovely couple. Bardem is a struggling poet, while Lawrence tends to her house obsessively. Everything seems fine on the surface. What's that, you ask? The house has a heart! I admit the deed! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It's the beating of his hideous heart! ... and scene. Thank you for indulging me. No seriously, the house has a heart.. and internal organs. It's a living entity. I heard of the phrase 'Home is where the heart is' but this is ridiculous. Is it? Lawrence plays someone that wants to be a mother to something. Her house? What happens when adoring fans come rushing in to see Bardem? Unwelcome visitors all! They wreck the house and impede on Lawrence's hard work. This must not go on. To fill the void, Bardem and Lawrence conceive a child. As the days go on, the guest list becomes bigger and bigger. By the film's midpoint, the house becomes a small city of thieves and squatters. After that, I must not share anymore. Because if you're already confused by what I'm telling you.. you don't know what confused is, my friend.How does one interpret Mother! It's the quintessential art-house/midnight movie. Therefore, anything is plausible. Aronofsky intended it that way. He juggles many concepts and critiques about life itself. Motherhood, paranoia, fame, claustrophobia, selfishness, lust, rage, war, peace, religion, gender, history.. Mother! is whatever you want it to be and more. If you know that going in, this will be a breeze. If you don't, you will loathe every second of this film and I won't blame you. It is a lot to swallow. The climax of the picture is well orchestrated insanity. Arguably, the most intense sequence of events captured on screen since Children of Men. By comparison, Requiem for a Dream is almost entirely palpable. You sit back in your seat and think 'Enough already. This is too much. Wow. It's not stopping. Please stop.'. But that is precisely the point. Aronofsky does not let up until you are mentally drained from watching. But at least to ease some of the pain, you see a lot of Jennifer Lawrence's face, up-close. Most of the film is on her face. In real life, she is in a relationship with Aronofsky. Coincidence? No, not a coincidence. This is the mark of a filmmaker madly in love with his star. On an emotional level, that shows.Mother! is not a film to go into blind.. but that certainly helps the experience. Polarizing, disturbing films are not crowd pleasures by any stretch, but that's never been an area that bothers me. Films like these fascinate me. Their lack of decorum fascinates me. The reactions from the audience fascinate me. On Lars Von Trier's best day, he couldn't have conjured a film like Mother! .. and if he did, he would've have let it be seen in a shopping mall.",9,327,620,16 September 2017
Moonrise Kingdom," Heir to the Throne
","Truly, if you've seen one Wes Anderson film, you've seen them all. Moonrise Kingdom is just one of the many deadpan classics of the Anderson catalogue. Nobody can set up a frame better than him. Nobody could write a script as eclectic. Nobody can make better use of a cast of Hollywood favorites. Moonrise Kingdom has all of what we love about Wes Anderson and more. The coming- of-age tale fits his universe fantastically. He knows how to make the conventional seem completely unconventional. Sometimes, it's too quirky for it's own good. But that is the risk you take with Wes Anderson. Either you get it, or you don't.",8,1,1,9 December 2017
The Sixth Sense," Spine-Tingling
","'I see dead people'M. Night Shyamalan's first and most successful hour of his cinematic career was The Sixth Sense. A film that accomplishes, if nothing else, pure spookiness. Take any child, and give them supernatural abilities, and you've got a damn good recipe of freaking people out. Haley Joel Osment was an exceptionally great, mature actor for his age, which is what made this role even better. He compliments well with a quiet and calculative Bruce Willis. It's a fascinating story worthy of a Twilight Zone episode. But I don't believe that this is the best film of Shyamalan's catalogue. On more than one occasion during the span of the film, I noticed some of the dreaded trips of Shyamalan films that proved to be problematic later on in his career. I know, some of you out there love this movie, but go back and look closely. They are all still there. The 'twist' of this film, suffice to say has been spoiled for me years ago. But even if it wasn't, I would NEVER have not seen it coming from the very beginning. That scene with Donnie Wahlberg as the opener is way too jarring and bizarre for it not to have meant something later on.",7,1,1,14 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I've got a good feeling about this.
","The force is strong with this one.Star Wars is back. For real this time. The days of lamenting the disappointment of the prequels are over. At the helm is J.J Abrams, and his mission was to bring back the Star Wars of his childhood. Guess what? He did it. Looking back on all the episodes, and taking everything into account, this is definitely the best one since Empire Strikes Back. It's one of those movies that is so good, you won't know what hit you until days later. At the core of it, is pure nostalgia. The return of Han, Chewie, Leia, C3PO and R2-D2 is a real heart warmer. Fans of the original trilogy will NOT be disappointed. The new heroes, Finn and Rey, fit perfectly into this universe. They have the same warm, scrappy camaraderie that the original gang captured nearly 40 years ago. The new villain, Kylo Ren, is like a millennial Darth Vader.. and no, don't take that as a criticism. It's a new brand of the dark side, that might even be darker than ever. OK, that's all I'm going to say. Because, well, so much happens in this, and so much is barely known about what this film is about until you actually see it.Just go see it. See it on the biggest screen you can. This is the movie event of the year.",8,1,15,19 December 2015
Casino," Goodfellas 2.0
","If you've seen GoodFellas, chances are, you don't really need to see Casino. But it's a masterpiece, nonetheless, so why not? It stands as one of Scorsese's longest movies, only beaten by 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. But just like 'Wolf', this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat, for a whopping 3 hours, never losing it's intensity for a second. Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her. It's Scorsese's oldest tactic, which is to make you interested in awful people, and perhaps seeing the traits of them that are overlooked. Casino isn't Scorsese's best film, but it is a truly memorable, and watchable one.",9,0,1,7 February 2015
Deadpool," Funniest Marvel Movie Ever
","This is the funniest superhero movie of all time. The funniest of it's own sub-genre, of a sub- genre. 'Marvel comedies.' Guardians, Ant-Man and now this. Screamingly funny. Ryan Reynolds couldn't have been a better a choice for Deadpool. Well, maybe if you dunked Jim Carrey into the fountain of youth, he would've probably been able to blow everyone else away. Speaking of, that's what this whole thing kind of reminded me of. Deadpool is the Ace Ventura of superheroes. He wins any battle by being a total clown. Not only is Deadpool a joker, but this whole movie throws a pie at the Superhero renaissance of this decade. Every cliché and plot device gets their ass handed to them. I would say it breaks the fourth wall, but that would mean that there is a wall here to begin with, and there is none. Winter is a dead zone for movies, but this is worthy enough to be a summer blockbuster. Let's get a sequel going!",8,7,20,13 February 2016
The Hangover Part III," An inconsequential end to a deteriorating franchise
","The Hangover Part III is one of those movies that I forgot about merely seconds after the end credits started to roll. I thought what I had just seen was a mirage of some sort. A comedy so unbelievably weak that it cannot simply serve as the end to one of the wildest saga of comedy movies ever made. But alas, there is just no way around how bad this final Hangover really is. When the first film debuted in 2009, it opened to mixed critical reviews but to a strong word of mouth consensus amongst its audience and became one of the biggest unexpected hits of the year. It launched the careers of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifinakis from comedic players to top billing superstars. It was an even bigger hit on DVD, and a sequel was already in the works. The future really did look bright for comedy, and for Todd Phillips as his directorial career had now found itself in a massive resurgence. Then, when the sequel debuted in 2011, audiences from across the country piled into movie theaters in hopes of another summer laugh riot. These hopes were quickly dashed when it was realized that the Hangover Part II was a carbon copy of the original. It was one of the biggest disappointments in comedy since Ghostbusters 2, but it did supply us with a few memorable quotes and inspired insanity if nothing else. Now, we have The Hangover Part III. The question remains, why does it even exist? Who was asking for it? I couldn't name anyone who wanted anything to do with the Hangover after its disastrous second part. But, there it was, Hangover III. Whether you like it or not, your getting it. Whats more is that it isn't even remotely similar to the two movies prior to it. In fact, there's no hangover to be found at any point in this film (minus the end credits). Quite contradictory to the title, or even the WHOLE PURPOSE of the franchise! Yeah, I guess Todd Phillips and co. were so terrified with what they received with the second movie, that they insisted on abandoning everything that constituted a Hangover movie and instead leave the memorable characters to revel in black comedy and senseless melodrama. If you can believe it, this movie is even more black than its sequel (and that movie included jokes about cocaine overdoses and the victims of the Vietnam war). Yes, we are forced to focus on the mad inner workings of Alan's mind, and why he is a burden to society and everyone close to him. Alan was once the most lovable inappropriate man-child the world has ever seen. Now, I wanted to strap him down and pluck every last whisker from his beard. We also focus on Leslie Chow's crazy antics again because. well LOOK ITS CHOW AGAIN!!! He's so crazy, right? Everything else is just flavorless and boring. Even Melissa McCarthy can't save this mess. I'll admit that a few of the jokes made me laugh in a twisted Terry Zwigoff sort of way. But other than a few of the dark jokes. there's nothing really that enjoyable about this Hangover. So we bid thee, farewell. I don't think we'll miss you, Wolfpack.",3,1,2,29 December 2013
Jackie Brown," A Different Tarentino
","When you think of Quentin Tarentino, you think of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained. But never, in conversation about his works, is Jackie Brown ever really discussed. It seems that Jackie Brown has always been the black sheep of Tarentino's legacy. It didn't even make a decent amount of money in its theatrical run. Surprising, because with the phenomenon of Pulp Fiction, you would think that moviegoers would line up for blocks to catch this flick on opening weekend. But we all knew he wasn't going to top what he did before. Making a movie better than Pulp Fiction is an impossible task. But thats not what Tarentino was going for. Tarentino wanted to take a break from his violent roots and prove himself as a filmmaker by making a smart, sexy crime caper along the lines of Ocean's Eleven. Not only did he meet his goal, he exceeded it. The cast is near perfect, delivering some of the best performances in any Tarentino film. Pam Grier channels her old bad-ass acting career while at the same time being who she really is, making her performance so raw and dangerously cool. Robert Forster's performance was truly moving, capturing his unrequited love for Jackie so subtly, conveying it powerfully in every shot of his time on screen. Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson as always. Bridget Fonda is absolutely steaming. All except for Robert DeNiro. I couldn't get used to him playing the blithering idiot he is on screen. It made me a little uncomfortable, considering that he is a powerhouse of an actor and this role forced him to take a huge leap backwards. But I guess, somehow, its pretty cool to see him play someone else. Whats restraining me from giving this a perfect score is the movie as a whole. It just doesn't feel like a movie directed by Quentin. His body and soul is just not present here, other than his penchant for witty dialog and an impressive soundtrack. I guess I was disappointed as much people were when the film debuted. We wanted more, we expected so much, and we were let down. Jackie Brown will always stand in the shadows of Quentin's other films, but don't let that be a reason to never see it. Watch it from beginning to end and embrace it as an excellent film, not his film.",8,0,2,26 March 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Let's not go to Camelot. It's a Silly Place.
","Where would comedy be without Monty Python? Well, we wouldn't have had South Park, The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Tim and Eric, Arrested Development, Saturday Night Live, Anchorman, The Office, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Airplane!, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Invader Zim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and every stupid internet meme ever made. That's quite a lot of things. To the troupe of bloaks who revolutionized comedy by not giving a single F about making sense, we are forever in your debt.This brings us to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. One of the classic comedy movies of the 20th century every film lover must see before they die. You'll either get it, or you won't. You'll either laugh uproariously or scratch your head. Whatever you think of it, you can't argue that it represented an important moment in cinema, comedy, acting and the entire art of storytelling. The world was introduced to absurdism and this film crashes it down on you with it's bare feet.. *Python fans will understand that reference*. What you've got is the entire Monty Python gang dressed up in horrible medieval costumes, prancing about the countryside of England, making a farce of 6th century British history and loving every minute of it. The guerrilla nature of how they put this film together is a total inspiration. By today's standards, this film could have easily been made during a long weekend by a bunch of high school kids on their phones. Monty Python made it all possible. They taught us that jokes don't even necessarily have to be funny in order to be funny. If your sense of humor is as broad as mine, you will love it. If it isn't, you should see it just once and appreciate it if nothing else.",8,0,0,16 March 2019
Gangs of New York," Mean Streets
","The original Mean Streets. The real Irishmen. New York, New York, 1863. This is Scorsese's ode to the founding of our great city. A founding forged in blood, prejudice and greed. Gangs of New York is a sprawling epic, and it's impossible not to like. The city of old comes alive, in full color, on gorgeous 35mm film. The acting is as fine as any Scorsese movie can get, putting aside the legendary performance that is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting. The performance of a lifetime is more apt. He chews up every. last. scene. He is disturbingly good here. The Butcher is one of the great film villains. A ruthless killer armed and motivated by hate. This character was considered for so many great actors in it's 30 year development, but thank God in the end we were given DDL. I cant imagine anyone else in this role. What's even better is that Gangs of New York never overstays it's welcome, even at 167 minutes. Like the best of Scorsese, the quality of what you are seeing very much outweighs the heft of portion size we're getting in length. I could sit through the entirety of this film again, and even if it went on for another hour longer, i'd still be right in there. Scorsese's natural ability to tell stories on screen is unparalleled. However, all is not perfect. Rarely nothing ever is. An odd choice of music and editing, at least to me, lessens the blow and muddies up the fight scene at the beginning. It felt very 2002-ish. It dates the movie significantly.",9,7,8,30 November 2019
Joy," What's it All About, Joy?
","The first time I heard that David O. Russell was making a movie about the woman that made the Miracle Mop, I didn't really know what to think. Why is that interesting to him? Is there some kind of wild story about Joy Mangano that nobody knows about? I checked out her Wikipedia page, and it said nothing about her previous life, other than, she was a single-mom, who struggled her way to the top. It's the rags to riches story, one that we've all heard. You know, the one about the American dream. But so what? That story has been told a million times. Some of the greatest movies ever made are about that. Is this going to be another one? . It's about the Miracle Mop, how could it? What possessed the director of American Hustle to make a movie about that? Then the trailer came out, and I was even more stunned. It looked pretty damn good, but I have no idea what it was trying to say. The standout shots were Bradley Cooper smiling widely and Jennifer Lawrence shooting a shotgun in a parking lot. I don't get it, but you know what? I've got to see this thing. David O. Russell might have something really creative here.Did he? Eh, maybe he did? The verdict is, Joy is a strange movie. Everything that I wondered about it was true. It was a non-story, made out to be a big deal. There really wasn't that much to work with. The story is as small as the Wikipedia page of Joy Mangano. What Russell does instead is focusing in on the determination and strength of one woman. Joy, as insignificant as her story may be, is presented here as a female warrior. Someone, who despite every curveball society threw at her, gets up and punches back even harder. Everyone in her life tells her that the Miracle Mop is a failure, but she still pushes through and gets it on the market. As with most of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, she lead an impossible goal as hard as she could take it, and wins. Being that she is a woman, in a male-centric world, she's even more of a reason to be admired.So when you take into account the character of Joy, you allow yourself to really like this movie. However, when you look around Joy, nothing else is really there. David O. Russell has always liked making movies about multiple characters, all of whom are slightly insane. He did that terrifically in Silver Linings Playbook, and perhaps best of all in American Hustle. You're reminded of movies like Nashville and Magnolia when you see David O. Russell developing and expanding so many interesting, oddball characters into one movie revolving around one theme. But it doesn't work here. It's sad actually. The characters around Joy sure are crazy, but they don't serve any purpose, and they are sorely underdeveloped. The story is narrated by Joy's grandmother, who is the only other powerful woman in the movie, and Joy's inspiration in life. This sounds like a great character, but the problem is, we aren't told much about her. We have Joy's Mother, played by Virginia Madsen, who does nothing through movie but lay in her bed and watch soap operas. We actually get to see the soap opera she watches throughout the movie.. and I wish we didn't, because it added absolutely nothing to story. Robert De Niro plays Joy's father, who's basically an obnoxious playboy.. and that's about it.. poor De Niro, remember when he was good in movies? Edgar Ramirez plays Joy's ex-husband, who lives in her basement, making money as Joy's business associate and as failed lounge singer.. OK then. Worst of all is a largely thankless role by Bradley Cooper as the TV executive at QVC. Talk about a waste. Bradley Cooper, who in the last five years has given some incredible performances, is relegated to a walk-on role, with nothing to do but flirt with J Law again, as he always does, because audiences seem to like that.I seem to be criticizing the movie an awful lot, but it doesn't mean that I disliked it. I'm just slightly disappointed that David O. Russell didn't try harder to make this as good as the last two movies he's made. Maybe it wasn't meant to be in the first place. But I still liked this movie. Why after all that do I still like this movie? Two words, Jennifer Lawrence. She's mesmerizing, she's beautiful, she's the actress of our time. She's amazing as Joy Mangano. She made me genuinely feel some very strong feelings about the woman who made the Miracle Mop. I was not expecting that. J Law, whatever you are doing, never stop. Keep going.As a story about women in general, Joy comes up very short. As a film about one in particular, I did have fun watching it.",5,2,6,28 December 2015
Her," You've Got Mail
","Boy meets OS. A digitized love story, far ahead of it's time in what's increasingly looking like our future (for better or worse). Her is an exceptional idea for a film that presents it's thesis in fascinating and inventive ways. Scarlett Johansson's best performance might be this one, as Samantha. An unseen performance, conveying every proper human emotion flawlessly. This should have garnered her a Best Supporting Actress nomination, at the very least. Imagine the challenge of visually articulating a virtual relationship. My hat goes off to Spike Jonze. But what to make of Joaquin? Slowly getting into his element pre-Joker. He's fine, but I wasn't always on board with his personality as the timid Theodore Twomley. He's a flat line of emotion. Always unsure of himself and wishy-washy. We get glimpses of confidence, but throughout, he remains and one-note, uninteresting character. Samantha carries this thing. I know, pulling off this kind of character dynamic is incredibly difficult.",7,0,1,25 December 2019
The Nice Guys," Nobody is too old for this s***
","The Nice Guys is genius. It's Lethal Weapon meets The Big Lebowski. In ten years time, this film will be just as quotable as those films. This is a buddy-cop movie in prime form. Gosling and Crowe, it goes without saying, have the best chemistry a film director could ever ask for. The screenplay is so well written. The mystery really takes you for a ride. The jokes all land solidly. By far it's biggest strength is the work put into it as a period piece. It looks amazing. Not even American Hustle replicated the 70's as seamlessly as this. Every last detail and fabric is perfect. I look forward to seeing it again, and again.. and maybe again after that.",8,7,15,22 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Desmond Doss: American Hero
","Hacksaw Ridge is Mel Gibson's comeback film. After half of a decade of banishment from Hollywood following a string of leaked audio tapes revealing Gibson to use violent, racist and anti- semitic language, it appears that he has been absolved of his sins by the Hollywood elite, and has been given one more shot at success. He comes back to silver screen as a director, with a film many have placed into the category of conservative-freindy films. Films like American Sniper, 13 Hours and Patriots Day, that play extremely well with audiences across America and provide soaring box-office returns, but are scoffed at by films critics as being cliché, jingoist, patriarchal.. you name the buzz word. But perhaps Hacksaw Ridge finally bridges the gap between the film snobs, and the filmgoers. No, Hacksaw Ridge is not a movie only a Trump supporter would love. It tells a heartbreaking, inspiring story of courage, faith and unwavering love for humanity.Desmond Doss is a man many Americans strive to be, and quite frankly, fail. He's a man of deep faith, who enlists in the army to fight the Japanese in WWII. He would be the ideal marine, except for one thing.. he refused to pick up a gun. Desmond is the ultimate pacifist. His religion teaches him never to kill, even on the battlefield. To the chagrin of his division, he is demoted as a combat medic.The story unravels slowly, as we see Desmond in times before the war romancing a young southern belle played by the stunning Teresa Palmer. As well as his problems at home with his alcoholic, WWI vet father, provided by a tremendous performance by Hugo Weaving. Comedian Vince Vaughn appears as the drill sergeant, who brings his quick wit to this drama, and does a fabulous job. The sweet moments of the film's beginning seem sort of cheesy. But then, Desmond leaves for the war and with an anaconda grip, you are sucked into his hell on earth.We are taken to Okinawa, and the carnage begins. Hacksaw Ridge is by far the most violent film of the year. It's a war film that is unafraid of showing all of the blood and guts. You'll be taken completely aback as it begins. Heads get split open, torsos get cut in half, legs are blown apart. The nastiest aspects on this horrible war are on full display, but perhaps more disturbing of all, is the shell shocked Desmond, who fights with all of his might to do his job, and save his fellow men. One by one, he fills them with morphine and takes them back to the base. 'Lord, give me one more' he chants to himself. Desmond Doss is an unmistakable American hero. This is a moving picture. I hope that people can still be moved by a picture like this, but in this divisive climate, it is hard to say if that is even possible. As of this moment, we have never been farther apart, and we have never been more cynical as a country. But what we know far too well, is that we must honor the brave men that came before us that died protecting us. We enjoy our lives on the graves of men like Desmond Doss, who risked his life and his dignity saving us from the evils of fascism. His story is one that we desperately needed to hear from.",7,2,8,21 January 2017
The Social Network," Friend Zone
","2 unbelievably spellbinding hours. The Social Network is one of the best films of the 2010's. A film emblematic of the cold, cutthroat word of tech as we know it. Unlike most biopics about influential people, The Social Network does not portray Mark Zuckerberg as inspiring. You could call him an antihero, but that would suggest that the audience likes him enough to sympathize with him. Zuckerberg is a villain. A villain that won. The Social Network tells a story of injustice, with enough self-awareness to know that despite the damning details, it won't matter a wit. Zuckerberg created Facebook and there's not a thing anyone can do about it. In that sense, there's an irony to the story. It's a film about a social network built on the premise of friendship, that was forged in a avalanche of broken friendships. If that weren't enough, Zuckerberg is seen here as an obnoxious sociopath. The opposite of anyone to be friends with. David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin were a match made in heaven. It's Sorkin's most biting and cynical written work, paired with the green, gloomy visual realm that only Fincher is known for. Jesse Eisenberg is Zuckerberg, and it's the role of his career. I don't know what it says about him that he can play this character so well. One would hope he's nicer than this in person.",10,1,2,15 April 2020
The Fighter," K-O
","Remember David O. Russell? The emotionally volatile film director turned Hollywood wonder-boy who had a string of back to back Oscar nominated films in the early part of the decade. Touted by many as the next Scorsese, Russell's films cast a spell on the filmgoing public. Perhaps some of that was all apart of a ruse. Silver Lining's Playbook is a good adaptation of a great novel, but too forgettable to be a masterpiece and too corny to be as heart-wrenching as it wanted to be. In 2013, I was smitten by American Hustle, which rattled my brain for what I thought was a GoodFellas of the new millennium. What I now realize is how manipulative and stylistic of an experiment that movie was. You might as well have sold it in can titled 'I Can't Believe it's Not Scorsese!'. This all culminated in Joy, a self important mess of a film. The spell was broken. By that point, David O. Russell was reduced to a man of plastic realities, and nobody ever heard from him again. So, as I sat down to watch The Fighter, I noticed something. Truthfully, this is the best film that David O. Russell has ever made. One that made him a top-tier filmmaker to watch. Ironically, this is his least plastic, stylistic and frilly movie of his catalogue. His brilliant gifts as a filmmaker come alive and in full color when he just tells a real story, with real characters. That's what The Fighter is.It's the story of Micky and Dicky Ward. Dick is 'the pride of Lowell', or he was, until he got hooked on crack. Long gone is his heyday of beating Sugar Ray in the ring. He's just another Mass townie. His brother Micky looks up to him, for it's his turn to re-fill the shoes that Dicky left behind. Micky wants to break out all on his own. He wants to be a champ. But he's stuck living in Dicky's shadow, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that Dicky is a human train-wreck who constantly needs bailing out. If that weren't enough, Micky's mother is his own manager, and his endless army of sisters fight for his attention. Micky is drowning in family. This affects his ability to fight. But what keeps Micky going is a beautiful bartender named Charlene, who's the only one that makes him feel like someone.David O. Russell clearly knows what makes boxing movies work. He's clearly seen Raging Bull. The man behind the glove is what really powers the punch. In Micky's case, every day is a knockout. Russell focuses like a laser on these characters. Places them in depth and fully establishes their motivations. Moreover, these are real people. Nobody overacts here. There's simply no need. It's a tour-de-force in that sense. Do I even need to mention Christian Bale? This is his best on-screen role by a mile. It's interesting how this film even includes the HBO crew that was filming the life and times of Micky and Dicky during the course of this story. In a way, it's almost as if that crew left the cameras on and we are getting to see the raw footage of what they got. It's that genuine of a product. That's more than anyone has ever said about David O. Russell's other films, and maybe that was what has been missing all along.",9,0,0,26 October 2019
