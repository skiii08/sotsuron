Blade Runner 2049," Contradiction
","Blade Runner was an exciting, introguing and actionpacked film yet made me think.This is just a slow-mo contradictoryf ilm that has a police force hunt down peaceful inhabitants and makes the replicants 'alive' and yet the old rules seemingly apply. The people who made this are lost.
