Gremlins," Best Movie...Ever
","After seeing alot of summer movies frolick around in the grass, I felt I needed to go back to a classic...yes, thats right, Gremlins. Gremlins not only holds a place in my movie going heart, but also my mind races with ideas of plot lines that made this movie a subplot to a subplot. Also, the special effects were stupendus and way beyond it's time. Those tiny little Gremlins running around, terrorizing the small town just makes me tingle...deep down inside. Quite the Indie-Classic. A+, my friends A+",10,2,5,17 May 2003
