Raiders of the Lost Ark," Harrison Ford reaches stardom
","'From the creators of Jaws and Star Wars': Reading that, the audience could expect the best on screen, and the fact is that they got it.Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of numerous Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. Spielberg proved with that movie his capacity to combine critical and public success. This first chapter of the Indiana Jones trilogy has become a classic. It is one of the rare pictures that give you intense pleasure. The two stars of the movie are certainly the hero, incarnated by Harrison Ford, and the action sequences. Harrison Ford gives his most famous performance. First reveled by Star Wars, he undoubtedly becomes a star with that role.The movie is an incredible succession of stunts, an extraordinary ride that captures our imagination. It is a movie very comparable to Star Wars and its sequels, a magical film. Like in Star Wars, music plays a major role. John Williams's march is one of his most famous works. And the movie is one of the marks that Steven Spielberg will let on the Earth, as a top filmmaker in cinema history.",10,0,1,12 June 1999
Aliens," A 'tour de force'
","Sequels are rarely as successful as originals. Exceptions: Star Wars, Indiana Jones or Alien. Alien was a terrific movie, it marked a new way of making sci-fi movies. It mixed horror and science fiction perfectly well. The sequel to Alien, Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is a great achievement too. Aliens is one of the top action films ever made. It shows how brilliant director James Cameron is, a long time before Titanic. The original Alien was particularly suspenseful. I believe the sequel has other qualities. It is terrific also. But Aliens is above all a wonderfully well-made movie, with great rhythm and non-stop action that is really impressive. Along with spectacular scenes is Sigourney Weaver, really wonderful in the part that made her famous. James Cameron wrote a beautiful part for her, and she finally gave a memorable performance, proving that women can play tough parts. In Aliens, I also liked the performance by Lance Henriksen, a good actor who has often had supporting roles. Here, he acts the android Bishop perfectly well. Aliens, the second installment in the Alien saga, is my favourite and I strongly recommend it to everyone who want to have more than two hours of great entertainment.",9,0,1,12 June 1999
The Matrix," Highly recommendable science fiction movie
","I just saw the film two weeks ago, and I must agree that it is a major film, that deserves all the good critics I have read. What are the qualities of The Matrix ?The subject itself is interesting and the directors managed to make the story both complex and captivating. I think that this film really shows what science fiction can be at its best.And of course, the film is highly spectacular. The action sequences are very well-made, and there is an excellent use of the special effects, as they really serve the script, making us enter an incredible but finally believable world.In brief, thanks to the Wachowski Brothers for this clever action flick. I would give the film between 8 and 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,10 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The ultimate entertainment
","Like millions of people in the world, the Star Wars saga has filled me with great pleasure. George Lucas really managed to create a modern mythology. This story is eternal. I believe that the second chapter of the trilogy is the best film of the three. The Empire Strikes Back takes you and brings you far away, in a fantastic world, through a captivating adventure. What makes this film a masterpiece ? It is pure delight. The duel between Luke and Vader is memorable, it contains wonderful moments, particularly the one when Darth Vader tells Luke he is his father. The movie also introduces new characters, notably Yoda, the unforgettable Jedi master. The action sequences are really enjoyable. This movie is a summary of all the Star Wars magic. George Lucas has given the term 'entertainment' a noble dimension. The force will be with him. Always...",10,0,0,12 June 1999
