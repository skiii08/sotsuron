Insidious: Chapter 2," Better than the first - developed story, developed scares!
","I just came back from the late night launch and my throat is killing me from screaming. I went into the film 50/50 because I loved the 1st one and read that this one had a better story but lacked the scares. Well, I agree that the story is more developed and a lot better, along with explaining some events from the 1st film. The scares were jacked up too IMO. Tucker and Specs returned as the comic relief of the film and did a good job in doing so, albeit there were 1-2 moments that didn't involve them that were unintentionally funny, but that didn't spoil the film. I am really pleased with the acting and creepiness of the storyline, which developed the story and characters and just made it better than the first, along with leaving an opening for a 3rd film.Creepier, jumpier, scarier, better. 4/5",10,2,4,13 September 2013
