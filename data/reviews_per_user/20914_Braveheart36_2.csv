The New World," Beautiful sweeping movie
","Like watching a poem, it's poetic, artful and as stunning as a moving painting. Terrance Malick's films are an acquired taste. There is very little dialogue but the film doesn't need it, it's story is told through expressions, music and cinematography. Each word is meant to be meaningful and not wasted.The settings are authentic and real, you feel as if you are transported to the 17th century. It makes you appreciate the trials the early settlers had to go through. The New World is not my favorite movie of all time, but I have an appreciation for the way Malick brings this movie to life. It makes you think and feel each frame of the film is given much thought",7,0,1,8 May 2011
Braveheart," A story of love for a women and ones country
","If ever the was a story of love and devotion to ones beliefs this is it. The character of William Wallace in my mind is one of the greats of all time. Everytime I watch Braveheart it stirs up emotions in me each time I see it. The story of the Scots and there battle is truly a David and Goliath. If you ever watch this movie, take note of each character and their expressions and how much a stare or a look can mean so much. Mel Gibson has my total admiration on the job he did with Braveheart, it's my all time favorite movie, and I can watch it over and over. It's a must see and one of the all time greats.",10,2,3,3 September 1999
