It," Horror for kids
","I had such big expectations and it turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. There was not one even one moment or scary scene - it felt like it was a horror movie for children. Massive CGI that turns out to be ridiculous instead of scary - no suspense or tense moments at all. Some funny moments held by the cast but that's not what you want to get from a scary movie - as someone said, this movie had a really smart marketing campaign!!",1,2,4,12 October 2017
