Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Positively Entertaining Beyond Belief
","Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the top journalist from Kazakhstan's very own television network. His latest assignment requires him to travel to the United States. While there he must learn about American culture and what makes it so 'great'. Along the way he encounters people from almost every walk of life, all the while shocking and amazing those very same people simultaneously.First off, I must warn you that 'Borat:' is not for everyone. If you can't take a joke or completely have no sense of humor, stop reading this review right now. Please then proceed to kill yourself. Okay, don't actually commit suicide, but at least hurt yourself in some way.Now, having said that, it must be known that 'Borat:' is hands down, without a doubt, no matter what, the funniest film of the year. Prior to seeing it I knew it would be hilarious. I figured though that once settled in and it ran for a little while the jokes would become annoying. Then of course there'd be a few cases here and there that were laugh-out-loud funny, but nothing major. How wrong I was. Wrong indeed. From beginning to end its outrageously hysterical. Each time you think it couldn't get any better, it proves you wrong over and over. Cohen deserves much praise for being able to keep a straight face through each scene.Despite being positively entertaining beyond belief though, there will still be those who insist on disagreeing. It's true, a lot of people probably will be offended by some of the things shown in 'Borat:', but don't let them deter you from seeing it. They're simply too busy trying to get the three foot stick they have up lodged up their ass out, that they can't possibly see its humor. My friend Clay put it best yesterday when he said, 'I think its too smart for Americans'. For the most part, that's correct. The irony presented won't be noticed by hardly any American because they'll be too busy laughing themselves to death over how they think Borat 'doesn't get it'. I'm not trying to say everyone in America that sees it is a dumb-ass either, but that's just the truth.Well I guess its about time I wrapped this review up. Indeed it was short, but really, there's only three things you need to know about 'Borat:'. One, it's side-splitting, two, it's brilliant, and finally three, Jews can't really turn transform themselves into cockroaches. Or can they?",10,1,12,1 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," All Hype, No Substance
","Back in the company of Captain Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp) we are again taken on an escapade of the melancholy and mischievous sort. This time Jack is on a search for the Dead Man's Chest. For once he possesses it he will be able to control the one who he owes a debt to. The ruler of the sea, Davy Jones. (Bill Nighy) But what would this quest be without the assistance of his fellow chum Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann? (Keira Knightly) They too are inevitably drug into this whirlwind of non-stop 'comedy' and various mishaps. All the while is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) also yearning to get the chest as well so he can single-handedly rid the seas of pirates everywhere.Usually sequels don't surpass the greatness and originality their predecessors establish. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' doesn't fail to follow suit. From the trailers it appears to be an exciting thrill ride loaded with tons of merriment. But in reality its a two hour and thirty five minute foreseeable film filled with humdrum antics and sleep inducing banter.The first 'Pirates' was absolutely one hundred percent far more delightful. Before it, a character with humor and essence such as Captain Jack Sparrow hadn't been seen in cinema. A once amusing and engaging Jack is now just plain annoying. Here in 'Dead Man's Chest' his foolhardy, joker demeanor only halts the story as it attempts to progress. In addition, average acting and direction are dishearteningly unveiled. The only pleasing aspects presented are the outstanding visuals and devilishly good villain Davy Jones. I'm afraid neither of these ingredients are able to save this mess of a film from sinking though.The bottom line is, 'Dead Man's Chest' is nothing more than a film built on hype and in the end has no real substance. 'I think the second movie is strong and clever and has a lot going on', said director Gore Verbinski in an October interview last year when speaking about 'Pirates'. Apparently this version of the film didn't make the final cut. Even so, 'Dead Man's Chest' will without a doubt continue to dominate at the movies and make other summer releases walk the plank at the box office. I don't think even Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx's big screen adaptation of 'Miami Vice' will be able to decimate it when released this Friday. I guess I can give Verbinski some credit though. It's pretty amazing to see a film with video-game logic that's created from zip do so tremendous.",5,4,7,1 February 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Film-making at Its Best
","Of all the films released in 2006, none is more intriguing than Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Illustrating a refined tale wrapped in drama, filled with fantasy, & sprinkled with just a hint of horror, it proves to be film-making at its best.Set in the year 1944 during postwar regression in Spain, 'Pan's Labyrinth' centers around a young girl named Ofelia. In order to escape her daunting and misery-filled everyday life, she creates a fictitious world containing diverse creatures and total wonderment. It's in this place she must follow the path she herself paves that will free her from the troubles of the real world.It's not very often we see a film such as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. It combines the innocence of 'Alice in Wonderland' with the essence of 'Donnie Darko'. The end result is a fairytale simple enough for children to grasp, yet riveting enough for adults to thoroughly enjoy. Not once during it did I come to find myself weary or uninterested. The story told here tickles the mind with its genuinely captivating aura almost to the point of mesmerism.Although the fantastic imagery and guidance from del Toro aid in its greatness, the biggest disappointment 'Pan's Labyrinth' bears is one it shares with many of this years other films. Once again the acting comes up short. Most notably with Maribel Verdu who plays Mercedes, the woman who tries to shelter and protect Ofelia. It's obvious she's trying her hardest, but unfortunately she just isn't able to deliver a sincere and overall convincing performance. However, this setback barely, if at all, takes away appeal from this stunning film.I must warn parents though, this isn't a film I would recommend taking the kids to see. Yes, it is indeed a fairytale, but it's not suited for children. It is after all rated R for a reason, that being for violence and a bit of language. I do though highly recommend it to any adult looking for an original and worthwhile film. So go ahead and enter Pan's Labyrinth. You'll be glad you did.",9,2,5,1 February 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," An Absolute Winner
","Olive (Abigail Breslin), Richard (Greg Kinnear), Sheryl (Toni Collette), Dwayne (Paul Dano), Frank (Steve Carell), & someone simply known as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) all make up the Hoover family. Together they are traveling in a run-down yellow VW bus from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach in order to get 7-year-old Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, where she will hopefully be crowned the winner. As simple a task that may seem, the trip proves to be a difficult, yet enriching one. On their journey the family must deal with heartbreak, shattered dreams, & even death, all the while learning to support and trust one another no matter what life throws their way.First time directors, Faris and Dayton, have created a remarkably and genuinely excellent film. From the amazing cast and their splendid performances to the hilarious screenplay written by Michael Arndt, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is hands down one best films of the year.The great thing about each character that is apart of the Hoover family and featured in the movie, is that they're all so very realistic. The most distinctive and memorable members of the family would have to be Olive's older brother, Dwayne and Grandpa. Dwayne presents the characteristics of what many kids today consider themselves today as 'emo'. As the film advances, we learn he is actually just your average teenager that's simply misunderstood and not 'emo' at all. Then there's Grandpa; wisecracking, heroin snorting, kicked out of the retirement home for sleeping around Grandpa. Arkin does a terrific job with this role. He brings not only the character's written personality to life, but adds his own flare as well with his great facial expressions that only fuels the entertaining hoopla presented in 'Little Miss Sunshine'.The hilarity doesn't seem to stop even when death tries to darken the movie's comedic stance. Grandpa's rantings alone make the movie worth seeing. The irony that Olive's dad, Richard, is a motivational speaker who day in, day out informs people about how to achieve their goals, yet he himself can't accomplish anything is just of the several added bonuses.After changing my mind three times; first deciding to see 'The Illusionist', then again to 'The Black Dahlia', and finally agreeing upon 'Little Miss Sunshine' I'm really glad I did. There's not a funnier or better cast film out right now. The bottom line is 'Little Miss Sunshine' is an absolute winner and one of the few must-see films of the year. The only reason not to see it would be because it's no longer playing at your theater. In which case you then find another theater in your area that is.",9,2,4,1 February 2007
Over the Hedge," Go on, Take a Peek
","Who would've thought Bruce Willis would be playing a troubled NYPD officer and a mischievous raccoon both in the same year? Well he has, and done both quite well. Bruce Willis, along with Eugene Levy, Nick Nolte, Wanda Sykes, & many others appear in the all-new Dreamworks animation, 'Over the Hedge'. Which is brought to us by the director of 1998's 'Antz', Tim Johnson, and the producer of last year's hit 'Madagascar' and the writer of the upcoming 'Charlotte's Web', Karey Kirkpatrick.In 'Over the Hedge' we are taken into what is left of some woodland creature's home, now invaded by suburban life and surrounded by an encompassing hedge. They now have a dilemma. Where are they going to find food? That's where Bruce Willis' character, RJ the raccoon comes in. He explains to them on the other side of the hedge that there are plenty of delicious varieties of food. Including Hammy the squirrel's (Steve Carell) new favorite, nacho cheese flavored chips. While Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling) is skeptical and warns the others that it isn't safe over the hedge they all go along with RJ anyways in hopes of retrieving tasty treats. What they are unaware of is that RJ only wants to gather food for a hungry bear (Nick Nolte) so he himself doesn't get killed.'Over the Hedge' is nowhere near other animated films like 'Shrek' and 'Toy Story' in terms of greatness. It lacks a certain quality that is inexplicable. But its still highly enjoyable. The animation itself is very good, there's lots of funny moments for both children and adults to enjoy, and the story is good. (Although there are a few flaws in it, but nothing major.) The good thing is 'Over the Hedge' isn't being made out to be what those other films were. From being based on a comic strip it sure turned out to be pretty good. If you haven't seen it already, I suggest you take some time and go see what's over the hedge. You might just see something you like.",8,0,1,1 February 2007
Saw III," Let the Games Begin
","Lately Dr. Lynn Denoln (Bahar Soomekh) has been going through some marital problems and the anxiety is beginning to affect her work. Late one night after finishing her shift at the hospital she is kidnapped and taken to an abandoned warehouse. Shortly after waking up, she soon meets the notorious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). He is currently dying slowly as the minutes pass and Amanda (Shawnne Smith), Jigsaw's sidekick, tells Lynn she has been kidnapped in order to keep him alive. Alive long enough for someone else that's also been kidnapped named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), to complete his very own game. While telling Lynn this, Amanda places a collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to Jigsaw's heart rate. If his heart rate drops below zero before Jeff completes his game, the shotgun shells on the collar will all simultaneously go off at the same time. Amanda then preps Lynn as Jigsaw explains, 'it's a test of will. It's a test to see just how willing you are to keep someone alive'. Lynn realizes she has no choice, and so the game begins. Jeff must now navigate through a series of tasks where he is promised his chance to get revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. Something he has wanted every day for the last three years. Both Lynn and Jeff are now each tangled in a horrid game of survival. What they don't know is their games are merely stepping stones to the true reason they are involved with Jigsaw's latest puzzle.First off, I have to admit I was a little turned off to 'Saw III' earlier this week after months of having much anticipation, when I heard it was guaranteed that there would be a 'Saw 4' if 'III' did well opening weekend. I feared then, and still do slightly, that the 'Saw' franchise will become what 'Friday the 13th' did: a series of films where only the first few were considered good. Once I was sitting in my seat at the theater though, and the film began I was vastly interested far more than I imagined I would be. This 'Saw' has so much story in it than the previous two had, and really more than most horror films today do. Much of it is told generally with various flashbacks. Even by following the story closely, the final twist probably won't be known to you until its unveiling. It's in the twist that a tiny smidgen of a problem exists.It's obvious that the twist was meant to shock the audience in a big way. Maybe it does catch most people by surprise, but for me didn't. Not that it isn't good, it just didn't come across the way it should have. It gave me a, oh...okay feeling rather than a, holy sh*t reaction. This minor flaw doesn't hinder the film's poise at all though. It still remains interesting to the very last minute.The only real letdown in the film are some of the traps. In all there is a total of six physical ones. These devices of torture and terror are what many of people who love the 'Saw' series look forward to most. Out of the six, only two were what I'd say good. Yes, all of them can kill, but four of them seemed boring and livid. I'm not sure what happened here. Although, this doesn't destroy the movie, in a small way it does take away from it. Even so, the two good traps almost make up for the others.So basically, 'Saw III' is somewhat better than I expected. It borders very closely to the feel of the first, which is a definite plus. Most satisfying though is that it wasn't the least bit dismal. Never was there a dull moment, even with the few shoddy traps. Now that 'Saw III' is done and over with though, it only makes me question what '4' have in store for us. Yes, Tobin Bell was contracted for five films permitting each is considered a success, but now that director Bousman and writer Whannell have decided to step aside and leave the series alone, I can only wonder two things. Will 'Saw' become a victim of its own game? Just how long can the series go on before it suffers the fate Jason Voorhees did?",7,0,1,1 February 2007
Cars," Sit Back and Enjoy the Ride
","What do Richard Petty, Owen Wilson, & Paul Newman have in common? They're all in Walt Disney and Pixar's latest film 'Cars'. The story revolves around a rookie race car learning that life isn't about where you're going, but how you get there. Now I'll admit, last fall when I first heard about this movie I completely wrote it off as being utterly preposterous. Why? Simply because the idea of talking cars didn't seem entertaining in the least. It actually wasn't until the day before its release I said, wow, I think Disney's got something here. (Which only proved to be true after seeing it the next day.) John Lassester, the man who took us into the world of toys in 'Toy Story' and on a search for a young clown fish in 'Finding Nemo' has done it once again. First off, there's Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson) funny and irresistibly lovable new best friend, Mater. (Larry the Cable Guy) He adds to 'Cars' what Scrat the squirrel does in the 'Ice Age' films. Now don't get me wrong, many of the other characters featured in the film are plenty likable, but Mater is the glue that brings it all together. Also in 'Cars' the animation is superb. It doesn't have the same style or look the other Pixar films have. I don't really know how to describe it, but it's certainly something.But, as almost all movies, 'Cars' does have a drawback. It's missing something. That special something only Disney and Pixar can add that made 'Toy Story' what it is, a great movie. I'm not sure why, but it's just not there. I imagine in the end 'Cars' will just fall short of having the longevity and memorability films like 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters, Inc.' & 'Toy Story' will. Despite this, 'Cars' is still a winner and manages to be excellent. Not a classic, but excellent. I highly recommend seeing it at least once to give it a test drive.",9,0,0,1 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Never Catches Fire
","The trailers have finished and the lights are dimming completely now. That familiar torch lady in the Columbia Pictures logo has appeared and quickly vanishes into the Marvel Comics flipping logo which transforms into a Ghost Rider inspired font. Finally the Crystal Sky logo is shown, then it comes; a somewhat interesting, but not quite exciting narration by Sam Elliott, who here plays the Caretaker. After we are told the 'backstory' the high energy, fire decorated opening credits begin. It's here I think to myself, come on Johnson, impress me. About an hour and fifty minutes later I accept the fact that I asked for too much. Don't get me wrong, there's lot of sparks, most being the visuals, but the fire never really gets going in 'Ghost Rider'.The storyline here really isn't all that complex. When Johnny Blaze, first played Matthew Long, was a teen he made a deal with the Devil, better known here as Mephistopheles, played by Peter Fonda. This deal was to save his 'father' from the cancer that was slowly killing him. Mephisto keeps to the deal, but Johnny's 'father' dies later that same day during a motorcycle stunt. In exchange for his 'father's' health, even though short-lived, Johnny will one day be called upon to become the Ghost Rider and do Mephisto's bidding. Years later, Johnny, now played by Nicolas Cage, is a famous stunt driver and is haunted by the deal he made every day of his life. The time comes and he is revisited by Mephiso and told to seek out and destroy Blackheart, played by Wes Bently, who has his own team of thugs known as the Nephilim. Once he does, Johnny is promised his soul will be returned, thus ridding him of the curse he currently bears.So there you have it, the basic outline for 'Ghost Rider'. That is where the film first starts to fall apart. The real story of Johnny Blaze's life and how he becomes Ghost Rider is slightly different. Crash is not Johnny's actual father as we are led to believe. (That's why I put quotations around father in the above description.) His wife Mona isn't even in the film and Mephisto is never driven away by Roxanne's purity either here. These among other things are some of the ways Mark Steven Johnson's take on 'Ghost Rider' isn't true to the comic. I myself aren't a Ghost Rider fanatic or anything close, but I'm sure those that are will find these alterations unnecessary and questionable. For the rest of the public that are unaware though, they'll just take it as is as they're force fed Johnson's $120 million adaptation.Oh, but that's not all that's bad folks. Acting skill was apparently not a priority. If it were, I believe someone else would have been cast in the role of Roxanne, played by Eva Mendes. I'm. Not. Going. Anywhere. Digging deep, that's how Mendes' lines come out. It. Was. Almost. Robotic. The. Way. She. Spoke. Bently is not very good either. He's just doesn't come off villainous enough. He's got the look I guess, but that's about it. It's not entirely the actor's fault's though. The combined effort of Johnson, Shane Salerno, David S. Goyer, & Jonathan Hensleigh that's called a screenplay is far from good writing. A couple weeks back and again this week I was warned that the comics weren't written too well either. Let me just say to that person now, Nick, if they're anything like the dialogue in the film, you were dead on. Too much comedy was added in as well. Continuously jokes are spread throughout, which takes away from the sense of seriousness and drama that I believe was crucial for everything to work.The visuals are what in the end strive to be the focal point of the film. The fire doesn't always appear to be real, but everything is just plain cool looking. The most memorable moment for me was when the water element member of the Nemphilim's eye drips down his face and he wipes it off while instantaneously another eye appears. That was pretty awesome. I can't forget about the bike though, it's beautiful. As a whole though, the pricey CGI isn't enough to compensate for all the mistakes. 'Ghost Rider' makes it clear that Johnson should leave comic characters alone. He obviously can't do it right, so why even attempt?",3,2,6,17 February 2007
Black Snake Moan," Bold Bite
","If you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then, you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously, there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it.In the third offering from director Craig Brewer, we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims, everything is hotter. While there we're introduced to the Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson, and the almost always half naked Rae; a role bravely taken on by Christina Ricci. In the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we'd be a lot better off. The question of if this will be understood, or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here. You'd think with the role of a sex-crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is. Sadly, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake who plays Rae's military-bound boyfriend isn't all that great. At the start, he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard. Later on he steps it up some, still he's far from the level he reached in January's 'Alpha Dog'.The other thing 'Black Snake Moan' boasts is a splendid soundtrack. Containing tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces from the score done by Scott Bomar, & of course four, count 'em, four tracks from Jackson himself. It's actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film, 'Stackolee' that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomar's 'The Chain', 'When the Lights Go Out' from the Black Keys, & the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night.The efforts of Craig Brewer can't go without mention though. His last film 'Hustle & Flow' which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. What he has done with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry. He not only directed 'Moan', but also wrote its screenplay. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. As you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its valiant composure. Just as you think you've predicted the next move Brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route. There are however some blotches within the screenplay. The background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing. It left me craving for something more exciting. After so many highs I guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film.I imagine the majority of people who see 'Black Snake Moan' won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely, even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received. It's the issues of race, religious motives, & sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything. The idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. Simply put, it's not for everyone. Like I said, to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind, or else you're just wasting your money. For those of you who can do that, I highly recommend it.",8,117,144,3 March 2007
300," Bloody Eyecandy That's Sometimes Sweet
","Film adaptations whether they're TV, musical, novel, or in the case of '300', graphic novel are always risky. The director has to worry about what to keep from the original material, what to take out, & what to add in order to make the final product considered great. All those things are equally important and if even one is flawed, the others could be comprised no matter how good they may be. In second-time director Zack Snyder's big screen take on Frank Miller's 1998 graphic novel there are many visual effects, but really not much else. The odd thing is, that's actually a good thing. A very good thing.'300' tells the not-so-accurate account of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. Led by King Leonidas, here played by Gerard Butler, 300 Spartan warriors fought to death against King Xerxes' Persian army. As a result, the rest of Greece was inspired to band together against Xerxes, creating the world's first democracy. There you have it, pretty much the entire movie in a nutshell. The simplicity of the film's outline for the most part helps everything move along smoothly. Snyder added a few bits and pieces to Miller's original storyline in order help spice things up, but nothing too drastic. Only a couple of times does it seem like things are going in slow motion, but that's mainly because of the intense battle sequences which make some instances feel dull in comparison.Where as the last adaptation of a graphic novel, 'Sin City' was filled with notable names portraying the characters, in '300' there are slim to none. Mostly, none. Although Butler has starred in almost twenty films he's yet to reach that point where he's a household name. In '300' there is barely any room for acting between the arm slicing and head chopping scenes. Only a handful of the actors get a chance to do much with their roles. Lena Headley, who plays Queen Gorgo gets the most screen-time aside from Butler. She does okay I suppose. Nothing amazing, but not dreadful either. Acting isn't what is important in this film though. It's those fancy special effects.The ocean scene is magnificent, the scenery is amazing, but other things aren't always so impressive. In the first encounter with the Persians, the stylized blood makes the graphic novel feel truly present, which is great. After that scene though, the effect is no longer seen. The blood is normal, I guess you could say. The feel was present in quite a few other scenes, but since blood is a huge part of this film, I felt some of the quality was lost. Also, the creatures such as the elephants and rhino were a bit shoddy. They didn't appear life-like. However, much like the other special effects extravaganza this year, 'Ghost Rider' everything looks cool so it's not that big of a deal. For the record that's the only thing '300' and 'Ghost Rider' have in common. I just want to make that clear.Earlier this year I named '300' as one of the ten films to pay attention to. At the time, I thought it was going to be excellent. Now that I've seen it I can return to that presumption. I'm not going to lie, it did disappoint me. I expected something more. Don't get me wrong it's really good, just not great. I'm also not going to brush off the fact that that this film will still end up being a favorite of many. It has tremendous appeal and will gross well over $100 million at the box office in no time. Like I said, it's good that there are so many visuals effects and not much else. Had there been a lot of big names and the storyline been changed it wouldn't have been the same. The effects step up pleasing the audience and allow the actors (which most people won't even recognize) take the backseat for once. For me though, it just didn't have that oomph I hoped for.",8,1,4,10 March 2007
Click," Sandler Doesn't Click, Only Stumbles
","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is a workaholic architect who lately, has been putting his career before his family. While at a Bed Bath & Beyond one night shopping for a universal remote he meets a man by the name of Morty. (Christopher Walken) It's Morty that ends up changing Michael's life with the gift of a remote that not only controls the TV and other household appliances, but his own universe. Upon discovering the abilities the remote has Michael begins to use it to fast-forward through what he considers unpleasant and annoying. Such as fights with his wife and foreplay. As he does this the remote begins creating its own memory and eventually starts to automatically choose what to fast-forward through. Michael unremittingly goes further and further through his life as the remote continues to fast-forward. In turn, he realizes the importance of spending time with his family.'Click' seemingly starts out will with its cutesy family wisecracks. And the first couple instances where Michael uses the remote for his own personal kicks is somewhat funny. After that, there really are no laughs to be had. It's just the same joke exhibited over and over again with different alterations. Even the dog Sundance's incessant humping of a stuffed duck gets old real quick as the film advances. This is tragic because 'Click' is being passed off as a comedy but unmistakably isn't funny.Another fault the film bears is the main character Micheal is nowhere as entertaining as Morty. Not only did Walken do a better job of acting, he is overall more enjoyable to watch. Truth be told, Morty is actually the only thing that holds this mess together. And only slightly better than average direction by Frank Caraci who also did two of Sandler's other films ('The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer') only contributes dullness to this already colorless movie.There are however a few heartfelt moments displayed throughout the extent of the film. But in the final scenes there's supposed to be a big profound moment when Michael desperately tries to tell his son how family comes first with his last breaths but Sandler just doesn't deliver. Who honestly expected splendid acting from him though? But despite all the downsides 'Click' presents, many people will still enjoy it. What can I say, fart and sex jokes sell.",4,1,3,1 February 2007
Happy Feet," Entertaining Despite Its Flaws
","2006 has turned out to be the year for digital animation. From talking cars to suburban turned forest animals it seems like we've almost seen it allor so we thought. The fresh and upbeat penguin-filled musical 'Happy Feet' is the thirteenth digitally animated film to be released this year. And as expected, people are eating it up. Some have gone as far to say it's the year's best. There was better this year, but 'Happy Feet' is okay.In 'Happy Feet' we are given front row seats to the birth and growth of a penguin by the name of Mumble who is voiced by Elijah Wood. He's different from all the other penguins. In a world where finding your 'heartsong' is crucial, poor Mumble isn't able to keep a tune at all. Interestingly enough though, he can dance up a storm. Unfortunately this is frowned upon and ends up causing him great distress. Eventually the elder penguin Noah, who is voiced by Hugo Weaving, accuses Mumble of bringing on the famine that is currently afflicting the penguins. Mumble attempts to explain that he believes 'aliens' are the real cause. Noah doesn't take him seriously at all and banishes him, claiming that once he is gone, the famine will end. Mumbles then promises that he will return, and when he does he will bring proof that the alleged 'aliens' are to blame. He then embarks on his journey where along the way he makes some new friends and learns the world outside his own is much different than he could have ever thought possible.Visually, 'Happy Feet' is amazing. Almost every landscape down to the smallest icicle look so very real. Even the penguins themselves are highly detailed, but obviously aren't real. Aside from that and the direction from Greg Miller, everything presented in 'Happy Feet' is just okay. Nothing in it evokes a wholehearted wow. The plot itself takes what seems forever to be revealed. There's a forty five minute wait before anything about a famine is even mentioned. Watching the film is a lot like riding a roller coaster. No, I don't mean its a thrill ride. The way the story is set up, it goes up and down. Each time it begins to drag, something comes along to get it going again. And when the ending finally comes, it appears forced. The whole addition of an environmental issue still has me wondering. I guess because without it there would be nothing for Mumble to do on his journey of discovery.The main issue I have with 'Happy Feet' though revolves around the music. Yes, I know it's a musical, but the music seemed to really exceed the film itself. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. The reason being is because the film suggests that there actually is a real story behind it all. Either way, it doesn't really matter because it's the singing and dancing that will have people returning to see it all again. So despite having some assuredly bad qualities 'Happy Feet' does indeed have its moments. It does what it was supposed to, and that's entertain.",6,0,0,1 February 2007
