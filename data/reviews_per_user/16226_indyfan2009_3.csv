Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic in every way
","This is by far my favorite movie of all time. I have watched this movie over and over and over again and it never gets old. Every scene is beautiful and awesome. This is the most classic movie ever. Every scene is memorable for some reason or another. Whether it be the fist fight by the plane, the truck chase, the snake pit, the opening adventure, or the infamous face melting, every one is amazing. This is the movie, that from the ages of 10-14, made me want to be an archaeologist, and now, as a young man, it makes me want to be a film maker. It is a perfect movie in every way, and can never be recreated. Thank you Steven Spielberg, and thank you George Lucas, and thank you Harrison Ford, for creating my favorite movie of all time.",10,2,4,24 May 2008
The Departed," Fan-frickin-tastic
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is the only movie I'll ever give a 10 to, but this movie is as close as you can get to that. I love this movie. This is one of the most engrossing films I have ever seen. The writing, cinematography, direction, and acting are all awesome. It is an intense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending is of this movie is beyond words. Blew me away. Damon is in my favorite role of his next to Jason Bourne. Jack is great. And even Dicaprio, who I am not a fan of, is pretty good. Marky-Mark of course is funny and great in his part. Martin Scorsese is a fenominal director and made this movie amazing. I love this flick. Kudos to Scorsese. He can make mob stories like no one else.",9,2,3,24 May 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Almost as good as the first
","This movie does it. It brings back the feel of Raiders and adds more to it. Granted, it can never top the original Jones, but i comes very very close. To me, this and the first movie blow Temple of Doom and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull clean out of the water. Every Indy movie is entertaining to me, but this and the first are the only ones I can watch over and over again. Sean Connery is hilarious as Henry Jones Sr, and of course Harrison Ford is perfect as the unstoppable Indiana Jones. The opening sequence is perfect, giving the viewer a glimpse into the past of Indy and showing him/her how some things started. (the whip, hat, and fear of snakes) Over all, this movie comes as close to Raiders and Spielberg and Lucas will probably ever get. But who knows, hopefully they can make up for Crystal Skull with something a little more Indiana Jones-ish. Come on Indy 5, don't let us down.",9,0,1,24 May 2008
