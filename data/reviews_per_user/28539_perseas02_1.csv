Insidious: Chapter 2," Insult 2
","What can I say. I am not a huge fan of horror flicks but I do admire James Wan. Well, Insidious 2 is not horror at all after all. I saw it yesterday and I must say I was embarrassed in front of my husband as I was insisting to see it. The plot very basic, like a repeat of Chapter 1. Josh not compelling at all and Rose Byrns had a wooden constant scared/dull expression on her face throughout the entire film. The shifts back and forth in time were totally confusing and clumsily done. The effects were utterly cheap (I hated that steam-effect....how cheesy like an 80s disco)and the Gothic, powdered face smokey eyed ghosts were a joke. Also this movie was stupid. If the ghost was attacking the baby WHY WAS THAT IDIOT MOTHER LEAVING IT ALONE ALL THE TIME???? Oh, and those two geeks (the snowboarder throwback and the nerd)what were they all about? They were scared shitless so why were they doing that job?? And those silly comic relief bits were out of place and useless...Unfortunaltely Insult 3 is in the works....James, you can do so much better!!!!",4,4,7,13 December 2013
