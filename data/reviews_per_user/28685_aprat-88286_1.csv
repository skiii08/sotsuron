The Ring," Too many unanswered questions!
","If u wanna just watch a movie to get your adrenaline pumping, then it's okay if u watch this. Because other than a little thrill, there's nothing in this movie. Good thing about this, is that it has some scary scenes which will give you goosebumps. A big thumbs up for the makeup artist. Costumes were mediocre. Writing is shit(maybe it's better in the original version), and directing is okay. Acting is also okay, although I expecte more from Naomi Watts.
 
Throughout the movie I had so many questions! I kept thinking 'why?'. You will know what I'm talking about if you've watched the movie. Well, it was 2002 when it was released, and it's 2018 now, so there will be a lot of difference between the horror movies made now and at that time. So taking all this in consideration, I rated it 6/10.The conclusion would be; watch it. That's the better thing to do. Or if you have already watched it, then I don't think you'd be regretting it.",6,0,1,9 February 2018
