Hereditary," Wtf did I just watch?
",Wow. This was utter crap for me.. From beginning to end. How this can have this good of a score is way beyond me...better bring the booze for this. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in.. A very very very long time..,1,4,9,13 October 2018
Life," Horrible
","Wow. It was not my idea to watch this movie, but I ended up watching it. This was just horrible from start to the end. The plot is almost non existing and the acting is poor and so one and so on..This is though what happens, spend a lot of money on poorly executed movies instead of making good ones. So they are in space and they all seem like they just got dropped off at some point. Just a bunch of random people at some space station collecting information about Mars? Finally they end up finding something and then it all goes south from there. How it manages to just go downhill is way beyond me, I mean, did they also find the stupidest people to randomly drop on that space station? How were they selected? What purpose did they really serve? Did mankind rely on these people for some reason? There are so many questions and none of them got answered. Plot holes, bad script and stupid decisions. And what of that alien guys? Come on. How silly was that one..? And they friggin gave it a name..I must admit I don't care much for movies with aliens to begin with, but I mean, this was just stupid and Calvin looked like some vegetable or a sea horse of sorts. I just started laughing at some point during the movie, not because it was entertaining, but because of the stupidity of the whole thing. And also - the ending? *Shakes head* Lets not hope it gives room for a sequel.This is probably the worst movie I have seen in a while. I gave it 3 just to be nice. Don't watch this unless you are super hungover, soo bored that nothing helps, have time to waste or something. Not worth you time at all. Trust me on this one.",3,0,1,22 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," Reading the reviews is more entertaining than the movie
","Wow. OK, I must admit I might not be the world's #1 alien movie fan, but I do appreciate different genres and I always try to give movies a chance. This movie though. I had way more fun reading all the bad reviews. Film was a mess. Nothing to see here. You should try to sleep through it, you will most likely have more fun sleeping. Everything about this movie made me face palm myself, laugh (like this crazy tormented laugh), toss hands in despair out in the air...Nothing made sense. Stay away. And if you insist on watching it..better crack open some beers, you will need it!",1,3,5,4 August 2017
