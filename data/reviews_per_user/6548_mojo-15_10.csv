Requiem for a Dream," A grand message placed upon a tedious story.
","**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see*** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsBOMB = Not of a viewable quality<ul><li>Requiem for a Dream = ***</li></ul><ul><li>Unrated (for pervasive drug use, sexual content including some considerably graphic activity, for strong language and some graphic violence)</li></ul>I remember when I first saw the trailer for this film.  I wanted to see it so bad almost instantly; I love all the art-house films with flashy style such as RUN LOLA RUN and NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  Then, as I learned more about the film, I became drawn into the plot and my craving to see it grew more intense.  Why not just see it, you say?  A different subject, but the film's harsh NC-17 reputation kept my age group out of theaters.  I had to wait for the DVD release.When I finally saw it, I have to say I was not as impressed as I thought I would be.  Maybe it was because I built it up too much in my mind beforehand or whatever, but for some reason it just wasn't as effective as I had imagined.  The first half of the film is great.  I cannot deny that.  All the characters are leading such happy lives and it gives that happiness off to the audience in vibes; perhaps this is why watching the last half was just so dreary: Hubert Selby, Jr. completely murdered his array of potentially content lives - and director Arronofsky doesn't spare the viewer a moment to look away.I disagree when commentors here say that the final images are brutal and disturbing... it is not so much the violence as it is watching your best friends suffer and atrophy.  Does the film make it's point?  Of coarse. Should they screen it in high schools?  Absolutely not.  The story was far too small and closely focused; broader issues of drugs are much more effective, not saying what CAN happen.  I guess I just think the plot feels a little set up.However, this is not to say that the film is bad.  The film is very good. And I compliment it's makers with all my strength for daring to at least go a little further forward in terms of intensity than past films similar in theme.  See it for yourself and you'll know what I mean.",8,1,3,16 October 2001
Se7en," Absorbing crime drama, with moderately disappointing climax.
","**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see*** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsBOMB = Not of a viewable quality<ul><li>Se7en = ***</li></ul><ul><li>Rated 'R' (for grisly, gory images, and for language)</li></ul>'SE7EN' combines a sophisticated, crime plot, with a fun, heavy-metal type quality lingering in the background.  The atmosphere is grim and unsettling: perfect and delicious.  The first 3/4 of it are absorbing and gripping; an above-average thriller.  As the film moves onward, the first few of the climactic sequences ease up, and the killer is revealed.  But that's just the beginning...Personally, I hated the killer.  I thought he/she was annoying and typical. Also, I think that screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker made a mostly unnoticeable but wounding mistake: the killer is 'out in the open' for too long.  I think that his/her mysticism, which kept tension for the first hour and a half, was the coolest thing going, but it was killed in the end, like a vampire burning in the open sun.But don't let this stop you from picking it up with a box of pizza on the way home from work - you'll like it almost definately.",7,0,1,19 August 2001
Fight Club," Starts off well, then...

I noticed from the beginning of the titles, with the rock 'n' roll in the background, that it would be good without a doubt.  The first twenty minutes were very interesting, and the next hour after that was so intriguing, I thought I was in love.Soon after, however, things got a little bizarre, and that comfy, welcoming atmosphere was beginning to vanish.  The plot was becoming stranger and stickier by the moment.  I'm not sure if the shocking ending, which seem to be so popular these days, struck me as cool or disappointing.  It left me with an awe which would keep me thinking about it for days.The acting is fun, with plenty of fighting for the guys and enough of Pitt for the girls.  It shouldn't be considered mediocre or below for any young people out there at all.  It certainly wasn't for me.  It's just that the immediate ending was very abrupt after a long climax and it left me with thought-provoking sensations.  Definately a must see, even if not entirely enjoyable.",7,0,2,22 August 2001
Fargo," The best modern Noir out there.
","**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see*** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsBOMB = Not of a viewable quality<ul><li>Fargo = ****</li></ul><ul><li>Rated 'R' (for strong grisly violence, pervasive language, and some sexuality/nudity)</li></ul>The Coen Brothers put on the best show they are capable of (and are still known for) right here, in 'FARGO.'  The story is simple and elegant, while the script is equally plain and appealing.  The casting director really scored big with this one; all roles are perfect and acted out with amazing precision, especially McDormand, but then again, who didn't know that?Oh, but that's not all.  The direction is compact and clean-cut, and the dark tale of a kid-napping gone wrong is oddly mixed with humor and satire, and it even makes fun of northerners accents!  It works!  The Burwell score is one of the most enlightening and spine-tingling of the 90s.  The Roger Deakins cinematography is again, very simple but masterful.  Even the run-time of the movie fits in to the other factors; the length is enjoyably short and easy to handle.You might as well buy this movie without seeing it first; you'll love it!",9,0,2,3 September 2001
The Evil Dead," A true cult classic.
","Folks, this film defines 'cult.'  I love a good horror film, but these days the're just so hard to find... so when you catch something like 'The Evil Dead,' you just can't help but feel jazzed.I was 13 when I saw this movie (but don't let that marr your opinion of the proceeding words) and I was truly scared.  I love that adrenaline rush, and this one delivers it.  It wasn't the gore - this is one of the few films that puts the viewer on unstable ground and makes them nervous, and THEN uses gore to heighten the terror.  Blood and guts doesn't do the trick alone.  Sam Raimi, the genious that he is, uses masterful techniques that thousands of striving directors lunge for but miss so terribly.Wait for a stormy night, put off dinner for a while if you're squeemish, pop in the videocasette, and enjoy!  You'll truly love it.  I know I'm always disappointed when I rent a tape with high hopes and it turns out to be a dud.  But this is one of the few films, along with 'Dawn of the Dead,' 'The Hills Have Eyes,' and the uncensored version of 'Natural Born Killers', that have managed to frighten and disturb me!'The Ultimate Experience in Gruelling Terror.'  I give it *** out of four (hey, I like horrors, but this aint no 'Gone With the Wind').  Carefull though, it is NC-17...what with all that goop and all.",7,0,0,27 July 2001
The Piano," The best modern epic... a sheer delight!

This movie compares to 'GONE WITH THE WIND.'  I liked it more than 'SCHINDLER'S LIST,' and i am ashamed that it only got a 7-point-something on the IMDB scale.  It should be in the high 8s and somewhere in the top 50 of the infamous '250 List.'From the moment this film fades open from black, the gorgeous music will sweep you off your feet and into another world.  And when I say it is a joy to watch, I literally mean it.  The lush colors and swirls of light are comparable to a Monet masterpiece set spinning in motion.  Costumes, art direction, and cinematography all contribute.I don't know how long it took to film this movie, but it must have taken for ever; all of the actor's movements and expressions are *perfect.*  I LOVE HOLLY HUNTER!  She carries such strength in her face and is so reasonable to watch, and her eyes speak more than words ever could.  She deserved that Best Actress Oscar more than any other actress of the decade.  Sam Neil, Harvey Kietel and Anna Paquin are *equally* as good.The script and direction is first rate.  The dialogue is crisp, realistic and memorable.  The movie carries itself so gracefully, just like the main character in her lavish hoop dress.  Oh, people, rent it!",9,1,5,24 August 2001
Halloween," A must-see horror film - and I mean that.
","****   =  A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 =  A classic in time; simply a must see***    =  A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2  =  A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws**     =  May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2   =  Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsBOMB   =  Not of a viewable quality<ul><li>Halloween = ***1/2</li></ul><ul><li>Rated 'R' (for horror with some violence, brief sexuality and drug use, and for some nudity)</li></ul>The Bible of the teenage slasher film, this low-budget clencher will, if nothing else, gain your respect for thrilling the audience withought splattering them with body parts.  The impressionistic, German-style, Gothic cinematography takes the place of graphic stabbings; the darkly-lit killer POV shots replace gory aftermaths... and the results speak for themselves.'HALLOWEEN,' which has so far spawned eight sequels, is a mix between 'FRIDAY THE 13'-style  slaughtering episodes with sheer suspenseful brilliance, ala 'PSYCHO.'  It is composed of not only style, but the forever classic horror plot line: a set of vulnerable (and attractive) victims must battle THE SHAPE in a startlingly claustrophobic 24-hour time frame.  But, then again, one has to wonder: is this the ever infamous plotline that was used in 'HALLOWEEN' or *created* from it?To top it all off, the compact, 90 minute film is layered with an intense, haunting score, for which 'HALLOWEEN' was given the first word in fear.  If anyone has always been skeptical about the horror genre, this is the perfect film to realize the quality possibilities it has to offer.  It's just too bad that films aren't made to this caliber anymore... but on second thought, that would render art works such as this average, which they are anything but.",8,4,5,15 August 2001
Halloween," The best slasher ever!
","I believe, along with thousands, that this is the best slasher movie ever created.  I say 'slasher' because I also love Hitchcock's PSYCHO and catagorizing the two seperately enabelizes me to say they are both the best. Because they are the best, PSYCHO the best horror film, and HALLOWEEN the best slasher/thriller film.  By today's standards, this film is full of cliched situations and sub plots, but in its time, these horror cliches were just being born, and therefore makes this film one of the most original and scary films out there.  Gore is minimal, instead the film relies on clever camerawork and suspense as it's successful qualities.  A must!  It's not CASABLANCA and it's not CHILDREN OF THE CORN, so i give it ***/****, and for a horror flick, folks, that's unbelievable!",8,0,0,4 September 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," The best modern thriller there is.
","**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see*** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsBOMB = Not of a viewable quality<ul><li>The Silence of the Lambs = ****</li></ul><ul><li>Rated 'R' (for grisly, graphic images, language, and some nudity)</li></ul>When I hear people talk about this film, it seems like it is some sort of horror movie with excessive, extreme gore.  It really agitates me because in fact this is almost the opposite of the truth.  'THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS' is not a horror, but an intense drama - a thriller.  There is violence only when necessary or to accentuate a particular scene.  However, it is the manner in which the film is presented that intensifies the plot.  It is a mature drama.All scenes are grim and eerie; director Demme is to blame for all the bold, creepy images and camera work.  But still, 'SILENCE' retains something more than just a creep-fest: the plot is as tight as a rope holding a two ton piano, and the dialogue is crisp and sophisticated.  Howard Shore's haunting score is equally as jarring.In short, this film rings truth and still manages to creep.  I wouldn't say 'scare,' although I'm sure some would.  It's just a well-produced drama, as I say, brought up to the next level.  And it's very good.",9,1,2,22 August 2001
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Fun, compelling, and scary flick - Craven style.
","**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see*** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsBOMB = Not of a viewable quality<ul><li>A Nightmare on Elm Street = ***1/2</li></ul><ul><li>Rated 'R' (for horror violence/gore, some language, and brief sexuality and nudity)</li></ul>This movie is not only scary, unlike the other Nightmare films, but it also has a fun atmosphere, and characters that you can relate to in a way that makes viewing the film fun.  It represents an incredible leap in pounding music and other stylistic qualities, and it has a story line, unlike something similar to 'FRIDAY THE 13th,' which is plotless.Heather Langenkamp is a lot of fun to watch, as is Johnny Depp in his first notion picture role.  These teenagers make the movie very viewer-friendly, instead of other drab flicks of the time period which plummet you with unpleasantness; 'NIGHTMARE' has that rare quality of blending terrifying moments with a remarkably enjoyable movie (I don't mean 'SCREAM'-scary, I mean SCARY!).This is the movie that spawned six sequels and dazzled audiences with grisly effects - despite its low budget.  My advice: pick up the tape at the nearest Blockbuster ASAP!",7,0,0,18 August 2001
