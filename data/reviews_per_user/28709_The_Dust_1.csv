Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ONE FUN MOVIE
","I know you people have probably read hundreds of reviews about this movie already (as I have as well), so I'll try to keep it short and down to business.This movie kicked a**.  Sure there were problems, but the good far out do the bad.  More than anything, it just lets you know that we're in for one hell of a ride in the next two movies.  So much has yet to happen!The movie begins kind of awkward- I guess much like Episode IV first did. Lucas throws the audience in the middle of a trade dispute.  Dialogue is exchanged quickly and the plot is a little muddled until about 30 minutes through the movie.  Everything then quiets down a bit and the movie really takes off.The aliens have wierd fake French accents and stuff.  I don't why that was in there.  The Jar Jar issue- he wasn't very annoying, but sometimes the movie took way too much effort in letting us know what he was up to at every second.  There were some unneeded little shots here and there that dwelled on Jar Jar entirely too long.  But who cares???  This is STAR WARS!!!A very creative movie.  When all is said and done and the circle is complete (all 6 movies are made), this will probably be known as the worst of them, but really the more I think about this movie the more I want to go back. I'm glad this movie didn't swell on familiar characters too much- everything is entirely new.  Have fun with it, and don't worry that Darth Maul is only in it for 6 minutes.  It just makes him more mysterious...I give it a 9 out of 10.  It lives up to the hype pretty damn well.==The Dust==",Null,0,0,15 May 1999
