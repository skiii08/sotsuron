Your Name.," A Compelling and Captivating Journey
","I went to see 'Your Name' (Kimi no na wa) at an art house theater and when I did, I was left compelled and in awe of how such a story really grew on me. The thematic material felt remarkably similar to Hayao Miyazaki's way of storytelling that it makes director Makoto Shinkai look like he now follows in the same ranks as the renowned filmmaker (even if Shinkai himself humbly says it's an 'overestimation' when being compared to Miyazaki).The plot revolves around a teen named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, who have never met and live in opposite sides of Japan. For some unknown circumstance, they randomly switch bodies back and forth while they sleep and live each other's daily lives. During that time, they learn more about their likes, dislikes, activities, the people they know, and places they go to up until they reach a point of understanding one another on an emotional level that they must meet in person.Shinkai definitely unveiled such a setup with vibrant settings of both Japan's countryside and its traditional customs. Likewise for the overwhelming, yet lively urban city of Tokyo and especially the assortment of likable characters that it had a great balance of both good humor and touching moments. Although the motif of switching bodies has been done numerous times in past films or shows for years, this however provided a deeper sense of atmospheric warmth and compassion occurring between both Taki and Mitsuha. Not to mention the use of the proverbial Red String of Fate used as a metaphor to emphasize their connection. I acknowledge that Shinkai admitted in one interview that he wanted to keep expanding on the movie's mythos and pathos, but couldn't for studio-related reasons. As for me, I felt that perhaps there could've been more done as well (namely on the film's epilogue), but nevertheless it's a movie that flowed seamlessly well with an interesting blend of music done by J-rock band Radwimps that I wasn't left bored in the least.Moral: Trust your heart by running down the uncertain path and see that you'll feel this sense of yearning you never knew you had.I certainly did.",9,3,6,27 April 2017
Rocketman," Uniquely Done and Impressive Performance By Taron Egerton
","In the wake of previous music biopic Bohemian Rhapsody with Rami Malek as Freddy Mercury months prior, RocketMan is a welcoming addition in that genre and worth looking into regarding music great Sir Elton John. 'Kingsman' star Taron Egerton portrays the legend with such a unique performance that he's basically not trying to imitate or impersonate him by look or how he sang, but an embodiment of what Elton went through in his lifetime with its ups and downs.His costars Bryce Dallas Howard, who portrays his cold-hearted mother was quite troubling to watch, including the struggles of finding his calling in life during the 70s and 80s. Whereas actor Jamie Bell as longtime friend and lyricist Bernie Taupin was pretty uncanny. Whether it was performing for small crowds, meeting people who would give him his big break (and ultimately one betraying him at one point), addiction, or a self-identity he would establish on his own altogether, he would find his way around.I say that this is a music biopic that seems to capture the essence of how Elton John came to be. Egerton's way of singing some of his hit songs was worth listening to and that he seemed to have captured it flawlessly. I sense awards season has a place for him and this flick.If Sir Elton was able to earn himself a Best Original Song Oscar for 'The Lion King' back in the mid-90s, I think there just might be room for Taron Egerton to earn a nod as well.Although this movie depicted how troubling his life was in the beginning - including a few fictional moments that is likely meant to keep the story going - there's always that glimmer of hope that can only be achieved your own way.",9,22,42,7 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A Retelling That Has A Story Worth Telling
","This has got to be a definitely intriguing flick. Actor Bradley Cooper taking on the mantle as both director and star right alongside singer Lady Gaga, this was pretty deep and versatile for the former. Since the film is its own version by not following too closely to the 1976 movie starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson the performances were phenomenal and touching when putting yourself into the characters' shoes.Brad Cooper's character Jackson Maine is a successful musician. Yet plagued by drug and alcohol addiction which causes problems on himself and those around him. And upon meeting aspiring singer Ally (Lady Gaga), things begin to take a new turn for him.It's like when the most dramatic and troubling moments occur amongst the main two, it feels relatable as though you know them and their personal troubles too well. And know how it may affect you on an emotional level when things turn bitter and put-offish. I've met a couple during my college days in the past with relationship troubles almost similar to this and I have to say it's something that shouldn't be taken lightly. I noticed at my local theater that the majority of the audience were mostly composed of women and not many guys, so it would make sense on how this movie affects them through both triumph and tragedy from a woman's perspective.This looks to be a great movie that provides a sense of escapism for those willing to explore the music side of Brad Cooper and Lady Gaga's acting side (which I noticed is a role-reversal in their professions). True, it felt kind of slow in a few parts, but I see potential in what more Lady Gaga can do from here and glad Streisand herself gave her blessing. Not bad neither on Cooper's directorial debut. No doubt this movie will make awards season. It takes the spotlight and owns it with singing prowess done impressively by Cooper and Gaga.",8,1,2,16 October 2018
The Maze Runner," Delivers Potential from the Intricate Path of the YA Genre
","When it comes to young adult (or YA) books-turned-films, I usually tend to ignore such when they release into movie theaters and try to rent it on DVD when it's available. However, upon reading several positive reviews from a few notable top movie critics regarding the genre's latest movie adaptation 'The Maze Runner,' I decided to give it a shot to see if their reviews live up to what they had seen on screen. By the time I walked out of the theater I remained puzzled, yet my expectations were met and I was growing eager on what lies ahead for the main characters.The story about an amnesiac youth named Thomas is sent into a giant maze surrounded by other trapped boys calling themselves the Glade. Although he tries to regain his lost memories as well as figuring out why he and his fellow captives are there to begin with, he finds out that for the past three years, the Glade routinely sends out Runners to find a way out of the difficult labyrinth. To solve this mystery, they must work together (along with a girl who seems to have ties with Thomas) and escape the perilous, constantly-shifting path waiting before them, or be forever trapped like rats in a maze.Unlike the previous abundance of YA (female dominated) book-turned-films that proved unappealing and leaning mostly towards predictability (with the exception of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Hunger Games'), I best describe this movie adaptation of James Dashner's famed book series as an intricately dark premise, yet engaging in content. It's one of those YA rarities that actually turn up as successful to both critics and audiences, but seems to now have its aim toward the male half among the large abundance of female audiences. Lead star Dylan O'Brien (of MTV's Teen Wolf) delivered such a believable and interesting performance as memory-impaired Thomas as he tries to discover his true purpose by stepping up and proving his worth among his fellow captives. Actor Will Poulter also created quite a game changer in this role compared to his previous films ('Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader,' 'We're the Millers') as tough guy Gally. While the only female lead Kaya Scodelario balanced out the seriousness and the sensitivity among the Glade members as Teresa. As a whole, it seems to have the dystopian, thrilling elements of 'The Hunger Games' crossed with the male-driven survival themes of 'Lord of the Flies' with ominous tones of NBC's 'Revolution.' Since it's basically composed of an almost entirely male cast of characters (save for the only female lead), there are moments I've noticed where some scenes still remain unclear and need to be re-watched to understand it carefully. The tension and adrenaline just kept building up as more uncertainties within the bewildering labyrinth are explored, from encountering ferocious creatures called Grievers to the frequently-shifting walls that form new pathways to different sections, and a mysterious organization called W.C.K.D. With all these elements, including a strong cast and story, it has the potential to reach the ranks of the few significant others in the pool of YA film adaptations. Can't wait to see what the movie's sequel has to offer. It definitely follows the trail left behind by 'The Hunger Games.' Needless to say, the trials have barely just begun.",9,1,3,22 September 2014
Zootopia," Versatile Disney Takes On PC Culture
","Ever since the turn of the 2010s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been skyrocketing than ever before with great momentum. From an aspiring restaurateur who became a frog, a princess with long magical hair, a bad guy wanting to be good, a tale of two sisters, and even a troubled boy with his inflatable robot companion. For their latest flick called Zootopia, it's an intriguing caper comedy that not only spoofs the buddy-cop detective formula or noir like in 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but also tackles the themes that exist in PC (politically correct) culture. In this day and age, political correctness has been ongoing with the media exploiting the misunderstandings and atrocities happening in current events such as injustice and discrimination. Thinking back on the old 1946 Disney film Song of the South featuring characters Br'er Fox and Br'er Rabbit, that's where PC is finally drawn into this movie's characters and 'species-ism' is tested.Jason Bateman (Horrible Bosses, Paul) voices con artist, street smart fox Nick Wilde as he makes a living in the animal-inhabited metropolis hustling various individuals. At the same time rural rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Once Upon A Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) has just arrived in the big city to begin her first day as the first rabbit officer. Although swift, skilled, and able to hold out on her own, fellow officers don't exactly see her capable of reaching their ranks. It's up to both natural enemies to work together when a crime is committed in the seemingly blissful Zootopia, while at the same time learning that they're not so different from each other.I have to say that in the studio's current Revival Era, the animators have really stepped it up a notch by exploring a PC-coated world completely devoid of all humans and where anthropomorphic animals dominate compared to childhood Disney classics I remembered in the 90s. I'm aware that this 'human-less' concept has been done before for many decades during Walt Disney's lifetime and even after his passing, but it looks like nearly everything actually stands out from spoofed product placements to the current trends of music, technology, fashion, and lifestyle. Disney's 1973 movie Robin Hood helped open that door when adding animals in place of the usual human characters, but this time more attention to detail from the largest to the tiniest in the architectural designs looking like a cross between Times Square and Dubai (heck, even a hint of San Fransokyo). And then there's its inhabitants; they are what makes this entire movie look appealing, inviting, relatable, and immersive. Gazelle's (Shakira) song 'Try Everything' was also pretty entrancing to my ears. Disney easter eggs are also pleasing to keep a look out for (try finding some!)To conclude, although the movie does slightly ride off its rails in some scenes involving the lack of exploring further into the other regions that connect to the big city and a concept of an individual who is ostracized based on who they are or what they look like is vaguely similar to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph; it recovers with a thoughtful moral about the big city with real-life social issues and stereotypes being overwhelming and even troubling sometimes. But it's really about finding your true potential and not letting naysayers get the better of you. This isn't just some kids' movie, there's thematic material adults may relate to as well. I can already predict Oscar nods awaiting, too. Go see it and find out for yourself.",8,8,20,3 March 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A Disney Film At Its Best!
","After watching the entire film, the words that best describe 'Prince of Persia' are 'dazzling' and 'impressive.' The storyline was executed really well and the action moments were brilliantly crafted. Some may pass the movie off as another CGI drivel, but I say that the CGI effects proved beneficial in keeping the story going. As the story goes, it's all about a rogue prince (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is framed for the murder of his adoptive father. With the help of a princess (Gemma Arterton) and a mystical dagger that can turn back time, he must right a few wrongs that have been put onto him.What I have to say about this video game-based movie is that it could have been slightly improved in terms of character development and that the movie should have been a little longer in terms of adding a little more detail of each essential character and setting. The film doesn't necessarily need to borrow every element of the original video game, what really matters is how well those elements can be interpreted in the form of film.I may have never played the video games, but I must say actor Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Prince Dastan is starting to follow in the same steps (i.e. an adventurous persona with a hint of comedic moments) as what Johnny Depp did as Captain Jack Sparrow and Tobey Maguire for Spider-Man. If you're into action-adventure, here's a film that's NO exception.",9,1,5,29 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Very Impressive and Accelerating!
","This was an excellent film! It certainly didn't let me down at all!!! I enjoyed every single ounce of the film (especially the remaining scene after the rolling credits)! So, the crew rescues Captain Jack Sparrow, and now all the pirates (including the resurrected Hector Barbossa) must band together to put an end to Lord Beckett's reign and the curse of the Flying Dutchman (in order for Will Turner to save his father Bootstrap Bill).Overall, this film is beyond amazing! I couldn't stop watching every fight scene, it was truly worth it! Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer did NOT disappoint me!",10,3,5,25 May 2007
Ready Player One," Wired and Geared Up! Log On to Spielberg's Virtual Thrill Ride!
","I was overwhelmed with the last four decades of pop culture nods and tributes to video games, TV, music, and film throughout that I didn't even know where to begin on this! The virtual concept began to remind me of titles with near similar parallels to Sword Art Online and Dot Hack Sign in terms of individuals who enjoy online gaming, but find an objective that will change their lives completely compared to ordinary play. Whereas the destructive action sequences are reminiscent to say, Tron and Akira.In 2045, Wade Watts is an average individual who lives a derelict lifestyle in the slums he calls 'The Stacks.' He finds his escapism by entering a virtual realm called The OASIS, where its creator and founder James Halliday has unfortunately died. In his video will, he may grant one player astounding wealth to those who can find an Easter egg he personally hid somewhere in this virtual space, leading to an all-out treasure hunt.Since the mid-70s, Steven Spielberg has taken his audiences on many adventures in various places of different eras whether it be fantasy or even real-life events in history, including meeting the unique characters that appear onscreen. They would fascinate, enthrall, or even touch us in an emotional way and Ready Player One (based on the book by author Ernest Cline) is another interesting addition to his library of amazing titles. The cast did splendidly, especially Tye Sheridan as the lead guy Wade who starts off as a simple gamer with no ambition. Then upon meeting unique users that share similar interests, it's a team-up that's worthwhile. Likewise for TJ Miller as mercenary and scene stealer I-Rok is a great stand out. I may not have read the book at all, but it doesn't really matter if you did or not. Never once was I lost in the film's story. The choice of classic 70s and 80s era songs also provided mesmerizing accompaniment and nowhere short of spectacular in the most pivotal scenes. It also contributes to a lesson in the consequences of greed, technological dependency, and non-conformity in the film's true nature. Left me pondering over how society may reach this fate if not tread lightly.Won't be disappointed. Pop culture at its finest! GAME ON!",8,1,5,2 April 2018
Moana," Wayfinding Into New Territory with A Likable Heroine and Interesting Tale
","I still can't believe my eyes in what I just saw. The visuals of Polynesian culture, tranquil vegetation, an immersive oceanic setting that's a living entity of its own, expressive songs performed magnificently by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho (I have to also credit The Rock having some singing chops too), and the character dynamics all kept my attention that it summed up yet another dazzling successor from this year's caper film Zootopia by the crew at Disney. Moana definitely has spunk and a spiritual personality mirroring that of Pocahontas crossed with a hint of Lilo Pelekai that my attention shifted quickly on where her adventure will take her next.The story of Moana is that she's a free-spirited Polynesian individual who dreams of following her own path beyond her home in the Pacific Islands ever since she can barely walk. However when her home island of Motunui is threatened by a mysterious supernatural being and given the guidance of her wise grandmother, she must venture out in the ocean waters to find the demigod Maui where they must team up to put an end to the chaos.The chemistry between Auli'i Cravalho voicing the leading heroine Moana and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson voicing demigod Maui began to somewhat remind me of the witty banter between characters of previous Disney animated films (Zootopia and Wreck-It Ralph to name a few) as well as a cross between the whimsical Genie of 'Aladdin' and reluctant personality of Phil from 'Hercules' on Maui's end. Not to mention his tattoos are also appealing because they seem to have a mind of their own and him spouting a couple wisecracking meta-references in some parts of the film were pretty laughable. Notably, the song 'How Far I'll Go' is enthralling and stands out the most among the other well-written music pieces, giving a sort of 'Lion King' chill to it. Broadway playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) definitely laid his cards out on the table by unveiling a few catchy songs and the collaborations with both Jemaine Clement and South Pacific Fusion singer Opetaia Foa'i made the ambiance feel more culturally serene and enchanting at the same time.Directors John Musker and Ron Clements have certainly come a long way spanning well over three decades under Disney since I remembered their work dating back to 1986. Whether it be The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules, or even Princess and the Frog, they've certainly pushed their boundaries further from their usual 2D animated flicks and wayfinding into 3D terrain with an intriguing story on how one heroine doesn't need a prince to rescue her or fall in love with (though an animal sidekick is a must). No, instead the focus is about finding the path that suits you along with the perils that lie ahead and seeing that there is good somewhere within. But hey, no one said it would be easy.Look out, awards season. This is definitely a must-see and I applaud the amazing cast and crew for weaving such a tale.",9,6,23,23 November 2016
Crash," Jarring Misconceptions and Piquing Racial Tension in Modern Day L.A.
","During this time of Black History Month, racial injustice and discrimination has been much talked about when reflecting back on the Civil Rights Movement. For 'Crash' on the other hand, this is a movie that didn't focus on one race or ethnicity that was harshly ridiculed or even having to suffer at the hands of others who think they are of a higher class. No, instead it was about how racial tension is still out there even in modern times, especially during the aftermath of September 11th still reverberating heavily on some individuals of other ethnic backgrounds at the time.The ensemble cast that features Brendan Fraser, Terrance Howard, Michael Pena, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, and Ryan Philippe provided a point of view of how each of their characters' lives crossed paths in daily life of Los Angeles. While having to deal with racial stereotypes in either the workplace or even out on some of LA's derelict streets, it becomes clear they would do anything to persevere in their own lives no matter what the consequences may be.I found it intriguing that director Paul Haggis (Walker Texas Ranger) wanted us to view the scope of L.A.'s imperfections since he himself stated that one of his inspirations for the movie was a night when he was carjacked in those streets. Upon watching this with a group of colleagues, what I saw in the violence, anger, and hatred; it was all clouded with prejudicial misunderstandings and uncertainty, whether shocking or saddening. When confronted in a harsh scenario, the character would begin to view the context of it differently and thus leading to misconceptions. I was left fascinated that the bigotry and egotistical nature of some of these people were explored in public, when really they can be quite the contrary when in the comfort of their own homes or in the company of family or friends.I'm aware of the debate and controversy that surrounded the Oscars when this won Best Picture back in 2005, but with its tense situations, I can see why it received its many accolades. It's not at all perfect, nor would I say this is a spectacular movie, but compelling enough for me and my colleagues to discuss the issues with one another.The moral: While our paths may cross with one another and not all of them may get off to a good start at first (especially involving who we are or what their lives are like), there's a clear thought of what really matters and that depends on how you see it.",8,1,2,16 February 2017
Tangled," Disney Never Ceases to Amaze Me!!
","Before I begin the review, I must say that Disney has made quite an accomplishment in making this the 50th animated movie in their history since 'Snow White' back in 1937! What an era that was! As for the movie, changing the title to 'Tangled' from 'Rapunzel' does indeed reach out well with its young audiences. The cast was well-selected, the animation was complex, yet brilliantly crafted, and the song arrangements felt traditional in terms of what the past Disney fairy tale-based films had done before, which captured my attention and kept me interested even more. After all, Mandy Moore did a stunning job providing the speaking and singing voice of Rapunzel herself. The song titled 'I See the Light' was very noteworthy among them all since I felt a similar, positive feeling as I did with Aladdin's 'A Whole New World.'I wasn't bored in the least on the storyline, it made me want to see more as the plot began to develop even further. At one point, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the two main characters' (Flynn and Rapunzel) inner struggles and how they really feel about one another, but that's exactly what I was hoping! Growing up among Disney's most memorable canon animated films throughout its history has been something I've followed since I was born (the late 1980s). I have seen all of the previous 49 animated movies and 'Tangled' has definitely made itself worthy to reside in its rightful place as the official #50! THIS is a must-see and I think I'll be looking forward into seeing it again and again whenever I choose!",10,18,21,6 December 2010
American Sniper," Chris Kyle: Gripping and Purposeful
","Witnessing what I had watched in American Sniper, I was left baffled and speechless on seeing how one American soldier sacrificed so much for his family and country by fighting his way through the 2003 Iraq War. Being based on the popular memoir, I had to see what the film adaptation had in store.Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) was certainly one accomplished individual. By enlisting for the Navy SEALs, he knew how much his life would change when his training would eventually make him a skilled sniper. Upon finding love in his would-be wife Taya Renae (Sienna Miller), things further complicate Kyle when he goes on to serving 4 tours in Iraq. At the same time trying to maintain his civilian life with his wife and 2 little kids who eagerly await for his return.Regardless of his elder age, director Clint Eastwood did a splendid job taking the helm by putting Chris Kyle in the spotlight. He captured the inner struggles Kyle and his fellow SEALs went through in the War on Terror and didn't stray completely away from the 'civilian life' scenes as to ease the tension. In particular, I found the scene where Kyle made his first sniper kill on an armed woman and kid to be really significant. It's like you can tell he feels guilt and unnoticeably shaken on what he just did before him. Not to mention that small bible he carries in his pocket added a nice touch of symbolism. How? It seems to represent that no matter what circumstance he faced in childhood to adulthood, not once did he ever lose faith on what truly mattered.Perhaps in some instances of the movie, the representation of the U.S. Serviceman or Navy SEAL is over-glorified and vain, but I say that Brad Cooper embraced the role proudly and really brought out the angst Chris Kyle and his comrades had to endure in such a harsh, war-driven environment. Comparing this movie to other past war films like Saving Private Ryan, The Great Raid, or Green Zone, you can feel just as much tension when you picture yourself in their shoes. I can literally hear faint weeping and silent conversations among the audience as triumph and tragedy graced the screen.To conclude, you can tell Brad Cooper underwent rigorous training, but now I see what earned him his Oscar nod. Although several may debate that Chris Kyle doesn't deserve to be called a 'hero,' nevertheless Cooper channeled him marvelously and Clint Eastwood impressively displayed Kyle's imperfect, yet valiant efforts.",8,9,20,31 January 2015
Split," Bizarre and Oddly Disturbing Psychological Thriller
","Following from his 2015 soft comeback film 'The Visit,' director M. Night Shyamalan's next suspenseful thriller titled 'Split' was already an intrigue with the plot centering around James McAvoy's character having an unusual personality disorder. This had me jumping back to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho, but unlike Anthony Perkins' unhinged Norman Bates with his one 'Mother' persona, McAvoy's Kevin Crumb has twenty-three personas in his complex mind that you'd never know when his normal self is there or not (or anything that is 'normal' for that matter).A psychologist named Dr. Fletcher is trying to learn more about what makes Kevin transition from one personality to the next, but with each one that emerges, it grows even more bizarre since each one has the mindset of a nine-year-old boy, an unknown woman, or a kidnapper named 'Dennis.' It becomes increasingly ambiguous that Fletcher decides to investigate into what each personality had done in life with the help of one of his captives, a young girl named Casey.For this to what could possibly be Shyamalan's next splendid follow-up, I say this is one of his long-awaited return to form. For Split, the way he tries to capture McAvoy's unpredictable notions on camera makes it feel more terrifying every time we try to comprehend each personality carefully. I did get lost in some parts of the film, but knowing McAvoy's past roles in other movies, I always pondered that a few of these personalities might as well be indirectly mirroring some of McAvoy's previous movie roles.It became a psychological thrill ride that my mentality was put to the test and keeping up in some parts proved tricky, but careful observation. The twist ending (which I won't spoil) was uniquely different from the other plot twists Shyamalan had done in his previous projects. This one in particular would be one I found to be very jarring in my opinion (I know, since a few in the audience were quietly deducing a connection). Well played, sir.",7,1,9,18 February 2017
The Lego Movie," An Ever-Expanding Universe with Humor and Heart
","As a kid who grew up in the 90s playing with Lego, I was impressed that the very toy I played (almost on a daily basis) with in grade school and junior high converted into a full-length feature. Though initially skeptic, after witnessing Lego characters old and new - including a few familiar sets of the past - incorporated into one film just blew my mind away. When I arrived on opening day, it was certainly a packed crowd of people looking like they're in their twenties and thirties, along with younger kids of the current generation.The plot, which involves an ordinary Lego construction figure called Emmet (voiced by 'Parks and Recreation' star Chris Pratt) - who lives his life by his own set of instructions - finds a new purpose when coming across the female rebel WyldStyle and a group of others fulfilling a prophecy of finding the new Master Builder to stop the evil Lord Business. Emmet must learn that not everything requires a set of instructions, but a little creativity and imagination can't hurt either, or can it? It had its share of laughs (notably Liam Neeson's split-personality character Good Cop/Bad Cop and Morgan Freeman's Vitruvius tending to steal the humor spotlight), well-crafted settings and animation that seemingly defines the realistic, endless, ever-expanding Lego Universe, and an elaborate set of voice talent greats that have worked with versatile directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller once before. To avoid spoilers, there's a very surprising twist near the end I did not see coming and it definitely doesn't deviate it completely from the movie's main story, but actually supplements it further with an intriguing moral lesson that sounds essentially true in real-life. My only nitpick was that some scenes can turn too frantic that it might need to be observed carefully. Nevertheless, like 'Wreck-It Ralph' and 'Toy Story' before it, this is a movie that sent me on both a nostalgia trip and run of sympathy that it will intrigue many kids and adults young at heart. Even Lego characters have a story to tell, too, even when you least expect it.",9,0,2,22 February 2014
Now You See Me," Cliché, Yet It's A Film with A Talented Cast
","Thinking about how much creativity came into play throughout the film is no easy feat. When I watched it shortly after its first weekend of release back in May 2013, I left the theater curious and constantly pondering over what happens next for the main characters. It certainly took me a while on how to properly critique it, but here goes:The story about a group of four successful illusionists who step out of their average parlor trick performances and into something much bigger when they are given mysterious invitations. When they are caught by the FBI at their sold-out act in Las Vegas, there is little to no evidence to land them behind bars, and therefore released.Stars Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco did outstandingly well as the Four Horsemen with wit, humor, and an intricate amount of knowledge to understand how to enact their plan. For example, I enjoyed the 'Zombieland' nod between Eisenberg and Harrelson (as their personalities in this film started to remind me of their previous work together). Another example is that Dave Franco really stood out when his Jack Wilder character is caught. When confronted by FBI agents while all alone, his knowledge of 'sleight-of-hand' proved beneficial in getting him out of tight spots. Although it does seem deluded and ridiculous that such a thing may happen, it was clever and witty on how it played out on screen. Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent pursuing the Horsemen was good for a few laughs. Every time he thinks he's got them in his grasp, he would usually be left outwitted and dumbfounded as to how it happened to him. The reunion of stars Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine since 'The Dark Knight' films was really interesting. They delivered impressively as supporting characters who are also in pursuit of these performers (usually out of their hands and into that of the authorities) and are just as significant to the film's storyline. In one scene, Freeman's character Thaddeus Bradley quoted as saying, 'leveling the playing field' for both the FBI and the Horsemen, but his true intentions still felt shady.Director Louis Leterrier (Transporter, Unleashed) did a splendid job crafting the entire set-up. It's like Robin Hood meets David Copperfield creatively spliced together. Judging by the various heists the Horsemen pull off, mysteriously robbing a bank without getting caught was only the beginning. I can tell that the film did not rely too heavily on CGI for the complex stunts and that most common tricks shown on screen like sleight-of-hand or disappearing acts were practiced countless hours by the cast. Story-wise, it does feel cliché in terms of a typical caper film (albeit adding illusionary elements into it), but still it's a movie that is worth pondering over because with some surprising twists and a few scenarios left unanswered, it's very possible that Four Horsemen's quest is FAR from over.",9,0,1,8 February 2015
Inside Out," Truly Comes From the Heart
","Owing from Pixar Studios' absence last year - and it's recent over-reliance on prequels and sequels - their latest project titled Inside Out happens to be the most hilarious and emotionally-driven movie ever shown. Not since their last films Up and Toy Story 3 has there ever been a Pixar movie that will make you laugh and even move you by the time it has reached its climactic end.As the story goes, 11-year-old Riley Anderson and her family live a great life in their Minnesota town. But when her father is transferred to a new job in the Bay Area of San Francisco and has the entire family uprooted, Riley has trouble fitting in to this different environment, causing her emotions within to navigate her through a new neighborhood, new school, and new life.When it was near over, I began to take notice there were a few various fellow audience members (fewer kids and mostly adults) quietly tearing up, while it also left the gears in my mind constantly turning and pondering out of curiosity over how much the studio went through to get this concept right. To me, I feel Pixar seems to have finally rebounded from their quality blunders in the early 2010s and focused more on an entirely new, original story that has an equal balance of comedy and drama rather than just one particular genre, which doesn't usually turn out that well when trying to tell it in animated form. With a talented cast voicing the personified emotions like Amy Poehler and Bill Hader (SNL alums), Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, and Phyllis Smith, it's like they really channeled these vibrant, colorful characters with such ease and likability. Newcomer Kaitlyn Dias wasn't bad neither voicing their human host Riley since the character's personality - from my own personal experience - started to remind me of a young niece I know. Director Pete Docter sure cranked out yet another cleverly crafted, amazing story following from his past, touching hits Monsters Inc. and Up. And he certainly meant well when he said that his movies were practically based on his family life, in this case his own preteen daughter Ellie - whom Riley is loosely modeled after.The film's concept feels near-similar to past works like 2001's Osmosis Jones (its concept was well-conceived, but how it contrasts into the real world setting didn't translate well) and the 1943 Disney short titled 'Reason and Emotion.' However the studio managed to push this concept further with an imaginative set-up where the emotions are not just the characters, but by exploring that the mind has endless possibilities and realms for them to wander outside their headquarters, depending on how well Riley's experiences (good or bad) are in the real world. It's like it frequently plays with Isaac Newton's third law of motion. One example of that had Sadness affecting one core memory by touch and it affects Riley not just physically, but mentally as well. Psychologically for an adult, we would easily get the idea if the problem isn't resolved, apathy will further escalate. Not many kids will understand why we feel moved by it, since through their perspective, they'll mostly adore the entire film as a visual and spectacle delight. With that aside, this movie never once disappointed me since it has both ambition and Pixar nostalgia written all over it. I'm also glad that since the emotions' human host is female, the writing crew did not rely on giving Riley stereotypical 'girly' interests. Giving her a tomboy-like trait properly balances out how she can run on both sides.The moral: No matter your age or the life you live, the importance of family and your own well-being shouldn't be overlooked. Your mind says one thing, but from the heart there's something more.On a separate note: Its accompanying short subject titled Lava is definitely worth looking into. One of the best Pixar shorts I've ever witnessed in a while. Not sure why awards season overlooks their short films these days, Lava has quite a story that I consider a love letter to Hawaii.",10,9,36,18 June 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Feeling Rattled. Endgame Is Deep
","In 2008, I was intrigued with what Marvel was planning out after seeing the first Iron Man and its post-credit scene explaining of a wider universe. Now to the present time with the MCU's latest installment Avengers: Endgame - all the heroes and allies we've come to know culminating from 22 MCU movies - leads to an end of a magnificent saga. I did not expect it to be so engaging and downright fun! Joe and Anthony Russo did a splendid job setting up this climactic film. Stars Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, and Scarlett Johansson gave it their all with performances that made their characters as humorous, clever, or just plain deep. What a run alongside the additional familiar faces in this all-star cast. No words can express how much I enjoyed out of this 3-hour spectacle.Three weeks have passed since Infinity War. The Mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) has successfully decimated half the Earth's population with a single snap and the surviving Avengers along with their few remaining allies must find their resolve by setting things right.My curiosity and adrenaline kept growing with each pivotal scene playing out to either interesting cameo appearances to a shock of disbelief and dismay that I even yelped loudly when the final stand commenced. Music composer Alan Silvestri (who has done many other hit cinematic projects in the past) provided an enthralling score that accompanies and compliments the most tragic and triumphant moments of the film. Not to mention the right balance of drama and humor that felt like a roller coaster ride that toyed with my emotions. There were a few people at my local theater that quietly wept as the final act played out and that really caught my attention other than just the huge action scenes onscreen alone. The fate and great sacrifice of Tony Stark in particular, was a nail biter for me since Downey Jr's performance felt so believable as a nearly decrepit who's been through so much trauma. Saddens me The Stan Lee, nor Jack Kirby didn't live to see this spectacle that they and their associates drew and wrote on pages of paper many decades ago, but I have to say their legacies live on as these characters have cemented themselves as living and breathing entities in the world of film.I now see what both critics and audiences alike meant about how brilliant this movie can make anyone laugh, cry, or simply stay engaged. Easter eggs and cameos are also fun to find, especially if it foreshadows potential new heroes yet to be shown. Sure, this movie is not meant for everybody who are likely not into the genre, let alone comics in general. Likewise, I'll admit some scenes did feel somewhat confusing in terms of how the story builds, namely the use of time travel as a plot device was a bit difficult to follow when the rules are applied differently here compared to other past films that used it extensively. Though what matters to me is I was not at all disappointed of the end result spanning 11 years in the making.I applaud them all. Well done, well done.",8,0,3,13 May 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Full-Blown Video Game Nostalgia!
","When I first heard of this movie at a few film conventions/expos, it piqued my interest. When I did, I was dazzled and drooling in 80s/90s video game nostalgia when I saw several familiar video game characters of different companies cameo in of all places a Disney animated feature! Sonic, Paperboy, and even a few Street Fighter characters (I could go on forever about those...)The plot happened to be both intriguing and worth pondering over a few times. Why? Because the idea of an 80s video game 'bad guy' called Ralph trying to redeem himself as a 'good' guy sounds familiar from previous animated films. I mean, he can cross into any game he wants within a local arcade, trying to find a new perspective in life. Feels like 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' (the theme of different franchises crossing together and a somewhat similar subplot) meets 'Toy Story' (characters that have a 'job' to amuse kids and are independent when no one is around).Upon Ralph's meeting of a young girl called Vanellope Von Schweetz in a kart-racing game titled 'Sugar Rush,' it brought out the true emotional tone of the entire film, in my opinion. The pint-sized, 9-year-old sure has a lot of spunk on being a great racer, but the 'brother-sister' relationship between her and Ralph seems to have developed into the big focus.As a small boy back in those glory days of gaming, 8-bit/16-bit games were my favorite past time. Now as an adult, it felt like reliving childhood all over again. These days, video games seems to be more of a guy's thing since there aren't many female gamers (which is why the creation of 'Sugar Rush' was included in the film's premise to balance that). The handful of video game character cameos don't intervene or overshadow the movie's premise. Ralph may not tread millions of miles away from Shrek (as they are characters that are usually feared or resented by others, but deep down they are misunderstood figures that only want to be accepted well in society), but Ralph is a likable big guy that has empathy underneath his destructive nature.",10,5,5,8 December 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Left Speechless with Looming Questions
","One can say that for ten years running the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to amaze and their latest installment 'Avengers: Infinity War' is a constant reminder that these characters have leapt out of their comic book pages and onto the big screen. With an all-star cast of familiar names and faces gracing the screen like Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, and many others, I couldn't fathom how much they went through to finally come together in one movie. Director Joss Whedon helped kick off two Avengers films in 2012 and 2015, but thanks to brothers Joe and Anthony Russo (Captain America: Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War) they've pushed it further with these established characters and have a story worth telling.With the Mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) unleashing destruction in his wake to gather all the Infinity Stones that the heroes have kept safe in the past, it's up to the Avengers to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him at all cost.The Russo Bros. did an excellent job in directing and gathering all these actors who not only gave splendid performances, but had its audience immerse themselves into a whirlwind of triumph and tragedy. Compared to a few past MCU titles, 'Infinity War' had the right balance of both witty humor and drama blended well into the action that it didn't derail the story itself. It kept me intrigued and curious to see what its mythos and pathos can do. When the movie ended, it had me left speechless and with so many questions looming over what lies ahead. I've heard some complaints from some people I've met saying they didn't like it because it didn't flesh out all the characters properly, missing other notable heroes, or lacked depth in the film's story, but I beg to differ. Since this is only the first half, surely its second half will bring this story to a decent close. My only nitpick was indeed that a few other heroes didn't show, but that's okay since they could likely be saved for its follow-up. Compared to past MCU villains, I was intrigued with the directors' approach in making Thanos being more than just a typical power-hungry villain, but somewhat sympathetic as well. Music composer Alan Silvestri's underscore is a brilliant accompaniment to the most pivotal scenes too. To close, this movie is, by far, a culmination of Marvel's wide assortment of heroes raising the bar in their shared universe. Only time will tell on what more can Marvel dish out from here beyond this Phase Three.The works of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Joe Simon are now more than just drawings on comic book pages, they are embodiments who've made their mark in cinema.",8,1,3,30 April 2018
Get Out," Feels Like Standard Paranoia, Yet Driven Down A Different Turn
","I can now see why this psychological horror is so mind-bending. After catching this movie, I have to say that this is a thrill ride that continuously toyed with my perspective up until the terrible truth is unveiled midway into the film.Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a black man with a hobby in photography has a white girlfriend named Rose that live happily together in the city. When she then decides to finally introduce him to her parents in her hometown outside the city, they seem to welcome him in open arms. However, the townsfolk begin to show signs of odd behavior whenever Chris so much as approaches any of them or if he even speaks his mind in conversations. Chris becomes increasingly paranoid as he uncovers more to the town than meets the eye.For comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut in a horror film and his pairing with 'Paranormal Activity' producer Jason Blum, this is something that required more thought as the story began to play out. I honestly attempted to comprehend the motives of each character, but as I started deducing their reasons, it grows unsettling each time. Instead of racism being used as a plot device, it seems this is a bizarre twist on that subject matter by making the residence not racist, yet they add insult to injury in their true nature by giving off a form of liberal ignorance. There are moments in the film that were pretty laughable to ease the tension done by the leading man's best friend TSA Officer Rod (played by comic Lil Rel Howery). And I say this doesn't ruin the ride, more like only gives depth into what his character knows what's best for himself and his friend. In the end, this isn't a movie made for cheap jumps or thrills. Instead, it kept the gears in my mind constantly turning and my curiosity growing with how the horror conventions were approached differently here. It's certainly interesting.",8,10,18,5 April 2017
Frozen," Rekindling A Long-Since Broken Bond
","It's no surprise that Disney has pulled out a new movie for the Disney Animated Features canon. Hastily, I checked out the film on opening day and had to see if what the critics said were true.In a place called Arendelle, two sisters of royal heritage live a splendid life, until one day the older sister Elsa has difficulty controlling her cryokinesis (ice powers) that it ultimately strikes her own sister Anna, endangering her young sibling and herself. With their parents gone and fearing she may do more harm than good, Elsa flees Arendelle to start a new life at the cost of leaving her caring sister behind.Since the film is loosely based on the works of Hans Christian Andersen (author of the story 'The Little Mermaid' which Disney eventually adapted back in 1989), I acknowledge that the critics were right and Disney has one-upped themselves with a compelling and heartfelt story of how the Snow Queen came to be. The voice cast which include Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and Johnathan Groff portrayed characters with such ease and likability along with their unique talent in singing sympathetic, yet upbeat songs that may give chills (no pun intended) running down your spine most notably Idina Menzel's solo of 'Let it Go.' That is the exact impression I felt as a kid watching those classic Disney animated films like 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin,' and 'The Lion King.' Now in my mid-20s and with this new 'Revival Era,' it seems 'Frozen' is matching the ranks of the Disney Renaissance that spawned those animated hits throughout the 1990s. I felt a strong sympathy for these royal sisters of Arendelle. Anna cares very much for her troubled sister no matter what, and she'll do anything to strengthen their childhood bond again. The story itself intrigued me the most (even with an unexpected twist near the end, but I won't spoil it there) because it's basically the theme of 'a bond long-since broken by fear and uncertainty, tries to be rekindled with the power of love and compassion.' I literally heard the audience laugh, react, loudly applaud, and cheer that I can already sense Oscar nominations will not be ruled out. And on a personal note, it's good to point out that there are a few easter eggs referencing past Disney animated films hidden in some scenes, something that's been done since Walt Disney's lifetime and can be surprising if found. No doubt the DVD/Blu-ray release will also be a hit. A definite return to Disney's heyday of animation glory that happened over twenty years ago. 'Frozen' is a movie audiences - kids and adults young at heart - can relate to.",10,85,170,28 November 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Sluggish Story, But Slowly Picks Up the Pace
","Johnny Depp returns to the high seas as Captain Jack Sparrow in this fifth outing of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' titled Dead Men Tell No Tales. It was definitely a movie to watch and I have to admit that it felt pleasing to see a few familiar faces return for old time's sake and a few likable new faces thrown into the mix.The plot centers around Captain Jack as he and his new companions Henry (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina (Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) venture out to search for the mystical Trident of Poseidon believing it would end the curse of Henry's father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). But an old nemesis named Captain Salazar seeks the trident as well and holds a long-standing vengeance against Jack.For a running time of 129 minutes (the shortest of the previous movies), I have to say the story in this latest installment felt slightly more understandable and not as dreary or dismal as its 2011 predecessor On Stranger Tides. Javier Bardem's portrayal of the nefarious Salazar is a formidable foe, but when comparing him to other villains of the previous Pirates films, it feels too routine. Nevertheless, his menacing presence proves that he will resort to any cutthroat tactics to vanquish his enemies (much like Davy Jones).The blending of CGI with practical effects flows seamlessly well and several comedic moments balances out the swashbuckling action that made the film series well-known. To avoid spoilers, there's more to the story once the closing credits finish rolling. It's nowhere close to the ranks as the 2003 original 'The Curse of the Black Pearl,' but it's a movie that definitely stands out on its own. Despite a few sluggish moments in some parts, it was tolerable enough to follow.",7,1,4,1 June 2017
Hidden Figures," Exceptional, Jarring, and Thought-Provoking Unsung Heroes
","Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence, but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the workplace).The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff. Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to completely orbit the Earth.With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama 'Selma' since that too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups. Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama, including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them antagonists) in these women's lives.Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the present. It's sure to go far with various accolades.The moral: If you put your mind to it, things can be accomplished no matter how many would say otherwise.",9,55,113,12 January 2017
Coco," An Emotional Ride: Blends Familiar Pixar Elements with New Cultural Flare
","Before I begin, I will say this: This is worthy of residing in its rightful place in the Pixar library.The story begins where aspiring 12-year-old Miguel Rivera wants to become a musician. However, his shoemaking family refuses such dreams and instead insists on letting him follow their long-standing work passed down for generations. Things become more complicated when he is cursed and journeys to the Land of the Dead with the help of his deceased relatives to fix the wrongs he has done.Coco does use a few familiar elements used in past Pixar films that I see them like ingredients used in making this particular movie:<ul><li>The aspiration of Ratatouille</li></ul><ul><li>A hint of Inside Out's concept </li></ul><ul><li>The emotional touch of Toy Story 3</li></ul>When blended with Mexican culture, music, and customs, including traditional beliefs for Mexico's holiday Dia de Los Muertos, it's a story worth telling when seeing it through Miguel's perspective as though we've grasped his inner psyche and are channeling it. And his meetings with various whimsical characters in the Land of the Dead offers an insight to what he's been missing and didn't know he had all along.Miguel's family felt so relatable that it's reminding me of members of my own family at a young age. Like I can literally see their personalities residing in these characters, especially kindhearted Mama Coco (who reminds me so much of my late grandmother) that it brought a tear to my eye and hushed weeping from some people that night. I'd say this feels relatable no matter who you are or where you're from because while a dream of being something greater is one thing, never forget that family is also equally important. The voice cast did an impressive job, especially newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel. Not a shred of doubt this flick will be noteworthy during award's season. This is a movie that can apply to any generation.To director Lee Unkrich and the rest at Pixar. Gracias.The moral: Cherish family. They may tell one to know their place, but it's not a crime to follow one's own path to something more life-fulfilling than initially given.",9,5,17,28 November 2017
Big Hero 6," Marvel-based Disney Movie Stands Its Ground
","Following from Disney's impressive box office wins that was left off with the phenomenon 'Frozen,' I was not exactly sure what I was in for, so I went to check it out with family. Since it's Disney's first animated superhero film, I expected it to reach the ranks of most recent successful superhero movies that have dazzled and graced the movie screens way before it. Upon leaving the theater, I was left bewildered and curious over it all. I know Big Hero 6's origins were initially from a Marvel comic, but the movie has proved that it can stand its ground as a Disney animated feature in its own right. With Disney's incredible winning streak of past Revival Era hits like 'Princess and the Frog,' 'Tangled,' 'Wreck-It Ralph,' and 'Frozen,' I have to say Big Hero 6 is no exception. As much as I've appreciated Frozen's characters and impressive songs, this movie is certainly NO musical of any kind. Instead, it has the potential to reach the ranks like 'Wreck-It Ralph' in terms of a legitimate, yet compassionate adventure story despite it feeling overshadowed by Frozen's currently popular fanbase.In a futuristic tech-based city aptly titled San Fransokyo, the story features 14-year-old prodigy Hiro Hamada with a knack in robotics that he graduated high school ahead of his peers. Hiro's life is forever and drastically changed when a mysterious masked figure threatens to use the boy's intellect for his own devious plot.It has an unusual, yet interesting formula: Disney humor, Marvel-induced action, and a touch of cyberpunk with dramatic themes that strikes an uncanny resemblance to Japanese Anime. The city's setting was well-detailed and finely assembled that it gave off the vibrant concept of 'What would happen if Tokyo ever did fully go cross-culture with San Francisco?' While 'Frozen' has the likable snowman Olaf, the scene stealer for this movie is inflatable nurse robot Baymax (done with impressive voice work by 30 Rock's Scott Adsit behind the controls) with a personality that displays innocence, but is further backed up by learning human traits around him. Actor Ryan Potter delivered well in voicing boy genius Hiro by balancing both scruffiness and intelligence into his character. That bond between Hiro and Baymax somewhat began to remind me of the one shared between Ralph and Vanellope in 'Wreck-It Ralph.' The character Yokai (though his name is not mentioned in the film) was a formidable villain who doesn't monologue and instead follows his objective in a swiftly manner.The younger ones who still can't fully comprehend the intensity of Marvel's most recent live-action movies will find this movie just as engaging, yet slightly watered-down and heartwarming at the same time. I know the original Big Hero 6 comic featured a mostly-Asian superhero team as opposed to the multi-ethnic team shown in the film adaptation, but I won't bother nitpicking over that. My true nitpicks, however, were that of Hiro's comrades since they weren't further explored enough in terms of their backstories, more chemistry from them towards Hiro, and the pacing felt a little rushed. However, to avoid spoilers, towards the end is something you yourself might not have guessed happening for one of them. Nevertheless, the entire movie demonstrates that you don't have to be an avid comic book fan (like Fred) to understand it completely, but what really matters is that this is an elaborate and entirely different take from the original source material and has made its mark successfully in Disney's current Revival Era with an amazing story and fast-paced action. I acknowledge the critics were right about this movie with its charms and charisma that I'm willing to see (if possible) another adventure in store for these heroes. Am I satisfied with my care? I certainly am...",9,11,31,11 November 2014
Brave," A Pixar Film That Barely Succeeds
","The moment I read the critic reviews about 'Brave,' I had to rush immediately to the local movie theater to watch and see what they saw. After watching every scene and the entire story unfold, I was actually impressed all the way to the end!So, it focuses on a rebellious princess named Merida that dreams to live her own life the way she wants it, rather than having to follow her family's royal, age-old traditions.As one critic stated in his review, it's reminiscent of Pixar's 2003 movie 'Finding Nemo.' Why? Because the thematic element of that movie focused on the bonding between a father and son, whereas 'Brave' focused on the complete opposite by focusing on the bonding between a mother and daughter. And I started to get that impression as well. Not to mention that it seems to have a cross of the thematic material of 'Finding Nemo' and (hint) a similar scenario of Disney's hand-drawn film 'Brother Bear.'Overall, I thought it was a Pixar film that greatly surpasses the 2011 critical disappointment of Cars 2. Although I'll admit the film's story felt rushed and could have expanded slightly more, it was legitimate enough and had some mature elements older kids could understand. Fellow 'Harry Potter' alums like Julie Walters, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane, did a fine job bringing their characters to life with such poise. But, I was in awe seeing and hearing a well-done acting performance by Scottish native/actress Kelly MacDonald (of Boardwalk Empire fame) voicing the lead Merida, and a first for Pixar Animation Studios to focus more on not just their first female lead or first fairy tale-theme, but leaning towards a darker tone compared to their previous lighthearted CG films. It's a welcoming addition to the Pixar Feature collection.",9,2,6,22 June 2012
Jurassic World," Caution: Park Has Reopened!
","First off, it's hard to imagine that it's been twenty-two years since Michael Crichton's original novel Jurassic Park leapt from its fine pages and graced cinema screens under Steven Spielberg's direction to a wide array of audiences with breathtaking visuals and a plot that provided a theory on how science can be both groundbreaking and seriously flawed at the same time.In this sequel, over two decades have passed since the incident on Isla Nublar's Jurassic Park and it would seem founder John Hammond's legacy continues to live on with the reopening of the park now in full swing as 'Jurassic World' with tourists from all over the world visiting to see real-live dinosaurs. However, the follies of human beings still loom upon introducing the first hybrid dinosaur that may as well outrank the park's once signature T-Rex.'Guardians of the Galaxy' star, Chris Pratt plays rational Velociraptor tamer Owen Grady as he must deal with the goings-on behind the scenes of the now vast expansion of the park. It's like his character basically borrows the Dino-savvy traits of Sam Neill's Dr. Alan Grant and the survival instincts of Bob Peck's Game Warden Robert Muldoon. Whereas, Bryce Dallas Howard as park operations manager Claire Dearing is a typical portrayal of a hard-working individual who hardly has a life outside of her work (like watching her own nephews venturing in the park). As both characters must work together, they must also stop corrupt individuals who secretly plot to use the dinosaurs for their own personal gain, which I found obvious the moment they spoke about these creatures' capabilities. Claire's nephews Zach and Gray - played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins respectively - loosely mirror the original siblings Lex and Tim Murphy, who are inadvertently thrown into this perilous adventure when attacked by the hybrid dinosaur.The entire plot and theme does feel very similar to its 1993 predecessor - thus tending to make some pivotal scenes predictable - in terms of the consequences in corporate greed and how our most greatest creations can also meet our darkest fears. But I'd say it works out fine by introducing this to an entirely new generation who were too young or weren't even born to witness what the film series had done years prior. With enough action, suspense, and Pratt's occasional humor, it does not distract from the movie's pacing.I was disappointed none of the human characters from the past movies ever returned to reprise their roles (save for B.D. Wong's reprisal of Dr. Henry Wu), but I understand what new director Colin Trevorrow meant by 'shoehorning them into the exact same predicament' over and over again without a proper reason. For the casual film-goer, it's a delight to see how much has been offered whether you're nostalgic or a newcomer. I felt relieved that this movie sequel didn't stray into B-Movie territory as 2001's Jurassic Park III and instead greatly one-ups it with a better plot and depth. The visual effects certainly have advanced these days since I noticed some usage of motion-capture in a few scenes. It's impressive the film crew didn't rely too heavily on often-used CGI effects, but the subtle use of animatronics and 'suitmation' as well. Although not really groundbreaking at all as the first movie, it nevertheless had a vibrant new cast and I loved that some scenes in the movie paid tribute or an homage to Steven Spielberg's 1993 original with flying colors. I'm glad these filmmakers never forgot those roots and kept them intact to acknowledge its presence. With the accompanying music score of Michael Giacchino (standing in for original composer John Williams), it gives a nice touch to what Jurassic Park's opening theme was known well for. My thoughts, it's a sequel that stands proudly as the majestic T-Rex once did in its prehistorical era.",9,18,45,13 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Visual Spectacle Well-Balanced with Story
","As Marvel continues to dominate the movie industry and box office, their latest outing 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' certainly one-ups its 2012 predecessor with new heroes, allies, and a formidable foe that makes previous villain Loki look like a tamed kitten. Since this movie marks the end of Joss Whedon's directorial position for Marvel, he pulled off such an amazing move by making the original film's light-hearted moments turn a little darker, but never straying completely away from character development and nothing short of more screen time for each. It's like, Whedon wasn't trying to make everything from the last movie better with more destruction or mayhem, along with the appearance of new characters without proper explanation (he's not Michael Bay), instead he balanced those out evenly with better depth story-wise.When a rogue AI known as Ultron (voiced by Blacklist's James Spader) declares extinction on humanity in order to bring peace to the world, the Avengers must reunite to stop this new threat as it threatens other parts of the world, along the way fighting their own battles inside and out.I was blown away with the original Avengers movie, and its sequel doesn't disappoint as I was literally at the edge of my seat. Unlike the previous film, this now gives Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye even more development into what he can really do on screen, complete with clever one-liners and stylized action sequences alongside his fellow co-stars. Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow had some light shed onto her backstory, which doesn't distract from the business at hand, only an insight into emotional depth (including her fellow allies). Robert Downey Jr. still has his wits portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man when mingling with anyone around him, while new faces Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch proved to be quite the brother-sister team (done strikingly well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth 'Liz' Olsen respectively). Now as for the titular character himself Ultron, James Spader basically shaped the character with an ominous, cunning tone crossed with wittiness that could make anyone shake in fear or have a tendency to laugh when in his presence. Which is kind of rare in past Marvel villains. The accompanying underscore of both Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman - in place of original composer Alan Silvestri - made the action sequences and scenarios look and sound more suspenseful, breathtaking, and epic to every degree. In the end, each hero that fought admirably left behind amazing twists and tragedies I did not see coming (though I won't spoil it there). In fact, I feel the need to watch it again for some reason.My thoughts: Admittedly, a few loose ends needed to be cleared up since it causes the main story to feel pretty vague to understand when connecting them with a few notable subplots, but for a second round of Marvel movie crossover, Joss Whedon assembled what appears to be yet another superb entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",9,2,7,24 April 2015
Selma," Captivating Portrayal of the Civil Rights Leader and Intensely Moving Story
","The words I best describe this movie are 'profound' and 'intense.' From what I've learned since my school days, equal rights among race was a very touchy subject when it came to American history.David Oyelowo's portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. was so spot-on that I was immediately drawn in to see every detail of the film play out. I was disturbed and further curious at the same time amongst every scene that unfolded during the key moments of the film.Basically, it featured how much King sacrificed and went through in the 1960s to maintain blacks rights to vote and eliminate segregation from all states. I couldn't believe how much violent injustice and racial discrimination were used to intimidate innocent people who were trying to have the same rights like many in America.Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr, and rapper-actor Common brought out great performances as the individuals who stood up for what they truly believe in and they wouldn't let hate stand in their way. Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson was rather physically uncanny and his scenes brought out the angst of what he had to face at a time when violence was further escalating during the Civil Rights Movement. Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace made me feel to hate the man for his segregationist beliefs, but when confronted by President Johnson himself, it just got real.The juxtaposition of real-life archive footage in the movie gave a nice touch to how very genuine these people of Selma endured plenty of horrible confrontations. Whether these usually ended in violence or even death, they just kept growing in numbers and overcome all who stood against their true beliefs in racial equality.My only nitpick was that of President Johnson's confrontations with Martin Luther King himself. I've learned in the history books that they've had their fair share of disagreements, but nothing this intense as shown on screen. Nevertheless, it proved that being an American President was no easy feat at a very difficult time. Overall, this is a film that didn't require lengthy (moving) MLK speeches, instead it focused on tense confrontations black people had to endure and how one individual stood tall and fought back not with violence, but with powerful words and strong beliefs. I applaud David Oyelowo and director Ava DuVernay for providing a glimpse into how racism was overcome by one profound man whose legacy still reverberates to this day.",9,38,63,23 January 2015
Rio," Underrated, But Blue Sky Delivers and Soars Into New Territory!
","I have many things to talk about regarding 'Rio,' and I think I know what's best to say in two words: Brilliant execution.Now for the movie itself, the plot of bringing a domesticated bird from America back to his native hometown in Brazil to preserve its species was not what I expected at first, but now I'm completely mesmerized by how we got to know the interesting human and animal characters, the amazing Brazilian setting, and a couple music numbers with South American samba flair.The voice actors were chosen well, Oscar nominees Jesse Eisenberg (voicing male Macaw Blu) and especially Anne Hathaway (voicing female Macaw Jewel) brilliantly proving that she has the vocals to pull off a stunning music performance. Most might have heard her demonstrate her singing talent at the Academy Awards, but this movie is living proof that acting is not the only thing she's good at anymore.After watching this movie for the first time in theaters and then seeing it again on its DVD release, Blue Sky has demonstrated that they can divert themselves away from their 'Ice Age' franchise from time to time and deliver a marvelous new story filled with joy, sympathy, and quirks you can't help but follow along. Director Carlos Saldanha has given us a dose of what his hometown in Brazil is like and its tranquility (via CGI) is very engaging. Their research was done really well and hoping to see more of this again and again. For a non-Disney film, I'm giving Blue Sky a chance and saying that their team has pulled off - which perhaps looks like - THE BIRTH OF A NEW FRANCHISE!",10,0,0,14 August 2011
Les Misérables," A Powerful Musical with A Stellar Cast
","As someone who usually strays completely away from musical films, I stepped into the local Las Vegas movie theater on opening day to witness what makes this movie rise on a grand scale from its original stage production. When I did, the songs were incredible and the story was filled with drama, suspense, and humorous moments provided by funny guy Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (reunited since the 2007 musical Sweeney Todd).The story about recently-released prisoner Jean Valjean restarting his life anew in 1815 France, only to encounter various people along the way that affects him and those people greatly as years progress. The most notable person he comes across is the virtuous Fantine who tells him to find her daughter Cosette and care for her as her final dying wish. Jean raises her, but things become more complicated as rebels in France begin a revolution causing unrest. At the same time love, trust, and betrayal roll in as well.With so much to say about 2012's Les Miserables, I find this an exceptional musical. The time and setting usually doesn't sit well with me, but none of it mattered when I kept my eyes and ears open to the cast themselves. Hugh Jackman delivered such a radiant performance as lead character Jean Valjean. Anne Hathaway was superb in belting out her rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' while Russell Crowe's portrayal of Jean's pursuer Javert was done incredibly well with own singing performance. Samantha Barks did splendidly well as Eponine as the love rival to Amanda Seyfried's Cosette for Eddie Redmayne's Marius. But I say that the real show stealers goes to the kids themselves. Daniel Huttlestone had spunk and wittiness as young rebel boy Gavroche and Isabelle Allen's portrayal of young Cosette was pretty spot-on. Her singing displayed innocence and a longing to be loved. These kids really captured my attention!I can now see why musical films are usually not looked upon widely by some avid filmgoers, but they have no idea what they're missing if they don't catch it. With Anne Hathaway's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress and the riveting performance of the songs 'Suddenly' and 'Do You Hear the People Sing?' were quite phenomenal. A nod to the original production of Les Mis is seen in the local church's Bishop (played by Colm Wilkinson) at the beginning of the film, which is a nice touch. I was clearly sold when it all ended. By far, the best of director Tom Hooper's work.",10,1,2,27 December 2014
Zombieland," For A Zombie Film: It Follows 'Shaun' Roots
","As what some critics have stated, it's like 'Shaun of the Dead' meets 'Superbad' and I have to say that I agree with them on that point! I thought the 2004 British film with Simon Pegg (the inspiration for this film) was hilarious and scary at the same time, but 'Zombieland' wouldn't have been worth watching unless you added stars like Woody Harrelson and the underrated Jesse Eisenberg into the mix! As the story goes, the world has been ravaged by flesh-hungry zombies and a small group of survivors must join forces in staying alive and fending off the horrific creatures (albeit in many humorous methods you yourself might think of).I'll admit that some scenes did seem contrived and could have improved on learning more about each character's past exploits, but director Ruben Fleischer managed to come up with a clever idea of blending the typical zombie film with elements of teenage angst. One scene I remember, for example, was when Columbus (Eisenberg) claimed how he scored with this one girl he made up, but the audience would know well he's hopeless on romantic confrontations. This hences the 'Superbad' reference. As a whole, the movie was pretty much more of a laugh fest than something to fear.",9,3,7,26 September 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A Film NOT Disappointing At All
","Critics and some average people alike always judge before they actually see an entire movie, but they are just blind to see how this cinematic masterpiece Michael Bay can put together. Bay certainly caught my attention and this sequel to the 2007 live-action adaptation of 'Transformers' is no exception.Familiar characters old and new, new storyline, and better character development are what really makes this sequel become a movie worth staying in your seats.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college, yet he is not aware that the battle he faced before is far from over. When new Decepticons come rolling in, it's up to him, his human allies, and Autobots to put an end to their tyranny.With its stylized action sequences, impressive visual effects, awesome voice actors, and amazing filming locations, Michael Bay has done it again! I'll admit that one of his films in the past was a dud and that very few particular scenes in this movie were not necessary, but Transformers is what defined Bay's directing much further. He should keep up with his signature explosions, that's his edge.",10,25,47,21 June 2009
Steve Jobs," A Glimpse Into An Enigmatic Visionary
","Academy Award-winning director Danny Boyle's (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours) follow up that looks into the late, iconic Apple co-founder's struggles onstage and offstage was certainly a difficult one to comprehend. The moment the first scene began, I was filled with curiosity on what exactly was Jobs' problem when balancing both his prodigious work and personal life simultaneously.The plot centers around Jobs' introduction of the Apple I computer back in 1984 to the debut of the iMac in 1998. But during that era - in spite of his vision of allowing the public to experience computer usage in a different way - his personal troubles behind-the-scenes involving family made him a complicated man with his several imperfections.I'm aware of the 2013 take that starred Ashton Kutcher, but comparing that movie to this one, I'd say this version glimpses into the more darker, complex personality that is Steve Jobs rather than inconclusive facts and juvenile scriptwriting. Michael Fassbender's portrayal is physically uncanny as the leading man. Whereas his costar Seth Rogen as fellow co-founder and friend Steve Wozniak seems to have grasped his inner dramatic side (quite a shift from his comedic work) by showing how much Wozniak went through to help make his and Jobs' vision a reality. Although the film is all about Steve Jobs and his varying tribulations to success, I'd say the real hero is his daughter Lisa. She's basically his rock. As years progressed and she had gotten older, Lisa knew deep down that even if he repeatedly denied in public that she is not his daughter (when a DNA test said otherwise), he cares about her even when he doesn't openly show it. I'm sure award nominations will certainly not be ruled out based on these actors' performance. The movie does tend to slow down in some parts revolving around Jobs' ousting from Apple and eventual reinstated status. With the help of 'Social Network' screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, both he and Danny Boyle's combined efforts into creating a movie that displays a near-spiteful, yet astute glimpse into how much Jobs sacrificed and changed the outlook of many computer users. Whether you're an Apple follower or not, this isn't a movie that overglorifies Jobs as a profound intellectual that can do no wrong and overshadows all his rivals easy. No. Instead he is more of an enigmatic visionary with a complicated, yet conscientious life whose legacy reverberates in the company millions around the world have come to know. All great visionaries struggled to get where they needed to be and Steve Jobs is no exception.",8,2,4,29 October 2015
Sausage Party," An Adequate R-rated, Vulgar, CGI Comedy
","Realizing this is the first full-length, CGI animated R-rated flick, I just had to see it for myself. Since Seth Rogen and his crew admitted this movie is an intentional spoof of Pixar and DreamWorks films, it left me further curious on what was to expect. When it ended, I thought to myself, 'Past animated movies went the R-rated route before, so is this a step further?'The story revolves around Frank (Seth Rogen), a sausage along with his friends wanting to be chosen by human shoppers or as the foods call them 'gods' to find a new life in what they call home. Though it's not all what it seems when they find out the horrific truth of their fates, so he and his fellow foods must band together to follow their own destinies.The concept of personifying inanimate objects is something that existed many times before, but by giving it the R-rated treatment, there's no holding back with sexual content and foul language. My nitpicks of it were the lack of proper depth in the human characters (save for the druggie) and the excessive cursing just to be funny wears thin easily after a while, though the food puns sure had me laughing especially its shock value in the various predicaments each of the food characters face (albeit forced and a tendency to be predictable that I sometimes turned away out of embarrassment).In the past, I've watched a handful of R-rated animated films of different genres whether of domestic or overseas origin (some of which were milestone pieces that broke ground or shaped the medium much differently compared to the ones for younger audiences), but marking the first CGI-animated in this category is something that's not often done. Story-wise, it toys with themes of existentialism, religion and even reality-bending material. Among the various Seth Rogen comedies I've seen ('Paul' still one personal favorite), it's like 'This Is The End: Food Edition.' With the voices of Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and other Judd Apatow regulars, they sure sounded like they had a riot lending their voices to these characters on screen, not to mention the irony of involving Disney veteran Alan Menken composing the music and the opening number. On another note, it's like it's trying to follow in the footsteps of the last R-rated, animated box office success that was South Park back in 1999 (which coincidentally parodied Disney animated musicals of the 90s). Although it wouldn't be fair to compare Rogen's brand of humor to Trey & Matt's South Park, I'd say it's wanting to reach similar ranks in terms of violent, vulgar humor if not exactly high standard. This is a rarity in this current era of CGI animation, check it out and don't expect your kids to watch it anytime soon since it's obviously not for them.",8,9,18,26 August 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Surprisingly Entertaining Illumination Flick
","Ever since the release of Despicable Me back in 2010, Illumination has really stepped up from their previous animated movies. Whether it be the aforementioned film, its sequel, its spin-off Minions, or the 2012 adaptation of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, it was quite a change with their latest entry The Secret Life of Pets.The plot centers around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier living happily with his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in New York City, but when she adopts a bigger dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) to live with them, Max is overwhelmed by his new roommate. The two opposing dogs must then work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the big city.For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love interest Gidget, and 'Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke. With quick-witted, slapstick humor that feels reminiscent of Looney Tunes (even with a tendency to adlib lines in some scenes), the real scene stealer among this talented cast goes to comedian Kevin Hart voicing adorable, yet antagonistic rabbit Snowball.While the littler ones will be kept engaged and entertained by the humorous animal characters as well as the obstacles they come across, to me personally the story feels rushed, especially the need for a little more emotional depth and better character development. I know there's a lot more to offer in this story's universe, so a sequel can't be far behind from this underrated animated flick. Nevertheless, it certainly kept me laughing nearly throughout the movie's 90-minute run time and it's something that shouldn't be taken for granted. I enjoyed it.",9,34,55,3 August 2016
Finding Dory," A Rare Pixar Sequel That Can Be Emotionally Riveting
","In the past, Pixar movies I've come to know as a kid since the 90s have introduced many funny and versatile characters going on the most riveting adventures. Now, Pixar has produced a sequel that may possibly be worthy of reaching the same ranks as the successful Toy Story film series. 2003's Finding Nemo spin-off sequel 'Finding Dory' is a movie that can reach an impactful emotional tone in its own right.The story takes place about one year after blue tang fish Dory helped clownfish Marlin search for his son Nemo. She now lives with the clownfish family, but feels she needs to piece together the whereabouts of her own long-lost family. As before, it's a desperate search which this time ultimately leads them to another side of the Pacific, a marine life aquarium in Monterrey, California.Admittedly, when I first heard the title, I began to sneer at such an idea since the studio's last two sequel/prequel efforts like Cars 2 was disastrous in terms of story. Whereas Monsters University was pretty average. Thus making me think 'what gives them the idea this sequel will be any different?' Of course, when I first watched 'Dory,' it was something I found just as emotionally driven if certainly not better than its 2003 predecessor. I feel it is something as poised as Pixar's recent Oscar-winning hit Inside Out, namely on its importance of family. There were times in the movie where I felt lost and had some predictable scenarios as well, but this felt more than just a sequel where they throw in new characters or settings, it's the issue of how one can comprehend loss or separation, especially if the individual has an impairment in short-term memory at a very young age. Ellen DeGeneres gracefully reprises the role as forgetful fish Dory with such believability in making her look vulnerable and helpless with such a condition. With Marlin and Nemo tagging along for the ride, they are assisted by their de facto guide Hank (voiced well by 'Modern Family' star Ed O'Neill), an anxious octopus (or 'heptapus' as Dory humorously calls him regarding missing a tentacle) wanting to escape to Cleveland as she continues her search around the aquarium. What gave a nice touch to the whole movie was actress Sigourney Weaver serving as the aquarium's hostess (similar to what she did for Pixar's Wall-E) and especially highlighting how Dory's personal journey clumsily, yet fatefully intertwined with Marlin's own journey when they first met in the 2003 original. Pixar easter eggs are also worth pondering over in various parts of the movie, too.This is more than just a 'kid's movie' and I emphasize on that. I would recommend this to adults with children of their own to see that because Dory has an impairment, she is easily misunderstood by many. But that doesn't mean it should be taken for granted. Instead, it's more about the values and what longing to be with a family truly feels like after so long.",8,2,11,27 June 2016
Straight Outta Compton," A Stunning Glimpse Into N.W.A.'s Tribulations and Legacy
","Ever since I can remember on Universal's 2002 semi-biopic 8 Mile, regarding how Eminem came to be (albeit name changed and loosely based on his life), I expected Straight Outta Compton was going to follow in that same fray. The moment the film began and completed it from start to finish, I was left bewildered and further curious on how much N.W.A. went through in the early 1990s, much like how Eminem wanted recognition in his skill despite his appearance and background. I may have been too young to understand what was going on in that era, but it piqued my interest even further since such harsh circumstances still reverberate in today's culture.The cast was profound. Jason Mitchell's take on the late Eazy-E was so spot-on and performed solidly as the one who basically held N.W.A. together. O'Shea Jackson Jr. does bear a striking resemblance of his own father Ice Cube and convincingly portrayed. While Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre certainly brought out the dramatic tension he faced when it came to confronting Death Row Records owner Suge Knight. And even Paul Giamatti's Jerry Heller - whom at one point had put their careers on the map until his methods were questioned altogether - felt suitable for Giamatti's skill in drama. For example, that one scene where Ice Cube leaves the group when he finds out about the contract deal the group would face individually when signed, I can already foresee what would immediately follow from there: diss tapes and retaliation (which was a big deal in the prime of the 90s).The entire film does live up to its namesake because it was all about five individuals whose lives weren't the best in the ghetto areas of Compton, yet their combined talents in writing music and shameless ways of expressing their lives in song really shook up the music industry, notably their hit song 'F*** tha Police' which got them into serious law trouble during one stage performance. The Rodney King beating, L.A. Riots, and even the tragic loss of member Eazy-E greatly affected them, but despite the tribulations overtime, they certainly left a mark on hip-hop/rap culture that continues to influence newcomers in the business years later. Director F. Gary Gray (Friday) definitely provided a stunning glimpse into these mens' lives and I applaud him and the cast for showing how the hood is not entirely all what is believed. Surviving police brutality and racial injustice were just of the few problems they've endured. Among the many reviews I've read nitpicking how it's so 'offensive' or 'noisy' and this is actually 'erotic porn' because of the gratuitous sex/nudity, pervasive language, and violence, the old-timers who despise such music seriously underestimate this movie without seeing what is trying to be accomplished here. Sure, they're nowhere perfect or classy (in the best sense), let alone heroes. But deep down it's expressed from the heart and a must-see for music enthusiasts of the old and new generation.",9,20,59,16 August 2015
Black Panther," Glimpse Into Wakanda. Left In Awe
","I'm at a loss for words that I can't even phrase them out carefully.While the story may somewhat fall short (it does share a few parallels to 'The Lion King' when observed carefully), it makes up for it with an interesting cast performance done by Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and Letitia Wright, the visual setting also feels so immersive you'd think you're actually there. Notably, Freeman's character Everett Ross began to slowly remind me of Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, but toned down in a different approach for humor. Not to mention the blend of traditional tribal music and an appealing soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar compliments both dramatic and intense scenes respectively.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'challa (Boseman) is chosen to succeed his late father by naming himself as King of Wakanda. Things drastically change when old wounds open from his father's past.After seeing Marvel's previous outing Thor: Ragnarok months back (which relied so much on a comedic approach), Black Panther is definitely a solo film that can hold its own with less humor and its blend of intricate action and drama. I mean based on the flashbacks and despite the intentions T'challa and Killmonger (Jordan) each had for the good of Wakanda, I couldn't help but pity their own respective causes. The former has his ideals and is about being virtuous by working hand-in-hand with their outside allies. Whereas the latter's intentions are morally unjust due to his own troubled past. It's completely understandable but for the wrong reasons.I will say that it's not entirely perfect, but it was more than enough to keep me enthralled at what Black Panther can do.",8,5,23,19 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," This Is Where You Want to Be
","A few friends I know spoke widely of The Greatest Showman and even told me to see it for myself, but I was not at all willing to go see it. However, all of that changed for the better when I did and found out a few songs were mesmerizing and enchanting enough to hear. Hugh Jackman really kicked it up with another impressive musical performance following from 2012's Les Miserables now as ringmaster P.T. Barnum.In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, Phineas Taylor Barnum grew up with barely anything as a young boy, but when he found love in a young girl from a rich family who openly despised him over his impoverish background and then proposes to her as they got older, he decides to show the world what more he can do by finding unique people and performers to put on a show for all to enjoy.The amazing cast that also included Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams were also a plus for this movie (glad to see and hear Efron return to his singing roots since his High School Musical days). And the plot? Explaining how the duo Barnum & Bailey came to be as circus founders in musical form was something I didn't expect. I think the true breakout in the cast is Keala Settle as the Bearded Lady with her song 'This Is Me.' True, there were some historical inaccuracies, name changes, and not meant to be entirely on point with the circus' true humble beginnings, but I'll bet this was the film crew's way of keeping the story moving with its moments of romance, drama, conflict, and deception. Despite Barnum facing so much criticism from the brutality of locals who were either discriminatory toward his circus troupe or resentful of who he is in general, he went and proved them wrong that he had a knack for making his hard work a reality, no matter who he and his troupe were.Newcomer director Michael Gracey did an exceptional job and a remarkable soundtrack (namely 'Rewrite the Stars' performed by Zac Efron and Zendaya is also a catchy tune). Some songs still play inside my head whenever I think of this movie. I have no regrets. I enjoyed plenty.",9,1,1,24 January 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Pondering Into the Disney Legacy
","Following three years since its release, I can't help but express how thought-provoking Saving Mr. Banks turned out since the day I first watched it on opening night. The 1960s became one of the last prominent moments in Uncle Walt's lifetime that he witnessed before he passed away, but it's really about how one movie almost never came to be. About how the Mouse met the Magical Nanny.The story follows P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), the renowned author of the Mary Poppins books. In 1961, when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) asks for her to fly to America to meet her personally about his film adaptation of her book, she reluctantly accepts to meeting him. Despite her tragic and bitter past life that greatly dictated her present self, Travers learns from Walt's experience that it doesn't have to be that way and what really matters is letting go and keep moving forward.Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) definitely showed the tribulations and conflicts Travers had when overseeing the production of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins adaptation. It may have gotten off to a troubling start with her not being open to how each character in her book should be portrayed as well as showing disdain on a few songs, even the animation that Walt wanted to include, but upon seeing the progress of where the direction was going, there were signs that she was beginning to warm up to it. I loved how a few scenes began to jump ahead back and forth on a recurring basis between glimpses of her childhood and then into how that reflected onto her books.Tom Hanks' take on Walt was pretty uncanny in how he segued into sounding like him and Emma Thompson's portrayal as P.L. Travers showed angst and bittersweetness, yet is misunderstood as a troubled individual that had a rough childhood. I was also left in awe on how in one scene Disneyland was shown as it once looked in the 60s. Looked pretty nifty as though you've traveled back in time. Overall, it's a dramatic and tense element deep beneath the inner workings of light-hearted Disney.",8,1,1,18 December 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," David Yates Conjures A Magnificent End to A Renowned Book/Film Series
","Since 2001, I've watched every Harry Potter film ever made. Now here's something that can be difficult to put in proper words. I'm just... in complete shock and have to say that it's an astounding and compelling end to a famous franchise! The top film critics were absolutely right about it all. The series started off as a lighthearted piece where we got to know the young cast, but as the movies progressed further into a darker tone (with 'Prisoner of Azkaban' director Alfonso Cuaron starting it there), we see this cast growing up before our eyes, delivering such wonderful performances. It was certainly not overacting, director David Yates turned it all around with such finesse ever since he took control of 2007's 'Order of the Phoenix.' The final duel of Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort has finally arrived and I was at the edge of my seat anxiously waiting to see the end result (I could literally hear some people gasping, slowly cheering, and even a small handful of them tearing up).I've read the original book of 'Deathly Hallows' and there were quite a few changes that occurred in the movie (though I won't say what those are). Point here is, it's very intricate to interpret this particular book into film, but at least this adaptation kept as closely as it can to the original. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have permanently solidified their careers, thanks to the franchise that has shaped them as we see today!With great robustness in the story both in triumph and tragedy, author JK Rowling certainly brought us to our knees begging to see more.",10,1,2,17 July 2011
Incredibles 2," 14 Years Later: Incredibles Has Matured in Content with Impressive Results
","Things have changed greatly since the lighthearted 2004 Pixar hit The Incredibles. In this 2018 sequel, it feels more darker in content - like on the boundary line of PG to PG-13 - compared to its predecessor. See, unlike the original which played on the superhero genre of the early 2000s with sitcom-like humor, this feels like a blend of the current decade's juggernaut of ever-growing superhero movies with some maturity in these characters we've come to know those years ago.A few months have passed after Syndrome's defeat and the Parr Family have moved on with their lives as though nothing's happened. When a wealthy tycoon offers to bring Supers back into the spotlight, he asks Bob Parr's (aka Mr. Incredible) wife Helen (aka Elastigirl) to be the front in making it happen again, resulting in a new villain called the Screenslaver to wreak havoc.Compared to past Pixar films that spawned sequels (or a prequel) of their own, director Brad Bird did an impressive job by having these characters retain their sitcom-like quirks, but also including some character development that wasn't explored before. This is a sequel that was long overdue to be released years back and it was worth quite the wait (especially for the kids of 2004 who are now young adults in or out of college). The returning voice cast and the new cast members did splendidly well with their roles and the real scene-stealer has to go to both baby Jack-Jack and Edna. I wasn't bored in the least, it's a pretty good follow-up.",8,3,5,26 June 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," Danny Boyle's Work: Captivating and Motivating
","When I first heard of this movie back when it was still new to theaters, it was thanks to my film professor at my local university that introduced it to me. After witnessing the entire story unfold, it felt so uplifting and provided an insight on India's slums. Stars Dev Patel (in his breakout film role) and Frieda Pinto certainly gave splendid performances as characters Jamal and Latika respectively. After watching director Danny Boyle's previous movie 28 Days Later, this is quite a transition from one genre to another. What both the latter and this movie have in common is that it aims towards main characters who are trying to find a purpose for themselves on their imperfect lives, but not without getting thrown into conflict with people they remain unsure if they should trust them or not, thus shaping their lives in various ways.As the story goes, an impoverished individual named Jamal who pretty much grew up in the slums of India with his older brother Salim tries to make a living in surviving any means necessary, even if it means tangling with the wrong crowd. Despite the hardships, betrayal, and the various conflicts along the way, Jamal tries to make something for himself by entering into the game show 'Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?'Observing the technical portions, I liked how well the film editing tells the story through Jamal's perspective and that the past experiences he went through lead up to the present time back and forth frequently, which helped him achieve the answers he seeks during the game. It's basically fate telling the story through the questions he is given by the host. For it to win eight Oscars that year, I can already see what makes it so significant. The music and underscore of composer A.R. Rahman also had me so immersed into the dramatic settings of the film that I was entranced by how well it accompanied tense situations and enlightened moments. After looking back at this movie several years later, it's certainly not overrated, it is indeed written.",10,0,2,28 September 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," For A Michael Bay Film: Just Reached Mayhem to the Max!
","Michael Bay just brought 'destruction' and 'mayhem' to a whole new level compared to his past movies! It definitely blows the previous 'Transformers' films he's done right into the stratosphere! With Shia LaBeouf back once more as protagonist Sam Witwicky, looks like his reputation as an A-list actor just got brighter (no way LaBeouf will work cheap so easily now) With Bay's constant signature explosions, continuous robot brawls, few comedic moments (most notably Ken Jeong delivering a few of his somewhat obvious, toned down 'Hangover' shtick), and various acts of betrayal and cunningness, Bay has just made his formula go unstable (in a good way)! I needed some time to make sense of all that madness and this movie reduces 'Revenge of the Fallen' to ashes.Megan Fox's replacement (newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't quite fill in the void she left behind (because Fox was a little more active and a headstrong female figure than what Rosie could possibly pull), the script could have improved by a tiny percentile, and the acting needed several tweaks, but in the wake of every destruction on-screen, my adrenaline just kept growing higher. What caught my attention above all was seeing factual U.S. historical moments crossed over with the fictional storyline. It was amazing on how the filmmakers can make these intertwine. Hasn't changed one bit since 'Forrest Gump.' Thanks to minimal support of 3D from fellow director James Cameron, Cameron and Bay just made the film work out. A must-see!",9,1,4,8 July 2011
Sully," Intricate Glimpse Into Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger
","I've heard this airline captain's story through the news back in 2009 during one of my college classes at the time, but had no idea a film based on those events was created. Upon watching every minute of it, I'm now able to see what made Captain Sullenberger a hero to his passengers and those who know him personally.The plot revolves around his heroic efforts as he and his First Officer Jeffrey Skiles navigated their US Airways plane right into the Hudson River as a last ditch of effort after their plane had collided with Canadian Geese that flew right into the plane's engines. Despite such actions that saved their lives, there was also debate on the circumstance on what could've happened or what would've been better than Sully himself had explained.Tom Hanks' portrayal of the renowned captain was a pretty impressive performance. Instead of just merely trying to emulate the real-life airline captain's experiences on screen, he managed to capture the angst and personal struggles Sully had faced following from that traumatic event. The board hearing scenes had so much to talk about that it left me further curious on what made these events run into motion. For example, when using flight simulators as to project what happened that day and combining it with Sully's recollections via PTSD visions, it's like placing ourselves into his shoes step-by-step. Director Clint Eastwood followed up well from his previous Oscar-nominated film American Sniper by cranking out a story that focuses on how one man who doesn't see himself as a glorified hero, but a man who did anything a professional pilot would do by taking such incredible risks to save the lives of himself and those aboard. For a biographical drama that touches on the mystery and intrigue, this is a must-watch and is sure to hit various accolades.",8,0,1,3 October 2016
Furious 7," A Gripping, High-Octane Thrill Ride!
","Since 2001, The Fast and the Furious was indeed, by far, the most interesting film that defined street racing in popular culture. Now, jumping ahead over a decade later with this new movie Furious 7, it did more than just provide the usual car chases, extremely dangerous stunts, or intricate strategies the last films had shown many times before, it also brought out something more that is seldom seen in the entire film series: emotional depth.Following from where both Tokyo Drift and Fast 6 left off, Dominic Toretto and his crew head out to pursue the mysterious individual responsible for killing one of their own. Upon finding this person, they realize there's more about him than what they initially thought.With the departure of director Justin Lin (who helmed the previous four films) and upon passing his director's chair to horror filmmaker James Wan (of 'Saw' and 'Insidious' fame), he did quite an impressive job doing an action film, which diverts him from his usual norm, and that's not a bad thing. Normally, I watch the movies for its plot, but story-wise, it kept me further interested that I was left mind-blown and found it made perfect sense on how the previous events from the main films and its one spin-off intertwine with this current title. The action sequences were brilliantly executed and crafted cleverly within the new location settings like Abu Dhabi, especially when it further showcased how much a car can do than just simply driving or speeding in one. As car makes and models continue to evolve overtime, you'd know how useful they can be in such scenarios when you least expect it.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, The Rock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Tyrese, and Michelle Rodriguez have really outdone themselves in this new outing, including additional cast member Jason Statham - who's no stranger to fast cars himself - as the villain, but of course the real honor goes to Walker. After his tragic passing during production of this movie, I felt this similar notion of loss when Brandon Lee lost his own life during filming of The Crow back in 1993. It's like when you see them perform on screen, you feel like they're still very much alive as long as people continue to watch what they loved doing. Jumping back to this film and to not give too much away, some scenes actually brought out an emotional tone for a few of the main characters. Although most of the crew would still continue doing the meticulous work they're known well for, there are moments where they express (if not verbally) good reasons for doing such. Overall, it's a film Walker did proudly and it was great seeing Lucas Black reprise his role of Sean Boswell from Tokyo Drift again since it basically helped set the stage for what Toretto's crew must do next. Though some audiences may call it 'overhyped,' 'predictable,' 'mediocre,' or even 'overly sympathetic' due to the passing of a great actor, never once should it be taken for granted because I certainly enjoyed what I saw as the adrenaline in me kept pumping and the story didn't drag, only accelerated further. There wasn't a dry eye in the auditorium that night since I literally heard scattered, faint weeping and sobbing. Not to mention a touch of symbolism in one scene that made it so emotional. Thanks for the ride, Paul. My hat's off to you...",10,2,8,3 April 2015
