United 93," Evoked the same tension and emotions as the actual event itself
","Paul Greengrass has adequately captured the fear, the anxiety, the tension and emotions of that tragic day. I say, 'thoroughly' because I felt very involved, like I was living it with the victims. This movie was detailed enough to provide the average viewer all of the unknown information that was overshadowed by the barrage of media regarding the events that related to the World Trade Center Towers, not to minimize the heartbreak of that particular location. Paul Greengrass would have done a much better job than Oliver Stone, in telling the actual story regarding the Towers, because United 93 captures the true heartache and emotion of September 11, without exploiting the victims pain.If one is looking for any heroism in these tragic event, Pual Greengrass has done the job tastefully, and sensitively in the telling of United 93. There is no doubt in my mind that he would have done just as well, if not better, in the sensitive retelling of the story about the Towers.United 93 was so moving that one didn't take the time to analyze it, as one had the time to do with World Trade Center, since the World Trade Center moved slow enough to be scrutinized but United 93 doesn't pause long enough to give you a chance to scrutinize or judge the story, from a viewers perspective. Bravo Mr. Greengrass! A movie very tactfully done!",9,1,3,24 December 2006
The Last Legion," Wonderful storyline, great epic
","I enjoyed the storyline, and noticed how beautifully it was presented, when she joined him in his bed; nothing shown but a lot said. I seen a tactfully presented great drama, amazing screenplay, great visual and sound effects, with long-forgotten spiritual messages and a score of other kind accolades, is what I would have to say about this movie. A terrific movie! Very well done! I collect only that which I can enjoy for years to come, and I am now going to purchase this one because it will stand the test of time. If you enjoy movies such as Braveheart, Roy Roy, Gladiator, The Last King, and others like these, then you'll be sure to love this one... with subtle principles of war, spiritual messages, a real tug at the heart, a little dash of humor. GREAT MOVIE!",9,0,4,8 June 2008
World Trade Center," OK but not that great
","Having experienced all the events of 911 from the first moment it began, I can say this movie was a great disappointment for me. It did evoke a few emotional memories from that awful day but overall it was not what I expected from Oliver Stone. It was not much better than any other average drama. The special effects were convincing enough and yet there still seemed to be something missing. There wasn't enough detail so as to show that there were other people in the general population that were also affected. It seemed to be a story about two men only.I think Oliver Stone is a great director and has many films to add to his achievements but I don't think this is one of them, in comparison. The cast was too small, given the magnitude of the event and all the peoples affected.",3,1,4,20 December 2006
