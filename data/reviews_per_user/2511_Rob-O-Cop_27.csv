First Man," Harder to sit through than a long distance flight in coach.
","Of all the things you could have done with a movie about the first man to go to the moon, this must be one of the worst directions to take.
It totally deflated the achievement by focusing on and portraying his wife as a negative flat and in this movie ugly (on the inside) shrew, and Niel being as emotionally flat and dull as her. I get that American cinema is all about reflecting and focusing on the dark at the moment, but my god it's a tedious and humorless film watch. I've had more fun at the dentist. I've had a less arduous time watching paint dry, and at this movies length I could have done a little of that while the movie played.
Apparently Armstrong and his family aren't as unlikable as this movie portrays, and he had a much more interesting arch to his life than we got to see in this visually clever but emotionally bitter film.
Thanks for dismantling and burning a story of triumph, and making another entry into the unwatchable disintegration of modern movie making.",4,6,12,15 December 2018
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Anderson actually claimed credit for writing this?
","Wow, directing a slick fx movie and putting your name to it is one thing, no shame in that but telling people you came up with this children's school play of dialog wouldn't seem to be a wise move. Embarrassingly bad dialog and shonky characters even for the cartoon nature of the show drag this juggernaut down down down. It didn't help that it was continuing the franchise of an instantly forgettable series and required you to remember who was what and why they were there from previous movies. I've seen them all and couldn't for the life of me remember a single thing about the last movie, it was that disposable. All that money and style up on screen and they couldn't do any better than this? it seems such a waste. eye candy fluff, if that's enough. it isn't for me, anymore.",5,2,8,7 October 2010
Hereditary," supreme evil taken out by a nut allergy
","Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this movie, well most of it. Toni Collette does a really great mad women off the rails and going to get us all killed routine, I don't think I could imagine her playing a nice character.
But the film reveals that grandma had installed assistant devil Paimon in the body of a young girl who eats a piece of chocolate cake at a party and through a bad reaction to it ends up dying in an accident. Lets think about that for a moment. His darkly evilness who the devil worship cult work looking up to to do some serious badness can't even control his host body to stop his throat from swelling. What good is he going to be in the rapture. 
Aside from that though some nicely creepy details. Be careful out there Beelzebub, don't die from a splinter off your wooden rocking chair.",7,0,1,7 September 2018
Train to Busan," Good zombie movie, Bad soap opera
","The zombie bits were good but unfortunately the bits in between and at the start were some pretty average family drama cliché. Daddy works too hard and the daughter resents it, school performance he didn't make it to, the Korean relationship dynamic cliché (I really hope this isn't normal in real life Korea but it appears in every relationship in their movies), nagging wife, dumb (huh?) beaten down husband. The self centered baddie is a pretty easy to loath character, so well done on that, the effects were nice, the zombies looked great, sound was great, cinematography was a bit 'digital camera', but passable. They laid the syrup sentimentality on with a shovel and it really drags the movie down, making a 6 instead of an 8.",6,27,68,13 September 2016
World War Z," Like watching Brad Pitt play a video game he's really good at from his lounge
","Visually there are some good scenes in this movie but the story is set up like video game levels and then most of those scenes play like a video game. The town escape, the W.H.O run, the airplane battle, Jerusalem. There are many elements to them that are cool but Pitt sails through them like he's already played the game before, no real engagement, he runs blankly from one vantage point to the next (via controller, left left, nudge pause), picking off targets (fire fire fire). He hardly breaks a sweat. The revelation points couldn't have been any more signposted if they'd circled them with highlighter pen for us. So really a video game with cheat sheet codes. Add to that the complete rewrite of the last 3rd of the story, it kind of leaves you wondering if the makers really had anything to say when they started the project.",6,0,1,13 November 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," 'star trek for people who hate Star Trek'
","If you love the star trek franchise because it consistently delivers thought provoking interesting stories without the brutality and violence that Hollywood seems hooked on, you're going to be as disappointed as I was with this movie.It looked big, the acting was really good, but JJ Abrams for some unknown reason decided it was necessary to remove the essence of what makes Star Trek different and replace it with some Michael Bay antics. At times it was like watching someone play a video game.It was a really well made waste of time. No insight into the human condition, no thinking necessary, just eye candy and forgettable events.And that's a shame, cos there was some great acting going on here. all the cast delivered well especially Cumberbatch and Quinto, some great looking effects, but why bother? When interviewed on the daily show Abrams actually said he wanted to make this movie for all the people who didn't like Star Trek. Isn't that just the stupidest thing you've ever heard?",5,29,42,31 August 2013
The Rocker," Jack Black ain't back
","it must be difficult to envisage an aging ex rocker that doesn't mirror the character that is jack black in school of rock, but if you were intending to make a new movie that had a lead character who was in a similar situation and head space to Jack Black's character surely you'd go way out of your way to make SURE you didn't do anything that vaguely resembled Mr Black. That hasn't happened here unfortunately so one must assume that making an original movie was not high on the list of priorities for these guys. Its not a bad movie at all but it's hard to watch it without being reminded of Jack Black doing similar things in his movies, and better too.",5,1,2,5 October 2008
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Good natured funny
","If you didn't find this funny then you're probably not familiar enough with the people and places it good-naturedly makes fun of.
If you've seen the bizarreness that is eurovision and the music, culture and art that comes from Europe then there's plenty of clever detail in this to make you laugh. I loved the clothes choices, the hair, the mannerisms language and accents.
It was very european and didn't go so much for the slapstick and nasty.
Even for Will Farrell who often does work in those tones this was something quite subtle.
The musical numbers were very well done and impressed while making fun of the topic. They were excellent examples of the things they were parodying and were pulled off with style. The Lyrics were hilarious.
Yes it was cringe humor, but it was done with style, heart and affection for the topic and people.",8,3,7,27 June 2020
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," looked great, but unsurprisingly played out like a video game
","The money was up there on the screen to see, it certainly looked exotic and rich but unsurprisingly the script is where the big holes lie, and I don't think it had to be that way. After managing to get my head around Jake Gyllenhaal's unusual accent which drifted in and out, and settling down with a visually stunning screen, it was time to digest the story and how it played out. I warmed to some of the characters after a patchy start but then they started feeding trite lectures through their mouths, particularly the princess's and it didn't even really make sense. But what did I expect right? it's a movie that expands on a jump and run video game. Pirates has shown us we can and should expect more and this movie was certainly stocked high with talented people so a quick look at the writing team explains the let down here. I could stand seeing a sequel to this but only if they get some writers with a little vision beyond the cliché. Just cos it's an action movie doesn't mean it has to be dumb. Well done everyone else.",6,2,3,17 August 2010
Terminator Salvation," too dumb to live
","This movie is pitched so low it insults the intelligence of all mankind. How stupid do the makers of this movie think we are. I get pitching a movie like a graphic novel, but why would you pitch a movie like a cartoon unless your audience was kids, and lets face it this movie series is about machines that kill humans, its given away in the title. Why would you do this to such an important and well represented franchise. once again there is a clue in the director. He made some adverts and charlies angels. The people who put their money behind this piece of very expensive garbage deserve to lose it. the dialogue is something else though. 3 people in a speeding truck being chase, The driver shouts 'hang on', not once but 3 times over the course of the chase. Gee, that's a good idea i wouldn't have thought of if it was me clutching to the vehicle. I would have been scratching my nose or something. insulting wasteful and shameful.Skynet is computers and robots yet they have a sophisticated laboratory with tables? Skynet develop sophisticated flying machines yet they also build motorbikes utilising the combustion engine?A guy who has been a sleeper for 20 years who was a simple murderer before comes back to life and is a skilled fighter, who proceeds to treat a seasoned female rebel like she is some sissy amateur (are you OK,get down, do as I say etc)The resistance made up of survivors all talk in American military speak in one scene and in the next are huddled round a fire being unskilled.The resistance seems to have limitless access to ammunition, fuel, arms etc, yet they have no factories to produce them?",1,12,23,21 July 2009
Cloverfield," where the F*** did this stunning movie come from
","I'd heard absolutely nothing about this movie when me and my girlfriend were at a local cinema stealing their free wireless internet to check some emails. I noticed the movie listed and because I'd already seen or knew I didn't want to see every other movie on the list (yes modern movie making is that bad) and I kinda just felt like sitting in a movie for a couple of hours we thought we'd check this one out. we checked it on IMDb first and no one knew much about it and there were no votes but we thought we'd risk it, a costly thing these days but we hadn't treated ourselves for a few weeks.The initial few minutes were not promising, not boring or anything but just a handy cam being played back of some teens party. then it all kicked in, and it was an exhilarating ride.Yes the whole movie is seen through the eyes of a handy cam, yes Blair witch did the same thing, but this is not Blair witch. This is a big movie. the special effects were stunning. The sound was mind-blowing, surround sound (a feature which no handy cam I know of records, but I'm just being picky, i wouldn't want to downgrade the experience with mono camera sound). The concept was handy cam but this was no low budget amateur movie. The picture quality was well better than home movie, the lighting was good, scenes and camera angles all contributing to the story. i.e. they didn't get too hung up on the concept, but used it to make the whole experience non stop edge of the seat thrilling.The story was nothing much, a love story spread over the main feature, an unexplained massive creature gets p!ssed off and rips Manhattan to pieces. basically Godzilla, but that was the point, it's really a concept movie, nothing more nothing less and as that it succeeds amazingly. this was one entertaining ride and maybe it shows what it would be like to be under siege by enemy forces without having to deal with all the hassles of politics, or maybe it's just a piece of well made entertainment.Afterward I was slightly disturbed by how this movie was marketed. as in I'd seen nothing of it, and its no small movie. What was their plan?. to get people used to going to see movies on a whim and being pleasantly surprised after years of mostly being disappointed with the dross that Hollywood serves up. I felt kind of manipulated even though in my case there was no manipulation cos I just turned up on a whim and was one of the first people in the world to see it. So I guess I'm playing right into the ad mans hands and spreading the word of mouth to get you to go and see this movie, cos it is what you want a movie to be, something you couldn't experience at home (the sound is amazing and no home cinema or laptop is going to reproduce that).This is a genre defining great movie. It's entertainment exceptionally well done, don't sit too close to the screen.",8,3,8,17 January 2008
Molly's Game," Good Criminal? How many wrongs make a right?
","Another in along line of American movies that glorifies and makes heroes of the act of skating the barely legal line for profit and self.
Molly Bloom's true story is a caper movie, except that her caper is a true story.
It's a reasonably made movie in the genre, flashy sets and costumes, idolizing the lifestyles of the rich and decadent, and in presenting it that way perpetuates the American dilemma of founding their culture on the self serving capitalist ahead of honest true and fair. 
Molly sets up an empire founded on the rocks of gambling addiction, opulence, obscene wealth and the abuse of that wealth, and the act of trying to skate as close to the legal line as possible while skating well over the lines of Good, Honest, True and Fair, and idolizing that behavior, in this case apparently in the interests of entertainment but on another level in the interests of normalizing Molly's behavior, it's fair because most of it doesn't technically break the law,while being well aware of how far over the line it goes for the acts of building a good community in it's preying on the addicted and fraternizing in the seedy underworld.
Molly's guilty of pushing society in a bad direction, but this film does just as much to normalize the behavior and then the media machine that lauds Molly's efforts to do right by her 'wrong' customers and keep their secrets secret, how many levels of wrong are we going down to come up with a right?
Go watch some interviews after watching this movie and look at the media scrambling to paint Molly as a role model for keeping her mouth shut. 
It's a case of not seeing the forest for the trees. Her act of loyalty is seen as good except it's loyalty to a sick society, granted loyalty against another sick portion of the same society, the messed up law enforcement sector.
There's so many levels of wrong from this kind of movie, and this movie in particular, and it's all wrapped up in an easily digestible entertainment package.This is a loose for everyone involved, audience, Molly, film makers, media, society in general, but technically it's a well made piece of cinema so points for that.I feel bad for having watched it now.
And thanks for making me rant like a fundamentalist for noticing this stuff. Stop making this damaging rubbish and glorifying these people. The only plus was there wasn't much in the way of graphic violence and lovingly portrayed gun play, well, apart from her beating.",5,5,9,27 May 2018
Begin Again," Hidden insight in a rom com shell
","I almost didn't get to see this movie, missed it the first time round due to it's terrible name and marketing, and that would have been a loss to me because it's a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie about the art and pleasure of creativity. There are some brilliantly insightful and well presented scenes in this movie that are to do with how creativity happens and they really click with people who do this stuff, which is a rarity in cheesy ripoff Hollywood who would rather sensationalise simplify and adapt for dramatic value every true story and experience out there. In particular the scene where Mark Ruffalo's character imagines the production of a raw song rings exceptionally and insightfully true. I loved it, and his delivery is fantastic for it, as he buzzes of each imagined part he introduces. I loved the concept they gave the album, The movie isn't perfect but the delivery manages to gloss over the cliché boardroom meetings and hip hop star for laughs bits, the credits ending bit raises a bunch of complex issues it has no hope of dealing with in the space of the credit roll, But the bristly character deliveries ring true, due to the improvised dialogue approach, and the music is really really good, much better than we should expect for a movie about making music rather than a fully fledged pop album. And the movie was fun, in a time when every other movie is dark and depressing. This wins on so many levels.",8,1,1,21 October 2016
The Lost City of Z," This world is flat
","For the story this film was based on it comes across as flat and boring. From the dull performance and stiff delivery of the lead character as he tried too hard to do the accent, to the unimpressive cinematography and locations, this was nowhere near as entertaining as it should have been. And it wasn't like it was without budget. The WW1 scenes and the UK period crowd scenes couldn't have been cheap and easy to stage, so why not plow the same effort into the jungle scenes, where the whole point of the wonder and awe of the story is about? They actually went to the Jungle, why not find some decent shots while you're there? Robert Patterson did deliver a good performance, and the last 20 mins was halfway decent possibly just because the mood was set as mysterious and disorientating via some finally decent music choices. There were quite a few clichÃ© clunker lines and dilemmas in the film, you know the sort of thing, class issues, gender stereotypes, war pep talks, my eyes rolled every time one came along and it added to my non enjoyment of the film. We expect more in modern cinema. Overall the story just wasn't told that well. Things that could have been dramatic were delivered in confusing ways and just sailed off having left no mark. It's got to come down to director and co writer James Gray unfortunately. Disappointed that this wasn't a good watch. It should have been.",5,0,0,17 August 2017
Hugo," Uneven mish mash makes a bit of a mess
","It's hard to put a finger on the problem with this movie. It is watchable but difficult to get through. The pacing is all over the show. Was that the editor or the director? One minute it's a children's fantasy movie, the next it's a history lesson on the birth of cinema reading from a text book, that will go right over the heads of it's child audience. There is some stunning cinematography here, all the shots of the automaton are jaw dropping, the station too, and there's some great acting too , Chloe just oozes vibrancy into her role, conveys a sincerity and believable quality to her performance, and Asa has his moments too. Is it the script that drags them through too much filler to keep it up though, or was that the editor holding too long on that thought shot? Certainly we should expect more from Scorsese, or maybe he can only do violent adult movies, There are some really good ideas in this movie, but they don't fit together very well as a whole. They were trying for 'something' but maybe a simpler approach would have made a more mesmerising result.",6,1,4,20 June 2016
Bad Teacher," Labored and lame
","I can't believe I actually managed to get through this movie. It was everything that has been wrong with American comedy and them some. Actors who have previously dealt us some high quality work having their efforts reduced to a sitcom laugh track level just doesn't make sense I can only be directing and editing to blame for this badly timed badly executed and quite possibly badly written mess. It looked recycled and labored from the first few minutes and the following 90 mins was completely consistent with that, painfully so.Movies and comedy in general have moved on so far from this and the actors in this steaming pile have been in some of the better examples of that progress. In the light of that this movie just doesn't make sense. Why doe it even exist?",2,10,17,8 August 2011
Yesterday," An insightful thought provoking comedy, till almost the end
","A fantastic idea well executed with some great details and insight. The characters were fun and funny, in a low key British way. I loved the multi racial but still British landscape, also this is one of those rare films with no cartoon baddie verses good set up, there is no real baddie in the movie, (much like miyazaki's totoro and kiki's), and the interest comes from looking into the what ifs more than the unrequited love aspect, which was well done and Lily James was gorgeous and Himesh Patel was suitably oblivious etc, it was needed for the story but it lead to be the rather too neat and tidy focus of the ending, ie it ended up being a love story more than an intriguing sci fi one.
I loved how the story didn't try an make a blackmail aspect to the 'others' story angle, showing Richard Curtis didn't want to go for the obvious with this film, and instead chose fascinating angles to investigate.
And that went right through to the jokes and set ups. The board meeting didn't play it for cliche laughs but those laughs were definitely there.
Ed Sheeran was pretty gracious with laughs at his expense too, the Rap line was great, and he was pretty low key in his delivery.
Just a pleasant fun watch with some great thought provoking set ups and of course a show case for the genius of the Beatles songs, which were on the whole really well delivered. Dan Pemberton soundtrack too to augment an already excellent collection of material.
Pretty much wins all around except for the cheesy romance ending.",7,0,0,18 September 2019
Mr. Nobody," confused kitchen sink muddle
","Jaco Van Dormael has never met a cliché setup he wouldn't try to shoe horn into this movie. lots of setups we've seen before this time done exactly the same but choreographed to perfection, lit and shot beautifully like a car commercial, but still a cliché, and I kind of expect more from my cinema. Guy trapped in a sinking car, boy chasing a train with mother holding out hand, cryo life support pods, proms and dying wishes, every movie cliché there is all crow-bared into this film. All that money you can see on the screen, but it came across as something less than meaningful.I'm not sure who was responsible for the music choices in this movie but they were hardly enlightened either. Tracks we've heard in a hundred other movies here to make you wince at the obviousness of their presence.Jared Leto was also particularly bad. He wasn't once convincing. wearing a set of dark rimmed glasses doesn't make you older, he just looked like a youth with glasses and not a father of 3 with a career and wife. He's also under the miles of make up for the old guy but the thrill of that was truly killed by Brad Pitts similar exploits in Benjamin Button.There were good performances in this. The three wives were great as were the teen actors.I just feel disappointed after watching this. So much talent and money went into it yet it rang hollow. It did have some great ideas but they were watered down with the clichés, It had some wonderful technically brilliant camera and staging work but without the cohesive story and the average acting and cliché elements it was all weakened.This looks like a movie where director Jaco van Dormael pulled in every favor he had owning to him, his big break movie with a ton of cash thrown at it, and he dropped the ball.",6,18,41,21 July 2010
The Mist," ???? this from the guy who made shawshank redemption????
","I'm confused. wasn't the shawshank redemption a good movie?? isn't this the same director??? so what went wrong?? firstly it was lit like a TV sitcom. everyone was brightly lit, even in the night time scenes. Secondly, characters, OK so he's asking us to believe some characters do extreme things, and then for us to consider the impact and compare it to todays world. we'll you'd have to make those characters convincing, believable and understand why they did those things. I'm talking mainly about the preacher religion aspect of the story. If you want us to believe that a group of people would change to the will of a ranting religious extremist in the space of 2 days you're going to have to do better than that. witnessing the halfassed preacher woman character fail at delivering a convincing religious persuader just ruined any mileage the other characters managed. some of the others were OK. Toby Jones did a good job of his character, and Thomas Jane was also passable except in the end scene.how ever did this get a rating in the high 7's. anyone who's actually seen it and didn't work on the movie will argue with that figure. 4-5 tops. honestly.",3,1,5,24 March 2008
A Quiet Place," Sound Proofing - Smart people doing stupid things
","A continuation of the trend for scripts to be based purely on smart people doing stupid things to move the story along.
In this case they've created a story along the interesting concept of monsters with fantastic hearing who hunt and kill swiftly. Good premise, and it could have worked if they'd got someone who understood the laws of physics and extrapolated how these new condition of keeping quiet could impact on how people act. 
Our family live in a farm house with the windows open, no attempt to sound proof what-so-ever, hang out in barns with flimsy roofs and generally make all the wrong efforts to keep quiet. Apparently barefeet and sand is the way to keep your foot traffic noise down, not silent sneakers. Where making noise is a matter of life and death some simple sound concepts seem beyond them. Did the film makers not consult the most basic of sound engineers?
Stylistically the film is pretty well done, but you have to be as stupid as the characters to buy the story and judging by the other reviews viewers in general are not that stupid and have felt like me their intelligence has been insulted, in a high production standard broken script kind of way.",5,1,3,2 July 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Unexpectdedly good
","I know we all want to slag off a franchise that has supposedly outstayed its welcome and it certainly felt that way judging by the last couple of films in the series, but this one was surprisingly watchable. It had a few really well pulled off set pieces, (the bank job, all the sea footage etc etc), and a stunning ace with Javier Bardem's revenge driven character. Geoffrey Rush added new depth to his character while keeping the ground he'd already made with him intact, as did Kevin McNally with his Gibbs character. The backward steps didn't really detract from the ride but certainly didn't help. Depp's Jack Sparrow didn't add anything to the soup except a few cheap laughs,although flash back scenes were nice. The new characters were sufficient in their roles as Henry Turner (Will and Elizabeth's son) and 'scientist' Carina Smyth. The special effects and stunts were outstanding. Especially Barden's effects makeup, matched with his delivery, adding real menace to his character. The aforementioned bank scene, the guillotine scene, multiple sailing ship battles and crashes, all looked and felt stunning. And foremost, the story was tight and relevant to the POTC legend. It linked in with the themes of the series and expanded on them nicely. This is nowhere near as bad as I've read it is, and is much better than the last 2 installments thanks to the points noted above. Totally worth a watch.",8,0,1,23 October 2017
Love & Mercy," Cartoons in primary colors
","On one level this is an enjoyable, sculpted film, competently acted and directed. On another level it renders Brian Wilson's compelling story as a cartoon, with one dimensional villain, and henchmen, and spotless do nothing wrong heroes, in the angelic only-missing-a-halo Girlfriend and the charmingly whacky Wilson himself. His band of brothers are cut out 60's clichés, Mike love clearly cast in his darker shade and the others in shades of invisible. None of these characters are rendered in any detail beyond what we'd expect in a children's cartoon. And when you notice that it makes the whole film a much lesser event that's hard to take seriously, and that does a disservice to Wilson's story. While I enjoyed the recording and youthful Wilson sections the set ups are just too bombastic to nail home the agenda of Evil shrink, Henchmen, Angelic GF, Simple naive central figure etc. No subtlety, no real shades, just primary colors.",5,16,26,12 September 2015
The Witch," Pant sh!ttingly creepy
","Excellent period creepy as fruck story of a time when this stuff was believable done in a way to make you give it the time of day. All the characters are played impeccably and believably, as much as we know anything about the reality of the period, I totally believe it was exactly like this. The outside scenes seem all to be shot at dusk or dawn and have that disturbing non sunlight vibe to it, again completely intended I'm sure. Great to see a movie commit so solidly to an idea. No I don't believe in witches but for the duration of this movie they had me give it the benefit of the doubt. Now if you'll excuse me I have to have a restless few hours sleep before I get the benefit of sunlight to wash away the fear. Well done.",8,0,2,8 June 2016

This is the biggest worst talent black hole since movie 43, a well made terrible idea, well, I don't know that the actual idea is so bad, just the delivery style.

The Proposal," As subtle as a gun
","Sandra Bullock said in an interview that she was leaving rom com alone for a while and perhaps it would have been a wise move to have stuck to the intent of that statement. Her performance in this film is one of its biggest flaws. Her delivery is as subtle as a gun, subtle as circus clowns with big shoes and a plank of wood. This was like stage slapstick rather than cinema. Overblown actions and responses, painted in large black and white lines and yet it still managed to seem muddled and unnatural. There were 2 saving graces. one was the location. A beautiful Alaskan setting and stunning house. The second was Ryan Reynolds who even in a derivative uninspiring flat piece of movie making like this can still manage to put in a great performance. Granted it's a performance he's put into many of his roles before, but he's imminently likable and watchable. He doesn't put in obvious primary colours to his work and for that he is always the one to watch. I doubt the director guided him to this judging by the 2 dimensional rest of the movie. Most of the good gags were in the trailer. I'm so pleased we got free passes to a preview, I just wish they'd been to another movie, like a half decent one. Please stop making these kind of movies Sandra. You're not without talent but you've got to start figuring out what that talent is, and it's not lame over acted rom com.",5,1,12,15 June 2009
Sully," Hanks delivers quality, Eastwood delivers old man Hollywood clichés
","This is a great story and Hanks and Ekhart deliver strong performances, and that really should be enough to make a great movie but sprinkled throughout it are cliché shot after cliché dialog. Sully jogs, and 'thinks', almost getting hit by a cab driver who delivers a cliché cab driver line. Lot's of cliché 'thinking' shots cos we've got to know that Sully is 'thinking'. It just comes across as uninspired obvious film making and we should be seeing better from Eastwood and whoever wrote the script. Eastwood and script writer also choose to manufacture confrontation when in the original story it wasn't there, showing they fell short on the skill and ability to tell an exciting story about decent good people doing good things in difficult situations without making stuff up. Artistic license is in how you tell the story, not the details of it. Maybe it's time Eastwood retired to day time telly making,",6,0,1,30 March 2017
Furious 7," IQ leeching pumped up cartoon
","I managed to skip all the movies after the first one but got tricked by some positive reviews into wasting my time watching this. As each scene passed I felt a little bit of my intelligence and soul leech out into the ether. The dumbness was overpowering. From the comedy level pumped up arms and chest of the actors, to the stupid earnestness they pursued their vacuous lives,everything about this movie is dumb, big, and dumb. I had to skip over parts of it just to survive it's all pervasive stupidity. I've seen Dwyane be good in other films, but not here, Even Vin's done decent work that doesn't aim for the brain dead grunters, but there's no sign of that here, there's no indication of self-awareness. I should have stuck with my instincts and avoided this. What was I thinking? What were they thinking.",4,5,32,30 January 2016
