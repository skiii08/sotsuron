The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Awesome Movie
",Awesome. I just watched it a few hours back.... Edward looks super handsome (as always)... the wedding and honeymoon scenes are mind-blowing..... the birth scene is so intense... the fight scenes b/w vampires and werewolves is cool too.... Wanna get a DVD asap... Cant wait for part-2. Stephanie Meyer is shown attending the wedding :) Bella's wedding dress is just so beautiful and all vampire girls look stunning.......... a lot new of new characters too.... Seth is cute... Alice looks very nice... so does Emmett and Jasper... The honeymoon is quite sexy.... Isle Esme is very beautiful in the movie..... A lot of things in the book are missing... but since a movie can only be 2 hours I guess thats fine...,10,19,42,18 November 2011
