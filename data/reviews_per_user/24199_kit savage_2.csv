Walk the Line," Stellar but grounded
","Like many others who saw this film, I was not a fan of Johnny Cash's music. That fact held me back from seeing this movie. So after I had viewed all the other 'top' films from last year, and being disappointed in almost every one of them, I finally rented 'Walk the Line' and was knocked out by the film, the performances, and ironically, the music. It touched me emotionally, and gave me a reason to believe that there are still great movies being made with honesty and no CGI effects to rely on.The film starts with a pulsating roar that keeps building while the camera winds its way slowly inward past nervous looking prison guards and nervous looking band members, until it is revealed that the noise is coming from a hundred pairs of feet, stomping on the floor. This audience is ready for their hero, however unlikely he is. Then just as suddenly the film reveals the beginning of where the story of Johnny Cash starts- in the poverty of the south, where everybody is poor and hard work the steady diet. There is his older brother Jack, with a heart of love who is worshiped by his younger brother, Johnny known as J.R. by the family. Johnny knows his older brother Jack is the worthy one in the family, just as he believes he is unworthy as his father makes sure he realizes over and over again throughout his life. The only respite from this tortured childhood is found in the music coming from the radio, and the hymns his mother sings.To escape from this father who will never stop with his 'Where were you?' guilt routine John signs up for military service and the film shows how once away from home he finds his first guitar and humbly starts to write songs, the seed of creativity is allowed out and we watch as he finds music to become his sole reason for living. Juaquin Phoenix starts to wear Johnny Cash not only on the outside, but becomes the man himself, a transformation complete as it gets. Reese might have won for best actress as June Carter Cash, but if Jamie Foxx had not won for best actor in Ray the year before I believe it would have gone to this performance by Juaquin.When this film backs up the outstanding acting with the music (helped by T. Bone Burnnett) the feel, look and sound of this movie becomes complete. As the film unfolds the genuine attraction between Johnny and June only serves to underscore the unhappiness of his marriage to Vivianne, his first wife. The re-creation of the musical performances have every bit of reality as the originals. As the years progress and we see Johnny Cash hit his musical height, we also see him brought down to his lowest points, with the use of drugs to keep him numb enough not to feel the pain of his childhood, and his unhappy marriage.This film delivers on every level. By the end I felt my emotional investment in the movie worthwhile, done by the pure craft work in the writing, the filming, the performances and the music. Not bought by cheap CGI effects or a glossy overly produced high budget blockbuster. Just a satisfied feeling that the life of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash was well told, and kudos to the fine ability of the cast and crew.",10,0,0,28 April 2006
Crash," The city of 'Lost' Angeles at its worst- and best.
","I saw this film over two months ago and it's still going through my mind. The main character is the Los Angeles I live in- most of us isolated in our cars as we travel though our daily lives on congested freeways and streets, inching slowly towards our destinations. Only when forced by the usual violent circumstances do we rub up against our varied ethnic communities only to realize how different we all are- and yet, as this film reveals, how similar our humanity is.Crash is a great ensemble film, drawing together actors that give both subtle and dramatic life to their characters. Sandra Bullock for once reveals a dramatic edge to her acting ability, and Don Cheadle as always, shows his talent a hundred percent. The rest of the cast stands out in their ability to give this film not only the different contrasts between the characters, but also the thin gray lines that blur stereotypes. Paul Haggis shows us how fear keeps us isolated, and yet how once in a while when it is called for our humanity brings us together to show how much we all share in common.This film is helped out by outstanding camera work and a soundtrack that adds greatly to the emotions revealed in it. Although I have mixed feelings about recommending any movie (everybody has their own different opinions when it comes to watching a film) this is one film I feel moved to talking about to friends. When award time comes around I feel this one should be on the list for consideration.",10,0,5,21 July 2005
