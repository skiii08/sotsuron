Casablanca," Masterpiece of understatement
","Without doubt the cast is incomparable, but even so the script is the real star of Casablanca. Everyone has a sob story to tell (except for the Nazis who have given people the material for their own sob stories), but the movie would sink into the most depressing experience possible if the script didn't cut off the sob stories before people started to show self-pity. The only self-pitying character is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) -- who doesn't realize how lucky he is to be an American. Such is the genius of this movie, the explanation of its location in both the AFI's '100 Best Films' and IMDb voters' choice of it -- both in the Top 10. Today it is impossible to imagine anyone not delving into one's own abyss of hurt feelings under such circumstances. Casablanca in 1941 is Purgatory; occupied Europe is Hell, even if it is a man-made Inferno, and the Nazis intend to make their Hell more fearsome than any that Dante thought up.Casablanca succeeds because it forces us to feel empathy for the victims of nazism -- people who have been sent into concentration camps, rich people who have become paupers because the Nazis confiscated their fortunes, people displaced. We are left to our own devices to imagine what Rick Blaine and Ilse Lund (Bergman) did in Paris. We find comic elements, but the comic scenes underscore the desperation that people feel, as in the pickpocket vignette; as the pickpocket fleeces a patron of Rick's bar, the pickpocket gives a smarmy lecture 'there are vipers, vipers...', and the Dutch banker feels his pockets. Happiness is entirely to be found in nostalgia for better days, or hope for the future for a restoration of things as they were before the war. Who can forget the scene in which the Germans sing 'Die Wacht am Rhein' (actually, an innocuous patriotic song from the 19th century), only to hear almost everyone else break into a rousing 'Marseillaise', with the resolution of the situation with the police prefect ordering the bar closed for 'gambling', the police prefect collecting his winnings. Casablanca relates one moment in time -- arguably the most desperate moment in time for refugees from the Hell of nazi Germany and its empire, when Britain stood alone or when Russia seemed on the brink of collapse, before the United States was in the war and sealed the fate of nazi Germany, and before the fullest horrors of nazism became known.This is an absolute must see. A basic rule for any collection: it is far better to have one great movie than five 'fair' ones, and forget the bad ones altogether.",10,1,2,22 January 2004
The Birth of a Nation," Technical masterpiece, vicious propaganda
","-The Birth of a Nation- is a technical masterpiece, one of the first convincing settings of a grand epic. Through the Civil War one has a picture little more objectionable than -Gone With the Wind- , the first movie about the Civil War and its aftermath to upstage it. -Gone With the Wind- is also racist by standards of our time.D.W. Griffith gets obvious credit for creating a convincing story line, for innovative techniques of camera work, and convincing battle scenes. If some parts of it -- especially the racial stereotypes and the mythologized history -- look hokey, then think of how much more sophisticated Americans are ninety years later, when the Ku Klux Klan is an object of ridicule even in the South.Whatever you say about the message, you must admit that the character of 'Silas Lynch' (George Siegmann, obviously a white man in blackface), is one of the most convincing villains of the screen -- a base man who achieves great power as Lieutenant Governor after the Civil War but uses it only for base ends, somewhat analogous to the 'Adenoid Hynkel' character that Chaplin created in -The Great Dictator- . Likewise, 'Lydia Brown' (Mary Alden, a white woman in blackface), a conniving, devious, but ignorant villainess. Are those characters mere stereotypes? Sure. They are about as realistic as the fake dye on their faces and the shoe polish hair. In 1915, most white people didn't know that.It is not until the Reconstruction that things get objectionable. Say all that one wants about the Reconstruction governments -- they were on a whole less corrupt and more responsive to the needs of poor people in the South than any that followed until at least the 1960s, even if the poor blacks who won some elections were often ill-prepared for holding power (as if the plantation system were intended to prepare a slave for anything other than abject servitude). The only 'good' blacks are those who subordinate themselves to white people in knowledge of their 'God-ordained, lowly place'. A white do-gooder like 'Austin Stoneman' (Ralph Lewis) sees nothing wrong with black power until his daughter Elsie (Lilian Gish) becomes the object of a lurid affection from 'Silas Lynch'. No matter what one's views on the Ku-Klux-Klan of the Reconstruction era or of later Klans, one must admit that its 'cavalry charge' is impressive. The great paradox is that D.W. Griffith wanted an anti-war movie, but -Birth of a Nation- ends in the triumph of the Ku-Klux-Klan, a group even more violent than the cardboard villains and crazed fools that Griffith portrays. How could the final scene -- an election in which dirty tricks are played upon potential black voters -- serve a sustainable peace? Nearly a century later, it isn't -The Birth of a Nation- that has changed; it is we Americans who have changed. America even elected Barack Obama as President.The very survival of America depended upon the defeat of two monstrous enemies, Nazi Germany and thug Japan, for which racism was the cornerstone of the empires that their leaders sought to build. We can no longer see this gigantic epic, half brilliant and half horrific, as people might have seen it a century ago. Thank God -- and better yet, thank Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, and other real heroes.",6,3,7,26 May 2004
Beauty and the Beast," Spectacularly beautiful, if anachronistic.
","It's hard to imagine a more delightful telling of a fairy tale. Sure, there are some anachronisms, but this is fantasy: clocks did not exist until the Renaissance, and modern eating utensils (knives, forks and spoons) are decidely not medieval. Above all, Belle is a feminist and a bookworm, two rarities of the Middle Ages, and above all a person more sophisticated and mature than the typical denizen of the Middle Ages. Then again, so is the curse that turns the Prince into the Beast... Characters are well-defined. We see Gaston, the rival for Belle's affection, a man who could supposedly have any woman of his choosing and can't appreciate his pretty toadies, as a crude, boastful, male-chauvinist pig and as an organizer of mob violence against The Beast.     
Disney's trademark anthropomorphism of animals and even such objects as plates, candles, knives, forks, and spoons reaches the zenith in 'Be Our Guest', a dance sequence that would have put Busby Berkeley to shame, to music reminiscent of the first movement of Mahler's Third Symphony. (If you don't know who Gustav Mahler was, he was merely the greatest symphonist since Beethoven). Realistic? No -- it's a fairy tale, one very much in the canon.  The best-established fairy tales have lives of their own. An absolute must-see.",10,4,5,7 July 2003
The Great Dictator," A great last hurrah for The Tramp
","For a lesser actor, the scariest fate is to be typecast. Even so, no actor so allowed himself to be typecast as Charles Chaplin. But this is the inimitable Charlie Chaplin; he did it to himself, and he endured the consequences -- artistic success that no other actor could ever achieve. The great Charlie did well.Charles Chaplin succeeds as nobody else in the famous dual role as the Tramp, essentially the same character as he had been for over 25 years, and as 'Adenoid Hynkel', also known as 'Der Phooey' (spoof of Hitler's popular title 'Der Fuhrer', undeniably a parody of Adolf Hitler, the evil dictator of 'Ptomania', undoubtedly a spoof of (nazi) Germany (get it -- 'ptomaine' is a very bad germ) and its dictator.The classic Tramp of the pioneer days of motion pictures is this time a Jewish barber, a victim of the absurd persecution of an innocent people -- and he also looks like the hollow, silly 'Adenoid Hynkel'. As with other movies featuring the Tramp, one laughs with him as he endures the absurd situations of helpless humanity. We laugh at the Great Dictator for the harshness of his voice (Chaplin did not have an attractive voice), his rhetoric, his vanity, and his hypocrisy. The Tramp character is the common man in a nearly-hopeless situation; Adenoid Hynkel is a base man risen to power that he can never use except for the basest and most selfish, cruel purposes. The characters in their unique split roles meet in the most remarkable manner at the end of the movie, and to say more about that juxtaposition of characters is to introduce a spoiler. If you have never seen this movie, then see it at the first opportunity. The superb physical comedy from the silent era survives without deterioration both as the Tramp and as the Great Dictator -- remarkable for his age (51) at the time, and for the fact that Chaplin did not age gracefully even if he lived into his late eighties. As usual Chaplin uses few words, illustrating his true ties to the silent era. For good reason Chaplin was slow to make a full adoption of his own voice in cinema -- but in its harshness it well fits the vile Adenoid Hynkel, a man who like his obvious model wins the predictable adulation of adoring crowds who have surrendered their freedom. We laugh AT Adenoid Hynkel, a man who wistfully tosses a globe about disrespectfully, only to cause it to pop like a balloon; we see a microphone recoil from the harshness of his banal speech as a cowardly audience can't. But the unnamed Jewish tramp (and the other Jews)... we recognize a character that we can't do without -- the person who, however rational, can treat tragedy and despair with humor and innocence.The movie ends with a cornball speech... corny now, but effective then, one in which the Tramp must pose as 'Der Phooey' and use the misbegotten fame of a bad man -- against all of the evil that 'Der Phooey' had wreaked upon the world. See it, by all means.",9,6,9,31 March 2004
Home Alone," Guilty pleasure in an implausible movie
","This movie stretches credibility to its limits. Sure, it's a comedy, so it can get away with some stuff. A kid is more competent than everyone else in an upper-middle-class family and he gets stuck at home because the family doesn't count its kids right. Two dimwitted crooks set out to burglarize a house believing that the family is away for the holiday; the kid is there, and he is a menace. The kid has an engineering talent freakishly developed for a ten-year-old kid and the sadistic cleverness that that he exposes in creating Rube Goldberg-like devices for tormenting a pair of burglars who fail to get the message that there really is someone there. I know that the garden variety of crooks are usually on the low side on intellectual development, but one time would be enough -- right? How many times do those crooks have to take falls, burns, and sharp objects into them before they learn?It's somewhat fun -- if you can pass up the stupidity, the gaps in the plot, and the mean-spiritedness beneath a saccharine veneer.",6,0,1,22 January 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Special effects can't rescue this disaster
","Disaster movies must convince one not only that something very bad and unforeseen can happen, but also that the victims deserve sympathy, which requires acting.What could be more disastrous than the destruction of the great centers of civilization by a moving mountain of ice that grinds or crushes everything in its path? That's enough to bring instant overpopulation in a world whose resources are vastly diminished, which isn't quite the same as complete destruction of either humanity or the world, as through worldwide volcanism or the explosion of the sun.The budget goes to special effects at the expense of writing and acting, as is shown in this effort at a politically-correct warning that human activities may bring the swift demise of their world. All dialogue is a shout (which is tiresome) except for the implausible monologue at the end. Much of the rest is mocked-up news footage, and there's only so much of that that we can accept.It is scientifically implausible, which isn't the worst offense, but that does destroy much of the credibility. Although some glacial advances came very far very fast, they certainly did not arise from the freezing of floodwater, and didn't take a few weeks. A few decades, to be sure, but that scientific fact (distressing enough!) would tear at the plot. It is possible to play a sort of game of logging the scientific absurdities, but surely you have better things to do in life than to watch and analyze a dreadful flick. Part of it is -Twister- on a larger scale (Los Angeles); the wolf scene is an obvious rip-off of -Jurassic Park-. Nothing is really new except for the scale of the disaster, and scale is not enough to redeem an unwieldy plot.",3,0,2,20 January 2005
Cold Mountain," Gore with the Wind (visual pun intended)
","This could have been a classic anti-war movie, but it fell short because it entered the realm of offense. I could tolerate the battle scenes at Petersburg, including even the throwing of bayonets. War is horrible, and anything less than explicit statement of its horrors is necessary. The Battle of Petersburg presaged trench warfare as practiced a half-century later in World War I.This movie falls short of greatness because of all the gore not related to battle. So many people and animals are killed in gruesome ways that I had to avert my head several times. That's enough to drop this movie from an 8 to a 7 or a 6.5.I like the acting of Kidman, Zellweger, Law, and Sutherland; all characterize themselves well.  Kidman and Zellweger exemplify the class divide between the elites and the 'po-white trash'; Kidman as 'Ada Monroe' is wonderfully versed in everything devoid of vocational practicality, and Zellweger, as 'Ruby Thewes', is the 'farm-smart' young woman devoid of all social graces and little book-learning; the two are perfect complements. Law convinces one that he has been betrayed by the promises of a cheap and easy victory as the war comes to the point of Confederate doom and that all that is left is the inevitable sockdolager punch into an enfeebled Confederacy. Sutherland, as Reverend Monroe (Ada's father), reminds one an many ways of the 'Gerald O'Hara' patriarch of _Gone with the Wind_.The gore in part results from the villainous 'Home Guard' enforcing its authority against deserters, Union sympathizers, escaping slaves, supporters of any of the above, and anyone with whom the Home Guard has scores to settle. This vigilante force strips all romance from the Confederacy by exposing the Confederacy as a collection of brutal police states and exposes itself as a precursor of the Ku Klux Klan, if not the Gestapo. Add to this the gruesome demises of animals, including a rooster, a goat, and a wild turkey; a rabbit nearly meets such a fate except that the Confederate soldiers in a trench chasing it get blown away in an explosion under the trench. To be sure, they all become dinner, but we don't need to see the inside of an abattoir, do we?  This could have been a great movie, even the most obvious second choice to -Gone with the Wind-... if only the director could have shown some restraint in depicting death. The old Hays Code would have made this a great movie. Excess is not greatness!",Null,1,2,31 January 2004
Gandhi," Essential history; good guys can win with good will and not guns
","For all the macabre fascination with the unqualified bad guys of history that we have (how often do Hitler, Stalin, or even Mussolini appear as characters in movies), it's worth noting that the influence of Mohandas Gandhi has already outlasted that of any of the twentieth-century bad guys. Decolonization of Asia and Africa looks more permanent than the colonial empires.Gandhi was the most important of those who whittled away at colonial power, and surprisingly the least military and despotic. The Indian subcontinent was not the first part of the colonial world to get full independence, but it was the most important region, and in view of the obvious power of the British Empire it seemed the least likely to get it. In view of the contrast between India and much of the rest of the post-colonial world, India has probably done best in politics because of Gandhi.Gandhi appealed to the best in human nature, and if he didn't always succeed at bringing it out, he at least didn't make a mess of things with a personality cult or a lust for riches. An unlikely hero of a revolution, he had few tools for changing the world: ideas and ideals. Mandela, Havel, Walesa, and of course Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. owed much to him. Better Gandhi than Mao, Ho Chi Minh, or Fidel Castro.The movie moves slowly, as it must; Gandhi was a contemplative man more than his fascistic antithesis, the so-called 'Man of Action'. Likewise, 'his' India is an undeniably gritty place -- which is all that it can be. This movie is a tribute to the elegance of thought of one of the most genuine, honest, and decent Great Men of History, and the elegance shows.",9,5,9,11 March 2003
City of God," It leaves the judgments to the viewer
","With a Dickensian plot (if the content is un-bowdlerized), a child nicknamed 'Rocket' (as translated in the English subtitles) relates his rise from a ghetto-dweller to a successful photojournalist who exposes the harsh world of his origin to the complacent Brazilians who live in the picture-postcard world of its upper and middle classes, and his entry into their world. 'Rocket' is effectively the narrator.This masterful filming establishes the human condition wherever people are neglected because they are 'inconvenient'. The place could just as easily be Soweto or even Detroit. The poor try to survive by doing the dirty work that the bourgeoisie needs to have done but won't do itself. Parents may have aspirations for their children's improvement and insist that they go to school, study, and prepare to do honest work. The easy money of illegal activities, whether robberies or drug dealing, intoxicates some, and draws them into a trap. Personal 'honor' is to be protected at all costs to others, and thus the vendetta. But such is the sociological angle, and most of us have seen that story in a newspaper.It's an exciting tale of survival and shaky success -- and of the ultimate dangers of crime. It's also a romance and a tale of the richness of the popular culture which on occasion brings some brightness into the dreary slum. But such brightness results from successful crooks getting control and showing off their success with the monetary fruits of their drug-trafficking. Not surprisingly, it erupts into a local civil war.'Rocket' demonstrates that with some sensitivity and some usefulness he can beat the odds stacked against him. Does he? To give the answer introduces a spoiler. Just watch the movie; except for the sexuality it might as well be a Brazilian version of-Te Godfather- with a few plot twists.The cinematography is spectacular, but beware: there is much violence, and much sexuality. It is rightfully rated 'R'; nobody in his right mind would want his children to imitate any of the criminal deeds shown in this film. Overt sexuality, including interracial sexuality, will offend some people. (Note that interracial sexuality in American movies is ordinarily exploitative. Not here!) That said, the filmmaker has chosen to not make any preachy comment on whether the social conditions are at all tolerable, whether drug use is desirable, or whether the violence that results from 'turf wars' or retribution against real or imagined slights to one's 'honor' are excusable. That's for the viewer to decide.",10,5,10,25 January 2005
Lincoln," Masterful cinema -- avoids the predictable cliché
","Stephen Spielberg has succeeded at making a movie about Abraham Lincoln without telling us what we already know. It would be easy to turn any project about our 16th President into a one-man show, transforming a fictionalized biopic into a dull documentary in practice. He found away around that by letting others say what Lincoln said. He draws us into the nation's capital and the political process of the time, showing the political order, warts and all. He puts most of the action in the weak light of fireplaces, candles, and gas lamps, giving us a feel that we are back in the time of Abraham Lincoln as no other brightly-lit staging could ever give us.This is a very human Abraham Lincoln that we see -- and not a stiff granite statue beyond human feeling and doubt. Lincoln had his feelings and his doubts -- and those made him human AND great. It is about one piece of critical legislation, the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in America... and its significance. (The Confederacy would have gladly surrendered so long as it could maintain slavery, which would have been the equivalent of winning the war but losing the peace)POSSIBLE SPOILER: Stephen Spielberg cleverly avoids leading us into the predictable necessary last event in the life of Abraham Lincoln, the ultimate cliché of history, by having a son at some theater not named after someone named Ford.",10,3,6,9 April 2013
Grave of the Fireflies," A survival tale
","Grave of the Fireflies, set in Japan during the hellish summer of 1945, tells the story of a boy who takes on the duty of looking out not only for himself but also his toddler sister under some of the most dangerous conditions possible -- a catastrophic war with a horrible famine -- after his mother is killed in an American air raid. There's much work to do, but practically no food.The son does surprisingly well in letting his little sister be a little girl, introducing her to the beauties of nature and the Japanese culture even under the extreme conditions. Two things are lacking -- food and safety. Not all the fireflies are the innocuous insects; some are the small pellets of incendiary thermite that the US Army Air Corps drops upon the wooden buildings that are the norm in Japan. To go further I would have to spoil the movie ending. The animation is excellent, the symbolism is effective, and so far as I can tell, it could only have been an animation. The situation is simply to dangerous for live actors of any age, let alone children, and the destruction necessary to establish the true horror of war and hunger would be violate every ethic. A must-see, a classic anti-war film that puts the lie to the idea that the common Japanese people of World War II were unfeeling automatons who deserved what they got.",9,3,5,2 July 2003
The Last Emperor," Long and well worth every moment
","The last Emperor of China, Pu Yi, we now understand, was never anything more than a puppet. He wielded absolute power within his real realm -- a gilded cage of a palace -- but could never shape events except for tragedy to himself or to others. We see his life as one unlikely person, the one person that one would have most expect to have been insulated, in a gigantic tragedy -- that of China between the chaotic beginning of what might have been a long reign and the destructive Cultural Revolution of Mao, with coups, warlord rule, World War II, and the Marxist Revolution culminating in the rise of Mao. One recognizes that the pathologies of imperial China never truly died, but merely took new forms in the cult of the Leader. That the scenery is beautiful and hedonism among elites is rife hardly conceals the fact that China was a political Hell.Pu Yi, once the Emperor of the great (but decrepit) Chinese Empire, becomes Emperor of the Forbidden Palace in 1912 before he is expelled in one of many violent revolutions (this one in 1925) in China. We see him doing a few things right, like reforming the Palace bureaucracy from a den of thieves into something honorable. He gets a superb adviser in Reginald Johnston, who gave him the confidence to be a political figure -- even a good one -- in the happiest time of his life. Johnston leaves as Pu Yi is expelled from the Palace, and eventually falls under the spell of the Japanese, who rip Manchuria from China and find someone willing to rule it in an enlightened manner -- himself. The Prime Minister of his choosing is killed, and Pu Yi becomes a puppet ruler of a contemptible entity. It's just like the old days, only the intriguers are worse -- far worse. The decrepitude of the system sets in at the first moment. As Emperor he can only accede to what his Japanese overlords demand. At the end of the war he is arrested by the Soviets because he dallies too long on unfinished business -- and after the 1949 Revolution he is sent back to China as a war criminal and traitor. Rather than being executed (as one might expect) he is sent to prison as a convict.As a prisoner he is incarcerated with some of his former underlings -- war criminals of the Manchukuo puppet state -- who have learned to ape the ideology of their captors, and he runs afoul of those 'fellow' inmates. Ex-fascists make the most fervent communists. All in all, he simplifies and becomes a very ordinary man in a society that punished anyone who challenged anything that the regime didn't want people to challenge. Pure puppet? Not quite. A dupe who never left when the going was good -- if the going was ever good -- and that is exactly what the Imperial role made him. In childhood the ruler of the greatest empire (in population size, that is) on Earth -- in a premature old age, a cipher. Then again, what else did most Chinese ever become in China during the first two thirds of the 20th century become -- ciphers, old before their time, wrecks of no fault of their own, just to survive.",8,59,88,12 May 2003
Singin' in the Rain," the definitive musical
","A simple story that pokes fun at every cliché about film stars and the studios for which they work, Singin' in the Rain has lost nothing over time. The dance scenes with are unbeatable, not that one would expect differently with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. The music, even if it isn't original (it all appears in earlier movies -- old ones at the time of this movie's creation) always fits. The premise: the advent of sound in the new 'talking pictures' makes all silent movies obsolete as mass entertainment, and a high-budget project that 'Monumental Pictures' has nearly completed would be a disaster at the box office unless it is turned into a sound movie. Technical difficulties, including the directional requirements of early microphones, the tendencies of microphones to pick up sounds like heart beats that distract from dialogue, and the poor co-ordination of sound and image create their own problems.Even more, the silent-era actors have to relearn how to talk for best effect. With Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) it's almost a lark, and even the pedantics of voice lessons become a set up for a fine musical dance sequence. The potential catastrophe is that Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) has a voice incorrigibly unsuited to sound pictures, a fact good for both comedy and dramatic tension. But she is the great star of the silent era, she has a big salary, overwhelming arrogance, and a big contract. Even worse, she leaves no question to the question that she poses at one point 'What do you think -- that I'm dumb or something'? The solution is to dub the voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) for dialogue and music without Lina 'Am I dumb or somethin'?' Lamont knowing what's going on.So the silent movie is given sound and is even extended with musical and dance numbers. But that's not the whole story, and the sockdolager ending has to be seen to believed. It works!Unless one considers >The Wizard of Oz< a musical even though it is more an adventure story, this is the greatest movie musical of all times and is compelling cinema that everyone must see.",10,1,4,2 July 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Half brilliant, half horrible!
","Stanley Kubrick's reputation of course relies upon other films, and this one is more likely to impress film students for techniques than any audiences most likely to be disappointed when they are drawn into the odd connection between Kubrick and some major movie stars more than thirty years his junior (Cruise and Kidman) who have no other connections to him. I must admit that for the first thirty minutes all I could think was 'What a piece of pretentious rubbish! How could Kubrick soil himself with this?', and then it grew upon me, but not in time to convince me that Kubrick didn't make one film too many (this one) or should have made some other movie as his unintended swan song. The result is mediocrity: half masterful, and half amateurish.As usual for Kubrick, set design is consistently masterful. Enough of this movie grates on me to damage the rest. This is not an early work of a promising filmmaker; this is the last complete work of a decayed master. Perhaps, as with the other master Hitchcock, his taste failed him as he aged. Perhaps he fell in love with a novel that he thought needed a cinematic treatment -- and bit off far more than he could chew. Kubrick moves an expressionist novel set in Germany or Austria across an ocean and nearly a century later in New York City in the 1990s, and he gets some interesting results. Interesting, but not wholly-satisfying. Expressionism, over the top a century ago, is silly today even if recent art has gone even more over the top. First of all, Kubrick's mastery of set design gives a beauty to an ugly story, half pornographic and half a brilliant mystery, and the opulence makes the ugliness of much of the behavior all the more troublesome. The chilly personas of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (and this is deliberate) underscore the ominous qualities of the film.I find the short, and potentially deadly, excursion of the clinical Dr. Hartford (Cruise) into the secret (Satanist?) ceremony by overhearing a password a bit contrived. Then again, expressionism itself is obsolete because it is contrived; what was over the top then is what alienated risk-seekers search almost routinely.Kubrick took a chance, and this one spun out of control. For good reason Expressionism did not become more than a cultural fad, dying out about twenty years after its introduction.",6,0,1,11 May 2004
Hoosiers," Basketball is only the cover...
","In Hoosiers, one gets a view of 'flyover' country -- the part of America that people get through quickly on the way to somewhere else. Small-town life isn't as simple as it looks from urban America, and it wasn't very simple even in the 1950s. Human relationships are as complicated and intense in rural America as they are anywhere else. Just because few people are around doesn't mean that they can't get in one's face (to use an anachronistic term); one can't hide from any personal conflicts that arise from trying to do things differently, and one can't even get away from the town drunk. What is there is there, and one challenges other people's sensibilities and habits at considerable risk to one's happiness in such a place. Small towns allow privacy only at the price of all intimacy, and intimacy only at the price of all individuality. Trust me on this -- I live in a small town just outside of Indiana. Hoosiers gets the visual feel of rural America in the 1950s, specifically Indiana, very well. It's apparent that the cinematography exploits the changing seasons of the Midwest as beautifully as can be done, rivaling Alfred Hitchcock's >The Trouble with Harry< (to be sure a very different movie) in part because preparation for basketball season begins in the fall and that basketball ends as winter gives way to the ugly, nasty time of early spring.The sets are real high schools -- available cheaply because many school districts have abandoned high school buildings once a new, more modern high school has been built. (A little secret about Indiana -- the public buildings of a certain age in rural Indiana are essentially identical in Indiana for each type because such buildings all have the same architectural plan). The basketball sequences are almost hackneyed. How much variety can one get out of winning, even by setting the scene thirty years (now fifty) years earlier)? Basketball is the pretext for personal conflicts -- such as the coach's ideas of how to win and the ideas of the supposed experts in town and that between the coach and the English teacher, who wants the star basketball player to seek an academic scholarship (requiring him to give up basketball) instead of a basketball scholarship, even though basketball is the surest source of lasting esteem in a small town that offers few economic opportunities other than working on the family farm and waiting to inherit the farm when Dear Old Dad dies. Most of all, we have conflict between characters and their worst tendencies -- selfishness, low self-esteem, alcoholism, and anger. Hoosiers is a great movie, one of the best (better than, for example, >Field Dreams<, even if it falls short of >Raging Bull>) of involving sports, because human drama overpowers the sport. Thoroughly unpretentious, it catches rural Midwestern reality very well. It is neither saccharine nor maudlin, and it doesn't require that one be a basketball fan or to have much knowledge about basketball.",8,0,0,6 May 2003
Jaws," Exploiting the Ultimate Fear
","Jaws exploits the most primal fear that any creature can have: sudden, excruciating, inescapable death by a creature that sees one as nothing more than meat. We think that we are at the apex of the food chain, a creature that most others fear. Even the dog, the animal that most intimately knows us and our vulnerabilities recognizes us as a better food source alive than dead -- but woe is it to something that threatens that food source! Think of the Dobermans in 'The Boys From Brazil' who dispatch a nazi war criminal in a particularly well-deserved manner.The people that 'Jaws' kills aren't so guilty. They just happen to meet a very large, hungry, rogue shark -- the sort that sees humans in the water as meat. The tables are turned, and Man is deposed from what his throne as the biggest, baddest predator since T-Rex. If that isn't scary, then what is?This is a very gory movie. The closest parallel is Hitchcock's 'Psycho' in which a crazy man becomes an animalistic killer, someone out of control of his impulses, who must kill because it is his nature. 'Jaws' has more explicit killing, with human body parts left behind and great amounts of blood. The setting is so much different from the dry land of Arizona and the Central Valley of California that one cannot see a ripoff of Hitchcock. Like 'Psycho' this is a relatively low-budget film -- but just as Hitchcock did with 'Psycho', Spielberg did everything right.This movie is not for the faint of heart. Neither are the crude ripoffs involving tigers, killer whales, octopuses(?), piranhas, snakes, bears, and crocodilians. The ripoffs are simply cheesy flicks that would have been best unmade. This is the original and the unsurpassable best as a movie whose basis is the primal fear of becoming dinner for a big predator.Biological impropriety knocks off a '1' on my rating... to a '9'. 'Psycho' gets a '10'.",9,1,3,21 November 2003
The Producers," What could possibly go right?
","Max Bialystok (Zero Mostel), a producer of musicals who has lost his knack and is living on his illusions, gets some odd tax advice from his accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder): that although the IRS audits successful plays with a fine tooth comb, it ignores flops. Bialystok, who can no longer succeed in producing successful musical comedies, gets the inspiration to produce the worst musical ever, oversell the production to little old ladies willing to make investments in his plays after he seduces them, keep the investment, and have the money that he still needs for his self esteem. Bloom, until then a thoroughly-repressed and neurotic accountant, agrees and becomes a partner.Of course everything must fail. The music must be awful, the plot must stink, the set design must be dreadful, and the story must be offensive. So he finds the worst director, the worst choreographer to create incompetent dance scenes, the worst set designer to create a tasteless set, the worst performers possible, and above all the worst stage play available. And the worst stage play ever written is the incredibly tasteless 'Springtime for Hitler', penned by an unrepentant nazi (Kenneth Mars) as a romp in the Third Reich for the 'lovable' clique of Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, and all the other sordid characters that 'Franz Liebkind', the nutty Nazi, loves to the time.But Bialystok and Bloom, both obviously Jewish, have to 'seduce' the crazy nazi into believing that they have empathy with Liebkind's desire to express his love for the Fuehrer and his cause, even to the point of wearing swastika armbands that they despise in his presence.The casting for a 'Hitler' finds a hippie-like actor who can't hold a tune or even make sense. The play, above all, is to have its premiere in New York City, a place where one would expect an audience only slightly less sympathetic to Nazis than Tel Aviv.Bialystok tries to offend the critics by offering a small bribe small enough to insult the critic. The play opens with anticlimax with stale music, bad lyrics, and an incompetent dance scene. Some dancers have tasteless headdresses (including a beer stein and a pretzel). The introductory dance scene incorporates the goose step and in the end a salute with artillery.Nothing could be a more certain failure -- but it SUCCEEDS! Then the comedy soars, with incredible consequences that result in big trouble for people that we have every cause to loathe.For more, see this romp of a comedy of unintended consequences for Bialystok, Bloom, and Liebkind.",8,1,1,20 June 2006
The Truman Show," Kafka-esque tale of the sham of contrived 'reality TV'
","How much of an illusion of reality can one create, even with the unlimited resources of a profitable TV enterprise? A TV producer, one 'Christof', devises the most artificial environment possible must seem real -- indeed the only possible reality -- for Truman Burbank, whose life is a TV show, and every scene is a stage, and every person is an actor except him, the ultimate fool, from his birth nearly thirty years earlier. Truman Burbank must have the illusion of complete freedom, but he can't have it. He must also have the delusions of privacy and the genuineness of all of those in on the 24-7-365 scam. If he ever figured it all out, he'd go insane from the absurdity of the situation.All is beautiful, and everything is a set-up... even his 'love interests' who must be in on the plot to delude him into thinking that there is but one accessible reality -- a world in which everything is a sham, if a pleasant one. Truman has been part of a 24-hour TV show, the ultimate reality program, now in its 10,909th straight day... and knows nothing else. He's beginning to chafe in a world in which he has been 'legally adopted at birth by a corporation', an enterprise created by one 'Christof', a TV producer. Everything depends upon Truman Burbank staying right where he is, in an unreal set-up. If you enjoyed the old British TV series 'The Prisoner', then you will enjoy this too as an intensification. This is a brainy movie, not so much a blockbuster as a Kafka-esque or at least Serling-esque tale.",8,0,0,11 January 2004
Contact," Unpretentious and effective
","For sci-fi, this is brainy (what would one expect from the late Carl Sagan?), clever, humorous, coherent, and family-friendly. The pretext is that we have gotten signals from life out in space -- life that has gotten the worst possible introduction from humanity, an early television signal from the Third Reich (nazi Germany, of course). Humanity gets plans for a machine that can supposedly get people elsewhere in the universe... a sort of Heaven.To be sure, I am not convinced that the machine so much gets people to the Other Side and doesn't create the illusion by analyzing the thoughts of its 'passengers' -- but the ambiguity looks intentional.The satire of anti-rational religious figures, UFO cultists, political extremists, and the like is exactly as one would expect from Sagan, someone who long told us that space travel to the stars would be so difficult that it might not be worth the effort. Science and technology, in contrast, offer awe and beauty just as Sagan said that they would.",7,1,4,3 July 2006
The Birds," Scary, yet beautiful assault on human smugness about nature
","-The Birds- is one of two great animal-attack films; the other is, of course, -Jaws-, a very different movie. -The Birds- and -Jaws- are the only truly good movies of a genre that easily degenerates into pure schlock, exploitative, low-budget fare with bad scripts and dreadful acting. The two masterpieces of terror by animal assault the human conceit that 'we' own the world. The third best is the merely 'good' -Them-, whose overgrown ants do their predation on a bigger scale -- our scale -- than their usual world. We may hold the land; the birds own the skies, and they can be anywhere. Only because of their small size are they generally harmless, but if they ever ganged up on us we humans would be in big trouble.DuMaurier and Hitchcock exploit such a primal fear by turning the tables on us, exploiting our primal fear of sudden, horrifying death from animals striking from above, recalling our monkey-like ancestors who had cause to dread the lethal strike of beak and talon of a hawk or eagle. The birds have gotten organized, and they have chosen to take back their world. Unlike the shark that one never sees striking from dark aquatic depths, we see the birds coming and we fail to believe that they can do anything to us. Plausible? Not really. At least it's well done, and that is all that we can expect, with the superb cinematography that one would expect from the great Hitch. It's second-rate Hitchcock, but second-rate Hitchcock is better than first-rate work of almost anyone else. This is the only horror film from him in which nature provides such terror. Aside from the original -Jaws- (which I think owes more to -Psycho- than to -The Birds- ), and -Them- (with the overgrown ants that result from irradiation that destroys the controls upon their growth), this is the only animal-attack movie to have cinematic worth.",8,0,0,15 June 2004
