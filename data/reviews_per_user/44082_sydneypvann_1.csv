10 Cloverfield Lane," Excellent
",I have never written a review or even thought about it. This is the first movie I've seen in a very long time that kept me on the edge of my seat. I was bored looking for a movie. Saw John Goodman and decided to watch. I am seriously recommending this movie to everyone I know. You could never predict the outcome.,10,2,2,10 October 2017
