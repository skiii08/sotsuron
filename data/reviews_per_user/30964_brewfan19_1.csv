Hereditary," Believe the hype
","Highly hyped and acclaimed films often result in disappointment, especially of the horror variety. The Witch and It Follows are two examples of such movies. Hereditary, though, delivers with a disturbing plot, outstanding performances from everyone involved, and haunting images that will leave you lying awake at night pondering what could happen to you next. This is a modern day horror masterpiece.",9,36,76,14 June 2018
