It," Scariest but also Inspiring
","Wowww, Wowww, Wowww. I can't stop saying this. I am a big fan of horror movies and really very scared of clowns. Now this movie in which demon takes the appearance of a clown scares me the most. I consider it as my favorite horror movie. It is scariest but at the same time, it also teaches the power of friendship, unity and brotherhood. Acting of Bill Skarsg√•rd as Pennywise is so good, direction is awesome and some scenes are really impressive. It is worth watch movie for horror movie lovers. #IT #Pennywise #Horror #TBT",10,2,3,11 October 2017
The Danish Girl," True Essence of Love
","If you don't know the plot and even don't intend to then this review is for you. This movie shows how beautifully the love can be represented. I just want to say the one word for this movie and that is 'AWESOME'. I watched this movie at 3 am and my eyes were crying to sleep but this movie just trapped me in its emotions which was the result of the flawless representation and natural acting of the superb actors.
Portrayal of real characters is as it must be(advice for the people who said that Eddie Redmayne did not do true judgement with the character) and what to say about Alicia Vikandar, I was internally in love with her while watching the movie. Her expressions and dialogue-delivery just revive the real Gerda Wegenar.
Shooting locations are so impressive. It is a beautiful movie. It also contain some nude scenes but there is no sex. Those scenes are the demand of the depiction of the story. Some scene indirectly represents the feelings of Einar Wegener(Lead Male/Female(You will understand after watching the movie) character).Let us see you can feel them or not(I am hinting 'Creation of a painting so many times').
If you are really interested in watching a master-piece emotional drama and did not have any hatred for non-straight persons then this movie is specially created to invest your precious time in it.",9,0,1,16 January 2018
Inside Out," Inspiring and Entertaining
","I love this movie so much. It gives a very different aspect of thinking about your emotions in your mind. It is represented in a very entertaining but inspiring manner. It shows how every emotion is important to our life. So I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie which teaches us love, real love.",9,9,20,20 September 2017
Coco," Best of its Genre, Inspirational, Loving and Splendid
","Do you know the limits of any animated emotional movie which is gonna release in the future?? It's this...COCO. It is awarded an Oscar in 2018 for best animated movie and after watching, I feel that it is totally worth of it. First come to the title..Woww..Simple but take a whole peep into the true soul of the movie. First you think that movie is going into wrong direction form its title but this is not the case. The whole plot revolves around it.
Now tell some story without spoiling it..There is a child who help his great grand mother not to forget her father who had left her due to make his career in music and now he is in some kind of spiritual world. Yeah, this seems so simple but believe me, it is not. How beautifully the whole plot is presented with the essence of emotions of love and honesty, it is remarkable.
You will completely be trapped with the silent sparkle of this movie and it is also the effect of the melodious songs when they just appear at the right moment. I was left with tears on the climax scene. Human is a social animal and if you are then this movie is just created for you to spread love with your skills of showing affection by being loyal and dedicated to your family. I am sure that you will not regret after getting this mesmerizing cinematic experience .",10,0,1,16 March 2018
