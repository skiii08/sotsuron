Antz," Curse words inappropriate
",I felt it was totally inappropriate for curse words to be in a children's movie.  I watched this movie with my nephew and was outraged that there was foul and inappropriate language in this movie.  It was advertised as a kids movie and  I was very offended by the language used.  I have told numerous people not to let their children watch it. Joy,Null,0,0,12 April 1999
