Child 44," Fractally inept
","This movie was fractally inept, from the smallest detail to the biggest concept. The script and director must think its an accomplishment to keep the audience confused. No, confusion is the natural human condition. What is rare is clarity. I despised this movie from the beginning, when it was obvious that they used the Law and Order: Criminal Intent opening. This is where you string as many completely unrelated vignettes together because you are too incompetent to tell a story. Lets torture the audience, like some teen-tease. I remember checking the progress bar at 18 minutes, thinking that at least the movie had begun. I was wrong, it was more like three movies.While USSR was no paradise in 1953, I have to believe the portrait painted by the book author of total repression represented his homosexual orientation. Yeah, USSR was probably pretty repressive if you were gay. That is wrong and bad, but don't portray every aspect of society as that repressive to everyone from farmers to MGB officers. As the Russian commentator noted here, even by 1953 the USSR was getting less totalitarian. Stalin died in 1953.The movie was like a dramatization of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood but mixed in with portraits of Waco, Ruby Ridge, the McCarthy hearings, and the Mi Lai massacre. Its as if the movie cherry-picked every horror and excess of the USSR and then painted it as everyday life.Confusion. Boy oh boy will you be confused. There is a reviewers here that thinks Gary Oldman was the father that adopted Tom Hardy. Another does not think the assassinated farmers were hiding the political prisoner. I have never watched a movie where the editing was so inept that I would be expecting the resolution of some vignette, and pop, I was in a completely different place with different characters maybe at a different place in the timeline. This may have been because the self-indulgent director shot a 4-hour movie and the editor had to smoosh it into a still-too-long 2 hours and 17 minutes.And the director delights in confusion. Hey, lets have the big mano-a-mano climax be mud wrestling where we can't tell anybody apart. And lets use a lot of Jason Bourne shaky-cam so it is really impossible to know what is going on. Its just the feelings we convey, to show all the characters are confused too. Watch the director commentary of Amadeus where Milos Forman agonizes if his opening scene is clear enough for the audience to know what is going on.In addition to the incompetent editing and script and direction, the fake accents do grate a little. Otherwise the actors were A-list, as you would expect. That fakeness was not helped by wild implausibility. Even in 1953 USSR, heck, especially in 1953 USSR, does anyone really think a mid-level MGB officer can shoot a subordinate in the back, in his office no-less? I know the book author hated the USSR, but do we really believe that the law enforcement apparatus would suppress murders because its the hallmark of an 'imperfect society? Read the Wikipedia entry on Andrei Chikatilo, the real serial killer this movie appropriates. The Russians had 15 prosecutors and 29 detectives on the case. The investigation did implicate innocent people, but that happens in the US every single day. The investigation also solved 1000 unrelated crimes, including rapes and murders. Sure, you could say that was in 1985 USSR, but its not like the 1950s could have been that much different in the attitude towards crime.Another major implausibility is the relationship to the wife. She loves you, she hates you, she cons you, she betrays you, she stands by you. Its like being married to the Magic 8-Ball. You never know what's going to turn up. Sorry, not based on any reality I have ever seen. Sneaky snarky scumbags stay that way. Oh, and back to confusion, how about when Hardy shows up at some parent's apartment. I thought they were her parents, since, ta da, he was an orphan. But no, the Amazing Kreskin tapped us on the forehead and with no warning or foreshadowing, we are expected to know they are his adoptive parents.The main conflict here is really office politics. Spy agencies are full of passive-aggressives. they don't go around shooting each other or defenseless Kulaks at the drop of a hat.Sadly there is no way to fix this mess. Its what economists call a dead-weight loss. You could give the book to the Russians that made Stalingrad (1990), and even they could not coax a good believable story out of this.OK, who can resist? First, when writing about a mass murderer and serial killer, lets make the main conflict being with him (or her if you want an Oscar). Sure keep it in 1953 USSR, but factually show the hope for the future and changes as Stalin dies. Rather than some goofy spy agency fallen angel, lets have it be a prosecutor, like actually happened in real-life. Lets have Hardy be glad that the totalitarian state is in decline, but the only way he gets closer to solving the crime is by going all Andy Sipowicz NYPD Blue on the suspects. This will let us wonder why humans always resort to violence and repression to get what we really really want.A nice art-house film disguised as a police procedural. The society gets less repressive as the hero gets more repressive. The crazy killer goes down, so how do we really feel about that? Easy 85 million domestic gross, with great foreign box office. There will always be the action figures and product placements to make this a real home run. People that read the book will be appalled, but there are so few of them, it really does not matter.",Null,1,3,17 April 2017
Gravity," Very good, but not great
","This is a very good movie. It deserved every one of the technical awards. Sandra Bullock deserved her Oscar nomination. What I find as fascinating as the movie is the number of 1-star reviews here, and how a certain group of people, us techie types, seem to hate this flick.The movie does have two huge flaws, one dramatic, and one technical. The dramatic flaw is the scene where Sandra is coiled up like a fetus. If I was in the theater I would have stood up, pointed at the screen, swiveled my head back and said, 'Look everybody, its Symbolism!' It was heavy-handed and inappropriate. It reminded me of that review of Snow Falling on Cedars, where the guy said he wanted to stand up and shout, 'OK, we get it!' Worse yet, Sandra had just promised George Clooney she was coming back for him, and she is doing this little curl-up diorama. The audience is screaming-- 'Hey darling, George is out there drifting away and dying of oxygen starvation!' People that almost die don't pause for a peaceful respite. They claw around and tremble from the adrenaline rush. The only thing worse would be if she found some scrap of a mirror and started touching up her makeup. I fault the studio here. They could have snipped this self-indulgent bit out. But like often happens, that which was expensive or hard to do gets kept, simply since it was expensive and hard to shoot.The technical error is George Clooney drifting away after unhitching his lanyard. Sorry, there is some elasticity in the parachute cords, but it sure looked like they were both stopped. George would not have gone anywhere.Those minor niggles aside, there is a reason this big-budget movie made back it financing double in the USA alone, and seven times return world-wide. Its a very good movie. I think the reason so many of us techie types hated it is that they thought there were going to see a science fiction movie, and this is not science fiction. Its an art film. It odd how the people that want to see make-believe BS with transporters and photon torpedoes also try to criticize the plausibility of this movie to explain their hatred.Mostly they are wrong. The guy that says the Hubble is in geosynchronous orbit away from the ISS. No, its in low-Earth orbit. The guy (its always guys) that says she would have died breathing 'pure CO2.' No, she had an alert for high CO2. Over a few percent and CO2 turns into carbolic acid in your lungs and starts to kill you. The guy that said capsules land in the water and would not have sunk. No, Russian capsules land on earth, and even the USA lost a Mercury capsule when it sank.Then there were guys that criticized Bullock, saying she was emotionally damaged and could not have gotten in the program. Nothing she did indicated she was totality screwed up from her kid dying, that came out in dialog as back-story. They despise her for playing enie meanee mo, but the movie makes clear the Chinese capsule is the exact same layout as the Russian one, and she is only trying to remember what she did 10 minutes prior. I loved the guy (its always a guy) that says the Chinese ship would have a setting you could change to make the buttons English. Dude, they are clear plastic with silk-screened characters, not 100 tiny LCD screens. Others say she was a bimbo for crashing the simulator. Dudes, there are military flight people and a science crew on the Shuttle. They don't expect the science types to be flight experts, that is part of the suspense. Speaking of suspense, how about the guy that says there is no suspense because we _know_ that there will be another debris storm in 90 minutes. Dude, that is what creates the suspense, are you completely broken as a human being? And all his fellow experts that say the debris incident would be impossible. They did not watch the special features that explains the Kessler syndrome, did they? The only way Cuar√≥n could get us techie types on board is to switch the roles so that Bullock floats off and dies. We don't hate women, but they confuse us and that just adds to the lack of empathy we 'on the spectrum' feel for other humans. Better yet, indulge our OCD and replace Bullock with Patrick Stewart. No girls and a Star Trek prequel, that's the ticket.The criticisms of this movie profoundly increased my respect for Gene Roddenberry. He did not invent Star Trek, he discovered it. The perfect food for the Asperger mind. All the tech types who demand anything in space be science fiction also demand Roddenberry's universe. Girls as minor characters, or fluff-babe sex objects for Kirk. Exploration, not reaction to events--- like playing Dungeons and Dragons. Lots of fighting and war, like a first-person shooter. Make-believe BS, like transporters and glowing wormhole intestines that poop you out in a different galaxy. It has to be an extension of comic book story-telling. Indulge our ADHD with a different episode every week, but pander to our OCD by keeping characters and situations the same.So my apologies Se√±or Cuar√≥n, for all us tech types who excoriated your movie. My favorite comment was the guy that said 'The director was not emotionality involved.' Watch the special features DVD, you blithering buffoon. If you don't want the haters Se√±or, you will have to make movies that combine Dungeons and Dragons with a first-person shooter. I see many action movies that are already just FPS episodes. Now those have no plot, unlike your films. Perhaps you can make a film that projects to the future where us Asperger types are the Morlocks and you neurotypicals are the Eloi. I would pay to see that vision, for sure.",8,2,4,23 January 2016
Midnight in Paris," Thought provoking
","I watched Total Recall (2012) last night. You could make a colorable argument that it is the stupidest movie ever made. So watching this today almost gave me whiplash, since it is such a thought-provoking flick.It might not be the thoughts Woody wants. I see it as Woody trying to apologize for cynicism and negatively his whole life. Then again, maybe he went to France to meet Roman Polanski and get some 12-year-old girls. Hard to say.I find it amusing, Woody's smugness, when he criticizes Hollywood for only caring about dinner and movies. (I do think the LA Times should be divided into those two sections, just for convenience.) It seems the only thing Woody has more contempt for than Hollywood is businessmen. What a hackneyed Marxist college professor outlook on life. Welcome to Woody's world, set your watch back 40 years. No wonder he is fixated on the past.It was appropriate that Woody showed the Versailles, since his Marie Antoinette attitude was so prevalent. He must miss Greenwich Village, now all gentrified. Being way more provincial than he would admit, Woody can't see all the hip artists are in Branson Missouri, watching Yakov Smirnoff and being the same drunken bums artists they have been for centuries, if not millennia.It was fun to pause the movie and look people up. I knew of Gertrude Stien, but a little Wikipedia and I can see she was a Bay Area trust fund baby, kinda like the Grateful Dead. She could afford to not have a job and buy paintings from the whole coterie of bums that swarmed around her like bees to honey. Remember, to these bums of magnificent commitment, what we call a 'salon' was to them a warm room, and maybe some free booze.Like I said, it is a thoughtful movie. So I got to thinking about this dynamic: rich idle people, who any good Marxist should hate, except they are bum magnets for a bunch of dipsomaniac artist types. And how the art is a fusion, a very capitalist fusion, of those rich patron's expectations and the kind of long-con BS that a bunch of brain-damaged dope fiends can whip up on short notice with minimal effort. Before long, voil√†, Rothko. But of course, there is also a lot of good art that comes out of this patronage. It will be interesting to see what comes out of Branson and Taos and all the other cheap places where bum artistes can afford to live.Woody would hate the analogy, but you can see Hollywood as the rich trust fund Gertrude Stein, and see the equally capitalistic exploits produced by the hordes of very good and very bad artistes it attracts.So other than the bits of New York smug, this is a very lovely movie. It's drop-dead gorgeous, Deakins-quality cinematography. I am delighted it made so much money, since Woody needs to learn being a cynic is really no fun, and the cheapest form of smugness and condescension.",8,0,0,5 November 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Better than Ambien
","Watching the DVD put me asleep in 20 minutes. Thankfully the IMDb reviews tipped me that the movie is incomprehensible without reading the book and watching the 1979 mini-series 4 or 5 times. Its a spy thriller that you can only appreciate if you already know the ending. Read the Wikipedia plot summary. And blog posts,(tinker-tailor-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/). Be sure to turn on closed captioning. They will put the name of the speaker in parentheses on occasion so you can figure out who the heck is talking.Every time I read a spoiler I was amazed at how how sloppily the film was put together. No, I did not notice the sign for Bidabesto n the subway wall since there were a couple walking down the stares and the gal had a big floppy afro and that got me thinking how she got cast and if hair like that is hard to care for and how it looked silly flopping as she descended the stairs.Just like there were always some Indians that lived near the fort, there are always some fan-boys that think its great you have to have read the books and watch the 1979 miniseries. Heck, even the director notes you should listen to his commentary in order to understand what is going on. His tone told me there were recording the commentary after the theatrical release where everyone was staggering out the theater asking 'WTF just happened, I want my money back.' Listen to Milos Forman commentary at the beginning of Amadeus, where he beats himself up worrying that audience will not understand who the guy running across the courtyard is. Read about Hitchcock arguing with Carry Grant, who did not 'feel' his character would look across the street when he exited a building. Hitchcock exploded, 'Its because I want the audience to understand what building is across the street!' A director's first duty is to clarity, not the narcissism of the actors or the autism of the writer. He serves the viewer, rather than condescend to us that we are so stupid we cannot understand his masterpiece.The Wikipeda plot summary shows you this really is a simple plot. There is not a lot of stuff going on, once you take out the self-indulgent peacocking of having to watch files being lifted in a little dumbwaiter. There are two activating events, a botched defection in Budapest and a blown cover in gosh knows what city where a some British dolts get killed and a Russian traitor girl gets kidnapped. Needless to say, these don't come at the beginning of the movie since that would make sense. There are handfuls of flashbacks, but you can tease out the change-- when Oldman is staring into space one minute, and then he is somewhere else the next second, well Elmer, that thar is a flashback. The thing is there is so little context for any scene transitions, you get lost and everything is a blur.That lack of context is telling. See, I am sure le Carr√© is autistic. He pretty much admits it, talking about his social awkwardness in the featurette. Having worked in tech for decades, and being pretty far up the spectrum myself, I can see how le Carr√© loves to dive into details, but stitching things together-- not so much. The books offer up a flood of semi-relevant details, so that critics read their own deep profound interpretations. Another Asperger feature is the lack of context. People like le Carr√© and myself just assume you know every single thing we know, and that you have had the exact same life experiences, and that like Ayne Rand, if you don't like Strauss and tap dancing, you are a worthless idiot.Autism is fine for a novel. le Carr√© just churned out a torrent of words. You can flip back and forth in the books. He eventually reached coverage and connected the details together. I am sure his editor did yeoman's work trying to get a comprehensible story written down.Now we come to this movie, and rather than feel sorry for a fellow Aspergiac like le Carr√©, I have to feel the director is just f*&ing with my head, like Thurman Murman was doing to Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa. I remember way into the movie thinking 'Who the heck is Alleline?' And then a quick trip to the IMDb listing and I realize, 'Oh, they mean Percy.' Introducing people by first name and then switching to surname is a stupidity that they do in the series Vera, and all the more reason to have your 12-year-old daughter writing down the characters and plot points on a 8' x 12' white board you have rolled up next to your recliner. Maybe force her to read the book too-- 'No daddy, its so booooooring!' OK, too many details and no context, and a director who might be a narcissist sociopath since he like making moves only the chosen few can understand. Why he is so special, you should welcome spending 90 dollars to see the movie 9 times. But adding to this is the implausibility of the plot, and how Oldman catches the bad guy. None of this rings true, and looks like the fever dream of a clerk typist in MI6 that dreams of what real spies must be doing.On top of that is the dreariness. It looks like they were shooting in Pompey after the pyroclastic ash cloud. Everything gray and dirty and depressing. When I watched the commentary track, I had a Mrs Fisher Murder Mystery episode playing without sound on the second TV. Quite the contrast. This film was just ugly, everything about it, plot, characterization, cinematography, is ugly. Glad I got the DVD for free from the library. And do get the DVD or unlimited streaming, you will need a few watches if you have not read the book.",4,2,6,8 October 2016
The Hateful Eight," Unrealistic and self-indulgent
","I have to believe this was written under the influence of methamphetamine. There surely was no research influencing it, not even a trip to the dude ranch in Modern Family where Delmar could have schooled Quentin in the the postmodern Hollywood perceptions of the authentic West.Its OK that Quentin was the rotten little boy in Junior High School, sitting in the back row, cupping his face into his hands and making fart noises. Its just that most of us grow out of that class-clown attention-whore phase around 9th grade. I am pretty sure that it is the same little boy repeating the N-word a hundred times, with his little prick sadistic grin, claiming its art and he is exposing racism. Hey, watch '42' if you want to see racism, this is faux-provocative tripe.The movie is way too long. What could be a word is a sentence. What could be a sentence is paragraph. What could be a paragraph is a page, and what could be a page is a chapter. We get it QT, stop condescending.The movie is completely unbelievable. Maybe people behave this way in meth-fueled Platonic Hollywood elitist fever dreams, but not in any planet we inhabit. First of, unlike Hollywood, criminals do not like stress or tension anymore than the rest of us. They would have waylaid the stage and blown off Kurt Russell's head, rather than do a long involved ridiculous mass murder with more moving parts that the Space Shuttle. It was Mad Magazine in the 1970s that showed Hollywood perception was a shoot-out in the street at high noon, while the reality was a shotgun to the back of the head at 4AM as the guy left the saloon.Kurt would not be keeping his lady prisoner alive for the hangman. That is absurd. In the winter he would have killed her in an instant since the cold would keep her from smelling on the trip to Red Rock. He would have raped her first, bad teeth or no, she was pretty cute.The people were all cartoon characters as well. First off, not even the Wizard of the KKK would call a black man the N-word to his face, when said black man has two .44 caliber pistols stuffed in his belt. What was Dr. King's expression-- 'pernicious racism'? It would have been far more effective to have a character 'slip' and say the N-word, only to apologize profusely. That is pernicious racism. This 14-year old neener neener name-calling is pathetic.The cabin is way too big-- they didn't have the lumber nor the Trane forced-air furnace in post Civil War Wyoming. It should have been the size of a stage, but that would remind us this should be a play. Summer stock at best.Others have noted all the modern words and expressions, just something else to remind us that every single word in the movie is a lie, including 'the,' 'and,' and 'but.' Having hung around the mob and some outlaw bikers, I can assure you that no ass-clown is going to sashay into the clubhouse and start taking people's guns. The allure and beauty of the West is the equality conferred by a gun on your side. Kurt's only option would be to wait out the storm in the barn.The very Western hardness QT is trying to portray makes it unlikely that some brother is going to stage this complex fiasco out of filial love. Equally unlikely is his gang cronies coming along, when there is no direct financial benefit to them. They would have skedaddled to Mexico a month ago. It would be far more plausible if the gal knew where the loot was buried, and that is why they were trying to save her.The gang-leader importuning patience. Maybe for a boring movie, but in real life criminals have no patience, that is why they are criminals. Otherwise they would be working for Wells Fargo and contributing to their pension plans.Pistols. Nobody with any experience would want to have a pistol in a gunfight. The 12-gauge with 00 buckshot is far preferred. Concealing guns under tables and chairs-- puleeze-- how many things do they want to risk going wrong? Criminals are stupid and impatient, this scheming is completely out of character.Major spoiler, detailed synopsis: Talk talk talk; talk talk; talk talk talk talk. Interracial sodomy rape. Boom. Boom boom boom boom. Boom boom boom boom boom. Roll credits.The acting was magnificent-- which is what fools some people into thinking this is a good movie. Music was OK, don't know why it got an Oscar. Cinematography was superb as well.",5,4,9,20 December 2016
Interstellar," Good actors, bad movie
","I loved Gravity, since it was an exploration of human drama. I loved the Star Trek remake since it JJ is pretty dang good, and it was all make-believe and whizzy. I hated this movie. There were respites. When Matthew McConaughey's said 'I could fly around that neutron star.' I burst out laughing, it was so preposterous, so absurd and so lame. I will admit, he sold the line. If he can pretend to be imaginary people and lie so effectively, it makes me worry about politicians and my friends.It really scares me that Nolan thinks this movie makes any sense. Has his brain turned to Yorkshire pudding? It was written as a series of dramatic expedients. Like Chris just had to have a dust-bowl, so there was a dust-bowl. And Chris just had to have a big ol' rocket launch. There had to be wormholes and time travel and sinking to the level of M. Night Shyamalan, a twist at the end.Another annoyance is Nolan's British elitism, that farmers are dumb peons that don't need to go to college. Note how Coop loves his troubled intellectual daughter and not the son that ends up feeding the planet.Even with these great actors, the situations were so preposterous it was impossible to feel anything but pity for the agents that got them into this mess. A near-future dystopia, where there are cars and trucks but not phones or letters or internet. No government, but no MS13, Hell's Angels and Mafioso raping your daughter. The occasional pervasive dust storm. But the crops grow OK. Until they don't. And somehow we know the planet is doomed, if only because some jerk says it is.There is a huge NASA installation a few hours drive away, but nobody knows about it. Coop sends co-ordinates so he knows it is there. Nolan might want to ask Kip the science guy about causality and determinism. No government, no gasoline, but we have NASA and suspended animation since Nolan needs that little plot trick. Its a drive-by script-- spray some more clich√©s at it until they call you a genius.And folks, you can't drive into a black hole. Its not black because its mysterious and can be used for incredibility stupid plot tricks. Its black because it rips everything into elementary particles and then perhaps super-strings. There is no daddy's little time-travel library of earthy delights inside a black hole.This could have been OK, it could have been Mad Max crossed with Groundhog Day. Instead, it is just mush, good to keep infants amused with pretty colors and motion, but complete nonsensical mush for adults. Matt Damon was lucky to get blown out into empty space in that little plot clich√©. I felt more empathy for the creature in Aliens getting blown into space than I did for Matt.To recap the 7 places in the movie: Home life--BS situation, BS character interaction. Space central- BS situation, BS characters. Space ship, BS situation, BS characters. Planet one- BS situation. Planet two-- BS situation, BS character, BS interaction. Black hole-- BS everything, and I mean every single thing. Planet 3, BS trite. Home again-- BS situations, BS characters, BS interaction.Please studio heads and finance people stop indulging this madman with his infantile fantasies. Even Lord of the Rings was better than this.At this point I usually imagine how I would save the film. Its not re-shoots, every single scene and every single line is stupid, there is nothing here to save. OK, I have calmed down and I can no more give up on a crappy movie than on a baby drowning in a swimming pool. So, add the roving Mad Max gangs that rip him off and pillage and steal. Then they come for his daughter. The NASA installation is not some secret, its where they have been launching the Skynet robots to control us all, right before things collapsed. So Coop takes his little girl, and commandeers a spacecraft. We need the gal, and the black guy but not the other white guy-- what ever happened to him anyway--- Oh, he drowned in Waterworld. I assume he is some famous high-dollar actor, save the money for special effects. OK, now when I saw the cool black guy, I muttered 'He's as good as dead' and sure enough, like all cool black guys in every science fiction movie, he died. So lets go against the grain and promise that no matter what, the cool black guy lives. Cut out Waterworld, we already lost the dufus white guy that drowned there. Cut out the black hole-- it is absurd, stupid and insults our intelligence. Cut out the third planet, this script is too complicated as it is.No, they fly to the Matt Damon planet and yeah, he can be a creep. OK, now we have the making of a third act. It revolves around who the women will pick to mate with. Daddy's little girl has grown up, and that science gal is pretty hot as well. I leave it to you to select the ending: 1) The black guy ends up with both of the gals, bless him, and maybe pimps them out (cliche alert). 2) Matt ends up with the daughter, and he beats her and is a drunk (hillbilly heaven). 3) Matthew ends up with his own daughter, since their relationship seemed unhealthy anyway. 4) There are three guys and two gals so pick the guy that ends up alone. 5) The two gals go carpet muncher and leave all the guys in the cold, human race dies. 6) Any two guys being gay leaves both gals for the other guy, unless #5). 7) The Strangelove prodigious breeding ending, where all the guys jump both girls over and over and over and over and over.... well, you get the idea.",3,4,6,8 February 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," Technically, dramatically, and artistically flawed
","The last chase (I hope) is playing out as I write this--- typing is more enjoyable than getting sea sick watching this meth-cam production. But reading the 'hated it' comments gave me another really great comment-- the person that said 'Get a tripod and some lights'. That ranks as one of my favorite comments, up there with 'This is what happens when your mother owns a production company' for Dungeons and Dragons and 'We get it!' for Snow Falling on Cedars. Sure the camera work is abominable--I would have had to leave the theater if this was on a large screen. The best video commentary is Milos Forman on Amadeus-- you can see his concern in making the story clear-- he worried that viewers would not understand the character walking thought the snow-- yes-- movies must be clear. Hitchcock knew to never hide stuff from the audience and that is all that passes for plot in this movie. People running to bad camera work and muddled storytelling do not make a great film-- it makes pretentious crap. As a technical worker I am also appalled by all the improbabilities-- his hands bleeding in one scene and Palmolive-smooth from then on. The way the phones and gizmos work was also pretty fanciful. I would like to think that the women that put all the secret documents into the FAX machine had them upside down-- all that got sent was the blank backs of the documents. And we all know about Hitchcock's McGuffin, but would the bad guys really keep every single incriminating thing in a handy set of files? After hanging around the mob and biker gangs I assure you that nobody, I mean nobody, acts the way these people do. Monologuing- they made fun of it in the Incredibles, I mean how can you have yet another boring chase if Jason Bourne does not call the antagonist and tell him he is in his office? Why not just run around downrange at the drunken redneck shooting academy? That is suspenseful too. And every time someone really has the jump on Jason, they go all squishy-- the girl in Tangier's, the women lead, and most unbelievably, the hit-man at the end. Yeah, the mob hit-men I knew always stopped and questioned their role in the universe when their mark made a sagacious comment. Oh, and Jason always tries to save the bad people's life, in real life he would kill everyone he comes across including the janitors, the children, and 20 or 30 other innocent people. The real pathos is that our country really does have a special rendition program that this movie could have exposed but it was so caught up in fantasy, derivative, make-believe behaviors and situations it could not comment on the grim reality all of us face as a formerly free peoples.",1,5,10,4 July 2008
Wanted," Disturbing
","Yes, this is a disturbing film. Disturbing that something so absurd made $135/$342 million domestic/WW box office on a $75 million budget. It really bothers me when something I hate is wildly successful. So like all old dorks, I will write it off to 'young people today'. Young people today like movies written for sexually frustrated 14-year-old boys. This movie is essentially a FPS (first-person shooter) video game made into a movie. So the real deal is they have to make some implausible story to allow the male lead to go on a killing spree.The movie shows some sad indications of the American male teen psyche.1) They hate their McJob. Well, why didn't he have the sales report done, the slacker? Maybe if he would make his deadlines he would be treated better better by the boss.2) They think cars make up for bad personalty. You can almost hear the millions of them, thinking in unison 'If I had a read Ferrari I could bang Angelina Jolie'.3) They want to kill people. The whole premise of the movie reminds me of the sniper in 'The Jerk'. You know, the one that utters the forever classic line 'Die, you random bastard.' So this is a movie tailored to murderous psychopaths, and it made 342 million dollars. That does not count the rentals or TV syndication. You can see why I am disturbed. It is hardly worth looking at all the plot holes and implausibility. Why should he care about his non-existent dad? In fact, whey should we care about any of these clowns? The bogus dream scene at the very beginning means the whole thing is called into question. There is absolutely no way to discern reality from his stupid teenage dreams. This may be some attempt at grand existential philosophy on the part of the filmmakers, but it is a violation of basic storytelling. This complements the violations of the basic laws of physics. Bending bullets, give me a break. When his dad was laying in a pool of blood you think he would have taken a swab so he could check the story at his local paternity clinic.'Father never wanted you in the Fraternity.' He wanted you in a dead-end job with a fat slob boss. How about sending him to Yale, or better yet a Wharton MBA? Double mind twists-- jeeze oh Pete, could someone please keep the good guys good and the bad guys bad? I am tired of switching sides. Seeing Angelina Jolie blow her own brains out was nice. She has bass lips and that always bothered me. She deserved to die. Die random bastress. I am writing this real-time, but I am sure Angelina will spring back to life, Who are all the tiny-peter teen boys going to vank off to, if she is dead? Ahhh, credits role, thank god. What a lame movie and worse yet, it is a shocking depiction how lame the young boys of the planet are. OK, space aliens, we are a bunch of effete mamby-pamby jack-wagons who get sad when we see yellow*. Time to exterminate this race and try a different DNA sequence.I loved the IMDb review that said 'This movie made Crank look like the Godfather.' In case there are some gullible and easily-influenced teen boys that only rave about this movie since they thing they are supposed to; sorry boys, I have worked as a mob soldier and hung around outlaw motorcycle clubs. Bad-ass tough guys don't go for this type of crap. They watch 'Ever After - A Cinderella Story' (1998). I'll be reviewing that next.*Gratuitous R Lee Ermey reference.",2,3,6,14 November 2010
Ender's Game," Dreadful
","OK men, we are facing a ruthless adversary with superior technology, intelligence, and numbers. Accordingly, we are going to have you play paintball all day. Don't worry, you get to play video games after that. Its like you never left your mom's basement.In what absurd universe do they let children lead armies, on purpose? Great life lessons, like kick people when they are down.Am I the only guy that thinks the black chick is a better actor than Harrison Ford? I like young fiction. I like sci-fi. I hated this.The only re-shoot save I can see is to have all the other kids be black. Every single one of them. Something about fast twitch muscles. And he is so lame all the other kids take pity on him. So each kid shows him their one special trick or cheat. By learning all of the tricks he becomes better than the other kids and saves the day. Plus you get those Oscar yappers off your back.Hey, it beats having some white guy play a Maori.PS: I shipped this before the movie ended. So I should warn no matter how bad you think it is as you watch, it gets worse. Much worse.PPS: To review the DVD, I would say 'Even the trailers are bad.'",3,1,3,13 May 2017
The Hurt Locker," Pointless and implausible
","The Hurt Locker is to war what Interstellar is to space, totally divorced from reality. I can forgive technical inaccuracy. I just watched Company of Heroes and thought it was half-decent even though it was full of mistakes. And its cinematography was far better, bless their Red One and a tripod.The shaky-cam might look OK on a field monitor while you shoot, or on a 27-inch TV, but I was getting dizzy looking at it on my 70-incher. I would be nauseous watching it in a theater. Newbie mistake, like setting up 4 cameras because the director lacks the self-confidence to plan the scene like Hitchcock did. I pity the editor-- 200 hours of film to wade through to try and stitch together a movie.The movie is pointless, with no coherent plot. That some reviewers think it is pro-war when Bigelow intended it to be anti-war evinces her incompetence. Maybe its abstract film, where the viewer supplies the meaning because the director can't be bothered to. Like Interstellar, this move is drama porn. Regular porn is sex scenes tied together with a weak or laughable plot. Drama porn is dramatic scenes tied together with a weak or laughable plot. As many soldiers have commented, nothing the characters do makes any sense. Why the hell would a bomb disposal crew be out riding alone in the high desert? Its so they can have the wildly implausible sniper scene. Why are they called out to suicide bomber that is still alive? To add to the drama. In reality, that clown would have been shot the second he was perceived to be a threat. I thought that Hollywood had passed its cocaine phase. This flick was like 'chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Yeah and let's have them pinned down by a sniper!' 'chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Yeah dude, rad, and lets have them help a suicide bomber!' 'chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Whoa dude, so awesome, and lets have them chase some bad guys into an alley!' 'chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Yeah dude, oh man, and lets have him go into a local's house with no backup!' Totally, I am sure the room was electric.This film is implausible. That suicide scene. What idiot enemy would go to that trouble and waste that much explosives when they know its likely to only kill one guy? What sniper hides in a shed with no escape route? And do effete Hollywood writers really believe a little fresh blood will jam a Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle?",3,1,3,28 February 2016
Ex Machina," Forgettable
","I had this scribbled down on a pad where I jot down movies I want to see. I had forgot to cross it off when I saw it 6 months ago. I had forgot I had watched it, the movie is that forgettable. What really astonishes me is that I hated the movie and I still didn't remember it. Its like the observation in Rounders that we hardly remember the good poker hands but remember the bad beats exactly. Yet I still forgot this turkey, after a few months. Its not even good enough to hate.I did remember seeing it soon after it started-- 'Ohhh, this piece of crap.' I still forgot the plot, and I fell asleep shorty after nerd-boy arrives at the compound. Fortunately I can read the 'spoiler' reviews here and remind myself of what happened.What a waste of talent and sets and cinematography. A simple re-write would have made the move much more interesting. The genius guy robot inventor should have been a robot too. That is the real Turing test. The quiet slave girl should have been the real human being. She had to make the inventor a guy since programming is a sexist profession and its the only way she could get taken seriously. Female 19th century authors had to pretend to be guys for the same reason.The inventor guy should be addicted to Ritalin, not alcohol, and remember, he is the real AI robot. The movie could be a series of mini-Shyamalans, twist after twist. He thinks the slave girl is a robot, but finds she is human. He things the inventor guy is a human but he is a robot. He realizes the slave girl is the genius programmer. That is the Turing test, that he can't tell the guy is a robot and he wants to have sex with the robot girl more than the real girl, who intimidates him. Get Lucy Liu.Then have the inventor guy robot rape the nerd. Ahh this is good stuff. And the nerd kinda liked it, but keeps wondering if he is queer since it was a machine that raped him and not a person. Note he confesses his thoughts to Ava, not the real woman. And so then he rapes Ava, and we can ponder if it is rape because rape was in his heart, even if it was a machine he raped.A million endings come to mind, but I would have the slave girl who is really a genius programmer get bored with the whole thing, and leave the nerd trapped to starve to death, with the guy robot raping him repeatedly, and the nerd raping Ava repeatedly, until he is so weak from starvation the inventor guy robot just tosses the nerd's limp near-death body around as he finally rapes him to death. It adds a comedy dimension that the movie so needs.Best of all, the slave girl real woman can fly out of the mess, and like the sociopath she is, start conjuring a new Turing test with new robots in a different compound. Now you got a sequel. Now you got a franchise.",4,3,8,17 January 2017
Elysium," Nailed to a cross of Aspergium
","Boy, the Asperger crowd are sure excoriating Blomkamp for this one. This is a film with an even grander premise than Total Recall. I guess the Aspies can't even relate to a hero that sacrifices himself to save humanity. They are too busy pointing out that he didn't refuel before flying to Elysium. Good gosh, I am an Asperger retard too, but at least I have some tiny shards of empathy, compassion, and a dim understanding of allegory. My favorites are the Aspergiacs that have numbered lists of all the things they think are just totally unreasonable in the movie. Don't be mad at them. You wouldn't go to the Special Olympics and start slapping around the kids because they can't do a 4-minute mile. You also shouldn't wish bodily harm on reviewers so literal, so linear, so left-brained, so detail-oriented, and so lacking in any analog understanding. Just be glad your brain does not lack the synaptic pruning such that when presented with an image of people running for their life, your first thought is 'Hey, shouldn't they gas up the car?' Perhaps it will give comfort to know it is a simple retardation, and when we get older, maybe move out of our parent's basement, and maybe have some life experience, we will be able to understand why this is such a great movie. Heck, maybe in 30 or 40 years, all these Asperger sufferers will come back and edit their entry to admit that maybe there is a thing called great art, and maybe we Aspies have a hard time understanding it, but maybe, just maybe, this movie does not suck.I will try to explain. It won't do much good, since along with the literalness, OCD, and social impairment, comes a monstrous dose of stubbornness, but lets give it a try. OK kids, see, when you make a movie, well, it has to be visual. Now the real future work hell is all you guys sitting in open-plan offices, with free cafeterias and 14-hour days. But see, filming a bunch of dudes sitting all day and typing is just not very visual. And sure, it will kill you, with diabetes, and stroke, and morbid obesity, but that is kinda boring to watch too. So this living hell you are in --right this minute-- see, Blomkamp showed it like a factory with stuff moving and loud noises and dangerous radiation. And it will kill you in five days. It is not important that every little detail be coherent to how you think the future should be. Its an allegorical representation of the life you live-- right this minute. If you don't recognize the two bosses, then you should apply to work at any billion-plus-dollar corporation and you can meet dozens of guys _exactly_ like them.And no, Blomkamp is not going to 'show us more of Elysium' because watching privileged rich pricks living privileged lives in a perfect place is almost as boring as what you do for a living. And before you complain that it was stupid to have to shoot the illegal aliens down from Earth, did you ever consider that maybe weapons of any kind are banned on Elysium? I can excuse Asperger brain function, but blithering idiocy is a bit harder to forgive. Watch the darn movie and try to admit that its world does not have to work exactly like the way you want it to. Were you screaming about the woman wearing a 45ACP Colt pistol in Star Wars? I am fairly certain that many people sensed the populist political slant in the movie early on, and decided to hate it from that moment. So they start pointing out 'the angle of the thruster could not possibly get the ship to escape velocity hence the entire movie is crap.' Well, maybe they can cling to the belief that if we all act like selfish pricks everything will work out just peachy, but I gave up that bogus 'philosophy' long ago.The script is brilliant, the CGI is brilliant, the performances are brilliant. I found myself thinking 'So that's what Jodie Foster is really like,' since I need to hate her to console myself that I don't wake up in bed with her every morning. I bet she is a really nice when she is not acting. Dang. The only thing I hated, and I really hated it a lot, was the Spaz-cam. Just like the Bourne movies, where an IMDb commenter said 'get a tripod and some lights'. What is it with Matt Damon and cameramen having epileptic seizures? Leave that crap for MTV and Mad Max movies. I dinged it a star for this alone.",9,2,3,20 January 2015
Woman in Gold," A superb movie, must see.
","The script was just enough-- pure distilled perfection.Its a nice simple story that you can follow. This is remarkable since there are flashbacks throughout.The writer, director or cinematographer is a genius or all of them. The old faded picture segue to a moving picture. The flashback characters materialize in the modern cafe. The students in the background of the art museum. Going to the men's room to lose composure. Driving through the yellow traffic light. Judicious gingerly use of profanity. The splitting the goodbye scene with her parents for maximum impact at the end. Conflating present and past in end scene in her house was a genius use of the actors and setups. Her being an amateur before the local court-- him with the Supreme Court.It was riveting, they wove a thriller into a drama. It showed the banality of evil, taking brothers off the plane. Mirren, what more needs to be said? It was like Amistad, that we have to honor our ancestors.What an uplifting story, and one you should not miss.",9,1,3,19 June 2017
Inside Man," OK script, so so direction
","The script was very clever, almost too clever by half. We all liked the 6th Sense, were there was a twist at the end. But we all hated every other movie M. Night Shyamalan has made, since there was not a twist meant to be enjoyed, they were tricks meant to make the director feel smarter than us. Spike Lee does not get quite so bad as M Nighty Night, but he travels perilously close to the edge of showing contempt for his audience. The saving grace here is that he did not write the script. The script was one of those deals where a creative guy sits around and tries to figure out how to do the perfect crime. we know it is a perfect crime since the robber speaks directly to us, twice, and tell us so. I do wonder how the robbery completely failing made it a success, but I am too literal to recognize this great art anyway. Anyway, so far so good.Then the scriptwriter adds the Jodie Foster subplot. Then Spike has to start jumping the time line around, like some hack director that wants to be like Memento. I suppose that the creative team felt so clever and daring, to keep the entire audience asking what was going on, since that was part of the plot, that the robbers made a confusing situation to rob the bank. But see, when you are on the inside with a intimate knowledge of the script, it may seem artistic and clever, but we peasant peon subhumans that actually have to pay 9 bucks to see this have to do it in real-time. We don't get to study and script and have creative meetings with butt boys lighting our cigarettes and laughing at our jokes for a 9 months. Same thing when they show the bank assault. We are somehow supposed to know that is not a real event, just what would happen if the characters did it. Jeez, sorry Spike, I didn't make the meeting, I didn't get the memo. So when Spike smash cuts to a hostage interrogation a day after the robbery, he knows he has jumped a day, but everyone in the audience, and I mean every single human being, is scrunching up their forehead and asking 'what the fu<& is going on?' And that little bit of profanity brings me to the other problem with the movie, that urban sensibility, where everyone uses the coarsest language imaginable, and all the wives act like porn stars. That on top of that is the normal cute little bantering and wisecracks in life-and-death situations. Boy you can tell when an upper middle class kid is trying to act like he knows the hood. At least Eminem is white trash trying to act like black trash. Spike has a lot harder time pulling it off. I have to tell you though, that when the wise-a$$ New York know-it-all takes of his mask and starts talking smack like all the other New York wise-a$$ know-it-alls, it was so great to see him being dragged by his ankles through the building screaming and begging for his life. We should do this to the whole city, one person at a time.I see why Hitchcock was so brilliant. He did not hold his audience in contempt and he did not keep things from us so he could feel superior and in control. So if you can put up with all the ghetto talk and the trickery and getting jacked around by someone teasing you, well, this is a pretty cool movie. Watching it the second time is much better. You know when Spike is jumping around in time and you know that the scriptwriter is going to trick you a couple times. Its hour and 51 minutes into the film before you see the robbers little construction project and you start to realize that the robbery is still in progress, although you are never really sure of anything since Spike has jumped the time line so much.I think the movie was saved by the actors, Denzel, and Jodie, and that fruitcake cop that slapped the Chinese kid in Boondock Saints, perhaps the most embarrassing performance by an actor in the history of this galactic quadrant. At least in this flick Spike kept him away from the Pacino pills that make you foam at the mouth and chew bites out of the scenery.I also love how Spike tries to make a statement about excessive violence in the kid's video games, in the same movie where he puts a gun to the bagged head of a hostage and blows her brains out. Oh, I see, when computer programmers do it, it is exploitation and objectification of your culture. When you do it, well, that is art. Yeah, hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue.Oh, credits role and they show a clapboard and outtakes over the credits. Great, see Being There for how a director can rob his actors of an Oscar by showing outtakes at the end of the movie.After the second viewing, I am sitting here still wondering what the heck the bank robber was doing. Did the Wiesenthal Center pay him to go steal the jewel and expose the bank president? Why did he not take the diamond? Did he get other diamonds, like the one he gave Denzel as he walked by? Who the heck paid for this robbery fiasco? Oh yeah, does anyone know why they dug up the sewer line? Did they send jewels down it or what? --",5,0,1,31 October 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Written by a college student....
","...and it shows. Only a child would have a worldview where violence is trivialized, spousal abuse is glorified, and nothing, I mean not one single thing, makes any sense. Have you read the most excellent 'World's Most Dangerous Places'? Where Robert Young Pelton talks about how a Pakistani bus crash is like taking a coffee can full of mice and metal shards and shaking violently and dumping it on the ground? Well this movie is the film-making equivalent of a Pakistani bus crash. It is like they took various action movie memes and put them in a coffee can. Car chases, explosions, shootings, sex, and jumping off buildings. Then they added the metal shards. Then they shook the can really really hard* and spilled the contents out on two hours of celluloid. Only a college kid could think that shooting guns was about loud noises and pretty flashes and not some lethal experience. The soundtrack was a cross between the Pink Panther and a Daffy Duck cartoon, only clumsier. Putting the R&B great 'Express Yourself' behind a domestic battery scene was so clumsy as to be criminal. What glib vacuous crap-- marital chit chat and banter during shootouts? Like I said, the infants that wrote, directed, and produced this movie have never ever been in any violent situation, not even a street mugging. I've been in rooms where guns are drawn in wrath and believe me, it is nothing like this tripe. The only thing that rings true in the movie is the marriage counseling, surely because all the self-absorbed people that made the movie had plenty of real-world experience in that. The movie has snail pacing at the start-- 16 minutes in and I was cleaning my nails. Then the implausibility starts. Then the flat-out absurdity. Fifty rewrites and it shows. Want a good rewrite? Vince Vaughn goes to the gyyyrll power agency where Jolie works, and one at a time asks each over-breasted airhead where Jolie is. Just as they start to answer Vince shoots them in the head. One after another. Then he goes to Brad's work and shoots that secretary and all his co-workers in the head. Then then he looks into the camera, says 'One day you'll thank me for this' and shoots himself in the head. Then 113 minutes of stills with Brad and Angela naked. Roll credits and take the awards at Cannes. Oh Christ mother of Mary, I just got to the part when she throws a knife in his leg. So he just pulls it out the engages in more of that patented BS Hollywood banter. Have these clowns never left the dormitory? Have they ever even suffered a paper cut?**Now we get to the biggest concern raised by this movie. It grossed $478,207,520. When space aliens come to visit our planet they will observe this and mark the human species for extermination. OK, there are a few good things about the movie. The director took the advice of the women who commented about his Bourne movies, 'Get a tripod and some lights.' There was some steady-cam and they had to shake the frame a bit since imitation gate weave*** is more interesting than the story. At least it did not jump around in time. When the smash-cut between Bradster and Angie-Angie-pretty-Angie they at least were staying in real time. But grossing half a billion dollars? I am ashamed to share DNA with a species that finds this film entertaining. Its like people would pay 9 bucks to have those Japanese seizure-inducing anime scenes flashed in their eyes for two hours. Folks, a hit of acid is a lot cheaper and you will leave the experience far more fulfilled then when you walk out of the theatre after this stinker.*Gratuitous Tropic Thunder reference. **Gratuitous Swimming With Sharks reference. ***gate weave is the tiny movements of the frame due to the imprecise repetition of the metal gate in old movie cameras and projectors.",1,5,10,22 October 2010
Lord of War," Didactic = bad
","I hope Wal-Mart takes this back. It sucks on so many levels it is hard to detail them all. Even the commentary was unwatchable. It reminded me of bad software documentation. Load accumulator with AX. Move AX to ACC. No kidding? I can see what you shot--- how about something a little more interesting? (See Walk the Line commentary for greatness.) Now I didn't decide to take it back just because it sucks. I decided to take it back because of the lame-a$$ anti-gun screed complete with fake 'gun manufacturers' included in the special features. I agree with Peter Tosh. 'Ain't gonna be no peace till man get equal rights and justice.' If people are not killing themselves with guns then they will use rocks. Or famine, the most popular tool of oppression. But give 30 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto guns and they can hold off an entire Nazi division for a month. That's why Hitler agreed with the creators of this movie-- first you take everybody's guns away.But I digress. Anytime you have huge sections of voice-over narration it is a pretty good sign the scriptwriter can't tell a story. The story spins from one improbable scenario to another. If you know anything about guns, history or politics you will dwell on the errors and not pay attention to the (bad) story-telling. The African dictator was the only sympathetic character-- which says a lot about the other characters.This rivals the badness of Dungeons and Dragons, the movie one perceptive commenter said: 'This is what happens when the director's mother owns a production company.' Yes, that bad. It is so pathetic hearing the creator's talk about their limited budget. Fifty million dollars is limiting? Look what Tarantino did with 1.2 in Reservoir Dogs. I guess when your purpose is proselytizing and not entertainment there is not enough money in the world to allow narcissists the tools to make everybody believe just what they believe.Do not buy. Do not rent. Do not torrent. Do not watch.If Wal-Mart won't take it back I am going to reverse shop-lift it onto their shelf just so the next poor guy can be disappointed without making any more money for the creators of this abomination.",1,22,50,7 March 2006
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Tropic Thunder for New Yorkers
","This is the definitive New York version of Tropic Thunder. Since New Yorkers have such monstrous cynicism, there is no deep meaning, like Tropic Thunder's 'Your identity is established by your friends.' This film is as smug as a Prius convention in San Francisco. I love it.I am trying to craft the rejoinder, the reflection, of Woody Allen's 'In LA people just watch movies and eat dinner.' I tried 'In New York people just watch dinner and eat movies.' That's just a stupid symmetric turn-about. Naaa, but this movie, and Margot at the Wedding, and that movie about the kid and his NYC psychiatrist dad or whatever that emotion fest was, they hold the key for what New York is all about.I think there is gnawing involved. When you pack rats together too tightly, or lets say when you pack small mammals together too tightly, they start gnawing on each other, until eventually they gnaw on their own little mammal feet until they bleed to death. Maybe that's it, 'In New York, people just gnaw dinner and then gnaw a movie.' Or actually, they gnaw a show.There is a lot of gnawing here, and you are expected to join in. Two solid hours of gnawing, with unity of place tossed in for good measure.You can see the LA/NY dichotomy quite clearly when you look at the batch of friends that came together to make Tropic Thunder vs this film. It would be fun to be on the Tropic Thunder set, whereas the Birdman set must have been a stressful hell, what with those long takes. New York requires suffering, from the snow and violence and dirt and from its art as well. Birdman channels Ricardo's labor theory of value via the self-flagellation of the Catholic Church channeled by Brave New World. They suffered, hence this must be good. Yeah, maybe so.You might look forward to the Tropic Thunder sequel, but I doubt there will be anybody awaiting Birdman Too (the insufferably long sequel).9 out of 10, but I would have given it a 10 if Kevin Kandenski walked out onto the set, the real film set of the theater set, set in a theater, looked around, and said 'How narcissistic are you people?' Then it would be a little like Synecdoche, New York.",9,0,3,25 February 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Overwrought mess
","Vamping off Dostoevsky's comment on families, all good movies are the same, each failed movie is unique. This is why I love to watch failure unfold on the big screen.Failure is fractal, it scales from the smallest detail to the largest concept. This movie does not need Mandelbrot mathematics to be bad, it has Ben Afflick. Ben is the fibromyalgia of bad, sending out little tendrils through the spine of a movie and making it suck everywhere. Jesse Eisenberg, more like a bad rash, helps with the disaster creation. I am surprised they didn't cast Adam Sandler.Reverend Ike in Detroit used to shout, 'Throw your money to the wall, that what sticks is for the Lord, that what falls is for the Church.' Well this was throwing plot lines at a wall to see what would stick. When none of them did, they just included them all into an over-long mess.What I love about the movie is that it depicts big corporate management failure at its best. First they hire a bunch of expensive actors. We all know expensive is not necessarily good. Gotta have plot, so they ordered a bunch up, and man oh man, did they get it. A bunch. And a bunch of sets, and a bunch of shooting locations, and a bunch of wire work, and a bunch of special effects.Oh crap, Charlie Rose is in this-- I hope the theaters had barf bags tucked into every seat-back.This movie is pretty much suited to its target-- Asperger fan boys. Talk about lack of synaptic pruning, this thing is all over the place. Lets see how far along I am--- 46 minutes in, 1:45 to go, gosh help me, the horror, the horror.They didn't hire a director that understood kid fanboys, they hired a kid fanboy. And they were surprised when they got an infantile movie mess.I was always surprised when I took probability and statistics, how a certain outcome could be foretold with such a small sample size. But the confidence interval tells no lies. I am sure the minute they came out of the focus groups the studio knew it had a flop. I like to pretend I am the Webster Wolfe fixer they call to patch up the mess. There is no fix for this, Ben Afflick is in it. Maybe they could hire Christian Bale and digitally map his face over Ben Afflick's, but there are probably a whole slew of contract issues. Note to big studios, be sure to put in a clause that you can replace the actor's face and voice in all contracts.Now somebody is grabbing somebody's heart out, foretelling more senseless plot points. Oh crap, an hour and thirty five minutes to go, give me strength.Dragging a car by a cable, I guess the laws of physics never mattered, so whey should they now. And Batman needn't stand on a crane shooting tracking arrows into the truck, he could just sit in the Bat Cave and reroute the damn truck with a hack and some Perl code.I hated this move from the opening shot of Bat Boy levitating, when the whole beautiful premise of Batman is he had no super-human powers. Then it was a dream, and I hated it even more, lazy hack third-rate story telling hacks.Big plus, Eisenberg just used the word 'Junebug' which reminded me of 'I'm Gonna Get You Sucka,' which was on Bounce last night. I have the DVD, of course. 1:21 to go, please make it stop.The Superman actor looks a tiny bit like John Travolta, around the mouth. 1:16 to go-- I know a movie sucks when I don't pause the DVD when I go make a sandwich, unlike Vera or even that Woody Allen Paris flick I watched last night.OK, I am going to take a shower and get ready for bed, while this movie plays out. Pro-tip to the studios-- watch 5 contiguous episodes of NYPD Blue before green-lighting anything. All you need a 6 good guys, 2 bad guys, and Sipowicz slapping one of the bad guys in the back of the head. Anything more is excess. Oh dear deity- Wonder Woman, who's next, Wolverine? I hope he slashes them all to tiny chunks and puts them on a pizza.Nooooo Kevin Costner-- nooooooooo. If you film it they won't come dude, and they sure won't pay. Time to shower. A new Simpsons on tonight.Well I'm back, totally refreshed, as if the shower washed this bad movie off me. Thankfully I watched Total Recall 2012 two days ago, so I was prepared for bad. I can't believe I am saying this-- but I would rather watch a Bob's Burger episode then the end of this mess. See ya!",4,1,3,6 November 2016
Atonement," As rotten as its subject
","I guess probabilities exist that would see me taking out Aliens and Cowboys, Child 44, and this piece of crap from the library on the same day. All three suck, and often in the same way.This movie is a Mean Girls with level-1 Tarantino, a schedule II Shyamalan, with an Altman tracking shot kicker. The Tarantino is because it jumps around in time, a very 1990s device and pretty bankrupt in this day and age. Worse yet, it plays the exact same scene over, just from a slightly different POV, so it wastes your time while it confused the story-line. Its a Shyamalan since it has a sociopath twist at the end. This allows the writers to hurt you the same way the creeptastic girl in the story hurts everyone around her.The Altman kicker is the long tracking shot at Dunkirk, in a scene that was irrelevant to the story. Its as if these young directors have to brag at cocktail parties, 'Oh I shot a horse chase in the desert (Aliens and Cowboys), or in this case, 'Oh I shot a beach scene from WWII.' Because the technology of movie-making has advanced so much, the scene does look better, but these self-absorbed directors put it down solely to their genius.The horror of this movie is that it made money and got acclaim, which will only encourage more of this self-indulgent crap. I guess if your brain is still infantile, and you like pretty colors and distracting sounds, yeah, this film is great for that. If you have moved past a noisy mobile dancing over your crib, to the point where things have to make at least a little sense, this movie is atrocious.Acting is good, other than direction that has them all seem autistic, as they all pause for 12 seconds rather than respond to whatever manufactured senseless dramatic situation they are faced with. Direction is so inept he changes the actress playing the 'star' and also starts referring to her by her last name instead of her first. What point in this crap, symbolism she is changing? Go back to film school, and stay there.Robin Williams said 'Cocaine is God's way of telling you that you make too much money.' A deleted scene titled 'Walking through the fields' is God's way of telling you that you have too much budget.The movie is titled Atonement, but that is not what it is about. First off, there is no atonement. The creep girl does not recant until she is 79 years old. Robbie's mother, her parents, everyone she hurt is dead. Cumberbatch is dead, unable to reply to her new accusations. Some atonement. The movie seems to be a love story, until the Shyamalan happens and its all a lie, told by the lying sociopath narcissist girl who ruins everyone's life, including the people that watch this drek.So just when you think are are watching a move about a young couple, its really about this despicable creepy crap brat. Great, I love to see scheming creep sociopaths, especially ones that maneuver their lies into a big life payoff.You could toss out all the war scenes and the scenes with Anorexic Girl. Then it would be about Briony. You would have to expand her POV and linearize the story line. Thing is, who would want to watch this creepy little liar? A novelist might think the story is all about the little budding writer, but everyone else sees her as an ancillary little distraction to life. A dork.There were implausibilities. Like why didn't the police re-trace Robbie's path to prove he couldn't have tried to rape the girl? And prison for attempted rape, pretty much a mild assault? No, hardly. Even if her daddy was Lord Truplewaite of Devon on Hardwicke.The movie was like a promo reel for the director, showing off his scenes, the hiding from the Boche, the trudging in the field, the hospital scene. I guess that is why I hate this movie so much. The soldiers coming into the hospital moved me to tears, and rather than stick to a coherent logical story, he had to bounce off to his next self-indulgent show-off clip reel.I agree with another commentator. That there is a privileged class in the world that never had to work at anything and always is guaranteed to have a happy ending. So a happy ending is boring to them, whereas to us its the rarest of occurrences. I am sorry that the Marie Antoinettes of the world like this movie, it shows we are in need of a colony collapse disorder.",2,2,4,18 April 2017
