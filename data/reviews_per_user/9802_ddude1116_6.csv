The Avengers," While DC descends into plausibility, Marvel stands to prove comics are just fun
","This is a basic comic book film handled with style and finesse in the hands of Joss Whedon. I've always been a fan of his, and I'm glad to see he finally got his chance to shine on. The premise of the film is Loki, brother of Thor, steals the Tesseract, from last summer's 'Captain America' and uses it to unleash his own army upon the world, and claim it as his Kingdom. However, this is the weakest point in the film. In reaction to these events, Nick Fury calls upon his most wonderful of agents, and assembles them, somewhat, to deal with this. Here is where Joss Whedon shines. He is a man who knows characters, and has a skill for witty and well-placed dialog, but also of great vision. He understands the ego of all those involved, and plays them off of one another, including a fantastic scene of Iron Man and Thor going toe to toe for the sole sake of their arrogance. Captain America stands as the voice of reason, but his naivety is blatant; his was a simpler time. Black Widow stands in the background as a seminal character, but obviously one unused to the limelight. Hulk, played perfectly by Mark Ruffalo, is the humble doctor, always subdued for the sake of safety. These are people who are used to having the spotlight their own, and so they must learn to play well with others, but it isn't until the death of Phil Coulson do they realize the necessity to their alliance, which Joss Whedon displays masterfully in a continuous shot of the group fighting Loki's army in Manhattan. This is not a compelling film, but it respects its characters and uses their own energy to drive the plot in a fun and controlled manner. It's a spectacle to see, and the dawn of the Superhero Epic.TL;DR It's 'Seven Samurai' with superheroes. Go watch it.",10,2,6,6 May 2012
Se7en," On the road to greatness, they pulled over at the last moment.
","As soon as the film ended, and David Bowie began to play on the credits, I could only wonder why David Mills shot Kevin Spacey when he seemed so much like he was not going to. And then I realized it was a faulty seam at the end of a blanket, which would allow it to unravel and fall apart. Don't misunderstand this; I'm not complaining. The end seam may be insufficient, but it is still one of the warmest blankets you could have the pleasure of, and it only unravels once you aggravate it. No. I'm only reflecting, and wondering. I wonder how the ending could have changed to suit the grandeur that is the entire film prior to that fatal shot? What if Kevin Spacey lived, or they gave no indication whether or not Mills shot him or did not shoot him. I cannot honestly say, only that the ending is the reason why this film is one of the best of the year, and not all time. Perhaps, that only way to accurately describe such a thing is in its own words: 'There isn't going to be a happy ending. He's only human, and that will be disappointing.' Either way, Se7en is a phenomenal achievement in film, marred only by its own brilliance. It seems as if it burnt out at the two hour mark, and then faded away, fading from the annals of memory and grandeur.",9,1,3,14 January 2012
Spirited Away," A film which achieves magic
","'Spirited Away' is not a mere title, but an act in itself, for watching it, you become spirited away yourself. This film is truly magical, and although it's clich√©, and although it's been said, undeservedly, of many films before, I feel there is no other way to describe Miyazaki's magnum opus. To watch 'Spirited Away' is to give reason and to breath life to watching movies; it transcends all of which a film is capable.It guides you through the story of Chihiro, a ten year girl moving to a new home, while her parents are sidetracked and she is swept into a bathhouse for the spirits. This bathhouse is the main location for much of the film, and a living entity all in itself. Never have I had the pleasure of meeting, however briefly, the staggering number of characters than in this film, from a six- armed boiler man to an unspoken radish spirit. Chihiro's story is given credence by its humanity and empathy, and achieves magic. It's a film you have to see to understand how wonderful it truly is, for describing does little at all. Watch it, rewatch it, and pay attention to the corners of the screen, it's well worth the effort.",10,0,1,1 August 2012
City of God," If 'GoodFellas' were set in Rio de Janeiro
","Films either rely more on style and less on substance, or more on substance and less on style. Here is a film which finds the perfect balance. Set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, it takes the dreary atmosphere of desperation and poverty and breathes new life into it, giving it a pulse of color and rapid camera movement. This film follows the life of Rocket, a kid born to be into crime merely to survive, and how he becomes what he wanted to be. He is the narrator, and it opens with him being caught in what appears to be a scuffle between a local gang, and the cops. But he quickly interjects, telling us as the audience how we won't understand unless we know the entire story, and so it begins with one of the most minor and clever tricks of the camera. These little bits exist so completely in this film, you hardly notice them, they work so effectively. They work to bring you into the slum, and between the narrator and the director, you'll feel as though you've lived in a slum all of your life, and are merely used to the goings-on. This film is truly a spectacle to behold, and one of the best films I've ever seen.",10,0,2,24 April 2012
Elysium," Solid entertainment, but amateur storytelling
","Elysium has such an intriguing concept, I went into the film very eager and excited for Blomkamp's follow-up to District 9, thinking he'd overcome his flaws. But after viewing Elysium, I've come to the conclusion he needs a writing partner.This film takes place in 2154 after a prologue establishing the wealthy have fled the now overpopulated and polluted Earth in favor of a space-retreat called Elysium. Earth citizens try their best to ensure passage to Elysium on the black market, but they never succeed thanks to Jodie Foster's Secretary of Defense, Delacourt. These people, it establishes quickly, want access to the medical technology held on Elysium (early in the film a mother cures her daughter of her severe fractures in one of these pods). Think now on how neat a concept it is: the Earth has become a slum and their put all of their effort to MAYBE be healed on Elysium. Getting up and being in perfect health for the few minutes is enough for them. All political implications aside, Blomkamp has thought up a hell of a dystopia. Earth is no less interesting, however he never follows up on either of these.What I enjoyed about District 9 was how immersed we became with the prawn slum, and how unconventionally we became so. Elysium lacks this. It's very much a straight shot, cause-and- effect plot. It's very much amateur writing. Elysium lacks any trace of dramatic irony, though I noticed multiple instances where it would be necessary, and also any sort of character development (jodie Foster seemed to exist only as a catalyst for the plot).The story follows Max (Matt Damon, who does a very good job adding certain depth to an otherwise listless character), as he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. This starts the ball rolling on him getting to Elysium to be healed. He agrees to pull off a dangerous mission in order to secure unauthorized space passage, but he finds himself in more of a jam when he becomes the only cerebral carrier of a program to overthrow Elysium's government. SOmewhere along the way he meets childhood friend, Frey, but she doesn't add much. She just confuses the plot, since their history is never told, nor is she at all developed.Where the film shines is in its visual direction, both cinematography and action. Elysium had a much better reason for its action occurring than District 9, but it also planned out its action better. Since Max was suffering from severe radiation poisoning, he was given an exoskeleton to keep him fit as a fiddle (you'll need to suspend your disbelief for much of this) and he ended up taking on the wonderful villain, Kruger. This leads to many fight scenes. However, Blomkamp would splice random shots of slow-motion to add structure to the action so you never really feel lost, though you may still get sort of dizzy. He also had some neat camera tricks where he would twist the angle mid-scene so the action did not get as boring. I also enjoyed how Max and Kruger's fights were more battle-of-wits than just duking it out. Max learned from his prior mistakes in fighting against Kruger.This is, above all else, a very entertaining film. Blomkamp (from whom I expect much more in the future) kept the plot concise and the cinematography and special effects are absolutely beautiful. It's easy to follow and its political implications are smart and relevant. Don't expect any surprises, but it does pretty well at making what you expect fun to watch. It's just a good summer flick.",6,50,100,8 August 2013
The Fighter," The Awkward Child of 'Raging Bull' and 'Rocky'
","For a film about a champion boxer, Mickey Ward, the boxer in question, is the weakest character in the entire film. It is the supporting cast who hold this film up on two legs, and it's ninety minutes of them bickering and thirty minutes of anything else happening. This film is horrifically unambitious, taking the actual story, and molding it over the forms set forth by 'Raging Bull' and 'Rocky' before it. Sports movies have a fairly general array of stories, but 'Rocky' did it best for a boxing film. 'Raging Bull' is less boxing film and more biopic, focusing on a general set of points regarding one's life, and it set the standard. 'The Fighter' is half-and-half. Its story is that of a boxing film, but its focus is on its characters, except Mickey Ward, whom I thought was the main focus of the film. So you sit through two hours of Christian Bale smoking crack and Amy Adams and Melissa Leo fighting, and that's it. Then there's a brief training montage and WHOO!! Mickey Ward won the Welterweight Title. Awesome. Too bad the filmmakers neglected every step it took to actual make him an empathetic character. Come on, David O Russell, his childhood was probably relevant. Show him growing up, being put down, how he developed into the sad sack he became, because it is so much more relevant to Mickey Ward, for he lacks the emotional issues of Jake La Motta and the approachable earnestness of Rocky Balboa. I don't care if his BROTHER was a crack addict or his MOTHER was a nightmarish fiend of a woman, what I care about, or want to care about, is HIM.",3,1,3,30 March 2012
