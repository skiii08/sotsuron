Skyfall," A failed mission!
","While it had the hype and numerous rave reviews, I must say my wife and I were very disappointed in this Bond effort. Having been a teen when Dr. No hit the movie screens, I became a Bond fan for life...well, for most of them. This show started off like the previous two -- wall to wall action in an extended fight/chase scene. From that point it became more like a 24 Hours TV series, except it lacked the pace or action. Overall, the villain was too perfect in his planning and Bond was helpless to stop him. With a purposed hit during a hearing with the PM and no one is ready for the bad guys??? The villain has people waiting for him or working for him at ever avenue ... for what? Money? Fear? Political means? No explanation as to why so many follow this insane villain blindly. But in the end, there's the very fact that Bond fails miserably in his mission. By then we were just hoping the overly drug out movie would end. I wonder what movie those giving 7-10 stars saw. This Bond rates as one of the poorest, longest and most unsatisfactory of this great series.",4,14,30,13 November 2012
Star Trek," Better than expected...except for Bourne nonsense film work.
","Yes, we (my wife and I) watched Star Trek when it was first released to television. The hokey costumes, the plastic phasers, the cardboard looking sets...it still beat most Sci-Fi of its time. We enjoyed the movies...Khan, the whales and the final conflict; but didn't care for the New Generation series, nor the second or third installments for television. We went to this with mediocre expectations and were, for the most part, pleasantly surprised. Not for the overall plot, but for the development of the characters we had known for so many years. Other than a relationship which had never been brought forward and a girlish replacement for Chekov, the characters were believable and entertaining. Our singular complaint was the filming. As with practically every movie made since the 2nd Bourne movie, the directors insist on sticking the camera up so close to the action that it's impossible to watch -- not only can't you see what is going on, it will give you a headache from eye strain if you try. For goodness sake, wake up, Directors! If Cecil B DeMille had filmed the Ten Commandments that way he would have ended up a bum begging on the streets. As for those nay-sayers decrying this movie was a bust, perhaps they went with different expectations. What we saw was a new beginning with familiar characters. I'm not sure what else you might have expected.",8,1,6,11 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Better than the last.
","While certainly not up to the first Pirates, this one had some substance and a degree of watchability over the 2nd Pirate. Still, the overall movie was dark and brooding. The subject can be blamed for much of this, but the humor was only an occasional quip or minor sight gag. It lacked the redeeming humor from the first show, but was not so slap-stick outrageous as the second. The length is not as much a problem as the last, but the fight scenes do tend to drag and Depp's sanity bogs down and is tedious almost from the onset. In all, it is worth a look, though many will find the convoluted plot mismanaged and hard to follow.",7,5,8,6 June 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Sadly less charm than original.
","I paused to read many comments before I chose to go see Hellboy II for my birthday. I was skeptical from previews which showed endless fight scenes and a multitude of creatures. It seemed there were no humans in the previews and I feared there would be no connection for a human who was not a fanatic of the comic series. Sadly, my gut instinct was correct. An endless array of creatures -- each more awesome in destructive power than the last, and fight scenes which are as frequent as an old Kung Fu flick. I did enjoy Hellboy himself, but there was not enough time given to his love for Miss Firestarter...or any measure of maturity gained from their relationship. He needed his father to guide him, but (other than an early flashback)there was no father figure for him. As for the newest member, a tin-plated throw-back to Robby the Robot, with a terrible German accent, he was about as entertaining as Jar Jar Binks! In retrospect, it is a very visual show, but the characters as sadly lacking for depth and human empathy.",5,14,35,11 July 2008
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fooled by previews
","Suckered me in on this one. Preview made it look like Iron Man had taken Spidy under his wing -- mentor and trainee sort of action. Turns out this is material written about a teen searching for puberty and had only a cameo or two of Avengers. Then there's Hollywood dishing out PC-ism to the 10th level. Peter is the token white character, with no white friends at all. That isn't any more disconcerting than being preached to or brainwashed -- often subtle, but at other times flagrantly -- by the writers of this tripe. If this is where the Avengers are going, I'm no longer looking forward to their two-part ending ... just to it ending.",1,18,32,11 July 2017
Knocked Up," A poor excuse for romance
","Why are there no decent romances being made today? While You Were Sleeping and The Wedding Planner can't be the only heart warming ideas in the world of romance. Here we have foul language and a host of unlikable characters, drug abuse and even a title that many people find vulgar. Being linked to teen trash such as American Pie by some who have reviewed this film and presented in the same format as Wedding Crashers and The 40 Year-Old Virgin, I should have assumed the worst. However, with Katherine Heigl leading the cast, I was taken in. Always a fan of the young lady, I was sadly disappointed. My advice for those wondering if they should see this movie -- If you're over 40, it probably isn't going to be what you're looking for. 13-30 and immature, go for it. The writer is on your level. Between those ages, you're on your own.",2,6,15,6 June 2007
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Shoot the camera man!
","My wife and I really enjoyed the first Captain America and looked forward to this after reading some reviews. After watching the movie I have to ask: 'What movie did you people see?' The camera work must have been done by a three-year-old. People were moving at warp speed during fight scenes, but you could only see an extreme close-up of about one square foot at a time. Shouldn't you see the whole picture instead of checking the actors for nose and ear hair? And what happened to the human factor? It's like they put together a ten minute script and then called 'Action!'. The fight scenes were too many and too exaggerated -- plus there are only about a dozen good people in the entire show. It's like Washington DC...everybody's a bad guy wanting to rule the world. I still enjoyed most of Steve and Natasha's exchanges and there was at least two emotional moments in the movie that were good...but they didn't save the story for us.",3,50,116,24 April 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ruined by the camera....again
","Okay, so the plot of the last Bourne was good -- who could see what was going on, unless you wanted to count the pock marks on the actor's faces. Paul filmed this one even worse. Why waste money on action sequences that no one can see? I despise film critics for encouraging this form of film degradation. They call it inspiring and cutting edge.. but it is crappy and amateurish, readily more disturbing than having a two-year-old sitting behind you and kicking the seat for the entire two hours. I've yet to meet anyone who liked the way either of these movies were filmed. I own the first Bourne and would loved to have had them all...but not if they are not even watchable. You'd do as well to catch the audio and listen to this on tape.",1,41,83,5 August 2007
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Uh, where are the middle-of-the-road viewers
","So... the PC crowd and all of the paid or employees of the production give this a 10 of 10, with an occasional 9. Then every so often you get a 1 of 10. It makes a person wonder.
Shouldn't this be like Amazon -- you have to be a verified viewer to submit a review. I mean, who are you kidding with a couple hundred 10's? Does anyone really believe those people who use the same view words to describe every show they review: Best Ever!, Perfect! Fantastic! My favorite of the series!
Then they proceed to use the same patented comments as if they wrote one review and used it for a dozen films.
The last clue is when a show had the rave reviews from the critics. When is the last time critics actually got a review (for an average Joe/Jane movie goer) right?
So we did sit through it, suffering a string of insults for being white and the usual teenage writer jokes. It wasn't the worst movie, but it certainly was not the 'Best Ever'.",4,51,136,17 December 2018
Salt," A lame copy of 24 Hours
","Even if I hadn't learned Angela Jolie was replacing a male lead, it would have been painfully obvious...from the very first scene.When you think action and tough for a woman, Angela is at the top of the list. But that isn't a good thing when it comes to contrived and ridiculous pulp like this. We're supposed to believe you can brainwash a child of six or seven years of age and it will stick with them for the rest of their lives? Evidently, this author missed puberty and the fact everything changes. Fall in love, everything changes. Live in a free country as opposed to an oppressive one...well, do the math.I will give the movie credit. Angela's love was about as female as she was male. He was housebroke and a it seemed he did most of the cooking. Plus he was soft and mushy, while she was...OK, I'll say it -- the female Jack Bauer.If unrelenting action, chases and fights are your thing -- especially if you want to see Angela whip several guys at a time or beat even a professional twice her size -- spend your money. As for me and my wife, we suffered through this with a free Red Box rental...and felt we paid too much!",2,0,2,21 December 2010
Captain America: Civil War," A Disappointment
","Like so many continuing series, they always have the split between the characters -- like superman fighting himself, of the pathetic Batman vs Superman. Writers can't seem to continue a winning combination. The first Avengers movie was a 10! The characters did have inner fighting, but they were always going the same direction. Civil war gave us endless battles and shaky-camera action until I was forced to use the fast-forward just to sit through it. Chemistry of characters, fun and humorous interaction, with a common goal -- that's what these super heroes should be giving us. Instead, there's no trust -- And I mean, when has Captain America not been trustworthy? And when has Iron man become to dense to listen to reason? I'm glad I didn't fork over the money to see this at the movie. I'm wishing now I hadn't bought the DVD, but had rented it instead.",2,3,6,13 October 2016
Quantum of Solace," Worst Directed Bond EVER!!!
","Why would anyone spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on action scenes and then flush 90% of it down the toilet? This is the question I asked when the 2nd Bourne movie came out. The fight scenes featured either the star and the bad guy or a wrestler and the gay off of Will and Grace rolling around. We bought the first Bourne movie because we got to see the action. Nope, didn't buy the second and never even went to the third. This will be the first Bond movie we won't buy either. We had our daughter try to film a family softball game with a 8MM camera and it looked like the opening chase scene in this Bond movie. Damn! she should have gone to director's school. Look at the money they are paying some slob to film an action movie as poorly as she did our game--and no, they hadn't invented the new cameras that reduce jiggling back then. I give it 4 stars for the scenes we could watch...and that's being generous.",4,8,13,18 November 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," dull to tedious
","Two more sequels to this? Good luck keeping the audience awake. Why? Well, let's start with stretching a single story into 3 movies 7-9 hours long. If you embark on such a mission to milk a cash cow, you should first hire some writers to flesh out likely characters, add some humor, perhaps include a romance, so the story isn't razor thin. After watching our hobbit on Sherlock the BBC telling of Sherlock Holmes, I felt he was an excellent choice. Too bad they didn't bring along Sherlock to give him some character. And the dwarf men are mostly disgusting barbarians with only two or three even being tolerable. Where is the fun in this movie? Where are the characters you want to root for? Even the visit to the elf village was dull and without any real story. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie. I was able to fast-forward the repetitious fight scenes -- again, a bunch of old, overweight dwarfs defeat hoards of warriors ( warriors that could notwhip Barbi!). It would have been a relief to have killed off a couple of the worst dwarf characters, even the wizard himself, or the hobbit...who would have noticed? They weren't the least little bit real to me and my wife anyway.",2,8,15,22 March 2013
Stardust," Missing something....
","The previews of this movie had us waiting with baited breath. But, alas, it failed to bring forth a single endearing character until the final few minutes. Visually entertaining, with a great idea -- ghosts, witches, flying pirate ships...all enticed us to buy tickets. From the poor opening week gross, it is evident some other people were wiser than we. When Robert Di Nero is not convincing one points at the writer, director or both. The hero is weak and does not inspire an empathy from the viewer...also he is pretty stupid not to be amazed that an actual star is a beautiful girl. Michelle Pfeiffer's character steals the show, otherwise it would have been a complete waste of time.",5,10,20,17 August 2007
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne becomes Fugitive
","This was not the usual Bourne plot and that turned out to be a bad thing. Jason Bourne always had someone to seek out, to get justice, to get answers.This is an endless chase movie with no resolution. Rachel does a good job with her part, but no one goes after the bad guys here. There's no direction other than to run.Then (Spoiler Alert)because the company is shutting down the program and killing all of the agents and those involved in the process of making super beings we discover...another higher grade super being.What is this ... Terminator 5? The new X-men? Overall, the hero doesn't even want to know who's behind this, doesn't seem to care, just wants to run and hide.Playing like the second Star Wars -- a vehicle from the original movie to the next episode -- this was not worthy of the Bourne name.",3,6,15,16 August 2012
Logan," X-man or X-rated
","So the professor, literate, classy, cultured ... uses the F word like Hollywood stars or rap singers. Wolverine... OK, but he used to have a sense of humor and actually be partially human. 
We enjoyed Wolverine in his first movie... and he was tolerable in the second. But this?
I can only wonder if all of the high ratings were submitted by people contemplating suicide. Dark, brooding, ugly, vulgar... 
Glad we didn't pay to see it.
Glad we didn't pay to rent it.
Glad we had something else to watch so we didn't ruin our afternoon of popcorn and a movie.",1,3,12,27 August 2018
Taken," Should have been better
","The teaser warns how dangerous Liam is and the set-up is enticing... slave trade, kidnapped daughter and so on. Liam had a team of high-tech people to help him...but goes it alone. It's like Mission Impossible, except it's not Tom going solo this time. This should have been a great action film, with gadgets and planning, with a team working together to not only get back Liam's daughter, but bring down the entire kidnapping/slave trade organization. Instead, it's just one string of killings and fight scenes, followed by chases -- plus the baddies are the worst possible shots in the world. At one point machine guns blast away from near point-blank range, shooting holes through the doors and windows of Liam's car...but every shot misses both Liam and the girl in the back seat. And when it's not ridiculous that so many bullets could miss, the shooters simply can't hit a standing target twenty feet away. This would have been a great film if Liam hadn't gone it alone. And he left most of the enslaved girls in the hands of the baddies. What kind of hero is that?",5,20,33,9 February 2009
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Better than expected
","First, this is the Twilight saga, so the criticism I've seen seems to generate mostly from guys who wouldn't like chic flicks anyway.As a husband, I dutifully took my wife to this last installment, not exactly thrilled at the idea, but figuring it would have to be better than the part 1, which left out many of the key ingredients that my wife enjoyed in the book.I found this a much faster paced movie and the ending seemed to have been engineered mostly for the male audience. The characters were a little more animated and easier to watch.On the negative side, if I hadn't had my wife to fill me in on a few details I wouldn't have understood some of the motives ... such as most of the battle at the end was over Alice, and not the newborn half-ling.In all, I thought, from a guy's perspective, this was equal to Eclipse.",7,4,13,21 November 2012
The Green Mile," A reason to hate the Academy Awards
","The political correctness of the academy awards has ruined the whole reason for having them. When a dull, less than inspiring work by Michael Caine takes the Best Supporting Actor from the best ever work of an actor like Michael Duncan Clarke, one can only shake their head in disgust. Clarke gave his all in this show and it was his one real chance to win an award. But the PC crowd who voted nixed any chance because this show actually had a spiritual side to it. With Caine, the PC'ers could promote abortion, and that was their logic. As for the show, I gave it 9 stars, because I felt too many people would never be able to see it with the R rated language. The characters were all great, the show moving and never boring considering its length. Shame on the movie industry for stealing the Oscar from Clarke, a man who has since passed and will never have another chance to win recognition.",9,0,1,22 March 2016
Wonder Woman," PC'ism was disrespectful
","Captain America was better for two reasons -- his patriotism and the lack of any naked men being on display. While we enjoyed most of the WW movie, it is irksome to see Hollywood screwing with the feature to make their liberal points. Point one: Does every movie have to feature a naked man? Is this on the Gay agenda, or -- due to the director being female -- is she a pervert? Yes, we see that all of the teenage boys and beer-drinking crowd laugh at the scene, it seems most embarrassing to the actor and those of us who still have a shred of decency. Point two: The Native American Indian blames the white man for the loss of his country. The Onondaga Nation, a part of the Iroquois Confederacy, unilaterally declared war on Germany, citing ill-treatment of tribal members who were stranded in Berlin at the beginning of hostilities. The Oneida Nation, another member of the Iroquois Confederacy, also declared war on Germany. Over ten thousand Native Americans went to war to help America save the world. When WWII came along, the Native Americans joined by the ten's of thousands to help save the rest of the world a second time. What a great line it would have been if the Native American said something like: America is my country too!",7,1,6,6 June 2017
The Wolverine," Waste of money!
","Two is probably one star too many, but that's for the effort Hugh Jackman put into a weak, disjointed, ludicrous plot. The camera work on the fight scenes were obviously an effort by the director to promote the efforts of a normal 3-year-old...although either of my girls were better at that age than whomever they let do the filming. Be nice if film makers would stop having their idiot camera men run down the street, jump over objects and crawl over broken glass when they were filming action scenes. They totally suck. As for the plot, everyone is trying to kill the girl Wolverine decides to protect. However, any one could have killed her at any time during the drug out, unbelievable fights...which Wolverine seems unable to win. Good thing they didn't use X-Men in the title. They would certainly be facing a lawsuit by every other respectable X-Man.",2,4,8,30 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Is it just me?
","After the first two installments of Batman we were looking forward to a fun and entertaining conclusion. Instead, it seemed this movie dragged along at a snail's pace, other than for a couple too-long fight scenes.What happened to the characters? Three hours and only Robin showed any real character or depth. Cat Woman came in about 4th in the Cat Women of the past. Not only Michelle in The Penquin, but also Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar far surpassed the latest model.As for a villain, there was nothing remotely special about this incredible hulk, other than his muffled speech. We found him totally unbelievable and had far too many followers who were suicidal. I mean, who in their right -- or wrong -- mind would follow this guy to their certain death? I guess we must have seen a different movie than those who are raving about this. Sorry, but we call 'um as we see 'um.",3,4,10,25 July 2012
Beowulf," When is a cartoon not a cartoon?
","I remember the first time I saw the Wizard of Oz and thought the people making films must be magicians! The first King Kong...best of its kind every made! The Ten Commandments...perhaps the best ever of any kind ever made(because of its time period). I was also enamored by the Disney classics, Snow White, Cinderella, Jungle Book and some of the latter...Ice Age and Shrek. But every one of these Video Game graphic movies are the same ... lame characters, wooden figures and dull background settings. How great a film would this have been with live action? And glasses are a pain, even if you already wear glasses so you are used to them. I hated the fact Disney made Sinbad as a cartoon and they cancelled the live action one with Keanu Reeves. Make real movies for real people, not just game freaks. I gave this a 2 and it really wasn't worth that much except the monsters were cool. Of course so were the monsters in Lord of the Rings...uh, but then that was with live actors!",2,7,15,24 November 2007
