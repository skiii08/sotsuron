The King's Speech," Beautiful
","The camera angles are incredible, artistic. Uses a lot of rule of thirds. The locations are gorgeous. Absolute spectacular acting by Colin Firth. I find speech impediments so intriguing and beautiful in their own way The the artist cinematography and amazing acting kept me so intrigued. It is also very interesting to learn about a historical figure.",10,0,0,16 June 2017
Zodiac," Catch Him Already So the Movie is Spectacular
","Interesting movie. Based on real events in California. Keeps you thinking, which engages you into the story. Acting from Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo are great. Only downside to the movie is that it doesn't give many answers, because the story in real life doesn't give many answers.",7,0,0,16 June 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," A Classic
",This movie is highly regarded as a classic and has won many awards. I have to agree that it is a classic and it deserved all those awards.. This movie kept me intrigued. An amazing thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Anthony Hopkins did an amazing job as Dr. Lecter.,9,2,4,16 June 2017
Am√©lie," What a Character!
","Wow, everything about this movie was excellent. The writing, music, cinematography, comedy; all of it was awesome. There were a lot of weird moments, but I think this highlights Amelie's character. I loved Audrey Tautou's acting. I found her small facial reactions to things extremely attractive. This movie is not about one particular thing.There is romance, comedy, drama, and mystery. In the end they all mesh together through Amelie's character. She is one of the most unique and marvelous characters I have seen in cinema. A wonderful job by all involved in this film.",9,0,1,16 June 2017
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Eh...
","I enjoyed this movie. I read all the books a long time ago. I hate Katniss. In the books, I only liked Gale. The second book I felt was just trying to keep the hype from the first book. There was no need for a second Hunger Games. She could have went a different way with that. Anyway I thought Lawrence did well like before. Nothing too fancy, but the costumes and locations were good. Above average movie that kept me entertained.",7,2,3,16 June 2017
