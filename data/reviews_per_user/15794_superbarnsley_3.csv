Requiem for a Dream," Happy Days...
","The one emotion I felt after watching this was one of warmth.  My piddling problems (dumped by girlfriend, soccer injury, no food in the house) seemed like bliss compared to the tribulations of Requiem's characters.  How Ellen Burstyn didn't get the Oscar I'll never know. Connelly, Leto, Wayans were all superb.  I agree with the comment about making you love the characters and then destroying them all.  Leto's attempt to make some cash and abstain when stocks are low, Connelly's dream about the designing, Burstyn's crazed desire to be on TV, and then it all turns to dust.  The two girls with the dildo was one of the hardest things I've ever had to watch.  The humiliation, the horror, the horror.  Stunning directing, amazing editing (it must have taken a while) and top-class acting. A must,must see.  Note interestingly symbolic foetal position of all the charcters at the end.  Poignant to say the least. ***** out of *****",10,0,1,4 November 2002
Pi," Different....
","Firstly, let me comment on how disappointed I was to read David Heatherly's patronising, hipper-than-thou debunking of November 3rd.  While I may be a 24 year-old, who, excuse me, hasn't studied esoteric mathematics, I felt it to be a novel and dynamic experiment with a subject that many of us do not know too much about.  Sure there was a lot of style and editing, but I wouldn't have wanted to sit through a two-hour lecture on the ins and outs of number theory.  Enough.  I was impressed with Gullette's debut, he certainly cut a mathematician-style figure.  Quirky, nerdy, private, general social recluse, with no time for any of the comforts we normally afford ourselves.  This man eats, breathes and sleeps mathematics.  Aronofsky is obviously a big fan of the on-body camera, brought to light by Scorsese and Harvey Keitel in Mean Streets, and uses it with good effect. I recently saw Requiem for a Dream and noticed it appearing again. Lighting superb, editing outstanding.  I eagerly await Aronofsky's next installment.  Watch it and decide for yourself. **** out of *****",Null,0,1,5 November 2002
Raging Bull," The finest two hours on film
","There is little to criticize in this film.  The splendid camera work, the perfect 1940s New York locations, an unsurpassed cast, splendid editing and of course the inimitable combination of De Niro and Scorsese make for a movie that feels timeless - with most films there is usually a quality that allows one to determine the approximate age.  This is due in no small part to the black-and-white film, although few ignorant of its age would guess this film is now 21 years old. The fight scenes are magnificent - super-real in detail (the fights are reportedly taken punch-for-punch from the original ones) while LaMotta later commented that after a gruelling training regime De Niro could have quite conceivably turned professional.  Scorsese used differing sizes of boxing rings to illustrate atmosphere and boxing style.  If you ever see the film, take a second to notice. There are countless memorable moments and endless quotable dialogue, and the everyday scenes counteract the explosive fights.  Joe Pesci turns in a lifetime best performance (in my opinion better than Tommy in GoodFellas and Nicky in Casino), while Cathy Moriarty is excellent as LaMotta's long-suffering wife. There really is too much to write about.  Just watch it.",Null,1,2,19 September 2001
