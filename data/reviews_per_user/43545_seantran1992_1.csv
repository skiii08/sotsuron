Skyfall," Good Bond movie but not great.
","There is only ONE thing that killed this movie for me. First of all, we all know movies like this...'The good guy eventually triumphs over the bad guy.' But it is good storytelling that makes you forget that. So we all knew Javier Bardem's character Silva was going be defeated. But that is not the point. The point is how he died so easily. The whole movie built on how intelligent and sinister he was, and just like that he gets a knife in the back and dies. There is no final fight scene between Bond and Silva? Silva being this former MI6 agent, a favorite of M at one point, does not go toe to toe with Bond? That killed this movie for me. Overall, I do like this movie but it's not one those movies I would watch again. On the other hand, the other characters and the action/chase scenes were absolutely fantastic!! That is what saved this movie. 7.5/10",7,2,9,11 November 2012
