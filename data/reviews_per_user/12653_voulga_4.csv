The Devil's Advocate," Surprisingly interesting
","Let's find out how devil and being an attorney are linked. Story: attorney ending up to work for the devil!!! It's interesting to see how the plot started and twisted. The characters are very well written. The conflict between a hard job and family, being ambitious and dedicated to your goals and personal life. Talented Al Pacino weaving a trap to Reeves in order to take a certain decision in combination to the concept of free will. Of course, Theron's role as the attorney's wife was fascinating.Acting: Wonderful Al Pacino, very good Theron, adequate Reeves.Recommended!!!",8,0,1,3 May 2016
Creed," Didn't wait for anything better
","Well... I really don't get why this movie thrilled everybody. It seems to me that everyone starts digest whatever American product is served. Anyway, if all is needed in order to get a prize (though being an actor incapable of acting) is to pretend having white hair and cancer, then I see why Stalone took the awards!!! This movie disclosed something else: growing old and becoming a veteran can give you awards regardless the quality of the movies you have made.What's more, Stalone seems to confuse real world with the artificial - movie reality, he probably even thinks that Rocky really exists! When I saw the statue of him in the city, that was the impression I got. If you want something superficial and light, then that's your movie.",2,3,7,1 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Couldn't have been worse
","I had high expectations, but the movie totally disappointed me! 1.the whole scenario was so confusing, no specific story. Everything was a little bit mixed up: too many different stories, too many characters. I guess the plan was to produce something strong causing strong feelings. But that didn't work out for me. 2. Sorry Ben, but you have been the worst batman I have ever seen: no expressions at all, a constantly sleepy mood, your face didn't change at all during a 150 minute movie. 3. For once again we were forced to see batman's childhood. OK, but unless you have to contribute a different glimpse to the story, don't do it. It seemed to me like a desperate effort to touch one's feelings. 4. I think that a repetition of a story, with new actors in the roles of batman and Alfred was doomed to failure from the beginning. Take the same actors as before if you want to give to the story the sense of continuing. 5.superman was classic, I didn't expect something more. He was way better than Ben Affleck! 6. But that didn't save the situation, since the acting was at least inadequate, making me think that the artificial beast could probably take an Oscar for its performance!!! 7.last but not least: marvel, in order to combine superheroes especially if they fight one another, you need a good script so tight and firm so that the audience will understand what you show. Moreover, if every year 4 to 5 movies of this kind are produced, the quality can't be high. Sorry, for the harsh critic but the high expectations I had went down the drain.",1,35,73,24 April 2016
Deadpool," Boring till death!
","Why did I waste time in order to see this movie, that I don't get...1. Desperate Ryan's effort to be funny made me bored.2. Mix of humor/irony + a little bit of romance and sex + a little bit of blood and broken ribs are not always the recipe to Hollywood success. 3. Girl's attempt to be sweet and leave the underworld couldn't make you feel sympathy. I will not even refer to his friend and the rest superheroes who seemed to get bored with the movie the way I did.Overall another failure for marvel, who wanted to produce something easy to digest...",1,73,155,30 April 2016
