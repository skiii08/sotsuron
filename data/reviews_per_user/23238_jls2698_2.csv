Vertigo," Often Sublime
","Often sublime, although admittedly initially plodding, 'Vertigo' mostly manages to transcend the medium of its inherent restrictions. Most viewers of the film will concur with Robin Wood's statement, 'It is one of the five or six truly beautiful movies of the cinema' (Wood was one of the first popular advocates of placing 'Vertigo' in the category of a cinematic masterpiece. Without his proponent stance, the piece perhaps might have been largely ignored), especially in the final half. Instead of weaving a web of intrigue and building to a suspenseful finale, as Hitchcock so consistently executed ('Sabotage,' 'Strangers on a Train,' and 'Dial M for Murder' are all instances), 'Vertigo' assumes a more mature Hitckcockian approach that would dominate most of his films following. 'The Wrong Man' (1957), although still following a 'standard' expository/narrative pattern of build-up and suspenseful release, demonstrated the first signs of an underlying consciousness within the main characters (more significant than the entertainment value of simple suspense or danger) achieving a closer examination than the empirical reality and situations. 'Vertigo' continues this approach, although much more overtly: Hitchcock achieves the confidence in this film (which was released at the height of the Studio System in Hollywood) to explore several characters' inner psyches as the central diagesis. Of course, as most reviewers have noted, 'Vertigo' is a personal examination of the director's own fantasies and fears.Studying any Hitchcock film certainly requires not only an analysis of the specific piece as discrete, but also as part of a collection and ongoing statement by the creators. (No avocation of the auteur theory is implied.) It is interesting to compare the some aspects of the overall structure of 'Vertigo' with 'Psycho.' Audiences were purposefully manipulated into sympathizing with Norman Baits after the death of the supposed-main character in the 1960-horror film. But in 'Vertigo,' a strikingly similar phenomenon occurs: after the death of one of the two main characters, and the apparent 'resurrection,' audience sympathies shift. 'Vertigo' achieves this by, interestingly enough, forfeiting suspense. 'Psycho' utilizes an opposing but parallel methodology; it gains suspense by the shift in alliances.Bernard Herrmann once stated that without his musical score to accompany and complement Hitchcock's visuals, fifty percent of the film would be lost. The composer's words are especially true in 'Vertigo,' where the lush and textured melodies are absolutely necessary to the quality of the picture (in terms of audience involvement, identification, and emotional response).
Despite Hitchcock's other well-regarded masterpiece, 'Psycho,' having more obvious influences on trends and developments in film (it essentially established an entire genre), 'Vertigo''s impact in the history of cinema cannot be overlooked.",Null,2,3,20 July 2000
Good Will Hunting," Worthwhile Film (** Spoilers **)
","The statement, 'Better in execution than design,' appropriately encapsulates 'Good Will Hunting.' Despite an apparent brilliance and creativity in discrete scenes and sequences, examined generally and on a macro level, the film's plot and directional structure lack severely. However, the characterizations, dialogue, and overall mise-en-scene project a unique tendency similarly absent in both mathematics films (recall 'Stand and Deliver' as a blas√© manifestation of mathematical concepts to an audience) and 'Boy Wonder' pictures (movies with a genius-laden protagonist; most are, much like mathematics films, merely adequate and not passionate about the qualities of their main characters).The most effective parts of 'Good Will Hunting' show the conflict between two sets of parallel individuals: Will and Chuckie, and Professors Lambeau and Maguire. The intense and latent rivalry between the two academics describes a potential future for the two twenty-year-olds. Maguire consistently, at least on a superficial basis, searches for the default respect the MIT mathematician receives. Will, although reticent and clearly an outcast, seeks a similar form of respect, although not for his academic qualities, but for his social abilities. Throughout 'Good Will Hunting,' both pairs of spotlighted characters, after a series of enlightening 'adventures,' become comfortable with themselves. Despite this banal-sounding narrative flow, the execution is mostly interesting and often unpredictable. Similar to 'Jackie Brown,' 'Clerks,' and 'Pulp Fiction,' lines in 'Good Will Hunting' sound realistic, albeit on a near-poetic and superlative level. Anecdotal portions of the dialogue are given a relaxed temporal frame with which to develop. (A standout instance is Skylar's last-wish tale.) Although the strong propensity toward vulgarities and obscenities is evident, it almost is rendered justifiable; lines are well constructed to 'ease the fit' of the negative language that in many other films is overtly unnecessary and inappropriate. The lyrical music, which relies on short minor-key short melodies rather than grand designations (a John Williams or James Horner variant), is appropriate for the film and functions effectively as a 'personal score' for Will Hunting. Danny Elfman, who composed 'Bettlejuice,' 'Men in Black,' and 'Batman,' has rarely shown restraint in his music. The reticent notes support the characterizations rather than defining them (as his other works have often accomplished).Other than the mostly mediocre diagesis, the film's largest fault is the treatment of its logic in its supposed-main topic: mathematics. Ignoring the errors in the content (a Fourier series, the professor claimed, was to be the first problem on the hallway chalkboard. Instead, simple undergraduate Linear Algebra appears. Of course, this lapse is not noticed by most of the audience, and it does not alter the piece in any respect), more serious errors surface: If Will was another Ramajidan, as Lambeau claims, why was he not given any queries on anything more than an undergraduate level? How about assigning Hunting unsolved problems, like the Goldbach Conjecture or the Reimann Hypothesis? Certainly such mathematical questions should be enough to challenge a truly gifted mathematician.",Null,0,1,26 July 2000
