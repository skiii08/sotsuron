The New World," School Made Me Do It.
",The reason why I watched this movie was because my teacher put it on and I only watched like the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. The things I liked about this movie was that if you try something on the captain or the leader the whole squad goes and wrecks you. I liked how that dude John told the dude to say he died in the sea on his way to the UK. I also like how Pocahontas when she was dead she was in her own little world doing cart wheels. One thing I didn't like was that she was just a 10 year old already getting married because that was weird but oh well. The movie was a pretty good movie but I didn't really like it because I'm not into the history topic. The actors were good I guess but maybe they could of gotten someone else to play their role.,4,1,1,30 August 2018
Wonder Woman," War
","I would recommed you should watch this movie because it shows you some of the old war and it has lots of action if you are into action movies. I liked how Diana took down the tower when she jumped off the guys backs. I liked how Diana killed Aries because it was kinda like a laser beam move from dragon ball z. I didn't like how Steve died, I felt like he could of jumped out and shot the plane. I watched this movie so I can get a grade and it's probably the best movie I have watched in this class.",10,5,7,15 November 2018
Cinderella Man," James J. Braddock
",This would probably be the best movie I've seen in the classroom. I liked how James went back into boxing so he can provide food and money for his family. I also liked when he said 'I told my kids I would bring the title back but they thought I said I would bring turtles.' The thing I liked the most was when Braddock won and how he always had pride. I disliked how Max thought he had it in the bag and the way he was talking smack. That shows to never be cocky and underestimate your opponents. This movie showed that even in the hard times you can make it and do something good for you and your family if you try hard enough.,10,1,1,4 December 2018
