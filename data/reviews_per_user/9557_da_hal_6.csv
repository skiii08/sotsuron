The Ring," not bad, not good, but better than other recent films
","In 1999-2000, I spent a year in Korea teaching English. While there, I had a very surreal experience. Before the summer of 1999, all Japanese imports, including films, were banned in Korea. Beginning that summer, the moratorium on Japanese cultural imports was lifted. One of the first Japanese films released in Korea at this time was 'Ringu.' However, since it needed to be captioned into Korean, it was released six months after it's initial release in Japan, just in time to be in theaters with the Korean remake, 'Ring.' (Apparently this is why the American remake was called 'The Ring.') My surreal experience was going to see the Japanese version in a multiplex also showing the Korean 'Ring' at the same time, with all the Koreans panning the Korean version and flocking to the Japanese version.Back to the topic at hand, I liked the American version better than the Japanese version. The Japanese 'Ringu' was basically what I call a 'yap' movie, where the there's so much story that all the characters can do is basically make discoveries and discuss it with each other. The American version has much more action, and is much faster-moving than the original.However, a copy is still a copy. The final scene where the 'monster' is revealed is much more effective in the original, just because to me, it's the 2nd time I've seen it. Others who watch the remake first may disagree. (What interests me, however, is that I think the American version used the exact same clip and/or technique as the original version. Close viewing of the 'monster' scene shows that it was filmed in reverse and played forward, just like the original.)But, the American version didn't just copy the copy of the original, but threw in a whole bunch of other modern themes as well, such as the creepy little girl (The Others), the little quasi-psychic boy (The Sixth Sense), the quest for a father theme (The Rookie,) and female protagonist not dying (I know what you did last summer, Scream, Halloween, too many others to count.)Overall, the highest complement I can give this film is that I didn't feel ripped off, which is pretty high praise nowadays.",Null,0,0,29 October 2002
Fight Club," three movies in one
","'I am Jack's movie review.'One reason this movie is so hard to classify is that there are actually three separate storylines in one. The first is a comedy buddy movie between Pitt and Norton that takes about the first half of the movie. Intertwined into this is a psycho love story between Norton and Carter, taking about the same parts. Project Mayhem is where the horror/thriller begins, along the lines of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'Part of what makes this movie unique is the juxtaposition of three non-cliched cliche storylines. It's a sick, twisted buddy movie. It's a sick, twisted love story. It's a tame horror/thriller (where other than Meat Loaf's head-bullet and Norton's neck wound, nobody gets seriously hurt.)
'I love you....Sir.'What makes it work is the comedy. The funny parts make the ludicrous parts more realistic and bring a very unusual level of reality to the actors and the situations. 'Dark comedy' or 'black comedy' is most often used to describe this film, although few dark comedies reach the levels of hilarity this film does.To avoid spoilers, let's say that for most people, the first viewing is nowhere nearly as rewarding as the 2nd, 3rd, or 40th viewing. And then, once you think you've figured it all out, you discover even more hidden caveats in the DVD commentaries.One tidbit at the end of the actor's commentary is that Norton approached Pitt and they talked about making movies that stand the test of time. While some movies still in print are still in print for mysterious and unknown reasons, in literature, 'classic books' are those that contain universal themes, often while reflecting culture and society of the time.
'Fight Club' definitely has a lot of philosophy, a lot more than say 'The Matrix.' A short list: Fathers, fatherhood and a father's responsibility the existence, real or imagined, of God the Feminization of men Anger vs. aggression friendship, relationships, and love mental and spiritual strength vs physicalHowever, the philosophy here has not reached the mass appeal of say Yoda-isms from 'The Empire Strikes Back' nor 'The Matrix,' probably because of realistic context, homeoerotic overtones, or general weirdity. But, are they universal? Definitely. Does it reflect the culture of the day? Of course.'The 4th rule of movie reviews: make up your own words like 'weirdity.''So, should you watch 'Fight Club?' There's a 50/50 chance to either really love it or really hate it after the first viewing. If you already hate it, maybe it's time to watch it again. There's a level of maturity that is required to really enjoy it and get past the repulsive surface features, frat boy mentality, and toilet humor.'You haven't watched a movie this f*cked since grade school.'",Null,0,1,23 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Bad writing, worse effects.
","As I was watching this film, I kept Roger Ebert's immortal words in mind, that he 'couldn't recall a single line of memorable dialogue.'This is exactly what's wrong with this film. The writing is atrocious. In the original, where the lines were original, witty, and delivered with great effect, in this film, I dreaded every time a character opened their mouth.For example, C3PO to R2D2: 'Idiot!'Wow.In fact, R2D2 is the only one with a shred of their future/past dialogue.Also, Ebert helpfully pointed out that what lines there were were culled from every single cliche ever made. Again, he was right.For example, Annakin on his mother's death: Mom, I'll miss you...soOoOoOoO much.Regarding the 'look and feel' of this film, I would say it lost too much using digital effects. The actors have no environment to play off of. Many of the animated characters lack weight and physical presence, without even the slightest hint that they actually exist.But now it's time to say something nice about this film: It didn't suck as much as phantom menace. For that, I would say it's the 2nd worst film in the series, or 4th best, depending on how you look at it.",Null,0,0,22 May 2002
Watchmen," Ambitous, yet falls short.
","The biggest problem with the Watchman comic is that the nuances only emerge after repeated readings. There's really no way to capture this in a film, where the goal is to be entertained in one sitting.While faithful to the comic, as a film, it fails. However, if you enjoy '300' style fight scenes, this movie will not disappoint.For me, while I had nostalgic enjoyment at how it followed the comic, and I do enjoy 300-style fights, the film rang hollow and the actual story seemed tinny and archaic.Overall, while fans of the comic will not be disappointed, I think this story was better told in 1989 than 2009.",5,3,6,10 March 2009
The Color of Money," This is a movie that can change your life
","In retrospect, anybody who has seen both 'The Hustler' and 'The Color of Money' have a hard time judging the relative quality of the two films. Depending on which one you have seen first, you probably will pick that one as the better of the two.However, this film changed my life in that after watching it, I was determined to become good at pool. Years later, after attaining a certain degree of ability, I watched it again, and found the shots to be rather simplistic and contrived.Compared to 'The Hustler' however, where the main actors made all the shots themselves, there was an amazing degree of ability displayed. In the latter film, the shots were set up for them, while in the former film, the shots took more skill.This, however, is not what changed my life. While playing pool does have a significant role, I was most astounded by the degree of skill this movie was directed in. The first time I saw it, I was impressed by Tom Cruise's 'skill.' Later, I was astounded by the camera work.Without the imaginative direction, this movie would have been an average flick. With it, (for example, look at when the helicopter sound starts during the first con Newman and Cruise pull,) this film becomes genius.Hal",Null,3,6,12 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good and bad, but don't expect too much
","First of all, after reviewing the other comments before this, I was surprised at the shallowness of most of the reviews.From a cinematography perspective, the movie is incredible. Ang Lee continues his tradition of beautiful shots. While some people complain about the pacing, as you can see in many other movies, slow pacing is used to build atmosphere and tension. From a western perspective, yes, I also found the movie a bit slow in parts (the whole desert seduction just kept going and going and going,) but from a filmmaking perspective, it is a great achievement.From a cultural perspective, I found the dialogue incredibly bad, not so much for what was written or the character's motivations for saying what they did, but the delivery. Perhaps in China, you can deliver a dramatic line with no pacing or pauses, but in the west it sounds a lot duller.As a kung fu film fan, I was most disappointed with the quality of the fight scenes. Perhaps, Lee looked for the best actors, not necessarialy the best fighters.Also, I am not a big fan of wire-fights. If you watch any of Jackie Chan's movies, or Jet Li's classic 'Fist of Legend,' you get a true sense of superhumanity, and any wire fights afterwards pale in comparision. (One such incredible actor who will no doubt become a household name in a few years, James Dean Bradley, the white guy in Jackie Chan's woefully underrated and barely released in the US 'Gorgeous,' is one amazing example.All that being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend seeing this movie, because the story is so strong. Every character has 2 or three different and competing motivations for every single decision they must make, and the decisions they actually make make their character really come alive with complexity and emotion.If I would compare this movie to another, it would be John Woo's 'Last Hurrah for Chivalry.' Again, there is a strong story, lots of wire fighting, and good cinematography.In summary, if you are looking for good fighting, you can wait for the video to see this movie. If you are looking for a good time, then go see it on the big screen.",Null,1,2,30 January 2001
