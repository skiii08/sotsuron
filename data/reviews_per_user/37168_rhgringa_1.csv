E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A friendly extra-terrestrial who comes to visit us.
","This is an extremely good movie. Every time I see it, it makes me cry as well as smile. It's like a fusion of emotions. ET is one of those movies that make you go back to your childhood no matter how old you are. Although it is an old movie and doesn't have all those visual effects of modern movies, it does have its magic and still being interesting to the new generations. This is a family movie for all ages. Most of you will fell identified with one of the many characters of the movie, as all of them have different personalities. Definitely is the kind of movie that any parent would like for their children's to watch. Absolutely highly recommended.",10,0,1,8 April 2009
