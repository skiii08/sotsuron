Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones will always be Mr. Action-Adventure!
","For the past few years I wondered if this film was as thrilling as people made it out to be, and to be honest, the only reason why I watched it is because I love the ride at Universal Studios. Yes I know, go ahead and laugh. Fortunately, I finally took the time to watch Indiana Jones do what he does best and I came to my conclusion. Raiders of the Lost Ark is by far the standard for action-adventure movies. The action scenes are astounding and the music adds intensity to every moment. Great acting, beautiful settings, and a solid story-line also help make this a timeless, epic film. I truly wish I had seen this movie sooner. The fun in this film is guaranteed to bring out your inner child. My suggestion, get the popcorn and snacks ready, and watch this on the biggest screen you can find!",10,1,2,26 June 2015
