Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It lived up to the hype
","I really liked this movie. I have heard some very good points about how the story was lacking, but in the long run, I think it was just fine. I think it did a great job of setting up the rest of the first trilogy. If people look too much into it, they will forget a very important fact, it's ONLY Star Wars, and it is not meant to be some life-changing experience. It's only the critics who think that, at least that's my opinion. It is meant to be a simple story of good vs. evil that the whole family can enjoy. People say it appears to be made for a younger audience, and I agree, but it also has a lot to offer to the older crowd as well. The funny thing, though, was how similar the story line is to that of A New Hope (Episode IV). Exact same idea. a Queen is in danger, and a young Skywalker from Tatooine comes to the rescue. Obi-Wan has an influence on the Skywalker. R2-D2 and C3PO are there, and a younger apprentice must see their master die. In the end, there is a celebration, and the queen honors the victors. the end. It is so simple. But it works, and I think the fans will like it too.Oh yeah, if you look real close, you'll even see E.T. in the movie.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Perfect Timing
","This movie could not have come at a more perfect time...In our world today there are many problems...I hate to bring up bad memories, but the incident at Columbine High School upset many people. Many of these people have since been quick to place a lot of blame on the media and video games....Well, South Park has a weird political message to it...It says that it's not the Media's fault that parents don't pay attention to their kids, and then don't listen to them when they do a bad thing....In the movie, Kyle's mom starts a war with Canada, blaming them for her son cussing...when the whole time she should have just punished kyle, and talked to him about what he saw and heard in the Terrence and Phillip movie ( The movie the boys see in the movie). It also pokes fun at, and makes people take a serious look at, how we treat certain people. Jokes and comments are made about Jews, Homosexuals, and blacks to name a few. This is definately a movie worth seeing..Just be aware, you may be offended, it is a very Vulgar and offensive movie to some....but it get's a point across that really needed to come out right about now...Media has not caused societies problems, society has caused them...",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
