Lucky Number Slevin," The Kansas City Shuffle
","Let me get this out of the way first. Wow! I mean this movie blew my mind!The Wrong Man (if you live in Australia), or Lucky Number Slevin (if you live in the states) is a thriller starring Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu and Stanley Tucci. Directed by Paul McGuigan, The Wrong Man was released in 2006 and seemed to miss Australian cinemas all together and came here direct to DVD. Now normally, that indicates that the film will be a bit of a waste of time. But in actual fact, this is far from the truth. With an all star cast and well known director, The Wrong Man is one to definitely watch.The story revolves around 'The Kansas City Shuffle', explained by Bruce Willis' character, which is 'When everybody looks right, you go left.' The story is a well crafted thriller, that provides a breath of fresh air from most Hollywood films as the writer didn't presume that his audience is stupid. This film makes you think and just when you think you have the story figured out, the story takes a sharp twist and sucker punches you where you least expected it to. The story is a Kansas City Shuffle in itself.The Wrong Man is a real credit to the screenwriter's talent, Paul McGuigan's ability to direct films and the cast's ability to act unlike most others in Hollywood can.To say that this film is awesome doesn't even begin to explain it.When you're next at your local video rental store and can't find anything to watch, I strongly recommend that you go to the Thriller section and hire The Wrong Man/Lucky Number Slevin.Find the review and more at:http://ingloriousfiction.tumblr.com/",8,4,6,5 February 2011
Sucker Punch," An escapist's dream
","As a Zack Snyder fan I was excited to see that he had finally released an original piece of work, rather than another adaptation such as Watchmen etc. I watched this film in the cinemas twice. So instantly you'll be able to tell this is a rather positive review of the movie and I enjoyed it greatly.Babydoll played by Emily Browning is thrown into a mental asylum by her evil stepfather after her mother and sister's death. She is scheduled for a shady lobotomy by her stepfather in five days to hide the truth about her sister's death. To cope with her horrible reality, Babydoll envisions that the asylum is a brothel where the girls dance for the men. Babydoll plans to escape the mental asylum and enlists the help of her fellow inmates in acquiring items to aid their escape. Whilst the girls are stealing the various items, Babydoll dances to distract the men and while she is dancing she envisions different battles (from giant mecha samurais, to steam punk world war 1 zombie Germans, to a castle battle with monsters and dragons, to robot gunmen on a train) that depict the girls acquiring the specific items.This film is beautiful! As you would come to expect from Zack Snyder, the cinematography is gorgeous and stylized; it really captures Snyder's vision and scope of the film. The different battles are amazing, my favourite by far being the giant mecha samurais battling against the tiny Emily Browning.Many people have said that Sucker Punch is a sexist film. It is far from that and many of the lead actresses will say the same thing. OK so yes, the costumes are a tad raunchy, but that's what makes the film what it is! You couldn't just have the girls battling in alternate realities in boring old 60â€²s clothes.The music is by far a stand out in the film. The way Snyder has used music with the vision gives it a very video game/music video feel and this works exceptionally well. A stand out track would definitely have to be Emily Browning's haunting version of Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) which was used at the start of the movie behind the slow motion action of Babydoll's past. Actually, all of Emily Browning's songs are great! She has an beautiful voice which I never knew she had before this film.One thing I hate more than anything, is people comparing films to other films. And Sucker Punch has copped these comparisons left right and centre. NO this is NOT Inception, NO this is NOT the Matrix and NO this is NOT Kill Bill or anything else you can think of. It is an original piece of work with an original story line. And even though it showed obvious influences from anime and other films, it is completely original! Sucker Punch has an awesome story and message of hope, friendship and self discovery. The movie is not over complicated, but a lot of people might not understand exactly what's going on; for instance the guys I saw it with didn't fully understand the transformation of the asylum into a brothel. The message it tries to convey isn't overly complicated and if you go into the film thinking you'll gain some greater understanding of life, or go in thinking it'll be something it isn't, you'll be sorely disappointed.In essence, Sucker Punch is an escapism film, designed to transport the audience into the stylized world of Zack Snyder's characters.The movie had several twists and turns that will hit you like a 'Sucker Punch' (sorry for the overly bad pun). You won't expect some things and I won't ruin the ending, but you don't see it coming at all.To conclude, I loved Sucker Punch! This is by far Zack Snyder's best film yet and had strong performances from all actors, but especially Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish and Oscar Isaac.Do yourself a favour and go and see Sucker Punch while it's still in the cinemas!Rating: 9/10Joshwahr/Inglorious Fiction",9,3,8,14 April 2011
The Day After Tomorrow," The end is nigh
","The Day After Tomorrow, released in 2004 and starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal is a natural disaster apocalypse film from the director of Independence Day; Roland Emmerich.This CGI packed action adventure gives the audience everything they could hope for and much more. The lead roles played by Quaid and Gyllenhaal are superbly acted, especially when Quaid's character must choose to trek through the fast approaching ice age to save his son (Gyllenhaal) at any cost.The story is immaculately written and portrayed on screen, delivering a message that will stick with you long after watching this film.When given the choice between more recent apocalyptic film 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, I would pick the latter every single time. They are both excellent films, but The Day After Tomorrow brings a sense of realism and believability with both it's scenario and story line. I came away from watching The Day After Tomorrow actually scared that something of a similar nature could very well happen.This isn't just another 'Inconvenient Truth' styled documentary film, but a fictional story based on events that could possibly happen. The Day After Tomorrow is a film definitely worth watching!",7,3,5,5 February 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A Film Obsessive's Review of 'Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol'
","Let's start this off by saying that I'm reviewing 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' with my fan-boy goggles firmly on. I went and saw it at the advanced screening on Wednesday the 14th of December 2011 at Hoyts cinemas, Frankston in their EXTREME Screen. I am a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, except for MI2... Let's just pretend that John Woo never tainted the series with his over-stylized, horribly geographically incorrect and bordering on racist film.But MI2 is not the reason why we're here! After the series reclaimed it's original panache with J.J. Abrams' MI3, we're now treated with 'Mission: Impossible (4) - Ghost Protocol.' I put the number four in brackets because whilst this is the fourth film in the series, they've decided to go against the numbering in the film titles and give it a flashy new name with 'Ghost Protocol.'The latest adventure see's Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in his biggest and nigh-on impossible mission to date. The film kicks off with Agent Hanaway (Josh Holloway from 'Lost') murdered by an attractive assassin named Sabine Moreau (Lea Sydoux) for a document containing Russian nuclear missile codes, which she intends to sell to a terrorist known only as 'Cobalt' (Michael Nyqvist from 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' series). Hunt and his team are sent into the Kremlin to retrieve files identifying Cobalt and this ensues in a very cool, but tense scene in which Hunt and Benjy Dunn (Simon Pegg) hide behind a cloaking sheet as they infiltrate the Kremlin archives. But alas Cobalt was there already and he sets off a bomb in the Kremlin, framing Hunt and his team as the perpetrators. To the Russians, this is an undeclared act of war by the United States and the IMF is shut down and 'Ghost Protocol' is initiated, which basically means the entire agency is disavowed.From here on in, Hunt and his team are tasked with catching Cobalt, stopping his plans of world destruction and clearing their names. All in a day's work for Ethan Hunt!They travel from Russia, to India, to Dubai where Hunt must perform a death defying climb on the outside of the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Tom Cruise actually did this crazy stunt! He does all his own stunts and he's nearly 50 years old!!! Actors of today need to take a lesson or two from Mr. Cruise, no need for CGI just go out there and do it for real! It looks much more authentic and real if you actually do a stunt, rather than jump in front of a green screen. Hence why director Brad Bird chose to shoot the film in IMAX, not 3D on Tom Cruise's insistence. Bird says 'It truly immerses the audience. It's really bright, it's really sharp. Big, bright images: they are worth a lot. If your star is going to climb up the outside of a building for real, then I kinda feel as a director, you have a duty to show it.'Ghost Protocol is Brad Bird's live action directorial debut, with his previous films being animations (The Incredibles, The Iron Giant & Ratatouille). And I must say, he did a bloody fantastic job! I love my movies big and stylish, and Bird delivered on both these fronts. The action is big and stylish, but not stupidly over the top like in John Woo's films. Yet still realistic, but not destroyed by shaky camera like in a Paul Greengrass film. This is a beautiful movie, the cinematography is utterly gorgeous, adding to the slick and stylish nature of the film.My only two criticisms of Ghost Protocol are;Whilst the film has a bad guy, he isn't really an arch-enemy for Hunt like Phillip Seymore- Hoffman was in MI3. Michael Nyqvist is a brilliant actor, and the writers could've done so much more with his character, instead of killing him off, he could've returned in another Mission film to make life even more difficult for Tom Cruise. But I guess that wouldn't have worked as each film is directed by a different director who brings their own style to the series, so it could've impeded too much on the next director's choices in how he directs the film (If there is a next one, that is...).The second is the nuclear missile which Ethan Hunt stops moments before it crashes into San Francisco. It would've exploded before it got to where it was when Hunt hit the disarm button. Typically, nuclear missiles are air-burst weapons, which means they actually explode in the air above the target. This is to increase the effectiveness of the explosion and push the nuclear blast further so that it is not obstructed by things such as large, heavy buildings. And come on, the missile is moments from collision! Talk about last minute much?To sum up, Ghost Protocol has made me remember why I go to the cinemas to see movies and why I want to be a director. Movies are about entertainment and escapism, and if you can keep an audience captivated for 133 minutes you've done your job. And that is exactly what Brad Bird has done with 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol'. He transported me for 133 minutes into the world of Ethan Hunt and his team, where the mission is bigger than ever, and the stakes are higher than ever! I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would go and see it again and again and again!My rating for 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' is: 9.5/10The link below is to my blog where the original review can be found: http://joshwahr.blogspot.com",9,1,2,21 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The girl with the thrills, kills and disturbing rape scenes
","Based on the best selling novel by Stieg Larsson, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the first film adaptation from the Millennium Trilogy starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapice. I haven't read any of the novels, but after watching this movie, I am going out to purchase them and read them.The characters played by Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapice are superbly acted and were very believable. I was incredibly impressed by their talent and how they were able to portray their characters throughout the film. They definitely deserve an award for their performances.This film was superbly shot, with beautiful cinematography that captures the beauty and desolateness of the island where the film is set. But at the same time, switches dramatically to capture the violent happenings in the film.The violence and horror of the rape and the murder scenes sent chills up my spine, and I found myself sitting in front of the screen without blinking for long periods throughout the movie (something not many movies are able to do).I will be very interested to see the Hollywood remake that is scheduled to be released during 2011 and whether they mutilate a brilliant movie, or if they do it justice.The film is a fast paced thriller and is definitely not for the feint of heart. If you are a fan of the crime/thriller genre, this is a definite must watch!Find the full review and more at:http://ingloriousfiction.tumblr.com",8,1,2,5 February 2011
Taken 2," Disappointed, but expected.
","Let's get this out of the way now. Taken is my favourite film. Ever. So I went into Taken 2 to with expectations; they'd have to up the ante, and not destroy the brand.Taken 2 sits somewhere in the middle of that. The first half of the film tries to build on the characters of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), estranged wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). This half of the film really works, investing you in the characters, even if there are few holes here and there. It really gets you feeling for the characters when the action gets going. Sadly when the action does kick in, it doesn't deliver. New director Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3, Colombiana), who has taken over from the brilliant Pierre Morel, directs with the subtlety of a brick thrown at a glass window. From poorly executed shots, to overly shaky camera work & way too many cuts, the violence and shock of these actions seen in Taken 1 is lost in this film. This also probably has to do with the producers' choice to lower the rating from MA15+ to M15 (or PG13 in America). Their reason for this is to 'broaden the audience', but seeing as the first one is so violent and how you need to see the first one to understand what the hell is going on in Taken 2, this is a stupid move as the kids watching won't be allowed to see the first! Another thing which really bugged me was the colour grading; when Bryan was with his family it was nice and bright, but when we were with the villain (Rade Serbedgia), the film had this overly dark grey look to it which just said 'HE'S A GOOD GUY AND HE'S A BAD GUY!!!'I wasn't expecting much from director Olivier Megaton, whose only other films, The Transporter 3 and Colombiana, both of which are pretty average. But I was expecting a lot more from Luc Besson as producer and writer. I enjoyed the first half of the film, it showed love for the original and really built on the characters, perhaps too much. But sadly I was incredibly disappointed with the second half which was poorly executed and left me thinking 'Really? Is that it?'7/10",7,5,11,7 October 2012
