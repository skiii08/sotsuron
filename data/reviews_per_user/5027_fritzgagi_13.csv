Black Swan," Dark, Sexy, Disturbing, Beautiful
","This movie offers a spectrum of different emotions: on the one hand there's a really creepy nightmareish tension building up and on the other hand there's the beautiful fairytale like world of ballet and of course the oppressed sexuality unraveling from Nina. Whilst it does include a lot of horror movie clich√©s, such as the doppelganger, the mutation, and the changing reflection in the mirror it does feature a lot of very original stuff. The movie is captivating and keeps you trapped in a slightly surreal undertow. Natalie Portmans performance is simply amazing. All in all maybe not revolutionary, but definitely entertaining and touching.",7,0,3,21 January 2011
Se7en," The curious case of John Doe
","A psychopathic killer goes around killing people, staging their death according to one of the seven deadly sins. Two cops are assigned for the case, one is experienced and stoic and one is impulsive and heated. As they investigate the case, they get caught up in the killers game and need to immerse themselves in his psyche.David Fincher orchestrates this film as a pretty straightforward thriller for the most part. The two cops go from crime scene to crime while both of their characters get explored and you get to understand why they work how they do. The dynamic between Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt really works here because neither of them is a cardboard cutout, simply there to convey their respective life mottos, but real three-dimensional human beings, allowing for some genuine conflict. The killer here is a self-perceived messenger of god, on a mission to show everyone how messed up the world has become. Kevin Spacey portrays him as intelligent and seemingly controlled, rather than insane, which you would expect from someone who puts heads in shoe boxes, thus making this villain scary as hell.The ending is plotted perfectly and it thematically rounds up the movie. Although its pacing isn't pulled off as perfectly as its written, its still one of the best endings you'll ever see in a thriller.",8,1,2,12 August 2012
Shakespeare in Love," Good movie that you will forget.
","Shakespeare in Love has all the ingredients for a Best Picture winner: Good actors, beautiful costumes, nice sets, some romance and some funny jokes... Was that enough to make you fall asleep? It's everything you'd expect by looking at the cover, and that's fine, but it's simply not enough for a truly amazing movie. Shakespeare in Love is an entertaining, well written film and at the same time never surpasses the realm of mediocrity.Judi Dench stands out as a hilarious Queen Elizabeth who can act like a goddess without even moving her face and Ben Affleck stands out for being Ben Affleck in the 1500's and thus taking you out of the movie.",7,0,1,26 February 2013
Alien," Great 70s SciFi-Horror Flick
","A crew on a spaceship receives a strange signal and they land on a planetoid. One of the crew members gets attacked by something that appears to be an alien life form. Regardless of the warnings of another member, they escort him back into the ship, along with the alien being. From there on they have to face the threat of being trapped in a ship with the aggressive alien.The camera work and the lightning on this one are amazing. What also makes it unique is the outstanding design of the alien character.The movie builds up very slowly and after a short while creates a very creepy atmosphere. Everyone is sitting on needles knowing that the thing is waiting for them. The characters are very believable. All in all its a more than satisfying movie : A true horror classic.",7,1,1,10 January 2011
Oblivion," 2001: A Space Oblivion
","Oblivion's post-apocalyptic world is extremely nice to look at. There are deserted landscapes, beautiful futuristic buildings and drones and spaceships of an advanced technology. The direction isn't special apart from some crazy zooms. It's obvious that the director has seen 2001: A Space Oddyssey more than once.Tom Cruise delivers a very solid performance, although he doesn't do a whole lot more than being Tom Cruise. The catchy one-liners that he utters are cringe-worthy though. The plot takes some unexpected turns that you wouldn't expect from a Tom Cruise feature. All in all it's a very enjoyable pre-summer Sci-Fi movie.",7,1,3,1 May 2013
The Bourne Identity," Bour-ing
","I was a bit disappointed by this film. Expected a thicker plot, more twists and more locations. Instead the plot remains pretty thin and thus gets stretched out. Storywise there isn't enough material for a 2 hour film. Also, there are virtually no twists and the locations aren't all that exciting. It feels very much like a setup for a larger franchise and can't stand on it's own feet.The two leads lack a distinctive image, even though I liked Matt Damon's presence. Chris Cooper delivers an excellent performance as an aggressive alpha male. Clive Owen also boasts and exceeds Damon's performance without even doing a whole lot.",6,0,1,2 August 2013
The Intouchables," A very heart-felt, human film. Highly recommendable.
","Intouchables is an unusual buddy movie about two guys who couldn't be more opposite of each other. Driss (Omar Sy) just wants to get a rejection paper from Philippe, a quadriplegic aristocrat, so he can receive unemployment benefits. But Philippe has other plans for him: He is immediately under Driss' charm and decides to hire him as his personal nurse.The two bond more and more and that is when the movie shows its strength: It lives from the contrast between the easy-going, charming underclass prankster and the rich, art-loving lord. The collision of these two worlds offers room for plenty of funny material. When the two sit in the opera in a room full of uptight white men in suits, and on stage a man dressed as a tree starts to sing in German, Driss can't hold his back laughter. Neither can the audience of this film.It's a warm, delightful comedy that hits all the right notes, completely politically incorrect and honest. It has a comedic tone throughout the whole film but allows itself to also show the internal conflicts of the two protagonists without ever being sappy. It's a rare thing to see a handicapped person portrayed without too much pathos.Please see this movie. It's beautifully-shot, well written, heartfelt and heartwarming.",8,8,14,5 February 2012
It Follows," Compelling, unique, flawed.
","I'm usually not one to point out minor flaws in an otherwise fine movie. This one has a few of those typical 'people acting stupid in horror movies' moments that might ruin the experience for some. Who goes off alone into the woods after being followed by a murderous creature? Or the scene at the pool, why doesn't she get out of the water that's A.) about to be charged with electricity and B.) has the titular horror monster in it? The second major issue I have with this movie is that it wastes its potential by not solving the riddle it sets up. It doesn't answer any questions about the curse and ends in an all too easy open end.Otherwise this is a well constructed, atmospheric and unique horror movie with a great soundtrack. It moves along at a fast pace and doesn't waste any scene, everything is significant to the story. There are some unique camera shots and angles and everything adds up to a compelling experience, albeit with some minor and one major flaw.",7,2,4,4 January 2016
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic midnight snack.
","Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is like a small but tasty snack. You feel satisfied but not glutted. You had fun but nothing world-shattering has happened.Speaking of world-shattering: mysterious incidents are happening all over the world. A muscular iron-man on a silver surfboard (hence the title) visits earth, while the fantastic couple Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing their wedding, but the bride and groom have to postpone it because the world once again has to be saved.This comic adaptation from Marvel is a fast-paced, fun packed action movie. It's not ashamed to set up a somewhat insane plot and let the superheroes do their campy deed. While the humor does sometimes fall flat and the actors don't have to do more than deliver their (arguably not very-well written) jokes and superhero quirks it's still a very enjoyable one, that's definitely worth watching.",6,0,1,4 February 2012
The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan is the hero we deserve and The Dark Knight is the film we need.
","The Dark Knight is the second part of Christopher Nolan's gritty re-imagination of the Batman saga. The cast of Batman begins stays with the exception of Katie Holmes being replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman's Lucius still supplies Batman with his cool cars and gadgets and Michael Caine still plays Batman's servant Alfred. New to the trilogy is Heath Ledger's psychopathic Joker and Aaron Eckhart's White Knight/Two-Face Harvey Dent.If there's one thing to criticize about The Dark Knight it's something that seems to be an issue in many Christopher Nolan films: The explanatory dialogue. Nolan doesn't always follow the rule 'Show, don't tell' and has his character be stand-ins for the audience, explaining what could be communicated visually. It's a minor flaw though and the only thing taking the viewer out of this otherwise ridiculously great film.Accompanied by Hans Zimmer's score the film moves forward at a steady pace, allowing the story to happen and the characters to develop simultaneously through their actions. The cinematography has epic proportions and the use of action is never unnecessary filler material but a device to move the plot forward, always full of gravitas and feeling like it has actual consequences. Other superhero films need music montages to make the hero look cool. Batman in The Dark Knight is always cool, without the need for artificial coolness, as it should be.The Dark Knight turns the conception of 'The superhero is purely good and fights against the purely evil villain' around. There are always casualties. There's no such thing as a perfect choice that makes the good people happy and the bad people pay for their crimes. The world is unfair and for Harvey Dent's character that's unbearable. Because evil and corruption have taken what he loved most away from him he decided to bring justice to Gotham by making everything happen unbiased, by chance.The Joker brings chaos into the world of the superhero where there should be the good guys and the bad guys. He makes people question their moral and tries to make them believe that they all are like him, maniacs only being held back by society's laws and rules. The courts of Gotham itself is corrupted by the mob so even the place where justice should be isn't safe of bad people and moral injustice. Heath Ledger personifies that idea of anarchy so well and every bit of praise he's gotten is well deserved.In the end Batman cruises through the night, having done his deed, knowing that there is no final justice but that everything he's done has improved morality and justice on the whole. He lets someone else take the fame and goes back into the dark streets of Gotham, waiting for the next maniac to come along, upping his defense and making us want to see if he manages to expel evil in the last part of the trilogy.",9,3,7,1 July 2012
Annie Hall," The neurotic romance
","Annie Hall tells the story of Alvie Singer, played by the big neurotic of cinema himself, Woody Allen, and his relationship with the title-giving Annie. Woody Allen who also directed tells the story through direct-to-camera narration and episodes from his relationship with Annie.Alvie Singer is a neurotic New-Yorker who spends his days lost in confusion, pondering the big questions of life and love. He is continuously looking for something, emotionally and intellectually and makes his living entertaining people as a comedian with his neurotic obsessions. He dislikes the intellectual establishment and instead looks for his own answers. Woody Allen's excellent comedic performance is the center of this fantastic film.He falls in love and gets into a relationship with the singer Annie Hall and as their relationship gets more serious she feels suffocated by his obsessive intellectual urge and looks for a more mellow lifestyle, which Woody Allen's character can't stand. It's unbearable for him to see her turn her back to intellectualism and to a more relaxed lifestyle. In perhaps one of the funniest moments in the film Alvie Singer even tries to replicate his relationship with Annie in a play but instead of her turning her back to him in his version she comes back to his intellectual island because for him it's obvious that that's what the world needs. Looking back on his romance Woody Allen concludes that relationships are always going to be confusing and heart-wrenching and soul-crushing but yet they are an essential part of life and we keep pursuing them. Like Alvie Singer we should always keep pushing forward, explore and get lost. This film is heartbreaking and extremely funny it has excellent dialogue and an outstanding performance and is a must see for anyone who has had his heart broken or will in the future.",9,0,0,5 August 2012
Psycho," Hitchcock's take on horror, dark and terrifying
","A woman escapes with a stolen envelope full of money. She decides to rest in a motel where she meets a mysterious stranger...In this 1960 movie, Alfred Hitchcock clearly approached the horror genre. It feels like a completely new Hitchcock, as if he'd taken his experience from his earlier movies and formed something completely new out of it. No second, no line of dialogue is wasted. Everything is built up to get you on the edge of your seat. As a master of his craft he brings his camera work and his lighting to perfection.This definitely is a ground stone for almost every horror movie that followed.",9,0,0,13 March 2011
True Romance," True movie romance
","In True Romance, director Tony Scott and writer Quentin Tarantino take us on two lovers' journey through a world of crime and romance. The two lovers (Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette) meet in a movie theatre and Tarantino's love for films is present throughout the film. It's pretty safe to assume that Christian Slater embodies at least some part of Tarantino. He keeps his cool, always has a line on his lips and faces off against the criminals, doing everything to defend his girl. True Romance does keep the promise given by it's title. It's a story about a couple wound up in a net of evil guys, backstabbing and a suitcase full of Cola, as the aspiring actor Elliot played by Bronson Pinchot calls it. The world of coke-snorting Hollywood guys and suave Italian mafiosi portrayed in True Romance, feels like a Tarantino world at every moment. In fact the whole film screams Tarantino. It's a romantic film in the sense that it romanticizes this world, and the idea that two lovers can get away from it if they stick together. The dialogue is as always with Tarantino top-notch. The characters are somewhat cartoonish but in the most positive sense. A great cast rounds this experience up, and you just have to love this film as soon as you get to the performance of the pot-smoking slacker version of Brad Pitt.",8,2,4,13 March 2012
