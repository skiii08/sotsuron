The Legend of Bagger Vance," Wooden Actors
","This could have been a better movie, but this cast doesn't pull it off. Will Smith will never be an actor, only a personality, yet we keep seeing him foisted on audiences. His portrayal of a mystical golf guru coming out of nowhere is simply not believable. Matt Damon and Charlize Theron have a fair amount of talent, but this movie does not bring it out of them. Their characters act like stock characters out of central casting, and the result is a boring, plodding film in which you can't wait to reach the end. The film is well done on the technical end with beautiful scenes of the golf course and surrounding areas, but that does not make up for a poor script and uninspired acting. Not one of Redford's best efforts, as I've seen much better from him in the past and know he can do better.",5,1,1,24 June 2014
