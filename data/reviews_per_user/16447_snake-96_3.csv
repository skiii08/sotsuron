Raiders of the Lost Ark," good film
","This was one of the best films i have evver seen, the plot was amazing and the actors played each of their parts well, this film is a classic and should be treated as such, unlike other classic films this one would definitely be the best in my opinion, anyone who gives this film bad ratings or reviews should go back and watch the film, again and again until they can grasp the full concept of the film, no one should ever say a classic like this is rubbish, they should really watch the other Indiana Jones films, just so they can see how the classics have shaped the new Indiana Jones film.but if you are not a fan of these films then please by all means waste money on narnija",Null,0,0,20 June 2008
28 Weeks Later," brilliant film
","this film was brilliant i liked it, i cant wait until they make 28 months later, but this film was defiantly good. one of the Best films i have ever seen.i mean at least they made a sequel to 28 days later which was Good, but i think they should of had Jim and Selina in this film somewhere, to make it a lot better.any one who says this film is rubbish should get a life, i mean come on, its the only decent British film ever made. but i do tend to believe that this sequel was heading in a wrong direction, the fact that people are immune to the rage virus, came as a surprise to me, and i believe this made a good plot twist.",10,0,2,4 December 2007
28 Days Later...," Good film
","this film was ASWOME i mean come on it had lots of drama, and some scenes which scared you, but the choice of setting it in England, that was incredible, and i didn't even for see that Manchester would be set on fire, that was ANMAZING.the actors were right for their roles, but there were some things which had me going 'huh', for example, the scene where he picks up all the money off the floor, what was the point but apart from that this film was very good, just wait for 28 months later to come out, that will be good.the fact that Jim kills the solider by pressing his thumbs into the soldiers eye, that was a good way of killing some one, but Jim is an idiot he let the infected solider get lose and infect the other soldiers. why did he do it",10,1,2,4 December 2007
