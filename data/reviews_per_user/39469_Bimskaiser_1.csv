The Devil's Advocate," Too bad...
","Keanu Reeves can't keep up with all the big name actors in this movie, that would have made it a 10. Charlize Theron deserved more attention for her performance in this picture. Need I say anything about Al Pacino?? The man is an acting GOD (or Devil:) he should have gotten an award for this picture. Keanu does everything I guess what was expected from him, it just seems, he's so uptight and he lacks the necessary looseness and improvisation for this type of movie. He gets the lines desingned for him pretty good, but he's somehow missing the lines in between the lines. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, close to reality in terms of the lawyer business, even the lifestyle of New York is captured, the best thing about the movie however, is still Pacino's performance and the thin red line throughout the movie, which would give away the ending if one would watch VERY VERY closely!",9,1,1,10 March 2006
