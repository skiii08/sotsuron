The Lobster," Still a lot more to do
","Mr Lanthimos and his associates have pulled through a rather difficult theme. The challenge is accepted and undertaken by all the parties and people involved. Technically and aesthetically the film is good - there is a compelling atmosphere and this applies to every aspect of the film. I can think of a couple of filmmakers from the 80s that could have been an influence. Still my idea is there are a lot more to be told. The ending of the film confirms my belief, it is a new beginning.",4,1,2,27 February 2017
Black Swan," This is good
",This film is good not just because Mr. Aronovsky enjoys to torment himself and his actresses. This is much more ambitious. It takes us from the everyday life of an ordinary dancer and takes us higher and higher. We are grateful for that. Only by risking everything it is that you are entitled to take it all. Moreover there is serious psychology involved here - the kind you find in Shakespeare and the classics.,9,1,5,28 February 2017
Alexander," Good to know about him
","The movie is quite faithful to the history - that's the good part. On the other hand as an action film is a failure, it is mostly tiresome and too long. Mr. Stone is obviously striving to show us everything or at least the most possible. Here comes the Greek saying - good is not too much (but less).",6,0,1,21 August 2017
La La Land," Fair
","Could have been worse. Was constantly napping - glimpsing between 25' and 1 32' but generally enjoyed it. Especially beginning and ending. It surely is an art when you are able to create from whatever material but for me there should be more much more. I can never nap - glimpse when I watch certain films no matter how tired or bored I was before. It is one thing to create and be prolific and another to find the target, know what you are talking about, be there and not a passer-by.",6,3,7,28 February 2017
Whiplash," the musician this time
","Another film that has its theme the writer, the musician, the actor, etc. I could find such films amusing if they had some sense of humor - well a lot of humor I'd say. Some spirit of self-reproach, admitting that there are things in this world more important than the writer the actor the performer etc. I prefer the other ballet dancer film a few years ago, it was more real more cruel. I prefer what Bergman used to do.",6,1,4,28 February 2017
Inception," So overrated
",This is a bad film. It is really sad to see so many people work so hard to produce this thing. So fake so pretentious so arrogant so little. Well it is supposed to be an action movie and people love it because they just want to have fun for their buck. Don't get me wrong - I like action in movies but this is so superfluous and boring...,3,5,8,1 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," So pretentious
","Although this movie touches many different issues and obviously makes people think, this is done superficially and not just in a stylish abstract manner as Mr. Inaritu and co. would like. Everything is form here - form is a type of action when there is too much of it, and people love action. Formalism is the term in visual arts. Or more plainly, it is fake - it is all package and wrapping - a consumer product like the macbook and the i phone. No doubt these people admire Steve Jobs.",5,0,2,10 January 2018
Mother!," the poet again
","Mr. Aronofsky stayed on the same topic again this time - the poet. And though it is interesting to watch the whips and scorns of time the poet gets in order to create and afterwards, the result is not so, how to say it, entertaining. 
One may remember other allegoric films, i have a couple on my mind, but again the result is always below whatever expectations. Only one poet has done a good job writing a piece about his entire work so far - Shakespeare in The Tempest. Not everybody is Shakespeare though!",6,0,2,8 March 2018
The Deer Hunter," For every taste
","This film was deliberately made for every taste. That of course is crucial to its success but that does not mean it could not have been better. A lot better I' d say. For example there are so many notes from the Godfather - why would it have to be so? For the recipe of success no doubt. The essential messages of the film are there to be seen of course but they are obscured Mr. Cimino by all that noise. Vietnam scenes are the required noise but the wedding? I don't consider him a master of his means, he just has too many things on his mind and is burnt out eventually. He should watch how the old masters (Henry King) delivered a story even when they had much less to say...",8,0,1,28 July 2018
Gladiator," A lesson in film making
","Although it is primarily an action film and everything else comes to second place, it is a good one. Timing for instance in this movie is just impeccable. The whole works like a well oiled machine that once started stops upon nothing. The first barbarian battle scene is indicative of what is to follow. No doubt Mr. Ridley Scott wields absolute control upon his means like a real master.",8,0,0,20 August 2017
