Insidious: Chapter 2," Not as good as the first one but still a good Horror movie overall.
","Insidious Chapter 2.I really liked Insidious Chapter 1, it was a really good horror movie after a long time in my opinion. When I heard they were making a second part (no surprise there as part 1 ending suggested it clearly), I had some doubts because sequels of Horror movies ALWAYS suck. I'm glad this didn't follow the tradition. The story follows the previous part and all the cast is back. IT was good and answered some of the questions that were raised in the previous part. The horror stuff wasn't that much. Same goes for the atmosphere and tension. I really liked the fact that the two detectives were also back and they had some funny scenes too. Would be awesome if those two can get a whole movie. It wasn't as good as part 1 but still was a good horror movie. James wan sure is a savior of Horror movies in these times. 7/10.",7,2,2,20 January 2014
Captain Phillips," Thrilling movie.
","Based on true events about the first American cargo ship to be overtaken by pirates in a long long time. The ship was under Captain Phillips control, the pirates were Somalian. The event is somewhat recent, taking place in 2009. Now the movie premise is simple enough, ship gets taken, hostage situation, negotiations etc. The execution of it all is great. The movie slowly builds up tension and it continues to do so till the very end. The last hour or so was really tense, I was just keep wondering what will happen, who will survive etc etc. Acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. He was exceptionally great at the last scene, I really felt that moment. The pirates were great too. You actually feel for them as the movie shows you their background (somewhat) and its not a simple good vs bad guy scenario, it could have been more fleshed out though. The soundtrack was good, cinematography was great. 8/10",8,2,4,20 January 2014
John Wick," Keanu Reeves is back.
","Keanu Reeves is back, HELL YEAH!!John Wick is a movie about, well, John Wick, a normal guy whose wife recently died and her dying gift to him was a dog. Theon the d**k less a**hole from Game of thrones was being his usual d**k self in this movie and decides to kill John wick's dog and steal his sweet ass mustang. Little did he know that John wick wasn't just some normal guy. And we get our revenge action movie. You don't kill someone's dog and steal their ride, you just don't. While many people might find the plot stupid or something, let me tell you, there is a lot more to it than a simple revenge tale. The movie knows what it is and executes it perfectly. But underneath all that revenge, there is some really cool world building going on. There are these rules, managements, neutral zones etc, which push John Wick from being just a simple brainless revenge movie. I hope they make sequels to it as there is A LOT of potential for this become an awesome franchise. Coming back to Keanu Reeves, HOLY S***, he was awesome in this movie. Being a Keanu Reeves fan, it is so great to see him finally get a role where he can shine again. The dude kills it as John Wick. He is cool, he is sleek and he is a total Bada**. Hell, he might give Liam Neeson and Matt Damon a run for their money. :p You appreciate him even more knowing that he did 90% of the stunts in this movie. Because of that, the action scenes consisted of long takes instead of the usual quick cuts we see in Hollywood movies and made the action SO MUCH BETTER. Couple that with good cinematography, slick and sleek directing and pumping soundtrack, and you get yourself an awesome RARE action movie. Another thing this movie did well was that even though John Wick is shown to be one of the best or THE BEST in his work, he is not invincible or immortal, at the end, he is a human. Many similar movies forget this point and make their heroes way TOO good that it takes you out of the experience. I really really hope this movie does well enough on the box office that we get a sequel from the same team. Highly recommended if you are looking for an action movie or are a Keanu Reeves fan. 8.5/10",8,9,22,16 January 2015
Gravity," A thrill ride unlike any other.
","I'm still shaken up from what I saw, amazing experience. The movie is a thrill ride unlike any other I have seen. The movie is pretty short, clocking in about 1 hour and 20 mins only. The story is pretty basic and straightforward. A crew of Astronauts are in earth space orbit and something goes wrong, now they are in a fight for their survival. What sets it apart is how it was all executed. There is a good amount of symbolism and hidden meaning in this movie. Stuff like Acceptance, Moving on etc. Sandra Bullock gave a pretty good performance as a terrified Astronaut struggling to survive. George clooney was his usual charming self, he has perfected that role. From the get go, you'll see that the movie is breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL. The cinematography is amazing, the CGI is amazing, the scenery is amazing, it just melts your eyes. One of the best looking movie ever. The views of Earth are oh so mesmerizing. The action/destruction scenes are really thrilling and impactful. You don't hear anything (no sound in space), just see stuff getting shredded and destroyed in an awesome yet terrifying way. There is just something very eerie yet great about how it was handled, LOVED IT. The soundtrack is equally amazing. It switches from beautiful emotional score during emotional or mesmerizing scenes from really tense and thrilling score during action/destruction scenes, enhancing everything to a new level. Make sure to watch it in HD with a good sound system, lights off and no disturbances. It enhances the experience, trust me. The immersion factor in this movie matters a lot. I only wish I could have seen it in Cinema in 3D.One of the best movie of last year and one of the most visually stunning movie EVER. Definitely a BLU-RAY buy for me. 8.8/10",9,1,3,14 January 2014
Lone Survivor," Brutal and Awesome.
","This film took me by surprise. I was not expecting it to be this good especially considering the guy who directed this (Peter Berg) also directed Battleship. Based on a true story, it is about a group of four US Navy seals on a mission in Afghanistan to hunt down a Taliban leader and it goes horrible wrong. What I really liked about the movie was how brutal and realistic it felt. Seriously, there were times when I was cringing and saying 'OUCH' etc. Pretty brutal stuff they went through and it is portrayed in a great way. The cinematography was great and really made these scenes epic. The movie also doesn't depict Afghanistan as just plain EVIL all round and US soldiers being the good heroes. The last act was really refreshing for me and it became even more awesome considering it was based on True story. There is some cheesiness here and there that you usually get with war type movies and the character establishment of Mark Wahlberg and other guys at the start could have been better and longer. Also, it did felt very realistic during war scenes BUT there were a few occasions where it became kinda hard to believe they survived that much punishment.Overall, a great film and a must watch.8/10",8,2,5,16 March 2014
Green Room," A refreshing watch in this genre
","Green Room is a movie about a young small-time band getting a gig in some shady place and they find themselves in a sticky situation there after accidentally witnessing a murder. I thought this will be another run of the mill slasher gore-fest flick where stupid kids die one by one, but was pleasantly surprised to see the execution. I mean the story is what you'd expect from such film, and the basic formula is similar, but the way they presented and flowed it was somewhat refreshing. The flow of the movie was its defining part for me. It felt natural, giving the situation a realistic feel and creating an ever present feel of tension when things go down. The movie wasn't super violent or gore-y just for the sake of it either. It was a bit tamed, and the way violence was presented made you feel uneasy, like it should. And being named as 'Green Room', there was an overall green tint in the visuals, a nice touch. Some of the acting was really good, like from Anton Yelchin (Rest in Peace) and Imogen Poots, AND of course Patrick Stewart as the main villain. Wish he had more scenes being all evil and stuff. But some of the other cast wasn't always good. And of course, character make stupid decisions, some that feel fine considering the situation while some were just plain dumb. And with the movie focusing on providing realism, there were scenes which felt totally off from it, breaking the immersion and tension and taking me out of the movie for that duration, which is a shame as if those scenes weren't present, this could have been a solid great watch. Still, it is enjoyable nonetheless. And if you are into these types of movies, then I definitely recommend it. 7.5/10",7,1,4,10 August 2016
Spotlight," Great ensemble cast
","'If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it.'It is amazing to see how much is buried under the rug in the world. Spotlight is a movie based on a true story about a special division in the Boston Newspaper called by the same name, who stumble upon a story that just shakes their very core. A great ensemble, I mean we got Micheal Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery and more. And all of them were at the top of their game. Great performances by everyone. And the movie took a very subdued approach to it. You see these people just doing their job, they are not portrayed as big heroes or anything, and as the case gets more deep, you see subtle expression of disgust/shock/worry on their faces, with increasing intensity. It just felt very realistic. The movie did felt slow at times. The pacing was almost constant but I guess the nature of the movie made some parts feel slow. Not boring though, just a bit slow. I didn't really know what the movie was about and that kinda made it more interesting as the movie kept on going, so it is better I don't talk about it. All I'll say is that the more it went on, the more shocked I was that it all actually happened. 8/10",8,0,0,27 January 2016
Black Mass," A comeback for Johnny Depp
","'It's not what you do, it's when and where you do it, and who you do it to or with. If nobody sees it, it didn't happen.'Black Mass is a film based on true story about a gangster named Whitey Bulger, who makes a deal with the FBI to take down his competition.Now I was really looking forward to watching this because it looked like this will be the comeback of Johnny Depp, and it certainly was. All the acting was top notch but Johnny Depp was the obvious standout. His portrayal of the gangster was chilling, intense and at times creepy. He was again wearing tons of makeup but it added rather than distracting. Easily his best work in years.The movie was also really well shot. Great cinematography. This, and Johnny Depp's acting really made some scenes really great and intense, and made you go 'I want more of those'. And I wish we had gotten more such scenes instead of the other stuff we got.The problem with this movie was that it lacked focus in its story. Events are happening but you don't really feel invested in them. Most of it felt empty. There was no emotional attachment to it. The whole movie had this anti-climatic feel to it. You get scenes with great performances and all but the linkages don't carry out well. It was also predictable at times.In the end, you just get this hollow feeling, like there was no payoff, and that was a disappointment because the movie definitely had the potential to be a great gangster film. The acting was great, the premise was interesting and it was shot really well. And is definitely worth a try for that, just don't get your hopes up for this being something spectacular.7/10",7,0,0,20 October 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Now this is how you do a sequel.
","Now this is how you do a sequel. Captain America: The First Avenger was my least favourite movie from Avengers Phase one, this is easily my favourite movie from phase two. We are shown how the captain is dealing with living in current times and working for shield. He is a real bad ass in this one. Even if you never liked Captain America's character before, I'm guaranteeing it that you'll like him after watching this movie. The story was really good and gripping. Had some really good twists and turns. It wasn't just a superhero movie, it was more like a conspiracy/political/Action Thriller with a superhero in it and that really made it different from other Marvel superhero movies and I loved it for it. Chris Evans upped the ante as Captain America, he was great in this. Even more awesome was how fleshed out Black widow, played by Scarlet Johansson, and Nick fury, played by Samuel L Jackson, were in this movie. Both got their best roles respectively so far in MCU movies. Nick fury was plain BAD ASS. And black widow has come a long way from that typical robotic spy-ish character from Iron man 2. Her character was great in the Avengers and it was greater still in this. The chemistry between her and cap was nice too. We are introduced to a new character too, Falcon, who acts like a buddy to cap, and he was pretty good. The winter soldier was a pretty good villain. His presence was powerful and fearful and was always accompanied by a great score. Wished he got more screen time though. The action scenes were AMAZING. Hand to hand fights, car chases, gun fights, aerial combat, you name it, ALL were just awesome to watch and really made up for the lack of action in the first part. Soundtrack was pretty good.The only thing I didn't like was that there was no mention of Hawkeye. I mean he works for Shield so they should have at least come up a with a line or two to tell us that why isn't he helping out etc. That and no Agent Coulson, he was like the go-to familiar guy in MCU movies, not having him this time was sad. The events of this film have made the wait for Avengers 2 even more hard. It is one of the best movie of the year so far and one of the best MCU movie. Aside from Iron man 3, phase two has been really strong. Highly recommended. 8.7/10",8,1,3,6 August 2014
Interstellar," Nolan's Most Ambitious Project Yet.
","'Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.'IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again. This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father- Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too. Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded. Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets. The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end. Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer on screen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years. 9.5/10",9,2,8,22 November 2014
American Hustle," Highly Overrated.
","American Hustle. The movie is about a con artist and his partner who are given a deal with the FBI for their freedom. This movie had an all star cast. You have Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renners, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. All of them delivered good performances, Christian Bale especially. He even gained weight for this role, got out of shape, that dude is a hard core actor, definitely deserves an Oscar Nod.The movie execution was sloppy because it just left me unsatisfied. Seriously, when it finished, I was like that's it?? There were some great moments here and there but overall it wasn't that interesting, especially considering I watched it after Wolf Of Wall Street. I liked that the movie focused more on the characters and they were likable, with a better execution, it could have been a great one.It has a 90 on metacritic and 93% on rotten tomatoes, VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED. Still a good movie overall. 7.5/10",7,3,6,20 January 2014
Divergent," I surprisingly good teen novel adaptation.
","I really didn't expect this movie to be any good. Thought of it as just another teen novel turned into a movie like Twilight. Surprisingly, the movie was pretty good. I loved its premise. A post apocalyptic world where Chicago is like Mankind's last safe place left surrounded by a huge wall. A five factions system ensures that no further war ever takes place. Kinda reminded me of Equilibrium and Hunger games. The story was pretty good. It follows a girl who tries to find her role in this faction system. The actress who played her did a fine job in my opinion. Liked her slow transformation, it was one of my favourite thing about the movie, her whole journey after joining a faction of her choosing, it was really good. Kate winslet plays the main baddie and she was pretty good. The rest of the cast was from okayish-lame. There were some emotional scenes here and there too, some executed perfectly, while others hastily.The CGI was a mixed bag. Some shots were good, while many weren't. Didn't distract much from the movie so that's a plus. Liked the soundtrack, had some nice pieces. The main dude was very generic however and just wasn't good for the most part. Also, the movie had some pacing issues, it often slowed down. And then there was the LOVEY DOVEY stuff that you get in these teen novels movie adaptations, never liked em and didn't liked it this time either. Still, a pretty good flick worth checking out. 7.5/10",7,0,1,5 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A perfect mix of first MI film and Ghost Protocol.
","Being the FIFTH part of a franchise, initially I had some doubts about this film. But after seeing the good reception it got, my hopes were up and rightfully so. Rogue Nation continues off from where Ghost Protocol left, with Ethan Hunt getting a new mission to take down the rogue spy agency called the Syndicate. Tom Cruise is well, Tom Cruise. He was awesome yet again. The one that was surprisingly great was the female lead, Rebecca Ferguson. She acted great, she was sexy, she was lethal and she was a total badass. Best MI girl to date. Her chemistry with Tom Cruise was also great and it is one of those VERY rare times where I ACTUALLY liked the romance/lovey dovey subplot. Movie handled it very well. It wasn't prolonged or anything, it wasn't cheesy or clichéd or typical, it was just right. The supporting cast was also great. Simon Pegg's character once again showed how to handle comic relief properly in a movie. He was funny, he was awesome and he wasn't just there to make us laugh. I was disappointed that in Ghost Protocol, Ving Rhames only had a small cameo but gladly he returns here properly. I always loved his character and this time it was no different. Jeremy Renner also returns, and gets a less action role, but is still great. The team dynamic, one of the best things about this series, was strong as ever in this part. This franchise, however, always struggled with its villain and it happened yet again this time. He wasn't bad or anything, but I just felt like the mysterious and a match for Ethan hunt feel they were going for/hoping for didn't work for me. And the his voice definitely didn't help. Philip Seymour Hoffman (R.I.P) in MI3 remains the best villain. Now, the movie felt like a perfect mixture of two of my favourite Mission Impossible films, first part and Ghost protocol. It had the humor, action and epic feeling of MI4 and the more focus on espionage and mystery of the MI1. The action scenes were awesome. The break-in scenes were tense and gripping. The hand to hand combat had impact and were well handled. And the stunt work was amazing. No MI movie is complete without at least one scene containing cruise in some crazy stunt and this was no exception. He hung on the outside of a plane while it took off, and the dude is in his 50s, I mean WOW. The humor was well handled here, just like it was in Ghost Protocol. They didn't overuse it or mistimed it. Some of it was just too good. I laughed out loud a time or two. Overall, this might very well be my favourite MI film so far. One of the best film of this year. A MUST WATCH!! 8.5/10",8,0,2,10 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-men movie to date.
","Bryan Singer is back and at the top of his game. After directing two great Xmen movies (X-men 1 and X-men 2), he was out of the game. But after 11 years, he came back and delivered THE BEST X-MEN MOVIE TO DATE. He even managed to undo the damage done by X-men 3 in a glorious way. The future of the franchise looks brighter than ever. Days of future past takes place well into the future where mutants are being driven to extinction by extremely powerful machines. To avert this, they send back Logan (Wolverine) back in time to stop this from ever happening. That's the main premise and although it is nothing new, Singer delivered it with perfection and I love time travel stories anyway. And Because of this story, a lot of problems have been fixed but I can't go into details because that will be spoilerish. :pThis movie is like a gift to X-men movie franchise fans. There are so many references to all the movies that came before it. Since majority of the movie takes place in the past, cast of X-men: First class is also back and seeing both the older versions and younger versions of famous characters from previous parts in one movie just has its own feeling. Think of it like The Avengers of X-men franchise. You know all the main characters, their back stories etc. They don't waste time introducing them again, they just role with it. And all the actors were at the top of their game. Hugh jackman, James Mcavoy, Michael Fassbender etc all were awesome. This movie has a very helplessness tone in it and you really do feel the need of hope for these characters, especially the future ones because those Sentinels (machines) are scary powerful and are depicted perfectly. It has some great FEELS scenes too. I was so overwhelmed in some scenes. IT is not all dark and feelsy though, there is some good amount of humor and light areas thrown in too, timed greatly. Few movies blend so many different tones in such a great way. Great action sequences and pretty good CGI. Soundtrack is good. It was so awesome to hear X-men 2 main theme song again during the openings. Would have been great if they somehow used First class soundtrack too in some areas. Overall, if you loved X-men movies or even remotely liked them, this is A TREAT for you. One of the best comic book movie, easily the best X-men movie and best movie of the year so far for me. Just one advice before watching it though, do yourself a favor and rewatch all the previous parts before watching this to refresh your memory (Maybe you can skip X- men: Origins), you'll thank me. :p And there is an after credit scene so be sure to wait for that.9/10",9,0,1,25 May 2014
Non-Stop," An OK thriller flick.
","Another movie with Liam Neeson as the though guy. He is like the epitome of older tough guys. :pThis movie starts out like any other movie based on a plane. But then the plot kicks in. It slowly, and I mean really slowly, builds up and manages to keep you interested for the most part. I didn't have a clue where the plot was going and that was a good thing. Unfortunately, the interest it had created in me started to fade away about halfway through, maybe a bit more. And the end result was really disappointing. It was a real bummer because initially the movie was looking really good.Acting is pretty good. Liam Neeson does what he does best. Julianne Moore and the other cast was pretty good. There was this really cool scene where it is just one LONG shot and Liam Neeson is searching for the villain. I love nicely executed long shots.Overall, an OK thriller flick, with LIAM NEESON. 6.5 (0.5 for Liam Neeson :p )",6,0,1,29 May 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A sequel worthy of the amazing first title.
","'A man who kills without reason cannot be reasoned with.'The sequel to one of my favourite animated film lives up to its predecessor. Another amazing achievement in animation by DreamWorks studios, kudos. The movie takes place five years after the events of the first film. Everyone is now grown up, everything's more mature, including the film. The first half or about first 40 mins or so was good, some action here, some humor there etc, but nothing outstanding or great (except for Hiccup and Toothless scenes, which are always great), felt lacking, especially when compared to the first part. I guess, main reason for that was that the novelty of first time experience, the build up of relationship of hiccup and toothless etc in the first part was just too good to overcome for the sequel. BUT no worries, it is the second half which just blows everything away. The movie takes a MUCH darker turn there, delivers lots of FEELS, heart pumping epic action and some truly awe-inspiring moments. Goosebumps galore in the final moments, suffice to say I was extremely pleased when the film was over, had this awesome feeling that you feel when you have watched an amazing film. The animation quality, which was already amazing in the first part, has been further improved. Easily one of the best I have seen. Can't wait to own the Bluray and enjoy the awesome eye candy. The soundtrack, which was one of the main things about the first part that made me fell in love with it, was again great here, although lack of my favourite pieces of the score from first part .i.e 'Romantic flight' and 'Forbidden Friendship' was a bit disappointing. Overall, it is possibly the best animated film sequel I have ever seen, and is the favourite film of this year for me alongside X-men: Days of future past. 9/10",9,5,10,7 September 2014
Mr. Nobody," Thought provoking
","'Every path is the right path. Everything could've been anything else. And it would have just as much meaning.'Mr. Nobody is a movie which shows the multiple possibilities a young boy's life could turn out when he is faced with a choice at a critical moment in his life.The movie shows different timelines/possibilities where the life of the boy could head to depending on certain choices, all with their ups and downs. Some were more joyous than others, some more depressing, some more heartfelt etc. While it is impossible to show all the possibilities, the movie did it best to show as much as possible in the time frame it had without getting too crammed up or rushed.Jared Leto plays the lead and gives a great performance, not surprisingly. And the accompanying cast also gives an almost universal good performance.The movie does have this 'Inception confusion' effect where different stuff happening at different times could confuse the viewer and in addition to that, the movie has this thick layer of coat containing philosophical questions, science theories etc that one could delve deep into searching for more meaning or whatever, but in the end, the core of the movie is rather simple.This movie really gripped me from the start and it didn't felt nearly as long as its 2 and half hour run-time. The cinematography was pretty nice and some illustrations, like the future world shown, was great.A great watch which I would definitely recommend.8.3/10",8,3,4,20 October 2015
The Theory of Everything," Oscar worthy performance and a heartfelt biopic.
","'There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.' -Stephen Hawking.This film is Biopic/Drama+Romance about the famous theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Stephen Hawking. I really admire the guy and it was great to see that the movie did a great job of bringing his life story to the big screen. The main reason I admire him so much is the fact how he battled being diagnosed with ALS/Motor Neuron disease from his early age, defying the impossible and contributing greatly to the world of physics and cosmology. One of the greatest mind of our time. The film's main focus is not the achievements or genius of Hawking, but his relationship with his wife and his/their fight against the disease. IT is a really heartfelt story.It is hard enough to play as a Genius in movies since they mostly tend to be a bit socially awkward in one way or another, but it is a whole another thing to portray the effects of the said disease, and the decline into worse stages. And Eddie Redmayne did just that. He was just breathtaking in his performance. Not only does he look very similar to Hawking's younger self, he gave one of the best performance I HAVE EVER SEEN. It was like you were seeing Hawking himself. Last year has been full of great performances, but after watching this film, I'm fully supporting Redmayne for the best Actor Oscar, by far the best performance of last year. Beside Redmayne, Felicity Jones, who plays Hawking's wife, also gave a stunning performance. Not only that, she also stole away my heart, new celebrity crush. I don't know but I just found her immensely beautiful. The supporting cast was also great and contributed greatly in telling this tale and in heartfelt moments.Soundtrack was another thing that I really found captivating in this film. Was very well composed. The only complaint of mine with this film, just like The Imitation Game, is that I would have loved if they showed more of his work or genius workings.Whether you like Hawking or not (Can't see how can you not like him), or whether you even know about him or not, definitely give this movie a try. 8.5/10",8,0,0,5 February 2015
Frozen," A heartwarming feature.
","I hate musicals, I really do. Never liked them. But when it comes to animation, I am more forgiving but still I do not prefer them. Frozen I must say is a pretty darn good one in this case. The story is a heartwarming sisterhood bond at its core layered with frozen fantasy. And it was handled pretty well. You cannot help but enjoy and delve into it. IT is refreshing to see a female lead animated movie that is well told. Both the sisters are great and have good character development and are very likable, especially the younger one. And that is mainly because of awesome voice acting by Kristen bell. I just loved it. Other characters were good too. Really liked that living snowman, he was really funny. The animation was great. The frozen stuff looked awesome. Also, Disney sure knows how to make great looking female characters. Both the sisters were beautiful. I feel like I have a crush on both of them. :p :pThe soundtrack was pretty good with some great pieces in it. Most of the songs were good too. Let it go especially, by far my favourite one in the movie. That being said, the frequency of the songs was a little too much and it was really annoying. There were certain moments where they really shouldn't have added a song. Overall, a very good heartwarming animated film.7.8/10",7,3,6,5 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Ben Stiller's finest work yet.
","'Beautiful things don't ask for attention.'WOW. I was completely floored by this film. Seeing how Ben Stiller directed this film and starred in it, I was expecting a decent comedy with some normal story or something. But what I got was SO SO MUCH MORE!!The story was really good. It was one of those feel good type stories, and it really brings you in it and doesn't let go till the end, feeling all happy and satisfied and mushy. Ben Stiller was awesome in this film. It was really surprising to see him in a not-so-comedy role. The rest of the cast was good too. Sean Pean's little screen time was utilized perfectly. That whole scene with him had this awesome feel to it.The cinematography in this film was great. The shots of Iceland and Afghanistan (or whatever place it was actually shot in) were immensely beautiful. These shots were complemented by a great soundtrack and the combination just swept me away. BEAUTIFUL!!The movie might seem slow for the first 30 mins or so but don't let that turn you off. This movie blossoms into a beautiful adventure that will surely mesmerize you. Hats of to Ben Stiller for delivering something great and different from his style.8.5/10",8,1,2,14 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Best Spidey movie so far.
","The Amazing Spiderman 2.I enjoyed the previous part and because of that my hopes were high for the sequel. Thankfully, the movie delivered.The movie continues the plot of Peter's family and shows more about his dad in this movie and what happened to him etc. It also continues Peter's relationship with Gwen. I thought the plot was good. Sure it felt like it was just a set up to SOMETHING BIG that we will get in the sequels but still, it was good. Some pacing issues here and there but didn't bother me that much. The movie has a humorous tone most of the time but it does get Dark and emotional at times. Adrew Garfield just kills it as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He upped his game from the previous part and it really shows here. The gorgeous Emma Stone also upped her game as Gwen stacy. And as the movie focuses A LOT on their relationship, it was great to see how awesome their chemistry was, improved from the previous part. Hell, I'll even say they are probably the best comic book movie couple. And that is a great thing because much of the plot relied on it. As for the villains, well Jamie Fox was pretty good as Electro. Dane Dehaan was awesome as Harry Osborn, he is a great actor. Wished there were more of the Goblin though as he only had a cameo of sorts in this movie. Seems like the next part will be pretty BIG. The action is awesome in this movie. Best looking spidey scenes in the franchise so far. Loved everyone of them. Spiderman humor made them more awesome. Great CGI. Electro looked pretty cool.Soundtrack was good. The track that was used whenever Electro was on screen was great. That techno/dubstep flowed greatly with Electro as he himself is electricity. :pDon't really get the hate it got from many people. It is in my opinion the BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE to date. The Amazing spider 2 is indeed AMAZING. 8.3/10",8,4,12,6 June 2014
Ex Machina," Really overrated. BUT still a decent sci-fi thriller nonetheless.
","I love movies, or anything in general, dealing with artificial intelligence and the like. It is such an interesting realm to me. Ex Machina is a film about a young programmer in a big company comparable to Google, who wins a lottery of sorts, which entails him to stay at the Boss's place and be a part in his latest project, A.I. There aren't many characters in this movie and for a movie like this to be interesting, the few characters HAVE to do a great job. The main dude was the only one who I felt like wasn't that good. Oscar Isaac, who plays the Boss/Genius, was awesome. He wasn't your typical rich/boss/genius douche. The one who stole though was Alicia Vikander, who plays the A.I Ava. She did a great job of depicting a high level artificial intelligence. Now the movie really doesn't get into much introduction or world building. It actually felt really rushed in the beginning and just takes our protagonist to the place where rest of the movie will unfold. And that MAGIC of A.I was kinda missing. But afterwards, it very slowly starts to create tension. There is nothing but conversations but you can feel the tension building up and up and things often revealed aren't what they seemed. The pacing sometimes did become snail like though. The ending felt somewhat anti-climatic but at the same time, all the slow build up tension got released in the same slow manner and had this really chilling sensation. Best thing about this movie for me were the questions like What it means to be human? How this technological world defines each and everyone of us etc etc. Stuff like this makes you go deep in thought long after the movie is finished. I do think that people are really overrating it. A decent sci-fi thriller nonetheless. 7.2/10",7,0,2,25 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Leave it to Marvel to make something like this work.
","The movie is about an extremely oddball group of beings who are brought together by circumstances and have to work as a team to accomplish their own goals. There is Peter Quill, the self proclaimed Starlord and the only human in the group, Gamora, a green skinned alien assassin, Drax, a very literal tough berserk alien, Groot, a walking Tree and my favourite, Rocket, a raccoon. Leave it to Marvel to make it all work with glorious results. Not two, not three but FIVE main characters and this movies somehow manages to pull it off. It kinda did it one movie what Avengers did with six movies. Every character gets their fare share of character development and screen time. The villain was however a typical super hero villain though, which was a shame considering how great everything else is in the movie. The pacing was great, you either were laughing, were being entertained by action or were being drawn in by the drama. I believe Marvel has perfected humor in action movies. It was just SO GOOOD in this, better than most comedies out there. I laughed a LOT during the whole movie. It was nothing over the top or crude/toilet humor or anything like that, it was just plain old good humor with PERFECT delivery. What's even more amazing is that how well the humor was blended with action and drama. I think this is the epitome of how comedy should be added in blockbusters. Kudos to Marvel and James Gunn (Director). The action scenes were great and very entertaining. The CGI was amazing. The soundtrack was mostly old 70's and 80's song, which went with plot of the movie and really worked well. Simply put, This is just PURE ENTERTAINMENT. You'll enjoy the heck out of this movie. One of the best Marvel (MCU) movie, and one of the best of this year so far (Amazing summer season). 9/10",9,1,7,15 September 2014
Jurassic World," Entertaining and Thrilling, even if it doesn't reach the same heights as the Original.
","'Monster is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.'We finally get to go back to Isla Nublar after all these years (22 to be exact). It is a given that creating the same feel and magic of Jurassic Park is impossible. SO instead of just trying to recreate everything and doing it in a lesser way, director Colin Trevorrow went with a different approach and it actually payed off. Jurassic World takes place 22 years after the events of the original film. A new park after the events of the original film, on the same place, was opened and has been functioning for 10 years. They create a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction but everything goes to hell when it gets loose. Now, I had somewhat low expectations going into the movie and while it wasn't as good as the original, nor did it had its magic and feeling (obviously), it turned out to be a whole another entertaining ride. The movie did a good enough job of paying homage to the original. Couple of scenes had the awesome John William's original score and they just had this very nostalgic and awesome feeling to it. I just wished they used more of it, and some of it in a better way. Chris Pratt was great as the lead. This guy just has a natural charisma about him and the character he played was likable and badass. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard character as well. She seemed like a typical corporate emotionless being at first but actually developed into something likable. Another thing that was surprising was that the KIDS DID NOT ANNOY ME. Something that rarely happens in movies. Their brotherly bond stuff went fine with the movie. Other characters were either OK or a huge miss.As mentioned earlier, the director went with a different approach. The movie was more of a summer blockbuster monster film, with some of the Jurassic Park elements to it. Many fans might be disappointed by this fact but I was fine with it. Better to have a generic/typical entertaining film instead of a lame recreation attempt. The greatly teased indominous-rex, the hybrid dinosaur, was awesome. The movie did a great job of showing it as this unstoppable monster science and corporate greed created. It was smart, it was ruthless and it was what a monster should be like. The raptors, which have always had huge importance in Jurassic Park franchise, were yet again great here. The whole training them scenario was risky and I didn't know what to expect from it but the way movie handled it was really pleasing. The dinosaur scenes ranged from good to great, with the finale being OH SO SATISFYING. Seriously, my inner dinosaur/Jurassic Park fan was screaming with joy in the last 10-15 mins. The CGI was mostly great. There were some inconsistencies here and there but they weren't that distracting. The soundtrack, apart from the original's, wasn't that great or unique or memorable though. Now the movie definitely had plot issues. I mean the whole idea of creating a hybrid dinosaur because the park is losing its spark sounded really absurd. Also, there were some really stupid moments, created for the convenience of moving the film forward, where you just can't let it slide. Also, the movie had this synthetic feel to it in a lot of scenes. I guess it was because of the lighting and too much use of CGI. It didn't had that gritty and naturalistic feel of the original. All in all, the movie had its quirks but I still had a good time with it. It was entertaining and thrilling, just like how a summer blockbuster should be. Whether you're a fan of the original or just wanna have a good time, this is a must watch. 7.8/10",7,4,11,25 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Filled with flaws and yet I still enjoyed the hell out of it.
","'Everyone creates the thing they fear. Men of peace create engines of war. Avengers create invaders. Parents create children, that will supplant them.'It's the kind of movie that I had great time with, even though I will agree to it having tons of flaws. Lets start with the story, it was mostly a mess. Throughout the movie, it felt like so much stuff have been crammed into a runtime obviously not enough for it. Pacing was a hit and a miss. There were some stuff that was really rushed while other sequences dragged on. Ultron creation and character development in particular was rushed like hell, something that would have benefited greatly from getting more screen time. Also, whole thing between Bruce and Natasha felt forced and out of place. Their scenes really dragged on. It would have been better if they went with Natasha and Steve instead as they had great chemistry in Winter Soldier. It just felt like the whole movie needed more time to be polished out, smooth out the rough edges. While the story was a mess, the character set wasn't. The returning cast was great as usual, bringing their superhero A game. You could feel that they have been a team for a while now, having more chemistry with each other, cracking more jokes and poking more fun at each other etc. New additions, although a bit rushed, were pretty good. Vision, in particular, I felt was handled nicely. Scarlett Witch was hot (I love Elizabeth Olsen :p ) and Quicksilver always looked cool thanks to his power. Some great developments occurred character wise. Hawkeye finally had a notable presence, something that was dearly missing before.Ultron was amazing. James Spader voice really made the character shine. I loved how he had more of a personality then being just a evil bad guy. He had so many great lines, often humorous. I was not actually expecting it as the trailers were really misleading, but it was welcomed nonetheless. Ultron stole every scene he was in but it's a shame he didn't had that much screen time in the movie. Also, he was nerfed like hell. Would have been cool if he actual put on a proper beating to the avengers, shook em bad and all, would have really improved the atmosphere of the movie. Speaking of atmosphere, this is yet another movie falling victim to its misleading trailers. The trailers made me believe it would be a more serious sequel, but it wasn't. Hell, it had more humor than the first part. Joss whedon signature humor was sprinkled throughout the movie. And I actually enjoyed most of it as they had great timing and execution. Marvel movies have this thing being lite and enjoyable and I'm all with it. Many of it were the little things between the team that just made you like them more. But there were moments where toning down the humor would have been seriously great. The presence of Ultron that I wanted never reached that level as one liners and other laughs kept blocking it. That fear or hopelessness never arrived, and it was really disappointing. Action though, was AMAZING. And there was lots of it. Well shot, directed and choreographed. It was handled much better this time as compared to the previous part. And the awaited Hulk vs HulkBuster fight was a feast for the eyes. So much epicness, such carnage and pure destruction. The fanboy in me was crazy happy. CGI was top notch, they spared no expense. Soundtrack was good, although nothing special. Main theme of Avengers, which I love, was back, but was underutilized. It is a given that there is no way to replicate that special and unique feeling of first part of having your favourite superheroes in one movie and acting as team. I found the first Avengers to be better overall. Despite its flaws though, I still found this movie to be a great one. I immensely enjoyed this film, had a great time at the theater and already are getting craving for a second viewing. If nothing else, it is still pretty entertaining. An extended cut with and alternate ending has been announced and it will be released with the BluRay. I believe it could solve many of the issues I have with this film. Can't wait to get my hands on the BluRay. If you're a Marvel fan, have been following the MCU movies and like this Universe, there is no doubt you will like/love this movie. Go watch it. 8.3/10",8,3,8,3 May 2015
Everest," A solid film despite its shortcomings.
","'Human beings simply aren't built to function at the cruising altitudes of a seven-forty-seven.'Everest is a film based on the true story of a tragic disaster that befell an adventure club on their expedition to summit Mount Everest in 1996. The cinematography is great in the movie. Some pretty breathtaking shots of Mount Everest and other areas of Nepal. Along with this, the soundtrack was just as good, making it a real treat to watch at times.The movie has a big cast comprising great actors like Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Jason Clarke, Keira Knightly etc and all of them did a good job. Jason Clarke especially was great and made me care for him. It didn't sugar coat the events nor it added tons of extra stuff for entertainment to appeal to the wider audience. It took it self seriously and honestly, by the time it was over, I was pretty sad, even though it actually did a not-so-good job at developing the characters.And coming to that, it was my main problem with the movie along with that the pacing was uneven and the script was weak, giving the great ensemble hardly anything to work with. It rushes in the earlier scenes where it should have taken A LOT more time to develop the characters because with so many of them in the movie, we hardly get to know them or care for them and hence makes the subsequent events less impactful. The journey to the summit could have also benefited from more development and the release could have been so immense. Regardless of its short comings, it was a solid film. Just feels like a bummer that it could have been much better if they did a little more in it. Oh and keep a blanket or heater nearby cause you can get really chilly while watching this movie. 7.5/10",7,0,1,25 November 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Special effects extravaganza.
","It is what it is, 2 and a half hour of explosions and robots kicking each other's asses. And fairly enough, that is what I wanted and thoroughly enjoyed the experienced.Lots of awesome destruction and action scenes. CGI effects are top notch. The soundtrack is pretty good.I actually really loved the first film, but this one went too far with certain things. The plot is all over the place, pacing is off at times and MAN the humor sucks. Part 1 had a more grounded humor, this one totally went overboard with it. 7/10",7,1,5,12 July 2009
12 Years a Slave," Brutal and Unforgiving.
","A great film, based on a true story, centered around a man tricked into Slavery during those times in USA. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the protagonist who is a free black man but is tricked into slavery. His acting was just Amazing. There are lots of great actors in this movie like Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender, each given a certain amount of screen time and role and each gave a great performance, especially Fassbender, his role as an evil master was brilliant, I can smell Best supporting Oscar Nod for him. The movie really makes you feel how precious freedom is. The situation of slaves, their livelihood, their condition is very well portrayed. The movie can get very brutal and unforgiving at times. The cinematography was great. The soundtrack was great too, ranging from great emotional pieces too twisted dark themes. Definitely a must watch but not for the light hearted who can't stand brutality and stuff. 8.4/10",8,3,8,20 January 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise still got it.
","Tom Cruise still got it. Last year it was Oblivion and now this. The movie is about an Alien Invasion and an all out attempt by Humanity to wipe em out. The protagonist, played by Tom Cruise, during the battle dies and wakes up a day before and finds out that whenever he dies, he wakes up at that point. The concept isn't new or anything BUT it is the first time I'm seeing it applied to an Alien invasion sci- fi film, which just makes it a unique experience and a breath of fresh air. The movie is well directed. It has good pacing and some really good action scenes. The aliens themselves are great. Loved their design and agility. Not your typical aliens, they were really menacing.Tom Cruise was of course great as the lead, and was joined by Emily Blunt who was pretty good as a tough soldier chick, still HOT. Then there were lots of side characters, all of whom were good and added to the movie somewhat. The movie had a good amount of humor in it too, and it was blended perfectly with the story and pacing. I even laughed out loud during some moments. The CGI is pretty good. There were some really beautiful shots of chaos and destruction during the battle, good cinematography. The soundtrack could have been better though, not saying it was lame or anything but there wasn't any really memorable tracks in it. Overall, a great sci-fi summer blockbuster, a really entertaining ride, a must watch.8.5/10",8,1,4,13 September 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Just give Leo his damn Oscar already.
","Martin Scorsese is like the master of films like these. I love to see films where an empire is built from scratch, you get to see its workings etc etc and then there is the downfall. First let me just say that just give Leonardo DiCaprio his damn Oscar already, he was amazing in this film. The writing in this film is great and with Leo's performance, it was a sight to see. Loved the moments of his speeches especially. The way he had with words was awesome. The acting was great by other actors too, most notable Jonah Hill. The movie is about a guy who goes in stock business, has a silver tongue and builds an empire from it. The way he works, was not normal granted but it worked. It is three hours long but has great pacing and keeps you interested throughout that you won't even feel that three hours have past when the movie is done. There are no slowdowns. The one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was lack of likable characters, apart from the protagonist, I don't think there were any characters I really cared for even though many got a lot of screen time. Also, ending to these type of Scorsese films were never to my liking. :pSide note: The movie is NOT for young audiences. Lots of profanity, gratuitous nudity and other stuff. Overall a great film and will definitely get an Oscar nod. Must watch. 8.5/10",8,0,4,20 January 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," 60% percent of the time it works every time.
","'60% percent of the time it works every time'. Kinda sums up the humor in the movie for me. The movie is a like a spoof of old T.V news companies. Will Ferrel and his team of misfits news guys are a funny bunch. Most of the time their overacting pays out and can make you laugh although it does get lame from time to time. Lots of one liners in the movie, many are pretty good. Then there are other characters and cameos here and there that are pretty cool. Jack Black, Ben stiller, that dude from Shawshank etc. The lovey dovey stuff was lame BUT the fight between them was surprisingly good and funny. Best part of the movie was no doubt the infamous hilariously brutal fight between different news channel teams. MAN that scene alone is worth it to watch the movie, it was just so ridiculous and awesome. (y)Overall, it is a good comedy movie with some quirks here and there. 7/10",7,0,0,9 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Not without its flaws but still serves as a great sendoff to the middle earth saga.
","So here we are, the last we'll see of middle earth on the big screen. Being a major fan of LOTR trilogy and having liked the previous two Hobbit films, the feels of goodbye was indeed high when watching this film, not to mention there were some really emotional scenes in the movie.It picks up exactly where the last film left off, with Smaug flying to Laketown. I gotta say, it was one hell of an opening sequence. Then the story boils down to a slow paced conflict with the impending battle owing to the film's name slowly coming closer. Almost all of the second half of the film involves the battle and events in it. The movie had some really spectacular scenes, my favorite being rescue of Gandalf. That scene was filled with awesomeness. Performances from the main characters were yet again great while many of the rest were a mixed bag. Martin Freeman(Bilbo) and Richard Armitage (Thorin) really carried the film emotionally with their great performance. All was not well I'm afraid, the stretching of the source material is yet again glaringly apparent just like the last part. Lots of filler content, which, for the most part, just hampers the pacing and isn't interesting enough. The pointless love triangle was again pointless and dragged on. The 2 hour and 20 min runtime could have been shaved a lot to remove such extra stuff, I don't know why Peter Jackson insists these movies should be long when the source material itself is limited unlike LOTR. Also, the overuse of CGI again was an issue. It is not that the CGI itself was bad as some stuff looked great, it is that they didn't used it well, like they lazily implemented it all. You can't expect to throw everything at the screen and expect it to look good. Lots of areas had fakey feeling and you could tell that green screen was used etc. This issue has been persistent in this trilogy. The battle of the five armies was a long ass sequence but even with all the new tech and story material at hand (Five armies, DAMN), it didn't had THE FEEL of battles from LOTR, especially since the accompanying soundtrack is nowhere near as good. The claim that it will be the biggest and best battle done yet by the creators clearly falls short. Despite its many shortcomings, it was an entertaining ride with some great scenes and serves as a sendoff to this middle earth saga. The tie-ins with LOTR were great. Now, I can watch all of them in sequence, Hobbit trilogy first, then LOTR. A MEGA MIDDLE EARTH MARATHON.8/10",8,3,7,27 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A piece of art.
","'A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.'Birdman is a film about a washed up actor, who was once famous for starring as Birdman (Superhero), and his battle with himself and those around him during the final days of his Broadway play premiere. This film boasts an immense ensemble of talent, and you definitely get the result. Micheal Keaton, Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis and some others all deliver amazing performances. It is truly a feat to see everyone just acting their best.And at the center of it all is Micheal Keaton and his career's best performance. He was awesome. Period. Because of awesome performances, every scene was a joy to behold, the dialogue delivery was great, the dialogue itself was great. Another thing I really enjoyed about this film was that how its story paralleled with Micheal Keaton's and Edward Norton's real life. Micheal Keaton is most known for his role in Tim Burton's classic Batman film and its sequel and his character in the film has a similar scenario. Edward Norton is quite famously known for being difficult to work with on set and his character in the film is definitely like it too. Gives a nice meta feel to the film. The greatest achievement of the film though is its cinematography. I was completely floored by it. The whole movie feels like a single long take. Technically, it consists of a couple of extra long takes joined together by great editing to make it seem like a one take. Either way, I have never seen longer takes then in this movie. And it just feels really raw and realistic, like you're actually there. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to deliver long dialogues without cuts. Makes you appreciate the acting even more. Kudos to the cinematography team. With everything so top notch in this film, the story itself felt like the weakest part to me. I'm not saying it was bad or anything, but it just didn't felt fulfilling. Maybe they had to sacrifice the story for the shooting style, felt like that to me. When you have everything else great, something not near their level sticks out like a sore thumb. Regardless, it was a great movie overall, definitely a sight to behold. A piece of art if you will. All the Oscar nominations are well deserved and I have feeling it will bag a lot of them too. 8.7/10",8,1,7,12 February 2015
The Big Short," Definitely over-hyped but still worth a watch.
","The Big Short is a movie based on a true story about a look at a couple of groups who foresaw the economic crash of 2008 and cashed in against greedy banks etc. The performances were rock solid. The cast did a great job. Most notable was Christain Bale, who played this genius yet socially awkward guy, and Steve Carrel, who yet again proved that he can do more than just comedy roles. Now the subject which was being covered isn't something that an average person will find interesting. Economics, banking and related stuff with tons of terminologies and jargons and numbers. It could get pretty boring fast. So the movie incorporated various ways to make it all interesting like a fun script that kept things light and quirky, various 4th wall breaking moments, celebrity cameos explaining important terms etc. It all combined together to form an uneven but ultimately an enjoyable experience. The pacing was often uneven. I was bored in some parts of the film. And the hand holding got a bit too in-your-face at times. I get that they were trying to make things easier for mass audiences but some of the ways incorporated distracted rather than being fun. Also, the movie tried to make this feel more documentary-ish and it ended up being annoying at times, especially the shaky camera work. The recession of 2008 was a BIG EVENT that effected the whole world and knowing more about it is always something I found interesting. Definitely a good watch, but I do feel it is being overblown in the award season. Kinda feels like this year's American Hustle.7/10",7,2,5,27 January 2016
Mother!," Weird but Interesting Experience.
","Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, Mother is a movie about... well... a shit-ton of things depending on how you see it. It's an allegorical movie filled to the brim with symbolism and I'm glad I didn't have a clue what this movie was about.There is a lot to appreciate about the movie. I loved the cinematography, the claustrophobic framing flowed properly with the movie, giving you the feeling of being trapped and anxiety as you follow Jennifer Lawrance through it all, very sparingly giving you a wide shot so you can breathe. There are long sequences in the movie which are relentless and chaotic, brutal and insane, taking you for a ride you definitely did not expect. There's a lack of music but it was in favor of the experience. Proper use of surround channels and good sound design aided in immersing you in this weird trip.Performances are pretty much great across the board from the main characters. Jennifer Lawrance and Javier Bardem both were amazing. Supporting characters like Ed Harris and Michelle Pfieffer delivered their stuff properly.Now, I can't get into the story since I don't wanna give anything away but it's interesting, to say the least. Sure the way it's all executed might seem pretentious and too much of an artsy film where Aronofsky's head was probably stuck up his ass trying to make this BUT if you give the movie a chance, it can be one hell of a weird experience. I was hooked in trying to figure out WTF is going on, and while my brain went somewhere else, I had an interesting time with the movie. When I learned what was actually going on, a lot of things just clicked naturally.If Aronofsky's 'Noah' was taking things too far (as I recall a lot of people were butthurt over it, I enjoyed the movie), this is on a whole another level. I honestly loved the experience. It was sometimes too slow and I'm still trying to figure out all of the things and not all of the symbolism was good or perfect or genius or whatever. But with Aronofsky's brilliant direction, I would definitely recommend this if you wanna watch something different, something that will stay with your mind for a while after finishing it, something you might wanna watch again in order to get everything.And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10. Weird, but Interesting.",8,2,3,23 October 2018
Thor: The Dark World," A highly entertaining ride.
","Another hit by Marvel and with Captain America: The Winter Soldier looking awesome so far, Marvel The Avengers Phase two is looking pretty good. This was an improvement from Thor 1 in almost every way. The story was your typical Superhero story but it was executed properly which made for a great viewing. The Marvel humor is also present thoroughly in this movie. They timed it rightly and it even made me laugh out loud during some moments. There were also nods to the Avengers universe here and there, which makes these movies all the more fun as it is all connected and what not. Marvel has certainly hit a Jackpot ever since they decided to do this from 2008.Almost all the cast from Thor 1 was back, which was good too see. Chris Hemsworth delivered a great performance as Thor yet again. His character development is good and you can see how much he has changed since Thor 1. BUT I'll have to say, the star of the show is LOKI. He just nails it every time he is on screen. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is probably one of the best casting decision ever. He is one of my favourite character of this Marvel Avengers universe. And the WTF/Awesome ending of this movie just made the wait to see him again a lot harder. The side characters are good too, whether it is for comic relief or other stuff. Mainly Darcy, she is funny and its good they kept her. The action sequences were really good and very entertaining. The CGI was nice and much improved from Thor 1. There was a lot more action too this time, and rightly paced too, which made the movie an entertaining experience through and through. As it is common with Marvel movies, be sure to check out the two after credits scene. I can't wait for Captain America: The winter soldier now. Must watch for any fan of the Marvel movies. 8.2/10",8,0,1,10 February 2014
Lucy," Flawed yet enjoyable.
","'We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale.'The movie explores the famous theory about how we only use 10% of our brain. Our protagonist, with the help of a new drug, manages to use a lot more than that. Scarlet Johanson did a pretty good job as the lead, going from a normal women to an extremely smart and powerful being. And you had to have a wise guy to give exposition about the concept of the movie and who better to have than Morgan Freeman. He was, as always, great. Now the movie had some really cool concepts and ideas, and some REALLY good scenes. But you have to be willing to apply a lot of suspension of disbelief because there is some really unbelievable stuff in this movie. If you go on wondering about the logic of it all, you'll ruin it. The not so good execution of certain elements stopped it from reaching greatness. First of all, the whole Mafia stuff was extremely pointless after Lucy got her powers. They should have focused on her powers and similar plot elements instead. What makes it more annoying is the fact that movie was really short, about 1 hour and 20 mins in duration only. A longer duration with more emphasis on her powers, development etc would have made it a lot better, instead they montaged her powers in the end. Then, like I mentioned earlier, the plot is really unbelievable. Even if you suspend lot of disbelief, you'll still be like WTF in many scenes. The CGI was okay-ish. Some scenes looked good while some clearly looked fake. Don't blaming it much though considering it only had 40 million $ budget. IN a way, this movie was somewhat like Transcendence, great albeit not a new concept and stuff but not so good execution. Good thing for this movie though was that it was still entertaining despite its many flaws. You'll definitely have a good time with it and might even wonder about philosophies and ideas depicted in the film. 7.3/10",7,0,6,4 October 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great start to a new trilogy of Star Wars.
","AH, STAR WARS IS BACK!! Since I was very young when the prequels came out and wasn't even born during the original trilogy, this was my first Star Wars movie in a cinema. And it was an enthralling experience. J.J Abrams, being a huge fan of the original star wars (A new hope), masterfully created an adventurous, thrilling, heart-pounding and all out entertaining start to a new trilogy while keeping things intact that made the original trilogy so dear to millions of fans. The dude is a Geek God, successfully helming back two of the biggest Sci-fi franchises, this and Star Trek. Old faces return and provide tons of nostalgia bombs and great moments. Harrison Ford, especially, was really great yet again as Han Solo. And all the while we are introduced to new characters as well, who were really well handled. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, who play Rey and Fin (The new leads), did a terrific job. You could see they gave it all in their roles and it really payed off. I loved them. They had great chemistry and were characters that you actually cared about. The new villain, Kylo Ren, was not just some evil baddie for the sake of being evil. I loved how the film humanized him while still making him feel like a force to be reckoned with. The movie looked beautiful. Great cinematography, combining on locations shots with top level CGI. The action scenes were really entertaining and well crafted. The movie had a typical J.J Abrams' breakneck pacing. There was never a dull moment. Everything was always on the move. Also, the movie had some pretty fine tuned humor. It was not overused or mistimed or stupid. I always love it when movies manage to pull out humor like this and it makes things all the more enjoyable. Great sound design too. The blasters, lightsabers, tie fighters etc all sounded amazing. Now there were some issues with the movie. For me, the soundtrack was just not really memorable. I'm not saying it was bad, it was in fact fine on normal terms and moment with old tracks were great but there weren't any new tracks that stood out and I was kinda bummed out by that. Also, it seemed like Disney and Abrams tried to play it so safe with this film that the story beats felt extremely similar at times. And while I can understand their reasons, it would have been great to have a bit more variety. As this has been a rousing success, I hope they take more risks and move onto new stuff in the next parts. All in all, I can't really tell you how happy I was when the movie finished because not only was it a DAMN fine entertaining film but also this will be a new Star Wars trilogy that I can actually be a part of as it releases over the years and I can't wait to see how the story moves forward. Need to re-watch it a couple of times more but it is probably near the top in the saga for me. Favourite film of the year so far. 9/10",9,4,36,26 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Now this is how you do a sequel.
","Now this is how to do a sequel. It is better than the previous part in every way. Better story, better pacing, better acting, better action and way better Hunger games itself. I was very underwhelmed by the game in the first one, it actually bored me somewhat. The game in this one on the other hand was intense and enjoyable. Story picks up from where it left off from the previous part. I loved the whole revolution vibe and its starting. There were more politics this time around and made the movie more interesting. Side characters in the movie were better, lots of new ones. Elizabeth Banks this time had a little more role and I really liked her, great acting by her in all that weird dressup. I still can't get behind the fact that rich high society folks in this series wear such GAY and weird and lame clothes. CGI was decent, an improvement from the previous part. The whole Hunger game, about 40-45 mins of it was shot in IMAX and it was beautiful to look at in HD quality. Gotta say, IMAX scenes always stand out in HD print. Same was the case with The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and TRON Legacy. Action scenes were enjoyably and tense sometimes. The pacing was MUCH better.I can't wait to see where the story goes, really wanna see the revolution and stuff. Overall a great sequel.8/10",8,4,21,22 January 2014
Godzilla," Best cinematic experience of my life in terms of EPICNESS.
","I was very young when I watched Godzilla (1998) and love it back then. In fact, it was one of my favourite movie of that time. Sure, I watched it again recently and it was no where near as good as it was in my memory but that didn't change my love for Godzilla. 16 years later, they released this movie and I was unbelievably HYPED UP for it. I had to wait 8-9 days since it's release to watch and during that time, I saw a lot of hate towards it. Lots of negative reviews, with most of them focusing on about Godzilla's way too less screen time, movie being boring and not many fights. IT got me worried. And to top it off, I watched it after X-men Days of future past, which was an excellent movie. But thankfully, GODZILLA DELIVERED!!The story wasn't anything outstanding, but it was good enough in my opinion and served well for the movie. It has some undertones like Nature restoring order, Man vs Nature etc which I liked. The movie has a more serious tone overall, no lame ass humor thankfully. It is also a slow burner, not your typical big budget block buster movie. And if you go in hoping for a Godzilla vs Monster mash or lots of fighting, destruction in a fast paced way like Pacific Rim or Transformers type movies, you will surely be disappointed. It is more akin to old classic monster movies, with lots of teasing and build up. And Gareth Edwards (The Director) delivered on that front masterfully. Sure, the movie feels slow during the first 20-30 mins and you don't really see THE BIG G for about an hour into the movie but the slow build up was DEFINITELY WORTH IT. I can't really describe how awesome it felt when Godzilla finally surfaced and we slowly get to see him in all his GLORY. My heart rate was unbelievably high. SO MUCH EPICNESS. This movie easily redefines the word EPIC. And that is thanks to the amazing camera work/cinematography and directing. Many of the shots are through POV and you get to really feel the huge scale. It was majestic. It was like the director just wanted you to soak in all the Epicness and scale of the moment. Soundtrack drops, eerie silence and all you can see is Godzilla or the other monsters and hear the rumbling of their presence. The amount of truly epic scenes in this movie is seriously too damn high. Sure, many of them don't involve Godzilla vs other monsters but I didn't care. Monster vs Monster action really doesn't get going until the finale as they tease it throughout the movie, but BOY what an amazing finale it was. UFFFF it was OOOZING with EPICNESS. People actually clapped and cheered during some scenes, which I haven't witnessed in quite some time now. The other creatures, M.U.T.Os (Massive unidentified terrestrial organism), weren't pushovers. They gave Big G one hell of a tough time. The CGI was amazing. The destruction, the MUTOs and Godzilla all looked great. Loved Godzilla's design. He is HUGE (not FAT) and mean looking. The MUTOs are creepy good. They gave them emotions too which was a great touch.Soundtrack was surprisingly refreshing. It felt like those old monster movies soundtrack which I actually don't really like. But somehow it really worked with the scenes in this movie. Also, that creepy chant or whatever soundtrack from 2001: A space odyssey was also used in the movie during some truly epic scenes and it made them EVEN MORE EPIC.This movie is not without flaws though. The human characters either weren't really interesting or the movie was so EPIC that it made them insignificant. :p Well aside from Bryan Cranston that is, who I thought was great. BUT he got very little screen time, which was a huge letdown. The scientist, military general, the family, all the clichéd characters that you see in such monster or destruction type movies were all present. There were some cheesy/cliché scenes too which you get with such movies. Overall, I would say that it is without a doubt THE BEST CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE in terms of EPICNESS. I have never been so BLOW AWAY during some scenes like I was in this movie. I really don't get majority of the hate. Even with its flaws, the EPICNESS far far outweighs it. And if there ever was a movie that was meant to be seen in a cinema, this would be it.8.8/10",8,6,11,25 May 2014
Deadpool," What a Blast! Most fun I've had with a Superhero film so far.
","This is a superhero origin movie about Deadpool, who's more of an anti-hero. With all the great marketing and dedication by Ryan Reynolds and the team behind it, the movie had garnered immense hype and it was really pleasing to see the movie live up to it. Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. He personified Deadpool perfectly. He was simply amazing. Loved him. Aside from him, the secondary cast did a really good job as well. I loved Morena Baccarin as the love interest for Deadpool and very surprisingly, their romance subplot was handled very well, something that is very rare, especially considering I usually hate lovey dovey stuff. They had great chemistry and I would say they are probably the best superhero couple in my opinion after Spiderman and Gwen in The Amazing spiderman movies. T.J Miller as Deadpool's friend was great and had some really funny lines. Loved Colossus and the other teenage mutant, movie handled them very well. Hell, even the Indian cab driver guy was funny and good in his small role. From the awesome opening credits to the funny after credits scene, Deadpool was a blast. It was very tightly packed with little to no breathing room at all. The movie really flowed with jokes, action, romance etc, all interwoven very nicely. The movie was small in scale and I think it was a good thing. They focused on all the right points, mainly Deadpool, and it paid off. It had Deadpool's signature 4th wall breaks and humor and was perfectly crafted in the film. So many utterly hilarious moments in the film where I actually laughed out loud. I tell ya, I was having so much fun with this film that during half time, I could have sworn that only 15-20 mins have passed by. Seriously, the movie flew by me so fast, it was almost weird. It is almost 2 hours long and it felt like half that long. The movie is rated R, and it fully utilizes it. There is tons and tons of crude jokes and curses, Deadpool s*** talks here and there all the time. The action is bloody and gory. There is nudity and sex. I mean this is a Rated R movie through and through and it was just really refreshing to see a superhero movie like this. Plus, you can't do Deadpool justice in any other way. Relative to other superhero movies, Deadpool had a small budget, and it sometimes showed. CGI was a bit shoddy at times but the way they incorporated it in scenes and didn't made it a CGI fest, it looked mostly fine. The action scenes were great and entertaining. Villain was a bummer though. Ajax a.k.a Francis was just like the opening credits defined him, just some British villain guy. He was uninteresting, had little to no development and was evil for the sake of being evil. But funnily enough, he still worked for the movie cause all it really needed was a target for Deadpool and Ajax fitted that bill perfectly. So it's more of like a nitpick then a real negative but still I would have liked it if the villain was more fleshed out. All in all, this is easily the funniest superhero movie I have watched to date, beating Guardians of the Galaxy, and was also my funnest cinema experience so far. It's one of those rare movies that is made by fans for the fans but also caters to non-fans. I myself didn't know much about Deadpool but I still enjoyed the hell out of this film. It is great to see this film being successful cause now Fox, and hopefully other studios too, will take more chances and give the teams more freedom. I guess Fox redeemed themselves after that disaster of a film, Fant4stic. A must watch. 9/10",8,3,12,20 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Classy, exciting and just outright entertaining.
","'Manners Maketh Man.' This is one of those movies that completely takes you by surprise. I enjoyed it immensely. James Bond type-ish British spy film, but with way WAY more wack and awesomeness. Matthew Vaughn is a great director. I've watched all of his films (except Layer Cake) and the guy just has a knack of delivering really enjoyable/entertaining movies (Stardust, Xmen - First class, Kick ass). The cast delivered great performances all round. Colin Firth simply KICKED ASS. Loved his character and how classy yet deadly he was. Taron Egerton, the protagonist, was some nobody to me before I saw this movie. Now, he is a star in the making. Samuel L.Jackson, while didn't stole the show or anything, was a pretty good villain with a funny lisp condition.The plot actually felt somewhat fresh and wasn't your typical 'Take over the world' type scenarios that you see in this genre. Although I have see the main mechanism elsewhere, the reasons for doing, the justification and all that was something that I could standby with. Also, the movie had some messages about over reliance on smartphones, privacy hacks etc which I really liked.Coming to the action, let me just say that it was just awesome. The pacing was so well done that many scenes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart thumping like crazy. The hand to hand scenes were also well executed. Full of gore, long takes, class and no excessive shaky cam and fast cuts bullshit. Add dark humor layer to it all and it was just a wonder to watch it all. The Church scene in particular really WOWED me. Sound effects and OSTs were also perfectly edited in scenes, enhancing the experience, adding more adrenaline, class, humor etc as required. The only complaint I had was that the movie tried to develop some romance and while I'm REALLY glad it didn't linger on it, it did kinda felt out of place and just tacked on. Overall, it's the best movie of this year so far for me. I just hate myself for not seeing it in the cinema. 8.6/10",8,3,8,25 May 2015
Spectre," A disappointment.
","Spectre is the last entry of Daniel Craig as James Bond and it is about him trying to uncover the secret organization Spectre, teased in the previous films, all the while their MI6 division is on the brink of being decommissioned. Now I've never been a HUGE bond fan or anything like that. I always kinda enjoyed them but never too much until the Craig Bond movies. His movies were just different and more suited for my style of liking and I became fan. Naturally, I was super excited to see how they end it up and unfortunately, they went out in a whimper instead of a bang. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty good in the movie. Daniel Craig again was great as James Bond, although looking a bit old now, which makes it good that this is his last film as Bond. Other MI6 operatives who resume their roles from Skyfall like Ralph Fiennes as the new M, Ben Wishaw as Q etc were pretty good and gave a team feel to the film. Lea Seydoux definitely looked the part for a bond girl, and she was mostly alright in her role. Sam Mendes again showed that he can direct a beautiful looking film. Skyfall looked awesome and this looks even better. Amazing cinematography, tons of wide shots and fewer cuts and all that goodness. The action scenes were really beautifully shot. I mean this movie is gorgeous to look at times, especially in scenes like when we first meet the villain, so pretty.On the bad side, the movie had some big issues. The story and its flow wasn't handled too well, especially considering another movie released last year had almost the same plot and it did it in a far more better way, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. Because of this, the pacing felt like a mixed bag. Good looking action sequences sprinkled over story development scenes which just weren't interesting enough and gave the movie this feeling that it lacked energy. Not to mention the stupid romance subplot which was so rushed and happens so quickly, you're like 'Seriously?'. And lastly, my biggest issue with the movie, the villain. They had f***ing Christoph Waltz, amazing actor who could have played a perfect bond villain but instead they handled him really poorly. He's hardly in the movie and when he is on screen, he doesn't emit the kind of presence the movie wants him to. Felt like such a waste. Was really disappointed by this aspect. All in all, Spectre felt more like a disappointment overall cause I was expecting more considering it was the last part, everything was building upto this and Sam Mendes was again directing since Skyfall was awesome, Or for the fact that this is the first time Judi Dench is not playing as M, just doesn't feel the same without her. The movie has some redeeming qualities which keeps it from falling into total mediocrity, and which is why I still enjoyed it to some extent. If you're a bond fan or especially Craig bond fan, then this is a surely worth a try, just keep your hopes down. 6.8/10",6,1,3,20 March 2016
Her," A unique romantic film with a touch of Sci-fi.
","The best romantic/love story type movie I have ever seen and it's funny that the romance is not even between two people. Sci-fi love story you can say. The movie is set in a not so distant future. Artificial intelligence Operating systems are introduced which evolve by learning and interaction. I thought about how the world would be like if it actually happened long after the movie was finished. I just loved the premise/concept of this movie, so amazing. Joaquin Phoenix plays the protagonist who is going through a divorce with his wife. He gets this new A.I OS and fells in love with it. His acting was AMAZING, another Oscar contender. He was just so likable. The OS, Samantha, is voiced by Scarlett Johansson and she was also AMAZING. You really get to like and care for Samantha too and that is an amazing task considering you can only hear her. The way their relationship evolves was beautiful. There were some side characters which were good, mainly Amy Adams. I like her nerdy programmer character and look.The movie was very well directed and paced. Had great soundtrack and cinematography. Definitely one of the best movie of last year. A MUST WATCH. 8.7/10",8,1,3,14 January 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," How can it not be a LOVELY DAY when you watch something like this.
","'Oh what a day.....what a lovely day!'. Definitely was a lovely day, and how can it not be when you watch something like this. Prior to watching this, I did a marathon of the original trilogy and didn't liked them very much. They may have been great in their own time but not anymore. No idea why people loved them. And I was of the opinion that this movie won't be that different from them. Luckily, I was wrong, so very wrong. The movie takes place in a post apocalyptic world where nuclear war destroyed everything. Chaos and pure madness is what remains. Now, in the previous movies, this whole post apocalyptic world didn't really interest me all that much. But in Fury Road, I got just the type of execution that clicked with me and the world hooked me in. Story was never the selling point of these movies anyway. Tom Hardy filled in the shoes of Mel Gibson as Mad Max. He played his one of the more typical roles, with less talk and tough guy voice and such, and he was great. Max needed no big introduction or anything and we didn't get one either. However, The character who stole the show was Furiosa, played perfectly by Charlize Theron. She was amazing. Being both tough/badass and emotional/caring. Her character was the center point of the movie and it felt like she is the lead, not Max. The movie could have easily been called 'Mad Furiosa: Fury Road'. The character development of some characters was pretty good, and all of it was done on the run. The whole movie is like this one big chase of epic proportions. The action sequences were so satisfying and thrilling. The cinematography was so perfect. The editing and pacing was spot on. Many heart racing and adrenaline injecting sequences. I was in awe multiple times throughout the movie due to the sheer beauty of carnage and destruction at display. What made it even more awesome was that 80% of the action was all practical effects. I mean, WOW, just WOW. Kudos to George Miller and the team.The movie utilized very vibrant and popping color filters, making every frame, all the destruction and madness more beautiful. The explosions never looked more awesome. And it was a very fresh sight to see too because almost all post apocalyptic movies have bleak degraded colors for dark tone and atmosphere. The one thing I was most glad about was the Soundtrack. I hated the original trilogy soundtrack. IT was miscued a lot, and was just bad. I'm glad George Miller went with a more modern approach and the resulting soundtrack was great. And Epic. Really made all the action more thrilling. As for the negatives, one thing that really popped out was that while CGI was sparingly used, and most of it was great, there were some moments where green screen usage was apparent and it REALLY felt out of place because everything else was so top notch. Another thing that somewhat bothered me was the motion direction style that George Miller sometimes adds into his sequences, which makes them feel sped up and jittery. All in all, this was one HELL of an action movie. It has been a long time since I got this much entertainment from a purely action movie. Don't go into it thinking it has a deep plot and story and whatnot. It is not that type of movie. But it is still a must watch because honestly speaking, it is a work of art for what it was going for. 8.5/10",8,1,10,29 June 2015
Warcraft," Entertaining, albeit a bit messy, watch
","Warcraft is a video game adaptation of the popular game series of the same name. In order to escape their dying world, the orcs invade the world of Azeroth, while the inhabitants of that world, namely the humans, try to stop their efforts. Now I have never played World of Warcraft or any other game in the franchise except for Warcraft 3, and that too only online matches with my friends, meaning I have little to no knowledge about this universe, its lore, its characters etc. Having said that, I was still interested in watching this movie as I just love fantasy worlds and this looked like another good one. From the very first scene to the very last, this movie was RUSHED AS HELL. There was literally no breathing room, none at all. This is the core reason for all of my problems with the movie. It felt like they had the material to make two movies, or even a trilogy, but crammed it all into one 2 hour long movie. The movie just went from scene to scene, locations to location, without giving you time to take it all in. This also resulted in little to no development for majority of the characters. There was also a super rushed forced romance in the movie. And the movie just ends. No proper resolution. Seriously, it feels like they just butchered a 3 hour movie to make it shorter. I hope there is an extended Bluray version or something. Keeping the extremely fast pace in mind, the movie was somehow still entertaining. I wanted to know more about the world, the characters, the races and what have you. The story was straightforward with some interesting characters. Surprisingly, the main Orc, Duratan, was the one who had the most depth and emotion in the entire movie. This was not only thanks to a good performance, but also thanks to some amazing motion capture work. The facial animations and detail was almost on Dawn of the planet of the apes level, which really brought not only Duratan, but other orcs to life, whether it be Guldan: the big baddie or Duratan's wife. This brings me to the overall CGI work. The orcs, as stated above, looked amazing. Huge, fierce, powerful beings. Their fights had impact and you really got the feeling that humans were puny little things in front of them. The locations looked great as well. The different landscapes and cities were quite beautiful at times. However, CGI was inconsistent. The creatures/animals didn't look as good, and at times, when there were both live humans and CGI orcs and environments in the mix, things did get too green-screen-ey. The action was good and entertaining. It wasn't anything outstanding, something I was expecting for some reason ( :p ), but it was good enough that you get thrill out of it. I wish there were more Orc vs Orc brawls cause that looked AWESOME!! The magic stuff was great. The effects, the power and feel, it really made magic a force to fear, and I loved it. Soundtrack was good enough with some really good tracks on the orcs side. Coming back to the characters, while Duratan was great, most of the humans were really hard to care for. This again can be attributed to the fact none of them got any proper time for development. BUT, some of the acting was bad too. Stilted and lifeless. And with movie being so rushed, sometimes characters just pop out, even near the end for furthering the plot, making things more messy.Still, surprisingly enough, it was an entertaining watch, even if a messy one. The 2 hours flew by. If it wasn't such a rushed job, this could have been a great fantasy action movie and the general audience would have liked it more. As for the fans, I get why they like it more as if you know the ton of lore already, the rushed job won't have a big effect. My recommendation is that it is worth a try if you like fantasy worlds. There are things to appreciate in the movie and can be a good time for many. Seeing the box office, I don't think we'll get a sequel but I really hope they do make one. I wanna see more of this world. 7/10",7,1,3,6 August 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," One of Will Smith's finest.
","'Happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. 'The movie is about a family struggling through poverty and how the father tries to change it. The whole movie is just filled with struggle to achieve happiness, hence the name. And the struggle sure has its TOUGH moments. Since the movie portrays this in a great way, those moments really does make you GO ALL FEELSY. Will Smith was great in this. Movies like these tell you that he sure can do amazing acting, something other than his usual tough guy gangsta routine. There were scenes in this movie where you can't but admire the man's acting. And because of that, you REALLY do feel for the guy in the movie. His son, Jaden Smith, was pretty good in the film too. The soundtrack was pretty pleasing. While the movie was mostly covered with sadness, the soundtrack was often playful.This movie really does make you appreciate what you have and by the time it is finished, you will surely feel an immense warm happy feeling inside. I love it when movies are able to make you feel that. How in the hell did this duo went from THIS to that ABOMINATION After Earth is beyond me. 8/10",8,0,0,16 June 2014
13 Hours," Micheal Bay restricting himself to deliver a straight forward, focused movie. A Thrilling and Entertaining watch.
","This movie is based on a true story about the attack on an American embassy and a secret CIA base in Benghazi, Libya, on the 9/11 anniversary in 2012. And how a few numbers of of Ex-Soldiers managed to repel the attack. Directed by Micheal Bay, I was surprised to see him holding back his Bay-ism and deliver a straight forward focused film. The story got a long build up at the start, setting up the location, the characters and the situation. And then chaos. What I liked most about this film was the fact that you felt just as lost as the soldiers and people in this movie. The confusion, the chaos, the uncertainty, it was delivered quite nicely, creating tension and thrill. There are a lot of characters in the movie, but ultimately it is focused on these soldiers, and while the movie could have done a better job developing them, what it did was good enough in a sense that it worked for the movie. I liked em. Acting varied, with some delivering pretty good performances. Also, again with Micheal Bay restricting himself, there were no stupid side plots or cringe worthy romance for any of the characters. They all had families back home and we got some moments with them, humanizing the soldiers more. The action was solid. It felt raw and realistic. There were the occasional Micheal Bay's firework explosions and some exaggerated RPG moments, but that's about it. Everything else was great. And this is the movie to watch on a home theater if you own one because sound effects were terrific. The explosions, the guns firing, the bullet impacts, it all sounded really great. Soundtrack was good. And the cinematography was great, it was a good looking movie. The movie strayed away from political stuff, and just focused on the incident, which made me appreciate it more. The underlying message it was trying to give might have been too heavy handed at times, especially at the end, but it was a good one. My issues with the movie, other than the ones already mentioned, were that the movie was too long. It took about 40 mins for things to get started and while the build up created the anticipation for what's about to happen, it got too long and slow in some areas. 20 mins shorter and it would have been a much tighter and cleaner film. Also, there are some, few, but some cringe-y scenes attempting to add humor, which stand out like a sore thumb considering most of the movie has a serious tone. All in all, it was an entertaining watch and shows Micheal Bay still can control himself. I hope the dude gives up on Transformers and does other things, like this, more. Shame that this turned out to be his least grossing film. Definitely a recommended watch. 7.8/10",7,19,28,13 August 2016
Furious 7," One last ride.
","'One last ride.'So finally watched the 7th installment in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Its amazing how this franchise has increased its popularity and success, be this long, and not be based on a book or something. Directed by James Wan, who previously was known only for famous horror flicks like The Conjuring and Insidious, did a great job delivering a full on high budget action film and a great send off to Paul Walker, gotta give him kudos for this. The passing of Paul Walker had an overall presence throughout the movie. And it only got more potent as the movie went on. This is the last film of his, and the movie gave him an amazing send off. The tribute at the end was truly beautiful. In fact, this marks the first time that I was brought to tears in a cinema. I did a full re-watch of all the previous parts prior to watching this, so everything was fresh in my mind and while watching the tribute, I Just couldn't hold it anymore. Knowing that this will be the last we ever see of Brian/Paul Walker, it just got to me. THE FEELS WERE JUST TOO MUCH!!The film takes right after Fast and Furious 6 and finally ties in to events in Tokyo Drift and moves on from there. The main antagonist this time is older and more badass brother of the villain from previous part, played by Jason Statham. He was a great addition in my opinion, brought in proper badassness to the villain side. The rekindling of Dom and Letty continues in this part, and the team now gets together to find a way to hunt down the new baddie, which came in terms of a computer/hacking plot point, which was neither bad nor good, but it worked for the movie. Story and flow of the movie felt disjointed. It felt like many of the scenes were just put in sequence without much thought given into how they'll fit and flow. I guess a much of this had to do with the passing of Paul Walker and they had to re-write the script and stuff. The movie retained the essence of the previous parts, especially the last two. Stuff like a lot of cheesy scenes, dialogues, action film clichés etc, but hey, that's a part of this franchise, so it's all good. Humour again was focused mostly on Tyrese Gibson, and it really did made me chuckle and even laugh a few times, even if it was stupid mostly. Now, the action in this film is awesome. This is genuinely a great action film all round and the thing that made it really EPIC was that there wasn't just one kind of action in it. It had car/vehicle warfare, shootouts, hand to hand combats all mixed in nicely. And if you thought that previous parts were over the top, you ain't seen nothing yet. This movie takes ridiculous action sequences to a whole new level. Plenty of amazing sequences that will surely be a talk of action film fans for years to come. Most of the CGI was great. Lots of awesome stunts and stuff. The movie also did a great job of using body doubles, CGI etc to fill in the scenes of Paul Walker as I didn't notice most of it. The soundtrack was good.Some stuff that I didn't like was that while the action was great, I do think they went a little too overboard this time. You can only suspense your disbelief to a certain level. Heroes were not only surviving, but almost walking away unscathed from impossible situations a little too often. Also, some of the characters almost felt like superheroes to be honest, it was that ridiculous at times. Another thing that I didn't like was The Rock only had a few scenes, he is easily the biggest addition to this franchise, figuratively and literally. And that letty and dom romance stuff got a bit too much screen time and became annoying. All in all, another great addition to the franchise, and since it is the 7th installment, it is only meant for the fans of the series. If you're a first timer, you better watch the previous parts first. Great action movie, great send off to Paul Walker. R.I.P8/10",8,0,2,14 April 2015
