Ghost," A Classic (Possible Spoilers)
","Ghost was a great movie. Even though it was made in the early 90's it will never get old, it's a classic. The plot is great, even though when I first saw it as a child, this movie seemed kind of scary. It is great overall.
There is however, one flaw in this movie I have noticed. During the 'pottery scene' Demi Moore's hands are dirty because she is making the vase, but when she reaches out to kiss Patrick Swazi, her hands are MAGICALLY CLEAN. Overall this movie was great and fun to watch.",Null,1,2,4 August 2003
Friday Night Lights," Very touching *spoilers*
","Well, what more can you say about a movie that was very good, while trying to maintain the realism a true story should have. Friday night lights was a very good film. Billy Bob Thorton showed us just how much versatility he has as his role as coach Gaines. This movie has something for everyone, I enjoyed the excitement and competition that came from watching a sport as well as the story line that went along with it. There were many moral lessons in the story as well, including the message of 'school work before sports'. Derek Luke convincingly played the role of a cocky high school sports all star, easily playing a role well below his age. This movie truly was enjoyable.",9,0,2,7 July 2005
The Lion King," No effort put into this movie... at all!
","This is another case of a quick money grab by feeding off of 90s nostalgia movies; something that has been a signature aspect of this decade. Of course, I saw the movie expecting it to be a money grab, but decided to give it a chance anyway, at the very least, it'll be entertaining, right?Haha, the movie was trash. The actors spoke in a monotone manner. They read the script like middle school drama students whose parents forced them to sign up for the class. The actors had no emotions in their voices, the delivery was also poor, certain lines you just... have to give a pause... wait a little bit so it hits right... nope, every line was read with the same generic pace. Iconic songs were ruined, and while I understand that it is okay to change some lines and take artistic liberties so that the movie isn't an exact carbon copy of its cartoon counterpart, there are some lines that should have been left as is, when you change some things it only makes it worse.Feel free to see the movie, but do not expect much, I warn you.",2,1,1,1 December 2019
