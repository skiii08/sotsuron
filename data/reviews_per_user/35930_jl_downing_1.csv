"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," not the best brit comedy but okay nevertheless
","i thought this would be a little better, i was a bit disappointed by this, i just think it could of been better, but don't get me wrong i thought this was okay, just thought it could of been up there with Hott Fuzz, but it falls just short, however i think it may be a bit unfare to comapre the two, so looking at the film by itself i think its okay it has a few moments that make you smile, the story isn't great a bit predictable though especially the ending, i thought it was good though i thought simon pegg was really good and probably elevated the movie a bit if im honest, especially during the training scenes, David schwimmer's direction was good i was pleased he didn't take a cameo in the film, for me that would of ruined it because it would of been too much of a gimmick for me, but for David schwimmers directorial career this film is a really good start, and i cant wait to see what he moves onto next, so yeah would deffo recommend this, very much worth a watch",5,0,2,23 September 2008
