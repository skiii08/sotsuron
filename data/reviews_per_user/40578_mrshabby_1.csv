The Blair Witch Project," Sadly hyped
","I was very excited to see this film after having heard excellent reviews and positive reactions from acquaintances who had seen it.  Perhaps i exposed myself to too much of the hype, but i was very disappointed.  i went expecting (and hoping for) a good scare, but found myself unable to buy into the film - unable to connect with what i was seeing on the screen.  i felt like i was watching someone's vacation videos... and some that i have seen have been more frightening than this movie.  the last 30 seconds of the film were the only few that were able to raise my pulse even a touch.  so, though i was excited for the premise, format, and the idea of, at last, a good horror flick, i found myself walking out the door wondering what else i could have spent my couple of bucks on... like a burger.  very disappointing.  it just wasn't scary.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
