It," Average and Disappointing
","I was expecting an engrossing story, what I got was ineffective jump scares and seemingly random scenes. The whole storyline is here and there, I did not care much for the characters and did not find the story at all easy to follow. I have given 4 stars as the acting and production quality are good, but the actual experience is an ordinary one. The original is MUCH better.",4,3,6,22 February 2018
Ant-Man," Nothing New
","No surprises and and almost no originality, otherwise it's OK.Each and every 'super hero' film is the same now. Villain wants to conquer the world but Americans come to the rescue. This is exactly that, along with the obligatory family/down on his luck/rescue formula.Some good action sequences but that is all that makes this 'different' from all of the other films in this genre. Good fun to watch but nothing original nor worthwhile.",6,0,1,24 July 2017
