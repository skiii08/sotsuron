Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas does it again!!
","I saw Star Wars at 12:15am May 19th. It was great!! to say the least.. The technical effects, the story line, the humor, the laser fight scenes, everything is what you would expect in a George Lucas film.  The crowd was really into it too. I think that added to the excitement of the movie. People were cheering when the old characters were introduced.  There is emotional scenes, laugher, and a lot of new characters.  I think that the young man who played Anikan 'Luke' Skywalker will probably be a future Leonardo Dicaprio.  I thought he was extremely talented and real.  The movie is everything that you would think Star Wars is all about..  I can't wait till Episode II, in 2002.  This is a Great Movie!!!!!!  You Gotta See it",10,1,1,19 May 1999
