Your Name.," A beautiful film with a band blasting their music into your ears.
","Probably due to how lame and unentertaining these types of movies are, I tend to avoid movies that involve body swaps like a plague. What Shinkai Makoto did here with the story really was impressive as he added a bit of a twist to it and making a very cohesive and entertaining story. Makoto has a very unique style from the other current Japanese animators by providing films that are absolutely beautiful to look at, such as the landscapes and sceneries. He mixed these beautiful scenes with a surprisingly interesting story by having two interesting characters and for us to see them experience what is going on as they constantly swap bodies back and forth. I liked how the movie doesn't focus on certain tropes and used the comedic moments effectively. You understand who they are and end up liking both of them by the end of the film. Also, the twist that I've mentioned earlier is surprising and introduces a stake for these characters to overcome. This is where the emotional part hits extremely well as you end up cheering for them and you hope that everything will work out with them in the end.The voice acting was surprisingly good, especially as the actors who voiced the main roles are not professionally trained voice actors. Both Kamiki Ryunosuka and Kamishiraishi Mone gave so much personality to their characters and were able to act emotional and funny when it was needed.Not everything I have to say is positive as there were a few things that did have me not enjoy as much as other people have. First off, as much as I liked the characters, after a certain point, the movie takes a comedic route by going into a montage and the film skips over a few consequences or ends subplots that were introduced at the beginning of the film so quickly to the point where it felt like it wasn't necessary. I wanted to see more of a conclusion, instead of a quick scene to show to know that some problems are resolved and will never come back.One of the major complaints is that parts of the film felt like I am sitting at a park, enjoying the scenery with someone dear to me, when suddenly, a band pops out of the bushes and starts singing their songs a couple of centimeters away from me. The band, Radwimps, did a great job and made a good soundtrack. However, just like in a lot of Japanese films and dramas, they tend to go very melodramatic and they add the music at the right time to sell their soundtrack, along with forcing people to feel a certain emotion. I instantly got annoyed when they started the movie with an anime style opening and would blast up their music so high that I couldn't focus or hear what the characters were saying. This would happen constantly throughout the film to the point that it got distracting and I wanted to plug my ears until the song had finished.Despite what I said, I'm pretty sure there are people out there that don't mind those kind of things and they would enjoy the movie more. I personally don't like and still enjoyed it overall. I'm glad this movie was a big hit as we will be able to see more top quality animation from Makoto.",8,0,0,4 September 2019
John Wick," An original action flick that takes you for an awesome ride.
","The bait and switch that occurs here is fantastic. You start off watching John Wick mourning the death of his wife and rediscovers the meaning of life when he receives a puppy. When things hit the fan, you start to understand that there is more to the protagonist and immediately enter this bloodbath massacre with this complete badass. The plot is simple and yet you clearly understand the motivation and that this is one guy who you don't want to mess with. It's painful to see what happens, but the clear motivation is enough for even us to be onboard and cheering for this awesome character to kill some baddies.Keanu doesn't get a lot of lines, but I thought he worked perfectly well here being such a tyrant with all of the stunt work and action scenes that he had done for this film. Which leads to one of the best things I can say and that is the action. Everything from the cinematography to the choreography, everything was shot in such detail, making this action flick so stylish and fun to watch. There were plenty of times where I reacted out loud just on how brutal or amazing a certain kill was. Based on the motivation of the character, watching him get his revenge is so satisfying, making this stand out from the more recent revenge flicks we have been getting. With so much memorable moments, it is hard to recall which was the most entertaining or which part of the film I had enjoyed the most. Every single moment brings in that necessary punch and not overstaying its welcome by showing too much action.What this film gets right is building its world. You enter this world of assassins and rather than having long expositions that explain what goes around there, you are given enough glimpses and hints of the lore that has you intrigued and wanting to know more. The characters are all suave and each have their own characteristics, making this revenge flick all the more interesting. Everyone from the owner Winston, to even a few assassins that John Wick interacts with has such personality to them, making them quite memorable, despite the amount of screentime they have.Even with its sequels, this film is still so fun to watch and its rewatchable. Definitely recommend this for anyone who loves action.",9,1,1,24 September 2019
Rocketman," Everything I wanted 'Bohemian Rhapsody' to be.
","I do not hate the film, but I do not like the reputation that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has received (Best Picture nomination, seriously!?) and thought that it was a hugely overrated film filled with flaws. What that film failed to do, this film did it in spades. The film does follow the typical beats of a biopic and it's a formula that is hard to get away from. However, what director Dexter Fletcher did here was to focus onto the life of Elton John as a musical and in a very nice fashion, used various songs of his to tell this story and I thought that was brilliant. I don't know much detail about Elton John, so it was nice to learn a little about this great singer and to know the life that he had lived. If you've seen or heard stories about famous musicians, they tend to tell the same story and had similar problems from addiction to music producers. This is no exception as this film does tell a similar tale, but at the same time, I was intrigued with this film and just enjoyed watching this story. Another great point is that the people involved in this movie did a great job recreating some parts of his life, but to make costumes that are really close to the original. The best thing that this film had done was to have me interested and wanting to listen to his music.I've always liked Taron Edgerton and I thought he was absolutely phenomenal here as he acted his butt off and actually sang proving how great of an actor he is. Without a doubt, he really deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role. From the first time you see him, he embodied himself as Elton John and for the whole film, he was able to bring so much emotion to his role, allowing us as a viewer to connect and sympathize with him. His singing is amazing and I really liked the fact that he actually sang those songs rather than using another person to sing it for him. Edgerton is not only the stand out role as every single person in this film was great! Jamie Bell was great and I never knew he had singing chops. Richard Madden was amazing and brought a sense of cynicism to his character. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh as the parents of Elton were such terrible parents, especially the father and their performances were so good that you simply despise them and sympathize more with Elton. I won't say much, but I absolutely hated his father in this movie.One of the major surprises of the film was that this was a full on musical. I expected to see the basic biopic story, but to tell this story as a musical and actually using his music as a base to tell the story was a pretty smart choice. Most of the musical numbers were extravagant with great visuals and unique shots, along with having a cast who can sing. Each number did allow us to see what Elton was going through, from his ups and downs to showing part of his life that was filled with joy to this downward spiral he had entered due to his addiction.I'm praising this film a lot, but I did have a few minor gripes. I did feel that there were parts of the movie, mostly in the third act that dragged a bit, which felt that the film had gone a tad bit too long. Also, some of the musical numbers, as well sung as they were, felt a bit too overbearing in the third act and I felt that the movie focused more on the singing rather than the actual dialogue. There are moments where after a song, the characters will briefly talk and then the film will jump to a new song. I would have been nice to have a little breather in between rather than having a slew of songs being sung back to back.Overall, this is definitely one of the best films of this year and Edgerton does deserve an Oscar nod for his performance here. If you love musicals or are interested in the life of Elton John, then I highly recommend this film.",8,3,4,26 August 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's take on a war film.
","This is Tarantino's take on a war film, mixing his style that he has perfected and used throughout his career and it works perfectly well here. The amount of detail that he adds to this movie is splendid and I really liked how much he focuses more on the dramatic side than the action. You still have your over the top violence, in which I enjoy watching, but it worked well here and it never went overboard. What does happen may surprise some people as Tarantino does something that does deviate itself from reality and enters his fantasy. Thanks to his craft, there are also several scenes here that really increases the tension and had me on the edge of my seat thinking what will happen. Because anything can happen at any minute, he expects us to expect the unexpected and when something does happen, you'll end up being surprised with the outcome and maybe get a laugh out of it, as I tend to laugh with the wildness and surprise of what occurs.One thing that does have to be said though is that this is Tarantino's world, so it's best not to expect this film to follow history to a tee. Just like in 'Kill Bill,' he tells the story in chapters and he implements these characters together as we get to know who they are, along with seeing them intertwine with each other for the climax. With great pacing and pure entertainment sprinkled throughout the film, fans will be able to enjoy it and be invested in the plot. However, I do have to say that the subplot involving Shosanna was a little weak. Her character is interesting and I am invested in her plan. However, even though the performances were great here, I felt that Frederick Zoller, portrayed by Daniel Bruhl, was fairly uninteresting. His character was a little too oblivious to how Shosanna feels, which made him a bit obnoxious and didn't have anything to do until the climax. Felt more like he was needed for the plot to happen and was not really a memorable character compared to everyone else. You do understand the pain that he feels, but other than that, he felt like the weakest character out of everyone.I liked that Tarantino went for more of a foreign approach here with the majority of the film being dialogue not spoken in English. As the film has characters involved in foreign lands, it's a pretty risky but smart move to have these characters speak in their native tongue rather than going for the safe route of having them speak English. Most of the cast was not well known to regular moviegoers at the time and they had the most time on the screen. It even went so far to the point of having someone like Brad Pitt not playing a major role and being pushed to the side line until the third act of the film. Not having your top billing actor throughout the movie is a bold decision, but it is also a very nice decision as all of the performances were great and it allows us to see more great actors who we can look forward to seeing. Everyone did a great job, but most of all, Christoph Waltz. His character was very unpredictable and was so fun to see every time he was on screen. When he appears, he steals the show and you know that something is bound to happen with him appearing on the scene. His presence alone adds the tension and unpredictability on what will occur.There are a few scenes that do feel out of place, such as having a blacksploitation logo pop out of nowhere to introduce a character, along with having some of the minor characters in Aldo's squad being put to the sidelines, not having any major to do throughout the movie; even to the point of disappearing without explanation. Some of these can be nitpicks and I do admit that. But in the end, this film is still fun to watch and is another great film by Tarantino.",9,0,3,16 September 2019
Captain Marvel," An enjoyable, but flawed film that introduces a new character to the MCU
","One major thing that people have said is that this film is great for 'Phase One' of the MCU and that is absolutely true. The more recent films in this universe either raises the stakes for these heroes, adds more depth to them or does something unique to make it very worth watching. Although, I did enjoy it and want to see more of this character, this film didn't do anything to actually WOW me in any sort of way.There weren't any cool shots or standout scenes, even though I did enjoy all of the superhero stuff. The moment Captain Marvel uses her powers and starts using her abilities, we understand that she is a big deal and can be a huge asset for the heroes of Earth. Sadly, the characters didn't have enough personality for them to be memorable. For the most part, the plot is interesting by handling Carol Denvers adventure in rediscovering who she is and finding her place in this world, but I thought the execution could have been handled more carefully as the film did have some potential to go deeper with the characters. There was never that spark or flare that I've loved to see in an origin film and felt a little bit bland compared to the others. The characters that we have seen before, such as Nick Fury, is always nice to see as he and Denvers had good chemistry and provided a lot of the humor together. Excluding a few of the new characters, the rest were uninteresting and kind of had nothing to do.People do complain about Brie Larson and I thought she did fine here. She was able to bring a sense of personality to the character and although she isn't as interesting as the other characters in the MCU, Larson did the best with what she was given. Samuel L. Jackson is always great as Nick Fury and I'm glad we've got more screen time with him as this film provides as a prequel and we get to know who he is as a character. He brings in the humor and liked every single moment with him. One major plus is the special effects team by making him look so much younger, there was never a time where I noticed that it was fake. Ben Mendelsohn is actually pretty good here and I liked all they did with his character. One actor I'm actually disappointed in and not because of he was bad, but because he had nothing to do was Jude Law. I wanted to see more Jude Law here and if they film was able to put him more to build a bond and relationship between his character and Larson's, then it would have made his character even more interesting.The stuff that happens on Earth is easily the best part of the film as it was able to bring the comedy and entertainment. However, I wished that the film focuses more on the Star Force team which would have helped add more tension and conflict throughout the film. Some of them do appear in other films and it had potential for us to get to know them. Instead, we only get a glimpse of these soldiers and do not have any sort of understanding of who they are and not being able to connect with them. After the first act, they disappear and appear again for the climax in which wasn't executed well as I don't remember their names or their abilities.One thing that I did like was that the movie had a few twists that surprised me. I expected things to happen a certain way based on discussions I had about the characters and based on the trailer only to have the film to do something unexpectedly. The pacing and the overall story is still fun to watch, but because of the caliber of the previous films, it just feels weaker than usual. Also, one final remark, all of this talk and 'controversy' I never had a single moment of Marvel bringing in politics to cinema. I have talked to some people who did not like parts of the film due to the fact that they believed the agenda that Marvel was trying to push. You see what you want to see and I saw a decent, but flawed superhero flick that is enjoyable to watch.",7,5,6,24 September 2019
Spirited Away," Easily one of Studio Ghibli's best work of all time.
","With such a huge filmography, it is difficult to consider which one is the best out of everything that Studio Ghibli has released. Just like with Disney, people will have a different, but understandable preference toward why they consider that film to be the best. One thing that people can agree on is that this film is one of the best out of everything that Studio Ghibli has made throughout the years.Mixing in culture with fantasy, I loved how you become totally engrossed in this world and will be in total wonderment as you go on this journey with Chihiro. Sprinkling in humor and emotional moments throughout the film, this really helped the flow of the film and making it very fun to watch and embracing everything that happens. Never looking down on the audience, this film doesn't spell out everything for you, allowing us to figure things out and to find the answers on our own. Even just by watching the film again, you are able to catch certain details that you may have missed while watching it for the first time. The biggest strength of this film are the characters. For example, you are able to embark on this journey with Chihiro and you see her growth as a character, becoming more mature as the story progresses. Even with some of the sub-characters, you see them grow as well, making this journey very worthwhile, along with making this film very rewatchable.This film is enriched with very colorful characters who are very memorable and have such interesting personalities to them that has them stand out with every scene they are in. From Yubaba, even with some of the gods that enter the bathhouse, I loved every single character that had appeared and they all helped add life to the whole movie. Surprisingly enough, the voice work here does help as well. I'm judging on the Japanese version here, so bare with me. Many of the actors chosen are not professional and there isn't a single weak point in the acting. Usually, Ghibli films will hire actors who are sometimes really good, but for most of the time are subpar passable or terrible. This is not the case as everyone was wellcasted and I loved everyone's performance.Mixing such beautiful art with Hisaishi Jo's music helps add more personality to the overall film. I have to say that this may be the most beautiful film from Studio Ghibli. The mix of colors and from the look of the bathhouse to the scenery, the film has such a great look that makes it very beautiful to look at. There are plenty of memorable moments here that can be a painting of itself and mixing all of these great elements together really helps make this film stand out from the other Ghibli films and is still worth watching up till this day.",10,1,1,17 September 2019
Toy Story 4," Who would have thought that this would be so much better than anticipated!
","Here is a movie that many people, including myself, were disappointed to hear when this movie was announced, especially after watching the few trailers that was released beforehand. However, after finally getting to see this film, I really have to say that not only was I so surprised with this movie, but this movie is simply one of the best movies that I have seen this year. One of the major surprises was the actual plot itself. It's surprisingly deep and it deals with very complex emotions and situations extremely well to where it had me connect with the major characters and I understood how each character felt, along with understanding the decisions that they make throughout the movie. I was a little worried with where the film would go because I knew that the film had to revolve around the new character, Forkie, but everything was woven together perfectly where his addition to the story and this overall plot makes sense, along with delivering on the fun factor that I did not expect from this movie. Here is a plot where there isn't a dull moment at sight, something is always happening and the amount of humor and emotional scenes either had me laughing or crying a river.With every Pixar film, they always improve their CG and the film looks absolutely amazing! The characters look great and everything from the background to the look of an antique store looks very realistic. It's so good to where even the ventriloquist dummies were scary and had the creepiness that I tend to feel when I actually look at one. There is a scene involving rain and it's scary how realistic it looks. This is such an amazing achievement, especially with a film in its fourth entry.Just like in the previous films, all of the characters that you love are back and it's always nice to see them on screen, along with hearing Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as their iconic roles. I am a little sad to see some of the more popular characters being put to the side line, but this is necessary as the main focus is on Woody, Buzz and the new characters that appear in the movie. These new characters are great additions to the series and all of them are great for their own reasons. Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key as Bunny and Duckie were extremely funny and had me cracking up throughout the movie. Forkie, voiced by Tony Hale, started off annoying, but he started to grow on me and I ended up caring for him by the end of the film. Even thinking about the character just made me understand his characteristics a bit more. A very interesting concept and actually one of the more interesting characters in the film. Duke Caboom was also great, adding a lot of humor to his scenes and Keanu Reeves, who is having a great year, helping make this character to be likable. Annie Potts really helped bring a lot of personality to Bo Peep. Finally, Gabby Gabby, voiced by Chrisitna Hendricks is surprisingly a deep character that had me in tears when it came to the end of her subplot. From humor to having great emotional depth, all of these characters revolved around the overall story perfectly well and I really liked every single character here.Words cannot describe how much I loved this movie and on how much I really appreciate the effort that the people involved with this movie put into this film. I couldn't stop crying even after the credits stopped rolling and that shows how much of an impact it had on me. For fans of the series, I think they will notice a few things that have continued from the previous films, such as character growth and feeling the bond that these characters share. Some people may not like the minor changes with the characters or may not be fully invested as much as me, but this movie did something that surprised so many people and it's definitely something that should be watched, especially with people who loved the overall series.",9,1,8,17 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Really glad this film didn't disappoint.
","I do understand the complaints that this film has been receiving and I do see the criticisms for this film. However, I have to say that despite all of that, I absolutely loved this film and I'm really glad to see that Quentin Tarantino was able to make another great film.As a fan of his movies, this movie has everything that I enjoy: you have the awesome dialogue, great and memorable characters, incredible cinematography and fantastic directing. Unlike his other films, this is not linear and there is a point at the second act where the plot deviates away from the main plot. However, just like his other films, Tarantino is able to make a film with great pacing despite that and I had a blast. There will be some people who will not have the same enthusiasm as I have as it may bore some people and just may lose interest toward the overall film because of it. Regarding the overall plot, I enjoyed watching the friendship between the two leads and just watching Rick Dalton, portrayed by Leonardo Di Caprio, just trying to put his name out there and still be relevant. One of the things that I have enjoyed was to see Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, portrayed by Brad Pitt, interact with real life characters of the time period and to see them be involved with this moment of Hollywood. It helped add personality and it allowed us to see some pretty nice and at times, funny moments with these characters.Surprisingly enough, this film doesn't have a lot of the overly violent scenes and I was overly surprised by the amount of dialogue and comedy that was implemented in this film. I laughed quite a bit and even enjoyed some of the in-jokes that he has about the movie industry and about some of the films from his filmography. Now, the violence is still there and when it hits, I think it was more impactful due to the fact that it was absent throughout the whole film. When it hits, it's shocking, surprising and funny at the same time. Definitely one of the very few times that I have reacted out loud in a movie theater.From the poster, people will know that Margot Robbie is in the film and she is playing Sharon Tate.. This is a small gripe that I do have toward the film. Sharon Tate is one of the major characters of the movie and I feel that she wasn't utilized in the film well enough. I have an idea toward why Tarantino wanted to focus onto her and in that concept, I think he did the best that he could to make her appearance in the film work. For some people, they may not get the idea and just find her appearance to be rather pointless and some may not find the focus on some of the recognizable faces of Hollywood at the time to be worth watching. Tarantino is making a love letter for that time period so unless you love movies or you enjoy Tarantino's style of humor, this may cause people to not be invested.Without a doubt, Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt were the best parts of the movie. They show why they are the best in Hollywood now and I just loved that they are playing actual characters. I tend to see them playing very serious roles and they are still good, but I missed when they were able to show their range of acting. I think they were able to do so here as Di Caprio was very funny and he brought a lot of personality to his character, along with Pitt. They both have great chemistry together and I've enjoyed every single moment they were onscreen.If some of the scenes were cut shorter and if some of the characters were more well written and used well, then I would have really have no gripes toward the film and would have put this on my top. This is a fun Tarantino film and I feel that fans will have a blast watching this film.",9,5,7,6 September 2019
Django Unchained," This maybe my least favorite Tarantino film.
","Depending on where you stand, this film has splitted moviegoers. From his overuse of the racial term and people simply finding this film frustrating as he doesn't take this matter seriously as other films about slavery, people tend to not like this film. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed it and I do somewhat agree with the complaints that I have heard. He does use that particular word too much and it did become redundant after a while. I loved the majority of this film due to Tarantino's great talent behind the camera as he is able to have some pretty cool shots and bringing in the humor and shock factor very well.Adding his take on the western with a mixture of blacksploitation, the plot of this film was quite enjoyable. The first act introduces the main characters well, being performed greatly by the actors who made their friendship believable. The third act brought the over the top violence and entertainment factor very well. However, I really felt that, despite the second act having some great scenes, this is the weakest part of the film and it completely halted the movie for me. I loved the introduction of Calvin Candie, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and the interactions that he has with the main characters shows how great Tarantino's writing is. It is what happens after this scene that really has me feel the pace slow down. It felt like Tarantino wanted to focus more on the violence of slavery and overpushed the brutality of it with scenes that are very uncomfortable to watch and overstayed their welcome by stretching it out for longer than it should have been. It is when they are having dinner when the film picks back its pace and you will watch an incredible performance by DiCaprio in a scene that is very intense and well shot.Tarantino brings in great performances and there are two major standouts. Christolph Waltz once again was great as he portrayed Dr. King Schultz. His character is very likable and Waltz is so charismatic to where he is able to bring in a deep personality to the character. The other stand out is DiCaprio as he also brings his charm and that scene I mentioned earlier shows why his character is very menacing and downright scary. I was in awe watching him act in this scene and this scene alone is one of the reasons why I love DiCaprio as an actor. About Jamie Foxx, he was good and I did like his character, but I felt that he didn't wow me like the other two. He made the character cool and I enjoyed watching him shoot up some baddies. It's just that it felt more like a character he played in his previous action flicks. As much of a great actress she is, Kerry Washington was really wasted here. All she did in the film was to scream and react. There were too many reaction shots of her and she was under utilized to the point that it had me wondering if her character was actually important or not. Basically, this character could have been portrayed by anyone.I'm always debating which film of his is weaker and I tend to lean toward 'Jackie Brown' and this film, just due to the fact that there were a lot of recognizable flaws that made me lose interest with the story, which had me wondering when the pacing would come back. But with Tarantino's talent and all of the positives I've mentioned earlier, this film is still worth watching, despite the huge negatives that I had.",8,0,3,6 September 2019
Room," An amazing movie with so many things to appreciate.
","I didn't watch the trailer, so I never knew what exactly was going on. So when I started watching the movie, I was genuinely surprised and shocked with the circumstances that these characters had to go through, along with how deep and emotional this movie was. The film was able to do so much skill from the director and being able to bring a heavy hitting emotional film.I really liked how the film allowed us to be in the perspective of the child and to see the world from his point of view. You can tell from where they were that something is off about the room the mom and Jack were living in; especially with how cramped and dirty it looked. However, as we see it in his perspective, we understand that since this was the only thing that he knows, we see the beauty and the enjoyment that he has in that small place. Even when they escape the room, you see everything in a new light as we are in Jack's shoes and a simple room in a hospital will look heavenly. You see everything as if you are seeing it for the first time and this is what the director was able to do very well. The cinematography and the overall structure of the scene works perfectly well, allowing us to be in his shoes and to be amazed with the boy.This is not an easy film to sit through due to the bleakness and how daunting what the mother and son had gone through, along with her parents can be. This film provides so much depth and emotion to all of the characters and I cannot help but give praise for what this film was able to accomplish. As the mom and her son was able to get out of their room, I really loved that we get to see how something like this can ruin people emotionally and that things do not end happily so soon. We usually see the family become happy and the characters who had gone through trauma will miraculously get over it. But this film doesn't do that as it dives deeper into the turmoil of what had happened. The main character is going through some emotional distraint, the boy is struggling to understand the new reality he has entered and we see that the parents of the main character also have to struggle to deal with their new reality. Despite all of this, not everything is a disaster as there were moments of enjoyment and happiness that had me tearing up. Which is another reason why I loved this movie. The film perfectly combines the darkness with the heartfelt moments well, adding more emotional element to the overall story.Every character here goes through so much and this is all due to the performances. Brie Larson was absolutely amazing as Jack's mom. She has to carry part of the film and the emotion that she was able to deliver was just great. I really liked that we get to see that even after it is over, things won't go back as they were before and you see the inner turmoil that she goes through. She did deserve every praise and awards she has received for this film based on what she brought to this movie. Also, even at a young age, Jacob Tremblay gave such a fantastic performance. Just like with Larson, he provided a lot of depth and emotion to the character as he also has to carry the film and based on his performance alone. I was able to buy that he knew nothing outside of the room he stayed in and that he is totally oblivious to the world around him. You also have great performances from Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Tom McCamus, whom I really liked, especially with what he does in the film.Even watching it a second time, the emotion and the tension that I felt, the connection I felt with these characters and crying non stop in some of the more emotional scenes really made me appreciate this film and consider this as one of my favorite films of all time.",10,2,4,4 September 2019
The Lion King," The same story + CG + blandness = pointless
","Yes, the CG for this film is phenomenal and it looks absolutely realistic. Yes, this film is an exact copy of what we have seen in the animated version. Yes, the film totally lacks the necessary emotion and intensity that was present in the original. If you've seen the original Lion King, then there is no point of watching this movie. Unlike Jon Favreau's previous film, this film doesn't present anything new and just follows the same beat and pace of the original with some very minor scenes that I actually thought was both good and bad for the film.First, the good: This is a bit of a nitpick of mine, but one of my major gripes that I have toward the climax from the original was that the film mixed in cultural references (Pumba saying a line from 'They Call Me Mister Tibbs!) and Rafiki going all kung-fu. This movie took these parts out of the film and actually made them relevant enough to the climax and not feeling out of place. Another is that the movie adds extra scenes that explained how Nara escaped from Pride Rock and came to Timon and Pumba's home. Also, their home now has more side characters living there, making it more lively and less empty than how it was in the original.Now to the bad: Rafiki had nothing to do and the whole scene involving him giving the speech to adult Simba about the past is totally absent; taking away the great message that the film had. Another factor was that, although it is not 100% bad, the characteristics of the hyenas changed. I don't mind them changing Shenzi from a comedic character to a menacing one. What I didn't like was that the other hyenas had nothing to do, had no personality and had one joke that was both unfunny and awkward, especially coming right after the death of Mufasa. One more factor that really disappointed me was that when it came to the big song numbers that people loved to listen to, there would be a lot going on in the scene. However, if the musical number is not so, then it just looks bland and uninteresting to watch. An example is 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' and 'Be Prepared.' The duet number has the characters going around and has them enjoying their time together, in the daylight. Whereas the latter is just plain and simple, with nothing going on.The major complaints that people have mentioned was that this film just felt lifeless because the characters do not have any sort of reaction and that is partially true. The characters all look realistic and because of that, they lack the expressions that we've seen in the original. But that is not the only reason why I felt that the movie didn't have the proper emotion. In the original, the characters would not only have expressions that were easy to understand, but the film had great dynamic shots that added an impact when you saw something intense happening to the characters or when something tragic occurs in the film. The directing and in my opinion, most of the voice acting really liked the actual emotions that were present. Even James Earl Jones, whom is always great to listen to, felt like he was just reading the script to him and didn't have that deep emotion that was present before. This really shows as, other than Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and the kids who played young Simba and Nara, everyone else gave a flat performance and didn't help add personality to the character. Mixing all of these mistakes will make something that has been loved for many years look weak.Just like some of the other remakes, this really felt like it was only piggybacking the success of the original and because of that I felt that the movie missed out on some potentials to be as successful or surpass the original. I didn't absolutely hate this and I see how many people will feel disappointed or will hate this movie. It's just an okay film and overall I recommend watching the original instead of this. If you want to see some amazing CG, then by all means you should check it out.",5,3,3,22 August 2019
The Dark Knight," The best of the best.
","Nolan brought a very serious tone here, by taking the caped crusader and making him grounded enough to where nothing that happens in the movie seems out of place or feels unrealistic. The whole conflict that is built up here really pays off as you see how these two characters are total opposites and how the Joker challenges Batman to his limits as a human and as a hero. I loved every single second of this movie as Nolan's attention to detail, along with a well structured story, really elevated this movie to its greatness. I love that throughout the movie, there are things happening to where if you miss it, it won't ruin the story in any sort of way, but if you catch it, you'll be able to appreciate the amount of detail that Nolan put into this movie. The whole movie will have you feel tensed as anything can happen at any moment and knowing that the Joker is somewhere ready to strike makes this film even more better.I think one thing that people don't fully talk about is how Nolan really surprises you in this film. Not only with the character interpretations, but there were a few scenes that I thought would happen one way and totally revealed something that surprised me a lot. It'll be something like two characters are having a normal conversation and then out of nowhere, you're frightened as something comes out of the blue and you see that the chaos is about to start. It can also be where you expect the hero will stand on top only to see that they fall down to the bottom.I do have a small gripe and it's mostly with the fight sequences. I've seen the making and I know why Batman's techniques are of a certain style, but even up to this day, I still think it doesn't look as cool as they intended and it still doesn't work for me. It puts me out of the film a little and I just wished that would have been fixed. This is not my complaint as I loved every single minute, but some may find the film to be too long and that some parts, rather very few of it, could be cut out of the film.Although he still does the growly voice, I still think Christian Bale is one of the best actors to portray as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The movie doesn't focus much on the Bruce Wayne persona due to the fact that we have seen that in the previous film, but Bale continues to do a great job. You also have a lot of great performances from the cast with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaced Katie Holmes, did a better job as Rachel. He doesn't get much credit, but I really liked Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent showing both sides of the character that fans have recognized through animation and video games. I'm not counting Tommy Lee Jones as his interpretation of the character was pretty bad. What they did with Harvey turning into Two Face was shocking and I loved the look. This is where Eckhart shines even more as he starts off as one way, but when you see him become that character, he totally embraces the role and being able to be the same character, but in a different way. But the guy that stole the show was none other than Heath Ledger as the Joker. He was able to portray this iconic character very cynically, bringing in the unpredictability of the character that will make feel scared, wondering what he will do next. The chaos that the character brings to the film easily puts him as one of the most iconic and memorable villains of this generation. I wanted to see more of the Joker and more of his interactions with Batman.With so much memorable moments and iconic shots throughout, this is a film that has you so focused on what is happening to where you don't want to miss a single moment. It is not a perfect film with very minor flaws that you will notice if you think about it way too hard. Despite that, I still loved this film and I can't recommend this enough. Not only is it a great Batman film and not only is it a great superhero film, but it's a film that will forever be helmed as one of the greats of all time.",10,0,2,4 September 2019
The Disaster Artist," A film that could have been better only if...
","Here is a movie that was perfectly gift wrapped for them from the start: a movie so terrible that reached cult status, a great book and audiobook that depicts everything involving the complex friendship between these two people, along with the hilarious details that depict the behind the scenes of this movie. However, due to James Franco's inexperienced directing and changes, I feel that the movie was good and fun to watch, but wasn't able to be the great movie it was meant to be.I may be biased here as I really loved the audiobook and Greg Sestero went to great detail into everything that happened and doing a very good impression of his friend, Tommy Wiseau. One problem I've had with this movie was the miscasting of the main characters and with James Franco himself. He did a decent job doing the voice and gave a nice performance, but it only felt like an impersonation rather than him embracing the role. I only saw Franco being Tommy and Franco was able to be funny as this person, but didn't feel like he was the right match for the character and the makeup didn't fully work on him. You have a lot of recognizable faces in the cast and many of them do a decent job in their roles, however, the film felt a little rushed and didn't focus too much on the overall reactions and chaos that these people had to go through during production. Franco's directing also doesn't pay off as there were times that the film did drag on and lost it's pace during some of the scenes. The way he would film a scene and the structure of the story felt a little imbalanced at times and wished he would have made it a bit more cohesive.You can tell that Franco had his heart in the right place as he wanted to respect Tommy for what he had done, especially toward the film that he had made. I really liked how the movie portrayed the friendship between these two men who are just total opposites of each other. You do get an understanding how these two developed an odd relationship that has continued to this day. Also, seeing the actors portraying what happened on set really brought the humor and entertainment. I laughed at the bits that they have focused on. However, this is another fault of the movie as I felt that the movie didn't go all out. The film only focused on a few parts on what happened during production and I felt that there were a few more things that could have been added to really add more juice to the overall film. It lacks the seriousness and the tension that had built up from the people on set and only had the people simply being annoyed and not doing anything else with them.I do not hate this movie and rather enjoyed myself, but because I've listened to the audiobook, the changes that Franco made and his directing made me feel a little disappointed. It's still worth watching and quite enjoyable, but I do think that by having a better director and having someone who does have experience behind the camera could have made this movie better than it was. It's clear that Franco wanted to focus more on the production rather than the characters. If he was able to balance both of them out perfectly, then this would have been an even better movie than what had turned out.",7,2,2,20 August 2019
The Purge," A good premise with lackluster presentation.
","The film does have an interesting premise that would have been better utilized if it was as a social commentary, but instead, this film is a generic thriller that doesn't go through with what they have introduced in the beginning and delivered a film that was more of a snore than a thrill. The film doesn't do anything with this concept and fails to have us see and develop our own opinion toward this one night event of murder. Instead, we are given dialogue and exposition to know how successful it is.What would have made this film better was to allow us to get to know the characters a little more by having them react to this event and to see their perspectives of this night. By doing this, we get to connect with them more and to feel for them when things get out of hand later on. What we are treated with instead is a plot of literally nothing going on until the last 20 minutes of the film. I did, however, enjoy a few aspects of the film, such as the climax and how they ended it, but until then, nothing really happens in this film. There are no conversations or conflicts between the characters about killing people, there is nothing at stake and most of all, these people are not interesting.The film follows a typical trope and doesn't do anything new and exciting to allow people to be invested in it. When things get out of hand, that is where the film does deliver the fun aspect, although the execution was a bit sloppy. There is a bunch of nothing happening here and it's sad to see that despite what they have here, the director didn't do anything with it. Also, the film fails to give a proper explanation toward how and why something happened. Everything happens in order for the plot to progress and because there is no proper explanation, it just feels lazy and further deepens my disinterest toward the film. Even when the characters are faced with a certain dilemma, they either do nothing with it or is quickly resolved in a second without any sort of explanation to why people made the decisions they made.Each character follows the annoying trope of doing something stupid, even to the point of having one character disappear throughout the movie and just being a waste of presence until this character does something heroic at the end. It's sad as none of the characters stand out, despite having two great lead actors. I did like Rhys Wakefiled, who plays the absurdly psychotic character. He added a strong presence based on his performance and he made it a bit interesting to watch.Due to the lack of excitement, logic and a properly structured story, I felt that this film failed to be something memorable, despite having a few good scenes here and there.",4,0,1,30 August 2019
