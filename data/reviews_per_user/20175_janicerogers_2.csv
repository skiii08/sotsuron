The Longest Yard," Lots of fun!
","I really liked this movie. I had low expectations since I'm not a big fan of Burt Reynolds. But even he acquitted himself well. I laughed out loud so many times I embarrassed myself. And despite all the testosterone- and steroid-infused bodies, rough stuff on the football field and in the prison, there was a real sweetness about the story. Adam Sandler is growing on me. Chris Rock also turned in a good performance. He's sure funnier when he's not using four-letter words in every sentence.If I have any complaints it's that my home state, Texas, is again a caricature of meanness. But I guess I'll take the bad with the good and recommend this movie. You'll enjoy it. We sure did.",9,2,7,28 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Buddhist propaganda
","OK, OK...Strip away the nostalgia. Strip away the 'must-see-it-ness' of the sixth and final (which was really the third because the first in the series was actually the fourth... oh never mind!) movie in a series which defined our generation. What are you left with? A mediocre film with so-so storytelling and a big heaping side serving of Buddhism.If anyone were to lace a movie with this much sermonizing from a Christian perspective, the media and pundits would be howling. But because of the rule that every religion *but* Christianity deserves respect in Hollywood, no one says a word.Then there's the obvious slam against President Bush and all conservatives. In reply to, 'You're either with us or against us!' comes, 'Only a Sith believes in absolutes!' Well then, I guess I'm a Sith because right and wrong actually matter in my book.I found the movie mildly entertaining. If I can go buy popcorn in the middle of a film and not even complain about the long line at the concession stand, that is not a particularly engaging movie. It certainly wasn't the most entertaining flick I've seen lately. For that, I'd have to give nods to 'Kingdom of Heaven' and 'Crash.' Those were good old edge-of-your-seat dramas.I noticed Lucas was the only one credited for writing this lumbering clunker. Could it be that the huge success of this franchise has completely isolated Mr. Lucas from any outside person willing to tell him when something isn't all that great? Has anyone in Marin County had the nerve to tell him that the last three movies were boooo-ring?",6,1,2,23 May 2005
