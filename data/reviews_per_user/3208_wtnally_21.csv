Requiem for a Dream," one of the best movies i have seen in a while, and one of the best ever made
","Darren aronofsky directs this amazing film that centers around Sara goldfarb, harry goldfarb, Marion silver and Tyrone c love and their addictions. Jared leto gives a unbelievable performance along with Ellen burstyn who is breath taking. i warn you though, when purchasing or renting the unrated version, it gets very pornographic, but is still a awesome movie. i have heard so many people telling me how good it is, so i bought it one day, watched it, loved it. its one of those movies though that i can only watch maybe two or three times after seeing it. i highly recommend this film to anyone with any interest or are fans of the actors and directors. i loved it. 10/10",10,1,2,4 August 2006
The Ring," how was this made?
","seriously... how was this made? how could the production companies make this film. here is the pros and cons.... good directing, decent acting, horrible ending, stupid plot. can you even call this a 'horror' movie? i call horror the hills have eyes (2006), or halloween, those are HORROR movies. this sucked. its ironic because gore verbinski directed this Stupid film, but directed the awesome hit pirates of the Caribbean. do your self a favor and skip over this film and just check something else out, this isn't worth the time or money. and i am sorry for any crew worker that helped out with this film. i hated this movie! 1/10",1,0,5,23 May 2006
Fight Club," What? WEIRD
","this film has to be the most confusing movie i've seen right up until i figured it ALL out. At first i HATED this film with a passion, but David Fincher has always been one of my favorites with Se7en, and the game and panic room, he know how to direct very well. If u don't like complicating movies that are just plain weird, don't see this. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton totally are 2 of the BEST actors on the planet. I'm not going to tell you what this movie is about because i want you to see for yourself, but just remember, be WIDE AWAKE because it is long, confusing and weird. it has a NON original ending, but probably one of the best of it's series. it's OK. 8/10",8,0,2,1 May 2006
Hostel," wow. good job Eli Roth!
","disgusting! brilliant! a true horror movie! Eli Roth is now one of my ALL TIME favorite directors with this film. he gets all the true elements horror movie's have. this is one of my all time favorite films. i LOVED cabin fever, and expected no less from this movie, but i got more! Eli Roth has been one of my HUGE inspirations to go to film school and become a film director. I have to warn you though, it is pretty gross, but it is one hell of a movie! The first forty five minutes, there is quite a bit of nudity, but, it's all part of the plot, trust me.... u will enjoy this movie. Seeing this in the theater, i was SCARED to death! But now that i see Eli has more movies coming out, I'm so excited! He's right there with Wes Craven and Alexandre Aja on Horror movie directing. Possibly better? 9/10",9,2,3,29 April 2006
Batman Returns," best super hero movie ever
","this is, in my opinion, better than all xmen, spider-man, fantastic 4 which i hated, superman and hulk movies. along with big fish, this is Tim Burton's best film, packed with action and i believe to be the best batman film of all of them. Michelle pheiffer did a outstanding job playing cat woman, which was almost all taken away by the HORRIBLE- MUST STAY AWAY! film, cat woman. Mikael Keaton also does a great job playing batman. Danny DE Vito also did a great job as well. Tim Burton takes all his elements, Danny elf man music, dark directing, and a little humor and makes this a truly AWESOME film. i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. watch batman then this then just skip batman forever and batman and robin, go to batman begins. i loved it! 10/10",10,4,10,20 May 2006
The Village," don't be so quick to judge, you either love it, or you don't
","may contain spoilers!!!! another great M Night Shyamalan movie. along with the sixth sense, signs and unbreakable, i think this is probably his second best film, with the sixth sense being number 1. this is a BRILLIANT film about a small town deep in the woods that fear of the things which they do not speak of. one incident happens in which three people are sent out to get medicine because Jaquin's character was stabbed. along the way, Bryce Dallas Howard's character realizes the shocking truth to the whole village with a unbelievable ending. i honestly LOVED this film, some will and some won't. you will either love it or hate it. i loved it. 9/10",9,0,2,30 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," best horror movie EVER made
","this is by far the best horror movie ever made. it started out with psycho,halloween, went to Friday the 13th, then to nightmare on elm street, scream and now to the great hills have eyes. If you do see this, believe me, it's gross, disturbing, and very hard to watch. I have always enjoyed Wes Craven's films, but this beat the sh!t out of the original. Better screenplay, better directing, it's like they just took every idea from the hills have eyes, and made it ten times better. Alexandre Aja does a outstanding job making you closterphobic with most of the film taking place in a camper. It takes place during our time, the cell phones showing us that. Let's just hope that Alexandre remakes more of Wes Cravens films because he sure does a hell of a job at it. I HIGHLY recommend this film to any horror movie goer, of just any movie buff at all. Excellent! 10/10",10,1,3,29 April 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," the best action film of ALL time
","this and 2 fast 2 furious are the only films to surpass their original, that i know of. this is just a awesome movie, action packed, and james cameron's best film ever. edward furlong gives his best performance along with arnold schwarzenegger and linda hamilton. it is about a cyborg sent back from the future to kill edward furlong because he is to be this great war leader when he grows up. then arnold, the protector is sent, and it is a matter of who gets to him first. this is by far the best action film of all time, right there with the matrix and bad boys 2. so just sit back and watch this film and prepare to be amazed. great movie, 10/10",10,9,13,19 May 2006
The Usual Suspects," Outstanding Thriller!
","this is by far one of the best thrillers i have ever seen! If u like saw, saw2 or the sixth sense, u should love this! You think you have it all figured out until the end... i loved it.. 10/10. Kevin Spacey does a marvelous job acting his role. I never have been a fan of the bawldwins, but loved Stephen Bawldwin in this movie. Although..... the movie is very complicated and at sometimes hard to follow..... to any movie lover, you should love it. A excellent first movie for director Brian Singer. It is wonderfully acted. Wonderfully directed, and the ending is just plain outstanding. Definitely in my top 10 favorite movies. If you have the slightest idea about wanting to rent it, rent it. If you want to buy it, BUY IT!",10,0,1,29 April 2006
Batman Begins," awesome
","i prefer the tim burton versions of batman, but this was just as good. Action packed from beginning to end and just a awesome movie. Christopher Nolan redeems himself with his great directing and professional screenplay writing. Christian Bale is the second best batman, Mikael Keaton first, and does a really good job. if u liked any of the batman films, check this one out, it is great. cool gadgets, awesome car, great acting, superb directing, and i have to say, finally, besides Tim Burton's work, a on the edge of your seat- action packed film! i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who liked the other batman films. 9/10",9,1,2,20 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," despite what you may think
","May Contain Spoilers! this was awesome. and out of all of the other people here who say it's bad, i have no idea where they are getting it from. although i HIGHLY prefer the second X-Men better because Bryan Singer is just a awesome director, Brett Ratner did a very great job as well. and i have a very important message to those who do see this, WATCH THE MOVIE EVEN AFTER THE CREDITS!!!!! it is SO important to do so. i did really enjoy this movie i just felt there wasn't as much action as the first and second one's. a lot of critics say Brett Ratner couldn't direct this one because he does movies like the family man, rush hour, rush hour 2 and red dragon which are all good. Bryan Singer did the usual suspects, x-man, x2 and the new superman which are all awesome so some people are going to think Bryan would do a better job, which i am unsure about. Anyways i highly recommend this film to anyone it is very good. 9/10",9,0,1,29 May 2006
Big Fish," my all time favorite movie
","i have always enjoyed Tim Burton's masterpieces. Such as Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Batman Returns, Ed Wood, The Nightmare Before Christmas. But this is by far his most excellent film. It really captures both Daniel Wallaces and Tim Burton's wonderful imagination is this outstanding tale. If you have never have the pleasure of seeing this film, do so. I loved this movie, and have yet to find one that has been better. And i don't expect Tim Burton to do anymore wonderful than he has done with this film, which is one of the best movies i think, EVER MADE. With great acting perforemances by Billy Crudup, Alfred Molina, Ewan McGregor and Hellena Bonham Carter, this is a true diamond in the rough of a film. 10/10",10,0,4,29 April 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," outstanding
","Contains spoilers! now this is a GREAT film. its original, great acting and superv directing. i had no trouble at all following this film, although it can be confusing. this is one of the only films i can watch over and over. i think this might be the best love story ever told. it's very sad, and just plain remarkable....it starts with Joel Barish, (Jim Carrey), waking up one monring on his way to work. he keeps a journal in which he writes all of his thoughts, ideas, and draws pictures. he realizes that he has ripped out pages and see's that he hasn't written in two years. at a resteraunt, he see's clementide kerchynski, or whatever, and they begin talking.after talking and having a serious relationship, Joel goes and talks to her. she acts like she doesn't even know him. It turns out Clementide erased Joel from her mind. So to forget about all this, Joel does it too. Joel has to get rid of anything, movies, clothes, pictures, presents, whatever, so there isn't a unexplainable presence in their homes. Well, while erasing the memories of her, Joel experiences the memories, and thinks the memories are too important and he loves them too much, so he tries calling the process off. this movie is just amazing. One of Jim Carrey's best performances. 10/10",10,0,2,30 April 2006
Saw," one of the best films i ever 'saw'
","Spoilers!!!! from James Wan and Leigh Whannel, comes a unbeleiveable psychological thriller about 2 men chained to pipes in a old abandoned bathroom. The killer, 'Jigsaw', puts people in situations to kill themselves because he feels they do not appreciate life. I must say Jigsaw is brilliant, but STILL A KILLER. TO me, this is better than the 2nd, yet the sequel is also outstanding. This movie all ties in, leaving you knowing exactly what's going on and what is happening. Not like those horrible thrillers to where you don't know what is going on. Beautifully directed, and edited, and pretty impressing acting, this is one film that will forever be in my collection. If you are to buy it, get the uncut edition, it's awesome. 10/10",10,0,1,29 April 2006
Inside Man," very disappointing
","careful!!! contains spoilers! this film has to be one of the films i was looking forward to the most. i had a chance to see either this, or V for vendetta. should have seen one of them. Spike Lee does a good job directing, i just think it's the writing. at the beginning it shows the main actor in what you think is a jail cell, but turns out to be something very different. other than all that,i don't recommend this movie to anyone. it's just another movie that could have been so much better, but wasn't good at all. Clive Owen does a good job directing, once again, it's just the writing. It's very hard to follow, complicated, and at some parts, highly funny. but, it's just plain bad. I'm sorry spike, u disappointed me! 5/10",5,1,4,29 April 2006
Detroit Rock City," loved it
","now this is a hilarious film that reminds me of how some people i know are. seems like a really low budget film, but is the best low budget comedy ever! all the characters are hilarious in their own way, and the bathroom scene is so funny your gonna hold your stomach while laughing. probably the only film i could watch religiously for a year. the music is great, and it's well directed. if you love comedies like bad santa, ace ventura 1 and 2, i HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone. Although it does lack a certain element that most comedies have, it's still a great one. Way better than that stupid animal house, A lot BETTER.May contain spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's about 4 kids who are dying to go to a kiss concert, and jam, one of the kids's mom, burns the tickets, so they figure that's not gonna stop them, they keep going after Trip win's a radio contest.... this is highly funny as they encounter random events and strange people.. i loved it! 10/10",10,1,3,30 April 2006
Titanic," Beautiful film
","James Cameron is always to impress...and that is why I'm going to say this film is his second best, terminator 2 being #1. It's a good story, great acting by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. Professional Directing, just basically one of the best films ever. It deserves every bit of it's box office total. Even though i am a boy, i balled my eyes out at the end of this movie. It was a wonder to see in the movie theater, and is just as good with it's 3 disc, digitally enhanced DVD collection, which i own. So, if u have not seen this film, i HIGHLY advise you to do so. It takes all the elements of Sound, Picture, Acting, Directing, Editing all it it's highest, and creates a monumental film that should be FOREVER remembered. 20/10!",10,0,2,29 April 2006
Ray," outstanding!
","possibly the best film ever created. Taylor Hackford couldn't have done a better job directing this masterpiece. Jamie Fox also does a award winning performance as Ray Charles. The ending had me in tears, and still, a great movie. It is quite lengthy, but well worth the time and money. Along with Titanic, King Kong, Terminator 2 and the 10th kingdom, it's one of the only LONG movies i could watch over and over again and not get tired of it, still loving it. It does end at a surprising point in his life, but ended at the PERFECT time. This is also a outstanding documentary- drama that i wish i could have seen in the theater. Excellent! 10/10",10,0,2,30 April 2006
X2: X-Men United," just amazing
","i loved Bryan Singers movies since The Usual Suspects. But man this was just way too good for words. Unbelievable effects, speechless directing, very good acting, everything was perfect. seeing the first and third, i prefer this to them all. there is no way it could have been better. even though my favorite 'super- hero' movie is batman returns i almost like this better. i was lucky enough to squeeze into the theatre to see this one and it was a delite. it shines along with the comic books and the first film. one of the onlys to serpast the first one. so i HIGHLY recommend this one to any move buff or X-Men fan. i loved this one. 10/10 good job Bryan!",10,0,0,29 May 2006
The Sixth Sense," Best Thriller Ever Made
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! this is the best thriller ever made. outstanding job by m night for writing and directing this outstanding film. the foreshadowing is awesome, and right at the end, BAM! a ending that is so WELL DONE. M Night is always to impress with the village, signs and unbreakable, and soon to be The Lady In The Water. This will always be Bruce WIllis's best film. And let's not leave out Haley Joel Osment. WOW! Great Acting. Haley and Bruce Willis basically are what makes this 2 hour movie such a bliss to watch. it will always be the best thriller ever made. right there with the usual suspects, saw, saw 2, cry wolf. 10/10",10,0,0,29 April 2006
Fantastic Four," what a waste of time
","and no, the thing doesn't rock! this movie was Horrible. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS. it has horrible acting, pretty bad special effects, stupid screenplay, all the elements to make a bad movie which this is. the only thing decent about it was Jessica alba. i cannot believe Tim Story went from a classic comedy like barbershop to this piece of crap. spider-man, batman and x-men are almost all put down by this. just watch either them or the punisher, because that is AWESOME. i highly DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone. if u love movies, stay away from this. it's a put down to both the comic books and all super hero movies. i hated it! 1/10",1,1,2,25 May 2006
