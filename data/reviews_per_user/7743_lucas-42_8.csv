Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'It's not the years honey, it's the mileage.'
","I love Harrison Ford movies, but this is the BEST movie I believe I have ever seen.  True, I love Star Wars too, but I saw this movie BEFORE I ever saw Star Wars, and it has found a special place in my heart.In all my years of viewing movies, I have yet to find another movie with quite as much style as this.  Everything was done so well.  Putting together a terrific heroic score like John Williams did with the 'Raiders March' is only something that happens once in a lifetime.  That score will always make me feel the need for adventure.  It just gets you going, and makes you excited, helps you get into the movie.Oh, and the little things that just make it so amazingly clever.  Such as the scene where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is confronted by a thug with a big sword.  The thug shows off his swordsmanship as to intimidate Indy, but Indy just draws his weapon as casual as you possibly could and shoots the thug with his pistol.  That's incredible.  Done very well!Oh, or how about the famous scene where they open up the seal to the Well of the Souls and Indy just comments, 'Snakes, why'd it have to be snakes?''Movie magic' is a term described when talking about the special effects in a film, but for this movie, I'd use it to describe how Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford all came together to make an adventure movie that will surely stand the test of time.",10,0,0,25 November 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The most fun you can have at the movies without making out
","That's right.  This movie is pure fun.  No, it isn't the best or worst movie of all time ever.  But guess what?  It's entertaining, captures the spirit of the ride and a swashbuckling adventure with some awesome special effects, great acting and a script that doesn't even take itself seriously leading to some very very funny moments.Mr. Depp, great job.  We wouldn't have such a good movie without ye.  I laughed, I cried and... I got confused for a second at one of the quickly said jokes and then figured it out and laughed some more.Fun fun fun.. what a good movie this is.  Best movie of the year.  If you don't think so.  Oh well.  Guess you lack what makes life truly fun.  If you liked it but don't think it's the best of the year.  I agree.  I changed my mind.  Just the best movie of the summer.  STILL, go watch it!  you'll like it! ... I didn't use one stupid, corny pirate-related joke at all in that review.  Aren't you proud?'and really bad eggs'",10,1,3,16 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Prequel is Back with the 'Attack' - The Force is DEFINITELY a lot Stronger this time!
","Talk about popcorn entertainment!  Ok, I know your all wondering if this new prequel sequel brings back some of the 'ol Star Wars magic to the big screen.  Well, happily, the answer is definitely Yes!  This movie IS a good movie.  It's not the greatest Star Wars film ever, but it certainly isn't the worst.  It ranks as one of the best though!The opening credits crawling across the screen seemed kind of odd.  It felt weird to be at a Star Wars movie again.  But, still, the feeling was great. I admit that I had not really been too excited about EPII up until the last few weeks.  I had easily avoided spoilers and etc. online due to a lack of interest in Star Wars after the dreadful (but still a kick-ass lightsaber duel'n flick) Episode I.Attack of the Clones has waaay more action in it, and the CGI special FX are top-notch.  Ten times that of TPM.  You'll find yourself immersed in the Star Wars universe much more than that of any previous Star Wars film.  I don't care what anybody says.  The locations seem so much more real this time around, so vast, so large.  You'll visit places you've never been... like Genosis.  But this time without showing you EVERY little detail that is happening within the environment.The acting, despite what some may say, isn't all that bad.  Albeit you'll forget all about the 'acting' when watching it anyway.  I wasn't really dissapointed at all.  I think there are just some REALLY over-sensitive critics out there whining about Episode II.  Oh, and by the way, the story is MUCH better and a lot more interesting this time around.Anakin is kinda whiney in this movie, but tortured/confused whiney.. sort of reminding you of Luke Skywalker.. but also showing you a darker and much more evil side that's begging to come out.  Thankfully, Jar Jar's role is small.  Smaller than I thought.  He hardly speaks at all and is only on screen for a tiny amount of time.  Don't let the gungan get-to-ya.  Some of my friends were STILL bothered that he was just there.  Bah!  Get over it!Obi-Wan is the true star of this movie.  Obviously Mr. McGregor did something right.. because it just seemed so right for him to be playing this character this time around.  Obi sees a lot more action than before, though his lightsaber duel at the end is nothing like the one before.  But something else about that scene will make up for it!The dialogue in the movie wasn't bad at all.  Well, at least in any scene other than the love scenes with.. well... you know who!  Some clever dialogue along the lines of 'Anakin, I feel you'll be the death of me' made this movie even better.  Talk about fore-shadowing!And...... Yoda.  He is the only character in the movie that got applause and a standing ovation, no to mention some un-intentional laughter.  People were shouting as soon as the Yoda's-gonna-kick-some-*** scene popped up on screen.  I won't spoil it for you, but you'll be happy that you paid for that ticket after you see the scene.  It's AWESOME!!  It's worth seeing in theaters twice!  You'll love it!Anyway, this movie (unlike it's younger prequel counterpart) is so enjoyable it will make you laugh, excited, worried and very entertained all throughout.  It's not a perfect movie, it's not a bad movie either.  It's a really great - Ahem! - GREAT Star Wars movie!  Go see it now.  Trust me, the force will be with you.",6,1,1,16 May 2002
Spider-Man," All the Wonderful Wall-Crawling Action You've come to Expect!
","This movie I have now seen twice.  Rarely, if ever, does a movie become more than just a movie.  Seldom do I walk out of the theater, smiling, with only one other thought on my mind.. 'I wanna do that again!'  Yup, this movie is definitely that.  I'll be honest to you all.  The movie is not PERFECT, but it IS perfectly entertaining.  You'll see what I mean after you've sat through this flick.  True, some of the CGI special-fx are not as realistic as you would expect from a film given a budget over $100,000,000.  But, they are good enough to convincingly tell a really good story.  No, scratch that last remark.  A really GREAT story!Spider-Man is one of those movies that you'll remember long after you've taken those final steps out of the local theater.  I found it funny at times, heartwarming at others, and action-packed when it needed to be. Tobey is the perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman because, well, he just is.  He convinces us that he's an outcasted dork who has his eyes sat upon the seemingly un-reachable MJ, who suddenly is overwhelmed with new powers and responsiblities.  He does a good job of playing Spidey.  From the sharp-wit to the honest nature of Peter Parker.  He pulls it off nicely.William Dafoe does one of the most convincing Jekyll/Hyde scenes you may ever see in your life.  He's talking to his alter-personality, the Green Goblin, in a mirror.. switching back and forth between Norman Osborn and 'ol Gobbie.  It's shocking how much scarier Mr. Dafoe can look WITHOUT the Goblin mask.  In fact, I think he could have pulled of the Goblin with just a little bit of green makeup.  Dafoe IS that good in this movie.  There are some moments where Gobbie's gonna make you laugh, trust me.  They're hilarious.The movie's story is really great, and it WILL entertain you.  For those who have a problem with the oragnic web-shooting spidey, no need to worry. It's hardly even noticeable in the film.  It really isn't a big deal.I did, however, have one complaint.  I really wish the Goblin mask would have had the ability to move the Goblin's mouth.  It just felt a little stupid looking at that big gaping hole in close-up shots.  From a distance (i.e. when flying) it doesn't look so bad though.Stick around during the credits, you'll get to hear a special surprise!!",10,0,0,14 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," One of the best film of all time.
","This is quite possibly one of the most entertaining and engrossing films I've seen in a long, long time.  Sure, other recent films have been really great... Spiderman was a great movie this past summer.  But few are so epic and big that they're grand.  This is a movie that will forever be remembered in cinema history because it contains all of the elements that make a movie stand the test of time.  Lots of movies are forgotten or merely overlooked after a few years pass, but then there are those that you always remember because of the wonderful feeling they bring you when watching them.  You know your watching one of the greats when your completely taken out of your own life, you feel like your IN the movie.  When all your troubles are not on your mind for at least a few hours.  You know it's one of the best movies you've ever seen when everything on screen looks like it is real.  Even the CGI in this movie is merged so well with real shots that you don't really think 'hey that's fake!'  That's quite an accomplishment in today's movies.Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is.. like a lot of films.. a little more interesting than it's original movie, since the plot of the film has basically already been sat in motion and we can jump right into the story and all the action.  But because the three films are really one story and not three seperate stories, like the books themselves, you can't really rate one movie over the other.  Just see it as one big story.... The Lord of the Rings.
and of course, who couldn't love this story.  I have a feeling Return of the King is going to be the better of them all.  I can't wait!  It's only a year! ;)",10,0,0,6 January 2003
Shrek 2," Magic all over again...
","Rarely do I take the time to comment on a movie here, even if I like it. I only comment if I was actually put in a really good mood by the movie because I liked it so much or if it put me in a horrible one because it's suckosity level was far too high.This movie did not have a suckosity rating at all. This movie rates a 10 on the awesmosity scale! Anyway, stupidity aside... I thought this movie was brilliant.I actually did not think from the previews that the story would be strong enough to compete with the original idea. It looked like Shrek meets, well, Meet the Parents. But really it wasn't at all. Well maybe a little.But seriously, I was extremely surprised at how well it turned out and how likable Shrek, Fiona and Donkey still are. It was truly a magical cinematic experience. No perfect movie, but none are. But this is one of the best I've ever seen... quite a wonderful movie. Far above a lot of live-action crap movies we see all the time that don't have an ounce of the magic, humor and wit found in this Shrek sequel.I loved it a lot. The movie once again warmed my heart just like the first one did. Oh yeah, and it made me laugh too. :PGood movie. Watch it.",10,1,2,29 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Marvelous
","Well, I don't usually like to take the time to comment on movies. But I must for a Star Wars film. Let's just say, Episode III gets it right, finally. As close to the originals as I think we can ever get. Although filled with some cheesy moments, like Vader's Noooo! and such, it was terrific.Personally, I found the opening space battle to be amazing... and the acting was all around better in this film. Especially with Hayden and his chemistry with Portman. McGregor's pained face during the Mustafar duel was terrific and moving... not to mention the fighting was among the best in any Star Wars film.We can't leave out the actor playing palpatine (Ian McCaig is it?) who does a terrific job. Although he WAS the emperor way back in ROTJ, so I expected as much.Everything, just about, is finally explained... including the midichlorians which now make more sense. Which returns the force back to it's spiritual and mystical roots.Personally though, even though I know it has it's flaws, it was great.I even almost cried it was so sad at the end. Those duel tatooine suns-a-set'n.*tear*",10,1,5,12 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," There Never Was a Better End
","To put it simply... 'wow.'  I could write another long review of the movie like everyone else and be lost in the sheer number of postivie things I'm sure everyone has to say.  But I'll cut it short.It's a tear jerker, it's a visual wonder... it's heartwarming and really cares about every character it has.You'll see.  I was particularly impressed by the last few visuals inside Mt. Doom, breathtakingly beautiful.  The acting was flawless and Sam shows just how brave he can be.  I loved this movie. ... one of the best stories of all time and now one of the best film trilogys as well.Hats off to Mr. Peter Jackson.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
