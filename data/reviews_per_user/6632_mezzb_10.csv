The Blair Witch Project," severe logic problems dampen otherwise fine shocker
","*** I'm sad to say The Blair Witch Project did not scare me at all.  And I really wanted to be scared too.  Part of the problem for me was that I couldn't get past a couple of very basic errors in the film.  If I did, I too could have been dragged into their world and had the bejeezus scared out of me like so many others.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very unique and effective film.  There is strong work by the actors, with only occasional groan-inducing over-acting.  And the pacing, setting, and art direction were more than adequate.  I just had some major problems getting 'into' the film because of a couple of huge logic problems I'll describe below (may be considered very slight spoilers).For one, it just seemed impossible to get that lost in the woods (in MD anyway).  To walk for days and days without seeing train tracks or an old road or a fence (of a farm or something).  It is hinted that supernatural forces are keeping them in the woods.  They even had a couple of 'How to survive in the woods' books.  Surely they would say to follow one those streams, or climb a tree on the top of the hill.  Not much of a film if they got un-lost maybe, but technically they walked about 40 hours and found nothing??!!  maybe in Alaska or Wyoming, but certainly not 60 miles outside DC.  I think a bit more creativity on the writing staff was warranted.  A slight injury to one of the party, or cut the adventure back a day or two. I've been lost in the woods - you walk till you hit the water then you follow the shore.  you don't criss cross it a billion times like an idiot.Also, the constant filming.  They made attempts to explain why ( 'It's all I have left.' - apparently her will to film was stronger than her will to survive - quite a feat indeed).  They filmed even when running for their lives.  Again, without the constant filming you get no story, but maybe there was another way out.  So there you have it: I'm one of those people who has a bit more trouble suspending disbelief than others.  So if you can suspend your disbelief, say goodbye to bejeezus, because it's going to be scared out of ya.  But if you're like me, it'll be an interesting and unique film, not without merit, but without scares.",Null,0,0,3 December 1999
Akira," Should have been tightened up at the end
","A great film that could have been among the best films ever made, Akira is hampered by it's drawn-out conclusion.  Both beautiful to look at and listen to (referring to the new sound dub on the Pioneer DVD), Akira also engages the mind and emotions.  Then its climax goes on for about 17 minutes, boring and confusing the audience.  For an hour and a half, I was spellbound, but the draggy climax turned me off.  And the very very end is one big 'HUH??!!'.  But maybe I'm just too stupid to get it.Some points: The Pioneer DVD doesn't appear to be a new cut.  The American voice actors on the new dub are good but not great.  The sound however is phenomenal. And music is far better than the usual edgy-cartoon-heavy-metal associated with the genre.  Also someone commented that you need to watch the subtitled version in order to see the movie as the makers intended. Hogwash I say!  The makers of the film intended for you to watch the film, not read it.  The Japanese version is dubbed too ya know (since cartoons can't talk yet).  I have no problem watching cartoons dubbed.  And this is a strong dub.  I flipped to the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles and found myself reading the confusing dialogue and missing out on the spectacle. it's a matter of preference.  Some folks are purists I suppose.Last point, the book is always better than the movie, except for 'Jaws'.  It goes without saying that a book/manga can go into more plot detail and character development than a 2 hour film.  That said, I found lots of places they should have actually reduced the plot of the 2000 page manga even further, to be more appropriate to a 2 hour film.  Such as: 'TIGHTEN UP THE ENDING!'I'm done - thanks (8/10 - the first 3/4 is that incredible)",Null,1,3,21 August 2001
Sleepy Hollow," why wasn't this scary?
","Tim Burton should have watched Halloween and Jaws 50 times each before attempting to make this 'horror' movie.  He has made more mediocre movies with strong visual style, than great films.  'Ed Wood' was his simplest visually and best overall film.  He's been on a slump since then, with the awful 'Mars Attacks' and the mediocre-but-could-have-been-great 'Sleepy Hollow'.  Too bad really.He fell into the CGI trap.  'Look what we can do!  IT really looks someone's head is being lopped off!  And the setting is so-o-o misty and moody!  And look at the costumes and set design - it's a visual feast!'  great.  But it's not scary.  Not at all.This movie really fell apart for me near the end, when it launched into the horribly cliched dastardly-villain-explains-the-plot bit (and I would have gotten away with it to if it weren't for you meddling kids).  Good films don't resort to this hackneyed device.",Null,1,1,26 June 2000
The Butterfly Effect," Critical Group Think
","(this refers to the director's cut DVD, which has a different ending)I am amazed by the group-think often displayed by major film critics. Mediocre, boring films get universally praised, and some tight little gems get universally panned.  'The Butterfly Effect' is an example of the latter. Here are some common complaints of the film according to the critics.<ul><li>Ashton Kutcher was horrible.  ***I think he did a fine job.  His style is very natural and believable.  And it fit the role pretty well.  He is genuinely likable too, which is a plus in a grim film as this.  Sure he's no Olivier, but it works.</li></ul><ul><li>The film is too downbeat. ***That's the idea.  The critics seem to forget however, that it was not gratuitous, even though its 'R' rating would have allowed for much more graphic imagery.  It's a grim film by design, and its tone is consistent.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot is outrageous.  ***Sure, it's not the least bit believable.  But is 'The Return of the King' believable?  'Butterfly' is a Supernatural Thriller.  It's fantasy world with its own unique rules: 1) Evan could return to a previously blacked-out event if he read the corresponding journal entry and concentrated really hard.  2) Upon entry to the past, he maintained his adult persona, and had full control of his previous self.  3) Whatever changes he made only seemed to effect himself, three childhood friends, and his mom.</li></ul>Within those rules, the film is amazingly consistent.  If you piece together Evan's 'Quantum Leaps' with its alternate present, you will notice startling fidelity to the rules.  Certainly more than other 'changing the past affects present' films like the Back to the Future series.This could have been a nice little money-maker that encouraged courageous story-telling.  But the critical panning killed its chances.",Null,0,2,5 August 2004
Insidious," 6-8 quality scares
","You want to know what's scary? Unexpectedly seeing a really scary face, and at the same time hearing a really loud musical cue. I'm being dead serious - it's jarring as heck. The makers of 'Insidious' have taken this simple premise and crafted an entire film around it. Not only do they understand the formula (scary face + loud music cue = fright), they understand how to space these jolts out over a 90 minute film so that the effect doesn't diminish. They have done this, and only this. It is enough for a 6 out of 10, because so few movies know how to actually scare you. But don't kid yourself into thinking it makes it a great, or even a good film. Without those jolts, what's left is a genuinely silly film, with an overwrought score, unlikeable leads, and some highly sad effects (ie smoke machines).",Null,1,2,31 July 2011
Unknown," 'What is known can become un-known' Friedrich Nietzsche
","(I made up the above quote by the way)This is a preposterous movie and I have never seen one more-so. It is that way by design, with the sole purpose to exasperate the viewer for much of its run-time, then wipe the confusion and anger away with late reveal. And upon learning the 'twist', the viewer is supposed to feel the relief of understanding. All well and good, but if you view the film a second time, in full knowledge of the twist, you will still be shocked at the series of outrageous events and strange coincidences that drive the premise.I just can't abide a movie, based nominally in the 'real world', that requires so much suspension of disbelief. I will close this mini-review with the most minor example: Liam Neeson explains to a scientist (paraphrasing from memory), 'When I was 10 years, I told my father I wanted to be a botanist.' That is not an example of a plot hole, because it inconsequential to the plot. But it is the least plausible sentence ever uttered on film.",Null,3,6,31 July 2011
Pi," Good, but it's been done better
","I made the mistake of seeing this movie after seeing the bone-rattling Japanese cult shocker 'Tetsuo: The Iron Man.'  They are startlingly similar but Tetsuo is clearly superior.Still, Pi is intelligent and off-beat.  I would say it's a top notch amateur picture (nothing like being damned with feint praise eh?).   I made the mistake of seeing the picture that succeeds in this type of mood setting before seeing this noble effort which comes up a few hairs sort.",Null,0,0,10 June 1999
Halloween," some thoughts on the H movie
","This is an excellent scary movie.  Those few folks who haven't seen it may have a couple of problems.  They must remember that this is the first true slasher film.  It created all the clich√©s so it can be forgiven for its miscues.For example on more than one occasion, Jamie Lee Curtis' character wounds the killer and instead of running from the house, she drops her weapon and curls up into a ball a few feet from the stunned attacker.  This creates great tension but is fairly asinine.Also there is a singularly gratuitous nude scene (oops I spilled butter on my clothes, I better strip to my panties this instant).All in all, this is a film oozing with classic scares in a genre gone horror-comedy.  It should be a reminder that gore has nothing to do with scares.",Null,0,0,3 February 2000
The Matrix," Don't be fooled
","The hype from this movie was huge.  From its surprisingly huge box office to internet fan sites, to constant gushing by friends and relatives, I thought this was a can't-miss.  For me, it missed.1. They give away the essential secret/premise very early on (there are other revelations of course, but the whole matrix thing gets exposed very early).  I thought it would've worked better to keep it mysterious to bouy the next complaint.2. It dragged in the middle.  Big time.  Practically nothing happens.  no tension.   nothing.  A bunch of dialog explaining 'the rules'.  If they held onto the mystery a little longer, that could have kept this dead part a bit more interesting.  During this 70 minute dead spot, all I could think of was how I had to go to the bathroom.3. Even with all that explaining, it still gets a little confusing, and there were many questions to be asked of the writer, along the lines of 'Why didn't they just <insert more logical action here> instead of <doing what they actually did>?'  The answer was 'To serve the story, not logic.'4. The last 20-30 minutes of this movie really rock.  I think this explains why so many are ga-ga over this film.  It just rips out of its sleepy middle and smokes right through to the credits.  I (and many others) liked Episode One for the same reason - it leaves you breathless, forgetting that most of the movie was pretty tired.But the difference between ep one and this (and why I liked ep one better) is they broke up the middle with a pod race.  Here there's nothing like that.",Null,0,0,27 September 1999
The Birds," He's done better
","I think Mr. Hitchcock concentrated a bit too much on his experiments and too little on actual scares.  The choice to have no musical score was daring, but the inclusion of subtle musical cues would have only benefited the often flat suspense scenes.  The choice to have the movie end before real resolution did not I feel have the desired effect.  I understand what he was trying to do, but it felt more like they ran out of money or time and said, 'Why don't we just end it here.'  And the other guy says, 'Works for me. Bye.'The other really annoying thing is that Tippi Hedron's character behaves in such an incredibly foolish manner near the end of the movie (spoilers until the end of this paragraph).  A. Why did she refuse to wake up Mitch, who'd been the absolute hero of the whole scenario and saved her butt a couple of times already, before going up the stairs.  B. Is her reaction upon seeing the birds in the attic realistic? She manages to lock ***herself*** in the room with the birds.  Pretty lame.  You can't chalk it up to shock because she'd been attacked by birds about 7 times that day already.  She should have been bird-savvy by then.  C. It's impossible to believe she had no chance to open the door behind her.  Impossible.  One more thing.  D.  I would have left that wacky maniac-bird infested town long before they went back to the house.  And E. Why did so many people consciously choose to go outside when the birds attacked.  I'll stop here, but I could continue right through ZZ.All these gripes aside, it's still a decent movie.  The acting is pretty good.  And Hitchcock as usual gave us some 3 (or 2.5) dimensional characters to latch onto and a decent story before bringing the maniac birds on the scene.  It always helps when you care about the characters.  (note to modern genre directors: characters and story are what drive films, not special effects and cheap thrills.  Put together a movie with strong characters, strong story, then add the cheap thrills and effects; now you have good movie.)  And the attacking bird scenes were pretty effective and not as cheesey as you might think for a movie made in the early sixties.Two and a half stars (out of four).Take care, Mike",Null,0,1,27 October 1999
