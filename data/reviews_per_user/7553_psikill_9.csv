Requiem for a Dream," This Film Is Probably The Best Campaign Against Drugs...
","`Requiem For A Dream' is a realistic film about drugs, what they can do to a person, and how they destroy their lives, their dreams, their plans, everything. Darren Aronofsky does an excellent work, surely his best until now. And, `Requiem' is probably the best of its genre, and the most realistic I've ever seen. It tells the story of four lives, each with their own addictions to drugs, and how they start to go down the drain as the months passes and as the story progresses.Spoilers `Requiem For A Dream' is a simple story. It involves the lives of four people, Harold (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connely), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Mrs. Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harold's mother. As the story starts, Aronofsky introduces us to the characters, what are they addictions, their daily behavior, how they interact with people, their dreams, aspirations, etc. Harold and Tyrone are partners in the drug business, and they start doing business on the streets, consequently the money comes rolling in. They consume it, they sell it, and they buy it. Meanwhile, Mrs. Goldfarb receives a call, a call that says that she is soon to be appearing on her favorite TV show. She thinks the call is a prank call, to cheat her, but, with full of hope and simplicity, she decides to trust in the person on the other side of the line. As the opportunity to appear in a TV program becomes more real, she decides to get thinner, entering also, in a world of drugs. A different kind of drugs, but one as dangerous as the ones her son, Harold, was consuming. As the months pass, passing from Summer to Winter, their state of mind and physical appearance start to decrease. The addiction to drugs starts to increase. The number of drugs in the city is constantly decreasing. This factor takes Tyrone and Harold to Philadelphia to buy some new drugs, but as they arrive there, they don't expect what's waiting for them. Marion is the most addicted, she can't live without drugs. She decides to get drugs through other means. Mrs. Goldfarb starts to get annoyed by the fact that the TV program doesn't get back to her, and eventually her mind starts getting tired. The consequences of these actions and behavior are the most realistic and spine-chilling I've ever seen. End of Spoilers`Requiem' is marked, mainly, by its morbid direction. Darren Aronofsky has done a fantastic job. He uses quick shots to represent the use of drugs, to demonstrate how the drugs affect the brain: it's quick. The visuals of the film are absolutely spectacular. I've never seen nothing like that. I had already seen `Pi', and the direction of it isn't much different than `Requiem', but, either way, I was absolutely astonished. The acting is very realistic, specially Ellen Burstyn's. I know many people have said this, but it doesn't hurt saying it again: best performance since `The Exorcist', she should have won the Oscar, surely. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely are perfect, portraying the teen couple, who are deeply in love, but unfortunately, are addicted to drugs. Marlon Wayans has his best performance of all time as Tyrone C. Love(jumps from `Scary Movie' to the best film he has ever done). The plot is very absorbing and, without a doubt, thought-provoking. Along with the direction, the score by Clint Mansell cooperating with The   , is one of the best in the movie industry. It was as absorbing as the plot. Absolutely magnificent. Great soundtrack.Finally, `Requiem For A Dream' is the best film I've ever seen about drugs, and the most realistic. After seeing this one, you'll see the world of drugs with another perspective. Either you'll like it, or you won't. Are you the kind of person that accepts reality as it is, or, are you the kind of person that just wants to ignore it? One thing's for sure, it will definitely raise in you quite a number of moral issues.PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10",9,1,2,7 April 2004
Memento," Caught in the middle of a nightmare...
","Have you ever taught of losing your memory and realizing that your wife is dead? That is the problem with Leonard, he doesn´t have the ability to remember recent things that happened to him. He has the desire of finding the murderer of his wife and kill him, as the story goes back in time, leaving us to make sudden conclusions and know a little more about what happened really. Great technique used by Christopher Nolan.Along with 'Betrayal', this is one of the films that goes back in time, but totally different stories, although I have to say that 'Memento' sounds better, has better acting (sorry Ben Kingsley) and better direction. Also better organization of the events occurred.This is a great film, smartly made and requires constant attention, which captured me right from the beginning, though sometimes, in the middle of the movie, it can be a bit ambiguous and boring. Apart from that it´s absolutely perfect, and I recommend it to anyone who likes good films.9 out of 10",10,0,3,30 June 2003
12 Monkeys," Terry Gilliam's Vision of Time Travel
","Terry Gilliam succeeds, once again, in making a film full of colorful figures, tight angles and close shots, making it interesting along the away. I must say that I loved many of other Gilliam's films, like `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' or `The Fisher King' and I was very anxious to see `Twelve Monkeys'. The story is centered mainly in time-travel experience, and how that can be malicious to somebody's life and to his/her surroundings.Spoilers: The story begins in a near future, when a convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is chosen to travel back in time in order to stop the evil army of The Twelve Monkeys. In fact, in the future that the film sets place in, people live under the ground, because there was a lethal virus, released by this army, that destroyed almost the entire population of the Earth, and the survivors decided to hide under the ground, letting the animals rule Earth again. Cole gets sent to the wrong year, being immediately sent to a mental institution where he meats Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a crazy patient of the hospital. Terry Gilliam involves us in the story, developing a sense of hope in the viewer, making him have compassion for the cause that Brad Pitt's character fights for, and also develops a romance between Cole and Railly. Finally the story ends, where the director gives his personal touch about what time travel is, after all, about, adding a little bit of irony, tragedy and at the same time, hope... and he does it so well. End of Spoilers.`12 Monkeys' is marked, without a doubt, by its direction. It happened in other Terry Gilliam's films. He develops the film with his traditional close shots and tight angles with his camera. The acting, I must say, was pretty good, especially Brad Pitt. In fact, I think this was his film of affirmation in the Hollywood community (this was before Se7en) as an actor. Bruce Willis led a steady performance, alongside Madeleine Stowe, who, in my opinion, had better days. The plot isn't that complicated to follow, actually it's very linear with no significant twists and thought provoking acts. (Well come to think of it, time travel is a really serious topic).Overall, `Twelve Monkeys' is an entertaining film, that almost keeps you in the edge of your seat. Some disappointing and boring parts, others very extraordinary in terms of film making and also very exciting, but nothing out of the ordinary. This isn't really Gilliam's best, nevertheless I recommend it.PsIKiLL's Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,1 April 2004
Predator," Horror and action in the same movie...
","One of the most original films ever made, the idea of the invisible camouflage that the Predator uses is unique and well done. Good special effects for a movie from the 80´s.**##SPOILER AHEAD!##** Along with The Terminator, this is Arnold´s best action movie. He portrays Dutch, a leader of a special rescue team. John McTiernan actually succeeds at making the forest a really claustrophobic place, increasing the sensation of suspense and fear. As the victims go one by one, the feeling of 'death around the corner' increases more and more. Best line in this movie: 'If it bleeds... we can kill it!' Sincerely I was expecting more from the ending, but overall a good movie. The best character in the movie IS the Predator. Some gory images in this one, specially that scene where the Predator takes the skull from a soldier. **##END OF SPOILER##**Good Sci-fi movie, deserves a 9 out of 10",9,0,0,27 June 2003
The Usual Suspects," If you´re a lover of great endings... then you have to see this one!
","If you talk about great films, you surely have to include this one, as one of the most original and intelligent endings ever made. But of course this movie doesn´t resume only to the ending.Five men. Five criminals. One man. Keyser Soze. Who is he? No one knows. After being arrested by the police, these five man decide to cooperate with each other to gain some money. From here on, strange things will star to happen, as one man decide to hire them.We can compare it to 'Snatch', but if we're talking about twisted endings, 'Jacob´s Ladder' and 'Primal Fear' can match up this masterpiece.Great Film. Great Direction. Great Acting. Great Ending. With these four ingredients you make a movie that goes down in history. Singer plays with the spectator's mind until the very ending, when all is explained and concluded. Great performances, especially by Spacey.8 out of 10",8,0,1,3 July 2003
Pi," Finding life through numbers...
","Pi can be resumed in a very simple word: 'Obsession'. Who could have taught to do such an interesting film about numbers? I mean... my feelings about numbers have really changed once I saw this movie. Who could have taught that our world, where we live, can be represented by numbers?**##SPOILER DOWN-AHEAD##** Pi tells the story of a man... a man trying really hard to find a pattern for the stock market. Through the process he finds a number, a 216 digit number. Later he realizes that that number represents God´s true name. A band of jews and some Wall street pricks go after him, so they can have it. The brain part is quite interesting, though there were some scenes that I didn´t quite understand. **##END OF SPOILER##**Pi is a great film. For the lovers of mathematic and numbers, this is for you. Great use of the Black and White, specially in the subway scenes. Caused me a headache.10 out of 10",9,1,3,28 June 2003
Mulholland Drive," Sometimes it's better not to dream...
","Mulholland Drive, a film by David Lynch which was made to play with the viewer mind and let him make his owns conclusions about the story. I now I had many ideas of what the movie talked about, until I heard other people opinions.Spoiler: Some disturbing images, as the monster that haunts the guy from the restaurant and the rotting corpse in room 17. Well made make-up. I didn't liked the acting, it seem a little flawless, though Naomi Watts tried her best. I think she was better in 'The Ring'. Laura Harring was mediocre, the only thing I appreciated in her was her beauty. One thing about Watts and Harding was the fact that they had the courage to do that lesbian scene, but that comes with the job. Justin Theroux starred as the director who became broke, so to speak.Lynch alternated the time course of the movie, which made people a little bit confused. He said that the movie makes sense, that the clues are there to see. I know now what he meant. I guess Lynch just wanted to test the mind of the viewer. After you see it sometimes it will all become clear.Like 'Jacob's Ladder', at first it doesn't make sense, requiring multiple viewings, and I think it has a little bit of 'Memento' too, as it goes back in time. The only of it's kind in 2001, Mulholland Drive is a jolting experience that will stay on your mind until you discover it's true meaning.9 out of 10.",9,1,2,8 July 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the three films who won the main 5 Oscars
","In spite of being old, this film will surely capture your attention from the beginning. Situated in a mental institution, a new patient is brought in, R.P.McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who will change things around there. Mrs. Ratched (Louise Flecther) is the sadistic and cold nurse, who takes care of the patients. The clash between the two will promptly start. Directed by Milos Forman (Man on the Moon, Amadeus), the film also stars William Redfield as the interesting Mr Harding, Danny DeVito as Martini and Christopher Lloyd as the angry patient Taber.**##LITTLE SPOYLER DOWN HERE##** Jack Nicholson gives his best in this movie, specially in the scene where he plays cards with other patients, or when he pretends to be watching a baseball match. There is a funny part where Danny DeVito is literally dancing in the basketball court. The ending of the film is truly a classic and dramatic (a little bit shocking too), but a great ending for a great movie. **##END OF SPOILER##**Stunning performances from both Jack Nicholson (The Shining, Chinatown) and Louise Fletcher (The Exorcist II), allows this movie to be a classic. Along with 'It Happened one night' and 'Silence of the Lambs' this movie received the main 5 Oscars: Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Picture and Best Screenplay. This is an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended.10 out of 10",10,1,2,25 June 2003
True Romance," Ain't This A True Romance?
","Tony Scott has made his most interesting and linear vision of romance, directing this film. In fact, 'True Romance' is almost a unique film, as it combines romance with action and drama, and it does it so well. Few are the films that have succeeded in doing this. The film centers in the dangerous and risky romance of Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette), as they fight against drug dealers, mafia thugs, cops and pimps.Spoilers:It all begins with a present from Clarence's boss, which consists in spending a lovely and sexual-appetizer night, with a prostitute named Alabama. Little did he know, that she has a problem that makes her like only one man, and immediately falls in love with Clarence. With the relationship moving forward, they face many problems. Clarence has to wipe-out Alabama's pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), in a superb cameo performance, which only brings more problems, as they steal Drexl's drugs (without knowing of course! They're not drug addicts, as far as I know). Drugs, which had the mafia as its destination. They then try to sell it, so they can make some money, bu little did they know, that the final showdown they would be involved in, would be one of the most violent endings of the movie industry. (You would expect no less, when we're in the presence of a Tarantino story).End of SpoilersThe plot is pretty straight-forward, with no complex stuff, just plain simple and good. It is funny, violent, dizzy and sexy. Slater's performance is just enough for his role, and I thought Patricia Arquette was lovely and at the same time innocent and sexy. The rest of the cast is almost cameo performances, Val Kilmer portrays Clarence's inspiration (Elvis), Dennis Hopper (best performance of the lot) stars as Clarence's dad, James Gandolfini also makes a vintage performance. Brad Pitt stars as a drug addict (pretty funny guy), and another superb performance by Christopher Walken. In fact, the most fantastic scene in terms of acting was the part between Walken vs Hopper. True acting that part, and the music that supported it, made it more marking.Overall, I truly recommend 'True Romance'. Watch out for the ending, it is a beauty in terms of realistic violence. Maybe this film will stay on your mind, maybe it won't, but one thing's for sure, it will surely make you love even more your wife/girlfriend.PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10",9,1,3,11 March 2004
