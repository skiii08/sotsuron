Hereditary," If you hated the Witch you will hate this!
",I have NO idea how in the heck this got a 7.4?! It was so slow moving. Due to the rating my husband and I hung in there. We were waiting for something to happen. Un the naked people what was that even about? Yes Toni was great she basically carried this movie. Orher than that I cannot see what the big deal was with it. We are very disappointed would love the last two hours back please. We are early forties for those wondering. Ugh.... sad it was such a horrible movie.,3,1,3,8 September 2018
Bird Box," Well written, Bullock amazing, must see movie!
",This was an excellent drama-horror. It was unlike anything we have seen. All the actors were excellent. It had a very believable story line. Nothing was boring or drawn out. Definitely need more creative movies like this. Must see!,9,1,3,23 December 2018
Magic Mike XXL," Um ya where is Magic Mike??
","The first Magic Mike I watched in our movie room with my girlfriends. I think we all were completely in awe and more than turned on with the first movie. It was more than hot, exciting and definitely what us women wanted and have been waiting for all this time. There was an actual plot in this movie unlike what we assumed there would be none. I really enjoyed the movie, the men, the plot and movie was great. Now this movie have completely lost everything. I actually tried watching it several times, the first and second time I really fell asleep which should absolutely never happen with Magic Mike. Basically the last ten minutes is the only time you see Magic Mike or Channing dancing and taking it off. Hello isn't that why we are watching this movie? Ya not impressed.",5,0,0,30 April 2016
La La Land," If you love musicals and drama, a bit drawn out
","So I am not a musical movie person. My friend really wanted to see it. My parents had us watch Sound of Music as kids and it was constant! I think that sadly scarred me for life. I do still like that movie just haven't watched it since then! So the first part was cheesy and lots of musical parts so I wasn't a fan. The second part was much better almost zero musical parts. Overall it was a cute romantic sweet movie. There is the F word once in it by Gosling, a few other words as well, heads up for any families watching it. I would assume mostly women are the audience for this type of movie. I feel like the second half was a bit drawn out. If you love musicals and romance I can see why it received the ratings it has.",6,4,8,14 January 2017
