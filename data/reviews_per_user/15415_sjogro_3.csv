The Blair Witch Project," hype
","First of all this wasn't the first horror movie that consists out of 'found film material'. This idea was earlier brought by Ruggero Deodato in his film 'Cannibal Holocaust'. The movie is pretty slow and uninteresting in the first half, the second half however comes up with some great suspense. The scenes in the forest can be really frightening. Too bad the end-scene was so predictable.",1,0,2,5 April 2000
Shaun of the Dead," making fun of the dead
","i had been looking forward to see this, though i had mixed feelings about it. when i saw the trailer i didn't really know what to think, but now i've seen the movie i do: it's brilliant! pure entertainment, a good laugh with much respect to the horror genre! a cute and well brought fun storyline and a very well paced zombie slasher in one. that's an amazing achievement! i hadn't seen any of the actors before, except Bill Nighy. but they all play their characters really well. the soundtrack and often fast paced montage sure adds up to the enjoyment of this film. last week i saw Dawn of the Dead (the new version) which i really enjoyed for the new styletreat and changes in the storyline. this film (shaun...) however feels much better on the comedy side and still brings a great homage to the zombie genre. if you haven't already; go and see it yourselves, it's well worth the time and money!",8,0,1,18 May 2004
Cube," brilliant
","this is a brilliant movie. it just keeps you watching till the end. once you press 'play', there's no other way than just watch the whole movie.. fascinating. 'fear, paranoia,..' all that's on the cover is true. a very promising debut-film. the acting isn't all that great in some parts, but the suspense makes up for that.",9,0,1,5 April 2000
