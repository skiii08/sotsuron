Requiem for a Dream," This film is like a train at full speed hitting everybody in its way
","I was in two minds whether to watch this film or nor, as I don't quite like the drug based films, but I'm glad that I did. There are four characters,out of three are young- Harry, Marion & Ty. The fourth character is Sara Goldfarb, who is Harry's mother, and I have to say the one who gives the very good performance.Harry & Ty are Heroin addicts, and so is Harry's girlfriend Marion. Harry wants to score big one day and open a boutique for his girlfriend, but things get so messed up, that they end up being nothing but miserable. Jennifer Connelly puts the performance of her lifetime in this movie and rightfully so. In the beginning the addictions seem very harmless, but as the film progresses the truth starts to come down on them in an excruciating austerity. The final 30 minutes of the movie are unforgettable. There is nothing that brings happiness to us throughout the movie.This film is not for everyone, you are not supposed to enjoy this, but to learn out of it. No goofy comedy, no humor in it. It is like someone is hitting you in the back of you head.This is one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent work done by all the actors and the director. Some things may look exaggerated, but may be plausible. So, I give 10/10 to this movie, and , I recommend to watch this movie, reiterating that it is not for everybody.",10,0,2,12 September 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," Something unimaginable
","I saw this film with no particular expectation. I started watching this movie, kind of looked ordinary, but as the film progressed, it started to intrigue me.I wouldn't tell anything about the story. It is better if you view it without knowing any prior idea about the story. It is not a movie with suspense. But the denouement of the film is unparalleled, something unimaginable.I would consider this as one of the best films I've ever seen. The main character of this film(a detective)after retirement, decides to write a book on the case which remained unsolved. As he starts to write the book, he starts the delving into that case as well. I wouldn't tell much.This is a movie which I highly recommend to everyone, as the end will startle you, as you may not have imagined of any such thing to happen.",9,2,3,31 October 2011
The White Ribbon," A glimpse of upcoming nurtured Fascism before World War I
","A special thing about this movie is the entire movie was shot in black and white. The film shows story of Northern Germany before World War I. All the actors have done justice to their characters. This film shows the hypocrisy of the German adults who punish their children for trivial mistakes but find no faults in abusing women and children, including incestuous relationships.The director showed the courage of having such characters like pastor who ties his adolescent son's hands to the bed because he knew his son had masturbated. A lot of disgraceful events happen at the village, but nobody is bothered about it. The parents look more of pedagogues, who attempts to instill hatred into their children instead of love. One more thing I've seen in this movie is that pure love is detested while hatred is embraced.The kids who are punished for almost nothing, in future will do the same to their young generations. The story was set before the world war 1. So, it was clear that it were the parents and the German elders who were responsible for sowing the seeds of Fascism in the kids. While I was watching the film, I was confused whether the kids were orphans and they were living in the some church orphanage. This is because the kinds of conversation the children have with their parents. This film clearly indicates their is absence of love between the kids and their parents.These kids never received any love so they will do the same to the upcoming generations. They will be ruthless, racist and disrespectful towards women. The director has done a very good job of showing how & why Fascism once surfaced in Germany. This movie is very good in conveying a good message, that Fascism never worked and can never work. This movie is not about who did all those terrible things in the village, rather it was an attempt by the director to show why all that happened. This movie is very good and intelligent but not for everyone. Some people may find it boring and dull. This movie is more educational than being entertaining. So people seeking sheer entertainment may find it boring. But this flick slowly progresses to show gruesome nature of Fascism. I can say one downside of this flick is the length and monotony. Had it been a 90 min film instead of 140 min movie, I would have liked it even more. Anyways it is another great German movie and deserves at least one watch.",7,0,5,6 March 2012
Mamma Mia!," Finally, a movie made for morons...
","Every moron should enjoy this flick, this movie is specially dedicated to all the morons in the world. I think everyone in the film forgot while shooting, that they had to make a movie. They just went on to having a good time and made a complete mess out of a film. I was astounded to see Meryl Streep to work in such a stridently stupid film. I can't blame her for poor acting, the script of the film demanded her to do so.Not only Meryl, but Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, such fine actors are completely wasted in this garbage. It was a shock to see that t the daughter is happy after knowing that her mother had three lovers at the same time and her own mother doesn't know who the father of her kid is, but strangely the daughter is happy to know that one out of three men is her father.Songs in the film are not at all according to the situations. In the end, it was agonizing to see Meryl Streep singing 'The winner takes it all'. Even Pierce Brosnan must be laughing his ass off when the camera faced Meryl and showed his back. Another drawback of the film is that is tries to make sing people who can't sing and it can be vouched by people unanimously.I hope it was a mistake by these fine actors to work in such a film, and they won't make such mistake again. And for the director I want to say- ' YOU ARE A LOSER SO YOU HAVE TO FALL..'",1,7,11,21 June 2012
The Lives of Others," Undoubtedly, deserved an Oscar
","This film is in my favorite five foreign films list. I was not very much familiar with the background of East Germany. I was shocked to see under what enormous pressure a lot of East Germans had to live. In this film, Georg Dreyman is a dramatist and Christa-Maria Sieland is an actress and his girlfriend. As East German politicians were influenced by Russians, it was considered almost criminal to be associated with West German. And, Georg and Christa and their friends are associated with West side. The Minister of Culture becomes interested in Christa, so the secret service agent Wiesler is instructed to observe and sound out the couple.And from here the story becomes complicated. The minister of culture just want to sexually exploit Christa, and on one night he succeeds in doing that, he rapes her. Georg understands that she is being followed by people of Minister. Wiesler, a Secret service agent empathizes with both of them and tries to help them but it is very difficult for Wiesler too, to help them.How, Wiesler sees Georg is a good person and he thinks whatever is done to him is bad. So, he tries to help him. The acting done by everybody is top notch. I have seen Ulrich Mühe before and knew he is a fine actor. Sebastian Koch (Gerog)and Martina Gedeck (Christa)were new to me. I was very impressed with how Sebastian acted. He did a splendid job. And, what can I say about Martina Gedeck, she is drop dead gorgeous even at the age of 45 in this film. But, once again the best performance is delivered by Ulrich Mühe. His expressions are exceptional in this film. I bumped onto this film when I was searching for best films ever made list on IMDb. I'm glad that I had the chance to view this film. I recommend this film to almost everybody irrespective of political knowledge and background of German partition and later their reunification. This is one of those films which are not be missed.",9,3,4,7 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Noomi Rapace the supergirl
","I've become a big fan of Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth Salander, after watching this flick. Lisbeth can do anything. She is a Super-woman in this flick. This flick was awesome. Despite being around 150 min movie, it didn't look dull or slow at any moment.Not only this, I've seen the entire Millennium trilogy, and Noomi Rapace did a complete justice to the character of Lisbeth Salander. I don't think anyone could have played that character better than Noomi.Girl with a dragon tattoo (G.W.D.T) is a story of a hacker Lisbeth Salander who in some circumstances helps out a reporter in solving a case of a girl missing for 40 years. I won't tell anything more. This is a movie one of its own kind, so it must be seen.But I always see that if any good foreign language film is made, Hollywood always tries to make a rehashed version ( 13 tzameti is a good example, the original french version is a way better than the Hollywood version.)The Hollywood version of G.W.D.T looks dull compared to the Swedish version. The actors look perfunctory and the performance by them is not very good. When you make a rehashed version of a foreign flick, you are supposed to make the film better than the original film ( Example is The Departed directed by Martin Scorcese)I'd say stick with the original Swedish version because the performance by the actors are more lively. I give 9/10 to this film and two thumbs up to Noomi Rapace,without whom Lisbeth Salander's character couldn't have lived.",9,0,2,6 March 2012
Mulholland Drive," A wild goose chase
","I am quite a generous reviewer. I am giving this a 3/10. I am kind of biased towards Naomi, otherwise this doesn't deserve more than a zero. As a lot of people may say this movie is very complicated, it gives away clues, you have to find them and you have to decipher the truth. Really, this is horse s#it.The movie is nothing but a set of loose & lousy acts put together and called a movie. There is no worse thing in a suspense movie in which a murder happens, you watch the entire damn movie, but the director doesn't bother to show you who the murderer was( Exception to this is a movie ' Memories of a murder',which was a breathtaking movie).I'd like to discuss this movie in brief. In the beginning an accident occurs, which leaves Laura Harring amnesiac. She sneaks into Naomi Watt's aunt's house. Naomi is a wannabe actress. She tries to help Laura to find, who she is and what really happened that night when accident happened.I am not going to say much about the rest- the dream, the reality, the hallucination and blah, blah, blah. As a lot of reviewers came up with a simple thing that Naomi ( Diane) is in love Laura ( Camila). But Diane can't become a big star, but Camilla becomes one. Then she is all set to be married to the director. Diane can't take it that her love is spurned by Camilla, so hires a guy to kill her and after that can't get over this guilt and also the shame of not living up to the expectations of her parents that she couldn't become a successful actress,so she kills herself.What I said above is a general interpretation of all the reviewers. But I can come up with another one that Diane couldn't become as successful actress as Camilla, so she might have killed her, and then tried to put this thing into her head that she might have had an affair with the director, to become a successful actress. She might not have been able to digest her failure and Camilla's success. That's why she may have dreamed about Camila's affair with the director.The director didn't bother to unravel anything, so we are all free to make our own interpretations. This is just like a painting of a dot ( mere dot) we go to have a look at, at the museum.One guy says this is the beginning of something spectacular, one may say this is the end of life and another may say after pondering a lot that this is just a fu**ing dot.I was amazed to see why it is so highly rated on IMDb. Pretentious people will say i figured it out. But actually there is nothing to be figured out. You are all free to make any interpretations you want. The film was directed by David Lynch, and got away with it once again. Had it been a novice director, he wouldn't have been allowed to direct a movie in his life ever again.How dare these so called intelligent directors to make such kinds of garbage. This works because everyone wants to save his face, by pretending to have understood the film. But actually there is nothing to be understood, this thing should at least be understood by the audience.As I already said, this film won't satisfy your answers, so reluctantly you will have to make up your own answers. Apart from a wild goose chase, this film is lousy & boring as hell. Laura Harring just looked like a beautiful dumb girl in the film. Naomi acts well (as she always does), but there is no script in the film, so she can't do anything about it. And also, Naomi was told by David Lynch to overact.This film was so frustrating that even a person who doesn't have an account on IMDb, will be forced to register and slam this pretentious trash. So, at least the film is successful in something.",3,4,11,28 February 2012
Grave of the Fireflies," A heart-wrenching movie
","Very few times I have cried in my life,and this film did make my eyes tearful. I'd say its one of those films that I wouldn't have the courage to watch another time. This film is the story of two Japanese kids Seita and Setsuko who struggle for their survival in Japan during the world war 2. In the very beginning, Seita and his sister Setsuko escapes their home and go to their distant aunt''s house. In the meanwhile, Seita learns that his mother has succumbed to the injuries she got in an air-raid.Seita hides this truth from Setsuko. Also, their aunt starts bothering them so,they go from there to a cave like shelter and live there. But, they don't have money to buy food. Its all about the hardships they have to go through in order to survive.This film becomes very hard to view particularly in the last 15 minutes. I'd say only heartless people won't feel sad after viewing this film. Only after Requiem for a dream, I have been moved by any film. This is another anti-war film, which shows that irrespective of whoever the victor is war is always bad for the mankind. I recommend every American to watch this film. In the name of war against terrorism they are waging a war against poor and helpless civilians. So. regardless of your age you ought to watch this flick.I watched this film yesterday, but still I can hear Setsuko's voice when she calls Seital. Though, you'll fell upset but that is necessary. I give 10/10 to this film and two thumbs up. Don't miss it.",10,2,4,2 June 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Stunning
","This film is a story of two boys Bruno and Schmuel. Bruno is son of a German commander, while Schmuel is a Jewish boy in a concentration camp which is located near where Bruno has come to live. Bruno doesn't know anything about the concentration camp, while he thinks that it is a farm and farmers wear pajamas. The first time he meets Schmuel, he asks while do you wear such clothes.Many films about Holocaust are made, but this film still is able to look different from the rest. The entire story is seen from the eyes of a young 8 year old boy, who asks his fascist tutor if there is not a single jew, and the tutor replies if Bruno could find even one good jew, he would be the greatest explorer.Bruno's grandmother disapproves what her son that is Bruno's dad does, while Bruno's grandfather is also a fascist. Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga) doesn't want her kids to live near a concentration camp. But Bruno's father is adamant. There are some breathtaking scenes in the film, especially when Bruno asks his father what is being burnt in those chimneys? Really, this is a very cruel reality of which Bruno is completely unaware of, and may not be able to fathom even if he is told.Bruno's sister Greta, a 12 year old, is also fond of Hitler, and may become a fascist in the future. This story is about the friendship of two naive 8 year old German and Jewish boys. Bruno's domestic help Pavel, a Jew is a doctor, but still their servant. Bruno thinks he must not be a good doctor, so now he peels potatoes. Schmuel also doesn't know what is done in the camp'.The most impressive aspect about the film is the dialogue between the two boys, who are completely unaware of the ghastly things going around.You do get very much idea about what is going to happen in the end, but the film in the climax will still shock you and keep you stunned for a while.",9,1,2,2 November 2012
8 Mile," This is much more than a movie, it teaches us to believe in ourselves
","I've seen many movies of singer telling how they made it or how they became big, in a way those movies were trite. One thing I like about this movie is that, this movie doesn't show you how Eminem became the best rapper in the world, but it ends showing he (B. Rabbit) realizes that he also can make it. In the end Eminem refuses Future to co-host the battles with him, because he realizes that his destiny wants something else.Unlike other stars, I always believe that Eminem's life is an open book. Eminem is very honest, he is not a two faced person. He has committed many mistakes in his life, buy, he is a man enough to admit it. Talking about this film, its not just about rappers, while, it can be about anything in the world you love and trying very hard to attain it. The song 'lose yourself' is one of the most meaningful songs I've ever heard. The song is a mirror to the film. The song tells you to believe in yourself. ' You can be anything you set your mind to man..'In this film, Jimmy Smith Jr. who doesn't have a good relationship with his mother, trying very hard to become a rapper. He is white, but wants to become go somewhere which is considered a black man's territory. He has 4 best friends, out of them 3 are black. These friends believe in Rabbit. There is a villainous group of rappers 'Free World' who dominates the rap battles. There's a guy Wink, who wants to en-cash the talent of both Rabbit and Papa Doc. Lastly, Alex, the infidel girlfriend of Rabbit, who has sex with Wink to advance her career.Future always tells Rabbit, that Wink is scandalous stay away from him. But, Rabbit thinks that Wink might help him to get him a chance. But he is shattered when comes to know that Alex cheated on him with Wink. Wink shows his true colors, beats Rabbit with the help of Free World. In the end, Rabbit takes his revenge by beating the Free World and also obliterates the memories when he choked in the battle for the first time. This movie doesn't show how Rabbit became a successful rapper, rather, it ends with Rabbit smiling and believing that he can become what he always have wanted to become. 8 mile is much more than a film, it is a learning curve. It is not just about the rapping, it can be associated with anything that we value in life and ready to give everything in our life to achieve it. This film is not about the success story of Eminem, but an honest story of Jimmy Smith who believes in his ability and knows he can become what he always aspired to become.",9,2,4,18 March 2012
The Hangover Part II," You don't need to have this hangover
","I can't tell you how disappointed I am after watching this. It is exact carbon copy of the prequel. But the prequel was funny. This movie brings very few laughs, unlike the original previous one.The Hangover was so original. This film is not at all funny, despite it tries to imitate the prequel in entirety. It's better if you watch Hangover another time than watching this lame sequel.I hope they don't make Hangover 3, with Alan getting married this time. But if they are poised to make it, please change the theme of 'IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN'There are a few funny moments, but for that to view the movie, is not a good idea.",4,0,0,23 November 2011
Stalingrad," Perfect portrayal of reality
","I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality.The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'.In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors.This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too.I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people.We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.",10,6,9,2 November 2012
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","I have been a fan of Tarantino. The first Tarantino movie I saw was Reservoir dogs. It was fantastic film. I would say this film is even better than the reservoir dogs.As the name of the film suggests, there's not much story in the movie. But, the main thing about the film is about its dialogue exchanges between characters. Like the ones between John Travolta & Samuel Jackson and John Travolta & Uma Thurman.This movie is my second favorite movie. Its an old flick, I watched it on TV first. I liked it immensely, brought the DVD for my collection. Its a roller coaster ride full of fun. Just sit back, relax don't put much pressure on your brain and enjoy this great flick.There aren't many twists and turns but I can assure you that, every moment of this movie is enjoyable. For those who haven't viewed it yet, I want to ask a question- 'What have you been doing all these days? Come on man, watch this movie.'This is Quentin Tarantino's best film. So, I give it a 10/10.It is well worth it.",10,0,4,21 October 2011
The Departed," My favourite film
","'I don't want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me.' The film starts with this dialogue. A question is also popped at the very beginning- 'When you face a loaded gun what's the difference,if you're a cop or a criminal?'At the very outset the mood which is started, is kept till the end.Billy ( Leonardo) is from south Boston, has a family with criminal background, which makes him a suitable undercover in his criminal neighborhood. He is a mole in Costello's( Jack Nicholson)outfit. While, Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon)is a Sergeant in Massachusetts, is actually a mole working for Costello. Throughout the movie Billy & Collin try to figure out each others identity.As referred to as Rock star of the gangsters Costello by Alan Baldwin, truly in this movie Jack Nicholson outshines everyone. His character is so insensitive in this film. Everybody has done justice to their characters. Again , Leonardo proved why he is Martin scorsese's pick. Mark whalberg's character of insulting everyone was very unique, also with Mark's Massachusetts accent, adorned the character.Matt Damon was also very good. One more thing I want to say about this film is about its dialogues. I don't remember hearing so many crispy dialogue exchange, after Pulp Fiction. This movie is very intense throughout, with some twists and turns, that keeps you at the edge of the seat. This movie touches everything like, racial discrimination which was there once in Boston. And, bravely puts forth its opinions.I have seen this movie more than 50 times. But, whenever I see it, it never bores me. This movie teaches you a lot of harsh realities of life. Martin scorsese dished out so many good flicks. But, according to me this has to be his best film. He gave it all. Deservedly, it won an Oscar This is one of the best crime thrillers of all time. I would recommend everyone to watch this great flick.Hats off and all my clothes off to Martin scorsese for giving this incredible film. I'd like to finish this review off with a quote in this film- ' No one gives it to you, you have to take it.'",10,3,6,20 October 2011
The Woman in Black," Daniel Radcliffe bids adieu to Harry Potter persona
","One thing comes out of your mouth, when you see Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps and that's- WOW. I thought it would be very weird to see Daniel as somebody else other than Harry Potter, but he played Arthur Kipps quite brilliantly. Although, he is still very young and didn't look like a father of a 4 year old, but, what matters is acting and that he did quite well.This movie is a remake of a 1989 movie of the same title. I didn't see the old flick. But when I saw the reviews of the old flick I wanted to see it. But, I thought it would be wise to wait for a few months, as I knew the remake was going to be made. The movie was good, it was not stupid and gory as nowadays horror films are made. It was a good scary movie with a fine story and nice (it seemed reasonable to me) ending. It relied on good acting of Daniel as well old fashioned scary moments.I was looking forward to see this movie, as I wanted to see how Daniel would come out of the Harry Potter persona. He did it quite well actually. Normally, if an image of a particular actor is built, it becomes quite difficult for him to break out of that image( All the characters of FRIENDS look stupid in anything other than FRIENDS). But I think Daniel is a fine actor and he will go a long way.It is a nice old fashioned horror movie, which will be liked by the people who are not amused by stupid gory flicks.",7,1,4,7 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Emotional adieu to a great series
","I am writing this review not to recommend anyone to watch this flick. Because, I know all those who have been fans of Harry Potter will see the Grand farewell to this epic series, irrespective of the reviews. As my story with this Series goes, I remember I was 14 when I watched first Harry Potter film. I watched the first Harry Potter film after the second installment had been released 4- 5 months back.I watched first H.P film by accident. I was watching cable with something good to be viewed. I happened to bump into a flick with a small boy. Later on it is turned out in the movie that, this boy was special and gifted. Then I realized, that movie was Harry Potter's first installment. Soon after watching the first installment, I liked it so much that the very next day as I remember I rented the Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets and seen it.Since then my fascination for H.P films has been immense. I was waiting for this flick for a long time. This is my personal opinion that Harry potter films from 5th installment seemed, kind of stagnant( except for the Half blood prince)From the 5th part a new director had come with a new style. I think the first four flicks were better than the latter ones.I had great anticipation from the last 2 parts. But, I don't know why it fails to create that emotions as it should have generated. There are some very emotional scenes, but they are too hasty as though left incomplete. I didn't read the books as I thought it would kill interest in watching movies. I relied entirely on movies. But, as the first four films don't seem incomplete, the latter ones do seem( again half blood prince is exception.)I am not complaining about the movie. It has been directed greatly, but a lot of things are not explained even after making 2 parts of the last book, can cause confusions in minds of those who haven't read the book.A lot of things unravel in this films. Some misconceptions also are done away, with the main one with contempt turns into reverence. I don't want to drop any spoiler. This is kind of silly of me to say, but I always felt sad after watching new installment of H.P, as I knew we are one step closer to the end of Harry Potter. That's why this film becomes very emotional that we are not going to be able to see Harry, Ron, Hermione or any other H.P characters again.As Harry Potter franchise ended, there is a feeling of happiness with ambivalence of melancholy alongside. Surely, this film is a deluge of emotions throughout. There are instances of it throughout the movie. A lot of characters who died in this movie deserved more scenes, but only their dead bodies are shown. Here, I'd say at least their fights could have been shown. It becomes injustice to these characters, whom we saw in seven H.P films.Nevertheless, this is a great end to a mesmerizing tale of a boy who lived. I grew up watching this film and will never forget Harry Potter. The series might have been ended, but Harry will live in our hearts throughout our lives. And, we will never forget Harry Potter. I want to say 'Thank you' to J. K Rowling for giving us Harry Potter. I give 10/10 to Harry Potter and 9/10 to this flick and hope if Lord Voldemort could come back once again so that we could see Harry once again.",9,1,2,21 October 2011
