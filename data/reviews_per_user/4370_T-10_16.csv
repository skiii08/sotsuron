Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," an epic saga begins
","Not being 'into' Star Wars my comments may see elementary.  The Phantom Menace has so much to offer I saw it twice and am considering going again. First it's a feast for the eyes with its tremendous special effects and fictional 'beings'.  The film deals with all the elements of humanity --- history, science, psychology, philosophy, sociology, morality, and emotion. There is so much to absorb.  George Lucas has woven an excellent tale with fascinating characters. My only criticism is Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor probably my two favorite actors seem underutilized.  Although as I've said it's a feast for the eyes, the dialogue and acting done or needed from the leads was a bit underwhelming.  I'm not so sure this wasn't Mr. Lucas' intent --- not to overshadow the storyline in any way.  Regardless it was great entertainment.  Three and a half stars!!!",9,0,0,31 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," simply the best
","I hesitate to compare the writers of this film, Mr. Norman and Mr. Stoppard, to Mr. Shakespeare, but I know the latter would have enjoyed it.  He often took real people and facts about their lives and with artistic license wove wonderful stories So it is with the writers of this film and their subject Will Shakespeare. I must say I'm sure a lot of license was taken but their take on relating it and weaving into the life of young Will was pure entertaining genius.  I don't want to mention any specifics here.  Let me say that you should not let the subject of Shakespeare or the Elizabthean period scare you away.  Just as Shakespeare wrote for the masses and his take on the human condition is still relevant today, this film has characters and relationships that are as valid today as then.  The film cont ains love, hate, passion, duty, willfulness anger, and all other aspects of humanity. It also contains many well written laugh out loud exchanges.  Besides this the actors from the leads on down were ALL excellent.  My highest praise goes to Mr. Fiennes. He is a real find.  He brought a young passionate Shakespeare to life and I look forward to seeing his next film.  Ms. Paltrow was also good as Viola, his leading lady.  I was also impressed by the performance of Mr. Rush who I am used to seeing in parts somewhere between serious and sinister.  He has a gift for comedy as well. Outstanding performances were also given by Mr. Everett (Marlowe), Shakespeare's sometimes rival--sometimes friend, Mr. Affleck (Ned Allen), Shakespeare's leading actor, and Ms. Dench in a fantastic portra yal of Queen Elizabeth.  This was truly one of the best movies of 1998 and it is a pity it does not seem to be in wide release.  I would encourage you to make an effort to see it.  You will not be disappo inted.  Four Stars!",10,0,0,28 December 1998
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A well-timed, thoughtful work
","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut addresses many current social issues besides being uproariously funny.  The vast majority of people in the audience each time I saw this film were laughing outloud.  The film is -- to say the very least -- politically incorrect, crude, and irreverent of 'traditional' values, and while poking fun at politics, religion, ethnic and social issues, it does not take itself too seriously either.  The movie is inventively presented as a musical and has the feel of an old MGM film or Broadway show.  The songs written mostly by Trey Parker were very well done and fit well.  BUT what the movie does best is address the MPAA ratings issue and in a larger context the question of what is wrong with contemporary American society.  By the way, I believe I read this movie had to cut to get an 'R' rating.  It presents the cultural war going on in America today.  Is it values (allegedly decreasing) or violence (allegedly increasing) which is at the heart of our social problems?  The movie addresses these issue subtly, all the while being hilarious.  This is a well crafted movie that can be appreciated on more than one level.  CAUTION: It deserves its rating and if you are easily offended avoid this film. Otherwise I highly recommend this film for its importance and entertainment value.  Three and half stars!!!",9,0,0,13 July 1999
Elizabeth," historical film at its best
","I don't know enough about sixteenth century English history to know that the film is totally accurate, but can say that the film left me wanting more.  Again like so many good films I wish it could have gone longer. It is relativly short only about two hours and covers only the initial years of Elizabeth's reign where she is consolidat- ing power against the will of the Pope and his followers. The characters from the lead, Ms. Blanchett, to Mr. Rush (Walsing- ham), her ruthless advisor, to Mr. Eccleston (Norfolk), her court adversary, to Mr. Fiennes (her lover), to Mr.Cassel (her roy al suitor), to Mr. de la Quadro (the Spani sh ambassador, to Ms. Burke (Mary, her sister) were all excellent playing well written interesting characters.  The film sets the Medieval mood well with great cin ematography and costuming but we feel a certain connection to all the characters----good and bad.  Could it be that human nature has not changed much in the last four centuries, although I would like to think that we are less ruthless? The movie has love, passion, hate, fear, loyalty, deceit, and laughter.  The story although I'm sure embellished, is essential ly true, told in an appealing way, filmed well, and presented by an excellent cast. What more could you possibly ask except perhaps another hour of film.  Many thanks to all involved.  A strong three and half stars.",10,0,1,2 December 1998
10 Things I Hate About You," Young love, complications, confusion, plotting ---- sounds like Shakespeare to me
","Although 10 Things I Hate About You will never be the classic Taming Of the Shrew, it is nonetheless a well written and well acted story.  The leads, Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles were terrific.  Both have a stage presence and there was good chemistry between them.  The other characters were interesting and well played. Some of the situations in the film felt very familiar as this was obviously one of many teen romantic comedies, but that is not necessarily a negative criticism. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and the hundred minutes went by quickly. If I had one criticism, I would say that after such a good movie the final scene was a small letdown.  I almost forgot to mention the soundtrack is fantastic.  I must also say that Heath Ledger stole the show and am looking forward to see more of his work.  On the basis of solid entertainment, three stars!!!",Null,0,0,15 April 1999
American Pie," a well seasoned confection
","American Pie has all the ingredients of a good movie.  First, the plot deals with young people in search of their first sexual experience.  What could be more basic to the human condition?  Second, although obviously fiction, the film has a feeling of reality capturing the awkwardness and anxiety of young people at this point in their lives.  Third, it is well written and not always predictable as each young man employs his own strategy, and of course, in the real world things do not always go as planned.  Fourth, the cast consists of very talented young actors playing characters which may remind the audience of people they may have known.  Fifth, the film has its poignant moments. The final ingredient is this movie is hilarious.  The film has one liners, sight gags, and situations that very funny.  The audience, which ranged from teenagers to middle age, laughed almost constantly and out loud.  CAUTION: This film is rated 'R' for sexual situations and the use of alcohol by young people.  If you are easily offended or sexual humor makes you uncomfortable, stay away.  However, if you are not in the aforementioned, you may enjoy it.  Three stars!!!",Null,71,102,27 July 1999
American History X," graphic, powerful, compelling, and thought provoking
","In the age of three hour movies I wish this had been.  In the just two hours the film did not develop some of its most im- portant story lines.  I wanted to see more development of Derek's move away from Neo- Nazi ideals and Danny's move towards. This may have served to give more meaning to the final scenes and made them seem less contrived and routine.  It may seem I did not like this film, but, in fact, I wanted to see more--more character develop ment, more dialogue between the main char- acters, more transitional scenes--just more!  On the positive side this is probably the most important movie of the year and is a 'must see'.  I particularly liked the cinematography.  The black and white flashbacks and the great number of close-up face shots were great.  They set the mood for the film as both dark and intense. The honest presentation of political and social problems that face the country in the late 20th Century is laudable.  Mr. Norton portrays a convincing, sometimes loathsome but sometimes very human even likable skinhead.  His journey to and from these ideals and the relationship with his younger brother, Mr. Furlong, make this a most compelling story.  Mr. Norton's performance is worthy of best actor consideration in his successful portrayal of this complex character.  I would emphasize that this film is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it is brutally (in all senses of the word) honest, and if you don't leave the theater thinking and/or talking then I suggest a brain scan.  Once again thanks to Mr. Norton for an outstanding performance.  Four stars for his performance and the topic even though it could have used a more (see above)",10,0,0,27 November 1998
Velvet Goldmine," Mesmerizing with an interesting premise
","Who would have thought that glam rock was an otherworldly descendant of Oscar Wilde? Well I think most anyone that has seen a performance but never thought about it consciously.  This 'obvious' idea was captured by Todd Haymes who wrote and directed Velvet Goldmine.  The story borrows elements from Oscar Wilde, Citizen Kane, pop icons that resemble David Bowie and Iggy Pop, and quasi-premise of the B movie, Eddie and Cruisers.  All this mells into a surreal story of love and fame.  I will not be specific in telling the story but if you find androgyny and bisexuality offensive don't see this movie, but that would be to pigeonhole this film unfairly. The story is told thru Arthur (Christian Bale) who is an investigative reporter looking for a glam rocker, Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who has disappear- ed.  In his search he finds Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor) also a rocker but also Slade's inspiration, friend, and former lover.  All the performers were excellent. They showed great versatilty in that it traces their lives from the teenage years with the turmoil of maturing and sexuality to midde age.  I was also impressed that both Mr. McGregor and Mr. Myers did many of their own vocals.  The story also cunningly weaves the story of the reporter in with that of the two protagonists.  As a person old enough to remember the glam rock era, this movie portrays well and captures the feeling of that time.  It does so with fantastic costuming and cinematography as honest believable charac ters.  Velvet Goldmine is great entertainment I will hope and look for much more from Mr. McGregor who if they ever do the story of Kurt Cobain he should star as I could not help but see a striking resemblance as well as Mr. Rhys-Meyes, and Mr. Bales.  All were EXCELLENT.  Three and a half stars!",9,2,3,8 March 1999
Meet Joe Black," well acted and written, good romantic comedy
","If you are looking for a fast paced movie Meet Joe Black is not for you.  However, if you are looking for a good movie that is humorous and touching even though it deals realistically (even in farcial way) with the extremely serious subject of Death then this is the movie for you.  The movie takes its time and develops all the character well.  The dialogue is excellent and the supporting cast is very good, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins are great.  Mr. Pitt who plays Joe Black/Death is the only actor I can think of who have played this part.  He is an excellent actor who plays the part of an attractive, both socially and physically with his boy next good looks, Death (Joe Black).  He is actually likeable in his innocence.  I can hardly say enough about him.  Mr. Hopkins who is certainly one of the best actors of 20th Century was excellent as well. The chemistry between the two is great, and I suspect that they like and respect each other off the set.  The movie is about three hours long but I did not notice until after.  If you like well written, well acted, good dialogue, and great characters then you will enjoy Meet Joe Black.  I would give this movie three plus stars and once again thank Mr. Pitt for an excellent performance.",Null,0,0,23 November 1998
Life Is Beautiful," The power of love!
","Let me first say that I don't think Life Is Beautiful trivializes the Holocaust.  Admittedly it uses the stark cruelty and violence of the Holocaust only as a back-drop to love of a father who is desperately trying to protect his son by playing a game which has a comedic outcome to the viewer, but in fact is a deadly game. I'm sure the actual cruelty was also soft-pedalled somewhat so as not to overshadow the father/son relationship.  However Roberto Benigni who co-wrote, directed, and starred in this film makes no doubt as to how he feels about the perpetrators of the Holocaust and mocks them at every turn whether it be his comment about 'Visigoths and spiders' or the using of the guard at the camp or the shallowness of what appeared to be a sympathetic friend/camp doctor. Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, and even (forgive me) the Three Stooges have all mocked the Fascists.  I believe that Benigni, who is brilliant in all his roles, in this film offers a story of triumph of the human spirit where comedy is only protection for his son. The film also captures the era well and features a strong performance by Nicolleta Braschi as his wife and an outstanding performance by Georgio Cantarini as his son. I will see this film again.  Four stars!",10,1,3,13 February 1999
The Red Violin," An ambitious story that delivers
","What can you say about a film that covers three centuries, people from all stations of society, and several European countries and Canada. Ambitious is a good start.  This film was very well crafted and at about one hundred forty minutes was too short for me.  The story follows a red violin, an inanimate object, although at times it seemed alive to me, thru three centuries and the influences good and ill that it has on its possessors.  It does ever seem to be owned.  Each of its possessors lives a life of passion and turmoil.  The violin's birth is during turmoil and during its life it buried, shot, and almost burned.  The writing which includes this parallel between the violin and its possessor , five somewhat independent segments that mell and converge in the final scenes, and a story told by tarot cards make for an extremely unique experience.  Add to that the musical score, scenery, the varied languages and cultures and you have a great offering. The performances were all strong, but I thought Jason Flemyng as Lord Frederick Pope stood out.  To say his character was eccentric and maybe a little over the top is justifiable but I'm sure that was intended.  English nobility has always been known for its idiosyncrasies.  The ending has incongruous feel with     the remainder of the film but is satisfactory and I can not suggest a better one.  Great entertainment!  Three and a half stars!!!",9,21,25,6 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," delightfully simple and at the same time complex
","Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing mixture of the simple and complex.  Mr. Kubrick took as his premise the simple idea of marital infidelity.  As we know, the actual act of infidelity need not be physical but can be emotional and can be done very simply but the repercussions are complex. This film has so much to offer that it should be seen twice to mine all its gems.  So I will make only a few general observations.  The cinematography was unusual providing almost a surreal feeling.  At times it seemed as if it had been filmed in the '50's or 60's as there was not much color variation with an emphasis on the primaries.  It also seemed unusual that although the film is about two and a half hours that each scene in Dr. Bill Hartford's odyssey seemed almost self-contained and not necessary to the other parts but important to the whole.  The basic part of the soundtrack consisting of a one finger piano chord was highly effective as a mood setter.  The sex scenes which got so much pre-release press were neither gratuitous or erotic but were cold and depersonalizing.  One can only wonder why the need for computer generated images to cover what we're not sure to acquire the 'R' rating for the North American version.  One more movie of the summer of '99 to debate the MPAA rating system.  To make more in depth comments I'll have to see this film again (which I will).  Recommended.  Three plus stars!!!",Null,0,0,24 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," most interesting film of the year
",Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing mixture of the simple and the complex.  Let me first say that I plan to see this film again as there is too much to absorb in one viewing.  For that reason my observations will be basic.  Mr. Kubrick took the simple premise of marital infidelity -- perceived or real -- and wove a complex story in which to see should not always be to believe.  I thought the filming was unusual at times providing almost a surreal feeling. It also felt as if it was filmed in the late '50's or '60's with little color variation and an emphasis on primary colors.  The film is well over two hours long but each scene in Dr. Bill Hartford's odyssey seemed almost free-standing not necessary to the other parts but only to the whole.  The soundtrack consisting of a one finger piano chord was a highly effective mood setter.  The sex scenes which got so much pre-release press were neither gratuitous or erotic but cold and depersonalizing.  What is the difference between the North American and the European versions?  Another film of summer of '99 to give cause for discussing MPAA ratings.  None of the aforementioned comments should be read as negative and only add to my interest in the film.  The lead performances by Mr. Cruise and Ms. Kidman were fantastic.  As I've said I will see this film again.  Recommended. Three plus stars!!!,Null,0,0,17 August 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Was it Jimmy Breslin who wrote the book, The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight? In this case change it to Gangs.
","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels was written and directed brilliantly by Guy Ritchie.  This shoot 'em farce about inept criminals was well crafted with interesting characters too numerous to mention.  There is no 'lead' character and arguably a dozen or so main characters. The dialogue was great, if at times a little hard to follow, with the lyrical Eastender cockney slang. The movie involves several groups of criminals and more plot twists than you can imagine.  I really wish I could've seen this movie twice.  There are many gems to be mined in this film and I know I didn't find them all.  I will rent, and if possible buy, this video.  I have never seen a film quite like this and am not sure there is one.  One warning there is alot of violence in this film although most is done off camera  and the audience only sees the results.  It even makes the violence --- dare I say --- funny.  Unique and great entertainment.  Four Stars!!!!",10,0,0,6 June 1999
Tarzan," Great entertainment for everyone
","Tarzan is a near perfect film for the entire family.  It has comedy, drama, a soundtrack that fits well with what happening on the screen, feelings and emotions, and it's fun.  The animators outdid themselves.  The background scenery was stunning and lifelike.  The opening scenes were well written and emotionally satisfying (I think it unfair to be specific). The scene in which Tarzan morphs from a child to an adult was visually brilliant.  The choice of Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan's voice was excellent.  It had a warmth and vulnerability that brought a new dimension to the obvious physicality of the apeman.  The other outstanding voice selection was Glenn Close who voiced Kala, Tarzan's ape mother.  She brought real feelings of sensitivity and nurturing.  There were times when my eyes got moist (yes I'm an old softy). At other times the action sequences had you feeling as if riding a roller coaster.  Great!  Probably the only weakness in the film was the obligatory villain and that subplot which neither added or took away from the film but just seemed tacked on.  All in all, Tarzan is a great movie and should be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.  Three and half stars!!!",10,0,0,23 June 1999
The Thin Red Line," It's no Saving Pvt. Ryan----it's more!
","Let me first say that I saw this film twice.  Once before and once after the Oscar nominations.  The nomination was NOT the reason I went to see it a second time. I had already decided to because of the film's uniqueness, thoughtfulness, and, yes, the confusion which I felt while watching the film.  First I thought that the film treated the Japanese, the enemy, evenhandedly showing them no better or worse than the oft times confused American GI's.  In fact most of the post battle violence was American.  The movie is presented in narration by personal thoughts was an interesting aspect and featured unusual and compelling flashbacks.  The movie seemed to more about psychology, personality, and philosophy more than war, but the war with its inherent graphic violence is very much present.  What I thought was outstanding and very unusual about this war film was the cinematography ---not the battle scenes but nature.  It is every featured in this film.  Whether it is the beautiful tropical grasses the soldiers are crawling thru or the water scenes including the ocean, a waterfall, and a stream all shot in captivating ways or and animals from tropical birds to fruit bats to lizards making appearances unexpectedly, nature is everywhere evident.  I'm sure there is a symbolic element here and I have my opinions but I'll let you draw your own conclusions.  Lastly (and not in importance) there were many outstanding performances. Mr. Penn as the straight arrow sergeant, Mr. Koteas as the independent captain, Mr. Nolte as the ambitious Lt. Colonel, Mr. Harrelson as an emotional gut driven sergeant, and Mr. Caviezel as the sensitive off-center (I don't know if that's the right word) foot soldier, all were great characters and played superbly.  Personally I thought Mr. Caviezel was the best of the best but it is a close call.  There are countless other great characters and performances as well. This movie was worth seeing twice.  There is so much offered by this film that I absorbed more and appreciated it even the second time.  Please do not consider this a criticism.  It is great one time experience.  FOUR STARS!!!!",10,0,0,12 February 1999
