Vertigo," 'You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.'
","Vertigo is an absolutely fascinating look into the deep psychological effect trauma can have on the mental health of an otherwise completely sane individual. James Stewart stars as John Ferguson, a San Francisco detective forced to retire after witnessing the tragic death of his partner. The incident causes him to develop a debilitating fear of heights and the toll it takes on his mental health becomes the focus of the beginning of the film. He is forced to bring an end to his brief retirement when a friend from college contacts him to solve the mystery of his wife's peculiar behavior, and Ferguson's fragile mental state is exacerbated by the unbelievable nature of the situation. One of, if not the best aspect of this film is James Stewart's outstanding performance. I was hugely impressed by his unique and exceptional presence. Everything about Stewart is leading man material. His voice and appearance and the way he presents his character are all so amusingly Scottish and he makes John Ferguson such a compelling character. The entire film relies on his ability to feel genuine. he needs to be convincing and real for Hitchcock's story to succeed, and he does not disappoint. He becomes progressively less stable as the story unfolds, and he gives this an undeniably authentic feel. I was deeply affected by what he had become by the end of the film, I actually worried for Ferguson as a character, and that made him unforgettable.The most important part of making a great mystery is a story that can remain intriguing throughout. It needs to be puzzling enough for the film's success to ride entirely on the conclusion, and it needs to deliver in a way that leaves the viewer effected by the mystery itself. With a good mystery, you're left pondering the implications of everything that had transpired. One of the things I really loved about the film was how uncompromising it was in it's originality. Vertigo felt like Vertigo, it felt like its own entity free from comparison. There aren't many other stories so captivating. Vertigo refused to underwhelm.Vertigo is surrounded by a daunting amount of hype, to the point where you can't really expect it to live up to everything it's made out to be. Instead of simply surpassing my expectations, which it did, it also proved itself to have a real, admirable complexity to it. Vertigo creates a riveting world for John Ferguson, and that's something only the best films can do.",10,5,8,4 November 2014
Casablanca," 'Of all the whiskey bars in all of Northwest Africa she decides to visit my establishment'
","Casablanca is the story of an American man in WWII era Morocco and his struggle in choosing between 'love and virtue'. Confronted by the woman he once loved and her new husband, a Czech resistance leader and important figure in the fight against the Nazis, the film focuses on Rick's internal conflict over deciding between his desires or the good of many others.Casablanca is a testament to what you can accomplish with a spectacular cast and a beautiful, thoughtfully made set. The vast majority of the film takes place in Rick's Cafe Americain and focuses on a handful of characters, but even with it's relatively crowded story it never fails to feel well rounded and entirely better off than if were to use a wider array of characters and locations.Humphrey Bogart stars as Rick Blaine, the owner of Rick's Cafe Americain. Bogart gives the film a career defining performance and makes his character the most compelling male lead I've ever seen in a love story. When dealing with the politics brought into the Cafe Americain he's cool, calm, and composed in his efforts to remain neutral in all matters, but when we see him alone after hours in his office he becomes very convincingly distraught over his love interest Ilsa. He is shown on multiple occasions alone in his office shrouded by the complete darkness of a Casablancan night, with only a thin ray of light shining through a window to illuminate his face. He drinks from a tall bottle of booze with a grim, haunted expression that gave me a real empathy for the toll his endeavors were taking on him. The rest of the cast performed well enough that there were no noticeable weak links, but there was really no way for them to escape the shadow cast by Bogart's performance.My favorite thing about the film was Rick's Cafe Americain. The Cafe itself was just a series of sets constructed in Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank California, but it was so fitting and perfect for the film it left the same kind of impression that would be made by a well made fantasy location. Its stone walls were decorated in the shadows left by ornate lamps and intricate patterns made to shine light in from the outside. It was so packed full of extras during all of the scenes taking place there that it always created the atmosphere of a real bar. These things were vital to the film because so much of it was contained within these walls, and it was so great that I loved every moment of the scenes there.Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day.",9,2,3,15 October 2014
Chinatown," 'You can't eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday.'
","Roman Polanski's decision to take on the film noir genre after it had given birth to so many timeless classics was a bold choice. He was diving in to a deep sea of talent and ingenuity decades after the grandmasters of film had sold their souls to Satan for the black magic necessary to take the limited and restrictive technology available at the time and make the delicious oreo visuals that made great films even greater despite something like technicolor visuals still being the fever dream of a schizophrenic whisper. But despite the Vesuvian challenge lain out before them, the people responsible for Chinatown managed to make a film so great that there's no doubt in my mind it could go toe to toe with any of the classics and end up absolutely busting its sorry face. I'm talking a good old fashioned jaw- ripping, tooth necklace making face busting. That is to say if Chinatown were faced with a 'Two films enter, one film leaves' type situation, my money's on Chinatown.First of all, you cannot deny that Chinatown's screenplay is absolutely immaculate. It's a known fact that when da Vinci painted The Last Supper, he had looked into the future and found his inspiration in Chinatown. By the time I reached the credits I couldn't even handle how totally and completely impressed I was by how excellent the story had been. The events were so cinematic, yet it never stopped being believable for a single solitary moment. This was a story that spent the film's entire 130 minute runtime twisting and gnarling into an incredible mystery. It was like a political thriller mixed with a horror movie. J.J. Gitties was sent through a labyrinth of despair. The man was so broken and beaten when the credits started rolling, if he was a real person I wouldn't be surprised at all to hear he had collaspsed and died from the mental exhaustion. This brings me to the ending. I wouldn't even hesitate to say this film has the best ending in the history of film. It's so satisfyingly tragic I felt like all my emotions had been emulsified into a gray caustic sludge and tossed into the ocean. The look on Jack Nicholson's face when Walsh tells him 'Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown.' is going to be burned into my mind forever. I thought his performance in Cuckoo's Nest was amazing, but he was just perfect in this role. This movie is the juice. The juicy juice.",10,2,3,7 December 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," We headin' out to Californee!
","In what has to be one of the greatest adaptations of a novel ever, we follow the Joad family, and more specifically their ex-con son with a heart of gold made infinitely likable due to an outstanding performance by Henry Fonda. This is the kind of film you just don't ever want to end. Nunnally Johnson does an incredible job making John Steinbeck's words ready for the screen and John Ford never fails to do justice to the narrative. When a character performs a longer dialog, you can tell you're seeing it with the same impact readers felt reading it. When Tom Joad walks across a lonesome road under the dim blue sky of an early morning you just have to imagine Steinbeck was proud of the people who worked so hard to bring his work to a new medium.The story of the Joad family is a rough one. It begins with Tom fresh out of prison for what is described as self defense. It seems hopeful, but this is the last good fortune he'll see for a long while. Upon finding his family displaced and staying with an uncle, he learns that they've been removed from the farm where the Joad family had been sharecropping for decades. Their seemly only hope is a sizable journey towards California, so they load up a 'jalopy' far past its breaking point to set out on a trail ripe with misery in hopes of rebuilding. You start out rooting for the Joads, how could you not? But the film subjects them to a myriad of misfortunes along the way. Your hope turns to pity quickly, but you can't help but appreciate how much you admire their courage. It's remarkable how much I came to feel for the Joads. Tom is an outstanding protagonist, and you're with him till the very end.A film with a story this great would do fine without being technically impressive and pleasant to look at, but those aspects are wonderfully done too. The film looks incredibly crisp. I didn't manage to forget it was black and white, but I couldn't take my mind off how great it looked. You can see every mark on a person's face, every detail in Tom's scar, and California's ugly brown hills and beautiful green pastures are both presented just as they are to this day.I genuinely loved this movie. It had such an emotional impact. It was hard seeing the Joad family suffer, and it was such a relief to see them finally catch a break. Tom Joad was such a great character that by the end of the film he actually felt like a brother. The film really makes you feel like a Joad yourself, looking back at the family's history. I've been lucky enough to see Cannery Row on a few occasions, and I've seen with my own eyes the fields that the migrant workers of the time would have gone to in search of work. It gave the film a great impact. I'm glad I took the time to watch something so well done that I enjoyed so much.",10,3,4,3 October 2014
Annie Hall," 'You should be ashamed of yourself.'
","This won best picture? Was I watching the right movie? All I would need to write to explain what I thought about Annie Hall would be 'Neurotic and tiresome.' But I guess I can try to stretch that out a bit.First of all, could Woody Allen have had a higher opinion of himself? You remember that 'What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.' 'Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about.' part? That's the whole movie. Woody Allen's love letter to himself. It felt like he wanted to write a relateable version of himself but ended up just trying to convince the viewer that he's better than everyone else by explaining that all of his flaws just make him more genius. It began to physically hurt me every time he spoke. Stop stuttering, you weasel-person.Another thing that made me hate this irritating gremlin-man was his style of directing. Why did anyone like this? It was so disjointed, every scene just hurriedly chopped into the next like Allen's boney little arms were trying to force together two puzzle pieces that didn't quite fit. It had no cohesion, there was no flow to this movie. I guess he might have been trying to make the film feel neurotic like its protagonist? Even if that were the case, that just didn't work for me at all. It reminded me of my favorite film from this year, Birdman. That film was shot and presented like it was all done in one long shot, so it flowed together and the structure was relaxing. Annie Hall was the antithesis of that. Every transition felt like a collision. Maybe it was meant to represent Allen's use of the bumper cars to let out his frustrations. I think I've grown to hate this man on a personal level.Films are a great joy to me. I love watching movies. Usually, even if a movie turns out to be bad, I'll still enjoy the experience. There are a few exceptions to this, however. Annie Hall is one of those exceptions. This film brought me no joy, it provided no entertainment. It was a chore for me. If this film was a banana, my favorite fruit, it would be black and mushy, and I have no plans to make any banana bread, Woody Allen.",3,2,6,8 December 2014
The Graduate," 'You aren't one of those agitators, are you?'
","My favorite thing about this film is the way in which I connect with Ben. Just having graduated, he faces the daunting task of moving forward from his academic career, but with no idea of what he wants to do next. I'm facing the same crisis. Months away from graduating, I face the same difficult decision as Ben. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. What I love most about this connection I had with the main character is, despite it all, I don't find Ben relatable whatsoever, and I think that's absolutely hilarious.The Graduate's great sense of humor is personified wonderfully by its leading man Dustin Hoffman. He's a handsome guy, much better looking than me, and I envy that, but he manages to gives his character Ben a remarkable awkwardness. It's his performance that gives the events in the film weight. He presents himself as the type of person that could really cause these types of ridiculous situations. It's not enough to make you feel like these things could actually happen, but just enough to give it a relate verisimilitude as a film. Bonus points to me for that wonderful use of narrative jargon.The film has plenty of flaws, however. The most prominent of which being the accompanying soundtrack. I have to imagine Mike Nichols was dangerously high when he decided it would be a great idea to use the same handful of Simon and Garfunkel songs dozens of times throughout the film. The narrative structure of the film also bothered me a bit. It spends quite a lot of time on Ben's affair with Mrs. Robinson, which is good by itself, Anne Bancroft gives an excellent performance, but it doesn't leave enough room for the rest of the story. Ben's relationship with Elaine Robinson is so rushed that the film takes a big hit. The second half of the film always influences an opinion of the film more so than the first, it's fresher in your mind, it's what you're dwelling on when the film ends. The rushed nature of their relationship is obviously intentional, as evidenced by the final scene, but that doesn't necessarily mean it works.All in all, The Graduate is a completely unique film, and that's why people love it. It doesn't have to conform, so it doesn't, and that's something to be admired. I know I enjoyed it, but I'm not really sure of my final verdict on the film, and the thing is, I didn't really need to be to write about it. That's something not many films can do.",7,0,0,4 December 2014
Singin' in the Rain," 'Gee, I'm glad you turned up, we've been looking inside every cake in town.'
","Singin' in the Rain is an impressive film because it possesses an infectious glee. It's a film that sets out to be enjoyable and fun, and it does this so well it achieves a level of quality normally reserved for serious, austere films. It has a very jubilant nature that focuses on being entertaining, and I really admire its devotion to making its audience happy.Singin' in the Rain is a lighthearted musical comedy about a studio and it's actors dealing with a difficult transition to sound. The co-director Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a multi-talented actor struggling with growing doubts over his acting ability. After his first attempt at a drama with sound is an embarrassing failure, he and the character that is essentially his sidekick despite being more likable and talented than him, Cosmo Brown, along with love interest Kathy Seldon are able to salvage the film and inexplicably fly a convertible into the sky in the middle of a carnival. I had a hard time connecting with a musical. Not to say I didn't like it, it's just not my genre of choice.Here's the thing, I feel like I just don't know enough about musicals to articulate my feelings about the film. I know it was good, and I know the actors were some seriously talented dancers, but I know nothing about dance. All I'm really sure of is that the movie was fun. I had a good time watching it. It was genuinely funny and Donald O'Conner was outstandingly charismatic and impressive in being able to stand out as the most skilled dancer and funniest character. Hopefully I can write something better for West Side Story.",8,0,1,4 November 2014
Pulp Fiction," 'I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet.'
","Essential viewing. This film is an absolute heavyweight. I must have seen it dozens of times by now, and it doesn't really ever stop being entertaining. A lot of the most well made movies don't really allow themselves to be fun. They try to be more of a statement, and I love that, it brings me an immense joy to watch a classically structured, no-nonsense, beautifully artful film. But Pulp Fiction is just so much fun that it managed to infiltrate the ranks of the elite, and when it got there it decided to throw a party.What's not to love about Pulp Fiction? Every aspect is built like a roller coaster; the film is just a big, crazy amusement park. Most important to me, though, and I'm sure many others, would have to be the story's structure. Have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film? It's crazy. It's like when the film is in the correct order it doesn't make sense anymore. It wouldn't fit the film because it's too much fun for an A to B. The way Quentin Tarantino weaved the film's content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well. The film just flows. The transitions are so fluid. And the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling. Just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it. Vincent, Jules, and Butch are really just normal people in the world of Pulp Fiction, but to the viewer they're so much larger than life. Not only do Vincent and Jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners, but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry Vincent and Butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other. The conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding. Jules, though, Jules is excellent. A great character played by a great actor. Samuel L Jackson steals every single scene he's in. His monologues are legendary. This man must have needed some great vengeance AND furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did. He was one bad mother.I remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like. I thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandora's box on my concept of what a movie could be. Looking back, I think I was right.",10,1,3,8 December 2014
Psycho," 'Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly...'
","In a long line of great films, Psycho has got to be Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining. Despite being a horror movie, and having its fair share of genuinely frightening moments, Psycho has always struck me as being made to have a certain lighthearted charm. I have to imagine when Alfred Hitchcock made this film he was having fun and wanted the film to be as fun for us as it was for him. It's one of my favorite scary movies, but when I look back to it I don't think of it at all like I do the others on the list. This movie is just a good time.If Psycho was a person, and its fun, creepy atmosphere was its skin, and Anthony Perkins was its face I guess, Its structure would be a crazy adamantite skeleton and its pacing? Well, synthetic cyborg muscles of course. For a horror film to maintain the feeling it needs to keep its viewers attention in the events leading up to the scares, it needs to have a solid setup for the plot that goes on long enough for it to not feel rushed but not so overlong that it becomes boring and takes away from the impact of the scary moments it's building up to. It needs to be interesting enough to not feel like a chore, but still understand its role as a vehicle for the frightening moments in the films. The story takes a back seat to the scary stuff in a horror movie. The good ones understand this, but the best of them do it in a way that doesn't compromise the quality of the story. Psycho is a shining example of a balanced and well executed horror film narrative. It's the king of this technique. the events leading up to Marion Crane's trip to the Bates motel work exceptionally well, and her encounters with the police officers at the dealership and on the road do an amazing job of establishing the spooky feel of the film in a seamless way and work to keep the viewer interested in what's to come. The ease with which Hitchcock leads into the events that take place at the motel are a huge part of what allows him to make the film such a good time.You can't sing the praises of Psycho without applauding the incredible work Anthony Perkins does as the film's criminally insane leading man- the one and only Norman motherloving Bates. Perkins' ability to personify a person with such a severe case of dissociative identity disorder is so unbelievably good you'd think this guy went home at the end of the day and lived life as Norman Bates instead of himself. Not only does he have such an intrinsic ability to play the psycho, but he does such an impeccable job of committing Norman's crimes as well. When he sneaks up on the woman in the legendary and absolutely immortal shower scene, he does so like he was made to be a movie monster, and when he rushes in to attack the detective to the sound of Bernard Herrmann's screeching soundtrack he could scare a banana straight out of its goshdang peel. And bananas don't even have eyes or ears or even watch movies in the first place.I love this film. it's a champion of horror. In a genre where so many films can only be fun by sacrificing the scares or just by being low budget bargain bin Netflix dumpster movies, Psycho triumphs in its ability to conquer everything important to entertain horror fans. Alfred Hitchcock's talent is so palpable in this film it may just as well turn itself into a big spoonful of Bates flavored gelato and fly its way right into the brain mouths of everyone watching. Gelato only has half the calories of regular ice cream, too. You ever try it? It's like ice cream pudding. It's great. Just like this film.",10,3,4,10 November 2014
