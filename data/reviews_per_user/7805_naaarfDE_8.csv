Come and See," Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland
","COME AND SEE is a hypnotic and relentless serenade of suffering and gruesomeness. It is hardly bearable in its effect and develops a horrific maelstrom which reminded me of Paul Celan's 'Todesfuge' - you can try to escape that pull with all your strength, but it sucks you in and won't let you go.Words can barely describe what COME AND SEE feels like. It grabs you by the guts and won't let go until the credits roll and beyond. It is the perfect movie I wish would never have had to be shot and seen by anyone. But here we are. Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland.",10,2,2,17 November 2018
Akira," Reflecting on the past
","I'm not a big anime guy so up until now there are not a lot of movies I can compare AKIRA to. But with regards to the dystopian setting, GHOST IN THE SHELL is a particularly obvious comparison.AKIRA does not feel as tight as Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece but they are definitely on par in terms of profoundness. While GHOST IN THE SHELL ponders what could be, Katsuhiro Otomo's movie reflects on the past - especially japanese history - and toys with elements of surrealism to bridge the gap between between the sociological and philosophical layers of the movie.",7,0,0,3 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A giant 'nudge nudge, wink wink'-fest
","BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY trips, falls and fails the exact second Freddie plays a few notes of Bohemian Rhapsody while laying with Mary beneath the piano, saying 'It has potential'. And at that point there are still a full two hours of movie left.Queen's history is full of stories worth telling, instead BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY is one giant 'nudge nudge, wink wink'-fest. But you've got to admit that the Wembley-sequence is pretty stand-out.",5,1,5,3 February 2019
Bird Box," A wannabe A QUIET PLACE
","BIRD BOX is a wannabe A QUIET PLACE - but instead of effectively and coherently establishing the rules of it's world, the script makes them up randomly along the way. There are hardly any scenes in which the impending conesquences are palpable. It's never clear what's actually at stake.",5,1,2,3 February 2019
Cold War," As beautiful and touching as it is tragic and heartbreaking
","The backdrop of COLD WAR has it's origins in a society whose culture has been quite literally bombed into nirvana. The story picks up at a time when the most resilient remains are beeing scraped together.It depicts two sides, both of which are trying to instrumentalize the few surviving flower blossoms - one for good, the love of art, cultural heritage and a form of artistic patriotism. The other one for evil, political gain and brainwashing propaganda. And two lovers are caught in the midst of it.COLD WAR portrays art as enduring, yet as fragile and pure as love (and vice versa). A love that needs to be preserved and nurtured with all one's strength and cannot be forced.The film reminds me in it's unfolding of Richard Linklater's BEFORE trilogy - love just meant to be and doomed to fail at the same time. It's as beautiful and touching as it is tragic and heartbreaking.",9,3,8,3 December 2018
Raging Bull," Seems somewhat indecisive
","RAGING BULL is less a sports film than a study of physical and psychological violence, privilege, entitlement and abuse.It's interesting to see the work of a matured filmmaker headed for GOODFELLAS while the Sturm und Drang of MEAN STREETS still shines through. At the same time, it feels like Scorsese is a tad lost. He tries to go for something else but doesn't quite know how to get there without the Mafia. In the context of his filmography, Scorsese seems somewhat indecisive.",7,1,1,1 March 2020
Green Book," I am not racist because I have a black friend.
","It is never directly spelled out but certainly heavily implied:Tony Lip: 'Hey Doc, we're both marginalized - me because I am not highly educated and you because you're discriminated against and have to fear for your life just because of the colour of your skin. EMPATHY! Oh, and I am not racist because I have a black friend.'",5,4,8,1 March 2020
Jackie Brown," Lacks Tarantino's edge
","Everything about JACKIE BROWN is cool and smooth - the acting, cinematography, direction, music, writing. But maybe that's the problem. Even though the movie is obviously very good, it lacks Tarantino's edge and does not really try to swing big. It feels like a safe-bet version of PULP FICTION.",7,0,3,3 February 2019
