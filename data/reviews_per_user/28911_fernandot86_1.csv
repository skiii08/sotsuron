Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It depends on the age you see it for the first time.
","I was 12 and it it was pure magic... when i was around 7, I watched the empire strikes back in an old theater, and it made my little mind blow, I was delighted by that world, but I didn't find any toys in that moment, so I made them.. some clay miniatures... I had walkers, TIE figthers, X-wings, blasters, ETC,. When this movie went out, it made my imagination fly again, I loved and laughed at Jar JaR (even tho I found him annoying after my adult mind set it), so, its a 10/10 movie for my 12 year old mind, I think if I saw it for the first time right now i might hate it, but it brings so many memories and good feelings that I have watched it, at least once every year since 1999, 10+ times,,",10,4,6,27 December 2019
