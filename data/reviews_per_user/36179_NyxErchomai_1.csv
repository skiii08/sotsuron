The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," If You Don't Like Twilight, Don't Go
","The Twilight Saga film adaptations have all previously left something to be desired and it was for this reason that I initially didn't want to go and be disappointed with Breaking Dawn. However, after going and seeing it, I was thoroughly surprised by the movie.Let me first say that while I am a fan of the Twilight Saga books I have, up until now, not been a very large fan of the movies. Breaking Dawn Part 1 has served to alter this slightly.Of the two hours that I sat in the cinema, I was only annoyed three times by deviations from the book. I won't list these (they'd spoil things), but as far as book-to-film adaptations go, making only three proper – but not unnecessary – changes is quite a feat.The splitting of the book into two films was, in my opinion, an excellent idea. It made it possible to have all of the details in the movie, all of the plot points and little nuances that help to fully develop a story. The movie could have been shortened though, as it began to drag a little bit in places.As far as the acting went, I was also pleasantly surprised. Kristen Stewart is not known for her large range of emotions, but I was glad to see a few smiles, laughter, fear, surprise, anger and even adoration. Her acting has stepped up a notch (perhaps not a very big one though) and the rest of the cast were just as commendable, if not more so.The cinematography was good; there were some beautiful island scenes, a sun over the mountains, a beautiful wedding scene – in fact, there was only one instance when the camera work annoyed me, when it constantly shifted between two faces during a conversation, quickly becoming repetitive and a little dizzying.The music was well chosen too, and I particularly liked the use of Bella's Lullaby by Carter Burwell in one of the final scenes of the movie. I never felt like the music was taking anything away from the scene, or that it was overdone.Overall, I give the movie an 8 out of 10 because as far as Young Adult book adaptations go, this one was the best I've seen so far; the acting was better than I expected it to be, the ending was perfect, the camera work was well-done, the music was endearing and I left the cinema wishing that I could turn right around and watch it again. However, it could have been shorter or faster-paced, and looking neutrally, certain scenes were slightly awkward, long-winded or unnecessary.As a semi-Twilight fan I liked the movie, but I have to add that unless you go into the cinema looking for the good, you won't find anything to like about Breaking Dawn Part 1.",9,1,10,11 December 2011
