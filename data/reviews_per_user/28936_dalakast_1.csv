The Avengers," The Avengers - Your character defines your point of view.
","Living in a world of more than 7 billion people, one must consider this as a critical fact, without trying to counter-argue for any reason whatsoever: the diversity in opinions can be unimaginably huge.And what is the reason for this? What are the main variables that are to be held responsible for someone's opinions? Well, there is the environment we grow up & live in, for two big ones, with all their subcategories, like the people that surround us and their beliefs of any kind. If you grow up, for example, in a family that values honesty, they'll probably push you into becoming an honest being. If you grow up in a family that enjoys watching comedies in their free time, you'll probably grow a 'thing' for comedies later on in your life - no matter how attracted you may become to other genres of movies, a comedy will always be something you enjoy for various reasons, the remembrance of your happy family moments for one.Let's say you're a fan of Sci-Fi movies. You most likely grew up watching such and you've definitely been taken your breath away by certain 'classics', as we call them nowadays, that left you with some kind of a mental mark about how awesome they were. Alien, for instance. A totally breath-taking Horror film, a masterpiece for it's kind, it's era. So, to my point: It is wrong to compare any new film to the one that let you breathless. I mean, feel free to judge that what you just watched is better or worse, but you can't direct a whole review to why a movie 'rocked your world' or 'totaly sucked' based on your mental mark about your favorite movie and it's perfect, to you, characteristics, specifications & moments. Of course, there are reasons and places to do so, if for example there is an award to be given between two or more, but nothing more or less.I did enjoy The Avengers. I did enjoy the cast. I believe that Robert Downey Jr. acts in a very stylish, awesome for me way, that I might have enjoyed the movie only because I like him as Iron Man. Mark Ruffalo and Christ Hemsworth are very amusing to watch as well, their impersonations of The Hulk and Thor being incredibly amazing. Overally the cast fit their roles well-enough to create an enjoyable, rocking atmosphere that will hold you tight in place until the very end.There were plenty of moments where I was slightly disappointed, like the extreme damage and conditions that Iron Man's suit could sustain - the movie could have been better at certain points like these, but the overall experience compensated. Hey!, it's based on hardcore comic books after all, and director's Joss Whedon great attention to it's making is clearly noticeable, if you've read the comics.The movie was worth my time, and I give it a seven out of ten. I've seen a couple of better Action Sci-Fi movies, matter of personal preference, and there always must be place for even better ones, since human capabilities can't be imagined. Thus, a seven from me to The Avengers, makes this Action Sci-Fi a must-see to those that agree with me. An outstanding production.",7,3,7,27 September 2012
