Captain Phillips," One of the best films i've ever scene
","I went to see this film with a group of friends, there wasn't much else on and so we had to compromise and watch this.We expected an average film due to it being only at sea, we were completely wrong, it is a unique film which captures flawlessly the harsh reality of modern day piracy and provides an exciting and tense atmosphere throughout. The acting was perfect and Tom Hanks and the director both did amazing jobs. The film reminded me of 127 hours but a bigger and better version.One of the best films i've ever seen, well worth the money and i will undoubtedly be going to see this again soon.",9,0,4,23 October 2013
