Resident Evil: Afterlife," More of a matrix than a resident evil...
","right for starters i gave it a 5 because it seemed unfinished and rushed.. the film was like a matrix with a few monsters.. the boss looked like one of the matrix guys full of really slow fighting scenes but nothing really gets going.. through half film they focus on some big guy with a axe hammer like he's gna cause some trouble... he did for bout 1 minute!!! and that was that... not a lot of killing of zombies and not really a lot about the virus.. as i said the film was rushed and ending was awful... sorry to spoil it but their will be another resident evil fo sure.. and tbh i don't think i could watch it. it has really spoilt the series for me.. to narrow it down..... EACH TO THEIR OWN, DEFINTLY WORTH A WATCH IF YOUR INTO RESIDENT EVIL BUT Don't EXSPECT IT TO BE A AMAZING .",5,0,2,8 October 2010
