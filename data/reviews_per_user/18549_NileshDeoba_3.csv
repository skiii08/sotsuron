10 Cloverfield Lane," An attention gripping plot that had me guessing the whole way throughout.
","10 Cloverfield Lane was an amazing thriller continuing the film before. I did not expect the reviews when they came in. I knew it had to be good reviews, but they were better than good. I had no problems with it really except it didn't....I'm not going to spoil it. John, Mary, and John G. did very well.",8,0,0,12 June 2020
The Hills Have Eyes," One of the best horror remakes to come out in this most recent trend.
","One word: Brutal! If you take the story in to account, this is actually a quality horror film. Greatest horror movie ever created. A horror movie is supposed to make you feel disgusted and disturbed. This movie does all of that and better.",9,2,2,12 June 2020
It Follows," Failed to pursue an interesting story
","Truly boring right to the very end, when we went 'wait, what, that's the end?'",5,1,1,12 June 2020
