Alien 3," A different take on the same beast..
",I saw this at the cinema upon release going into the cinema with no expectations.. Coming from David Fincher who I'd not known of at the time I didn't know what to expect.. It has a very mixed cast with the best of British including the amazing Charles Dance and Pete Postlethwaite and Ralph Brown and Paul McGann.. With Lance Henriksen and Charles S Dutton from the States. Personally I loved this movie it has everything you could possibly want from an Alien movie. The films tension is always first and foremost and keeps you on your toes. I mean you know what to expect but this movie does it all on its own and stands out from the Alien franchise. The script is very good and the fact that it's pretty much lead by an English cast makes it that much better. For me it has everything you could want from an Alien movie and I'd like to point out that the films soundtrack is amazing by Elliot Goldenthal and it was his first mainstream score and it really stands out. I think that the franchise should of finished with this movie but unfortunately we have Alien Resurrection to follow this..To finish I have very fond memories of this movie and always watch it when it's on. I used to have the whole film on tape cassette which I listened to over and over as a teenager. Probably why I know the film word for word.. Absolutely love it..,9,2,3,21 April 2020
