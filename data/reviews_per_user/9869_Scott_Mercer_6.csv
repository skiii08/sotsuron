Sucker Punch," Suckered, Punched
","This film encapsulates almost everything wrong with the state of high-concept, blockbuster, CGI-laden filmmaking these days.To wit: bad writing, bad acting, nonsensical story, bad mixtures of fantasy and reality, over reliance on computer graphics.But hey, the music was cool! Not even sure if this film could have been saved with better writing, better casting, better acting, better directing. The whole idea is just so flawed at its foundation.Fantasy sequences, within fantasy sequences, within dream sequences. Muddled to the point where, honestly, who cared? If the 'reality' sequences in the mental hospital, the first few scenes, had been a little less stylized, I might have bumped it up a few points. Reality can be drab, and should be somewhat drab especially in a mental hospital in a non-specific past time. However, the drab reality of the mental hospital setting was equally stylized and comic-book like as the ballet school/jail/nightclub/whorehouse, or whatever it was supposed to be.And that just turned the whole movie into a mess.And what does the title even MEAN? It could have been called FLIGHTS OF FANCY, or HELL HOLE, or BRAIN DRAIN, or FIGHT TO BE FREE, or YOU HAVE ALL THE WEAPONS YOU NEED, or any one of many other titles that would have been WAY more appropriate.But I will give it a 3 for the extremely competent CGI work and the great music choices. The fact that those choices were in service of a really bad idea means that I can't possibly go any higher than that.",3,5,10,20 October 2013
Interstellar," Overrated
","I can't knock the look of the film and the excellence of the special effects, but the script was just too long and flabby. It was like 2001: A Space Odyssey as directed by M. Night Shymalan. This is a problem you sometimes get where the director and the writer are the same person. Nolan is just too in love with his own script and can't possibly bring himself to make the tough editing choices that need to be made. I could have cut almost a full hour from this film and made it much better. And somebody should have. And yet, among the long stretches of the film that drag and are boring, there are a few parts that feel ignored and rushed.The 'ghost' subplot was just too predictable and hacky, something that Shymalan would have put into one of his movies, while patting himself on the back for his extreme cleverness. McConnaughey doesn't take too many chances here. While he brought welcome humanity to a cold movie, this is familiar territory for him. Anne Hathway was fine. Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine were excellent. I should also bring up the difficulties with the sound mix, causing important dialog to be difficult to understand. Hans Zimmer's omnipresent, throbbing, overdone score was like a party guest that would not leave long after he had become unwelcome.Overall, not terrible but really overrated.",4,4,8,18 November 2014
Southpaw," Didn't Believe One Second Of It
","Hackneyed, overcooked screenplay that showcases not real people, but memes stolen from other, better movies. Not credible hogwash where things happen that can't happen in real life, but only in Hollywoodland. Not a story, but a collection of clichés done hundreds of times before, and done better each time.If no other reason, naming your protagonist in your boxing movie 'Hope' when the cliché 'Great White Hope' has been around the boxing world since my grandfather was watching bouts. That right there should be an automatic disqualification. That just slaps the audience in the face with the idea that you think they're stupid.Weird directing choices with distracting use of odd close-ups that make no sense. Acting choices that emphasize the pre-fab, cardboard cutout nature of the characters.Overbearing soundtrack which is annoying.I'm only giving it a 2 instead of a one since the Cinematographer did an okay job.STAY. AWAY.",2,3,4,8 January 2016
The Mist," They Made Lots of Mist Takes To Make This Movie
","Does injecting what is essentially a B-level monster movie format with more refined and sublime concerns such the nature of death, the existence (or not) of God and the destructive aspect of religion elevate the B-level monster movie to something a little more significant, or degrade the high-toned philosophical musings into a mere gimmick employed to spice up a crappy monster movie? The answer in the case of Frank Darabont's 'The Mist' is a little bit of both, unfortunately. It was an admirable attempt, in the tradition of the best episodes of 'The Twilight Zone.' Is the monster that creepy thing outside, or is the monster ourselves? Rod Serling was a master at writing set-ups like that, and making them believable...to the point where they still hold up to this day. Like I said, I appreciate the attempt to inject that kind of refinement into a silly monster movie. However, in this case, it just doesn't work. Why not? I guess because that aspect was a little too heavy-handed, overwritten, and overacted. If everyone had just dialed everything back just a LITTLE bit, I would have been prepared to give this movie an 8.As far as the ending goes, I understand that some of the other commenter were bothered by its seemingly nihilistic tone with no reason. On this point, I must disagree. What happened at the end of the film made complete sense to me, with what I knew about the characters and where the story had gone up to that point. Too bad that movies like this can't have their endings left up the air in today's movie marketplace, and most must have a 'surprise twist' ending. I breathed a sigh of relief that the big surprise twist wasn't anything STUPID, like it was all a dream or something like that. But I still shake my head that some sort of 'ironic twist' was required, and the film makers couldn't leave it open-ended, like Stephen King did in his novella.Still in all, it was a good idea and Darabont builds everything up well, tension is thick, and the CGI monsters are well scary.The other major reason I cannot give this film more than a 5 is that it is a total ripoff of the no-budget stinker 'The Slime People' from 1962. It has the exact same set-up of people trapped in a grocery store while nasty beasties are outside, wandering around in a fog that has enveloped everything. Never mind Carpenter's 'The Fog,' this one is the true wellspring. Not saying that King actively grabbed his story from a creaky old black and white movie. But everyone knows that sometimes certain things remain stuck in your brain for years until they pop up again for no reason: things you didn't remember you remembered. What I am saying is that King probably grabbed most of the story from 'The Slime People' on a subconscious level. It was shown on TV many times during the time King was growing up. If you don't believe me on this point, please check out the reviews of 'The Slime People' and you will see how right I am.",5,1,4,14 February 2010
The Longest Day," Bad Presentation
","I had the misfortune of watching this film last night on the AMC cable channel. Don't do it! I should have known better, because I know how AMC handles their product, but it was late at night and nothing else was on the tube but infomercials.The channel showed this widescreen film pan-and-scan, which is an abomination, first and foremost. Then, secondly, they interrupt the film for a commercial break every 5 to 7 minutes! Agghh! I will grant that the commercial breaks were not that long (2-4 minutes), but, when dealing with a film that is 3 hours long, and has such an epic scope, these frequent interruptions become trying pretty quickly. These frequent interruptions are less irksome when AMC shows Hollywood fluff like action films or comedies (anything with Eddie Murphy comes to mind), which, also, are much shorter, but with an intense, long, epic film like this, they rise to the level of maddening soon enough.I have to say, I stuck with the film since I was over an hour into it and wanted to see it through to the end, but I did so through clenched teeth, and finally went to bed in the wee hours.The film itself is pretty great. Yes, in a way, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has trumped its beach landing scenario with film-making that seems both more realistic and more modern. But this was state-of-the-art epic Hollywood craftsmanship in 1962, and the subject befits this sweeping, epic approach. Such an amazing topic that the idea of not delving into the characters' personal lives, thoughts or dreams, is an appropriate one in this case. I'm not a John Wayne fan at all, but okay, he's not seen here too much (nobody is) and he does a decent enough job. What I did object to was stunt casting of musicians Paul Anka and Fabian, even if they too had brief roles. They're not so good.Overall, I recommend this film, but get it on DVD, do not watch it on AMC.",8,1,4,27 April 2008
Identity," A Shameful Betrayal
","I must go against the tide of opinion here. Those people rating this film highly have to be deranged. This film represents exactly the wrong way to write a movie and goes against everything I've ever read about screenplay structure and application. The filmmakers of 'Identity' have broken a sacred bond with us, the audience. They have betrayed us.*** SPOILERS!!! *** One of the cardinal rules of (successful) screenplay writing is to make the audience care about the characters. In this, all the actors do a bang-up job. Some really good casting here and I can't fault any of the actors, who all deliver excellent performances (even Amanda Peet, appropriately screechy here) except maybe the guy playing Malcolm.But, 3/4 of the way through the film, the rug is yanked out from under us, and the audience is stabbed in the back. Everything we have been watching is not real, not even within the fictional construct of the film's artificial universe. None of the characters exist, the hotel doesn't exist, nobody was really killed, even the rain is false. Nothing that happens has made any sense, or needed to make any sense, because we have been watching the mindscape of an unappealing psychotic serial killer, not real people that the director and actors have tricked us into caring about.When we, as audience members, enter a film screening, we are making an informal agreement between ourselves and the filmmakers, that we will suspend our disbelief, and, in turn, the filmmakers are going to provide us characters we can empathize with (or hate, if they are the villains), and a responsibly constructed story line that follows certain storytelling conventions. Identity changes the rules in the middle of the game! It's like going to watch a football game, only to be told half way through, sorry, this wasn't really a football game, it was really a BALLET about a football game.Yes, I know there were some clues as to what was really happening presented right at the outset. But the fact that everything we were watching at the hotel didn't really exist was certainly hidden from us for far too long, until the only option remaining was that the whole thing was a dream or hallucination of some kind. This was not a clever puzzle, or an enchanting riddle for the audience to solve. This was a cheat, flat out. Straight up.And shame on you, Mr. Cooney, and Mr. Mangold, for cheating your audience. It's one thing to pull a magic trick on your audience through the subtle art of misdirection. It's another to con them out of the price of a movie ticket or DVD. The old Bait and Switch in action. There's a reason why magicians get paid highly to perform, but hucksters and con men are thrown in prison.Honestly, I am shocked that so many people rated this film so highly. If you really did enjoy this film, try the grade-Z cheapie Monster-A-Go-Go from 1965 (it's available on DVD), and tell me how much you enjoyed the ending of that film, another 'mindblowing twist' that clubs us over the head with the fact that we just wasted our time watching what is a non-movie. If you people enjoy watching a movie that figuratively stabs you in the back, then I can't do anything to help you. But personally, I want my money back.",1,20,41,12 March 2007
