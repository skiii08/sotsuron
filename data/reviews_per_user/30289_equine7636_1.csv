Marie Antoinette," If you were interested enough to come to this site and read a review, this movie is for you!
","I thought it was a very well put together movie. It wasn't the typical dark period film with horrible acting; on the contrary, it was aesthetically amazing, and portrayed how I somewhat think life in Versaille really was- obviously there were modern clichÃ©s thrown in, and the directors own interpretation, and I don't mean to say it was historically accurate (I neither know nor care if it was), but it shows the gilt surroundings and the leisure time very well. It is perhaps a bit drawn out, but you're so distracted by the prettiness of all the scenes that it doesn't seem to bother most people. If you don't have an interest in history, you may not like it as much. Likewise, if you have are a stickler for accurate films you may not like it.There was amazing acting. The script maybe left a little more to be desired vocally, but Dunst managed to portray every feeling in a glance- the last scene in particular. The ending itself.. was a surprise. When it cut to the credits the theater resounded with 'What's?', but it was still a good movie.",8,1,5,24 October 2006
