Blade Runner 2049," I'm sure there's meaning somewhere
","It's hard to write a review when you can't stay awake through the whole thing. But I guess that's its own comment. I loved the first one and was excited for this one. But after watching it a few times I still remember almost nothing about it. It literally puts me to sleep every time. I guess Gosling is trying to play a wooden emotionless replicant but he just comes off as bored. The whole pace is slow. It's difficult to remember why we're supposed to care. It has none of the energy, emotion, or urgency of the original. I'll just add that being a huge fan of Vangelis' original score, the music here was sorely disappointing.",4,3,6,14 October 2018
First Man," Well done, but not for me
","I am not a fan of topical Hollywood movies. I like brooding dramas and think pieces. This movie should have been right up my alley. But I could not stay awake through it, and don't really feel the need to see what I missed. I find Ryan Gosling to be very wooden when he tries to do drama, so maybe that's what tuned me out. If you're looking for an exciting movie this is not it. If you want a good historical drama and have a cup of coffee, it may suit you.",4,1,1,7 October 2019
Pearl Harbor," A perfect example of what's wrong with Hollywood
","Michael Bay has always been known for style over substance, which is fine if you're doing Donny Osmond videos. But he should not be allowed near any serious subject matter. He lacks the talent and sensitivity to tell stories. He is a one trick pony, whose one trick is neither interesting, nor original.There is nothing wrong with cheesy action movies and bad love stories. Many people enjoy them. But the subject matter, budget, and talent are all completely wasted on this disaster. Apparently Mr Bay could not find anything compelling about one of the most important events in American history, instead using the war as merely the backdrop for one of the worst love stories ever inflicted on an audience.Do yourself a favor, fast forward to the battle scenes and don't waste any more minutes of your life on the rest of this clich√©d, uninteresting train wreck of a movie.",1,0,2,5 June 2015
