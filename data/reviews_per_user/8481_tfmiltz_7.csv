The Monuments Men," Should have been called the Men Who DIDN'T Stare at Goats
","I didn't see any goats in this movie at ALL.I do not recommend this movie to anyone for entertainment value.There might be some historical value here, but that's about it.I saw the cast line up and was thrilled. I expected more than cheap plugs at Stripes with Bill Murray.I expected more from George Clooney than this happy go lucky ring leader looking for a lost puppy meanwhile he's a Giraffe, not a dog, and possibly not even a Giraffe at that. One thing for sure is he REALLY stuck his neck out on this one.One thing I did find interesting in this movie is I couldn't tell Matt Damon and the Darfur guy - Anegelie's husband, Pitt, Brad Pitt, I couldn't tell Pitt and Damon apart which was kind of interesting at the least. But short of a guessing game as to who was Damon and who was Pitt ? I couldn't follow this movie at all.Just one scene after another after another disconnected.The IDEA was terrific, I'm SURE it sounded GREAT when run by the actors but somewhere ? This wasn't a perfect storm, there was no Saddam's Gold, and there were no goats.I'm currently still in therapy from this movie, I expect it will take another 90 days to undo the damage.And I didn't even make it beyond 50%.Watch for HISTORICAL VALUE ONLY - but get yourself a GOOD psychiatrist FIRST before watching this movie and LET THEM KNOW you will be watching it- they probably have a new designer drug out JUST for this movie by now... The Cloonazapram... Good luck.",1,5,9,4 May 2014
Lone Survivor," Nice Chevron commercial
","I give this movie 2 stars only because I reserve 1 star for the actual REAL US presence in Afghanistan. At the end of the day ? it didn't do a thing for US foreign policy short of generate more anti-US sentiment and leave families in these regions wondering why their loved ones were killed by drunk renta-soldiers from Defense Intelligence Agencies Whackenhut rentals, or the Predators in the northern tribal regions of Wazyristan, or Kazakhstan (to this very DAY Jan 11th 2014). To those who confuse 9/11 WTC attacks with Afghanistan, the pilots were Saudis. Usama Bin Laden was a Saudi. This piece of propaganda really takes it over the top with the emotional manipulation through acoustics, somehow ? making you feel 'good' watching people blow each other to kingdom come.The Taliban was invited to Sugarland Texas in 1999 - and they came. Cheney of Halliburton as well as what is now Chevron asked if they would be a problem for the Kazakhstan-Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline. The Taliban opted NOT to take Chevron's money. The Taliban didn't just show up overnight hating America, no, corporate oil provoked these people. This movie is a commercial for Chevron period.I have to seriously wonder who funded it. A movie showing that Pat Tillman was killed by friendly fire and that the US Department of Defense covered it up and Bush ? ironically USED Tillman's death to rally support FOR Afghanistan.In so many ways Tillman's death may very well have paved the road for these unfortunate souls to even find themselves in the hills of Afghanistan with rattlesnakes and tribal elders armed with ground to ground stinger missiles provided by Casey era CIA.There is a HIGH probability the ground to ground missiles being used as depicted in this film would have been provided by the US CIA in a different era, and era where the very men here being painted as evil ? Were actually allies and used by Reagan, Bush, Casey era. I do not recommend watching this rally around the flag garbage. In no was did US presence in Afghanistan help matters, if anything ? There is now an entire generation that only can know the United States as if it's there to blow peoples heads off. DoD should have had US troops building schools, and protecting them, we'd have an entire generation now of kids nearly 12 years old - young adults - who would have a very positive view on the world, including the United States. So ironic that in Sugarland Texas ? The Taliban expressed they didn't want western oil money, they just wanted schools, roads and power lines. This movie fails to value life first before ideology. The only thing worse than this movie is the truth - and that is- US presence in Afghanistan was about securing the IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW - Kazakhstan- Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline. It seems over 200 BILLION barrels of oil have been validated in Kazakhstan. That's 20 trillion dollars at $100 a barrel. 20 trillion dollars is enough to 'just have to get elected in 2000'. It's all oil - and this movie fails to show how human lives have been disrespected on ALL sides here - all in the name of power. With 20 trillion dollars ? You could buy the next 100 US presidencies, in fact ? ALL land mortgage contracts in the United States used to total only 12 trillion before the regulatory failures - the FBI financial crimes unit warned the Bush White House admin of the forthcoming mortgage crisis and they opted to do nothing about it, in fact, Bush took over 500 FBI FC unit agents and put them on 'terror' assignment. The money to be harvested in adjacent Kazakhstan ? is enough to buy the ENTIRE United States over TWICE. These Navy Seals are as brainwashed as the North Koreans. They haven't figured out they're just RENTED by the oil corporations. If it wasn't for what is now Chevron ? We wouldn't have had WTC attacks. Cheney threatened to destroy the Taliban in 1999. It seems he found his excuse through WTC.And in the end ? ISI who the CIA was been doing business with for some time ? turns out to be housing Usama Bin Laden in a nice abode in Pakistan under ISI protection. Too bad the US Naval Intelligence command couldn't get BETTER intel from the CIA. Clearly Porter Goss could care LESS about US Navy renta-seals.US should have been building schools and protecting the next generation to break the religious extremist's hold on the next generation. I sense in the West the extreme Christian right is analog to the Taliban.The absolute worst would be would be if there is some pro Christian message in this movie. So far, I've not seen any. Remember, former CEO of former Blackwater Erik Prince stated Blackwater's contracting with the DIA and DOD was a 'crusade for Christ'. It doesn't get much sicker than that. I PRAY religion isn't part of the US Navy Seals morning rituals, seeing it on Alaska Gold Rush and US Marines in Iraq is short of wondering who's been brainwashed more into a phony pretense of a religious war. At the end of the day the LAST thing you want to see US presence in Iraq OR Afghanistan turn into is a religious war. Who knows, maybe that's why the 'war on terror' just seems - misdirected. Perhaps OTHER than oil profiteering and abuses of third world nations driving it ? Perhaps there really ARE people who decorate the conflict in religious context.",2,20,45,11 January 2014
Interstellar," Cars, Oil, Nationalism and Children of the Corn IX
","Let's seePlanet Earth is virtually unlivable- where ALL you can grow is corn, BUT - people drive around in automobiles - Awe SHUCKS HONEY - the dust storm is comin' and the GAS STATION is CLOSED ! Awe shucks. Those magic oil corporations must be making gas behind the scenes in this movie. Who made this heap of hubris propaganda? Hmm- given a choice... hmm - work with the planet you have or? Leave it- go through a wormhole - go have a fist fight with Matt Damon on Ice Planet - realize that you're not STILL not going to fix the leak in human ethics that will lead to exploiting a new planet EVEN IF you find one, or ? hmm... keep working on the planet you live on, and realize chances are you probably CAN grow more than corn if you put your intellect to it.Better: 'Damn it honey, we can figure out how to turn the entire facility into a space ship, we can figure out how to go through a worm hole, we can figure out how to repopulate a planet with 10,000 human embryos grown from eggs in a lab - but damn it - we just can't figure out how to grow anything but corn !'This movie should be banned in ALL 195 countries.It's in part an oil advertisement in disgusie - a bit of Go USA propaganda - I'm surprised there wasn't something for Israel or against Iran in it, they did bring in element of dust storm though. But ain't no corn in Iran. Well MAYBE. Human ancestors have records going back to 13,000 B.C. in Iran's Zagros mountains- I somehow think our ancestors were able to figure out how to grow MORE THAN CORN in a DESERT ENVIRONMENT - gee- you'd think we can too!.The only thing that could have made this movie worse was if Ben Affleck was in it - they probably just edited him out.I keep waiting for Malakye to show up from Children of the Corn, this could be a real treat if it goes that direction.Two Matts in one movie- REAL BAAAAYAD IDEA - both offer up the same generic - character - they always play. As for Matthew Mcconaughey? Even 25 years of rock solid alcohol and meth use won't help him forget this nightmare.This movie should have you wondering one thing - WHY ARE THEY DRIVING AROUND IN Co2 producing AUTOMOBILES - Why the American flag on McMcMc HOWEVER YOU SPELL THAT NAME - Matt brought more talent naked in front of bongos when he was arrested than in this production.Do yerself a favor- just go watch Children of the Corn I through XIII (You have to enumerate the first one, and last 3 yourself, but you get the idea) instead of this, THAT or put 2001 Space Odyssey on fast forward and overlay South Park's Wild Wild West song with Cartman singing:Well, I'm a badass Cowboy livin' in the Cowboy days. Wiggy, wiggy, scratch, yo, yo, bang, bang. Me and Artemus Clyde frog go save Salma Hayek from the big metal spider. A wiggy wig wig wiggy wiggy wig Fresh cowboy from the west side Wiggy wiggy scratch yo yo bang bang Me and Artemus Clyde frog go save Salma frog polly prissy pants Go down to, well... rumpletumpskin",1,3,7,10 April 2015
Everest," Why do people do this?
","I just don't understand.First people willfully put their lives at risk- pushing it further and further and then when something happens? you are supposed to say?'real bright idea jackass, why not descend into a volcano next?'People place their lives in danger repeatedly trying to climb Everest and when something goes wrong? They act like the 'mean ole mountain got em', no, more like that jackass who decided to place their life in danger for bragging rights is the culprit.Climbing Everest ties into self-esteem I suppose.I just don't get it.Who NEEDS to say they climbed Everest ? In general, Vegans will tell you they are a Vegan before anything else'Hi, I'm Bob, and I'm a Vegan'you never hear'Hi, I'm Larry, I eat pork, and chicken but not beef'Usually people just HAVE to tell you they are taking Yoga lessons tooEverest isn't too far behind Yoga lessons.",1,18,33,3 November 2015
War Machine," Why no Oscar for Brad Pitt
","There is a delicate line between satire and demonstrating a brutal statement about a pointless war.All I know is, not once did I ever think 'This is Brad Pitt' that USUALLY only happens with Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino...McMahon really sums up some blind optimism - this movie had me reminding myself underneath any uniform, is a human being. Period.No temporary political ideology can rob us of our humanity that came down polished for hundreds of thousands of years - not some 300 year half baked end of day it's corporatism ANYHOO political ideology.The only thing missing from this - that could have made it a 10 would have been presence of Enron.For Enron played a great part in US occupation of Iraq. All goes back to Sugarland Texas when the Taleban was invited by now Chevron - if they were going to be a problem with the Enron planned Turkmenistan natural gas pipeline.Looks like they said they would be- and they did.Enron also just 'happened' to be the #1 campaign contributor to the Bush and Cheney 2000 campaign.Twelve Monkeys was a fun role for Brad Pitt no doubt but I think this is his best performance to date. Me? I would have liked see an Oscar for Pitt on this one.This movie can be watched many many times for some precious scenes.'Ya see - it's like raising a child - you need two parents''Woodward ? OH NO ''Steps to freedom - you familiar with the moon landing? 'I do so wonder how this movie might have come across had it been released in 2004. Let's all hope there won't need to be a sequel, but the way things are going in Afghanistan - there might need to be a sequel to this movie. Ugh",9,5,9,22 June 2018
Limitless," Fun adventure movie but unrealistic and misleading
","The first time I saw this, I thought, wow, this is real neat.Then I started to think about it's message.That the key to your success and bringing out your best is 'outside' you - in a pill.Jerry Garcia once said this of Western medicine, that you are told the solution is outside you, in a pill.I think it's a poor message for younger adults to say, it's all the pill ! Not you.I'd much rather have someone who maybe - meditates and finds a place in themselves they can draw on for equal intellectual feats as seen in this movie.The movie opens up first scene showing him disheveled, saying 'For someone who doesn't have a drug or alcohol problem, who looks like this - a writer is who'Well he's smoking a cigarette - there is your drug problem and the very next scene he's at a bar drunk - sitting at the bar slamming beers, and there is your alcohol problem right there.I'd even argue alcohol IS A drug, in fact, this entire movie promotes substance abuse.Fun watch, but keep in mind the message isn't a good one.",4,1,4,2 June 2019
