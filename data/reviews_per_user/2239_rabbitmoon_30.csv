Insidious: Chapter 2," Better than expected for sequel, but loses the magic of the first
","The first felt like a complete film - the dynamics between the main couple were interesting, there was a tension that gave depth and emotion to the horror element. The performances and atmosphere were properly attended to and it all worked.In the sequel, the performances, characters and emotional depth are discarded in favour of over-cooking the narrative. It plays out like a TV movie (shot on DV) of something like American Horror Story, where story elements, jump moments and historical causes fly thick and fast.There are too many references to other haunted house films and clichés, The Shining and Psycho. Those latter references (which are extremely blatant) make you wish you were watching a 'real' film of that calibre, and only serve to highlight how amateur feeling this whole thing is. Leigh Whannels script, whilst over excited does have some nice touches (as well as clunkers), but James Wan's direction felt totally uninspired and rushed this time around.",5,1,2,18 September 2013
It," Starts well but gets boring fast once you realise there is no goal
","The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoon Netflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to the story, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless and drifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film. Its OK - but it really isn't the classic that people are making out to be. Its been incredibly over-hyped. I personally found Insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller.",6,252,448,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Terrific chiller with great direction & attention to detail, but comes with a WARNING!
","Non-spoiler warning: do not see this film if you are grieving the loss of a mother, daughter or younger sister. Any recent grievances actually would be a bad thing to take into the film. It deals with them in a very unsettling, emotionally turbulent way. The film itself is a masterfully directed horror. If you're bored of Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle, Ouija style flashy jump-scare movies and prefer your horror more subtle and considered (e.g. The Babadook, The VVitch, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, arguably Killing of a Sacred Deer) then you'll relish Hereditary.What I love most about Hereditary is its firm footing in emotional family dynamics. The strained relationships form a solid backbone for the more eerie elements, and are often just as unsettling to watch and think about. In some ways I wish it had pushed this side more, as I like it when cinema has something interesting to say about humanity. As a horror though its very effective, and a terrific addition to those lists of 'what's your favourite horror?' that do the rounds regularly.",9,3,5,28 June 2018
Wind River," Its good - but VERY clichéd under its veil of self-importance
","Wind River almost suffocates under the weight of its self-importance - characters mumbling, most lines being a little over-cooked in their meaning, characters seeming a bit too contrived and self- conscious, a context that keeps throwing its metaphor at you. But once you cut through all that, you'll find a very clichéd, often sexist genre film complete with a moody, understated male hero, a rookie female FBI agent who basically looks pretty and needs rescuing, a couple of action scenes that feel a bit like random missions from GTAV (with plenty of characters that you have only just met getting arbitrarily killed). The main flaw of the film for me is the presence of a flash-back which ultimately shouldn't be necessary, but seems completely relied upon for audience satisfaction when it comes to a villain's denouement. The villains here have no depth or causality, they exist simply as villains to further the story, but perhaps that's where the unfair treatment of native Americans comes in again. Its good - worth seeing even - but if you've seen The Grey (Neeson's character specifically), Insomnia and The Valley of Elah, your recognition neurons will be fairly active.",6,18,37,21 August 2017
Passengers," It is a joke that anyone can review this positively, who is over 14 yrs old
","Someone even called it realistic. It isn't, in any way whatsoever, realistic. It starts off like a half-baked Black Mirror idea, played by two non-charismatic, self-conscious and wooden actors, complete with lines like 'that can't be good', 'not good', 'you've gotta be kidding me'. Then the plot turns, and it becomes a rushed, silly Saturday morning cartoon. The final scene is so pithy, trite and forced, and does no justice to the story that you've just wasted two hours on. Along the way you'll see huge imitations of Alien (petal like hibernation capsules), Prometheus (medic pod), Avatar (capsule shots of Chris Pratt that are composed, shot and colour-tinted exactly like those Worthington), Gravity (untethered in space, rescued by loose cord grabbing), Sunshine (plants on a ship, watching the sun from a viewing room), The Island (a strained relationship in a sci-fi environment that gives way to stupid action), Moon (AIs that respond with smiley faces, overall environment designs, food vending machines), The Shining (the look of the bartender, the pattern on some walls matching the carpet of the Overlook Hotel). Its SO derivative, and not just because its a spaceship movie - there are direct copies and I have no idea why. A real shame of the film also is that a few very short scenes were needlessly injected purely to make the trailers look like it was some wildly inventive action film. I'm talking about the brief anti- gravity shots, particularly the swimming pool one. They're completely unnecessary in the film, last mere seconds, yet were milked like crazy in the trailer as if the last act of the film was this wild anti-gravity action thing. Its just a very, very lame film.",2,4,11,25 February 2017
Ready Player One," Often exhilerating, but caves into formula
","I haven't read the book, so am reviewing this purely as a film. Its technically incredibly accomplished - amazing CGI, a packed, detailed screen most of the time, and the 3d is brilliant (particularly the VR scenes, the real world seemed flatter/duller which may have been intentional for the same effect as Tron Legacy). The sheer dizzying vibrancy of the VR world and all its references is often joyous and refreshing.But as time goes on (and theres a lot of it) I found myself craving some substance, some humanity, some depth, character and originality which doesn't materialise. All the references to Back To The Future make me kind of wish I was watching that instead - how much more loveable the characters are in that. RP1 descends into the same formula as every other mass-market movie - evil baddie, endless destruction, slick invulnerable CGI battles, good guys in great peril, etc etc that drags on a little too long. By the end I was glad it was over, and it had lost my earlier affection. Afterwards it started dissolving fast, without much staying behind. Great entertainment, but I feel like it could have been so much more. Maybe I've been spoiled by Black Mirror. If BTTF was made now, I'm sure Biff would be a megalomaniac evil time-lord trying to destroy the spacetime contiuum, and there would be an extra hour tagged on where Biff teams up with the Libyans to destroy Hill Valley with endless CGI bazooka missiles. One thing I'll say in RP1s favour is that there is an amazing setpiece (the second key) that had me smiling so hard it was worth the price alone.",6,10,26,28 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino has absolutely forgotten how to tell a story
","Imagine this - a Tarantino fan is asked to write an eight hour season of a TV show, set in a log cabin for budget purposes. They write it, paying homage to Tarantino films in a few different ways, casting some of his usual players. They do their best to be Tarantino - there are too many self-indulgent speeches, the characters all talk the same flowery lingo, every question or fact has to be asked/given in some repetitive, distracting, and unbelievably self-conscious way. Yet, it doesn't have any of the verve or quotability of an actual Tarantino project. You eventually end up buying the DVD set of this series in a supermarket bargain bin. At home, you notice that one disc is labelled 'Deleted Scenes'. You put the disc in - check the time, and there are 180 minutes of deleted scenes. You watch them all in sequence. THAT is exactly the experience of watching The Hateful Eight.",2,123,263,31 December 2015
Molly's Game," Sorkin running himself into a slightly boring corner
","I miss the days when Aaron Sorkin put effort into writing stories, like Malice, A Few Good Men, or The American President. Sometime since, he fell so much in love with his own formula (characters delivering fast monologues involving random facts, statistics, distorting each others words into new meanings) that he doesn't seem to care about story any more. Apparently the audience will salivate and be duly aroused by yet another cutesy bit of fast-talking dialogue that could be about anything. Put simply, the story of Molly Bloom could have been told in half an hour. Heck, a 3 minute montage could have done it. Dragging it out to 2 hours 20 is just... silly. This is NOT an epic story. Its not even particularly interesting - the result has nothing in particular to do with anything. Jessica Chastain plays EXACTLY the same character as in the utter-Sorkin-imitation Miss Sloane. I was really hoping it would end soon, and there was still an hour left. Yes, Sorkins writing can be 'amusing' here and there, but most its taxing and irritating, people simply don't speak like that in real life, and it seems a real shame to let it get in the way of telling a good story. There isn't one here.",6,7,16,18 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Racist about racism
","The first half of this film is a tight, efficient, Departed/Donnie Brasco style thriller with suspense and lighter moments. Its enthralling, watchable, has some nice directorial flourishes and a fascinating context. By the second half, it descends into political spin, losing the thread of its suspense and dragging like hell. Its a strange point to make - by pushing the racism into extremes its almost like a distraction from the core human insecurity that leads to intolerance in the first place.",4,2,7,9 September 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Different and interesting at times, but distracting with its ridiculous moments
","This probably started out as a good idea. There's something fascinating about a cantankerous. outspoken kind of woman obsessing over an awful unsolved crime, and fighting the police on doing their job. Unfortunately, it ends up mixing the more occasional thoughtful, interesting moments with a ridiculously clichÃ©d portrayal of small- town police as redneck buffoons, absurd Saturday-morning-cartoon style logic, Tarantino-imitating dialogue (cutesy circular monologues where the speaker enjoys correcting themselves, overly witty for the character in question because what you're really hearing is a self-obsessed eager-to-impress screenwriter, a woman talking to herself via her slippers where every single line repetitively blurts 'm****rf****rs'), irritating un-pc humour (yeah we get it, rednecks endlessly throwing out 'n***er' and 'f***ot', child abuse, dwarfs, kicking girls in the crotch etc is so fearless and edgy!) and huge tonal shifts that ruin the moment before or after. An underlying message of the film (something about kindness being more curing than anger) gets compromised in a final scene which seems forced and against all character logic. A moment half- way through sends the core of the film in a different direction, where it could easily be retitled 'Three Letters from Ebbing, Missouri'.I haven't felt so frustrated before by the idea of less being better. If certain absolutely-unnecessary scenes, moments, lines, quips and slurs were edited out, it would be a much more efficient and powerful film. Its also awkward to see as a shared experience - audiences simply don't know how to react or respond to certain tonally uneven moments, so can't help but nervously laugh at anything they think is suggestive of humour (e.g. an innocent school girl getting needlessly kicked in the crotch by an adult woman). The protagonist is often entirely rude and ignorant in her attack monologues, but rather than sympathise with her mis-directed anger, audiences are more inclined towards 'go girl!' style moronic agreement. It just feels jarring. It Would be much better absorbed on the small screen.",5,19,36,12 December 2017
Nightcrawler," Disappointingly pedestrian, nowhere near delivers on potential
","Its an intriguing concept, and I love a good urban-night thriller (Collateral, Drive etc), but this was hugely disappointing. Here's what was wrong: - Rene Russo (as well as other actors) make it feel like a bargain basement DVD movie. I can't help but feel like she was shoe-horned into this by her husband, the writer/director. She seems just as ill-placed as she was in his other written movie, Two For The Money. The handling of her character felt awkward and unbelievable. A TV studio director being manipulated by this young, cocky loser? Its absolutely ridiculous, and it feels like Rene knows this whilst she's trying to act it out. - Jake Gyllenhaal tries his best but the character just isn't deep, nuanced or credible enough to be properly fleshed out. It all feels written, showy and trying to be clever - but annoying. The script aims for Norman Bates but comes across more like Macauley Culkin trying to buy a toothbrush in Home Alone. The character could have been played equally well (if not better) by Jared Leto, Michael Cera, or someone more up-and-coming. This is a step backward for Jake after Zodiac and Prisoners. - The story is hugely underdeveloped. Too much time is spent showing him discovering and getting into the job, as we need an 'origin' story. Why? Did we need to see Gosling become a stunt driver in Drive, or Cruise become a hit-man in Collateral? Its really boring to watch, and by the time he's fully fledged and trying to sell his videos, there's little time left to do anything interesting. There's a home invasion/shooting scene he gets to before the police, which is supposed to be some big dramatic centrepiece - except it falls flat. It could have opened with that scene, then developed into the aftermath of it in far more interesting ways than it actually does. There's no actual story here - nothing to engage with properly. - The metaphors and subtexts about voyeurism, media responsibility, moral decline etc just feel heavy handed and redundant. - The soundtrack was dull and not memorable, which is unforgivable in a film like this. Its crying out for a decent atmospheric soundtrack, but we get this David Cronenberg-esque blandness that makes it feel like a misguided sequel to Crash. - Writing and direction are absolutely pedestrian - there is nothing memorable or remarkable about it at all. The writing in particular is flat and underdeveloped, especially with regards to character, story development and subtext. Its watchable in a late-night obscure eighties throwaway kind of way, but unengaging. It certainly doesn't deserve the hype that its marketing and buzz is creating - its a sheep in wolves clothing.",3,33,80,27 October 2014
Baby Driver," Nowhere near as good as the hype
","I was hugely excited for this, as a fan of Wright ever since Spaced. But I left feeling really underwhelmed. If you want a Kingsman style lightly amusing comedy with a good soundtrack then its great. But if you're looking for the warm, cosy, nuanced and observed humour and subtle wit of the Cornetto trilogy with a bunch of heart and charm then you might feel underwhelmed too. Whats wrong with it? (spoiler free) <ul><li>It over-relies on the central idea of music and syncing. If that had been one element on the side of a much more interesting and character driven heist film (e.g. just a gimmick of the driver), it could have worked brilliantly. But because its been SO built around that idea, you start thinking 'really, is the idea even that interesting?' The syncing becomes more distracting with its fantasy elements (e.g. Hamm shooting a gun in time to the music that Baby's listening to). Its fine for a short film or music video, but it gets stretched a little thin across a whole feature (especially when there's precious little between these moments to be interested in). </li></ul><ul><li>There are precious few actual car chases. I was expecting a climactic crazy chase on a scale with the one in Blues Brothers, something over the top and cinematic as with Hot Fuzz, but it never happens. The action shifts instead to some pedestrian action in a car park interior. The chases themselves are fairly short and really not very inventive - beside the music syncing there's just nothing interesting about them. The opening of Drive feels far more engaging and interesting in comparison. </li></ul><ul><li>The central romance falls flat. The girl just comes across as fake and irritating, with zero chemistry between them. Because of this, Baby's purpose to be with her has no credibility. </li></ul><ul><li>The other characters are all weak. I craved some of the brilliantly nuanced characters of Wrights other work, even ones that pop up for brief moments (e.g. Peggs housemate or Reese Shearsmith's character in Shaun). Spacey does a hugely watered down version of his Glengary character. Jon Bernthal's more interesting character only pops up for a brief pointless cameo to make 'retard' jokes, never to be seen again. </li></ul><ul><li>The cinematography feels dull like a TV pilot, its just not inventive in the way that it feels like it should be. Visually, its the weakest Wright film by far. </li></ul><ul><li>The plot is clichéd. For a heist film, there is nothing inventive or memorable about the writing or story whatsoever.</li></ul>The music is obviously great, and there are some nice amusing moments. But it didn't live up to the film I imagined from the hype, or Edgar's other movies, at all. I feel like people are just being suggestible to the idea of 'cool music' and marketing.",6,30,62,20 June 2017
Split," As inconsistent and uneven as the main character
","The best thing by far about Split is the performance by McAvoy. He has great fun switching personas, and the fun is infectious. Because of this, its best seen as a black comedy because you'll be smirking and giggling quite a bit at the little nuances. But without that performance, the film is pretty lame. The subplot of the girl captives trying to escape is nothing new, especially in an era of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Room, Green Room, Saw films etc. The therapy sections are extremely clichéd and dull, the old woman therapist badly underwritten. These scenes could have been so much more interesting. By the end, Shyamalan's immaturity as a filmmaker once again rears its ugly head, both trying to shoe-horn in some heavy themes (sexual abuse, self-harming) without any sensitivity or real emotional awareness, and also swerving the film firmly into absurd comic book territory. By this point its clear he didn't have a firm idea of the story he wanted to tell or why, just another gimmick that made itself up as it went, meandering all over the place. Basically, don't expect anything 'great'. Set your sights for a 2- star Netflix kinda film, then be pleasantly surprised by how fun and watchable it is (in a forgettable way).",6,13,35,18 January 2017
We're the Millers," Spoiler-free - Great Idea, Inconsistent Results
","The basic concept for this film is really strong, and could have easily been fleshed out into a knock-out comedy TV series. Like Arrested Development crossed with Breaking Bad. Because the pretend family members don't care about or really know each other, they end up treating each other horribly and looking even more like a real family than they're pretending to be. Put this situation in Mexico, throw in a drug-deal and some tense border crossing scenes, and its sit-com gold. Unfortunately the edgy, un-PC, laugh-out-loud humour quickly fades once this set-up resolves, about a third of the way in. Then it seems to ramble on forward, finding more excuses to fulfil a feature-length running time. The humour moves from modern/edgy, to 80's family/sentimental, which pulls down the overall vibes of the film. If it had spent more time in Mexico and with the drugs plot, kept the humour witty and more over-the-top, it could have been an absolute comedy classic. Its like it lost faith itself - which is a real shame, because the first third is great. I really don't think that the kind of people who enjoy the first third are going to care about the sentimental, corny character developments, and vice-versa.",5,5,9,19 August 2013
It Follows," Very Effective
","Remember that creepy old guy in the black hat from that Poltergeist sequel? Imagine those scenes but with the relentless unstoppable menace of the Terminator, played out in a strange dreamy 80s atmosphere with John Carpenter style music. That's a pretty accurate description of It Follows. Its unique enough to be interesting, and definitely scary enough to be memorable and talked about. Is it good enough to be great? I'm not so sure - I kept thinking of all the interesting avenues the story could have gone down, but it seemed reticent to really explore its own idea. Even the most obvious idea of a long, decent chase/following scene was missing. In place of more plot development, we get lots of long takes and panning shots to build the sense of menace and intrigue. Its creepy, but after a while I felt like I had adapted a little too well to the style and would have preferred more substance instead. There are to few genuinely scary moments when there could have been far, far more. I still respect the idea and the effort - and do love the movie - for me its just one of those films where I really wanted it to be great, to do justice to the strong idea.",8,50,100,17 February 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," The Main Problems With This Film (spoiler free)
","There's a chance you may like this, in which case I don't really want to taint your expectations with the things that follow. If you like whimsical fantasy and tend to like everything you watch, then don't read on. If you have some taste and a good sense of judgement, then you'll certainly be irked by the film's problems. Its tonally uneven - towards the beginning, it mixes dry office based observational humour with slapstick action scenes. It works for a while, but then changes tone completely about a third in. Now its trying to be meaningful and spirited, but it doesn't quite work. Its still too fantastical to be taken seriously. Some scenes towards the end are so long and boring, lacking any humour or emotional punches whatsoever that you'll find yourself suddenly snapping and thinking 'hey, what's going on here? What am I watching here?'The film uses fantasy daydreams as a plot device, but then after about a third of the way through, drops them completely. They're barely referred to again. Yet, the rest of the film contains elements so fantastical, whimsical and absurd that you WISH he was still daydreaming. Except he isn't. It feels really jarring, and you beg that he snaps out of a daydream so that the film isn't so ludicrous. So many things happen which are absurd. Cell phone calls whilst he's climbing up the Himalayas, having been travelling for days by this point. Flies at the drop of a hat, with just his briefcase, then has an endless supply of clothes and appropriate gear. Hasn't been or done anything interesting but is suddenly an expert skateboarder. He jumps into a helicopter being dangerously piloted by a drunkard, based on some fantasy encouragement by one of his daydreams. What kind of message is that? Live your life! Be reckless! Do dangerous things whilst drunk! Your friend drink at the bar all night? Hey, live you life, let them drive you home! His motives are never really clear. He goes to search for a lost negative from a photographer - because he wants to a) travel or b) keep his job? If a), then he could have picked plenty more goals and destinations, and the drive to start now isn't particularly strong. If b) then there are plenty of other ways to do it, and it makes no sense (he could have just said the negative was missing from the package). His personality is never really explained. He processes incredible photographs for a renowned international magazine, yet hasn't been or done anything interesting at all in his life? If his imagination was that active for his day dreams, then surely he'd have put it to better use by now? And if he has some huge fear barrier to making decisions (as shown in the opening scene) then why? Whats the emotional truth here, and how will he resolve it? Its never answered - but when he does finally go travelling, he experiences no fear at all (except for a stupid scene where he literally fights with a shark).The message of the film seems to be 'make your life more interesting, and do things, so that the opposite sex will find you more attractive'. This is a really superficial, shame based message, the complete opposite of films which imply 'be liked for who you are, not for what you do or can provide for people'. Ben Stiller plays it pretty dry and wooden, without expressing much emotion at all. I can't remember him laughing, looking sad, scared, exhilarated, nothing. Even when skateboarding down a mountain, he has the same facial expression. His lack of emotion throughout makes it hard to really engage with the character or care at all about this fantastical adventure he's supposedly going on. Sean Penn's acting is, as ever, fantastic, but feels like it really doesn't belong in this film. By the end, it feels like a massive advert for eHarmony.It also feels like a very bad imitation of the much superior film Joe Vs The Volcano.",3,70,165,17 December 2013
The Imitation Game," Great as a film, annoying as a true story
","Brilliant soundtrack, well edited, well written, well acted, and good pacing to maintain a good level of emotional engagement. Its very watchable and exciting. But there's something deeply frustrating about the decisions behind the screenplay. It clearly focuses on Turing's unfair persecution for being gay - this is the tragic element that we're left with as an audience. Which is absolutely worth a story, for sure. But if that's your angle, then why did they focus on enigma/bombe and miss out so much of his contribution to modern computing? They make out he pretty much worked alone on designing/building/running the bombe (called Christopher in the film) which is just unnecessarily false. I'm still waiting on a decent film or mini-series to portray the incredible events of what happened at Bletchley during the war: <ul><li>it was truly a collaborative effort. Gordon Welchman has just as much input as Turing on the bombe machine, which was first invented by the Poles anyhow, and built by engineers at Letchworth. There were eventually many bombe machines - not just one that Turing seemingly built with his own hands in a hangar-sized 'hut' (the huts were a lot smaller). </li></ul><ul><li>The whole design/point of the bombe was to exploit a flaw in the enigma, requiring a 'crib' - a known phrase like 'heil hitler' used in the film, which they could match up alongside the cypher to extract patterns. The film delivers this discovery as a eureka moment at the bar, well after Turing has built the bombe! Which makes no sense and is confusing to the viewer as to what the original intentions of the machine actually were. </li></ul><ul><li>The film implies there was a spy in Turing's team. Really - is this kind of cinematic device really necessary to keep audiences engaged? Was the REAL story not interesting and exciting enough?! When told properly at least. </li></ul><ul><li>There are far more angles to the story - how so many misfits/outliers were brought together to collaborate on genius ideas, with huge determination and drive. The idea that the seemingly impossible can be achieved. Its a really inspiring moment of history that should surely be pushed more in today's world. </li></ul>Its a great film ciematically, but its annoying how the personal agenda of the book's author and film's screenwriters biased the film away from truth towards one aspect of Turing's life, and in doing so failed to really do either angle as much justice as was deserved. It might have also been fitting to have shown how much sexual abuse happened at Sherborne school when/where Turing attended, which continued well through the 20th century according to well researched documentaries and reports, but I guess that's not quite as pleasing for sunday afternoon cinema audiences.",8,0,0,15 April 2018
Cold War," Its just OK. Don't fall into the trap of '4:3 ratio + BW = amazing' like the director wants you to
","Pawel Pawlikowski was so flimsy and uncertain during the making of his 'The Woman in the Fifth' (Ethan Hawke, 5.4 on IMDB) that the film ended up a huge commercial fail. It seems he's then continued his run of 85ish minute films by sticking to very simple stories told in frosty black and white and the 4:3 ratio. Why, they must be incredible arthouse films! Well, no. This is not Kieslowski or Tarkovsky. There is no greater meaning or depth to be unpicked from a frame. The more you look, the more annoyingly shallow and superficial the film feels, like its been carefully constructed to hit enough notes to look like a worthy film. You can almost feel the director thinking 'how can I shoehorn in a smoky jazz scene?' then 'how can I shoehorn in some rock'n'roll dancing?' but there's precious little relevance to such scenes. Its not a bad film. Its often nice to look at, and its fairly engaging (although it abruptly throws you out of a scene with the episodic 'jump ahead a few years' structure, when you don't feel like the scene you just saw was particularly relevant or substantial). But what's the point? Love can't be stopped? Obsession transcends time and circumstance? Please. It gets to a point where it stops being relatable and never approaches the level of emotional maturity or intelligence that it pretends. I just don't trust or think that the director really has a clue what he's doing, and is simply throwing a lot of stuff at the wall in the hope that it 'looks' like a film. But its not more than the sum of its parts - the closer you look, the emptier it becomes.",5,48,100,7 September 2018
Drag Me to Hell," Typical boring horror, shock tactics but no genuine fear
","I was greatly disappointed by this. I am a Sam Raimi fan. I got the injokes, I noticed the oldsmobile from Evil Dead, I noticed the use of the old Universal Logo.I also noticed that its just another movie to have a very, very paper thin plot as an excuse for lots of 'jump' moments which rely mostly on a sudden loud scare. There wasn't much in the way of actually caring what was going to happen.Some scenes were just ridiculously over the top. This is OK if you are wanting a silly comedy, but dragged over a feature length was pretty boring.",3,1,7,5 June 2009
Super 8," Seemingly misunderstood by many
","I'm surprised at the many negative reviews here. My only guess is that those people weren't in synch with what the film was trying to accomplish, which I think it did incredibly successfully.Its a specific genre piece almost as niched as a grindhouse film - and if you aren't in that groove, then you won't enjoy it as much as those who are. And that genre is 'Spielberg eighties'.The monster in the film is a red herring - a catalyst that drives many other stories elements forward and together.The film is really about growing up and letting go (of the past, of grief, of regret, of grudges). I noticed many subtle moments where characters are either forced to, or choose, to let go of something. The way that these moments are interwoven with the story are brilliant.If you're in synch with Spielberg style nostalgia, then there's a lot to appreciate in this film. If you're part of the soulless CGI Facebook generation, then you probably won't find it.",Null,1,2,2 August 2011
Sicario," Finally, a well made, immersive and substantial thriller
","I loved Indendies, Prisoners and Enemy so had high hopes for this - and thankfully it delivered more than expected. I've read a few user-reviews since and find that plenty of them spoil the experience of the film, so I would advise not to read too many. I've remained completely content free here in terms of story, character etc. Its best enjoyed going in blind, so you can share in the unknowingness of the central character (Emily Blunt). With Sicario, Villeneuve (with the help of excellent DP Deakins and a very talented cast) creates an entirely immersive world. This alone makes the film extremely engaging, gripping and fascinating - you feel like you're there. The soundtrack creates a feeling of horror and dread, you don't know what's going to be happen, but you don't doubt that something horrible could happen at any moment. There aren't any distracting moments or gimmicks to pull you out of the immersion - no CGI, no directorial show-off moments, no side characters saying 'that doesn't look good' etc that ruin tension in most thrillers. I realise that Villeneuve excels in this - he doesn't sell out to 'please' or amuse the audience - he understands the integrity and depth of experience that comes with telling it straight and efficiently. Sicario is a masterful and impactive film on every level. If you're cautious of going to theaters these days with all the let-downs, remakes and trashy nonsense, then Sicario won't disappoint - its a strong thriller of the highest calibre.",10,0,3,11 October 2015
The Disaster Artist," Great fun, but so much potential to have been a Kaufman-esque masterpiece
","I love The Room (despite the weird nebula of disturbance it leaves in my mind afterwards) and Greg's book The Disaster Artist (many moments of which had me burst out in laughter). Having anticipated the movie so much, I couldn't help but smile all the way through - the performances are brilliant, and the little nods and references to various aspects of the film and book are great. Tommy is as amusingly accurate as can be (its never going to be 100% successful, Tommy is completely unique). Its so much better to watch with others who are aware of The Room - you can feel the difference in reactions from people in the theater as to who 'gets it' and who doesn't. I wanted Franco to push more of the randomly odd moments of the book but I can see that its a tough balancing act in terms of portraying his character. Franco does well to instead underscore the film with this sense of inner turmoil. In less sensitive hands Wiseau could easily become a cartoon target of mockery, but Franco gently invites you to consider his humanity, dreams and insecurities. This gives the film a much stronger backbone, especially when dovetailed with his relationship to Greg. But I couldn't help but find myself in that weird, murky and unsettling place again when exposed to 'Planet Tommy'. So there's as much tension as comedy - seeing the horrible conflict of encouragement/support vs honesty, opportunities vs loyalty, altruism vs expected reciprocation, tradition vs originality, believing in yourself vs listening to criticism (or, your own perception vs everyone else's). It was a VERY ambitious and tough film to pull off considering the overall complexity, but overall they did a great job. I would have LOVED the film to have gone even more meta to see more of the actors and filming of this film, intercut. E.g. the Francos talking about their discovery of The Room, seeing more outtakes of the actors laughing their heads of when trying to recreate scenes etc. If there had been scenes of James Franco writing bits of dialogue for the film, some rehearsals etc, trying to become Tommy, it could have become an insane masterpiece (sort of like Synecdoche New York crossed with Adaptation).",8,4,11,5 December 2017
Zombieland," Vastly overrated tosh for the Facebook generation
","I really can't understand why people like this film. I enjoy zombie movies like Shaun, Dawn, and even Braindead. I love comedies like John Landis & John Hughes movies, Superbad etc.Zombieland was just another annoying, self-consciously quirky addition to the recent glut of movies that seem to be written by, produced by, and made for the washed out, tasteless and cultureless facebook crowd. People like it because they think they should.The narration and self-conscious humour was excruciatingly flat and self-conscious - at times I found myself yearning to see Fight Club again just to prove to myself that good writing does exist. The zombies were uttlerly boring, the story totally tedious (I'm not just saying that, although there were a few inspired moments the story was just completely boring and really had no point). I found the weak attempts to use the zombies as metaphors for people totally stupid as well. The final line was 'if you don't have good friends, well you might as well be a zombie'. More fitting, perhaps, would have been 'if you enjoy this movie, you might as well be a zombie'.",3,31,64,21 October 2009
American Made," Entertaining, but quickly fades
","American Made was a good watch - the story keeps a good steady momentum, the direction and editing are vibrant and dynamic. It has the vibes of something like Wolf of Wall St or a Guy Ritchie film, where despite the nature of the events you find yourself rooting for a criminal and laughing at the black comedy of how things unfold. But it stays firmly in the mode of fast-paced 'zany' without ever really digging into emotions, desperation, or any human reflection. Barry Seal as a character remains a breezy, zany blur. Its just that kind of film. I think Cruise has a lot to do with that - his vanity as an actor, having to be seen as either confused- smiley or cool-intense in any given moment limits his courage to do anything else (Born on the Fourth of July was a real anomaly for him in terms of range). Its as entertaining as any two episodes of Narcos - but without Narcos' complexity and variance. Good but not great, definitely worthy of a viewing.",6,33,40,3 December 2017
Arrival," A great movie - but not more than the sum of its parts
","As Arrival begins, you're led down that familiar path of a Villeneuve film: the dread-laden music, thoughtful cinematography, subtlety and pace imply something deeply intelligent and thoughtful is about to happen. Amy Adam's character is framed within various geometrical patterns and structures - the circular corridors of a hospital, the curved seats of a lecture hall, the square geometry of her house, a TV frame, her University building. She's surrounded by controlled patterns. This makes the arrival of the abstract orbs even more stunning, we're being asked to see something 'new' in terms of the films language. And that's essentially what Arrival hinges on - the film asks the audience to decipher its own cinematic language, whilst Louise (Adams) deciphers the aliens language. Will you have the same emotional journey that Louise does? Villeneuve clearly hopes so - but that all depends entirely on how much the film pulls you in emotionally.But its just a 'movie'. Entertainment. Beyond that, its ideas and ponderings don't have much substance - there's no real emotional insight, take-home message, honesty about the human condition or anything else to really chew on beyond a few reflective thoughts. This isn't Tarkovsky, its not even classic sci-fi. Its more like an extended Twilight Zone or Black Mirror episode. I think the thing that makes it seem more intelligent/emotional than it actually is, is the clever use of flashbacks. Whenever I see this in a film (notably Nolan's Insomnia, Batman Begins, Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, who I feel Villeneuve has been influenced by) it has a powerful effect - juxtaposing some current situation with some whimsical emotional moment. But the emotions here feel forced - we're not dealing with the nuance of human nature, its that broad-strokes Hollywood kind of 'emotional' that feels more like a cute idea that anything real. It just doesn't really add up to anything more than the sum of its (admittedly very good) parts. My challenge to any of its fans is this - what is the film really about? Any great film should have a few interesting answers to that question. With Arrival, I'm struggling to find an honest answer that does justice to the quality of the production.",5,3,12,1 November 2016
Mother!," Brilliant and interesting - depending on your open mindedness
","I've seen a lot of criticism of this film - mostly from people who seem to take the goings-on literally, as if its a standard home-invasion thriller that goes 'incomprehensibly artsy'. Its clearly an impressionist piece that certainly makes a very strong impression - and among all the other bland and horrifically boring films out there, its beyond me that anyone could bash Aronofsky for going against the grain. The script is subtle and effective. If you have any leanings towards feminism and concepts of gaslighting, male dominance, gender inequalities in relationships, then you'll squirm with how effectively the layers start to build. There is no let-up - it builds, and builds, and builds, until it pushes you completely off the edge. It ties it all to themes of circular causality, how primal instinct struggles to ever find its place. I got so caught up in the central characters frustrations that towards the end, there were moments that had me in tears, where I actually wanted to sob. I can't say it was a pleasant experience, but I applaud Aronofsky for doing something different. If I have one criticism, is that Aronofsky's approach is very masculine, in terms of how visceral and extreme he takes it. I'd loved to have seen the same ideas explored by a female writer/director. My fear is that some of the points and ideas raised about male dominance will be buried and distracted away from by the more extreme moments and eventual climax.Overall though, a great film, with excellent production design, camerawork and sound design.",9,4,11,15 February 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Wow. Studio shills abound - this movie is terrible
","More and more, big budget films that happen to be rubbish suddenly have one-review users writing glowing 10-star reviews. Some of the quotes in the 10-star reviews for John Wick are absolutely laughable. 'Best action film of the decade, superior to the original in every way'. NO WAY. It a terrible film. The action scenes are well choreographed, but highly repetitive, monotonous and unengaging. Not a single head shot compares to the impact of ones in The Town or The Departed for example. Its like watching a kid play a video game. The bits between are flat, hypnotically boring, and border on the absolute stupid in places. Its often like watching a weird dream, like The Neon Demon if written by morons. The first had heart and soul, and was likable and engaging for that reason. The sequel doesn't. Its hard to appreciate even in a mindless late-night who-cares kind of way, because its that unengaging. The cinematography was nice in places, and I enjoyed the soundtrack. But shame on the marketing team for employing fake reviews, a really sad strategy.",2,88,177,1 March 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," A tip for watching the film, to prevent disappointment.
","Firstly - this was one film I was really looking forward to having been hyped up on the Harry Knowles site. It tried to be Sam Raimi, it tried to be Hostel, but it failed on all counts because it couldn't settle on any particular tone. At the beginning, a juxtaposition between a corporate office environment and a retro horror film vibe with the cabin feels a bit like the seventies movie WestWorld. But whilst WestWorld took itself seriously and had an eerie, gritty vibe (thanks to Michael Crichton), Cabin in the Woods tries too eagerly to please with lame humour, whilst still trying to take itself seriously. This is where it tries to emulate Sam Raimi, and fails miserably, because its neither funny nor scary. The Cabin segments evolve from goofy/silly into (trying to be) scary. The corporate segments evolve from serious, into goofy and silly. Because of this, you have no idea what to think or feel whilst watching these tones shift. It just feels messy, there is no solid frame of reference. I appreciate this may have been on purpose, to keep the audience on its toes, but it doesn't work at all. You end up just not caring about either segment, because you don't know what to trust. You're just waiting for the 'big reveal'. The reason for the juxtaposition for these two opposite environments gives the film its intrigue, you spend all your time trying to figure out the motive. I kept waiting for another meta-level of irony and satire to emerge. Perhaps the control room is funded by Hollywood, and this is how all the lame horror movies really get made? No such luck. One tip for watching the film - keep yourself firmly in a Sam Raimi frame of mind, a la 'Drag Me To Hell' so you know not to get too 'off track' with your predictions. The film descends into complete silliness by the end, and if you were falsely lulled into a 'Hostel' or 'WestWorld' vibe then you'll be sorely disappointed. Another thing worth mentioning - the score of this film was by David Julyan, who scored The Descent and Eden Lake. All three movies capture similar vibes with the very similar scores by Julyan (and wide angle shots of cars driving into woods). His score here was far too similar to those films - but what a difficult film to score, having to jump from eerie to silly/goofy at the drop of a hat. Julyan was definitely a wrong choice.",3,39,88,27 March 2012
Valkyrie," Refreshing, exciting, old fashioned caper movie
","If you're tired of Hollywood explosions, self conscious dialogue, weak attempts to please all audiences etc then you'll find Valkyrie a breath of fresh air. Its a relief to know that people like Bryan Singer are in the system, still daring (and having the power) to make great films in the tradition of those before.Valkyrie was immediately interesting and watchable due to its tight plotting, efficient script, and restraint. Its one of those films that you can actually enjoy whilst watching it, which I find rare these days. It doesn't rely on a big gimmick, climax or 'twist' to reward the viewer, it does it throughout with excellent performances and suspense.",9,2,5,9 March 2009
Alien: Covenant," In some ways its excellent, but as an Alien film its infuriating
","In the first 20 minutes I was so happy with Covenant. It felt sharp, atmospheric, there are interesting character situations, emotive moments and infinitely better writing than we had in Prometheus. As it progresses, this feeling continues - thankfully, a solid sci-fi film that got it right. Then Ridley starts to indulge in his convoluted ideas about creation and destruction. Its like switching from 1977 George Lucas to 1999 Lucas. You can almost hear Ridley at a writing meeting saying 'this'll be cool, and this, and this, and then this' and the writer saying 'uh, is this for the same film or later in the series?' 'Yeah just cram it all in, make it happen'. You end up with three different films - a first act like a modern Alien which I loved, a middle act of Prometheus style philosophizing that feels like more Westworld, then a last act of two shoe-horned in action scenes homaging Aliens and Alien 3 respectively. Except there is no satisfaction at all, because the aliens are rushed, a bit silly, often awkwardly CGI looking, and not even convincing as threats because we don't care about any of it. By the end I just have no idea what to think. I just think it would have worked much better if the ideas were done justice in their own film, rather than ham-fistedly trying to ram them into an Alien film to try and please fans and make box-office.",7,233,375,12 May 2017
