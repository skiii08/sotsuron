Sucker Punch," Unusual film: Love it or hate it, but must watch it.
","This film has very good points: the music, the stenography, the multiple realities approach, Scott glen and Jena Malone. It has very bad points, too, like the main character, Emily browning, anything but an action films actress, who performs horrible in combat choreography. Combat scenes have plenty of special effects, but awful choreography. Do not expect something like Milla Jovovich combat performance. The plot is much more complex than you could expect at first, so if you are looking for some empty, girls with guns, combat movie you will be very disappointed (for instance, if you go to watch the movie because of you like the movie promos and posters). I think the best of this movie is the mix of reality with bizarre action scenes, pretty photography, very adequate music, and some touches of pulp fiction, kill bill and other Tarantino productions. Should you go to watch this movie? I think the answer is YES. Even if you do not like it as a hole you will enjoy, as I have said, good music, nice photography and an unusual production.",6,0,3,30 August 2014
The Purge," Between awful and horrible
","What can I say? Stupid characters, lots and lots of plot holes, predictable ending. Interesting initial idea (one night, every year, murder is legal) but stupid justification (so, if you allow them to kill one night, every psychopath, every passion crime, every murder motivated by money...just will not happen the other 364 nights....yeah, it is clear that the director and the writers knows a lot about human psychology). And, hey, we the rich ones, instead of leaving the country for vacations that day, we buy absurdly expensive and in fact completely ineffective security systems. In addition, we do not think about hire some mercenaries to protect our residential area, no, it is much better to give a gun to our absolutely idiot ten year old son. Do not lose your time with this piece of crap.",2,1,1,29 August 2014
