Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie is Bantha Fodder
","The Phantom Menace insulted my intelligence every step of the way. As a Star Wars purist I was thoroughly disappointed. There are foundational problems with the directing and screenwriting. Lucas does not develop the characters, and the plot is paper thin. I also felt that he poorly used some of the effects he had available. My friends and I went to a diner after watching it and dissected every detail, and we for the most part trashed this hyped-up menace to the screen.The movie does has its strengths: the cutting edge special effects, Liam Neeson in the only respectable performance and the simple fact that it is a Star Wars movie. Unfortunately, these strengths are limited.That Jar-Jar character has got to go - more annoying than anything I have ever seen. The insertion of his comic relief while the good guys are in the throws of battle is ridiculous.One of the most upsetting aspects of this movie is Yoda. I guess they designed a new puppet, or did something drastic to the old one, because he looks terrible. He looks like a puppet, and not like the charming shaman we see in Empire and Jedi.",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
