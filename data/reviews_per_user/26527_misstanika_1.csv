It," Worse movie created
",Growing up watching horror movies I'm so disappointed in this movie. Let me start out by saying sure a part 2 will be made due to the ending of this movie.Next let me say the voice of Penny Wise WTH? That clown isn't scary. This movie was more funny if anything. To this day the original 'IT' movie scares me and I'm 35 yrs old. I wish these directors and producers would stop remaking classic movies it just doesn't workout especially the horror movies. One can not and I mean can not remake a Stephen King origianl stop it already. The remake of Nightmare on Elm street another example of a bad idea. Freddy was my height and I'm 4'7 dammit. He wasn't scary. Leave these movies alone please stop wasting money get creative and do something different.,1,2,7,18 February 2018
