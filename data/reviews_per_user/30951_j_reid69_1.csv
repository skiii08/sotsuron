United 93," No sensationalizing, succinct and to the point
","I am loathe to say I enjoyed this film as I do not think it is a film to be enjoyed, but it was well done, succinct, to the point, and did not milk the audience for tears. Many of the characters were played by themselves, i.e. ATC and military personnel. I do not feel it is too soon for this film to be released, and I do feel that America has already slid back into a place of comfort and semi-apathy. I think the film is an excellent reminder of necessary vigilance on our part. It did not leave me with a negative feeling towards Muslim people. I was slightly amused that the European gentlemen on the flight was portrayed as wanting only to try and negotiate with the terrorists. But, mostly I was left with a sense of pride for being an American, a sadness at the senseless loss of lives, and wondering what it would have been like if the passengers would have succeeded. I hurried to see this film this weekend as proceeds will be donated towards the memorial for Flight 93 for sales only collected this weekend. (4/28/2006)",9,6,13,28 April 2006
