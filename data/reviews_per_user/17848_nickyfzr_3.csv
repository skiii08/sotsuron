Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good but not great
","While I enjoyed this movie, it didn't really impress me. I liked the first three better. They seemed more real and gritty where The Phantom Menace looked to sterile. I know this is gonna p**s off a lot of Star Wars freaks but I think The Matrix was a much better movie.",Null,0,1,3 March 2000
Pulp Fiction," Refreshingly different
","This movie was a blast. Enjoyable from beginning to end. The characters were original and funny, even when they were being their most violent. Most people I know liked this movie but I guess you can't please all the people all the time. Screw em. Check out Jackie Brown.",Null,0,0,3 March 2000
The Matrix," Great Movie
","This movie blew me away the first time I saw it. It then went on to blow me away every time I saw it there after.Just when you think you found something wrong, it makes sense. The only thing wrong I found was in the scene when Neo gets the phone  from the Fed-Ex guy, you can see somebodies hand in back of him in the scene. I truly think this is the greatest movie ever made. Any one who says this movie is not good,not written well, or has bad acting in its is either jealous or couldn't follow the storyline and it fustrated them. Can't wait for the next two parts. I would love to see the movie go back in time to when they pulled trinity out of the matrix. It would be cool to see her hacker years.Larry and Andy are it.",10,0,0,26 February 2000
