The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The best of the series
","I'm a twilight fan. No apologies. I've read the books, seen all the movies and discussed them many times. Breaking Dawn gave me exactly what I wanted. Which was the romance, the funny moments, the wedding, Isle Esme, the honeymoon, the pregnancy, the birth and the transformation. It toned down what I didn't want, namely the laughable wolf-pack and way too much Jacob's pov. It's all win for me. The one thing the other movies consistently lacked were the small scenes, the little interactions that made me fall in love with the books. They just hit the highlights and kept going. Here, it's slowed down and you're able to enjoy the most faithful to the book movie yet.I loved that we really got to feel Bella's nervous trepidation walking down the aisle..until she saw Edward that is. Her and Edward's first time was so beautiful and the music was just perfect. The end with the birth, while not as bloody and graphic as the book was still horrifying and when Bella was transformed it left me wanting the next movie, NOW.People argue constantly about bad role models, and being slow paced or it has too much of this person or that, the acting sucks yada yada. Whatever. I think it's simple. At its core it's a tale of one imperfect woman's journey and her handsome vamp boyfriend who will love her till the day he dies. I also think the actors all nailed it. Yes, including Taylor. If you love the books and Bella and Edward's love story, then this movie is for you.",10,4,14,22 November 2011
