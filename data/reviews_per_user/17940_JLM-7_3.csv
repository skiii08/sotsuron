The Blair Witch Project," Serious Mind Screw
","The Blair Witch Project scared me as only one movie before, that being The Exorcist. TBWP is not a gruesome, horrid, gore-fest as there is maybe one scene is featuring blood. All the terrors and monsters in TBWP are those that lie within ones own mind. As Heather, Mike and Josh become more and more desperately lost in the Maryland woods, you begin to feel them closing in around the heroes and yourself. The film is so immersive that you too feel like a part of the film crew that has become lost. You feel anger towards Josh, worried about Mike, and sorry for Heather. When you hear Heather's final confession, it's as though one of your own children or friends are saying goodbye from beyond the grave. The scariest thing is that these three actors never had a script, just a vague outline of the film and the producers following them and tormenting them throughout the process of filming. That means that all reactions onscreen are real and not portrayals. TBWP is not a horror film, but a serious mind screw as it dives not only into the what is out there formula horror but, the what the hell is going on in your mind formula of psychological thrillers.",Null,0,1,20 October 1999
Unbreakable," Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson prove what a great team they make and M.Night Shymalan redeems himself
","I went into this movie being VERY VERY skeptical, because I was one of the few who HATED The Sixth Sense. I thought that movie was boring, predictable and just plain badly executed. While the actors did give great performances, the movie, I felt, didn't handle it's subject matter properly, and was paced too slowly. It gave me a poor outlook on any other of Shymalan's films.With Unbreakable, Shymalan managed to erase that stigma, and prove that he can make a wonderful and compelling film. The handling of the subject matter in this film is just undeniably superb. There are no loose ends left lying around like Sixth Sense. This is the story of a normal guy who struggles to believe that he's a little more extraordinary then the rest of us. Halfway through the Sixth Sense, I'd figured the ending out and was ready to shut it off, with this movie, while I did figure the ending out fairly early, I still couldn't take my eyes from the screen, wanting to see EXACTLY WHY the characters did what they felt compelled to do. The film begins at a qick pace and just picks up speed along the way culminating in a wonderful and exciting (if not slightly predictable)climax. Add to this the fact that Bruce Willis once again proves how underrated he is as a great and versatile actor. Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, simply amazing. The two who first teamed together on Die Hard With A Vengeance, proved that they did indeed make that film watchable time after time. Even if you're not a fan of this movie, watch it just once more to see how well these two play off of each other. This film is a true masterpiece and is in my mind a modern classic, far superior to Sixth Sense in every way, and a much more emotionally powerful film as well. The struggles with in David Dunn himself and within his family are just amazingly intense, yet reassuring scenes. I can say proudly for the first time now that M. Night Shymalan has the potential to be one of the greatest storytellers of our time. I thank him for such a great and memorable story.",10,0,0,27 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," The Best Action Movie in a long long time
",Words can't describe how great this movie is. It's got a brain with it unlike most action flicks out there. The plot is good and a superbly paced. This is the first movie John Woo's ever made that I've liked. The action doesn't get in the way of the plot and helps move it along. And it's great to see Cruise back in familiar territory. After so long away from the genre he proves he can still kick ass with the best of them. As a huge fan of the original M:I movie I was kinda' disappointed when I found ot that Woo would be directing but I'm glad to say that he put story first and great action scenes that are breathtaking are still preserved. This movie in every way surpasses the original. GO SEE IT NOW!!!!,Null,0,0,24 May 2000
