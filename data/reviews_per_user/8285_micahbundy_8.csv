Blade Runner 2049," Rare Breed of Film
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and is directed by Denis Villeneuve. This film exists within the Blade Runner franchise and takes place thirty years after the events of the original. This film follows a young blade runner named K (Ryan Gosling) who finds an important secret and tracks Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford) to find the meaning of it.This is truly a beautiful film. It's one of the few films I have seen when you can feel the love that the director put into it. You can tell that Villeneuve spent many late nights perfecting every detail of this film. He surrounded himself with some of the best in production design, screenplay, and music. You can see the love that Villeneuve not only has for the franchise, but for film in general. That's why this film was running on all cylinders.This film took every great aspect of the original and improved on them, while taking the things that didn't work and fixing those as well. The film has mind-blowing concepts and themes and even manages to put a fresh new spin on the ones that were borrowed from the original. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch bring a riveting soundtrack that even rivals Vangelis' brilliant soundtrack from the original. The soundtrack is complimented by some of the best cinematography ever seen on film. Roger Deakins gives us a film that is a feast for the eyes during every second of a film that is almost three hours long.The film fixes the originals biggest issue that is the characters. While the characters in the original felt like they lacked depth and were poorly written, the characters in this film were well acted and had great arcs.The film lacks any emotional drawl to the characters, but this is okay because the characters have their own emotional value and clear motivations. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford's characters are prime examples of this. As the film progresses K struggles with his humanity and you really feel for Ryan Goslings' character, due to his great performance. Harrison Ford gives one of his greatest performances in his career. While Deckard was dull in the original, he gives an emotional performance, where he is traumatized by the events in his life over the past thirty years. The film has few action sequences, but when it does they feel crisp and creative. They are made intense by the soundtrack and are stunning due to Deakins' beautiful scenery. These sequence were truly a group effort and that's why they felt perfect.There will be people who will find this film boring, but for me it's the opposite. With all the excellent aspects of this film that I mentioned before and the immaculate detail that director Denis Villeneuve put into this film, it makes for not only the best film of 2017, but one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Denis Villeneuve created an immersive experience that reminded me why I love movies and that's why Blade Runner 2049 is an easy: 10/10",10,2,9,3 February 2018
Memento," Masterpiece in Reverse
","Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce), who is trying to track down the man that murdered and raped his wife. However, he struggles with this due to his reoccurring short-term memory loss. He copes with this by writing everything that he deems important, on photos and on his body. He does this in an effort to find out who killed his wife. The best aspect of the film is how you are thrown into Leonard's shoes, while part of this is due to Guy Pearce's great performance, this is mostly due to director Christoper Nolan's brilliance in writing and directing. He does this by using repetition and telling the story in reverse. This film uses repetition very effectively. Leonard constantly suffers from his short-term memory and has to remind himself of what his life looks like after the event that causes his short-term memory loss. He does this by checking his pictures and his writing to see what he drives, where he lives, what clues he has, and which people are a part of his life, as well as how he feels about these people. Like I said, the film does this a lot, putting emphasis on his condition. This, as well as Pearce's performance, makes the condition extremely believable. The film is brilliantly told in reverse. As the film progresses backwards, not only is more revealed about Leonard's character, but just as much is revealed about the characters around him. What kind of a person they are, what their motivations are, and why they're involved in the life of someone like Leonard. It feels like peeling an onion, each time the film works its way backwards, we get another layer of these characters around him. This is done well throughout the course of this film and makes their motivations and their role in Leonard's life clear by the end of the film. As these characters around him develop, a question is posed. Who killed Leonard's wife? During the beginning of the film, there is a prime suspect with an overwhelming amount of evidence for this question. But as the film goes on, this becomes unclear and more characters are thrown into the mix. As the characters develop they also become part of the list of suspects. This creates a feeling of uncertainty throughout the course of the film, which makes the film addictive and fun to figure out.Another great aspect of this film is how it creates a question during the film and quickly answer itself as the film works its way backwards. This helps you put the clues together and gets you that much closer to solving the murder. The film does this a lot and the sequences are short and choppy. Although, halfway through the film there is a particular sequence that drags on and I ended up forgetting what question I was trying to answer in the first place. Fortunately, the film picks back up after this. Overall, Memento is an excellent film. It's brilliantly written and directed. Nolan does a great job of putting you in Leonard's shoes, which makes the film addictive. Guy Pearce gives a great performance, that is complimented by the supporting actors who are well written and have great character development. This film is one of a kind and makes for an easy: 10/10",10,1,2,12 February 2018
Baby Driver," The Most Unique Film of 2017
","2018 Iowa All-State Individual Competition Nominated Review: Baby Driver is written and directed by Edgar Wright. The film follows a young getaway driver named Baby. He is sucked into a life of crime by a mob boss, who is played by Kevin Spacey. Spacey's character uses different crews for each heist, but he always uses Baby as his driver, because Baby, played by Ansel Elgort, is the best getaway driver there is, and the film establishes this in the very first scene. Baby meets a waitress played by Lily James and romance comes into play. They both want to get away from their day to day lives and just drive, but Baby is trapped in this life of crime and can't seem to get out. However, this is where the film takes off. At its core, this movie is about style, action sequences, characters, and story. In the film, Baby gets into a car accident as a kid, this causes him to have Tinnitus in his ears. Tinnitus is the constant ringing and buzzing in the ears. However, he does drown this out by plugging the headphones in and listening to music all of the time. The music he listens to is actually found in the form of a thirty-five song soundtrack. Director Edgar Wright takes this soundtrack and lets each song dictate an individual scene. He does this by matching each sound effect and action in the film to each beat of the song. Wright does this extremely well and the music puts the viewer in Baby's position, causing the viewer to understand his character better and connect with him on a deeper level. Baby Driver is all about its getaway sequences and these are simply some of the best getaway sequences ever done. Wright uses little CGI, but when he does it's never obvious due to how practical the sequences are.These sequences are fluent and feel real. This is due to Weight using the actual actors when filming, as well as shooting on the Atlanta freeway. All of this makes for some of the most high octane driving sequences ever seen on film. What makes the characters great in this film is the chemistry between them. Lily James´s character and Ansel Elgort's character have excellent chemistry, making for a very believable romance throughout the course of the film. This is a reflective image of an actual married couple in the film. The married couple, played by Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez is a picture of what Baby and his girlfriend could´ve been. Kevin Spacey plays a very commanding figure and the respect that each crew has for him is very clear during the film. Another great aspect is the anti-chemistry between each crew. It is very obvious that each of the characters within the crew is driven by their own individual goals, leading to lots of arguments and bad blood between the crews. Jamie Foxx´s character is a prime example of this, as he is always causing mischief within the crews. 
 The story of Baby Driver never takes itself too seriously. Wright does a great job of taking a certain event in the film and throwing it in the opposite direction of where the viewer might think the film is going. This is demonstrated when Baby and his girlfriend receive help from an unlikely character. The film does this a lot, keeping the viewer invested and constantly on the edge of their seat. Wright also manages to brilliantly tell the story through driving sequences with little to no dialogue. He does this by utilizing their actions, facial expressions, and the soundtrack itself. This is a nice touch from Wright and one that most modern filmmakers simply don't possess. The movie is engaging enough that the viewer will care about the characters, but at the same time, it is light-hearted enough, making for easy viewing and an enjoyable film. This film does have negatives, but they are mostly nitpick and minor takeaways. While the chemistry between Ansel Elgort and Lily James is great and they have a believable romance, their romance feels shoved aside for the sake of the plot. This film would have benefited from a longer running time to expand upon their relationship. There were minor things that stood out early on in the film, but as the film progressed they were explained and ended up canceling themselves out. For instance, during the first scene, Baby drives a red Subaru for a heist in broad daylight, which doesn't seem logical, but this is remedied when Baby puts himself between two other red cars and loses the police when he switches his position, while under a bridge. The film keeps the viewer invested because of how it is not as predictable as one might think. The film has high octane action sequences that feel real and intense. The film is stylish when the soundtrack comes on and the acting in this film is excellent.The chemistry between the characters is great. This great chemistry is on display from the main and supporting characters alike. The film has very few negatives and they're all minor things and some even tend to cancel themselves out as the film progresses. Overall, Baby Driver is an amazing and unique film that feels refreshing amongst a generation of reboots and sequels. Because of this, the film requires multiple viewings and that is why I gave it a: 9.2/10.",9,1,3,27 March 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A Marvel Film That Is Perfectly Balanced As It Should be
","Avengers: Infinity War is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. The film follows Thanos on his quest for all six of the infinity stones in efforts to wipe out half of the universe. As he tries to complete his quest, the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy band together to stop him from completing this quest. Like most films do, Avengers: Infinity War establishes what kind of film it will be right in the first scene. The film establishes the emotion, action, humor, and the intense villain. As the film progresses none of this ever lets up and we get the most exhilarating Marvel experience to date. The Russo brothers orchestrate this film masterfully. They were able to juggle all the characters in one film, in ways that are certainly welcomed and unexpected. They did this by taking certain heroes and grouping them off with other heroes as they try to achieve different goals throughout the course of the film. While the Russo brothers manage to juggle all these characters, they also manage to bring out the best aspects of these heroes and their previous films. This strikes a perfect balance in the film of emotional, humorous, and action-packed moments. As the film shifts focus to each group of heroes, these moments compliment each other, making for the smoothest pacing we have seen in a Marvel film. This is due to the Russo brothers bringing along other directors from previous MCU films to executively produce the film. However, the perfect balance does not stop at the heroes, as we get a great story for Thanos as well. Not only is Thanos the most intense MCU villain, but he is the best MCU villain to date. Josh Brolin gives an excellent performance that establishes his character as an intimidating one, where the stakes feel like they are actually against our favorite heroes. Brolin's character is also the best-written villain in the MCU. As our favorite heroes try to achieve their goals, Thanos sets out and tries to achieve his own. Thanos gets the most screen time out of any villain in the MCU and his story give us insight and depth into his character. Thanos isn't trying to destroy half of humanity for the sake of destroying half of humanity. His well-written character arc shows us that he has emotion and a reason for his madness. This is the first MCU film where the story feels like it is equally told through the lens of the heroes and the villain, making for the greatest Marvel villain to date. I can't say much without spoiling the film, but the Russo brothers manage to find a perfect balance in all of our favorite heroes while giving us the best Marvel villain to date. This makes the culmination of ten years in the MCU feel well worth the wait. This is not only the best Marvel experience I have had but one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had. Don't miss what could certainly be the film event of the summer and possibly the year. My score: 9.75/10",9,0,0,28 April 2018
Psycho," PSYCHOlogical terror at its best!
","Psycho is a slasher/thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This film follows a young Phoenix secretary named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). She embezzled forty thousand dollars from her employer so she can get away with her secret lover. During this, she tries to avoid a police officer that is suspicious of her by taking back roads and stops at the Bates Motel. She meets the owner of the motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, he seems like a polite man, but as the film moves on she becomes unsure of him and his intentions. My nitpick with this film comes from the beginning of this film. In the beginning of this film, Alfred Hitchcock does a great job of establishing the character, as he always does. The beginning of this film uses the setting, her job, the things around her, and all the smallest details of her character to do so. This makes her stealing the forty thousand dollars feel like a very believable move for the character. Hitchcock continues to do this and it pays off as the character sees great development throughout the first half of the film. Although, as this happens, this film is simply without an identity and even when Norman Bates arrives on the scene, you can't help but wonder what kind of film your watching.This is quickly shoved aside when you learn what kind of character Norman Bates is and what his intentions are. From here on the film feels perfect. Bernard Herrmann gives a chilling score that becomes even more effective in the second half of the film when it compliments intense murder scenes and Anthony Perkins terrifying performance. Anthony Perkins simply gives one of the best performances ever. He gives a truly disturbing one that still keeps the viewer wanting more. Anthony Perkins takes over this film by himself.The second half of this film moves smoothly and is very unpredictable. This film boasts great character development, an unexpected and fulfilling plot, and one of the greatest performances ever seen on film. This film has one or two negatives that are only nitpicking and doesn't take away from the film. For me, this is a near perfect film, but this is mostly due to Anthony Perkins performance. My score: 9.5/10",9,0,0,23 January 2018
Jaws," A true classic
","Jaws is a classic in the thriller genre that is directed by Steven Spielberg and it is the film adaptation of Peter Benchley's story. This film follows a sheriff dealing with shark attacks in a tourist town as he struggles with a mayor who won't shut the beach down. During this he receives help from two unlikely allies that help him go after the shark.This is a simple plot and while it isn't the greatest nor the most intriguing, it's made up for by heart-pounding moments here and there, made all the more suspenseful by John William's haunting soundtrack. These suspenseful moments serve as a way to build up the mystery of the terrible shark, making for an even greater reveal when the viewer finally sees the shark at the end of the film.Besides the technical aspect of this film, this film is also ahead of its time because of its moments of suspense and pure terror that were unlike any before its time. Not only is it ahead of its time, but the moments of suspense and terror makes it a film that holds up well today. The casting in this film was well done, especially in the three main characters ( Martin Brody, Matt Hopper, and Quint). Each of these main characters give great performances that make for some excellent character development. While this film is mostly classified as a horror movie, it has a great balance of suspenseful moments, light-hearted humor, and even some unexpected monologues. This film has great pacing that builds up for a fantastic final act and has very few negatives that aren't usually noticeable upon the first viewing. All of this makes for an easy 9.5/10.",9,1,2,14 January 2018
Black Panther," A Marvel Experience Like No Other
","Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Ryan Coogler. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), shortly after the events of Civil War. He takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced city that is hidden in Africa. He quickly faces challenges though, as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), comes for the throne.The best aspect of the film is Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler creates an authentic setting that is full of vibrant colors, beautiful scenery, fascinating culture, and advancements in technology. There are some beautiful shots in the film that are complimented by the excellent color choice. The culture is truly fascinating from its great costumes to its interesting traditions. There is also a nice contrast within the culture, of old and new. While Wakanda is constantly innovating, it stays grounded in it's old and unique traditions. Wakanda's advancements in technology are fun to watch, whether it's in action sequences or the daily lifestyles of a Wakandan. This is world-building at its finest. Coogler gives us an authentic world that feels lived in, compared to other settings in the MCU like Asgard from the Thor franchise.The action sequences can be best described as fluent. These sequences are fast-paced and well choreographed. The Wakandan technology makes these sequences exciting. These are simply some of the most entertaining sequences ever seen in the MCU.Chadwick Boseman gives you that slick and intelligent character that is expanded upon in the film.The chemistry is great, especially in the four main protagonists. T'Challa and each member of his crew have believable relationships and each character serve their own purpose within his crew. Letitia Wright's Shuri and T'Challa have a dynamic relationship, where they actually feel like siblings. She also accounts for most of the comic relief in the film. Danai Gurira's Okoye is an all business character that is loyal to her king. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia. While she is mostly there as T'Challa's love interest, she has her own set of goals that adds another layer to her character, as well as T'Challas.The character that really steals the show is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. His character has powerful and clear motivations, that some might even find relatable. This makes his character conflicting for the viewer as they choose between him and T'Challa. While most villains in the MCU suffer from being poorly written, Killmonger has some great scenes that build up his character and give his character a legitimate purpose that most MCU villains lack. Killmonger even causes T'Challa to question himself, which is the mark of a great villain. Yet he still felt like he didn't get enough screen time and some of the scenes in this film could have easily been replaced with scenes that give more insight into his character.The film had few negatives, but they're worth talking about. This film lacks emotional moments. Without the emotional moments, this film lends itself as a very predictable one. The film does have social commentary and some political agendas. The political agendas take the form of two lines though. The lines still feel like they were throw in there and just felt unnecessary in a Marvel film.Overall, Black Panther is unlike any Marvel experience I have ever had. This film definitely feels like a Marvel film, but it separates itself from its predecessors. Coogler creates an authentic setting that has a lot going for it. The film boasts great effects, action sequences, and cinematography. The film has excellent main and supporting characters. Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date but still didn't get enough screen time. The film is predictable and has some unnecessary political agendas. Like I said, Black Panther is a unique experience. One that certainly should be experienced in the theaters. My score: 8.0/10",8,9,35,17 February 2018
Blade Runner," Could of been more.... but still good
","Blade Runner is directed by Ridley Scott. No doubt, Scott is a visionary director. That is certainly on display in this film. Scott builds a world that is stunning and immersive. The film boasts great effects and is truly a visual masterpiece that is complimented by Vangelis' excellent soundtrack.This film is ambitious and certainly is ahead of its time. While the film has ambitions, some of the scenes fall flat due to inconsistent acting and undeveloped concepts. Some of the acting is great in this film. Harrison Ford as Deckard and Rutger Hauer as Roy give great performances. While both of these actors give us these great performances, it's the actors that play the Replicants who make good scenes feel dry and certainly don't do Ford and Hauer's characters justice. While there are heart-pumping moments in this movie, some of the scenes are just flat-out boring and feel like they're missing something that would make for an intriguing scene. Despite the negatives, the plot advances smoothly and makes for a memorable story. This movie is definitely a classic though, but because of the visuals and effects, rather than the content of the film. I like this film, I don't love it and that's why my overall score is: 7.8/10",7,1,2,23 December 2017
