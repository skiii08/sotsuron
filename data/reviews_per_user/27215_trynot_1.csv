Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As a Star Wars fan, I was not disappointed!
","This movie exceeded my expectations, which were very high! I can not say this is my favorite of the Star Wars movies, but of all movies this is one of my top ten. The computer effects were incredible and highly believable. EVERYTHING LOOKED REAL! I was taken away to a far away galaxy and intrigued by the politics and life styles of the various alien races. The fact that so many very different races coexisted at all is too incredible to hope for. As for the choice of actors, I was quite pleased! The young Obi-Wan even sounded like the man he will become (Alec Guinness). Liam Neesom as Qui-Gon Jinn was my favorite! He is always my favorite! I absolutely love him. The queen was sophisticated and yet real - you could believe she was actually 14 years old at times. I thought the young actor who portrayed Anakin Skywalker did a marvelous job. Obviously there are some negatives to this movie. I just don't care to discuss them. May the Force be with you - go see this movie - oh yes, I liked the Jar Jar character too, and so did my four year old daughter!",10,6,8,28 May 1999
