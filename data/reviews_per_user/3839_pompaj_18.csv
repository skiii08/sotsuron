Raiders of the Lost Ark," fun movie
","I'm sure nobody needs me to tell them why this movie is so good. That's because Jones has become a classic superhero. He's a guy who defies death constantly and surrounds himself with crazy people, many of them villains. He's basically James Bond, only as an archaeologist. He goes after treasures and so his adventures take him all around the world. This movie in particular is good because it has a cool plot that really moves. The opening classic sequence is amazing, but it doesn't stop there. Four fifths of this movie are really great. Then there's a stupid, fake looking, climactic scene, but so what. You subtract that and you have a perfect movie and nobody's perfect right? So it makes one mistake. That's a lot less than most movies. It's still terrific.",Null,0,0,13 March 2001
Minority Report," good, but not as original as it looks
","This was a good movie loaded with ideas and it's a shame that they weren't all original. So much of this was creative, that it really bugged me when the writing spoiled it by ripping off LA Confidential with a surprise death scene, and also the fugitive, and even snake eyes, (that overhead shot was a DePalma move, even if nobody saw it). Despite these cheap attempts to hide the lack of originality, there is still a ton going for this movie. The PreCrime system is really clever. The plot and what one has to do in this situation, considering the workings of precrime, is also extremely smart. And the atmosphere and bleached look of the film is out of this world. This is the best Spielberg movie I've seen in a while. AI was stupid (when it wasn't Kubrick behind the scene), and Catch Me If You Can was corny as hell. Here, with Minority Report, Spielberg almost hits a home run. I could have got past the DePalma move, but they shouldnt have touched LA Confidential. Oh, well. It's still a good, cool film, even if it didnt do it all on its own.",Null,0,0,8 February 2003
Training Day," Intense as it can get
","This was a real good movie because it was gripping and hardcore and totally rocked out with intensity. The first half wasnt slow, it just wasnt half as fast as the movie became. The plot is pretty cool and the action is real nice. There's adrenaline pumping through this one like nothing we've seen in a long while. I'm not the biggest ethan hawke fan, but he really is perfect for this role. And Washington, that man is amazing in this one. It's a good, well written character and he completely embodies it and makes it feel completely real. This movie is the best thing I've seen in a long time.",Null,1,11,5 November 2001
Dead Poets Society," A terrific film
",There's so much good about this movie. The first time I saw it I watched it solely for plot and I loved it. Now I've seen it again and watched Peter Weir's filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he's serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way.,Null,95,121,17 July 2000
Elf," Hilarious fun
","At a certain point, Christmas movies started getting dumb. They just ran out of ideas and we started getting films like Jingle All The Way. Elf is the first movie since Bill Murray's Scrooged to do some good for the holdiay's cinematic potential. It's made by smart people and this is an obvious fact that shows itself in every scene. Yes, the plot looks silly and uncreative. An elf is really a human and has to go find his real Dad. It looks dumb. Part of the fun of this movie is how big a surprise it is that it turns out to be great. It's not about plot. It's about humor. Every role is perfectly cast, every scene is designed in terms of achieving maximum comic potential, and Will Ferrell, who is ussually more annoying than not, has finally found the perfect role for his style of humor. This movie uses Christmas right and keeps us laughing so often that it's almost impossible to walk away unsatisfied.",Null,0,2,27 November 2003
Predator," a good action movie
","Sometimes you're really not in the mood to think. A deep movie is the last thing you want. In such cases you want something like an action movie, but most action movies (especially those about monsters, like say Virus), are incredibly stupid. Well, Predator is one that isn't. It's not realistic, but it's still kind of freaky. The action sequences and direction (by Die Hard's John Mctiernan) are terrific, and this is a reasonable role for a guy like Shwartznegger. I hate when guys like him and Keanu Reeves take roles that just don't fit them. Keanau Reeves was right for Point Break and Speed and in the same way, Shwartznegger was right for this movie. The creature has been created by the master, Stan Winston, and is really cool looking. The movie is exciting and fun. It's nothing to praise for excellence, but it's also hard to criticize it. It's simply 'enjoyable'.",Null,0,1,25 July 2000
Pitch Black," not half as good as it looks
","This movie could have been so much better. It's got cool ideas that are played out terribly. The dialogue and acting are real awful and it hurts the movie a great deal. It looked like it could have been more than just the latest 'Deep Rising' and for a few minutes it seemed like it would be. Those minutes were when the visual atmosphere was shown with brilliant lighting and cool camera work. That's, unfortunately, the only thing this movie has going for it. Vin Diesel has a cool look to him, but even he can't handle such terrible dialogue and rework it. The creatures are nothing special at all and the plot really sucks. So the movie looks cool at first, but it grows old and there's nothing else there to back it up. Definately a lousy, disappointing film. A much cooler creature movie was Anaconda.",Null,0,0,6 February 2001
Cold Mountain," Excellent film in all the hugeness of its scope
","This was a terrific movie. It was dramatic, exciting, and at times, even funny (Rene Zellwegger). I guess movies of this time of year, around the oscar season, are all a little bit of everything. This one comes disguised as a romance, but more of a drama than anything else. Yes, there are two stories going on at once. That seems to be another common theme of films of this season. The House of Sand and Fog is two stories, 21 Grams is 3. Cold Mountain is two, and since there is a romance there, it seems to be a little wierd that the members of the couple are split up for the film. It's not half as wierd as it might seem. This is because both stories are very, very good. You'd expect that Nicole Kidman staying at home, learning to take care of her farm would be boring. It isn't. She gets Zellwegger helping her out, sparking up life every time she opens her mouth, and she also gets a band of southern hunters who terrorize them and their neighbors. Meanwhile, we got Jude Law, as Inman, trying to make his way home and being detained at stop after stop. His story reminded me of one of those journey movies like Easy Rider or The Last Detail, where each stop is a story unto itself. One of his better stops involves Natalie Portman as a young mother and a bunch of Northern troops who terrorize her. So, you see how what has the seeds of a romance actually surprises everyone by springing up into a drama with occasional action. The movie might be long, but it doesn't feel it. That's because every frame is edge of your seat compelling. Anthony Minghella knows that his English Patient was boring. Yes it was beautiful and won the best picture oscar, but the general consensus is that it was boring, and he's been trying to make it up to us ever since.",Null,0,0,10 January 2004
Blue Crush," exactly what you would expect
","Saying that Blue Crush is exactly what you would expect is saying that it is neither particularly good nor bad. I guess its better than you would expect, then, since it could so easily be a stupid, cliched film. In many ways it is, but it is not so cliched that you don't enjoy watching it. The plot about the girl who has this big match at the end and meets a guy and starts dating is all a cliche. It doesnt matter. The surfing scenes, including when they just go out surfing to have fun, as opposed to only when they are competing, are fun. The romance might be cliched, but it is still okay. It bothered me that the two friends weren't given real characters of their own, but nobody will accuse this movie of being a smart film. It's brainless fun. If you want something smart, dealing with teenagers, and attractive ladies, check out Risky Business. Blue Crush is more of something that you watch to not have to think about. If youre in that kind of a mood, then this is perfect.",Null,0,0,8 February 2003
Hero," one of the best action movies ever made
","Theres no question that hong kong has the action market cornered when it comes to the greatest action ever put on film. Hard Boiled is, for my money, the greatest action picture ever made, but one has to consider that there are different kinds of action films. There are gun movies (Hard Boiled) and then there are more traditional, sword movies, such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Hero is in the later group. It is better than Crouching Tiger, has far more action and does cooler things. Both movies look amazing with the most beautiful scenery, and both have fantastic action choreography, but Hero just goes a little further. Take, for example, all of the scenes where herds of arrows are launched into the air. Or the two scenes where Jet Li shows off his skills without fighting any opponents (one involves splitting stacks, the other splitting an arrow). The Rashomon-like story is a little like Basic, which is to say that its not particulary easy to follow, but who cares. Its the action that counts in a movie like this, and the action in this movie is out of control. Hard Boiled has the gun movies beat and Hero has the sword movies looking up to it.",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
Life Is Beautiful," amazingly entertaining
","Life is Beautiful is truly an exceptional film. It takes a historical situation, the Holocaust, and puts its characters inside the walls of a concentration camp. This is about all that is true, and so it is historical fiction, but the plot is what is terrific. The first half is Roberto Benini doing a comedy routine and it is slapstick and often hilarious. The second half deals with the holocaust and a plot by which Benini must make up a game to tell his young son in order to shield him from the horrific truth. It is the rules of this game and ways that they are presented that make the movie so remarkable. nearly every important detail that appears in the second half was foreshadowed in the first. This movie is not only very enjoyable, but also extremely smart and creative.",Null,1,3,5 June 2000
The Bridge on the River Kwai," gets great after a while
","This movie had the longest act 1 that I've ever seen. It had to be about an hour long, and it really wasn't that interesting. Act 1s are about setting up the mission and this setup seemed to take forever. Once it was established, however, the movie suddenly went from dull to great. The mission of a team going over to this foreign enemeys camp and blowing up their bridge was pretty cool. The planning of it was handled nicely and then the actual moments of execution were terrific. These moments were the climax of the movie and it became so much more complex than it looked like it would be. Simply pushing a button became a difficult task and this conflict gave the movie a lot of energy. The second half of the movie is incredible. I only wish they hadn't taken so long to get it. Overall, it is worth the effort of being bored in that first half because the second half more than makes up for it.",Null,3,7,26 July 2000
Army of Darkness," fun, yet kind of lame
","This movie kept me watching and wanting to see more, but it never really gave me what I was looking for. What I mean is, it was entertaining, but not great at all. I guess I wanted to see another Evil Dead 2 and this was certainly not it. The humor, which in that film was campy, was corny in this one. The monsters weren't realistic looking in evil dead 2, but they were kind of believable in the sense that you didn't look at them and know exactly what went on to create them. Here, they are too elementary. The bad guy leader is dumb looking and the skeletons would have been so much cooler if they didn't talk. As far as visual creativity, this movie really doesn't have it. The skeletons were done exactly the same decades earlier in Jason and the Aragnaughts. Alas, it was not a bad movie. It kept me watching, hoping that some creatures would be cool and I guess occasionally they were. It's fun, but clearly stupid fun. So if you're in that kind of mood, no thinking, just watching and laughing, then go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you. Fun but definately not funny.",Null,1,3,28 October 2000
Ben-Hur," A long epic that is so good it moves quickly
","When people hear of this movie, it is ussually about the famous chariot race sequence that is incredibly exciting and well done. The fact is, it is but one of many interesting scenes. I get bored easily and that's the reason why it took me so long to see this movie. Because I knew it was long and would be hard to sit through. That's where I was wrong. This movie was not hard to sit through at all. That's because instead of dealing with one particuilar situation, it covers a lot of ground. Prison, slavery, rising to fame and power, family, even religion. I recently saw The Last Temptation of Christ and am so disappointed with how long and dull it felt. This movie is exactly the opposite. It deals with Christ, but he is only a small part of it. Ben Hur is an adventure all around and knows exactly what it is doing. If you have a long movie, you better make sure it is always interesting. This movie does and is. I was pleasantly surprised.",Null,1,2,24 August 2000
Trainspotting," Creative and Raw
","There aren't many movies that both aren't afraid and also strive for intelligence with every move. Happiness was one. Trainspotting is another. It combines an intense desire to not hold anything back with an amazing world of characters who have analyzed life and chosen not to live it. The plot might be as simple, in the abstract, as a character continually trying to kick his heroin habit, but this movie draws that out with tons of humourous scenes and lively characters. Ewan McGregor stars as Marc Renton, the only character who is half rational. We need someone like that to bring us into this world and his voice over which runs throughout the film is a big help to understanding how he feels at various moments. The direction by John Hodge is gutsy and creative. There's one scene, for example, where Renton gets so high, he sinks into the rug and stays there, even when he's in the street, the car, and at the hospital. He doesn't come out of the rug until he comes off of the drugs. This movie does not make drugs look good at all, but at the same time it isn't filled with depression. How can you make a movie about the horrors of drug addiction and not make it sad? It has something to do with throwing intelligent humor into the mix as often as possible. This movie is a masterpiece. It takes so many chances and rocks every one of them.",Null,0,0,17 July 2003
Goodfellas," Uncontrollably Intense
","Goodfellas is seriously one of the best movies ever made. Whenever I read that I think the person liked that film a little too much and it probably wasn't nearly as good as he thought it was. Let me say this: I can't imagine anyone who would not like this film. Everything is perfect. The story, the characters, the environment, the dialogue. It is filled with details and creative scenes and even some superb directing by Martin Scorcese. Even the soundtrack is terrific. Everything is excellent in Goodfellas and that's why it's one of the best movies ever made. It's bloody and filled with curses, but those are not flaws and if you agree with that, then you will love it. If for no other reason one should see it because it is Scorcese's best.",Null,0,0,2 June 2000
The Birds," Suspense through something you never thought could be scary
","Who would think birds can be presented as scary? I knew that they would be attacking before I saw this film, but I never thought I could be frightened by them. Well, Hitchcock makes it happen. He has closeups of birds doing things to people that you would never imagine being possible to do without computers. The beauty of the film isn't the birds, although they put films like Deep Blue Sea that are plastered with effects, to shame. The beauty is the suspense. Hitchcock knows all the tricks to scare an audience. Put them in a small room with no way out because the exits have all been boarded up. Then have the real terror begin. Everyone says he is a genious, but this film proves it more than any other. Sometimes I watch movies of his like Saboteur and say 'What's so great about Hitchcock?' After seeing The Birds, the answer is almost impossible not to see. His timing, music, and ways of framing scenes so that they are completely frightening. If you want a scary movie, don't see the Haunting or the House on Haunted Hill (new versions), see this movie right here. You may not think birds can be scary but after you see it you won't believe how wrong you were.",Null,0,0,8 June 2000
Evil Dead II," truly original and fun
","This movie reminds me of The Blair Witch project. Not that the two films have anything in common except how they were made. With pure originality. The kind that says 'we got our own way of doing things, our own style, and let's see how the public takes it.' if Blair Witch tried to be like films of the past it would never have been the success story that it was. Well, that's exactly how I feel about Evil Dead 2. It didn't try to be like other horror movies. It tried to do its own thing. In fact it didn't even have a tone like other horror movies. It had the blood and semi gore, but it was funny instead of scary. The difference was shockingly great. I had never seen anything quite like it. It had the kind of humor of such movies as The Full Monty and Joe Versus The Volcano where there is nothing particularly funny except the way it feels. The environment. No one liners, just hysterical setups. That's comedy at its best. Where its not tailored so everybody will like it or even get it, but so those who do get it see how amazing it is. You'll either love this one or hate it. If you hate it than I hate you because you are the kind of person who keeps restrictions on the film industry. The kind of person who wants every movie to be relatively the same. Well, I applaud people who make movies like this or like Arlington Road and have visions that haven't been seen before and are risky yet clever. Evil Dead 2 is remarkable because it knows how to have fun and yet it didn't learn it from anywhere. It came up with its own way to do it. In other words there are a bunch of reasons why this film is worthwhile and excellent.",Null,0,0,30 October 2000
