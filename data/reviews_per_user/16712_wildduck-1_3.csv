Vertigo," dream vs. reality
","Warning contains Spoilers - Hitchcock beautifully explores the need for illusion in Vertigo. Scottie, played by James Stewart, is a man who drifts without direction, who can't make up his mind about anything. He is deeply dissatisfied with the real world. He seemingly has a choice between two women. Midge is open, practical, and unexciting  a representative of life as it is. Madeleine is exotic, mysterious, complex, a perfect fantasy figure. He falls in love with Madeleine and lets her lead him into her world of drama and illusion. She becomes, for the audience as well as for him, the wish fulfillment of the dream woman. Two-thirds of the way through the movie, having strongly tied us to this character, Hitchcock betrayals us  she dies suddenly and inexplicably, we are disappointed and confused. We are, surprisingly as disoriented as Scottie is. Soon after, Hitchcock explains what has happened, and we realize that we have been deceived, with Scottie, by a cheap trick. Neither audience nor hero wants to believe it. We both want her back. We prefer the illusion, false as it is, to the reality. Through Scottie we are made to see and feel the consequences of rejecting real people for a dream. Judy, a graceless, uninteresting girl, has been impersonating Madeleine all along. Still obsessed with Madeleine, Scottie forces Judy to recreate her role for him. At first she resists, wanting to be loved for herself, but then, like so many of us, she agrees to conform to his image of her. Otherwise she will lose him.",10,7,8,28 October 2005
Citizen Kane," the music
","With the help of the brilliant musical director, Bernard Herrmann, who had never worked on a film before, Welles Expands the use of music to build and structure his film. The same musical phrases will recur at seemingly unrelated moments, tying the scenes together. Or be subtly changed each time they appear anew. A melody such as the 'What is his name?' tune is sung vigorously at the Inquirer Party, is heard again played more aggressively at the political rally, becomes sadder after the election defeat, and reappears behind the credits. The breakfast scene between Kane and Emily was cut to correspond to the music, Welles patterning the montage of shots, one shot successively superimposed on and then replacing another, to follow the movement of what Herrmann called his 'ballet suite.' Music had seldom been used so cleverly or given such an important role in a film before.",10,5,8,27 October 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Mythological Documentary
","**warning contains spoilers** In 2001: A Space Odyssey humanity has become so completely mechanized that computers are more human then people. There are still some comic elements  the scientist posing for a conventional tourist picture against the moon monolith, Major Poole burning his surprisingly still sensitive flesh on a totally computerized meal  but this is not a satire. Society has gone too far for that. Our civilization has come to an end, turned flat and weary and stale. There is no energy, no purpose, no creative intelligence. Each individual is merely a bored, faceless cog in a technological system. Kubrick conceived this film as a 'mythological documentary,' a modern legend of the origin and future of humankind. It is both realistic as a photo-essay and imaginary as a fable. It is essentially a religious movie. Replacing the traditional God of world religions is a cosmic intelligence that influences human evolution at certain pivotal moments. When the ape has evolved as far as it can as an instinctual animal, the first monolith appears, giving the power of creative intelligence that produces the tool-weapon. When that tool has been sophisticated as far as the human mind can conceive-the dramatic cut from the bone thrown into the air to the spaceship resembling it symbolizes this development-the monolith appears again to force humanity on to the next stage. Major Bowman, lacking character and personality as he is, still retains enough feeling to try to rescue his colleague, enough ingenuity to reenter the spaceship after he has been locked out, and enough dedication and courage to continue on his journey, to be chosen as the new human being. On the trip to Jupiter he transcends space, and once arrived there, he transcends time, watching himself age in minutes. As he dies, the monolith appears, he reaches out to it in greeting and gratitude, and is reborn into a creature that transcends his previous humanity. The change from human to Star Child is as drastic as from ape to human: the Star Child will continue our evolution with a radically new intelligence.",10,0,2,4 November 2005
