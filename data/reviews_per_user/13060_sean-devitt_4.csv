Skyfall," Time for Craig to get out while there's still applause.
","After looking at the rave reviews I seriously wonder if I saw the same movie. This isn't all that good. Maybe critics are just relieved that it's easier to follow than QoS.Poor Craig has landed the role of a lifetime but has once again been told to play Bond as a thug (sorry blunt instrument)jumping from fight sequence to fight sequence. Am the only one tired of motorcycle chases through crowds and fights on tops of trains? I don't blame Craig at all. He isn't writing the script and he's just an actor being paid to do a job. I think it's clear he's not happy in the role and if reports of him wanting out are accurate (admittedly dated before the big box office of this movie)then I don't blame him at all.The only acting he gets to do is when he's getting close ups and breathing deeply to show... some sort of emotional depth?My other big problem with Skyfall is 'M'. Although I agree that Dame Judi Dench is a great actress I have always felt that she has been horribly written. The character always felt forced and tried too hard to show she was strong and ruthless but to me it always looked contrived and silly. In reality she wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes as head of MI6. As well as routinely insulting, undermining and threatening her most loyal agent in every movie, she has also presided over MI6 HQ being blown up twice, got herself kidnapped, risked funding terrorism in Casino Royale,failing to get Le Chiffre, not knowing MI6 had been thoroughly penetrated by Quantum and risking her life in the field instead of staying at her desk in London and checking stuff! For me the best part of the movie was when Mallory played by Ralph Fiennes (real James Bond fans will know who Mallory is) has the conversation with her that should have happened many movies ago!In my opinion 'M' shouldn't be a character at all in the Bond universe. The characters should be 1) Bond 2) Main villain 3) Bond girl.Unfortunately Skyfall is pretty much about 'M' (who shouldn't be a character but has been given one)and her relationship with Bond (who should be given a character but hasn't got one). We have a villain in the form of Javier Bardem who seems to have drawn inspiration from Christmas Panto and the Joker in the Dark Knight. I guess they needed someone to light up the dullness and the nihilism of the reboot Bond.Some have compared Skyfall to the 'The Dark Knight Rises' which I can see but Bond has always taken things from other movies. What does bother me is how they even stole whole lines from TDKR such as 'There's a storm coming'. It's not even subtle. To say I found Skyfall disappointing is an understatement. Bond is not a character, 'M' shouldn't have been given a movie to herself and Javier Bardem looks like he's just happy to collect his paycheck and return to real acting in another movie.At the moment this movie is getting great reviews but I think that time will not be so kind to this movie.",4,14,29,27 November 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America the new Superman
","This movie was better than I thought it would be.Captain America has usually been done badly on screen and there's the political problem of how to portray a man called Captain America in a world where many people don't like America or its foreign policy. The usual answer is to have everyone talk about how anachronistic he is, how his values no longer apply, how the world is no longer black and white and blah blah.This movie does just the same but fortunately it gets on with things and keeps moving before you have time to spot the problems. Chris Evans looks uncomfortable and I'm not sure if that's because the character is supposed to be uncomfortable in the setting of the movie or because the actor knows he's the C list character in a B list franchise (The Avengers have the comic book characters that other movie studios didn't want). I will give the benefit of the doubt and say Chris Evans played the confused superman well.Scarlett Johansson gets to do a lot more and fills the role of the comedy sidekick as well as action hero. Pairing her up with Chris Evans was a good idea and it worked well. Robert Redford stands around doing his man from the 1970s stuff. Samuel L Jackson is the same as always although he is starting to blend into the scenery. The other characters are competent and none of the performances were bad.The action was fast paced and more suited to an action thriller than a comic book movie and that was a good thing. People are getting shot in large numbers in this movie and there was a seriousness that I appreciated. There were times when Johanssons character appeared to be in real danger and looked scared.The problems. After the destruction of New York (the Avengers), the damage to London (Thor Dark World), the terrorism in Iron Man and the money spent on Shield (the cost of those hover carriers!)the economy in this universe must be in a shambles and the population traumatized by Alien invasion, men mutating into green monsters and Shield being blown up in front of their eyes. There seem to be no consequences following these huge events. Society seems to move along fine and the shops look full.Finally with Man of Steel showing Superman to be a brooding over powerful ET who smashes up cities, thinks he's a god and threatens the military it seems like Captain America is the new superman. He's the one who now promotes truth, justice and the American way. Give him Tony Stark's suit.",7,0,1,25 May 2014
Prometheus," Art and Science don't always mix.
","The first time I saw Prometheus I thought it wasn't as bad as some were saying. The cinematography was great and the performance of Michael Fassbender made it a largely enjoyable experience. I didn't like the 'scientists' Shaw and Holloway at all but I tried to endure.Then after a second viewing the plot holes and poor dialogue that others had pointed out became apparent. My third viewing was on a flight from Seoul to Taipei. On the small screen the great cinematography wasn't there to save the movie. I now think this is close to awful but I gave it a 4/10 because of cinematography and Fassbender.The problems are too obvious to point out. From watching Ridley Scott being interviewed it was clear he thought he was making a masterpiece. Whether it was hubris or self delusion I don't know but one thing that became clear was that he had no grasp of the material.Scott is an artist and he's good at his stuff. He's not so good at science. This was also clear in Alien and Blade Runner. With Alien it didn't matter because it was just a horror movie in space. With Blade Runner the poor science, story telling and editing was hidden by the praise of critics telling us that it was a classic and that anyone who didn't think so was an idiot. The poor dialogue, confusing storyline and the lack of a clear ending were all signs of genius at work. Forget the fact that no one in the movie knew what it was about and that the studio execs were horrified by the final product. Obviously they were all idiots and didn't understand the majesty of the movie! I think that's what Scott thought he could get away with in Prometheus. Any plot holes would be covered over by the critics and his fans. Scientific inaccuracies could be dismissed as nitpicking, poor character development could be explained away by 'symbolism' and a stupid ending as just the set up for a sequel.As for the characters. As I said Shaw and Holloway were awful. I was so disappointed that Noomi Rapace's character survived the movie. She didn't deserve it. In Alien, Ripley deserved to survive. She was the most sensible, level headed and resourceful of the crew. Shaw was written as a blind and arrogant fanatic. At the end of the movie she was still a blind and arrogant fanatic. No development at all.I would write about the other characters but there weren't any.",4,4,6,3 December 2012
Godzilla," A forty minute movie with padding
","I gave this a 6 out of 10 because the effects were great and Bryan Cranston gave a decent performance that kept me interested.In the end it looked like they made a good forty minute movie and then thought 'Oh no, this movie needs to be at least 2 hours, what can we do to pad it out?' As others have pointed out the movie goes downhill after Cranston's character ends up in a body bag after 30 odd minutes. The moment they zipped him up I felt that any chances the movie had of being great got zipped up with him.The military characters were a complete waste of screen time. Perhaps they were there because the armed forces gave some assistance to the production of the movie. Maybe the military sponsored parts of it to boost recruitment or maybe they needed to pad things out before they reveal Godzilla. I have no idea what they thought they were doing but every time the movie cut to the soldiers I felt the movie deflate. I don't wish to single out actors but Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character was so flat it almost killed the movie stone dead. I am not sure what was wrong but something was definitely missing there. Maybe he was told to play it flat in contrast to Cranston who played his father but I think that I may be giving him too much credit.You could almost tell where the studio executives stepped in and messed with the movie. 'Hey, we need a wife and kid, the dog has to escape and the 'lead' character has to save another kid (to show he cares and he is a good father figure). Delete the scene with Akira Takarada (no one knows who he is anyway) and show Elizabeth Olsen working in a hospital (she is a caring female character so please care about her)). Don't spend time with the monsters show a halo jump that leads to nothing. Don't show the monsters but have a ticking clock on a nuke that goes nowhere. Hire Ken Watanabe and have him do nothing too' The movie was very frustrating. They had fantastic special effects and could have showcased Godzilla as never before but they simply teased the audience and wasted a golden opportunity because of the Hollywood desire to push family values, pets and the American military.",6,1,3,24 May 2014
