Moneyball," It is not a baseball movie
","If you want a sports true story like 'The Fighter' or a sports themed movie like 'Win Win or 'Million Dollar Baby' that is not what this movie is. This movie seemed like a documentary about statistics. I thought Brad Pitt did a great job. But the telling of the story seemed so flat. It had a very depressing feel, from the scenery to the interaction between characters. I love true stories and biographies though this may have been very accurate, I just felt very down throughout the movie; but I was not moved. The loyalty was there in the story but I did not experience it.The actress that plays the daughter also was very good.",4,2,4,30 January 2012
