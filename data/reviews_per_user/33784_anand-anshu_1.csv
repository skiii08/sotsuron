Requiem for a Dream," This movie is Inspiring ( Makes you wanna Quit Smoking too for your Health)
","Few days back I was thinking of trying Marijuana ..often called the 'Gateway Drug'..but GOD saved me( and a friend too.. who suggested me this movie) & before I could try that, I saw this movie.I was SHOCKED to the core & made a promise to myself that I won't even think of trying drugs EVER!The plight of the four characters of this movie which is depicted so ruthlessly at the end of the movie is really something that i would remember for a long time. I could not sleep the night I saw this movie. It's plainly disturbing.I wonder how a movie can make you so cold from inside.After I saw the movie it felt to me that I have frozen deep within.This movie is a SPIRITUAL Experience at some level.I smoke a lot & to tell the fact ,I did not even smoke for about 2 days after seeing this movie & I am thinking of QUITTING.Recommended for everybody who is sick of the clich√© plots & happy endings.",10,2,4,18 January 2005
