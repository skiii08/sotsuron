Parasite," Money is so kind, and money can iron everything
","1.General review
South Korea has been leading for 30 years on the road to pursuing art and resonating with the audience.
The traditional view is that literary films are films that are more reflective of profound thoughts, but they also mean a good and tangible experience. Commercial films are just the opposite. Nowadays, the Korean film industry has already had a work that combines depth and perception.
At this time, Chinese movies are still drifting away in the mud of money.2.The appearance of breakthrough represents more mature thinking
The film depicts mainly class differences and divisions. But the most core breakthrough is the opposite of good and evil.
In the traditional film of the reaction to the class, the rich are always portrayed as rich and poor, and the poor are always diligent and kind. The film is the opposite. The rich man is a hard-working woman who has a family and his children are not awkward; the poor are savage and sneaky.
The reconciliation of this character image shows that the film's creative thinking is more mature, and it is no longer necessary to deliberately highlight the theme through class opposition. And through more realistic role positioning, with the plot, to communicate with the audience.3.Understatement and into the wood
This film is used to distinguish the class, the most important thing is the smell. You don't need a luxury shoe bag, you don't need to travel Shopping, just such a label that has been neglected and yet vivid, has become a finishing touch.
What is the smell of living in a dark and damp basement for a long time? The film gives a more appropriate description, 'cooking the taste of the rag'. This distinction does not help the audience not applaud.
The whole film did not deliberately render the hardships and hardships of the poor. It's just the smell, with the long ladder in the rainstorm, the sewage filled in the basement, it seems to be understated but it is three times.
As a negative example, you can compare the 'Taste of Money' (2012), I believe that everyone will be able to feel the shackles of spilling the screen, how boring.4.Calm, is the biggest gap
After completing the division of the two classes by smell, how to show the gap between the two classes? The director gave a unique answer: calm.
When the male master stood at the window and looked at the hilarious party on the grass outside the window, he could not help but tell the difference between the two classes: calmly.
The version of the poor is given from the father's mouth: 'People should not have plans, and they will not go wrong without planning.'
This kind of contrast is not obvious when you look at it, but when you are fine, you understand the difference in attitudes between life and the scorpio between the two classes.5.Performance, icing on the cake
The performance of the two actors of the father and mother in the film can be said to be the icing on the cake.
Song Kangxi In the basement and driving, the deliberate expression of self-esteem can make the audience feel the inferiority of the inner character of the wrapped person, and thus can end the anger and stab the president. This is the anger of the little man who was dismissed. In particular, the one that turned back after the president of the thorny center was full of confusion, confusion, and helplessness.
Zhang Huizhen's mother, when she was drinking in the rainy night, had a very wonderful performance. The expression was in a few seconds from scare to anger to fear of the last laugh, and every trembling of the face muscles was a play.6.Not perfect, there are also disadvantages
The whole plot is divided into three sections. The plots with some fine details can be trimmed in the middle, and the main line is not helpful.
In addition, I don't really like the end of the film. Father escaped from reality and how do you know when to pass information? Reuniting the sun seems to be a reflection of the darkness of reality, but the actual painting is superfluous.7.Written at the end
There is a stone in the play that symbolizes the flow of class, which was eventually discarded by his son.
For the contemporary society, poverty is the only disease. Stone is not an antidote.",8,4,14,18 August 2019
