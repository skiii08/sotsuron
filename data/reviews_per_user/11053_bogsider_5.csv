The Ring," It is scary. IT IS.
","You see some viewers may not know this, but horror/suspense  movies are like soft drinks,  you  know  'Best Served Chilled'  well, for a 'chilling horror/suspense movie experience, they are  'Best Viewed In The Dark  Late At Night  Alone'.   Sure, you could watch this movie in the middle of the afternoon with a group of buddies,  the phone ringing , the dog playing with its ball on the living room floor, the sounds of  kids running around outside, no it wouldn't be scary, of course it wouldn't, no movie would. Some who found this 'Boring', 'Not scary', 'I wasn't scared' etc...blabla..etc.. could do well to see it again, the way in which it should be seen, might find it quite a  different experience  -  'I wonder'. Horror /suspense movies differ from others. By the way, IT IS a very chilling and frightening movie, something which is very rare.",Null,1,1,12 June 2003
The 13th Warrior," especially for those who like Tolkien or Conan
","It's wonderful to see a movie like this , amongst all the endless nonsense that's churned out onto film reel,  this is such a refreshing change.  The enemy  very dark and menacing, always a foreboding feeling throughout the whole movie - done so well.  'Buliwyf'  the lead warrior was certainly a ' real hero' a very convincing character and at the same time modestly played. The setting,  the characters, the battles, the enemy .....all done ever so well - A true fantasy  movie free of nonsense.  This movie is especially one for those that like fantasy  along the lines of Tolkien or Conan. 9+",Null,0,0,6 January 2003
The Godfather: Part II," old men and lots of talk
","I suppose some of the locations were ok. Old buildings and also lots of old men speaking English or Italian you don't really care what they're talking about, nothing of any interest 'trust me', but they have an awful lot to say, and your sitting there voluntarily watching and ...haha...listening to this. Some past DeNiro scenes. Then there are the dance halls ballroom dancing and all that more talk there, and by that time perhaps someone you don't care about gets shot then quite a bit more talk old men and young Paccino a coffee and talk and a couple of old men you've not seen yet are walking and talking - yeah real deep meaning full stuff a real cinematic experience . you've seen the first Godfather and  read how good this second part is. Wow! I ought to write a 700 page book about this movie with a title of  'Godfathers and Movie Makers' or something yeah -  really stimulating and memorable. An education in fact.",Null,1,3,12 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," gimli - such a shame
","Awesome this movie is - yes, follows on well from the great Fellowship of the Ring - Frodo, Aragorn, Legolas etc. ever convincing great characters, realistic, the depictions of Mordor OH MY! but what ever did happen to Gimli. I'm sorry to say that the pent-up little tough dwarf from the first movie is gone and is replaced by a walking taking comic with supposed to be funny one liners and silly antics more suitable to cheap sitcoms and worthless talk shows, the  Gimli character keeps bringing you back from your graphic trip to Middle-Earth and tells you this is all just a movie - that's all it is - how sad. One minute of editing could soon change everything, though. Happy new year Gimli.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Casino Royale," boring, bore, boredom, boring
",after an hour it just occurred to me that i hadn't the slightest idea what this movie was about nor did i really care to know either so i hadn't been paying attention! Why not? cos' without realizing it i'd been continuously glancing at the remote control and thinking it's either time to turn this off or FFW this .............. - everything here you've seen Jason Statham do before ............. one good scene though - the Aston Martin swerve and roll at high speed - impressive camera views there - can't think of anything else except the spooky drowning at the end ................. just watch the Transporter movies instead if you're looking for some entertainment out of a mindless action movie,3,5,8,21 June 2007
