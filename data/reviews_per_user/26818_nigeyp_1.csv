Skyfall," Lazy & script heavy, more like a TV drama than Bond
","With the exception of the opening sequence I felt let down by this film. It was not the best Bond film ever by a long way, taking Daniel Craig out of the question - as he is faultless - Sam Mendes took lazy decisions that are very surprising and disappointing. I thought it was fairly lame and dialogue heavy, at the expense of action. With Bond we live the film through his eyes, we have to see how he escapes from impossible situations - but Sam Mendes just left him in situations and then cut to him walking into the next scene with no explanation! lazy film making and I expect more from Bond. We need to be with him every time he escapes and be amazed at his inginuity, but we didn't get that. He was left at the bottom of the Loch, he fired a flare towards the ice (winter in Scotland, yet light in London at 6pm? hello?)....then cut to him walking into the church. How did he get out? Also lots of story lines that don't make sense, like the tube train / the HEAD of MI5 making her escape ...at a snails pace...across a field...WITH A TORCH!!?? them making their way secretly to Scotland...but laying a false trail supposedly by their satnav, but following the same route they made anyway...yet no-one at MI5/6 followed them? a succession of contrived nonsense. Daniel Craig 10/10 but the film as a whole didn't live up to the hype for me.",5,6,14,20 January 2013
