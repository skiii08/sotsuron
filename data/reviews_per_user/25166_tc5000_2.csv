Deja Vu," Veritable feast bar none
","But never mind me gorging myself on the cinema food, what about the film ? Well it started at a decent pace and held it's own, a comfortable cruise through familiar territory in a different vehicle driven by a veteran chauffeur. I overdid it on the pepsi and needed the toilet after 25 minutes, held on as long as i could but had to go, upon my return i sat feeling a lot more comfortable but very confused, this movie requires your utmost attention and i had returned to the wrong screening but it took me 10 minutes to work that out ! Even so the animated movie i had sat in on helped the film along considerably. As most scenarios have now been well and truly covered it was a pleasure to enjoy an intelligent angle on a familiar experience, if you enjoy the latest series of Doctor Who then this will be a film to watch. The acting although not top notch, does not detract from the plot. Somehow i can't help feeling i'd seen it before.",Null,0,1,17 December 2006
V for Vendetta," never mind the bollo***, heres the future
","This is a punk film in every sense from the banned classical music to natalie portmans haircut, punk originally set out to get itself outlawed yet ironically this film shows what the punks of 1976 could have become had they become the law, maybe they are ? and it's too late, a future banned classic maybe.Watch and listen between the lines..... Natalie portman is the complete actress with shades of Jodie foster, Sigourney weaver and er, that girl out of Leon ? Cool. Equally admirable is that this film has a true British quality to it that reminds us that although we are a small island we do tend to make a world wide impact from time to time and not all of them regrettable. I simply sat spellbound by this film wondering what old punks i knew had made their way sufficiently enough in todays society to make all this possible, then i phoned a curry.1984/10",10,11,21,6 July 2006
