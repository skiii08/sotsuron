Love and Death," The funniest film ever made.
","Screw MP and the Holy Grail. Though that was funny and got a cult of losers who could quote every line from it, it has nothing on Love and Death, Woody Allen's funniest movie. I can't remember a single point in this movie where i actually stopped laughing to even breath. The throwaway jokes in this film are better than the grade a material of even some good comedies. A definite must-see.",8,1,2,11 September 2003
