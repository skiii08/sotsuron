Black Swan," Perfect background score, brilliant enacting
","A second-generation ballet dancer, being trained by her mom, and who has always been known in her dancing classes to be the ideal one, the one who gives it all in to reach perfection, no matter if it puts them in harm's way. Natalie Portman does justice to the ballerina part, supported by her tender and fragile body. She appears to be the best one they could've cast in Hollywood. Mila Kunis as supporting actress is truly welcome with applause. At some point, Whiplash(2014) seems to draw some inspiration for its scenes from this movie(Whiplash won the Academy Award for Best Movie Drama in that year), if we compare. Moving along the plot, some intricacies in the mind of the character Nina gets along which daunt her the whole story line.Would she be able to fight her own problems? Would she get along with what is happening?It's a closely knit plot differentiating between what is real and what's in our head. So, one could guess that this movie gets along the lines of Fight Club, or InsomniaWatch and tell me you're taken aback with the sheer content this movie has to offer.",9,1,3,8 October 2016
