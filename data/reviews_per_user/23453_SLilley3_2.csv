Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a success
","If you are not a Star Wars fan, you probably wouldn't have liked this movie. Alot of people I know, saw this movie because of how hyped it was, and came back from the theater disgusted. That was their own fault. This is not another 'Shakespear in Love' type flick, you really have to keep an open mind about it. And for the other 50 Million of us who loved the origional triliogy, this movie couldn't have come at a better time. In the wake of cheesy summer movies with no bang, (Not to mention story, or acting) this was a success.",9,7,9,6 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In an attempt to stop the Trade Federation from overpowering the planet Naboo, two Jedi take a action packed trip across the galaxy.
","I have never been so excited about a movie before in my life. For months, all was right with the world. Sitting in the theater on opening night, I was blown away every step of the way. From the opening title crawl to the ending celebration, it was amazing. See this movie, you will not be disappointed.",9,7,9,19 July 1999
