The New World," Malick's wonderful visual poetry with unsatisfying script
","Reading the reviews describing this movie clearly reveals that it was badly marketed. Perhaps it needed to be. However it is intriguing how far people's expectations differed from the actual film. I would have assumed that Malick was enough of an auteur for most people to know what they were expecting. Evidently not; his name doesn't seem to appear on the cover of my DVD...Badlands, Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line are amongst the most important cinematic treats out there, so why is this only an 8 out of 10 film? Well, strangely, The New World appears as both his most compromised and his most meandering work. Not a good mix, especially for the *ahem* 'average' cinema goer. The seemingly compromised element, in my opinion, lies in the rating. Malick's magic rawness is just a little too timid here. The film simply isn't as terrifying in its depiction of violence and deprivation as it needs to be. Also the softly-softly-she's-underage approach to the central love affair doesn't have very far to go after the initial electrifying encounters.The meandering is not a problem for anyone with half a brain. It's just not quite as satisfying a narrative as it could have been. The way Malick has explored themes in previous films is what makes him a genuine artist. Here that approach starts slowly and doesn't quite hit his previous highwater mark.Malick's use of editing, almost as prose uses tenses, was first really started in Days of Heaven. By The Thin Red Line the juxtapositions this effect created made for stunning, eloquent cinema. Here, though, they serve to muddle character motivations. You could blame Colin Farrell for not giving enough but I think he does a very solid job. No, I think this is just a plain script issue. A script that might have been well served by a touch more intention.However, there are moments in this film that, unless you're braindead or have no soul, will catch your breath at their beauty. This isn't some wry, overly intellectual piece of art; no this is straight to the gut, sobbing like a baby art. The genuinely magical interaction between light, sound, music and performance is as haunting as ever. Q'Oriaanka Kilcher delivers something amazing here; fresh with amazing innocence and deep, knowing sorrow. Farrell conveys a similar depth of joy and sadness that really makes their love believable.Malick's The New World is that rare cinema treat: art made at a Hollywood budget and it deserves to be seen for that alone, even though it is not his most satisfying work. The story simply muddles character motivation instead of complicating it. If you're willing to exchange that for a sensitive collection of poetic moments you'll be happy. If not do not see it. Simple as.It is sad that so many people hate it, quite what they expected I don't know. An action epic with goodies and baddies? Surely not... No one's that stupid... Are they?",Null,0,1,5 November 2006
The Village," Lots of Good, Some Bad
","The Village is an interesting film, in so much as it was still surprising after the signature 'twist'. Instead it remains in the illusion and sat watching the credits was a strangely emotional feeling as a result. Bravo for a subtle sized resolution, it really hit the spot for me. Also the score is gorgeous.The bad? Well the exposition and set-ups of the plot were just a little too clumsy for me. The plot could have been built on much more solid foundations in my opinion. Also Adrian Brody's character could have done with a bit more depth to explain what he does. Flashbacks in this case stifle the pace but do keep you intrigued; to the point of frustration. The dialogue worked sometimes but not others, perhaps it should have cracked a bit in the elders? Overall though this is very worthwhile movie. The note it finishes on for its theme of innocence, I found quite striking. DO NOT expect any real horror movie conventions though, you've got the wrong film for that. Oh and that score in DTS is worth the rental even if you have doubts. Watch. Make your own mind up.",Null,0,0,19 June 2006
The Football Factory," Yet another Brit flick that is like watching a first draft script
","You can't make a good film from a bad script as is the case here. The script is just underdeveloped, come the end of the film you just don't get that 'satisfaction' feeling that you're supposed to, that you need to. Why? Because the themes are badly explored, plot trails go nowhere and, most of all, we can't really get a hook into any of these characters. Even with hard-nosed content like this we should still be able to care about someone. Here the opposite it is true and in the film's final moments we even find ourselves cheering a character we've only briefly glimpsed.A good example is the Bill character overhearing a plot by the other head guys to keep him out for being unreliable. This dramatic moment of undoing for the character should signal later events but nothing comes of it. There are lots of these unpaid moments which amounts to poor scripting.The British representation is very true to life. It looks so much like the Britain we all know yet never rises above it enough to become a proper movie. Obviously the budget is less than an episode of EastEnders and the fact it looks to be shot on video doesn't help. You can't really have dream moments in a film like this, it's just not 'magical' enough. The grandad subplot is also completely at odds with the rest of the film's unrepentant hooligan theme leaving really messy results.The dialogue in this film is too pedestrian, lacking comedy or sparkle. The narration is of the most intrusive and expository type. The 'action' scenes weren't a patch on Gangs of New York. The unrepentant themes are jarred badly by the closing moments and there is no real exploration of why these normal people need to do this.If the Football Factory had been funnier and less afraid of the tragedy it might have been a great film. As is you're just left with one of those messy, mismatched genre films that is evidence of the British Film Industry's consistent mistake of filming too raw and unsatisfying a script.",Null,4,7,22 August 2006
Love Actually," The worst British film in living memory.
","This film is as bad as cinema gets, I left the screen in utter disbelief at just how terrible it was.This is a film made for people who don't go to the cinema. People who don't want to be surprised by a movie, people who want it to be EXACTLY as it lays it out in the trailer. It's the most contrived product of the British film industry that I can remember. Every character is derivative of the actors' previous roles and actually damages them as a result. Watch the trailer - there's very little more in the finished film.Might the film be too mushy? Heck let's throw in some of the usual Dickie Curtis toffee English swearing stuff to give it a bit of credibility. The use of the intertwined stories is pathetic as they are barely tied together by anything solid. Taken alone each individual strand is worthless - recognise the geeky guy off My Family? In his story he can't get a girlfriend in England so goes to America where chicks love the accent, he pulls there - end of story (although the word story barely counts.) The British/American integration perhaps represents the most contrived aspect especially the oh so very convincing World Leaders.Hey Hugh Grant does a funny dance!! Fantastic stuff!! Honest!! This is with a doubt the worst cinema going experience I've ever had. It took me six months before I could face going back.I enjoyed Four Weddings and was fond of Notting Hill and there's no denying the acting talent trying to make something, anything of this awful unfunny mess but it just feels like you're watching a first draft script of a really pointless idea. The attempts at the cultural context of 9/11 are so toe curlingly embarrassing it hurts. Curtis is a bad director by any standard. This is TV on the big screen, a film made for people to stick on at Christmas in the 'background' - it was made to be bland and meaningless.The worst thing though is that Richard Curtis knows that this is a bad film. He chooses Bill Nighy's ageing rock star as his 'vehicle' - the character is releasing a cover of 'Love is All Around' which is a rehash of Curtis' Four Weddings soundtrack song (much as this film is a rehash) At one point Nighy's character admits that the song is awful - but who cares it Christmas? It is obvious that this directly represents Curtis' own view on the film... It's rubbish but hey it's Christmas.Curtis is laughing all the way to the bank, laughing at everyone buying into his 'rubbish' product.",Null,23,43,12 February 2005
