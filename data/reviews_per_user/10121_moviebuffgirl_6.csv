Catch Me If You Can," Fantastic true-story, lousy movie
","This fascinating story & fantastic cast are wasted in this sloppy self-indulgent slice of 'Shpielberg.' A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.",4,2,8,12 January 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," FANTASTIC! Laugh your knickers off! A great surprise!
","I couldn't make it through 5 pages of Hellen Fielding's novel, which seemed to me superficial and self-pitying. And Renee Zellwiger has never been one of my favorite actresses. So I flicked on the movie expecting to only watch a few minutes before sleep. Instead I was laughing myself senseless half the night!! Renee was absolutely pitch-perfect--I think she should have won an Oscar. Her comic timing was PERFECT. The whole movie was so  well-directed and well-edited that I don't think there is a moment that I would change.  The sound-track was amazing, and like the movie laugh-inspiring and energizing. From the script to the cinematography to the details of costuming, everything was FANTASTIC. All of the supporting characters were also well-fleshed out and riotous.  WATCH IT NOW!",9,0,0,10 October 2001
Being John Malkovich," Fabulous Mind F***
","Most people who hear the premise smile and scratch their heads-- clever, brilliant, bizarre. I went in hearing the hype and expected a good flick, but was skeptical. However, my critical glasses crashed to the floor because I was laughing so hard. It was funny, ironic, and idiosyncratic. I expected it to be bizarre, and thought provoking, but I didn't expect it to be so goddamn hilarious. If you breathe oxygen and have ever fantasized about leaving your body for, say, 15 minutes, you should check this out. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are both virtually unrecognizable, and here dramatically redeemed for flaky flops they've been in the past. John Malkovich is superb as expected, the writing is kooky beyond belief, cinematography interesting, direction dead on. Fabulous. Thumbs, hell, all fingers, toes too-- way up.",10,0,0,4 February 2000
The Princess Bride," Adventure, true-love, shmaltzy wonderful comedy
","A total cult classic! I've seen this movie about 20 times since it came out. But its so good there are definately support groups for people like me. If only I could stop watching it long enough to get to one... Wildly romantic, wonderfully funny, fantastic, creative, with great characters (Billy Crystal's mad max is classic). And the script is a gem. I'm not going to argue it as high art, but it is as great campy fun as it gets. And it is a very good movie, too. An all fingers and toes up affair.",10,1,2,8 May 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," See it! But what's up with the ending?
","The action in this movie is explosively beautiful. Quite simply, its a violent and magical ballet the likes of which I have never seen before. The script is taught, the acting pitch-perfect, and the cinematography some of the most lush in recent years. 	But, WHATS UP WITH THAT ENDING? It was a real artistic and dramatic letdown. Although the tall-tale nature of the story necessitates the suspension of disbelief early on (somewhere around the first Spiderman impersonation, where one of the fighters runs up a wall), aside from the fight scenes the rest of the movie maintained an element of reality. The creative direction was so masterfull that it transformed potentially ludicrous fight scene where characters leapt like flying monkeys between trees into something of acrobatic beauty and near artistry.	Sure, my desire for a feel-good American Holywood schlocky ending was somewhat deflated (I'll leave out why for those of you who havent seen it yet). But what I'm most upset about is the very last scene between Jen and Lo--not the dialogue, which is forgivably predictable, but the image of Jen flying off into the world, spinning like some music video image. She looked like a milk bottle, and the ridiculousness of the over-the-top literalism of the fable turning into reality just left me with a lingering bitter taste despite what was ultimately a feast of a movie. 	Does anyone know about Chinese legends/folk history or what the sources for this movie were? Im really perplexed about the decisions in the last quarter, the directions that each of the parallel love stories took.

"Girl, Interrupted"," Brief critique-- 9/10 Excellent drama and lyric insight
","I came to the film with low expectations.  I was simply stunned by how good it was.Angelina Jolie is an absolutely PHENOMENAL actress. Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. But unlike show-stoppers like Marissa Tomei in 'My Cousin Vinnie,' merely shines the brightest light in a luminescent cast.The cinematography was innovative, but not distractingly so-- 'Girl Interupted' shines primarily for its dramatic power, not as a mind-blowing work of art. It will not explode your vision of the mundane world in the same way that 'American Beauty' might, but it will certainly probe you to question your way of seeing the world-- at least psychologically.Winona Ryder challenged my preconception of her, and proved herself as more than a pretty-girl. Her performance was convincing as Suzanna, a confused high-school graduate who is eloquent and insightful on paper yet unable to a rticulate her own desperate melancholy.The movie takes place primarily in the women's ward of a mental institution and follows the dynamic friendship between Lisa (Jolie's character) and Suzanna. Lisa is a kinetic, dynamic personality who cuts right to the 'truth' of things. Her 'truth' knows no boundaries and she is a controlling person prone to violence. Her piercing insights about people and social recklessness led to her to be institutionalized as a sociopath.This is not a depressing film. Rather, it is suprisingly life-affirming. Not cloying, not sacherine, but not inpenetrably dark, either.  Anyone seeking an angst-ridden portrayal of abuses in mental institutions should check out Jack Nicholson's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.'This film has little of the violent anger of that old classic. Yet it does echo some of the ebulience, the defiance of authority and embracing of freedom at sometimes incalculable cost.Performances by Whoppie Goldberg (in a serious and nuanced role) and Vanessa Redgrave were excellent, as expected.With the exception of a few holywood gimmicks, predictable cuts and music, this is a nearly flawless film. Dead-on dramatically, and excellently scripted and based on an eloquent true-story by Suzana Keisen, this movie offers a glimpse of one intensely personal experience of truth. Without the quotation marks, dark cynicism, or pretensions that revelation so frequently entails.",9,169,196,27 January 2000
