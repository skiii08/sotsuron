The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Review From A Male Perspective
","I rated this movie as a seven and feel that it is watchable for most men. The movie starts off very slowly, with lame jokes and a less than romantic wedding scene, but what else can you expect from a film that has a largely teenaged fan base? It does manage to pick up once the story shifts locations and has a decent amount of drama that will at least keep most men awake to follow the storyline. More importantly, the story ends with a great buildup to the final movie.For more on why I rated this a 7, you can see and hear my comments (which include spoilers) in the link below: http://www.spreecast.com/events/easymactwilight",7,2,8,22 November 2011
Get Him to the Greek," Don't even rent this movie, wait for it on TNT
","This movie has a handful of funny parts and that's it. Nowhere near as good as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and doesn't make any genuine efforts to tie in the two movies at all. Diddy cannot act. Jonah Hill isn't funny at all in this film and Russell Brand is probably better served as a supporting actor because his comedic routine gets old very fast. The best role comes from Rose Byrne who unfortunately only spends about 15 minutes on screen, the interactions between her and Brand's character as the highlight of the movie and it probably would've been 10x more entertaining had they just focused the film strictly on the relationship of those two odd characters.If you enjoy overacting and simple punchlines, this movie will be right up your alley, otherwise do yourself a favor and save ten bucks.",3,13,27,21 June 2010
