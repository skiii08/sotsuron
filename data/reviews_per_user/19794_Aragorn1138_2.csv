Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars set the standard for movies
","Back in 1977, Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope was released.  It changed the way we looked at movies forever.  Over the next six years two more movies were released and both were also very popular.  For sixteen years many other movies tried to capture the magic, but couldn't.  Peoples attitudes also changed over this time.  Episode I was great, but people were expecting far too much from it.  IT IS JUST A MOVIE!!!  Many people also don't like movies that contain graphic violence, swearing etc.  George Lucas could not possibly have made a new Star Wars that everyone would be happy with.  He did bring everyone back to a galaxy far, far away and did it well.  He showed us the beauty of Naboo, the barren landscapes of Tatooine and the gleaming skyscrapers of Coruscant. I think he did a great job, as he brought some magic into people's lives, even maybe for just a few moments.  Isn't that what movies are for, after all....",10,0,0,29 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's beyond words...
","Star Wars.  Well, as you can probably tell from my name, I'm a big fan. But I think it's impossible to capture the essence of this movie or my feelings for it in a review.  Here goes.Star Wars was released in 1977.  At that time, sci-fi movies were usually low-budget, bad effects jobs.  Star Wars was reasonably low-budget, but thats as far as the similarities went.  But then again, Star Wars isn't really sci-fi at all.  Star Wars is a genre of it's own.  It is set a long time ago, but also in a galaxy far, far away.  Many of the situations and characters are based on myths and legends, unlike normal sci-fi works. How many people can empathise with Luke, looking over the twin-sunned horizon, looking for something more in life?The Music.  What can I say?  John Williams has to be THE greatest film music composer of all time.  I'll never forget the Star Wars main theme, or any more of the Star Wars pieces.  Music played a huge factor in Star Wars-I don't think any fan can think of Darth Vader without thinking of the booming tones of Imperial March.The special effects are amazing.  Even though some of todays computer generated effects are better, can anyone who saw Star Wars in 1977 really say they weren't amazed by the explosions, the ships, and the aliens?Star Wars-thats as good as I can describe it-if you haven't seen it, get down to your video shop right now and rent it.  If you have, see it again. Relive the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and all the other characters!  This is the best movie of all time!!!",10,0,0,5 January 2000
