The Monuments Men," This is just not a very good movie.
","The subject matter is very interesting. The war times are always a fertile ground to tell a story. However this particular film is weak in every dimension. The story is not told well, the action doesn't flow at all. It is all choppy and disjointed. One part of the story doesn't connect with the other. The Matt Damon part and in particular the tentative love story has little to do with the rest of the film. The various events do not connect with one another. The heroism of the characters is artificial and their lines downright corny and cheesy. The US guys are just boy scout heroes with few vices. They pontificate and lecture. Then there is the failed attempt at humor. Humor in this movie has one big problem. It is not funny. All supposedly funny interludes fall flat. Wow, enough. You can do well by skipping this movie. Not worth spending the eleven dollars and two hours.",4,1,4,16 February 2014
