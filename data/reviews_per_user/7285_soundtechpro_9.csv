First Man," Boring, slow and lackluster
","I will preface my review by saying I love Drama and intense in-depth movies that most people find boring. I was looking forward to this movie because it sounded promising, however this is one of the most boring, tedious, selt-indulgent, painfully slow movies I have ever watched. It literally took discipline to sit and watch the movie in its entirety. It doesn't give any true insight into Neil Armstrong life or NASA space program or moon landing. Just lots of intense silent dramatic stares onscreen. Don't waste your time and pass on this movie. You are missing nothing.",3,5,8,27 January 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Another Great Installment
","This movie us another great installment in The Hunger Games Series. It continues the story very effectively. While it is not as action packed as the first two, it is riveting nonetheless. It deals with much of the emotional baggage and PTSD suffered by Katniss. I have no idea what movie the person who gave it a 1 was watching. But don't believe his/her review. I generally do not watch movies that are geared more towards teens through 20 year old but this is great books and the movies are vry tiveting. It is well worth taking a weekend and bindge watching all movies in one day.",8,0,1,12 March 2017
Star Trek," A Huge Let Down for Trekkies - If only...........
","First let me say that I have been a lifelong Star Trek fan.That being said I was very disappointed with this movie. I had high expectations with JJ Abrams on board. I fully expected this movie to be true to the Star Trek universe instead of the Action/Sci-Fi movie concept. Star Trek has always been first and foremost a show about relationships and moral/social issues. Action is great but only when it is secondary to the characters we love so much and the story line. I know that I was expecting the movie to not only show how the main character met but how those relationships developed. Basically what we got was a quick introduction to the characters and an action movie with a confusing story line that left many unresolved issues that was not in line with the original series events. While Star Trek has always made use of the time travel concept it appeared it was only used in this movie as a way to work Leonard Nimoy into the movie. The 'Nero' story was so weak and the movie was not really at all about the development of the characters we have all loved for so many years. As for the 'Nero' story, just killing Nero would not have reversed the time line. We know in the original series that Amanda Grayson (Spock's mom) is alive and that the planet Vulcan was never destroyed completely with only a few Vulcans left to colonize another planet. In the original series, the reference was that Vulcans were a waring people who almost destroyed themselves before they gained control of their emotions. I am still trying to figure this confusing story line out. I suppose that some will say the movie was a success because it was action packed, exciting and appealed to a non-trekkie younger audience. However, I personally feel it was a failure. I admit that the casting was good. However, good casting cannot overcome a bad storyline. My advice, If you are a true Trekkie, wait for the DVD. If you just like action/sci-fi then you will love it. But there was nothing special about this movie. It left me very hollow and thinking about 'what might have been' had they made a movie with the characters being central instead of the action/fight scenes. I believe this movie was written and marketed to be new, hip and appeal to teenagers. It is definitely not faithful to the Star Trek genre.",8,90,147,8 May 2009
Passengers," Great Movie! Don't Understand Negative Reviews
","I will preface this review by stating I'm going to speak in generalities because I don't want to spoil it by giving details.This is a great movie it has the right mix of sci-fi, mystery, romance, a really shocking plot twist with a great ending. I don't understand why people have called this movie horrible because it's really an awesome movie. The first 2/3 of the movie spends he necessary time building the plot and drawing you in as a viewer. But the last 1/3 of the movie feels rushed. I really would have rather had a large beer movie and wish they had spent more time on resolving the issue. If they had done Leo's I could've given this movie a 10. I love movies that are based around character development and this one does a great job. I found this movie totally entertaining and it took me through a full range of almost every emotions and made me feel what 'The Passengers' did. Don't pay any attention to the PAC police he thought this movie was just horrible and scandalous because it's not it's a great movie for people of all ages.",8,2,3,28 October 2018
The Revenant," CGI Fest but Movie Lacks Substance
","Skip 'The Revenant' and watch 'Man In The Wilderness' (1971) instead. The Revenant is a remake of 'Man In The Wilderness' which is much more factual to the true story. Yes f you love CGI then you will love 'The Revenant'. Personally I do not like CGI because CGI does not look realistic and indeed looks animated. If you are seeking a movie true to facts, but may not be as visually stimulating then watch 'Man In The Wilderness'. It's pretty much that simple. Hollywood has lost their imagination so instead of coming up with new movie ideas, they just continue to remake old movies again and again and focusing on CGI. I will take substance and movies 'shot on sight' over CGI any day.",4,2,5,21 October 2018
Ender's Game," Goid Mobie.....Dont understand bad reviews
","First, I will state I have not read tge book and from Experience I know that books are generally much better than the movie. Definitely that goes for The Hunger Games the books were so much better. This is not normally the top of movie I would watch but Ender's Game is worthy of watching more than one time it is a good movie with a good message. I do think the movie would have been better had it been longer and more developed but considering people don't have the patience to sit that long it's definitely an underrated movie. Watch and enjoy. It took me two viewings to really get what was going on since I had not read the book.",8,0,1,8 February 2019
The Hurricane," Movie is a Work of Fiction not Fact
","I suppose if you watch this movie and base it on acting alone you will love it. However, if you are actually interested in the truth, this is not a movie to be watched or believe. There are so many factual errors it would take a we website to list them all and I can recommend one. http://www.graphicwitness.com/carter/#moviegraphics - Click on this and read the truth. Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter was found guilty twice and all the facts point to his guilt. This movie turns him into a hero and he has made a lot of money of 'his true life story' (lol). I call it a thorough pack of lies. Hollywood does use poetic license to tell stories as it does in most cases when an movie is based on a real even or life but this is shameful. It is not remotely based on any facts and takes a man who was a twice convicted double murdered and makes him a role model. One thing in the movie I have issues with is the fat pig racist cop. Even Hollywood admitted there was no person like this. It was made up to enhance the movie. Do some research of your own. It was a well- made fiction movie but there was nothing factual about this movie which is why I rated it a 1 and only gave it that because you can't give a 0. I always loved movies with Denzel Washington but I will think twice before I watch him in another. Hollywood star or not. One should choose to research a story being presented as fact because you lose credibility. Prior to this movie Denzel always played roles that were either truly guilty or very factually based and I applauded him for that. But the Hurricane is nothing but a lot of hot air and no fact.",1,5,9,16 August 2012
Dark Shadows," Great Movie..Do not listen to bad reviews
","I gave no idea why everyone goves this movie mediocre reviews. If you were a fan of Dark Shadows soap opera you will love this movie. It has good storyline, humor ans the Dark Shadows scary moments. Tim Burton And Johnny Depp at their brst. The cinematography of this film captures the look and feel of the late 60. The muted color tones transports you back to that time period.I love when Karen Carpenter is on the TV singing 'Top of the World'. Barnabas Collins goes up to the TV and says, 'What sorcery is this? (rips out a cord from the TV) Reveal yourself, tiny songstress!'",9,0,0,15 May 2020
13 Hours," Truthful Acvount Told by the Soldiers in Benghazi, not a dry eye in theatre
","13 Hours is the unadultered truth about what happened at Benghazi. although a great film by Michael Bay it may it could have just as well been a documentary. And the lives that were lost due to the incompetence of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. This movie is not about politics but about the truth and how they tried so hard to go on to save ambassador Stevens and the other 3 at the embassy. Obama and Secretary Clinton did nothing while the bottle when on for 13 hours straight. Had Hillary Clinton the Secretary of State taken action our 4 Americans would be alive. When he movie was over, there wasn't a dry eye in the theatre. You could hear people crying. There was no cheering only silence as the reality of what truly happened and how it could have been prevented begin with sunk in. The audience was truly moved and I hope that when people watch this they don't see a Hollywood blockbuster but they see the truth and realize that Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and Obama let down are people at the Embassy. This is the same Hillary Clinton that had another filmmaker put in jail. Ambassador Stevens had requested security over 600 times from Hillary Clinton's state department and was turned down. And everyone keep saying that there wasn't a stand down order but I choose to believe the soldiers on the ground because they have no reason to lie our soldiers are honest, trustworthy and honorable. Our soldiers are willing to give their lives so that others may live. They do not have a political agenda. Also the families of the victims so people need to stop buying Hillary Clinton's BS. Hillary is such a liar and this movie not only made me extremely sad but it infuriated me that our country abandoned our people to be murdered at the hands of terrorist. They need the truth from the moment it happen and yet they came out with a fake narrative about it being caused by a video in order to win the next election. Whatever happened to the days when our nation came first before politics. My family has served in the military and every war since the Revolutionary war with many serving 20-40 years. To claim that the military vets are lying is unbelievable hypocrisy. This is a must see movie for everyone who is an American.",8,15,32,18 January 2016
