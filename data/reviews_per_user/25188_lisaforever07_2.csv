Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," applause for Borat
","I went to see this movie last weekend. I was skeptical at first, because of all the good reviews and not too thrilled by the trailer. I was wrong, so wrong. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen, I laughed the whole time and so was everyone in the movie theater! Maybe the scene where he's naked was a bit revolting, but the rest of the movie was great! Some other scenes were a bit over the line but since it was all staged and he's just an actor in the end it didn't really matter!I recommend everyone I know to see it, it's worth it and they won't regret it! Congratulations Sacha, well done!",7,2,8,20 November 2006
The Fountain," i don't get it
","I went to see this movie last week with some friends. At the end I was like 'what? that's it?'. I like Hugh and Rachel..all the movies I've seen them in, but this one is bad! This movie is a waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know, but if you don't trust me go see it, you will waste almost two hours of your life. I guess that the love story sells a movie like this, but the end is stupid and meaningless. I don't like to watch movie that make me think too much. I believe that when you go to the theater you need some distraction and feel happy when you get out, life is already bad itself, you don't need a movie to depress you more.",2,3,7,11 December 2006
