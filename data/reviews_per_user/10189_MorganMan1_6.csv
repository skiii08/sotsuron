Scarface," Tony is getting old, but he 'Stillee GOTTs IT Mann!!
","I never will forget the first time I watched Scarface, I was about 30, climbing the corporate ladder and finally meet an executive I could relate to; Tony Montana. He gave those of us from that era a motto to pattern our business life from 'The world is yours' and 'Alah I got Mann is mye worde and my balls'. A very simple vision statement if you were into that sort of thing. What is your vision? Own the world. How you going to do it? With mye worde mann an mye balls an mye blow an mye tiggerr.. What an amazing movie. I watch it at least once a year and I am always amazed at how timeless it is. Do you realize he took more bullets in that one movie than John Wayne did in his entire career? Don't you know he snorted and swallowed more cocaine in that movie than Paris Hilton has in her entire life? If you start to get down and disgusted with life 'just pop in your 20th anniversary addition of that remarkable move. It will be a lot less expensive, more enjoyable and much more useful than a trip to the shrink or a seminar and no one really knows why??",10,0,2,6 August 2006
Walk the Line," Walk the Line, Not a Ray,, but...
","'Walk the Line', the movie about Johnny Cash. It was no 'Ray', but it was still worth the cost of the tickets and a pleasing movie on every level. I found it to have an energy that I was not expecting and the acting was much better than I expected. The singing was very good also. I think this movie will please most that want a somewhat historical account of the like of Johnny Cash. Joaquin was great, almost as good as he was in U Turn playing TNT. I was very surprised by his performance and honestly did not expect to buy into him as Johnny Cash; but I did. The only short coming he had as Johnny Cash is he can carry a tune and as all of us Johnny Cash fans know he had a very rich voice but never could carry a tune.",8,0,1,6 August 2006
Capote," To Real to Really Enjoy
","The acting is this movie is superb, the best, outstanding and the only reason I give it a vote of 7. I found the movie to real to really allow me to enjoy the movie. Don't get me wrong; if you want to see someone come off as the 'real' Truman Capote, or you want some one to recreate him (why would any one want that), then this is the movie for you. Hoffman was just as obnoxious on the screen as Truman Capote was when he used to make the talk show circuit. Hoffman did a wonderful job of portraying an alcoholic, self absorbed, homosexual, literary genius. The story was weak in my opinion. I could never decide if it was a glorified rehash of 'In Cold Blood', or if it was a true insight into the life, works and accomplishments of Truman Capote. In the end it accomplished neither for me.",7,0,1,5 August 2006
World Trade Center," A thoughtless 'screenplay'
","I know some people are going to say I'm a non patriotic person for not liking the World Trade Center movie, but this movie was just boring. The previews lead you to think it is going to be an epic movie that deals with the World Trade Towers event. Instead it is just a simple screenplay devised to play on the public's emotions and sell bottled water. Oliver Stone and Nichols Cage should donate at least half of the mega money they will make from this thoughtless picture back to the efforts to clean up the site. The bulk of this simple 'cave in' movie was all shot on one set and filled in with newsreel footage. The acting involved cameos appearances by many different actors and the rest was just dialog between two actors talking about their family members. I do respect the event but I think a little thought should be put into a major movie production about such a serious subject.",1,4,10,16 September 2006
The Departed," This remake is SUPERB!
","Another remake, but a good one. The 'Departed' is a remake of the Asian produced movie 'Infernal Affairs'.I enjoyed watching this movie and never regretted going to see it for one second. It was enjoyable and very well done. Sure you could find faults and 'untied ends' left loose and never explained but over all it was one of the very best 'gangster' type movies I have ever seen! Jack Nicholson had his part down almost perfect and Mark Walberg was great as an edgy, cranky cop on the good. But this movie did one thing very few movies can ever claim; it showcased and proved the actor of the decade, Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, I would not have ever thought I would make this claim but He has earned it.If you like realistic violence, hard-hitting drama and edge of your seat suspense then this movie is for you. If you like great acting, top notch direction and some of the best story telling in cinema; please see this one. It is the best movie I have seen this year and I have seen a lot of movies. As a rule, I do not like remakes but this one is Superb!",10,6,11,9 October 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The funniest commercial I have ever seen!!
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is one of the longest and funniest commercials I have ever seen. They ought to play it during next years 'Super Bowl' I am sure it would win the best commercial vote. This movie is the ultimate commercial venture and a prime example of the new Hollywood Machine. That machine takes previously made proved movies, repackages them and fills them with ads. It then hypes them and sells them back to the gullible public as a grand new event that you must pay $12 to see on opening day! Don't you agree? If not, let me ask you a question, have you ever seen Will Ferrell running down the road in his underwear before? It was funny the first time, the second time, this three times and it will be funny the next time. The only improvement that they can make will be to catch a close up of the 'BVD' label on his underwear; of course he will have to wear them inside out next time. Well, he could wear them inside out and on his head. Hasn't that already been done and proved effective? A perfect addition to the next movie commercial.In all fairness, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby has a couple of tired old, funny SNL sight gags and you don't have to think to watch it. It is actually best to be stoned when you watch it. We observed that this movie is perfect fare for mindless, pimple faced punks. Those 'up and comers' that have been raised on old SNL sight gags, do-do jokes and fast food. A perfect movie for millions of them to spend their parents money on. What a winning combination, the makers will laugh all the way to the bank, a learned behavior.",2,8,17,11 August 2006
