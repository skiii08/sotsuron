War Dogs," Sex, drugs, guns, violence - loved this film, am I the only one?!
","Am I the only person on IMDb message boards who actually liked War Dogs?I know I'm not the only critic in the UK who liked it, as the Radio Times and Daily Mail marked it up as 5 and 4 stars out of 5 respectively.Jonah Hill turns in a performance full of garrulous vim and vigour and Miles Teller, as the dubious conscience of the piece, perfectly holds the film together during Hill's brief sojourns from the screen and matches him when he returns.Director/co-writer Phillips keeps the sleazy narrative on course throughout and leavens the questions about ethics and being a good citizen for his 'heroes' with some of the best wise- cracking one-liners and some critically questioning scenes.",Null,0,1,26 August 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Solid and well made disaster movie
","2010 was not the best year to be British, given all the poor headlines associated with us/our footballers/our supermodels generated.BP's involvement in the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, fire and resultant catastrophic oil spill in April of that year was no doubt not our finest hour. Certainly not according to US news coverage who, rightly angered and asking the right questions, pointed their fingers too squarely at the B(ritish) part of the companies acronym.Peter Berg's account of the immediate disaster wisely avoids this and ends being an unexpectedly fair and even handed film.Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell turn up for the manly rescue duties and turn in very dependable, muscular turns in a solid film.",8,1,2,3 October 2016
Moana," Will the animated film become a victim of its own success?
","The quality of some of the animation in Moana is phenomenal. We already know animated/CGI film has come on in leaps and bounds ever since Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) but in Moana it looks so real.If this continues, will animation and live-action film become indistinguishable? We have a little while left until or if that happens so can enjoy the vibrant, amusing fantasies that studios such as Disney continue to produce with what seems such easy excellence.The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, was the only man big enough in real-life to portray a (apparently) huge demigod but he is bested by the relatively unknown Hawaiian singer Auli'i Cravalho in the title tole.",8,1,12,10 December 2016
The Revenant," Gritty, grizzled, gory, great
","The Oscar nominations for 2016 have just been announced and whilst there has been what is almost the expected controversy about the lack of diversity amongst the nominees, one thing has not been grumbled about is that this low-down and gritty western from the director of last year's big winner Birdman has come out on top with 12 nominations including, Best Picture and Director.It might win them again, if the otherwise dull but pretty Carol doesn't scoop them (unaccountably, this is the film of the year for almost all critics. Am I missing something? Did anything transpire in it?!).In terms of the depiction of suffering and hardship DiCaprio's fur trapper undergoes and Iñárritu's masterful handling of camera and pacing, this is as awesome as the unyielding American and Canadian landscapes it is set in.DiCaprio himself may win too, as he is up for Best Actor for his 'grey teeth and spittle' performance. 'I ain't afraid to die anymore. I done that already' he intones, perfectly matching his grizzled character, from greasy hair down to his crippled feet.Also nominated is Hardy as his murderous colleague. It's a wordier and stronger performance, showing his increasing confidence at quietly upstaging the bigger star.See the full review: http://ow.ly/X8YyZ",9,0,2,16 January 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A non-wizarding fan goes out on a limb...what cr*p!
","OK, so I can bit a grump where fantasy films are concerned. Not that I don't like them, I do. My ideal kind of cinema is one that lifts me up out of my cinema seat in the dull plane of existence I inhabit and, for 90-120 minutes, transports me to another time, place or world.But does it have to lob layer upon layer of encyclopaedic background cr*p at me? Am I supposed to do something with it? Why isn't this experience fun for me?I admit I'm in the minority, but I find these fantasy universe films tiring. 'Fantastic Beasts...' is exceptionally well made, the production design is astonishing and is very well acted by a game cast (Ezra Miller, take a bow), but make it easy for an old man!",Null,4,6,19 November 2016
La La Land," Fresh, funny, fizzy...but not the classic everyone is making out
","You would think, considering the almost hysterically positive reviews, that the new Citizen Kane had been released with La La Land!I very much liked this film, a toe-tapping, sun-drenched, thoroughly entertaining ode to the musicals of yesteryear with a modern twist in the inventive dance numbers and slyly adult song lyrics.Ryan Gosling and (particularly) Emma Stone are on ripe, breezy, fun form and clearly relish playing opposite each other.The photography and lighting are stunning, showing off the varied colour schemes throughout.I just felt a better, more subtle marriage of the light musical and heavy dramatic moments was needed to meld all the wonderful elements together.",8,1,4,14 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," An extra 45 minutes whacked on?!
","Disney's live action remake of Cinderella set the box office tills on fire in 2015, so it was inevitable they would mine deeper into their archive of former glories for another hit.This mostly shot for shot remake of 1991's Best Picture Oscar nominated classic is less wooden and more lovingly handled, although with 45 mins of extra running time, the padding is sometimes painfully obvious.Emma Watson proves to be a charming Belle, far more accomplished in this non-Harry Potter outing than her previous ones (and is not hampered by a death knell American accent, cf The Bling Ring) and is matched by a hugely enjoyable Luke Evans as her preening suitor Gaston.",8,1,5,27 March 2017
Finding Dory," I Found Dory...but it wasn't 'anyfin' special
","If 20th Century Fox's Ice Age: Collision Course valiantly attempted to keep up with the series by throwing as many ideas into the mix, you would think an animated studio steeped in success as Pixar is would be more than capable of stepping up to the plate and besting themselves with a sequel.I'd say not after seeing Finding Dory, which is essentially the script of Finding Nemo (2003) re-hashed for a generation who either missed that film the first time around or the passage of time has led them to forget it.Some smart new characters make their debut here but the few-and-far-between ingenuity that is usually the hallmark of Pixar is overdone in a film as barren as the Dead Sea.",4,21,44,29 July 2016
Arrival," I'm no fan of sci-fi, but absolutely loved this
","I often struggle with sci-fi films.I love esoteric, 'out there' productions like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Under the Skin (2014) but get bored rigid by anything 'Star Warsy'.Arrival is definitely one of the former films, a sublimely cerebral, questioning piece about language, how we communicate and why talking and writing to each other is so important.In this heavily digital age, Arrival posits that, simplistic a solution it may seem, the spoken and written word are more powerful than guns, nukes and Presidents. Given the recent US Presidential election and the waves of worries and concerns that have rippled out across the digi-sphere, the film has an important message within its stunning visuals and superlative acting from Amy Adams.",Null,1,6,11 November 2016
Creed II," Boxing sequel comes out with fists up...and keeps them there.
","Hindsight is always 20/20 - at least according to Billy Wilder, who knew a thing or two about directing great movies.Perhaps the producers of Creed II (also producers of the original Rocky series, from which this new boxing film series has been sired) had that rapier-sharp insight when approaching how to make a sequel to the 2015 'son of Carl Weathers' blockbuster.Where the original Rocky sequel was degraded with syrupy gabble about settling down, buying a house and making babies, the first Creed sequel has bypassed that mucus for a better scripted, sharper return to the ring.Stunning performances all round, especially Stallone and Jordan but most impeccably (and surprisingly) from a near-sociopathically deranged Lundgen who returns as the Russian 'breaker' Ivan Drago.",9,0,1,8 December 2018
Life," Not much horror, but good, creepy atmosphere
","Life won't win many awards for scares, but it is certainly an unnerving and creepy film at times.Taut and consistently busy, in a talky, conversational manner, the only real fault with it that I had is the general lack of 'oomph' in the proceedings.Everything ticks along in a very neat and ordered manner, as the crew (a hard-working cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds) logically work through various too-organised- to-be-credible solutions to rid themselves of a reanimated martian organism.Too neat, too ordered, but all handled very professionally and hats off to director Daniel Esposito for delivering a smashing surprise ending.",7,2,7,27 March 2017
Sully," Are disaster movie scripts becoming less of a calamity?
","I still hanker after those halcyon days of the 1970's tragi-pic after being mesmerised at the capsizing dining salon sequence in The Poseidon Adventure as an inquisitive 12 year old.How that effect was achieved became a consuming desire and kick-started my interest in cinema.I didn't care a jot about the hackneyed dialogue, characterisation or preposterous scenario. But that type of blockbuster disaster drama is on the wane. In an age of openness and transparency, fact-based calamity cinema is all the rage, with Sully following Deepwater Horizon by sticking closely to the events that happened during and after tragedy.Tom Hanks, cinematic short-hand of the everyman character, was the right choice to play Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who breached accepted aviation protocol by ditching his stricken airline in the Hudson River. He is ably, amusingly supported by Aaron Eckhart.",7,0,0,17 December 2016
