It," When childhood fears grow up
",It is a movie that's scary in another way. It's not plain scares that won't let you sleep at night; it's more a reminder of growing fear. The movie shows a line of irrational fears children have - and it leads you to a conclusion what happens when you don't overcome your fear yourself. When I was sitting in the movie I was expecting a lot of scars but found myself wondering about my own irrational childhood fears and that some of them grew with me. It's a very deep movie that shows the power of fear.,10,2,3,3 October 2017
