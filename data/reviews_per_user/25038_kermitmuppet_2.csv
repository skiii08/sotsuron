3:10 to Yuma," garbage!
","The best way for me to describe this shocking film is to run through the plot. Gd cowboy catches bad cowboy killing someone.Bad cowboy lets him go free and report him to sheriff.Bad cowboy then goes into the closest town and stands in pub.Surprise surprise, sheriff walks in pub.Good cowboy points out bad cowboy to sheriff and says he will assist in handing him in in return for money.Bad cowboy LOVES gd cowboy for doing this and has dinner at his home.He then saves gd cowboys life, and shares stories while on his way to be hung.Best bit - Bad cowboy helps gd cowboy by running exactually where he wants while being persues by his own men.IM SAVING THE BEST UNTIL LAST - Bad cowboys men find him and point gun at gd cowboy.Bad cowboy kills his own men, but fails to save gd cowboy , whos shot during the battle.Then, as if the story wasn't funny enough, jumps on the jail train which is taking him to be hung!Full of strange loyalties between people, and appalling dialogue, this film is a total waste of the actors involved. But its hilarious, just i don't think it was supposed to be a comedy.1 out of 10.",1,6,10,15 July 2008
There Will Be Blood," What film was you watching? This was terrible!
","I had to open an account after watching this. Dis-jointed mish-mash, unlikeable characters, poor dialogue, un-exciting. Daniel day lewis will be the new gurning champion in the future on this performance.What did they say to him? Just be the same as you was in gangs of new york,and that will be great mate? I don't think it requires an intelligent person to see its brilliance as suggested by some reviews, but a sensible person to see what a mess it is. The most over-rated film on here along with 3.10 to yuma.I can appreciate a film that requires some effort to watch, in fact that whats i like, but this was an effort for all the wrong reasons.Without a doubt one of the worse films I've ever watched and thank-fully also one that i would of forgotten about by around tomorrow morning. AWFUL.",1,8,18,14 July 2008
