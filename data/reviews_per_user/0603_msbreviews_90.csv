Ford v Ferrari," Rating: A+
","I never expected a sports film, let alone one based on a true story, to impress me so damn much. James Mangold offers one of the best, if not the best sports movie ever. With award-worthy performances from both Christian Bale and Matt Damon, Ford v Ferrari (aka Le Mans '66) has characters so exceptionally-written and so emotionally compelling that I felt like crying by the end of the film. The races are riveting and entertaining, but it's the beautiful screenplay that gets me. Definitely, one of the movies of the year!",10,2,5,30 December 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Rating: A+
","Before I actually start reviewing Blade Runner 2049, I need to briefly share my thoughts on the first film and also to answer a question that a lot of people have been asking me: 'do I need to watch the original to enjoy and understand the sequel'? Important fact: I re- watched Blade Runner: Final Cut (1997) and a few hours later, I was standing in an IMAX theater waiting for 2049 to start, so I'm pretty sure that I was the best-prepared person in that theater to watch Villeneuve's movie.After a lot of thinking and analysis, I concluded that I love Blade Runner. The cultural influence that it had on sci-fi and how it changed filmmaking, makes it a masterpiece, even though it has some flaws. From the incredible, profound and intriguing story to one of the brainiest unconfirmed mysteries of cinema, it's one of Ridley Scott's greatest films. It's one of those rare movies that gets better and better with time (extremely underrated when it came out), but it's still mind-blowing how well a film stands 35 years after its release.I would give it an A, due to some issues that I can't overlook. The romance between Deckard and Rachael (Sean Young) feels very forced and the pacing isn't well-balanced. However, the amazing story, the well-developed characters and the beautiful cinematography, plus an excellent performance by Harrison Ford and an exquisite directing work by Ridley Scott, elevate Blade Runner and make it one of the most influent sci-fi movies of all-time.So, my answer to the pertinent question at the beginning of this review is ... Watch the original! I'm not advising you to watch it because you'll not understand the sequel if you don't, but due to its importance and how it molds 2049 as one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen.I don't think this movie is for everyone though. I don't think an occasional film-goer will understand how mind-blowing Villeneuve's movie is or how influential it will become. Some people will feel extremely bored during the first half of the film, some might even leave. Others might enjoy the second half of the movie and end up being satisfied with it. People like me, who LOVE movies and LOVE the art of filmmaking, will leave the theater jaw-dropped and tearily happy for having experienced such a stunning masterpiece!Villeneuve requested film critics to not spoil any plot point that could ruin the movie. I'm overjoyed to honor that request because this is a film that you NEED to watch at the best quality theater, with the best looking screen and with the best sound speakers. Roger Deakins' cinematography is beautifully perfect. It's just perfect. There's not a better word to describe such flawless and stunning visuals. If he doesn't get every single award for this category, I'll give up on caring about Oscars or Golden Globes. Congratulations on being such an inspiration and on elevating every single movie you're in, Deakins.Denis Villeneuve reinforces his position as my favorite director working nowadays and as one of the best directors of all-time. His unbelievable imagination and wonderful way of grasping every single moment and turning it into so much more than it actually is, either by adding asphyxiating suspense or overwhelming dialogue, are just two of many phenomenal skills that he possesses.Michael Green and Hampton Fancher's writing is worthy of all attention and some more from the audience. Every single word matters! Every line of dialogue is filled with so much depth and meaning, which setups so many surprises that Villeneuve brilliantly executes with the help of a memorable soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Every single technical aspect of Blade Runner 2049 is an epic example of how to produce a film. I have no words to describe how PERFECT the work behind the screen is ...Ryan Gosling deserves every type of praise and so much more. If he got nominated for his La La Land's performance, he's definitely going to win everything this year. I mean, he has to! His characters' conflicting memory and heartfelt story are extremely well displayed by Gosling in the first half of the movie, the half that most people will have a grudge with due to its pacing, but not me. The deliberately slow rhythm is so magnificently compensated in the last half that I don't even consider it a minor issue. In addition to his great performance, Gosling also has the best dialogue scene in the entire film, which I can't wait to watch all over again hundreds of times.Harrison Ford has his best performance in years and he also might get some nominations. Once again, his characters' past is as mysterious as it was in 1982 and the surprises are jaw- dropping. Robin Wright (Lieutenant Joshi) and Ana de Armas (Joi) also achieve great performances, as Jared Leto (Niander Wallace) briefly shines in his few scenes.Finally, the story is what gives this movie the feel of epicness. It truly justifies the long runtime (even if I agree that it could have been 10-15min shorter), but it lays those reasons on the audience, expecting us to wait ... and wait. Patience is more than a virtue in this film, it's a necessity. These are the only pieces of advice I'm giving to people: watch the first movie and WAIT for the second one to blow you away. That's as far as I'm going with the plot, I want you to enjoy and have the same spectacular experience that I had.Undoubtedly, Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite film of 2017 and it's going to be extremely difficult for any other to surpass it, as Denis Villeneuve's flawless masterpiece surpassed Ridley Scott's original. Denis' technically mind-blowing directing, Roger Deakins' jaw-dropping cinematography, Hans Zimmer's memorable score, Michael Green and Hampton Fancher's incredibly tricky and meaningful screenplay ... All of that, plus heartfelt and compelling performances from Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, elevate this movie and make it an EPIC MASTERPIECE.I'm filled with tears of wonder and joy ... Go see it so you can be too.",10,2,15,6 October 2017
First Man," Rating: B+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I always struggle to analyze films based on real-life events, especially in this case. Man landing on the Moon is not just a story that most people know, it's something that EVERYONE knows, which can be an instant flaw to a movie. If everyone knows the story, then predictability is a guaranteed factor, and any scene involving tension or suspense loses its impact since everyone knows how it ends. I mean, this is still a spoiler-free review, but ... Is it really?!So, Damien Chazelle didn't have an easy job. How can you convey that feeling of concern for the character if the audience already knows that he/she is going to be okay? How can you make your viewers stay captivated for more than two hours when the story has its beginning, middle and ending pretty well-defined in their minds? How can you make a film about one of the most important and meaningful moments in humankind's history without it being a total letdown?Well, thanks to the incredible dedication of Chazelle and the thoughtful screenplay by Josh Singer, First Man is a success and most likely the best movie in history to depict the Moon landing and everything that it required to achieve it. The biggest surprise of this experience (because it is, indeed, a cinematic experience) is that I didn't feel bored, even though I do think the film is too long. Singer's character scripts are extremely well-written, giving each and everyone one of them a defining personality.Every secondary character is important, and that is one of the reasons I truly enjoyed First Man. It offered me a new perspective on how the Moon landing was planned and what did it need to go through. A lot of people only associate the Moon landing to Neil Armstrong, and that's it. This movie goes through Gemini, the project that allowed Apollo to start, every astronaut involved that unfortunately died just trying to perform some tests ... It is an in-depth look at not only Armstrong's life but everyone around him.However, he is, in fact, the star of the show. Being able to learn more about his tragic past (which I didn't know before the film), how he had to deal with so many deaths, how he had to tell his kids that he might not ever return, his marriage, his bravery and calm under stressful situations... I know it's a movie, but knowing that Ryan Gosling and the crew talked with the real Neil about him and everything else, it really feels like First Man depicts what truly happened, even if it overdramatizes here and there.The cast is unbelievably amazing. Jason Clarke is great as Ed White, one of Neil's closest friends. Claire Foy is absolutely astonishing as Neil's wife, Janet, and she might be looking at an Oscar nomination. However, the one that carries this entire thing and who is undoubtedly getting a nomination is Ryan Gosling. Gosh, this guy really knows how to pick his films. Wonderful performance, filled with emotional moments and remarkably tense dialogues which he perfectly nailed. It's not exactly his career-best performance but, so far, it's one of the year's best.Technically, it couldn't reach my expectations better. Naturally, I expected a gorgeous-looking movie with Damien Chazelle proving that he knows his craft and that's what I got. The filmmaking in display is indisputably spectacular. From the brilliant decision to film the claustrophobic interior of the rockets to the small detail in the camera movement resembling the difficulty in focusing the lenses back in the day (that grainy resolution), almost everything is seamless. An excellent editing, an artistic cinematography by the well-known Linus Sandgren and an epic score by Justin Hurwitz, elevate the film in a significant way.It isn't a flawless one, and it's majorly due to its runtime. Almost every issue that I have is partially related to the movie's length because if it was a bit shorter, then these issues would feel like nitpicks. The shaky-cam used to provide a realistic feeling inside the spaceflight's modules gets excessive and exhausting. The story lacks a quicker pace in the second act since there are gaps where nothing happens. Finally, even though everyone knows how things finish, the ending feels a bit abrupt. I think some scenes weren't that necessary and the time that they could have used in its conclusion, they didn't.All in all, First Man is yet another Damien Chazelle's success. Technically astounding, this film offers a new perspective on how the Moon landing was performed and mainly what did it demand to get there. Lives were lost, and these tragic moments of his life shaped Neil Armstrong's personality. Ryan Gosling incorporates Neil in an emotionally brilliant way, saving him a likely Oscar nomination. Claire Foy also delivers an award-winning performance. It isn't a perfect movie primarily due to its excessive length which raises some of its other issues. Nevertheless, that epic Justin Hurwitz's score during the Apollo 11 launch and the astonishing Linus Sandgren's cinematography in the Moon are going to be kept in my memory forever.",8,0,1,19 October 2018
Mission: Impossible III," Rating: B+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I am resuming my reviews of the Mission: Impossible franchise, anticipating the release of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, which comes out a few days from now. My thoughts on Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II are already written, and you can click on the titles to read my reviews for those movies. After a massive decline in quality from M:I-1 to M:I-2, this third installment picks the saga back up!There are a lot of aspects improved based on the previous films. First of all, the action. This might be THE movie where the stunt work really achieved jaw-dropping levels. From Cruise's epic runs throughout the streets of Shangai (just a single take!) to the astonishingly filmed money shots, J.J. Abrams makes an impressive debut since this was his first feature film. He knows how to incorporate the actors with the visual effects and this time everything looks incredibly realistic and riveting. This movie has the best action of the first three films, by far.Second of all, the characters. J.J. Abrams brings back the original Ethan Hunt, the one that is not a copycat of James Bond (looking at you M:I-2). Everything about this character's arc makes sense, and his relationship with Julia provides some nail-biting suspenseful moments in the third act, where Michelle Monaghan also shines. Tom Cruise obviously continues to be the star of the franchise, but finally, there is a decent villain ...Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers an exceptional performance as the bad guy. That's just what he is: a bad guy. His character does not get any development, but Hoffman picks up his depthless script and surprisingly makes it work. He is the best villain in the franchise so far, and he is connected to the most suspenseful scene in the movie. Ving Rhames returns as Luther, as well as the character's humorous personality. With so much action and tense moments, it is a breath of relief to be able to smile or even laugh with Rhames' lines.Third and final, the pacing. The second film is an ultimate bore. This one, I even understand people who say that it has too much action and it all comes too fast ... Because it does. The frenetic pacing from the first movie is back, and it goes up a gear or two. There is not a single moment to rest between scenes, and that might be an issue for some, but for me, I needed it after the tedious M:I-2. Dull moments are nonexistent, and the excitement is always at high levels. That is what I call entertainment!Nevertheless, it does has some flaws regarding the plot. Besides being very predictable, its structure bothers me a little. J.J. Abrams decides to begin the film with a scene that I don't really understand why he chose to put it there. I don't want to go into spoilers, but there are a couple of questionable decisions regarding the storyline that just don't quite make sense to me.In addition to this, the story itself is pretty generic. The villain is only amazing due to Hoffman's performance since the script gives zero development. The plot twists are evident by the end of the first act, so they lose their impact towards the end. However, the thing that kind of ruined a perfect ending (still a great ending though) is how they handle Michelle's character. I will just say that it becomes too nonsensical and extremely forced, and Julia is the reason behind it.Despite its flaws, Mission: Impossible III brings the saga back to life with the best action of the entire franchise, some fantastic additions to its cast and a super exciting and riveting pacing. Tom Cruise provides some epic stunts, Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best villain so far, and Ving Rhames continues to be awesome. However, the plot is very generic, predictable and its structure makes some supposedly suspenseful scenes lose its emotional impact. It's a hair below M:I-1 but miles and miles above the awful M:I-2, thanks to J.J. Abrams incredible directorial debut, which is filled with phenomenal camera work, jaw-dropping stunts and a remarkable use of visual effects.",8,0,0,31 July 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Rating: A
","This is an amazing claustrophobic thriller with a major part of the runtime spent in just one confined space. Starting with the pros, I have to congratulate the director Dan Trachtenberg because this was his first feature film and it was brilliant, full of tension and suspense.Then, the actors: all of them were great  John Goodman as Howard is perfect! You know that he did an awesome job when you spend the whole movie unable to figure out if he's really insane or not. In one scene, he may seem crazy, but in the next one he's completely normal and that makes us and our hero, Jessica, with no idea of what's true or not. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also really great, probably her best performance so far and her character is definitely someone who you care for. Usually, in this type of movies, the hero is not really smart and does things that are nowhere near rational, but in this movie she is and she's ahead of Howard, most of the time.John Gallagher Jr. plays Emmett and he also gives a good performance. However, his character was not as compelling as the others and that's fine since this movie concerned more Howard and Jessica. Still, he was in the moment of the movie where my jaw just dropped of how intense that scene was. This movie gives small hints along the way (book in a shelf, someone's former profession ) and, if you connect all of them, the ending will not come as a surprise (only if you've seen Cloverfield, which was a 'prequel' to this film  I will talk about it at the end of the review and after my rating since it has a minor spoiler for 10 Cloverfield Lane).The ending felt rushed, it's really abrupt and it can leave you a little disappointed, at first. After thinking about all the hints given through the movie, the sounds that were heard and some dialogues, you connect everything and it doesn't feel that fast anymore, so it actually worked for me.————————-MINOR SPOILER WARNING————————-In Cloverfield, there was a giant monster destroying everything and, at the end of the movie, there's a flashback where, in the background, you can see a dark point falling from the sky (really easy to miss). That was a satellite (Howard's former profession involved working with satellites) and it, supposedly, woke up the Cloverfield monster.Knowing this, the end of 10 Cloverfield Lane will make more sense to you and, in some way, will smooth away the rushed ending.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,3,4,6 August 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Rating: A
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) suffers a car accident and wakes up in a bunker, discovering that she has been 'rescued' by Howard (John Goodman). He keeps her from leaving by emphasizing that the world is no longer habitable following an attack on the planet.This is the second movie of the Cloverfield franchise and Dan Trachtenberg's big film debut, produced by the great J.J. Abrams.I feel like Cloverfield is a very underrated film. A lot of people didn't even saw it and they still decided to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane. Truthfully, you can do that and your movie experience will not change at all. Even though it is, in fact, part of the franchise, I can only find one and one only connection to the first one. I will discuss this one detail after my rating since it has a major spoiler for Cloverfield and a minor spoiler for the one I am going to review now.I love claustrophobic horror thrillers! I love when the film instantly makes me feel at the edge of my seat, ten minutes after it starts. Dan Trachtenberg's big movie debut does that for the entire runtime. The screenplay is especially intriguing and mysterious, which captivates me from the very start.The mystery surrounding the state of the planet and Howard's mental condition is so well manipulated, raising the tension and the suspense levels extremely present. There is always something new, there is not one misplaced scene (as we know, J.J. Abrams does not waste one single shot) and everything has its purpose whether that is a line of dialogue, an action or even just a shot of a bookshelf.On such a confined space, it is unbelievable what a first-time film director can accomplish. He is able to provide new feelings and fresh scenes after one hour in the same freaking living room. I admire the camera angles and the extensive use of visual storytelling (once again, I bet JJ has his hands on this). The editing is seamless and the tone is very well-balanced. A practical setting elevates the realistic cinematography and the subtle score helps to increase the amount of suspense.As for the cast, they are the real stars of the movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has her career-best performance. She is incredibly compelling and everything she does, she does it flawlessly. Her character is a remarkably unconventional one, having in mind the cliche dumb characters in films like this. They always do what they are not supposed to and the audience is always ahead of them.Not Michelle. She is extremely smart and she is way ahead of the viewers! There are so many twists and turns due to her craftiness and intelligence during tense circumstances. Her backstory contradicts her behavior once she is in that bunker, which proves how much the character had to change in order to overcome her situation.However, John Goodman might be the absolute standout. He is just perfect. He needs to do something a lot of actors struggle with: insert doubt into the audience's minds. Howard is someone that I never know whether if he is crazy or if he is actually a rational guy. In a scene, he seems completely insane but right in the next one, he does or says something notably clever.It is impossible to understand if he is telling the truth or if something is up. Undoubtedly, this is due to Goodman's terrific performance and also due to the brilliant script that he and everyone else received. John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett) is the third person living in the bunker and even though he is fairly well-developed, he is only there to serve the story (he is even connected to the moment that changes the course of it). Good display from Gallagher.The first act is fantastic and the second act is phenomenal. The beginning of the third act is enthusiastic, but its ending is really abrupt. This is going to be a big issue for most people. If someone is not paying attention to everything that happens in the first two-thirds of the movie (every line of dialogue, every sound, every shot of an object), the ending is going to even make people hate this film because they will feel that it does not make sense.To those people, I recommend you to stop and think about it. Think about the movie and remember everything that happened until the beginning of the third act. If you do this with no anger clouding your judgment, then you will surely understand what Trachtenberg and his team wanted to deliver. Nevertheless, it comes very quickly and I feel that the way they executed it, is asking too much of me to let pass some line-crossing stuff, even though it is a science fiction film.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a fantastic 'sequel' (if I can call it that) to the movie that started it all. The entertainment levels are extremely high and I love the subtle connection to Cloverfield. Award-worthy performances from John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who carry a captivating and mysterious claustrophobic thriller. A wonderful debut of the director Dan Trachtenberg, who almost flawlessly tells a phenomenal story. The only stain in the picture is the abrupt ending and the way it is executed. The slow pacing helps to elevate the suspense and tension in a very unique film for its genre, while the technical aspects are to praise as well.
****************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
As I said at the end of my Cloverfield review, there is an extremely easy-to-miss black dot falling from the sky into the ocean, in the last shot of the movie.This is a satellite that for some reason fell from space. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, we learn through a couple of lines of dialogue and a shot of a bookshelf, that Howard's former job had to do with ... satellites. This is the only detail of this film that I can connect to the previous one.",9,0,0,27 February 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Rating: A
","True stories always have a special effect on me. If the director is able to capture the exact amount of reality needed for this kind of movies, then it becomes more than a film, but an experience that everyone should go through. Peter Berg does a brilliant job, I can't praise him enough.Everything from the character development scenes from the first act (which is surprisingly interesting and captivating) to the amazing visuals and controlled pacing, is near perfection. He gives time for us to care enough about everyone so that when the 'accident' starts, we truly care about the characters and we want them to survive.I love that there's no time for us to breathe or have a more relaxed scene from the moment the mud kicks in because that's how they felt when they were in the middle of the disaster. I love that there's never a 'Hollywood' scene, everything seems real and frightening. I love that the movie takes its time to explain how everything really went wrong, step-by-step, even if we aren't BP's scientists/engineers (there's a perfect analogy done with a Coke and a straw). I honestly love everything about Peter Berg's direction and I can't wait for Patriots Day (it seems that he's doing a 'true story trilogy' with Mark Wahlberg ... great!).Speaking of him, Mark Wahlberg is amazing in this film as well as Kurt Russell. Both of them have performances so heartfelt and REAL, they really give everything they have into this movie and that just makes it even more fantastic. John Malkovich is also present and I gotta say: he perfectly captures the arrogant, stupid, 'bad guy' from the BP company. I hate him, he's a total asshole. If he truly was like that in real life, well ...Deepwater Horizon deservedly honors the brave workers and heroes of that day. The story is detailed perfectly, the first act might be a little bit slow, but it compensates with the amount of characters that we care about by the beginning of the disaster. The performances are great (an Oscar for Wahlberg wouldn't be a surprise), the unbreathable pacing, from the moment of the first mud kick, is as real as it can be and Peter Berg's direction is flawless at all the other levels.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,0,1,6 August 2017
It," Rating: A
","By far, the best Stephen King's movie adaptation I've seen in years ... Well, I'm not saying much having in mind the most recent films, am I? So, to be absolutely clear: It is one of my favorite movies of this year!The story is very intriguing and mysterious during the whole runtime, therefore it doesn't allow a single dull moment or a misplaced scene. Tonally, the film switches between horror and slight bits of comedy (kids' banter) masterfully since it never feels that the funny moments are forced or without reason.Andy Muschietti flawlessly directs this movie. I honestly think it's one of those films that without this director, it wouldn't be even close to the success that it achieved. The way he explores and connects each one of the kids' fears and their backstory is truly unique, which elevates the screenplay even more. It's beautifully edited and the unconventional plot transforms It into something special.Even if Muschietti is technically perfect, the cast steals the whole show. I can't go through everyone, but keep in mind that every single one of the young actors has a fantastic performance. Besides, it's kind of awkward to point out flaws in kids' acting, but thankfully everyone is so great that I don't need to.Obviously, Bill Skarsgård is freaking terrifying as Pennywise. He's the cinematic proof that clowns can be strangely scary and I'm sure that now kids have a pretty good reason to fear them. Bill doesn't really show up as himself or without CGI that much, but when he does ... He portrays Pennywise brilliantly. From his laugh to his voice, he's perfect. Awesome job!Jaeden Lieberher plays Bill Denbrough, who is the main protagonist. He's the one that wants to find Pennywise at all costs and make him pay for all his crimes. Bill's story is remarkably emotional and compelling, something that Jaeden interprets amazingly. Sophia Lillis is a beautiful surprise as she represents Beverly Marsh! Her character's family issues and school problems make her feel real and she's probably the one who the audience is able to connect with better. Once again, another breakthrough performance from an unknown actress to me.Finn Wolfhard is by far the most recognized actor due to the success of Stranger Things. He plays Richie Tozier and if you ever saw one of Finn's interviews, you're not going to be astonished that Richie is basically Finn. He's the funny kid that's always teasing about the others' mothers and he's the main source of comedy through the whole movie. To my delight, he never gets annoying and the script for him is on-point.Finally, Jeremy Ray Taylor plays Ben Hanscom and he's the chubby kid that everyone loves because he's just so innocent and cute that everything he does and says is simply funny. The actor's expressions are hilarious, especially when he's sharing a scene with Sophia since their chemistry is marvelous.Actually, the whole cast's chemistry is off the charts, it feels like they have been friends since they were born! I also love the fact that this is a group of kids that entitles itself the 'losers' gang since all of them suffer some kind of bullying, either from colleagues at school or from family members. This detail instantly relates to almost everyone in the audience so there's every reason to root for them right from the beginning.As for flaws, I can't really find anything big. The jump scares work really well, but some just follow the cliché setup and they don't effectively scare me. I might flinch, but apart from one scene that I admit I was caught completely off guard, it's pretty standard.The one thing that I didn't fancy at all is the way that the bullies are handled. Not that they aren't required, but there are a few moments that seem absurd and too far from reality. I can only understand why one of the bullies is harassing the 'losers', but even that one does unimaginable things.All in all, It is one of 2017's best films and it's undoubtedly the best horror movie of this year. Andy Muschietti flawless directing skills elevate the screenplay and the scary scenes are indeed very creepy. However, the cast strongly shines with special praise to Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Jeremy Ray Taylor and, of course, Bill Skarsgård as the terrifying and beautifully designed, Pennywise. Excellent tone balance, amazing storytelling and great character development throughout the whole runtime, with the exception of the bullies that seem a bit off and even absurd.<ul><li>MSB Reviews | Full Spoiler-Free review on my blog :)</li></ul>",9,3,5,24 September 2017
A Star Is Born," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)In a world filled with disappointing reboots, sequels and prequels, A Star Is Born is a franchise built on critically-acclaimed remakes. The 1937 original film was a phenomenal success, and it received tons of awards and nominations, as the next two remakes (1954 and 1976) also did. So, Bradley Cooper had a tremendously tough job, especially since he is both the director, co-writer and male protagonist.He proves that not only he is an outstanding actor but also a pretty good director. He definitely has a bright future regarding this role, and he knows it. However, he undoubtedly shines as Jackson Maine, probably delivering his career-best performance. The range and emotion that he is able to bring to his character are Oscar-worthy. In fact, everyone deserves massive credit for what they have accomplished.Lady Gaga has shown in the past that she can be a very compelling actress, but I can't remember the last one to receive such a perfect character like Ally is for Gaga. I mean, it's not like Ally is Gaga, but it's undeniable the ease and comfort that the latter has in dealing with her character's personality. Despite this, she still surprises me and delivers such a beautiful and genuine display. I can also see her getting some nominations, but so far no one can beat Toni Collette on Hereditary.Nevertheless, a lot of people are going to overlook what might be the clearest award to give this year: Sam Elliot (Bobby) as Supporting Actor. When one of the most heartfelt and touching moments of the film comes from a no-dialogue scene with Elliot merely backing up his car, you know he's got the award in his pocket. Brilliant performance, filled with seamless acting. The biggest praise I can give to a movie's acting is that everything feels authentic and honest. It never crossed my mind that I was watching fictional characters because both the actors and the script depict life in such a ... lifelike way.Cooper and Gaga's chemistry is palpable, and that alone carries the entire story. As expected, since this isn't an original story (this sort of screenplay has been tackled hundreds of times), it gets a bit too long during the second act, becoming repetitive in its events and predictable. Nonetheless, the protagonists are so remarkably written and represented by such astonishing actors, that it is impossible to become bored. Every dialogue has meaning, every character moment is essential, and I couldn't get tired of watching Jackson and Ally going through their relationship.As I wrote above, Cooper's direction is pretty great. After reading some of his interviews and understanding how he filmed some scenes with such a low budget, I can't help but get genuinely proud of his work. From the chill-inducing stages with huge audiences to the uncut spectacles, he is a man who understands the craft. Everything is real. The stages, the spectators, the live concert ... Even if it wasn't live and they were lip-syncing, it's still jaw-droppingly impressive.My only issue regarding those on-stage scenes is the excessive use of shaky-cam. I understand that it might be necessary maybe to hide Cooper's inevitable mistakes playing the guitar or even his singing, but it reached a point where it was really giving me a headache. Despite this, I can't recall the last film that had so many original songs exclusively written for itself.As a music lover, I can't help but praise the marvellous songs and their passionate lyrics. Lady Gaga is one of the best voices of this generation, and she delivers some beautiful vocals. If Bradley Cooper's voice really sounds like that (apparently he went through years of training), then he's not human. If he was just lip-syncing, well ... He's a brilliant actor, then. Either way, the emotions and chills that the songs are able to generate are quite real, and I can't wait to listen to the whole soundtrack again.This movie has a beautiful message, and nowadays it feels that films no longer focus on that. Cooper and his team of writers achieved a fantastic screenplay which tells such a meaningful narrative. It has everything, from romantic, happy and musically amazing moments to more dramatically profound, sad and tragic scenes. Admittedly, it will leave a lot of people crying, and I love the ending, even if it is predictable.All in all, A Star Is Born's fourth remake continues the successful tendency at reincarnating the original's essence. Bradley Cooper is a gifted actor, soon to be an Oscar-nominated one, as well as a director with a bright future. Lady Gaga proves that she can also be an actress as amazing as she is a singer and Sam Elliot is a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor. A wonderful retelling of a tremendously emotional and dramatic story, filled with tears-inducing original songs and incredible chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, who carry the whole show. Go see it, bring some tissues and prepare to become addicted to its soundtrack.",8,3,6,12 October 2018
Wind River," Rating: A-
","I will start with Jeremy Renner because he undoubtedly steals the show. He is able to transform himself into an entirely different person, consequently delivering his career-best performance. Renner proves that he is more than just a mere superhero, he is a highly capable actor who brings out an astonishingly emotional display.Cory Lambert's script helps a lot Renner's performance since Taylor Sheridan's writing is, as usual, brilliant. Cory has an extremely disturbing and tragic past which the audience only understands near the beginning of the third act, hence elevating the character's backstory into something much more intriguing.The screenplay is wonderfully written. Sheridan is effective in avoiding forced exposition scenes with sharp dialogues, every conversation feels genuine. Additionally, some fantastic character development scenes support a truly captivating story that never has a dull moment due to its pretty well-controlled pacing and tone.If the writing is not enough for you to appreciate Sheridan's talent, then his work as the director will surely convince you. The action-heavy third act is amazingly filmed, it is packed with some unbelievable shootout and chasing scenes, including some flawless editing that helps the film's overall flow.The cinematography (Ben Richardson) feels as real as it could be, the setting is just beautiful and its colors brighten up the movie. Finally, the soundtrack really captures the environment of the snow mountains with some memorable tracks accompanying the narrative.This is one of the best films of this year, but I still have some issues with it. My main problem with the screenplay is based on the mystery itself, 'who killed the girl'? Even though this is a character-driven movie, its build-up surrounding the murder loses some of its impact when the moment of truth is finally revealed. The characters related to the killing feel a bit cliché and too superficial, so I do feel somewhat disappointed.You are probably wondering why I didn't write about Elizabeth Olsen yet. Well, that is because I have a nit-picky thing with her character. Olsen is great, she truly is! She gives a very compelling and passionate performance that will definitely offer her more opportunities for bigger projects in the near future.However, I think her character could have been given a more solid backstory to help the audience connect better with her. Jane Banner is far from the 'damsel in distress' cliché, in fact, she is able to stand her own against her attackers, but I find her essence very shallow.All in all, Wind River is one of my favorite movies of 2017! Jeremy Renner has his best performance yet and Elizabeth Olsen amazingly supports him, despite her character's simple background. Taylor Sheridan elevates everyone and everything with his marvelous writing and skillful direction. Stunning cinematography, an extraordinary score, a great protagonist and an extremely captivating story that never fails to entertain its viewers.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,2,5,28 November 2017
Unbreakable," Rating: A+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)What a movie! This is one of the most underrated films out there, and it was unfairly compared to The Sixth Sense at the time the former was released. These are two very different movies, but both of them have a lot of twists, which was what brought fame to Shyamalan's films, especially The Sixth Sense.Unbreakable follows that same methodology. It has a lot of twists throughout the runtime, and they are quite diverse: some are very technical twists, related to our point of view of a particular scene that, as it progresses, we always find ourselves tricked (these ones, most people either don't catch them or just don't care ... For me, it's proof of brilliant writing); the others are the prominent plot twists, where something unpredictable happens to the overall story.This movie has all of that and much more. The story itself is incredibly captivating since the main plot holds a lot of mystery and suspense, but these only work as well as they did thanks to Shyamalan, both director and screenwriter. His very unconventional way of storytelling and the anxiety that he's able to convey to some fantastic scenes, elevate the film while delivering a perfect narrative. It's even more mind-blowing the fact that this movie still makes so much sense and it didn't lose its replay value after 17 years!In fact, I bet it would be a striking success nowadays, where the superhero genre is over-saturated. Each year, we get more and more movies following the excessively used genre's formula that makes almost every blockbuster an instant box office hit. Unbreakable is nowhere near that formula, and I genuinely think that any fan of comic-book films must watch this one so everyone can understand what a 'grounded superhero movie' actually means. M. Night Shyamalan wrote a story that everyone can appreciate, without all of those big CGI fights and overwhelming visual effects. Comic-book fan or not, Unbreakable is the closest to what reality would be if superheroes really existed.Regarding the cast, Bruce Willis probably has his career-best dramatic performance in this film. He's terrific as David and I can feel all of the emotions which he wants to transmit to the screen. Samuel L. Jackson brilliantly plays Elijah, who has a real-life disease which SLJ portrayed beautifully and respectfully. The supporting cast is also worth praising since both Robin Wright (Audrey Dunn) and Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) play magnificent roles as the wife and son of David, respectively.Everyone helped Shyamalan direct exquisite dialogue sequences that extended for minutes without end. The editing and production of this movie are unbelievable ... and it was filmed in 2000! There are so many long, one-take scenes that explain in just a few minutes, everything you need to know about a character or a specific place or event ... Even a full action sequence is filmed in just one-take (the stunt work is also pretty efficient)! The soundtrack is so important, especially in the last act where everything comes to a conclusion. It's inspirational and even epic, I dare calling it. It's just perfect! Throughout the runtime, you can barely notice it due to how subtle it is. However, when it is needed to deliver a new layer of feelings, it always raises the moment.As discussed above, this is a M. Night Shyamalan film, so a very powerful twist right at the end needs to happen ... and it does. It gives the audience an unpredictable perspective about the whole story. I risk myself in saying that it isn't exactly necessary, but the truth is that it makes sense and it does bring the movie to a whole other level, so very, very well done! Finally, I just wish that this film had been released now. It is so much different than what we are used to watching and experiencing, that I dare to say it is one of the best movies inside this genre.Once again, Shyamalan shows the audience why was he becoming one of the most popular directors/screenwriters and proves that his rather unconventional storytelling, unpredictable twists and excellent direction are skills to praise more often. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson have great chemistry, but the former has his career-best dramatic performance. The editing, production, soundtrack and even the pacing of this film are entirely flawless, as well as the ending twist that leaves us with our jaws dropped. Unbreakable is one of the most underrated superhero movies ever, but it sits way on top as one of my favorites.",10,1,2,6 August 2017
Darkest Hour," Rating: B+
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Joe Wright brilliantly directs this movie, using very long takes and fantastic camera control to elevate Winston Churchill's powerful speeches. However, this film is only good because Gary Oldman executes a career-best performance. I've never experienced such a magnificent display of a historical character.Technically, the movie does not fail. The editing is seamless, the cinematography and the costumes feel extremely realistic, and the subtle score provides something extra to Oldman's flawless discourses.Nevertheless, Darkest Hour falls into the genre issues and cliches. It is far too long, having in mind that there is no sort of action or excitement during the whole runtime. It is a slow-burn and unless you especially enjoy this true-story adaptation filled with repetitive talks, I consider it just above average, solely due to one of the best displays from an actor I've ever witnessed.",7,0,4,2 March 2018
The Maze Runner," Rating: B-
","Wes Ball directs the movie-adaptation of the famous novel written by James Dashner, The Maze Runner. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find out he is stuck inside a huge maze with other young males, who have built a community on a 'field' surrounded by massive walls in the center of the said maze.With his memory erased, he has to figure out who he really is, what a mysterious organization named W.C.K.D. has to do what all of that and, of course, a way to escape.This film is full of surprises, some are great, some are horrible. The cast is the first good surprise with some amazing performances from pretty much everyone. Dylan O'Brien leads this movie surprisingly well, I did not expect such a high-level display from him since I was also not expecting such a fantastic start to the film. I just thought it was another book-to-movie adaptation to grab some undeserved money.O'Brien really embodies his character and makes his major share of the screentime worthwhile with some emotional scenes adding substance to the action sequences. Thomas is the type of character that instantly connects with the viewers because he is also in the dark regarding his situation and what the future holds for him and the other guys.Will Poulter (Gally) also achieves an outstanding performance by interpreting a more aggressive character who actually has pretty good reasons to act like he does. Kaya Scodelario is quite good as Teresa, but her character serves more as a plot device to develop Thomas and to advance the story than a real girl who ends up in the maze. Thomas Sangster (Newt), Aml Ameen (Alby) and Black Cooper (Chuck) also deliver some great performances, being Cooper the standout of the three.The Maze Runner is very well-directed by Wes Ball. The action scenes through the maze are suspenseful and tense, even though the scorpion-like creatures are too CGI on some occasions. The editing is clean and the isolated setting provides a claustrophobic vibe that elevates the overall beautiful cinematography. It certainly is a good-looking film, with some well-balanced tone and pacing, despite some unnecessary scenes.This movie offers an unconventional journey: for the first hour and a half, I was genuinely stunned with how captivated I was with the intriguing story. The film's premise is massively engaging due to the mystery in regards to the existence of the maze and to why are the kids there. The exposition scenes throughout the first two acts are incredibly well-executed and besides some nonsense lines here and there from any character, I thought this movie was going to be truly astonishing, but then the third act arrived.The ending completely shatters all of the film's logic. I mean, it is got to be one of the senseless endings to a movie I've seen in a long, long time. Being this the first installment of a trilogy, I knew I was not going to have all of the answers and that the screenplay was not going to have a definite end. However, I did not expect that a horrible exposition scene would finish the film by creating several plot holes that I do not think the next movies are going to address.The screenplay starts as a truly interesting and mysterious story and ends with Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) destroying any logic the film possessed. I am so disappointed that I am still trying to decide whether I give this movie a positive review or not. Honestly, even knowing a big part of the movie just does not fit correctly with its ending (which, by the way, is very predictable), I was entertained throughout almost all of the runtime and I don't think such a talented cast deserves to go down with the story.All in all, The Maze Runner self-destructs with the only horrible exposition scene of the whole film by throwing away all of its screenplay's logic. Some characters' script contains nonsense lines, but overall they are all well-developed through really well-directed dialogue scenes. Wes Ball uses the beautiful cinematography to elevate the claustrophobic setting and also achieves some cool chasing sequences with some sharp editing. The first two acts are worth watching and the movie's premise is super intriguing, but the last act, unfortunately, brings the whole thing down.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",6,0,0,25 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rating: B+
","I'm a huge Star Wars fan, I love the original trilogy, I mostly hate the prequels and last year's film was my number one pick for the best movie of 2015, so this is the movie I was definitely waiting desperately for since the start of 2016 ... And it did great!I'll start with my issues with this film because there are some major problems that need to be discussed. The one that's bothering me the most is the lack of emotional attachment that I had with the characters. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is the protagonist and the only character with a backstory supporting her, so I did care about her and I always wanted her to be on the screen. The same can't be said for the others!Captain Andor (Diego Luna) only gets a few seconds to express his feelings from his past, Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen) have a beautiful and super funny friendship, but I never got a single scene that explained why they were like that and K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) is the usual audience's favorite character due to his one liners and super funny scenes. However, when the character that you cared the most, besides the main one, of course, is a robot ... Something's not right. The emotional ending the director tried to achieve didn't quite have the desired effect.Governor Tarkin appears a lot in this film and, if you don't know, he was also a major character in the previous films of this franchise. The actor who portrayed him at the time was Peter Cushing (died in 1994) and here comes the issue: he portrayed him again. His CGI face is amazing, almost perfect like CGI is in the rest of the movie, but it's still a manipulated face and I can totally see it. I could never get used to it and I doubt that anyone can, it's too obvious and it takes away all the focus of his scenes. I'm not saying 'it's a lack of respect' like some critics' opinions, I actually think it was a great idea, but it should have been more subtle (like they perfectly did in the first scene he was in, with a mirror reflection).Since I'm in the dark side now, I should talk about Darth Vader. Hum, this one's hard to discuss. The Star Wars fan in me wanted one of the biggest villains ever to show up constantly and kill a whole bunch of Rebels, but the critic in me knows that it's not something I should've expected since I knew that he wouldn't have a big part. With this in mind, I find myself in between something that is a problem with the movie and something that is a problem for me. Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is the main villain of the film and he's as good as I could wish for, as well as the actor who did a great job. However, I did feel a little bit disappointed with so little Vader. He has an AWESOME scene near the end that totally gave me goosebumps and it's the scene that I'll watch time and time again, but I wanted more from him.The first act doesn't flow really well since there needs to be an introduction to all the characters and to all the places they are, which slows down the pacing. Jumping from place to place usually doesn't work, but it didn't last that long.Don't worry, I really enjoyed this film and I think it's a great one! The visual effects are the best I've seen in the whole franchise, with action sequences unbelievably awesome. The space battle is as entertaining as one can imagine and the CGI incorporated in the film is near perfection.I loved how they made this movie different from the others. The score is slightly different (great job, Michael Giacchino), the tone is also different: it's a time of war, the Stormtroopers are not as white- clean as before, not all of the Rebels are 'good' and there are a lot of people injured from the battles and constant attacks on the cities. After the first act, the pacing picks up and I'm in a fast, entertaining movie with great performances and characters.It's true that I didn't care that much about the characters by the end, but they're still entertaining. K-2So is super funny and I liked him very much, the friendship between Baze and Chirrut is compelling and funny as well, Andor and Jyn have the most serious parts and they're interesting and charming. All of the performances are good with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna having really great moments. Krennic is a good villain and Vader is awesome in every scene he's in (which are not that many).My main praise for this anthology film is something that I can't really explain, but Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope just got its decade- long complaint solved in the most amazing way possible. So many memes and gags around this one thing just got completely deleted from history ... Thank you! This is a movie that stands on its one, it can't really be compared with the others since it's so unique and I can't express myself through words how pleased I am with Gareth Edwards' work. Great job directing this film, amazing action scenes, either with ground combat and space battles, and a breathtaking last act.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is an action-packed film, with amazing visuals, great humor and funny characters. It does have some problems, it's not perfect, but it's not a bad movie at all. With my major issue being the lack of character's depth, this movie actually gives an entertaining two-hour runtime and a great time at the theater.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,2,8,6 August 2017
Captain Marvel," Rating: B-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As a fair and impartial film critic, I need to state this: I don't care about the controversy surrounding Brie Larson or the agendas this movie is trying to push or not. I'm not part of any hate group or factions that hate those hate groups. I just want to watch a good superhero origin film, that introduces me to a new character that I'm supposed to care about and root for. Read my review, sure, but make up your own mind. Go see the movie and be honest. Since that's out of the way, let's keep going ...It was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like Carol Danvers into the end of Phase Three. Not only she comes from nowhere (as far as I remember, she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before Infinity War), but it's the last movie before the climactic, era-ending Avengers: Endgame. She is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against Thanos, the bad guy who I dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment. So, while I was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action, I was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from Phase One.Unfortunately, that's exactly what I got. Everything is fine. Just okay. There's no exceptional fight scene, but most of it is decent. There's no visual wonder, but it doesn't look bad. The characters' potential feels wasted, but they work for the plot. Everything is frustratingly balanced, which is something I would praise in a bunch of other movies, but this isn't 2008 anymore. Marvel isn't starting its cinematic universe, it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments! I'm going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about: Goose ... Sorry, Captain Marvel! Jokes aside, this is one of the issues I was worried about going into the film theater. I escaped 99% of the marketing for this movie as I do with every other flick. I didn't watch a single clip/trailer, I know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and I kept my expectations realistic having in mind what I truly know about the film and only the film itself. The one thing I was not able to hide from were the headlines giving tremendous praise to ... a cat.Now, follow me on this: I'm going to watch a superhero origin movie. A whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen. I'm excited to know more about her, where does she come from, what her powers are and so much more. Some headlines show up on my social media feed, and I find that a CAT 'steals the show,' 'deserves a spin-off,' and I don't even know what more. Granted, the cat is indeed funny. It provides some chuckles here and there. That's it. I love cats, but I honestly can't figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things. Maybe it's because the rest of the film isn't that entertaining ... or perhaps just because people really, really love cats. Like the movie itself, I think it's a mixture of both options.Back to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about: Brie Larson. Marvel rarely misses its casting choices, and being Larson an Academy-Award winner, her talent is undeniable. She has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance, so I'm surprised that she couldn't stand out from the film's overall blandness. I repeat, the movie isn't bad, at all. However, I was expecting an actress of Brie Larson's caliber to elevate, at least, her own character, but she's like everyone else: just good enough. I don't know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions, but the potential is there, and I'm sure the Russo brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in Endgame.The two best attributes of the entire film are, without a single doubt, the buddy-cop relationship that Carol and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) develop, and the groundbreaking de-aging CGI. Story-wise, the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear. Carol's past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition, so it's a breath of fresh air to have SLJ and Larson play off of each other. Nevertheless, the de-aging technology used is absolutely astounding. My fellow readers, welcome to the future of filmmaking, where any actor/actress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing. I completely forgot SLJ is 70-years-old! The best visual effects/CGI are the ones you don't even know they're there and Captain Marvel succeeds in delivering mind-blowing, realistic, younger versions of well-known actors.Character-wise, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck should have done way better. So much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the MCU. Carol Danvers has a great backstory, but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact. Still, as Captain Marvel, she is indeed a badass woman! There are some cool action sequences, especially in the beginning, but as the movie slowly progresses on its story, the fight scenes got more sloppy, choppy and way too dark. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) is amazing as he always is, and Ben Mendelsohn is brilliant as Talos. Both characters have interesting subplots that come together well, which is not something that can be said for the rest of the Marvel 'villains.'Technically ... You guessed it, it's okay! Taking away the jaw-dropping de-aging CGI, the visuals seem to lack some sort of style. Looking back at Black Panther, Captain America or Guardians of the Galaxy, each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to their own stories. Captain Marvel doesn't really feel like it has its own style. I truly feel that with other directors, this film could have been way better. Boden and Fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers, but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster. That said, the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movie's period. There are a couple of moments where the VFX regarding Carol Danvers's powers are spectacular, but everything ultimately feels like this is a Phase One film, instead of the 21st MCU installment.All in all, Captain Marvel achieves the minimum requirements: introduce the fans to a new superhero, who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of Thanos. Carol Danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory, but the screenplay isn't structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible. Brie Larson delivers a strong performance, pushing aside her haters, even if I feel that under other directors, she would have reached her character's full potential. Her scenes with Samuel L .Jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie, as well as the groundbreaking de-aging CGI, which is absolutely mind-blowing. The action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography (this is MCU's Phase Three and 2019, so I want to be able to actually see what's happening), but the most prominent 'issue' is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin film's formula. This isn't exactly a flaw or a problem, it's just that I was expecting more. A lot more.In the end, there's not a memorable fight scene, an emotionally overwhelming moment or even a genuinely bone-chilling, epic scene. It doesn't leave you salivating for Avengers: Endgame, but it also doesn't leave you less excited. Everything is just ... fine. And there's nothing wrong with that. But there's also nothing extraordinary.",6,3,6,8 March 2019
Zootopia," Rating: A
","Zootopia surprised me a lot, it's one of the best animated movies of 2016! This is definitely a movie not only for kids but for adults as well. Actually, I think that adults will appreciate this film way more than their children.First of all, the story. How intriguing, captivating and surprising can an animated film be? Well, the levels are really high in Zootopia! It's constantly entertaining, fast-paced (except on a hilarious slow scene with a sloth), the mystery surrounding the case it's really interesting and the comparisons done with our real world are so well placed. Everything is addressed: from stereotypes to racism going through corruption and even drugs.Judy and Nick are amazing! They work so well together and it's beautiful to watch how they decided to follow completely different paths, even when their pasts are very similar. Both of them transmit such an important message of being whatever we dream of, not giving up and not showing your weak side. I had a blast watching this two fighting against crime and all of the stereotypes surrounding our world nowadays.It's really well animated with delightful details and with great supporting characters. Plus, some twists in the third act and a lot of funny scenes keep us entertained for the whole runtime. My only minor issue with this film are the constant exposition scenes throughout the movie, something I can understand since this is a movie mostly advertised for children, but it still bugged me a little bit, especially the opening scene.This movie is still awesome, it has great characters, a super interesting plot, some beautiful messages both for us and the kids, a really cool soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and two protagonists that are just amazing!<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,3,5,6 August 2017
Green Room," Rating: B-
","From that moment until the end, it's a disturbing and suspenseful movie, with the most captivating and intriguing plot of the year. This film has moments where I was almost unable to see some things ... How cool is that?! This disgusting type of suspense is so well placed in the movie because it needed to be like that, so it turned out to be a really amazing achievement in directing.For the first time ever, not caring about the characters wasn't a problem for me. The band's members are really stupid, they are that cliché-type of innocent people doing the dumbest things possible. You don't want the whole band to be murdered in cold blood, but you don't really root for anyone. The director already assumed that he's doing an 'inept protagonist' series, where the main actors portray stupid people that make bad decisions and they will have to suffer the consequences. Not sure if I should feel disappointing or just OK with it.The continuous suspense kept me on edge all the time and that is also due to two amazing performances: Patrick Stewart as Darcy and Anton Yelchin as Pat are really great. Now, I have a problem with Patrick Stewart and with the time that his character has in the movie: he's not well utilized, he doesn't have THE scene where I'd be so fascinated that I'd re-watch it a thousand times. He is so intriguing and so captivating that I just wish I could have seen more from him. Also, the mystery throughout the movie ('red laces') and the constant twists increase the suspense so much that keeps me on my toes until the end.Green Room is a great film, it's suspenseful, has great performances, but it could have had smarter (or not that dumb) protagonists and it should have had more of Patrick Stewart's character.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",6,1,7,6 August 2017
Us," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, you can read my review of one of my favorite movies of 2017, Jordan Peele's Get Out by clicking its title. One of the best feature-long debuts of all-time by a writer-director who I wish he discovered his filmmaker skills sooner because the horror genre urgently needed someone like him. Peele is starting to become one of Hollywood's most notable people, and he proves once again, now with Us, that his undeniable talent is going to leave our jaws dropped and our minds confused for quite some years. While I do think that his first film is more consistent and better structured, Us is so far the best movie of the year, and I doubt that it will stop being part of that list by the end of it.The best films are the ones that can transform a 45-min car ride back home from the theater into a blink of an eye. I spent all that time plus some more minutes discussing and arguing with my partner who I saw the movie with. By now, I have a pretty decent understanding of the film's story and of Lupita's character arc, which will definitely leave you extremely confused and mind-blown by the end of the movie. However, I will see it a second time to make sure my 'theory' aligns with everything else, especially those tiny little details we don't really think they matter when they actually do.Peele's screenplay is thought-provoking and suspenseful, filled with brilliant character development, and surprisingly well-filmed action scenes. I guess he knows how to do anything efficiently. The chasing scenes are riveting, and the fights are bloody awesome. In addition to this, most of the action occurs at night which requires the director to know what he's doing, so the audience is able to follow what's happening. I never, not once, lost my place during an action sequence. I knew who everyone was, where were they at, and what were they doing. Nowadays, having in mind how actual action blockbusters are being made, this is the best praise I can give a director regarding these type of scenes.A lot of articles are calling Jordan Peele the 'next Spielberg' or 'new Hitchcock'. I'm calling him the first Jordan Peele! I would have loved to be the one who came up with this last sentence, but I wasn't ... and I'm so happy about it. It means that more people are starting to plant into their minds that Peele is one of a kind, not one like the other. His trademark close-up shots right in the actors' faces can show and tell so much about a character. Besides that, the actors will have a golden opportunity to show their enormous emotional range, their incredible expressions, their limitless talent ... That is if you are someone like Lupita Nyong'o.Right after I watched Alita: Battle Angel, I called that it would get an Oscar nomination for Best Visuals Effects, and I still stand by it. Well, I also want to be the first to call not only an Oscar nom, but a Best Actress win for Lupita. Daniel Kaluuya was outstanding in Get Out, but Lupita surpasses his fellow comrade with two (!) powerfully captivating performances. As the original mother, she shows kindness and endearing traits. As her doppelganger, she's scary, menacing, and evil. Two completely different characters with distinct physical and psychological characteristics are no problem for Lupita. She handles them in such a flawless and effortless manner, carrying the entire narrative on her shoulders like it was nothing. She deserves every recognition there is.Nonetheless, she still received great help from the remaining cast. Winston Duke (Gabe Wilson) is hilarious, and he's the primary source of comedy throughout the film. With a remarkable balance of tones, Peele lets Duke shine in a role that he thrives on. Us can be very heavy and dark at times, so a good laugh here and there is always welcome. The young actors are also great, but I have to congratulate Shahadi Wright Joseph's performance as Zora Wilson. She has approximately the same age Amandla Stenberg had in The Hunger Games. At the time, I knew Stenberg would be an outstanding actress, and I was not wrong. Now, I'm 100% certain that Shahadi will be an exceptional one if she isn't already.Technically, I already wrote above how talented Peele is. From his seamless ability to film action sequences in the dark to his brilliantly-written screenplay, he nails almost every aspect of his movie. The score beautifully accompanies the narrative with cool, rhythmic songs when everything seems fine, and with loud, angelically weird voices that instantly change the tone. Flawless editing helps hide some nitpicks I have with some exposition scenes, especially towards the end. While I understand that the story has a lot to take in once 'explained', I believe Peele does so in a slightly too fast monologue that I think some people won't quite enjoy. For me, I would have loved total ambiguity. If they didn't explain a thing, I would have been ecstatic, but I understand the need to do it.My other gripe with the film is the other family, portrayed mainly by the always astonishing Elizabeth Moss (Kitty Tyler), and Tim Heidecker (Josh Tyler). Thinking about them and their importance to the story, I find that either they could have been better utilized or they shouldn't even exist. It's the middle ground between these two options that bothers me a little since it feels like these two remarkable actors, especially Moss, were left aside too much. They are indeed relevant to elevate the story as a whole, but I still wish they were explored a bit better.Sadly, I think audiences will like Get Out more, even though Us has more of the horror genre's traits than the first. Not only due to the story being more comfortable to follow and ultimately understand (some people actually left my theater way before the end ... shame on you!), but also because it has a definite ending. Unfortunately, people don't really like to think about a movie after it finished, so if it has some sort of open-ending, they're going to be mad. That's what happens if you go into Us expecting a cheap horror film, filled with cliche jump scares, and hollow characters. This is not a scary flick. It is a horror movie, and a phenomenal one. In case you want a simple, spoiler-free advice on how to approach the film's story, I'll leave just one small sentence after my rating.Jordan Peele is one of a kind. He is not like anyone else. Once again, he offers a thought-provoking, deeply layered, and incredibly suspenseful narrative. Captivating and entertaining from beginning to end, with no misstep along the way. Technically seamless, with his emotionally-driven trademark close-ups on the characters faces being a standout. Lupita Nyong'o delivers what I believe it's her career-best performance(s), which should grab her not only a bunch of award nominations, but wins as well. Brilliant cast, tonally well-balanced with hilarious comedy, and filled with excitingly scary action sequences.Us does not have a single interpretation. My perspective is not right or wrong, it's just my point of view. It's one of those movies you can watch time and time again, and each viewing will give you another insight that you missed before. However, I do think that what happens at the very end, it's true, and I have more than enough hints throughout the film to sustain my opinion. Despite some minor issues/nitpicks, it's undoubtedly the best movie of 2019 so far, and I highly doubt it will be out of my Top10 by the end of the year. Thank you, Peele, not only for giving us great horror films, but for being yourself. Go see it!Advice: focus on the boy's actions, and how he reacts to everything he sees or does.",8,14,50,20 March 2019
Knives Out," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Knives Out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can't deny that I was indeed affected by the whole 'a whodunnit like you haven't seen in years.' I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It's uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a 'bad' movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn't, he did other stuff, you know?). It's one of those films everyone knows it's going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.Even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole 'best X of the decade,' I'm going one step beyond). This is a film I know I'm going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who 'did it,' the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn't need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.This screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell's). It's been half-a-day since I've seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there's an answer lying on someone's words or actions. It's such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it's impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.I genuinely love the first act, even if it's the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn't waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It's through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn't, then it does again...That's one of the reasons I couldn't figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel 'intellectually superior' just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time's up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, 'I guessed it,' there's a 99% chance that they're either lying or not answering correctly to the question 'who killed Harlan?' If you've seen the movie, you'll understand what I'm trying to express.(I don't want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I'm not trying to say, 'I couldn't figure it out, so no one can.' Please, if you haven't seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)Throughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera's (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.However, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I've been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I'm ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he's been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it's sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.My only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It's like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell's Jacob and Katherine Langford's Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act's interrogatories. It's great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.In the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I've ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he's a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess 'who did it' beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It's an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don't miss it!",9,0,5,2 December 2019
The Irishman," Rating: A-
","It might not be Martin Scorsese's best film yet, but it's one more proof that he's one of the most talented filmmakers ever. With Robert De Niro delivering his best performance of the decade, Al Pacino going crazy and Joe Pesci brilliantly coming out of retirement, The Irishman is a wonderfully-written, (very) long story about friendship and life. The best editing (Thelma Schoonmaker) of the year makes the runtime smoother, but it still drags on for too long. I also feel that Anna Paquin's character should have had more impact. The de-aging VFX is mind-blowing, even if it takes a few minutes to get used to it.",8,2,5,30 December 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Rating: A-
","After Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it is time for Thor: Ragnarok to try and finish a very positive year for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), in great fashion.I find the previous Thor movies very interchangeable, they are not exactly great films, but they are still entertaining and enjoyable. However, Thor: Ragnarok elevates that same entertainment to a whole other level ... This is one of the funniest (!) and best movies of the entire universe.Opposed to the previous installments of the series, this one is tonally very different. The amount of comedy implemented in the screenplay and the outstanding humor make this film surprisingly hilarious and extremely fun. It is definitely a marvelous time at the theater and money very well spent.Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) fantastic direction is all over the movie. He is able to achieve a flawless balance between comedy, drama and action, something that most directors have trouble with. Consequently, the pacing feels incredibly controlled throughout the whole runtime. The 130 minutes fly like the blink of an eye and the film never has a dull moment, but it still slows down when it needs to, without becoming boring.Waititi also applies a very interesting, intriguing and unconventional way of storytelling, which truly helps the movie carry itself since the overall narrative isn't really unusual. The visual effects and cinematography are both remarkable but in the last act, the action requires a lot of CGI, which becomes too heavy in some brief moments. Due to the mostly fictional Asgard in the background, when the CGI isn't perfect, it feels like a video game ... Thankfully, I am just nit-picking a couple of shots that, in the end, didn't bother me at all.Eric Pearson's writing is distinctly exceptional with extremely hilarious lines and quite few exposition scenes (the ones that exist don't feel forced at all, except for one or two very concise bits). I believe that he is responsible for a big part of this film's sense of uniqueness and creativity, considering he provides excellent scripts for every character, upgrading each and every one of them and obtaining a more exciting movie.As for the cast, I just need to once again praise Marvel for its amazing choices, they keep nailing every single actor and actress they introduce to the MCU. Cate Blanchett is unbelievable! She is such a wonderful actress that she can portray a super cliché villain like Hela (Marvel's 'default' villains are something that I honestly hope Thanos can change) and bring a whole other dimension to the character. Thanks to her and an extraordinary script, Hela does not feel like (what could very well have been) a cheap villain.Tessa Thompson is another brilliant casting. Valkyrie adds a new layer of comedy and sass to the film, but her backstory is what gives both herself and Blanchett's character a bit more of depth. The surprise of the whole movie is Korg, a Kronan fighter portrayed by the one and only ... Taika Waititi! You are right, the director of Thor: Ragnarok has the funniest performance of the film! I am far from joking, his lines almost steal the whole show, there isn't a single scene with Korg where I didn't laugh like crazy. It is going to be the audience's favorite, without a doubt.As for the superstars, Chris Hemsworth proves that he is a perfect Thor. Both his acting and body shape are excellent for the portrayal of a god, he is able to be very compelling but also incredibly funny, carrying the story with no slip-ups. His chemistry with Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is palpable and their dialogue scenes are always at a great level of quality, both comedy and story-wise.Hiddleston is great as the evil brother, but Hulk is the one that stands out. The big green guy speaks more in this movie than in all of the others combined and he is freaking awesome! His witty one- liners hit every single time and his action scenes are amazing. There are also some short but very cool appearances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange),  Idris Elba (Heimdall) and Anthony Hopkins (Odin), plus a surprise performance from someone I won't spoil for you.Jeff Goldblum is always great, but his character ... I know this is not going to be a very popular opinion, but I find Grandmaster a bit annoying. Karl Urban has a good performance as Skurge, but just like Hela, both characters feel unexplored and pretty under- developed.My only real issue with the film is something I already mentioned above, which is the story itself. Even though Waititi's uncommon storytelling elevates it, the overall narrative is pretty much the default superhero story. Basically, if you have been alive for the past 10 years, there is nothing about the screenplay that is going to surprise you or blow your mind. Thankfully, the movie is so damn entertaining that the narrative becomes secondary to the all of the action and comedy predominant in the film.In conclusion, Thor: Ragnarok is definitely worth your time and money. It is undoubtedly the best movie of the series and one of the funniest in the MCU. Taika Waititi (with the help of Eric Pearson) molds a cliché narrative in his very unique and humorous way of storytelling, packed with hilarious comedy and phenomenal action scenes. A splendid cast with Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Cate Blanchett at the top of their game pull off some fabulous displays, but it is Tessa Thompson and Waititi (!) that steal the show with their distinguished performances, plus a big green badass that has a lot of funny one-liners.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,41,72,27 October 2017
Cloverfield," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, follow my blog :)A surprise going-away party between friends is interrupted when a monster of massive dimensions starts to destroy New York City. They need to leave the city before a heavy weapon is unleashed on it and rescue as many of them as they can.J.J. Abrams is one of the best producers in movie/television history, so a film with him and with the direction of Matt Reeves is definitely worth taking a peek.I don't recall watching a found footage movie ever, so when I first saw Cloverfield I was not that excited. However, I really enjoyed the film the first time and now that The Cloverfield Paradox came out, I wanted to review the previous two installments of the franchise, so here we are again.I read that a lot of people felt nauseated during this movie due to the shaky-cam that is used throughout the entire runtime, but I didn't feel that at all. In fact, even though I have no experience in watching films with this type of filming, I actually think this is a great directing achievement by Matt Reeves. He does an excellent job handling the camera like this, I rarely felt lost in space or didn't realize what was happening. I always know where everyone is compared to the others and sometimes this is difficult to achieve even with a steady-cam.Additionally, it helps to hide the 'ok' visuals effects which are not that great, even having in mind the year of the movie's release. Quality-wise, Reeves also implements some cool long takes which can battle the obvious issues that arise from a found footage film. The editing has its ups and downs since it is obvious that some scenes are too dark or too shaky to follow seamlessly. Plus, the movie repeats itself by having a lot of running with the camera looking down to the ground or way up to the sky/buildings.Some jump scares can't escape the cliche build-up which does not exactly help to improve the horror genre present in the film. The first act might drag a little too much in order to introduce the characters and their backstories. Besides, the setups for each character are really brief and this might not give you enough time to care about them. Nevertheless, I think I am one of the few people out there to actually love this movie!Yes, it has flaws. Yes, the characters are not amazingly compelling or extremely well-developed. But, by God, this film is awesome! The story is incredibly intriguing and the fact that it only runs for 84 minutes, just makes it even better. This is not a movie about a character's journey or an emotional drama with a meaningful message to deliver. It is a pure science fiction monster flick with a really cool action-heavy story and a freaking badass monster.It is a bit hard to distinguish good performances from the bad ones through a shaky-cam. That said, I think everyone is more than fine and Michael Stahl-David (Rob) excellently leads this film. Lizzy Caplan (Marlena) and T.J. Miller (Hud) also deliver some good displays. The characters they portray might not be unique or fully-developed, but they are introduced to us on a very personal level. Even though it is a very short first act, it does more than enough for me to at least care about their mission to rescue their friends.From the moment the 'event' occurs, I did not stop having fun, not for one minute. The build-up to the first appearance of the Cloverfield monster is brilliantly executed, every scene with a small flash of a part of its body is bone-chilling and this mystery vibe never fades away. There is never a dull moment and everything feels uncommonly realistic (the sense of urgency and danger is always present), the cinematography is pretty decent.Every act is better than its last, as the palpable action and the extreme suspense levels go higher and higher towards its fantastic ending (one that gives rise to well-deserved sequels). A lot of theories regarding the monster's origin have been developed and that is due to the last scene of the movie. After my rating, I will explain what happens since it might be a spoiler for the next films.All in all, Cloverfield is freaking amazing. I might be one of the few people truly loving it, but the issues with the shaky-cam or with the characters didn't affect me as much as it did with others. Excellent direction from Matt Reeves, very entertaining screenplay from Drew Goddard and fantastic production of J.J. Abrams, who clearly has a heavy hand on this. The cast works fine for the plot which is the reason why this movie is a success. A science fiction monster film at its best, with suspenseful action and a tremendous sense of urgency. It has a more than satisfactory control of the shaky-cam and a mysterious ending that deserves some exceptional sequels.Rating: A-****************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
In the very last scene, we see Rob and Beth (Odette Annable) near the beach. We can see the sand and the whole ocean with a beautiful wide shot. Knowing J.J. Abrams, this couldn't be just a random ending to a sci-fi movie. It is extremely easy to miss, but if you pay close attention to the upper right corner of the screen, you will see something falling from the sky into the water.Some say it was the monster arriving at the planet. Some think it was something like a satellite or a meteor and that it had awakened the monster living at the bottom of the ocean (during the film, Hud actually says something regarding the monster's origin being the deep ocean and that he had crawled up through an opening ... Once again, knowing J.J. Abrams, this is a hint not just random funny dialogue).Which one do I think it is true? Well, I am strongly in favor of the satellite theory, but I will explain myself better in my next review of 10 Cloverfield Lane.",8,2,2,24 February 2018
Ready Player One," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Steven Spielberg hasn't directed a science-fiction film since 2005's War of the Worlds so obviously, my expectations were high for this adaptation of the famous novel written by Ernest Cline, who also co-writes the screenplay for this movie. Well, I am going straight to the topic that everyone is going to talk about for weeks: the pop culture references and Easter Eggs spread throughout the film.Even before the movie started, I was already focused like a hawk. I knew that a ton of references would show up, so my eyes were constantly looking at the background for hidden hints and my ears were listening to every single word, in order to catch any reference to a film, game, music or even an anime ... However, this is one of the reasons some people will hate this movie.I think I have never watched a film with so many Easter Eggs. I mean, the whole premise and concept of the movie are based on that, so I was prepared to be overwhelmed with pop culture references from every side. A lot of critics will think that they don't make sense or that the film has no structure whatsoever. The general audience will probably be 'ok', even though they will never appreciate the hundreds of references that they don't understand.Truthfully, I love it. The nerd in me will never get tired of catching Easter Eggs and I felt extremely entertained during the whole runtime. There are characters from other movies, vehicles and weapons from other games and even some nods to specific animes. The score is incredible and very nostalgic which tremendously elevated every action scene. I agree that the story might be filled with too many references, but honestly, I don't care. Let them come!In another film, it would probably bother me but when the whole story is based on the concept of 'egg hunting', there isn't a single Easter Egg that takes me out of the movie or that doesn't make sense. The virtual world Spielberg created is visually stunning and it feels realistic, awkward as that might sound. The OASIS is something that I can actually imagine existing in real life, 30 years from now. The world-building skills of Spielberg are intact and there is no one better than him to adapt Cline's book.The action is music to my ears. No one handles a chasing scene better than this director. Animated or not, he is flawless. An amazing race scene at the beginning compensates the lack of interest in the first expositional 15 minutes, where voice narration takes over. The explanation of how the OASIS works is not really necessary since everything is pretty easy to understand by showing it to the viewers.Until the end, the fast pacing never opens space for a dull moment. The 2h20 minutes run smoothly and the third act has a climax battle worthy of jaw-dropping moments. Inside the virtual world, there are very few flaws to point out. The Easter Eggs which the players have to find are not that hard to decipher, but it is still captivating to watch them trying to figure them out.My main issue with the movie is when it comes back to the real world. Besides Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), no other character has any development whatsoever. Even assuming their avatars are an extension of their personalities, the supporting characters lack some growth. In the real world, the danger and the sense of urgency never feel authentic and some plot points can't escape the genre's cliches.The story also tries to force out a romance that never has a ground to start off from. I believe the way love grows between these characters outside the OASIS, but the way it starts is as far as realistic as possible. On the other hand, the cast is awesome. Sheridan and Cooke have unbelievable chemistry and they carry most of the film on their shoulders. Ben Mendelsohn portrays a cliche and over-the-top 'villain' (Sorrento), while T.J. Miller (I-R0k) is super funny as his sort of sidekick.Tonally, Spielberg should have done better when the action is going on in the real world. I wanted to be in the OASIS all the time, so the movie kind of drops its entertainment levels a tiny bit when we come back 'outside'. Still, I haven't felt this entertained by a sci-fi film in years! Every shot has some sort of reference and I just love those kinds of stuff, no matter how many there are. I understand if it is overwhelming for some people, but for the nerd that I am, I couldn't love it more.All in all, Ready Player One is a movie created for nerds, whether you want to admit it or not. Yes, the story has a lot of cliches. Yes, some characters lack development and the real world stakes don't feel anywhere near realistic. Yes, there is a stupid romance. But damn, I was entertained! Spielberg's world-building skills are outstanding and the OASIS is a virtual place where pop culture references 'pop out' on every shot. Overwhelming? Definitely, but I love it! Sheridan and Cooke carry the film and their characters are formidable. The action scenes are jaw-dropping, the visuals are gorgeous and the score is incredibly nostalgic. I can't wait to see it again and catch some more Easter Eggs! Go watch it and happy 'gunting'!",8,0,2,30 March 2018
"I, Tonya"," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I, Tonya is one of the best movies based on real-life events that I've seen recently. Being a genre that I usually don't feel amazed by, Craig Gillespie tells a very well-written story by Steven Rogers. Very interesting and captivating screenplay, I was invested throughout most of the runtime and I think the pacing is extremely well-balanced, something that is a common issue in this kind of films. Gillespie also makes a great decision by telling the story through different perspectives since the interviews with the real Tonya and Jeff are highly contradictory (as the movie states right at the beginning of the movie).The cast's performances definitely elevate the film. Margot Robbie (Tonya Harding) might not win the Oscar this year, but her display proves that she has her hands on one in the future. However, Allison Janney (LaVona Golden) portrays Tonya's mother flawlessly (even if the character might have been stretched, as well as some aspects of the real story) and she is my frontrunner to get the Best Supporting Actress award. Great performance from Sebastian Stan (Jeff Gillooly) as well.Great cinematography, excellent editing and beautiful use of the CGI for the skating scenes. Tonally, the movie could have been better controlled and it feels that both the story and its characters are certainly exaggerated and distant from (some) truths. The entertainment levels are high, even though the film sometimes feels too long.",8,0,0,27 February 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Rating: B+
","One thing that I just loved from the get-go is that this movie assumes that you know Peter's backstory: the death of Uncle Ben, the whole radioactive spider thing, etc. It just starts right after the events of the epic airport battle and this is something that's new and fresh. I really didn't want or needed another origin film with the exact same sequences of the last two series.So, is Homecoming a great movie or not really?! It's pretty good. It's not perfect, it has its flaws, but it's by far the best Spider- Man movie since the '04 second installment of Sam Raimi. The fact that the story goes in a different direction, with some different characters is definitely a plus, but it also has some familiar characters that are slightly different from the previous films or comics, which is also a plus for me IF it doesn't turn the movie into the wrong path (which it doesn't).Tom Holland showed some of his soul and humor in a few minutes in Civil War and now he has the opportunity to actually prove what he is made of ... Oh my, how great is he?! In my opinion, he is the best on-screen Spider-Man ever! He's compelling, captivating, funny and he actually looks and acts like a teenager. There are a lot of scenes where he shines and proves that he's one of the best castings Marvel has ever achieved.In case you're wondering, Robert Downey Jr. doesn't show up that often in the film (every movie needs its marketing scheme) and when he does show up, he's there more for the comic relief moment than for an actual story or character development scene ... Except for this one incredible character defining moment with Holland, that I think it's brilliant and it captures the whole 'with great power comes great responsibility' vibe. I loved it as I love the 'father- son' relationship going on between Iron-Man and Spider-Man.The villain. If there's one thing Marvel and DC Comics keep failing at is their villains, they are always these bad guys that love to destroy things and they want to kill everyone just because it feels good or whatever ... Not Vulture, not Michael Keaton. His backstory is captivating and even emotional, we learn the struggles he's been through life and how hard he wants to protect it. The first 15 to 20 minutes of the movie's runtime are dedicated to the villain, which is a pretty uncommon method to follow, but it works brilliantly. Keaton delivers as expected and elevates his character even more with his amazing performance.The script is great, it is smart and extremely hilarious. It also focused more on telling a Peter Parker story as a teenager instead of just expanding the MCU by throwing some badass Spider-Man action scenes and this is what Marvel struggled at the beginning with the origin stories of its heroes, but it has been pretty much solved since the first Avengers film.There's a great twist in the transition to the third act that transforms it into a much deeper and emotional final standoff between our superhero and the villain. Also, there are two post- credits scenes, so make sure you stick to the end.So, what bogged the movie down for me? There are a lot of tones throughout the film: there's comedy, then action, then drama, then romance ... The balance of it all isn't as smooth and fluid as it should be, which affected the movie's pacing (during the second act, it briefly becomes a little boring).However, my main issue with the film are the under-developed secondary characters. Besides Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), who actually gets a lot of screen time, the rest of the cast are basically either stereotypical teenagers or plot devices. I know that they're not the key to a great movie neither the big focus of attention, but when they're so connected to the superhero's personality and daily routine, I think they should have been way more explored (especially when one of the characters is directly linked to the big twist).One way to solve the previous problem would be to balance the action scenes with those needed character-development moments. The action is mostly fine, but that's it. It's fine, it's not bad, but it's not great. It is entertaining, it is visually appealing and it has its beautiful comic moments, but it's far from being awesome (for example, I don't have the need to go on to Youtube and search for THAT amazing unforgettable scene because there isn't one ... ).All in all, Spider-Man: Homecoming delivers a very entertaining reboot of the series and it fits perfectly into the MCU. Tom Holland is the best on-screen Spider-Man ever, Michael Keaton is brilliant as the fully-developed Vulture and the script is super smart and extremely funny. A few tone balancing issues affect the film's pacing, the side characters are under-developed and the action didn't wow me, but it didn't change the fact that I loved this movie.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,0,2,6 August 2017
Suicide Squad," Rating: C+
","Will Smith as Deadshot is great, it's his best performance in the last few years and his character has the most interesting and heartfelt backstory. There's even a scene with another character from the DCEU (DC Extended Universe) where he shows the first signs of humanity present in him and that is really cool to watch. He is also the main source of entertainment and fun in the film, he basically throws his Will Smith's charisma in there and it works really well. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn portrays perfectly this known character from the comics, she's exactly like I wanted her to be. She gets that crazy insanity just right, she's super funny and also has some moments of humanity throughout the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is really great as well, I can't say too much about her (no spoilers in here), but I honestly can't wait to see her again in future installments. She's bad-ass!Batman (Ben Affleck) appears in the movie for a couple of scenes and he's awesome, Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is a pleasant surprise, he actually has a personality in this film and The Joker (Jared Leto) ... Is fine. I'm really not sure of how I feel about this interpretation of one of the most famous villains ever. Jared Leto tried to mix the vibe of the previous actors that portrayed this character (Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson) and I guess I'll have to wait until another movie is released because The Joker barely has a scene in this one ... With this in mind, I move on to my list of cons, which are more than I expected.The Joker isn't relevant, at all, in this movie. The trailer and all of the advertising for this movie is a complete fraud! They tried to make him the villain until the release because they weren't sure that Deadshot and Harley Quinn were enough to sell this movie. He has some good scenes and that's it ... Disappointing. Also, there are some other characters that are in the film without a purpose: Katana (Karen Fukuhara), Slipknot (Adam Beach) or even Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) ... They're just there because the film needed them to form the squad, I guess.The first act is good, but it's so choppy and has a lot of flashbacks. In fact, the whole movie has flashbacks thrown into it with no structure whatsoever, either 10 minutes into the movie or 10 minutes before the end of it. Not that they're bad, actually they're pretty interesting and the best part of the movie (some actually would give a good story for a solo movie), but so badly edited. The beginning is total exposition, we have this whole set of flashbacks and cuts to set up these characters. I understand they need to introduce them, but they do it in such a lazy way, literally like, 'Hey, this is Deadshot. He shoots people and has a daughter. Care about him.'. It's definitely not the best way to do it. It's a shame that a film with so many great characters under- utilizes them so much.The other two acts are literally a mix of different scenes that turn into one big mess. I know for a fact that after Batman V Superman received some negative reviews about the darker tone present in the movie, the producers re-shot a lot of scenes just to add a little more of a lighter vibe to Suicide Squad. That just made things worse, they try to put together a darker and lighter tone at the same time and it doesn't work out. Even the soundtrack, which I thought would be amazing (and it was in some scenes), comes out completely wrong in some moments. It's a complete mishmash.Another problem with this movie is the main villain, who kind of remained omitted since in the trailers it was almost all The Joker. I don't consider it a spoiler, you probably know already who this character is, but still, I'm warning you ... Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) is a witch that can control people's minds and apparently dance ... Yes, that's all she does in 90% of the movie, dance. She stands in the middle of the city for the whole time just moving her arms around and pretending she has a hula hoop in her hips. She couldn't be less of a plot device for the squad to have a purpose and do something, I don't even blame the actress because she had to spend most of her time looking at a green screen and speaking some strange language. I actually liked the introduction to this character, the first time she turns into Enchantress is amazing, but after a subway scene, she becomes CGI awful.The ending is terrible, it remembered me of Fantastic Four's ending of last year ... It's that bad. Literally, there's a character who is definitely dead, it has 'tentacles' going through its body and after 5 minutes ... It's fine, nothing happened, clothes are clean, everything's perfect. The plot given for the squad doesn't make a lot of sense when you have superheroes like Batman, Wonder Woman, or The Flash in this universe ... Why would a girl with a bat or a guy that shoots really well fight a super-powerful being that can destroy them in seconds if he wishes to? Just wait until you know how they kill them and stop the beacon ...I really expected more of this movie, it has really great characters, some amazing performances from the cast, some funny scenes, but the story is unstructured, the action isn't that good (the 'monsters' that they have to defeat along the way are at the level of a Stormtrooper) and the plot doesn't really make sense.Not bad, but disappointing.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",5,0,0,6 August 2017
Doctor Strange," Rating: B+
","I watched this movie in 2D. Yes, I know, what a huge mistake! I actually have some minor issues with the action scenes that I'm positive I wouldn't have if I watched this movie in 3D...  I'll try to watch again on IMAX sometime soon because this movie is great!Some people might call this a typical superhero origin movie and they're not wrong, it is ... That doesn't mean the movie is bad! Deadpool is also an origin story and it still is one of the best movies of the year! Obviously, it's not as conventional as the others, but if you read my introduction above, you can basically say the same about Deadpool (a guy with a normal life -> accident -> gets superpowers - > a bad guy comes along -> he has to defeat him). Doctor Strange might not have the uniqueness of Deadpool, but it's still a well-told story.Starting with the pros, this is easily the most beautiful film of the MCU. The visual effects are unbelievable stunning, the action sequences (even if with some minor video-game-like scenes) are gorgeous and the Inception-like building's distortions are mind- blowing. There's a scene where Strange 'travels' through this new world of magic and this is THE SCENE! The one that everyone will talk about at the end of the film, the one that you will watch thousands of times on Youtube and the one that you'll never forget! The only thing I can say right now is 'congratulations' to the visual effects team, they just won themselves an Oscar!If there's one thing that DC could take from Marvel, it would be the cast and the production team. Once again, the director did an excellent job with a perfect staff and all the actors and actresses were brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch didn't go out of his comfort zone at all since Sherlock Holmes and Stephen Strange have a similar personality, so he just nailed his performance! He perfectly captioned the egotistic, smug, cocky, funny and HUMAN doctor. Human because, even after he learns his powers, he doesn't forget who he is, he's still arrogant, but when he kills someone he's truly affected by it! He's still a doctor, he saves lives, so killing really triggers him and Cumberbatch is amazing demonstrating that.Tilda Swinton was the one that I was always so intrigued to see and hear. The Ancient One is a very mysterious character and every time she talked I felt dragged by her voice into this 'full-attention mode'. She was thrilling and I have no words to describe how surprised I was when I met this character. Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the right-hand of The Ancient One, he follows her lead and trusts her blindly, which gives him the motivation to do what he's going to in the sequel. Ejiofor also did a great job in showing the strict personality that his character has, the full respect for the laws of nature make him question everyone that breaks them. Master Wong, who is played by Benedict Wong (coincidence?), is an extremely fun character. The interactions between him and Strange were super funny and I was always with a smile on my face when he was on the screen.Kaecilius is as good as his actor, Mads Mikkelsen. He is not supposed to be the main villain since there's a higher power, but he has a lot of screen time. The oh so powerful villain appears for like 5min and Kaecilius is the one that has all the attention. Don't get me wrong, he's a good villain with more than understandable motivations (he actually has a very intriguing backstory), but he wasn't the biggest evil to fight against (he was basically a puppet for someone else to achieve a greater objective). This time Marvel's villain wasn't as effective as the other times.Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) is the college and lover of the famous doctor ... And the 'romance' didn't work. McAdams is perfect in the scenes that she's in, which are very few and that's the problem. Literally, if you take out all the scenes where Palmer shows up, there's only one that saves this character. If Lois Lane was the damsel in distress on Batman V Superman, Christine Palmer was the doctor that was only necessary when our heroes were hurt and that's too little for a character of this importance. This is by far my major issue with this film.The other issue would be very few scenes from the action sequences that seemed very video-game-ish and some other scenes where it was too much of a camera just moving too fast for us to see ... I don't know if it was because of the 2D, but I feel that I should have liked more the overall action of this film that I did (to make it clear, I did like it! I just expected more in some parts).This is a classic superhero origin story, with an amazing score by Michael Giacchino and a lot of Marvel's usual comedy (they're getting better and better on implementing some belly-laughter humor on their films, the audience and I were laughing so hard throughout the whole runtime). Excellent cast, great directing and BRILLIANT, STUNNING, JAW-DROPPING production and visual effects ... God, I really need to see this one on IMAX!<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,2,2,6 August 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Rating: A
","The movie with the biggest title of 2017 (I think?!) tells the story of how Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) handles her daughter's murder, which still does not have any suspect after several months. She pays for three billboards with a clear message to the chief of Ebbing's police, William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson).Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a violence-driven officer and close friend of William, join the fight against Mildred and a very dark comic drama unfolds.One of the films I am only now getting the chance to watch due to its late Portugal's release and it is also one of the few movies I still have some big expectations for it to be part of my list featuring the best films of 2017 ... Well, I can spoil you right away: it is definitely part of my top10! You can check my updated list here!I will start with what I think is the movie's strongest point: its screenplay. Martin McDonagh exceptionally elevates the story and flawlessly balances the film's several tones, from very dark mysterious drama to simple comedy. I mean, this movie really has everything: drama, comedy, mystery, extremely shocking scenes, suspenseful dialogues, incredible character development and plot twists that kept me constantly focused on the screen. It is superbly written, it has no crappy exposition scenes and it offers something to the viewer that films rarely do: doubt.I can't possibly count the moments where I switched in favor of a character instead of another. The storytelling is really thought-provoking and I both supported and repressed every single character's actions at some period during the movie. This film causes uncertainty in relation to who should I support? Who belongs to the 'good side' and the 'bad side' of this whole thing? Everyone's point of view has reasons to be more than understandable, every character is amazingly well-developed and every scene is filled with so much tension and suspense, but also with a lot of heartfelt and compelling moments.The story plays out like I never thought it would. There are so many minor plot twists, either related to a character or to the main script, that are utterly mind-blowing. They all make perfect sense, there is never a loose thread and every character's choices are justified with creative storytelling, which takes the movie to a whole other level. McDonagh also does a spectacular job as the director ...Fantastic one-take scenes that raise the tension up a notch, a brilliant use of the realistic cinematography and an excellent use of some unusual camera angles. The editing is seamless, the pacing is handled to perfection without a single dull moment or a misplaced scene and the score is genuinely addictive. Furthermore, the feeling of watching two different films is never present due to the wonderfully balanced tone and for a movie with so much shocking drama, I left the theater with so many great laughs because the tonal shifts are perfectly executed.Moving on to the cast, Frances McDormand, my God. How can someone be so badass? She is awesome! No wonder she is nominated for Best Actress at every award show, she clearly deserves it. A terrific performance with a range of expressions that go beyond most actors' capabilities, astonishingly well-balanced emotions (she goes through a lot of dramatic, comic and emotional scenes) that she nails in a McDormand-way.Mildred Hayes is one of the most strong and powerful characters of 2017, period. She has to deal with so much and she stands her ground vigorously. In a way, she is a role model for every single person out there: if you believe you are doing the right thing, then do it and do not let anyone stand in your way or change your mind ... Just don't do some more aggressive stuff that she does, I don't think you would get away from some good jail time.However, a few times she does become the 'villain'. She has no idea what other people are going through, but the movie always tries to justify her impulsive violent reactions with what she is suffering from. So, when the tables turn, she is also 'culpable' (as she says in the film at some point) of both her and, for example, Bill Willoughby's actions, who is passionately interpreted by Woody Harrelson.Harrelson has one of his best heartfelt and emotional performances ever. Bill's personal issues are the most shocking subplot of the movie and Woody handles his character's grounded yet funny personality in such a compelling way. Bill's choices lead to consequences that converge in an unconventional path and it is truly something that ultimately drives the movie to the remarkable story that it possesses.Sam Rockwell is also receiving a bunch of nominations and he undoubtedly works for those. Jason Dixon is the character that goes through more personality changes due to all of the bizarre things that happen in the story and it is very hard for an actor to start as one character and basically end with a totally different one. Rockwell embodies Dixon and completely transforms this character. Once again, the scripts are phenomenal (for every character), but the cast takes them and turns them into something special.In case you are wondering, no. Peter Dinklage (James) is not in the film just to receive a pay-check. No one is. Every single character that is introduced into the story is very well-developed and they all have an important share of the runtime. Dinklage nails his performance, as well as Lucas Hedges (Robbie) and Caleb Landry Jones (Red Welby).I only have a couple of minor issues with the film. Every act is strong on its own, each having their jaw-dropping moments. However, the third act finishes with an ending that I don't appreciate that much. I can't be detailed, but I don't think McDonagh had just one ending in his mind, I am just a bit disappointed that he chose this one, which is still a great ending!My other issue has to do with the only character that simply does not fit in the movie's environment: Penelope (Samara Weaving). This character is not needed and it is so annoying. Her cliche stupid personality is the only element in the entire movie that simply does not make any sense. Fortunately, she is only on the screen for a few scenes. Weaving is not bad or good, she just suffers from the character she has to portray.All in all, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as amazing as the length of its title. Martin McDonagh produces a multi-genre, thought-provoking screenplay with excellent pacing and tone control. He is also brilliant as the director, using long takes and the realistic setting to its advantage, making the movie even better and still counting with a memorable score. All-star performances from Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell take the movie to a whole other level, but with an ending that is not as great as it could be plus an annoying character (Penelope) that thankfully does not share much of the screentime.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog!</li></ul>",9,2,5,29 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Rating: C
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you don't know by now, I'm a massive Star Wars fan. I love the original trilogy, but the prequels... not so much. However, Disney's sequel trilogy has delivered two of my favorite movies of the whole franchise, so its conclusion was obviously one of my most anticipated moments of the year. If that wasn't enough to leave everyone excited, add the fact that it also means the end of the Skywalker Saga, and the pressure suddenly becomes 10x heavier. I went in with moderately high expectations, with not even a glimpse of any trailer or TV spot, just like I did with Avengers: Endgame. The latter surpassed my expectations and delivered a near-perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga...The Rise of Skywalker is a tremendous letdown. I won't sugarcoat it. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that J.J. Abrams wouldn't be able to offer a satisfying end to the nine-episode story, I would laugh like crazy. It disappointed me so much that I don't even want to extend this review more than the usual. I know that a lot of people hated The Last Jedi, but for better or worse, that film exists. Rian Johnson's decisions were made. Some people received them well, some didn't. But all of us got to watch and experience his narrative.There's something called artistic integrity, which J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio completely forgot about. The lack of respect for the saga's previous installment is baffling. The structure-less screenplay is so unbelievably convoluted that it reaches a point where evident logical issues come into play. Major plot points occur due to some genuinely hard-to-believe events, and even the characters seem to have no path whatsoever. It's entertainment for the sake of entertainment.Of course, there are a lot of visually jaw-dropping action sequences. The cinematography (Dan Mindel) is some of the best I've seen in the franchise and in this year. John Williams' score is emotionally compelling, and it definitely elevates a lot of important moments, being a big source for the chills down my body. And yes, there are a bunch of epic scenes. However, throughout the whole runtime, the frustration was always there. Major threads and character backstories were answered in The Last Jedi, but The Rise of Skywalker feels more like another sequel to The Force Awakens than to Rian Johnson's flick.If there's one undeniable aspect about this trilogy that this last movie proves is that there was no plan. No roadmap. No overall structure. Whether you love or hate each or every installment, this is indisputable. Disney screwed up this time. Creative freedom is essential to filmmakers, but the production team behind a franchise needs to have a well-organized structure. The simple fact that J.J. Abrams directed the first film, left and returned to do the third one, is already weird and uncommon by itself.Besides the lack of artistic integrity, there's this feeling of constant disappointment throughout the movie. On several occasions, The Rise of Skywalker is so close to delivering a perfect sequence. A chill-inducing moment. An incredibly emotional scene. Almost every time, it fails at the last second, at the last line of dialogue, or at the last action movement. Some moments are still captivating, and they don't lose that much impact. Nevertheless, some are totally destroyed by the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy choices I've witnessed in the saga.The first act is devoid of any thought. Characters go to places to get something they need to another place so that in that place, they find something else that leads them into another place... It's frenetic, out-of-control pacing. The desperation to set up so many different side stories in time is so prominent that it's visible from another galaxy. From the second act on, things get a bit more clear, and in the third act, all the threads blend decently. It's in the last 30 minutes that the resemblances to Avengers: Endgame come into play. The only difference is that it doesn't have 1/10 of the emotional impact due to the questionable decisions I mentioned above.Only one character got his arc complete without detours or significant changes: Kylo Ren. J.J. set him up, Rian Johnson continued his journey, and J.J. closed his arc pretty well. Every other character either got their arcs complete with major changes throughout, or they didn't come close to finish their own story. There's one exception, though, and that's Carrie Fischer's Leia. It would be extremely disrespectful and unfair for someone to criticize the filmmakers about her. They inserted her reasonably well in the scenes (please, if someone complains about visual effects, just get lost), and they did the absolute best they could under the known circumstances. I might be extremely disappointed, but I do have to send the team my congrats for closing her arc in the most dignified way possible.As for everyone else... well, the cast has been outstanding from the very beginning. Adam Driver, I have no words for him. He's so perfect as Kylo Ren that I even defend his character as a villain more layered and emotionally complex than Darth Vader. I love Daisy Ridley as Rey, and she does a phenomenal job in this last film, even when her dialogue doesn't entirely suit her. John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and everyone else (who I won't mention due to possible spoilers) are all brilliant, and I have to congratulate them on making every single movie a bit better.I don't know what more should I write. I have very mixed feelings about it. I love a lot of the epic moments, the film looks absolutely stunning, and the action sequences are genuinely jaw-dropping. However, I strongly disagree with some decisions made by J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio, especially the ones that make The Last Jedi feel like it didn't exist. This lack of artistic integrity plus the constant disappointments regarding each big moment's climax ruins one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Despite the brilliant performances from the cast, only Kylo Ren got his arc complete without significant changes. The Force Awakens set up some mysterious questions. The Last Jedi answered them. The Rise of Skywalker... also answered them. It's one of my biggest letdowns ever, but I'll still save the Skywalker Saga close to my heart. Next time, just build a roadmap, Disney...",5,1,4,23 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Rating: B+
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Some movies are just not what they look like. When I discovered what Pacific Rim was about, I instantly thought 'well, here we go again with another Transformers film but with monsters instead'. However, Guillermo del Toro was the director, so I had to give it a chance. Thankfully, I was extremely surprised! The main characters are well-developed, each one has a powerful and emotional backstory, plus distinct personalities. Idris Elba is a freaking badass, but the standout of the movie is Rinko Kikuchi. She is incredible and her range of expressions is astounding. Excellent work from Rinko, who elevated her already well-written character. Charlie Hunnam gets a lot of scrutiny from critics, but I usually stand on his side. However, even though he isn't bad, I didn't feel the emotions that he was supposed to transmit in more compelling moments. He doesn't bring the film down, but he also doesn't elevate it.The story is actually captivating (it even carries some twists that change the course of action) and the action is visually jaw-dropping. I mean, there are Godzilla-like monsters fighting better-designed Transformers and most importantly, del Toro is at the command. Even if he is more used to work with prosthetics, he nails the CGI. Additionally, most of the action is set on water which is known to be a very harsh environment to film decent action. Everything is seamless and there are genuinely creative sequences that left me in awe.The editing is great and the score is very cool. I love the movie's pacing, it never gets boring when there isn't a fight due to the interesting characters. Their dialogues are meaningful and the consequences of the destruction feel realistic. del Toro's world-building skills are phenomenal, he focused on creating a world where monsters and machines could exist without making it sound forced or stupid. He didn't worry about producing a franchise, he just tried to make a good standalone film and I think he even surprised himself with the final product.Nevertheless, it does have its flaws. While the main characters are remarkable, there are a couple of secondary characters who are extremely annoying. One is always screaming instead of just talking while the other is an exaggerated version of a stereotypical British person. They are even more frustrating because they are linked to an important part of the plot, hence a bigger chunk of screentime with these two. It breaks the tone since we quickly change from a serious moment to a cartoon comedy.Even though it doesn't feel slow at all, there is a gap between the first fight and the second one that I think is too long. An action-packed 20min go to 40min with pretty much no action whatsoever. Finally, del Toro uses an excess of exposition. The first act is full of narration and everything is just thrown at us. I got to a point where I actually thought 'is this guy still narrating after 15min?'. All in all, I had a blast with Pacific Rim! It makes me think how Transformers would be like if they were directed by someone more competent. Guillermo del Toro makes the most of his nack for visually stunning action and his world-building skills are intact, as the well-written characters dive in a surprisingly interesting screenplay.",8,0,0,13 April 2018
Ant-Man," Rating: B
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Casting and characters. These are two things that Marvel never does wrong. Every character in the MCU is somehow perfectly portrayed by their respective actor or actress. I rarely (not to say never) look at a performance from this franchise and think 'maybe he/she was not the right person for this role.' Once again, they nailed the casting and the character's scripts.Paul Rudd is terrific as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. He is astonishingly charismatic and puts a lot of his humorous expressions into his display. Lang is a highly captivating character with a compelling past which causes him to struggle in the present. People judge him by something he did and not by why he did it. He keeps fighting that unfair discrimination back, but injustice seems to prevail. The writers do a wonderful job of making the audience care for him without it feeling forced. Phenomenal work on creating a new superhero with a great backstory and heartfelt motivations.Two other exceptional castings are Evangeline Lilly as Hope and Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym. Both share an emotional attachment, and they are connected to the most interesting and touching subplot of the entire film. For a generic origin movie, having such a remarkable yet predictable side-story is a plus since it helps the film's flow by providing more enjoyable scenes.Hope is an outstanding character, and Lilly grants her this badass personality which I honestly love. She can get herself deep into her role and seamlessly impersonate Hope's feelings, delivering some really emotional moments. Michael Douglas is a legend, and he proves that he still has a lot to give. Excellent portrayal of Hank and fabulous chemistry with Lilly and Rudd. Michael Peña is also very funny as Luis, and he is the main source of the trademark Marvel comedy, spread throughout the movie.The action is undeniably unique. Watching what would be a regular action sequence in a small-scale is awkwardly exciting, fun and extremely entertaining. I love how Peyton Reed approaches these sequences as well as Ant-Man's training. The CGI is top-notch, and the fights choreography is pretty good. I have to praise the editing of these set pieces because it definitely improves them by transmitting to the spectator a comprehensive view of what is happening.I don't really have what I usually call flaws. I mean, this is an origin film, so I was not expecting a masterpiece. I never do with this sort of movies. The goal of these films is to introduce a new superhero to the MCU and do it right. Do it in a way that the audience can understand where the protagonist is coming from, what are his motivations and naturally create an interesting and entertaining story that can supplement that character development. As far as origin movies go, this is yet another success for Marvel.The only thing I might complain about is the villain. Corey Stoll is fine but his character, Darren Cross, is just another guy who wants to make money out of potentially dangerous equipment. There is an intriguing part of his past that he shares with Hank and I wish they could have explored that a bit more. It would have surely given a whole other layer to an otherwise cliche villain.Besides that, everything is at least good. The screenplay is good. It is nothing mind-blowing or ground-breaking, it is just a generic superhero origin story, but Reed makes good use of it. The comedy is good. It delivers some chuckles, but it does not leave me laughing like crazy. Even the action, while it is undoubtedly unparalleled, is a hair above good. It is not absolutely awesome like Winter Soldier or Civil War. It is a good origin film, that is it.Ant-Man is another successful MCU's superhero origin movie. Once again, the casting is perfect. I can't see anyone else portraying Scott Lang besides the hilarious Paul Rudd. I feel the same way with Evangeline Lilly as Hope. Both deliver some excellent performances, as well as Michael Douglas. The original action set pieces reduced to an ant-scale, are super fun and exciting. It is a good origin film, and that is it. No mind-blowing story, no incredible villain, no jaw-dropping action, no epic score. It is just good, and I had the right amount of fun watching it. Primary mission accomplished: fantastic casting for a significantly developed superhero and his future sidekick.",7,0,0,15 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I didn't know anything about how this movie was performing in the box office or how critics were receiving it. I was blown away with the number of mixed reviews because I genuinely didn't expect so many divisive opinions. This is one of the best films of the year, even if I do have a couple of issues with it, but apparently, a lot of people can't even positively review it, giving it terrible reputation.So, where can I start? Let's go with Rami Malek. Everyone knows an Oscar nomination is coming, but right now, he's the top contender to win the award, maybe tied with Bradley Cooper. If you watch Mr. Robot, you know the ability Rami has to turn himself into a completely different person, incorporating his character's personality like very few other actors can do.From the surprising physical similarity with Freddie Mercury to every tiny little detail of how he moved, talked or sang, Rami nails his role. His presence on stage extraordinarily resembles Freddie's, and his attitude is incredibly alike. As expected, he carries the entire movie on his shoulders, but he does receive help from an amazing cast, who provide undeniable chemistry which delivered some great moments.Gwilym Lee (Brian May), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) complete the band and Queen are born. The interactions between the four members are priceless and extremely entertaining. From the funny banter to the most emotional and dramatic scenes, Bryan Singer does a great job directing the actors on what and how they should do certain bits.The most common negative that a lot of critics are pointing out is the fact that the film doesn't delve deep into Freddie's personal life. Honestly, those reviews seem so out-of-place that they remembered me of the First Man's issue with not showing the American flag on the Moon. These two themes have nothing to do with the purpose of each movie's story. Bohemian Rhapsody is a musical biopic of one of the biggest bands of all-time.Obviously, it's always going to address its lead singer's life. Every film needs a protagonist. With that in mind, I think Anthony McCarten's screenplay is very well-balanced. It doesn't go in-depth with Freddie's issues with the last years of his life, and that was definitely a good call. His memory has to be respected and honored, not trashed by a movie who wanted to make him look like a male prostitute.Actually, that is one of my minor problems with the film. In the third act, too much time is wasted with Freddie's life and him dealing with his own sexuality, drugs and everything else. A part of it should have been cut and its time given to develop the band's backstory, and continue with one of the movie's best attributes: the songs' lyrics. Learning why and how the lyrics for so many famous songs came together is a blessing and something I won't ever forget. I was already a Queen's fan (who isn't?!), but now I'm even more.So, story and genre-wise, I think Bryan Singer was able to produce a success. I wasn't bothered by some less positive points in the screenplay, and as a musical biopic, I love it. They took Queen's music and used it as a fantastic soundtrack. One that creates so many epic and memorable moments that I can't wait to watch again at home. Every major song is powerfully delivered, whether by a stage performance (sadly, the lip-sync could be a lot better) or in a recording studio.The build-up for one of the biggest shows of all-time (if not, THE one) is remarkably well-executed and those final 15-20 minutes of the film are chill-inducing. I felt like crying, but my excitement and enthusiasm was so much that I just couldn't. Like I wrote above, the lip-sync didn't always work throughout the movie, but in this last concert, it was seamless. Visually and sound-wise, it's one of the most impactful musical moments of cinema of the last few years.I just wish they allocated more time to the remaining members of the band and to the group itself. Freddie Mercury is the front and center of the story, but Queen has to surpass that. Technically, I can't seem to find any missteps. Tonally well-balanced, the pacing is adequate, and the sound editing and mixing are exceptional. Watched this film on Dolby Atmos for the first time and I didn't regret it!All in all, Bohemian Rhapsody is a beautiful musical biopic of one of the biggest bands of all-time and its unbelievable lead singer. Rami Malek books himself an Oscar ticket and maybe even a golden statue due to its perfect representation of Freddie Mercury. With a great chemistry, the cast delivers a lot of entertaining moments, both musically and dramatically. Brilliant use of an incredible soundtrack which culminates on an epic reenactment of the famous 1985's show. Just wished that more time would have been given to the rest of the band and the band itself, plus some better filmed lip-sync. Minor issues that don't overwhelm (not by a long shot) a well-written story and an excellent direction from Bryan Singer. Go see it and enjoy!",8,2,3,6 November 2018
Watchmen," Rating: B
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, this review is based on the theatrical version of Watchmen. Usually, Director's Cuts or Ultimate Editions are not preferred over the original release. Few films benefit from them, and most are simply an extended cut with a bunch of deleted scenes. It's only fair and rational that a reviewer watches the version which the whole world saw at the theaters at the respective time. With that said, despite knowing the story of the source material, I never indeed read it. Having in mind that most of the 'hate' that this Zack Snyder's movie received is from comic-book purists (basically, every book/comic/game/whatever-lover who defends that any cinematic adaptations of any of these sources MUST be 100% the same, with no modifications whatsoever), I'm certain an unbiased perspective is the way to go.And overall, this is a good feature. Watchmen isn't just another CBM (comic-book movie). It doesn't just follow one hero vs. one villain. It's a whole world (in today's standards, it's really a cinematic universe) of 'superheroes' meant to be explored in fine detail (hence the release of a TV show today... reviewing that later). It's an extremely complex world that needs to be thoroughly explained in order to deeply understand how it works, and what's everyone's role in it. This is the film's main problem: it struggles to juggle all of its different storylines and distinct characters. Even with 163min of runtime, it's impossible to squeeze in all of the necessary information.So, as expected, Snyder and his team of screenwriters had to simplify, shorten, or even wholly dismiss some story elements that would only stretch the runtime to an unfathomable length. Some of the adaptations work brilliantly, but some fail to give a character its importance or offer no interest to a subplot. However, it's still easy to understand everything, and how the ending is going to unravel, which leads me to my second issue with the movie: its final act's heavy exposition.Like I wrote above, there is a lot of information to deliver. What Snyder did very well was to tell most of it through flashbacks or captivating conversations, but in the final act, where everything was self-explanatory and in no need of more exposition, there is an excess of redundant dialogue that doesn't really add anything relevant. What the characters are saying is significant, yes, but we, as the audience, already know all of that way before the film's climax. It's ironic how they make a joke about villains telling their masterplan to the hero and how this villain isn't dumb enough to do it, but then proceed to carefully explain everything (that we know already) through exposition.Sincerely, these are the major problems that I have with the movie. However, I love so much about everything else. From the appropriated and fun soundtracks to the beautiful production design, Zack Snyder and his crew really do a fantastic work technically. Snyder's style captures Watchmen's world perfectly. It's one of those films that carry a 'feel' due to its stylish cinematography. I love how little CGI is actually applied (I'm obviously ignoring the big blue guy), and the abundance of practical effects and real sets that are used. The action sequences look spectacular, way better than a lot of blockbusters nowadays (10 years later!).Despite the terrific technical achievements, my main compliment is actually connected to my number one problem. Even though the storylines are incredibly hard to balance, characters like Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) have extraordinarily captivating and entertaining stories. There might be a few missteps here and there, but Snyder made ONE movie from a material that's worth a whole TV show or at least two films. And he delivered a GOOD one! Probably a better job than 80% of the directors working today could ever achieve. Finally, the social commentary is still quite relevant for this new generation, and if the so-called 'source-material-purists' didn't exist, this movie would be a lot more appreciated.All in all, Watchmen is as good as it could be, having in mind it's just one film with already a long runtime. Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws.",7,1,3,28 October 2019
Baby Driver," Rating: A
","In my opinion, a movie's score is one of the five most important details of its success. It doesn't matter if it's a musical, a drama or a horror film, its soundtrack must be epic and memorable so that it triumphs in the big scenes.Baby Driver has THAT score! Without it, this movie wouldn't be as awesome as it is and it wouldn't definitely be part of my favorite films of 2017! The soundtrack is part of the story, it adds more depth to the dialogue scenes, it helps developing characters and it elevates the action sequences making them feel much more fun and entertaining. It's a perfect score to an amazing movie.As expected in an action film with pretty much only car chases, the direction skills used are always my biggest concern: am I going to be able to actually follow the action sequences? Or is it going to be full of cuts and cars with no route whatsoever which will make it all extremely confusing and disorienting? Well,Â Edgar Wright nails the chasing scenes and adds some more cool shootouts and bank heists!They are riveting, captivating, extremely fun and edited flawlessly. There's very little CGI in the chasing sequences and some long takes help to fluidly follow the cars without it becoming a mess in my head. I always know where they are, where they're going and what they're doing. The phenomenal editing is consistent throughout the movie and the cinematography is just beautiful. Excellent camera work with incredibly long one-takes (one of the opening scenes is a complete masterpiece) prove thatÂ Edgar Wright is one of the best directors working today!The cast also plays a huge role.Â Ansel Elgort, who I didn't know that well, has a great performance even if it is very subtle. It's not a 'full-on' performance with tons of scenes where he shines, but he definitely brings the attention all to himself due to his well- portrayedÂ character's personality.Â Kevin Spacey is a legend! He just does what he always does: be himself. He doesn't even act, he just goes through the dialogue so fascinatingly fast, but in a way that keeps us very captivated and mindful. His character has some slight depth that he elevates brilliantly alongside his usual burst of charisma.As for the rest of the cast, everyone is really great, but I have to take my hat off toÂ Lily James (Deborah), who is able to be romantic as well as dramatic without ever feeling over-the-top or even clichÃ©. Her chemistry with Ansel is amazing and the dialogue scenes become very captivating at the sound of some perfect music.Â The romance is one of the things that some people might find boring, 'more of the same' or just unnecessary (this last one is nonsense), but the actors/characters are so interesting and compelling that they are able to raise the quality of a potential flaw, one that I find pretty great.Jon Hamm (Buddy) is a surprise and pulls off a great performance as well asÂ Jamie Foxx (Bats) who portrays a badass in a cool way. The cast's chemistry is palpable and everyone seems to be having fun with the shooting instead of being there just to collect their paycheck.Baby is the main character so his backstory and present situation is very well developed, but I'm happy that the writers didn't forget the supporting characters. Everyone receives something that makes me care for them, at least enough for me to be at the edge of my seat during the action scenes. The writing is extremely well-balanced, it never transforms the film into just a comedy (due to the fantastic humor) or just a drama (due to the dialogue/character development scenes). It's just right on point.My only issue with this movie are some moments during the second act. Despite the film's fast pacing, the main story isn't anything new or unique, it pretty much follows the path that I am expecting from the beginning. Because of that, the second act drags a little bit during some scenes that aren't that interesting and that don't have that much depth or significance to them.All in all,Â Baby Driver is one of my favorite movies of this year! Exciting action/chasing sequences, a brilliant direction fromÂ Edgar Wright (from the beautiful cinematography to the extremely well- handled camera work and flawless editing), some captivating and compelling characters, a cast with terrific chemistry and withÂ Ansel Elgort surprisingly stepping up to the plate. The writing's on point and the soundtrack is the film's main attribute: without it, everything else loses both depth and awesomeness. It's just memorable. Some pacing issues during the second act don't let me give it the maximum rating, but it's still a simply fantastic, fun and super entertaining movie!",9,5,10,15 August 2017
Justice League," Rating: B
","So, does this new DC Comics' installment win a place among the best comic-book movies ever? No, not even close. However, it does reach the expectations I had and it even surpasses them in some aspects. It is a good film but it is not great.Then, what does work? Undoubtedly, the cast is the standout of the whole show. The league's chemistry is palpable and genuinely entertaining, which definitely elevates every single character. I love that all of them are lighthearted and humorous, instead of being overdramatic, dark and depressing.Ben Affleck continues to be a true badass as Batman / Bruce Wayne. I was always a fan of his work, but when the news of him being cast as one of the most popular superheroes of all-time were released, I was part of the people that doubted that choice. However, I was the first to admit that I was wrong when BvS came out and he was one of the few positives of the entire movie. Once again, he delivers a fantastic performance and Batman has some awesome scenes, as always.Gal Gadot as Diana Price / Wonder Woman might be my favorite casting choice of these last few years. It is mind-blowing how one actress can dignify a single character so damn much. Her dedicated and heartfelt display completely astounds me and she is able to turn Wonder Woman into one of my favorite superheroes of today. Even if her lines are sometimes cheesy and shallow, Gadot deals with it in a flawless fashion.Ezra Miller is probably going to be the audience's preference due to his witty moments as Barry Allen / The Flash. He definitely captures the character's spirit, The Flash has the funniest lines and his sequences are really well shot. Jason Momoa is freaking awesome as Arthur Curry / Aquaman and his action scenes are even more badass. Finally, Ray Fisher is great as Victor Stone / Cyborg, the most intriguing character of the film, even though he is 95% CGI.Yet, this is where problems start to rise. I didn't write much about these last three characters because there are quite few development scenes. The set-ups for each of these superheroes are so swift and insignificant that I can't really care for any of them. What is supposed to be an origin movie for each one, that is simplified in one or two lines, especially with The Flash.There is a reason why The Avengers is, still to this day, one of the best comic-book movies ever created. Marvel spent 5 years setting up and developing each of their main heroes, so when the time arrived to unite them, every fan knew who each superhero was and most importantly, everyone was already connected with them. Still, even with all of this preparation, the runtime for this huge blockbuster is 142 minutes.Justice League is only 110 minutes long and it needs to set up 3 new characters, a villain and a whole story where they all need to come together as a team. Obviously, something is going to go wrong and that is almost everything plot-related. The pacing and tone are out of control, some of the editing feels uncommonly choppy and the script for each character sometimes falls in the 'silly' territory.In case you don't know about this, Snyder had to step down from the production due to family-related issues, so Joss Whedon replaced him for a while. It still feels very much like a Snyder film, but with all of the re-shoots, some scenes feel like a different film or they don't seem to have a connection to the prior moments (Whedon unquestionably removed and added some stuff).With the unbalanced pacing and some messy plot points (isolated scenes), the movie's overall flow breaks and it is brought down. These are some of the reasons behind the choppy editing, so I look forward to an extended edition because I truly think they can improve both the story (more time for character development) and the technical details (natural flow between scenes).Similarly to pretty much almost every superhero film, my main issue with the movie is, as you presumably guessed by now, the villain. Steppenwolf is just a giant CGI beast that wants to conquer the world because 'darkness, yeah'. He is as dull and fake as it could be. There is absolutely no attempt at developing him, he is simply a plot device to cause our heroes to assemble and fight him together. Awful. Just horrible.Despite all of these flaws, Justice League also has a lot of positives and there is no denying it. It is a much more entertaining and cheerful film than its predecessors, so there are more than reasons for everyone to spend a good time at the theater. The action set pieces are phenomenal, the third act might be heavy on CGI, but it is extremely well managed and it doesn't feel video game-ish as in WW.The score is pretty neat and it conducts the action excellently. The ending is near perfect, in my opinion. For the first time, I can finally say that Superman is awesome! They finally got the character right, he is the untarnished standout of the third act with some epic moments spread by astonishing fighting scenes. And yes, Henri Cavill is exceptional, even though his digitally-removed mustache doesn't escape anyone's eyes.To summarise, Justice League is clearly a step in the right direction. It has a lot of technical issues with its pacing, tone and screenplay that mess up the movie's overall flow and editing, but the big problem is undoubtedly the lack of depth in the new characters, villain included. Nevertheless, the cast's chemistry is as entertaining and funny as the characters they portray, being Gadot, Affleck and Miller the standouts, while Superman steals the show in the end. Some fantastic action sequences, a cool soundtrack and an incredibly satisfying ending (plus two awesome post-credits scenes) prove that DCEU just started to roll up its sleeves!<ul><li>MSB Reviews - if you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",7,1,3,19 November 2017
Split," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)James McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the 'crazy' man.Is this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?Once again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).The production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.As for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!Anya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.As for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don't have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.In the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!MAJOR SPOILER BELOWAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.This is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.Both movies end up falling into the 'superhero' genre. Unbreakable is the story of our 'hero' who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing 'what he was supposed to do', and Split is an origin story of our 'villain'. If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best 'superhero' trilogies ever.",9,27,44,6 August 2017
The Shining," Rating: A+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)With Doctor Sleep, an almost 40-year sequel to The Shining, being released this week, now it's the perfect time to revisit one of the greatest horror movies of all-time, as well as one of the most influential directors ever, Stanley Kubrick. I know, I know... Spoiler-free? For a movie released in 1980? Well, first of all, there's always someone who still didn't watch it. Secondly, as deeper we get into the 21st century, the more the 60s/70s/80s/90s movies are forgotten. And finally, if there's a movie which I don't need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is, it's The Shining. With that said ...It has always been one of my favorite horror films ever. It's not perfect (no film is) and some aspects don't work as well now as they did 5/10/20 years ago. When it came out, Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel was received with mixed reactions. King himself criticized the movie. However, less than 10 years later, Kubrick's film was already being reevaluated. Nowadays, it's considered a cult classic, and it's easy to understand why. From the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies, The Shining has some of the most memorable lines ever. Just this year, we had It: Chapter Two mimicking Jack Nicholson's 'Here's Johnny!' scene, for example. And then there's the mysterious 'redrum'...However, the movie's biggest influence is its technical achievements. I apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical, but it's impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film. This movie was one of the first to use Steadicam (a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots, even on irregular surfaces, isolating the operator's movement), something that became so common that people don't even praise anymore. Honestly, there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work, so I'm one of those who defend that the Steadicam use shouldn't be taken for granted. Especially how Kubrick did, barely above the floor, which originated the extension 'low-mode' that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist.With the innovative use of the technical equipment, Kubrick's delivers a masterclass in framing (composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view). So much that it became worthy of studying. Almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme. If you ever feel bored during your viewing, then you're (probably) not 'watching it right'. You're not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters. This isn't a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you. It's heavy on visual storytelling, so if you don't pay attention, you're going to reach the film's climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something.From the mise-en-scene (arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, hence this French term that means 'placing on stage') having several blood-red colors to the wide shots clearly showing 'exit' signs and giving the maze-vibe of the enormous hotel, the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie. The symmetry/mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy. From the hotel's structure and decoration (everything is incredibly symmetric) to the growing use of mirrors (these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness), Kubrick's framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads, still to this date.You'll always find something new on another viewing. It might be from 1980, but it's a movie that requires your full attention. Don't underestimate films from the 20th century like you can't be surprised by a film 'that old' (you'll be dumbfounded by dozens). If John Alcott's cinematography is impressive, then what can I write about Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind's haunting score? Nowadays, scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments. However, throughout the film and during dialogues, even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes, and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent.In The Shining, the score is part of the conversation. If a character feels fear or danger is imminent, a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment. If two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive, the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness. It's a perfect horror film's score. Technically, I'll stop there because no words will be able to express how mind-blowing Kubrick's visionary methods are. He's one of the greatest directors ever, maybe even the most influential. Hopefully, his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant.Story-wise, The Shining also inspired a whole new generation. Everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film, but it's the clever exposition that satisfies me. Every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues/actions. I watched the 144min version of the film (the European version has 25min less than the American version, and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by Kubrick himself), and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something. It can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point, but every single sequence has a particular purpose.Jack Nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance, one of his career's best. His script might be very well-written, but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing. He carries one-take, extense dialogues seamlessly. Credit to Kubrick for making a movie with at least 2/3-minute takes, sure, but Nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one. Danny Lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever. His voice as Tony is a great accomplishment, and he seems to understand his surroundings, in a way that I never felt like I needed to 'go easy' on him because he's just impeccable.Shelley Duvall, however, is a mixed bag for me. Over-the-top displays were better received at the time, but almost 40 years later, her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times. She's an amazing counterpart for Nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues, but when she's alone or in an emotionally troubled moment, she's too much to handle. Scatman Crothers doesn't have that much screentime as Dick Halloran, but he shines every time he has to deliver a line. Some people complain about the slow pacing, but I love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension. While the ending might be just a tad abrupt, the final image of the film stays with us forever, and after all this time, I still didn't settle on my own theory.All in all, The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all-time. Stanley Kubrick's masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident, so even if you don't study the art of filmmaking, it's clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story. In addition to his framing, his use of the innovative Steadicam and his notable mise-en-scene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work. Besides the impressive technical achievements, Jack Nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years, and new theories keep coming up. While I'll keep trying to settle on my own interpretation, don't you dare spend the rest of your life without (re)watching this cult classic.",10,1,4,30 October 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Christopher McQuarrie is able to create a film with the best qualities of its predecessors. The high levels of tension and suspense of M:I-1 and the non-stop action of M:I-3 are very well-balanced in Rogue Nation, which makes it another success inside an already fantastic saga. The action continues to be the highlight since Tom Cruise's mission apparently is to try and perform as many death-or-life situations as he can.The plane sequence is riveting, the underwater set piece is (literally) breathtaking and the chasing scenes, whether on foot or by car or by a motorcycle, are incredibly exciting. McQuarrie directs the hell out of those scenes with an unique camera work, some beautiful cinematography, and seamless editing. The score is once again brilliant and it helps giving me some goosebumps.The screenplay is captivating and it finally has another decent villain to rival with Philip Seymour Hoffman of the third installment. Sean Harris portrays Solomon Lane and, even though Lane isn't exactly an extremely well-written antagonist, at least he has clear motivations and a lot more screentime than other villains throughout the series. Still, he could have been better explored.The new additions to the cast are sensational. Rebecca Ferguson brilliantly interprets Ilsa Faust, who has some great development along the runtime. Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) is also a great addition to the saga. I love that they decided to use Ving Rhames' character, Luther, more in this movie. He only had a tiny bit at the end of Ghost Protocol, so I am delighted to see him back on screen with his fantastic humor. Simon Pegg (Benji) is also becoming one of my favorite characters and Pegg proves that he can also accomplish some great dramatic scenes besides the frequent comic relief moments.Finally, Jeremy Renner (William Brandt) continues to be an awesome actor by portraying a possible substitute of Ethan Hunt in the future of the franchise (even if I doubt that Renner would do all the crazy stuff Cruise does). Obviously, Tom Cruise is the standout with all of his jaw-dropping real stunts that most people don't even believe they are actually true. I bet that at least 7 out of 10 people that watched this movie at the time of its release, didn't believe for a single moment that the airplane scene was real ... This is saying a lot about the quality of the stunt team and the unbelievable courage of Cruise. Please, never stop doing this!My only big issue with the movie is its pacing. Even though it gives more time for the audience to rest between action sequences, it becomes too much espionage exposition and it slightly becomes a bit boring. The tone is well-balanced, but the pacing really does not help at all the overall flow of the film. This aspect plus the not-that-great villain bring the movie a bit down for me but it is still right among the best in the franchise.All in all, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation provides the entertainment that the audience expects from it. Tom Cruise proves once again why he is an icon in action movie history with mind-blowing stunts and McQuarrie is able to elevate the levels of tension and suspense in the already fantastic action set pieces. Beautiful-looking and with a perfect score, a captivating story and a brilliant cast, filled with compelling characters. Definitely, one of the best of the saga.",8,0,0,6 August 2018
Dunkirk," Rating: A
","Some things are undeniable: the sky is blue, fire burns and Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors alive. His originality in the way he tells a story is always mind-blowing and very unconventional, which makes some critics' minds go against him simply because they just can't understand the brilliance of said director.Once again, Nolan directs the hell out of this movie! Not only his storytelling is very different, it actually fits perfectly into the film's line of events. Once you get it, it literally makes you go 'Oooooohhhhh, so that's what you wanted me to understand. Cool!'. The fact that he used 6000 extras plus real boats and planes from that era elevates the movie's realism. The real locations make the whole film look stunning and the cinematography is pure perfection.As for the story itself, I gotta emphasize on this: it's literally a WAR movie. From the very first shot, BUM! You're in it! This might be one of the best (if not THE best) pure war film in history: the dizzy air fights, the bombs constantly being dropped on the beach, the gunshots, everything feels and SOUNDS so real! Hans Zimmer's score proves that he's one of the best composers ever ...For the first time in my life, I honestly felt sick and uncomfortable watching some scenes on IMAX. Normally, this would be a negative, but not on a war film like this: it delivers the message it wants in the most REAL way possible. If I didn't feel well, seated on a chair, watching a war going down on a screen, I can't even imagine what it's like to actually experience it.The cast is great, especially Mark Rylance as Mr. Dawson who brings a needed level of emotion to the movie, Fionn Whitehead as Tommy who we follow throughout the major part of the runtime and also Harry Styles as Alex who surprised the hell out of me, the kid can actually act!Like I said above, this is a very unconventional film which portrays the war in its most horrible and fierce state. There's almost no dialogue during the whole runtime, there's no chat around a fire where the soldiers talk about their pasts and families, there's never a moment to rest. That, for me, it's perfect because it depicts the war as it probably was! I can't imagine people having dances and chats on the beach while bombs are being dropped, so this aspect of the film, for me, it's as real as it can get.However, this leads me to my only issue with this movie: its characters. Since there's no backstory to any of them, I can't really connect or get attached to a single character. I understand that that's exactly what Nolan wanted, but the truth is that I didn't feel scared for someone's imminent death or worried that someone might not make it to the rescue boats ... God, I needed to go to RottenTomatoes to check some of the characters' names because I couldn't remember them! They are nothing to me because I know nothing about them ...Still, I can only see this as a minor issue for me because I can understand what Nolan was going for, I truly can. Dunkirk is about the EVENT and not the people in it.The whole movie gives me that sense of danger and urgency with the thrilling air fights, with the soldiers' fear in their faces every time a plane goes by, as well as their hope every time they go away. The worry and sense of duty that the sailors show navigating into the war to save their fellow compatriots is emotional and captivating ... Every single one of these aspects elevates the film in such a way that I can't look at it and not see a perfect portrayal of WAR.In conclusion, Nolan does it again. His unconventional storytelling and beautiful cinematography, as well as Hans Zimmer's score, turn Dunkirk into one of the best war movies of all time! From the dizzy air fights to the bombs being dropped, everything feels incredibly real and scary, which makes this film probably the best portrayal of a war in its most fierce state. The cast is great, the characters not so much, but the story is about the event that happened and not about the people in it. So, go and (try to) enjoy a war through a screen without throwing up or leaving your seat: after all, you are safe ... They were not.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,6,13,6 August 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Rating: A
","The Captain America series is, by far, my favorite: the first movie did really well in introducing this new hero and Captain America: Winter Soldier is considered by many the best Marvel movie so far because of its realism and a more serious path that they took this character into. This film follows that path, but this time, it brings ALL of the superheroes down to Earth and makes them feel responsible for what they've done.I was concerned with the fact that they had so many characters because they needed to give reason to all of them to choose a side and I wasn't sure that they would be able to do it well ... However, they did! I was surprised with how serious, realistic and mature this movie was (along with all the usual moments of comedy we're used to). There was time for each character to have their own reasons to join either Captain America / Steve Rogers's team or Iron Man / Tony Stark's team and that made the movie so much more grounded, with real life consequences. It was a movie way beyond that ass-kicking fight scenes that most people remember and care about, it had real emotions and purpose, with all the friendship's colliding and a revenge path that didn't go well.Now, this film is not perfect, there are minor issues here and there, but no one, anyone, can criticize the action present in this movie. The stunt team did a perfect, awesome job! There were some amazing choreographed fight scenes, most of it in-camera with no CGI, there were a lot of chase scenes and one-on-one combats that felt so incredibly real. Of course, they used CGI on explosions and all that stuff, but they really improved all of the stunt work done in previous films.So, I have to talk about some actors and their characters: Tom Holland as Spider-Man / Peter Parker was my main worry after what I saw in that last trailer ... But Jesus, he was great! This is probably the best Spider-Man I've ever seen, the writing for him was perfect and the place where he came from was so humbly real and well-adjusted to this character. Chadwich Boseman as Black Panther / T'Challa was bad-ass, I loved every scene he was in! Again, the directors gave him enough time for us to understand his motives and to why did he choose a side to fight for. After they tell his backstory, I was totally on his side, as I was for every single character!The reason why that big airport battle was so awesome is because I cared for everyone that was there and that made every combat so entertaining to watch. Everyone, even the villain, had his own motivations and the film was so clear to demonstrate that, no one was there just because they needed to be since this was a big superhero clash. Also, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man / Scott Lang proved once again that he's pure awesomeness. Just saying.This film handled the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man so well on all levels (physical, mental, political) that, at the beginning of the fight, I couldn't choose a side. All of that #TeamCap and #TeamIronMan campaign was just marketing because when you actually see the movie, you are behind every superhero's cause because you understand their motivations.The ending didn't go as I wanted to, but I can't fault the movie for it, at least not yet. Also, Daniel Bruhl as Zemo could have done a lot better. It seemed he was there just to help the movie get from here to there and he wasn't very interesting, he even got boring at one point. The first 20/30 minutes are also very different from the rest of the film, the editing was not that great in major action scenes and it did bother me a little.Still, I really think that the Captain America series is the best from Marvel so far. It's the only one where each movie got better than the last one and I can't say the same for the other series (Thor, Iron Man, The Avengers ...).<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,1,3,6 August 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Rating: B
","I was never a hardcore fan of the Harry Potter's movies, but I did enjoy all of them, especially the last ones, so I was excited enough to get out and watch it in theaters. I have to say this right off the bat: you don't need to have seen the previous adventures of Harry Potter and his friends to watch this movie and that's something to praise!Every single prequel, sequel or spin-off always have some sort of bond to the first movie(s), but not Fantastic Beasts. They actually made an effort to achieve a good film without depending on the other famous story and heroes, this is a new start for a new (I hope, amazing) adventure with new characters, new spells, different places, rules and names (humans that were called Muggles are now called NoMag, for example).As for the story and characters, everything's just great. Eddie Redmayne does an excellent job portraying a caring, loving and vulnerable character like Newt. He's very likable and he's able to hide his past without it being too cheesy or lame. Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski is another perfect casting, he's hilarious and he basically plays us, an audience member. He doesn't know what's happening, he needs explanations about everything and everyone which doesn't really help the movie since there's a lot of exposition scenes, even if they're understandable for a movie that needs to set up a new world (like I said, it has almost nothing to do with the other one). Still, he was the reason behind the biggest emotional moment of the whole film and he's, for sure, the audience's favorite character.Another great surprise was the portrait of Tina (an investigator who's trying to figure out the mess that's going on in the city) by Katherine Waterston, she was able to capture that needed emotion on the right moments and was also a very likable character. Colin Farrell as Percival Graves was amazing, even if he doesn't appear that much. He was still connected to the biggest (but obvious) twist of the film.David Yates does a fantastic job as the director, he clearly understands this magic world like no one else and I hope he stays for the rest of the franchise. However, his editing team doesn't seem to be on the same page in terms of quality. There's a ton of CGI and editing mistakes and some cuts aren't that fluid. Another issue with this movie is the pacing: there's a lot of needed and cool character building moments, but there's also a lot of scenes that are just ... there. Every scene with the creatures is so exciting that, when we're not watching someone trying to capture one of them, the level of interest decreases a lot.There are some good twists throughout the film, but there's a lot of narrative issues like the ones I mentioned above. Heavy exposition scenes with Jacob, a lot of entertaining scenes that don't have any purpose for the story and all of this combined gives birth to a somewhat slow pacing. The villain is not something I really bought into it, but I guess I'll just have to wait for the next movies.In the end, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an enjoyable film, it's a showcase of the magic and creatures of this new world, it sets up a whole new franchise, but it's still a good movie (learn a little bit with this DC Comics). Great characters, excellent performances with perfect writing and a nice story to introduce us everything that's new. Some editing flaws plus a lot of exposition scenes and a pacing sometimes off brings the movie down, but still to an entertaining level.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",7,1,1,6 August 2017
The Favourite," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The Favourite is one of the most acclaimed movies of last year, receiving multiple nominations at dozens of awards shows and winning a whole bunch of them (2nd most awarded film of 2018, behind Roma). Being a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos' style, I couldn't be happier for him, and I was now even more excited to watch what he produced and directed. This movie is a classic example of an Oscars' tradition of sorts. A lot of audience members make their mission to watch every Best Picture nominee before the big night, and there's always one film that people fail to grasp on why did it get so much praise? Why are critics all around the world absolutely loving what audiences perceive as an 'okay' time at the theater, but which contains a long, weird and maybe even dull (for some) story?Well, first of all, this is technically a masterpiece. I mean, every single technical aspect is worthy of recognition. The production and set design are gorgeously eyegasmic. The score is unusual for a period piece like this, but it weirdly works, as it continuously elevates the tension between the three main characters and helps the story flow with an always conspicuous, treacherous feeling. Even the cinematography and the plays with candlelight offer some pretty neat scenes. However, and prepare to be surprised, the costume design steals the show from all the other achievements. This is coming from a guy who has utterly no interest in this particular matter and who rarely talks about it, so I'm as surprised as you are.It's not due to the costumes being pretty or appropriate to the time period. Almost every movie that tackles these times nail the costume design, but only a few can tell a character arc through it. Even less are capable of embodying the whole screenplay like this Oscar-bait does. Our protagonists have distinct journeys, but their ends all have similarities. One way of understanding the story is through what they wear, which seamlessly represent the arc that each character takes to get where they eventually end up. These layers of storytelling keep the film intriguing, but Lanthimos' uncommon methods plus McNamara and Davis' script will displease some audience members.The Favourite is that movie that audiences are going to be perplexed about why do critics adore it. There's no secret, really. Audience members don't care about the technical part of films. They couldn't care less about costume design, cinematography, score or how the screenplay is written. They want to be entertained and have a good time at the theater, so I find reasonable if people leave a bit disappointed with one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2018. Lanthimos doesn't deliver formulaic stories, and he certainly doesn't film them in a regular fashion, so I firmly believe the general public isn't really going to enjoy this one. His unique style brings a very different tone, pace and filming techniques that people aren't used to experiencing. Fortunately, there's more than just technical attributes to this film. Three magnificent and powerful performances from Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, carry the whole thing to safe harbor.These three actresses deserve every single nomination they got so far. Colman delivers both a hilarious and emotionally heavy display, as Anne. An incredibly fragile Queen with a shockingly traumatic past, whose love and affection is being fought for between Abigail and Sarah. Most of the laughs this movie gives are through Anne and her petty behavior towards her servants. Colman delivers her body and soul to her role, adding yet another fantastic performance to her splendid career. Weisz is just flawless. Sarah's arc is Abigail's opposite in almost every way, and Rachel is remarkably sharp. She doesn't really have a definite shining moment like Stone or Colman have, but it's a consistent and robust display from an actress who needed a return to the spotlight.Nevertheless, it's Emma Stone who shines through with an unbelievable range of emotions and expressions. Her performance in La La Land is great, but as Abigail she is outstanding! She handles her character's personality change with an impeccable transition regarding her acting and the only reason why she's probably not getting the Oscar win, is due to the campaign supporting Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk). Abigail is the character that moves the plot forward by trying to steal Sarah's place near the Queen. Her intelligent and manipulative moves are extremely captivating, as well as her will to gain Anne's love.Yorgos Lanthimos knows his craft and his weird yet unparalleled style is something that will surely deliver even more divisive and confusing films in the future. From the camera angles to his methods of storytelling, he's one hell of a director-writer-producer! Technically, The Favourite is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the last year. The impressive production and set design plus the addictive score definitely raise the film, but the costume design tells a whole story through what the characters dress during the whole runtime. The screenplay is remarkably-written, filled with complex dialogues and several twists and turns, which lead our characters through eventful arcs.Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz deliver compelling performances, but Emma Stone is in another level. Her range is mind-boggling, and she carries a big responsibility by portraying the character who changes the whole story. Nevertheless, the movie feels a bit too long, and the story drops its interest levels during the transition from the second to the third act. Basically, I'll put it like this: if you're just a regular audience member who only goes to the theater to eat popcorn while being entertained, The Favourite isn't going to make you eat your whole bucket; if you watch films through a more in-depth look, then you'll be as marveled as I was by the end of it.",8,2,4,8 February 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)After a massive decline in quality from M:I-1 to M:I-2, MI:-3 picked up the saga again. Is Ghost Protocol able to maintain or even improve the franchise high stakes?This is the best film of the franchise or, at least, right up there with the original. There are so many great things to write about this movie that I am going to start with my couple of issues since honestly, they are not that big of a deal, and I want to end my review with positive things to transmit.So, the villain ... Michael Nyqvist portrays Kurt Hendricks, and he is the worst antagonist of the whole saga. The actor is great, no problem there. The big issue is that Kurt is the depthless character in the Mission: Impossible series. He barely has screentime, so naturally, his motivations are null, and there is really nothing to him. He just wants to blow things up and start a war or something.My only other issue has to do with the action. No, not with the action itself but how it progressed along the runtime. The standout scenes are undoubtedly the shots in Dubai and in the Burj Khalifa building. These moments are midway through the film, so the action of the third act, the one that usually should blow our minds and have all of the tension and adrenaline, feels like a level below.However, and this is extremely important for you to understand: remember when I wrote that M:I-3 had the best action in the entire saga? Well, Ghost Protocol just surpassed it and in such a phenomenal way! What I wrote in the last paragraph is correct regarding the quality of the action declining towards the end, but bare in mind that I am writing about some of the best action stunts in movie history! The third act's action makes tons of other films jealous, I don't have any doubts about that.Still, the big adrenaline rush arrives at the one-hour mark. Everything, literally every single scene in Dubai, not only the fantastic Burj Khalifa stunts, are gold. Pure gold. This movie was released in 2011, and the real action displayed in it is unbelievable. I mean, if I was seeing this 7 years ago, the first thing I would do once I got home, was to google which stunts were real or not. Believe or not, a lot of them are. Especially the ones you think are not.Brad Bird has a great filmography concerning animated films, but this was his first live-action one. He is superb! The cinematography is jaw-droppingly beautiful, every shot is dripping with visual quality, and the score is riveting. However, he shines brightly when it comes to the screenplay. With the help of his writers, he is able to write a simple yet exciting plot, filled with suspenseful moments and high levels of excitement.The characters have never been better written, and the cast has never had such great performances. Jeremy Renner is terrific as Brandt, and his backstory provides a compelling and secret link to Hunt, which plays a very significant plot twist later on. Paula Patton is charming as Jane Carter, and once again this character is given an emotional motivation to accomplish the IMF's mission, which makes me care about her. Simon Pegg is humorous as Benji, who receives a much more prominent role to play in this movie. He somehow replaces Ving Rhames as the character who brings the bits of comedy and banter, which are always a breath of relief in such a fast-paced film.Finally, Tom Cruise is incredible as Ethan. I mean, he transcends to a whole other level. When you have an actor who does all his stunts, that's great. But when you have an actor who does all his stunts, being one of those stunts clinging to the side of the highest building on the planet ... That's just ridiculously outstanding! In my humble opinion, I think Cruise is the best action movie star of all-time. I mean, how can someone deny his commitment and courage?Before I finish, I will address the pacing. Even though it didn't bother me, a lot of people complained about the non-stop action of M:I-3 and I understand their point. However, the balance in M:I-4 is perfect. There is always some sort of transition to the next action sequences. Either the team is discussing the plan, or some character is getting time to be developed or something in between. There is never a dull moment, but the frenetic pacing is better controlled.All in all, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol is right up there with the original when it comes to the best film of the franchise. The action is mind-blowing and the best in the saga. The characters have never been better flushed out, the cast is fantastic (especially Tom Cruise, naturally) and the pacing is fast but controlled. Brad Bird directs the hell out of the movie, with beautiful wide shots and exceptional cinematography. An exciting yet simple plot is only injured by the worst villain of the series and by some nit-picky things from my part regarding the third act's action.",8,2,3,1 August 2018
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rating: B+
","This is a great start to another (and hopefully the last) reboot of a well-known franchise, Planet of the Apes. It's easy to say what definitely stands out: the visual effects. All of the CGI apes are incredibly realistic, especially Caesar (Andy Serkis) who is a terrific masterpiece, not only visually, but as a character as well. He's surprisingly the protagonist of the movie, a decision that I congratulate the director and production team for, because it transformed it into a much more captivating and interesting film.Andy Serkis is the God of motion capture, it's amazing the amount of emotion he's able to transmit as a guy in a spandex suit full of white dots on his face. Caesar is one of the most fantastic and intriguing characters I've ever watched and the fact that there's almost no dialogue throughout the film just proves that you can achieve great things with pure emotion (and some sign language ... ).James Franco is good portraying an also well-developed character, even if he wasn't as great as he could be. The script is very smart and emotional (mainly due to the extremely well-directed no-dialogue scenes) and the action is super awesome, particularly because of its emotional side. The fact that we actually care about the apes (maybe even more than the humans) elevates the action-heavy third act and brings the movie home (no pun intended), with a very strong ending.In spite of all this, it's still not a perfect film. Even if the runtime isn't properly long, the film's pacing (principally the second act) is really slow, which drags the movie into almost a boring state. As I said above, the story is captivating, but only when we're with Caesar and his respective families ... All of the human drama inside the Gen-Sys Laboratories isn't really interesting, but we still get too much of it.Finally, the side characters. Besides Caesar, Will and his father (brilliantly portrayed by John Lithgow), no one else got the chance to shine on the big screen. Most of them are plot devices in order to get the story going and actually have a film: the 'bad guys' are just bad because ... Well, they're assholes, I guess they were born that way ... I would have preferred that they spent a little more time with those characters instead of the company's dramas.All in all, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an excellent start to this reboot that proves we don't need dialogue to transmit a great amount of emotion. The CGI is flawless, Caesar being the huge proof of what a masterpiece looks like, visually and character-wise. A slow pace and some under-developed side characters bring the movie down a bit, but the captivating and emotional story, plus a very well-directed action-heavy third act, elevate the film into one of the best in the whole franchise.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",7,1,1,6 August 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)My most anticipated movie of 2018 was released a few months ago but at the time I was super busy, so I only had the opportunity to write a mini-review. Now, with Ant-Man and the Wasp coming out this week, I am writing full reviews of the 2015 Ant-Man as well as this monumental film, which features a lot of our favorite superheroes. I didn't watch a single clip or trailer for Infinity War, but my expectations were as high as ever. I went into the theater expecting to (finally) get a movie to rival with The Dark Knight for the best superhero film of all-time ...Unfortunately, I didn't get it. I will get my two issues out of the way now so I can focus on the positives because this movie has a lot of them. Being this a spoiler-free review, I can't get in-depth about its ending, so I'll do it like this. While its concept is incredibly daring and its execution seamless, the emotional impact is significantly reduced by my knowledge of the MCU's future. Everyone knows which films are being developed for Phase 4, myself included, so I can't just ignore what I know. In the same way that I consider every single movie leading up to Infinity War, I also consider the future releases, especially since this is a two-part film with an overarching story.My other problem is its balance of characters and storylines. First of all, I cannot imagine the colossal task of having to put together so many characters like the Russo brothers did. This is probably the one issue I was expecting this movie to have because I think it is impossible to perfectly balance this many groups of characters, where protagonists of their own sagas are left to secondary roles. While I do think that they mixed the characters beautifully, sometimes it felt that the film was just going from scene to scene without a real flow.There are a lot of heroes who have to be introduced and teamed up with other ones. Even with 156 minutes of runtime, it feels that they needed more time. The first half of the movie is a bit convoluted since basically, the transitions from scene to scene become repetitive and action-heavy, with no time to breathe. Sometimes it works (the opening scene is jaw-dropping), sometimes it doesn't. These are my only issues with an otherwise outstanding movie, I enjoyed every second of it!Like I said above, the Russo brothers brilliantly combined characters with one another having in mind the tone of each individual saga. Every actor and actress bring their A-game, everyone's script is excellently well-written. If I had to choose, my standouts are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Zoe Saldana as Gamora and, saving the best for last, Josh Brolin as Thanos. Oh my God, Thanos ...Undoubtedly, the star of the film. I never expected that Thanos would have as much screentime as he did, especially when it comes to his backstory. This is the best Marvel villain yet! Even though he is a total maniac, I understand where he is coming from and his motivations are actually plausible. His story is so well-told that I almost wish that he succeeds in his mission ... How crazy is that?!When someone says 'CGI villain', everyone instantly associates that to a horrible and depthless character. Well, Thanos is the exception to the rule because not only the CGI is mind-blowing, his characterization is amazing. Every single second that he is on-screen, I can feel it. His menacing and powerful presence is indescribable in words, you have to see it to believe it. I repeat: best Marvel villain to date!The action is one of the best in the MCU. The fact that this was the first movie in the history of cinema to ever be entirely shot with IMAX cameras definitely elevates every single set piece. Every sequence feels astonishingly epic and the Russo brothers are part of a very small group of directors who can seamlessly handle shaky-cam. Even in the first half, there are so many entertaining action scenes, cleverly filmed and with fantastic visual effects.Nevertheless, the big spectacle is saved for the third act where everything feels like I am watching those last epic battles in The Lord of the Rings franchise. Winter Soldier and Civil War might have better choreography and longer takes of action, but when it comes to the enormous and boundless sequences, Infinity War brings it home with bone-chilling charges on armies and exciting epicness levels. Also, the score is sensational and it definitely helps to raise a few goosebumps both in the emotional and action moments.It is hard to rank it inside the MCU and even harder to do it inside the superhero genre. I do not have the ability or knowledge to do it know. However, it is a ground-breaking and unique film, for sure. There is no other movie with such high stakes as this. Don't get me wrong, even though this film is dark and tragic, the Marvel humor is as funny as ever. In such an action-heavy flick, having the sometimes exaggerated Marvel comedy is a breath of relief and if there is a movie that needs it, is this one.Congrats to the Russo brothers! I never imagined the day where I could experience a film with so many superheroes, let alone such a magnificent one. Avengers: Infinity War is a ground-breaking movie in the genre, it has some of the most epic superhero action I have ever witnessed and one of the best villains of the genre's history, Thanos. This had everything to be an A+ but some issues with its ending and with the overall balance of characters and their storylines bring it down a bit. Still, it is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films ever and I can't wait to watch again!",8,3,4,15 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Quentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of all-time. He has undeniable talent behind the camera, and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year they're released. In addition to that, he's also an extraordinary screenwriter, as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again. His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast, so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those 'fairy tale' years. And that's precisely what this movie is: a fairy tale in Hollywood, hence its title. Let me just leave this here right off the bat: I'm not going to address any controversy surrounding this film (namely, the whole Bruce Lee depiction and the Manson Family, in general), as I'm always fair and impartial to the movie I'm reviewing. Moving on ...My knowledge of the 60s isn't that good. Obviously, I know the whole Sharon Tate story, as well as the famous Manson murders, but when it comes to actual films from that decade, well ... Probably, I only know a few by name, a classic scene, or a memorable soundtrack. Tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period, and that's one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags. There's a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music (references in the songs), wide shots of the city as they drive by (references in the buildings), or even just playing an LP and dancing to it (reference in the songs, again).I understand that these mean something, but if they don't develop the character in any way, then these are just Easter Eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative. The first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much Tarantino knows about that time, and there's nothing wrong with it, as long as it tells a story. That's the second issue I have with the first act: it takes too long to establish its characters, and there's no apparent objective within the story. It feels like a person just strolling around with no destination, which in itself isn't a bad thing. But if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where it's going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting (the Sharon Tate event), then you'll bore the hell out of the audience (a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something, and they weren't in a hurry).Nevertheless, from the moment we start understanding who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are, what they do, what they did, and what they want with their lives, then the film becomes incredibly captivating. It's definitely a character-driven story. It's a fairy tale where Rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star, after being on an exponentially negative path. Cliff, as his stunt double, lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else. These two are inseparable, and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy, even in the darkest moments. OUATIH works because of its beautifully-written characters.If you don't care about them, then you won't enjoy the film at all. In addition to this, if you don't know anything regarding the art of filmmaking, then you'll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull. It's one of those movies that anyone can like. However, for someone who knows and understands how films are made, it will always be a better time at the theater. You can love this movie, sure. But if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques, you'll love it even more. There are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that I can't get to all of them, so I'll just address two of my favorites. The first has to be the black-and-white flicks inside the actual film. Putting Leonardo DiCaprio acting on classic westerns with over-the-top performances is an absolute delight. Watching those features in a 4:3 black-and-white screen, filled with classic sound effects, and cheesy one-liners ... Wonderful.The second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie: the extensive one-take dialogues. I mean, 10 or 15-minute sequences where DiCaprio just gives it his all. This is how every single film should be done. There's even a joke in the movie where Rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together. Unfortunately, that's how most features are done today. Therefore, from watching a simple dialogue scene with DiCaprio and Julia Butters (a 10-year-old little girl!) to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie Rick is filming (this one even has Rick asking his lines, and the camera has to go back to its starting point), everything with no cuts whatsoever ... What can I ask more from a director?!Obviously, if this is a character-driven narrative, the cast has to be genuinely compelling. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie ... I mean, do I even need to explain how phenomenal they are? DiCaprio proves once again he's one of the greatest actors of all-time. The ability that he has to put 200% in every single scene is unbelievable. I even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing, solely due to the actor's performance. The Oscar nom is guaranteed, let's see about the win. Brad Pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display. He has a subtle performance, but it's pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting (apparently) so little effort. Margot Robbie doesn't have that much screentime, but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress' life could be at that time, so she didn't exactly need to deliver her A-game.It's always good to see Al Pacino (Marvin Schwarz) on-screen, and I'm thrilled that Margaret Qualley (Pussycat), who I know from The Leftovers (one of the most underrated TV shows of the century), is finally getting some recognition. Technically, like I said above, it's close to a masterpiece. It's Tarantino, everyone knows what he's capable of, but having in mind his most recent features, it's a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action. There are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography (Robert Richardson), and the editing is always impeccable in Tarantino's features (this time due to Fred Raskin). The score is addictive, and it carries a very significant role in the movie. I would say that if Tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better, this would be a technically perfect film.All in all, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn't the best Quentin Tarantino's movie, but it's undoubtedly one of the year's best. Filled with award-winning lead performances (second Oscar for DiCaprio, please), this character-driven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not. Its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story, but from the moment it's able to find its footing, it's an entertaining ride. If you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art, Tarantino delivers a near-perfect technical production. Its alternate ending to real-life events is meant to be controversial, but for me, it's a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or, indeed, a fairy tale ... in Hollywood.",8,6,9,22 August 2019
Get Out," Rating: A
","Here in Portugal, Get Out was released later so I actually watched it at home ... twice. Yes, a movie like this needs a second watch, a more focused look at the details and a more concentrated mind to find all the clues to the expected twist in any genre film like this one. Well, I'm happy to say that Get Out is right up there in the contenders' list for the best movie of 2017 so far!I never was a big fan of horror movies, but as time goes by I keep enjoying them more and more (maybe before I just watched the pretty bad ones). I didn't know the cast, but I did know Jordan Peele ... However, not as a director. My God, how great is he?! Excellent directing skills throughout the whole runtime: amazing camera-work (some cool long takes), efficient jump-scares with the adequate loud and brief background sounds, but his major achievement is definitely the screenplay. Thought-provoking, disturbing and it handles racism and any preconceptions in a way that, by the end, floored me. Great concept, executed seamlessly.The unknown cast (to me, at least) is just an awesome surprise. Everyone shines in this brilliant movie and elevate it to a super captivating story that already has a fantastic mystery and intrigue surrounding it. Daniel Kaluuya is unbelievably amazing, all of the actors portraying the Armitage's family and housekeepers are equally spectacular and LilRel Howery (Rod Williams) is amazing as the comic relief guy.The tone switches a lot throughout the film. Peele goes from comedy to horror, from drama to thriller in an instant, but it's so well- directed that its fluidity is near perfection. Also, the editing is flawless to my knowledge and the way he depicted and explored every preconception and racist stereotype is really brilliant.A movie definitely worth watching, at least, twice. It has a huge replay value and I already see it as a horror classic.Does it have flaws? Unfortunately, it does ... In the smallest details, but it does. Watching a second time I couldn't help to notice that some scenes are just weird, with no real meaning behind it. Rose's backstory is my main and only issue with the screenplay, but I really can't get more in-depth than this unless I spoil it for you, which I won't. I can just say that there's a plot point that I still struggle to accept/understand.There are also some exposition scenes that could have been handled differently and the pacing dragged a little bit in the second act, but it didn't affect me that much since the writing is so great that it almost passed by without me really noticing.Get Out is probably the most underrated movie in Portugal so far and I'm thrilled that I was able to catch it and watch it twice. Jordan Peele proves that his directing skills are something extraordinary, his screenplay is pure brilliance and his cast is unquestionably incredible, starting on the protagonist, Daniel Kaluuya, to LilRel Howery, the man behind the comedy bits in the film. A very important and thought-provoking movie with social preconceptions on other races explored to the tiniest detail, that only fails to deliver a precise backstory to Rose and it has some really minor issues with its second act's pacing and exposition scenes.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,9,17,6 August 2017
Frozen," Rating: B
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Six years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn't forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it's safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.With extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That's what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney's formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they're young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).It's the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don't get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn't bring anything new story-wise, but it's still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa's magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.Every character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna's complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven's camaraderie, I care about all of them... especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn't really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it's impossible not to love him. He's such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.Counting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it's convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It's an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That's what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it's the genre's variation of 'show, don't tell.'In the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney's formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade's culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn't overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company's standards.",7,0,2,25 November 2019
The Lion King," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't know how I should start, but I guess I'll address something that people might ask: yes, it's a SPOILER-FREE review. Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn't make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character's backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won't take longer than one paragraph.People need to understand that these Disney's remakes aren't here to replace the originals. They're here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the 'additional' part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don't know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from 'I don't want these copy-paste remakes' to 'they changed that specific moment, why didn't they keep it the same?' Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don't want Disney to do these remakes, then just don't watch them. Don't go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven't seen the movie. Moving on ...I love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994's original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It's NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don't understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people's memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn't watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.One proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don't know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar's look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.Speaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He's more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there's one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa's. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones' voice is. As soon as he says 'Simba' in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let's call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters' relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed ... You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original's final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyoncé (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it's another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It's a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.I left the best to last: the visuals. I can't possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward ... a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can't be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don't emote is just inaccurate. You don't need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I'm still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.I don't really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There's no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character's decisions. We always know what's coming, so we're prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we've seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the 'animals don't emote' argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight ... In the original, it isn't nighttime as well.Finally, I just want to address the 'these remakes aren't necessary / no one asked for these' discussion. No one asked for the 1994's movie until it came out. People didn't know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren't here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply 'none'. That's how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994's film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.In the end, it doesn't matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn't matter if we know what's coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney's best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones' voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor's Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original's story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can't lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019's best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide... Go watch it! I can't wait to see it again!",9,4,10,19 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)In this modern horror thriller, a family of four must navigate their lives in silence after mysterious creatures that hunt by sound, threaten their survival.If they hear you, they hunt you.A Quiet Place is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2018, so I was even more excited when I found out that the feedback coming from the festivals was overwhelmingly positive ... And I approve it!John Krasinski proves that not only he is a fantastic actor but he might be an even better director. I love every single technical aspect of the film, from the camera angles to the amazing control of the suspense and tension building up to some truly horrific and shocking scenes. Tonally, it is very well-balanced and the pacing is on-point. Perfect runtime of 90min, not too short and not too long.The sound design has never been such an important part of a movie before. It is so impactful and it powerfully elevates the scares throughout the film. The editing is seamless and the creatures are definitely unique regarding its design. I also love the fact that the characters are not like the cliche dumb people who only make stupid decisions. They are extremely smart, which definitely stands out in the genre's history.Emily Blunt continues to have award-worthy performances with this one, as she is the pinnacle of emotion. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds also have some great displays. The story is extremely captivating, freshly original and beautifully written. For a movie with almost no dialogues, it is remarkable how the screenplay is able to develop its characters while telling a fascinating, original story.I do have a couple of issues, one of which is the ending. It undoubtedly works, but it feels like it is more intended to please the producers rather than the audience. I'm sorry if I'm being too vague, but I want to keep this review spoiler-free. The other one has to do with the actual horror. Even though it has some especially bone-chilling terrifying moments, it relies too much on jump scares and I expected to 'crap my pants' more often and less conventionally.It is still one of the best films of the year so far. I'm proud of what John Krasinski was able to do on his own and I'm certain he has a bright future in front of him. Go see this movie as soon as you can in the most silent theater you know, otherwise... THEY'LL HUNT YOU!",8,0,1,2 May 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Rating: C+
","The Pirates of the Caribbean saga isn't properly a great one ... Its first film established an amazing character that mostly defines Johnny Depp career (he's been criticized in other movies for doing too 'Jack Sparrow-isms') and it was a movie full of adventure, fun and thrilling action scenes. From the second installment to the fourth it has been a tormentous journey, with each movie worse than the latter. Well, one thing is certain: Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge, as it was shown at my theater) is the best one since the first ... Which is not saying much.Let me start with the good things first. The soundtrack keeps being epic and memorable, which makes every action sequence better, even if the action itself isn't great. Henry and Carina are excellent additions to the story as well as the actors portraying those characters. Javier Bardem also does a great job as the villain and Barbossa gets a very emotional role in this installment, captured brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush. Actually, if there's one thing that defines the Pirates of the Caribbean series, is the cast's chemistry, it feels that they're all there having fun and not just there to receive their paycheck.The story is the most interesting since the first film of the franchise, even if it becomes a mess mid-way through and too exaggerated. The ending, I dare to say, it's perfect. I mean, with all its flaws, this movie manages to end on an extremely high note, full of emotion, with a lot of mysteries solved and even some closure (if this isn't the last time we've seen Jack Sparrow, the production is just going to keep drowning the whole thing and ruin it more than what it already is).For all it's worth, I still can't quite give a positive review to this one ...The action scenes are disappointing, they're there more for a comic relief moment than for a thrilling set piece and there's more running and jumping than actual sword and ship-fighting. Some of them are so over-the-top that it just makes them look stupid. The humor is also a bit too much ... Not that the movie isn't funny, it's just that they never once understood when to stop a joke (there are several jokes that go on and on and on and on ...).The pacing is surprisingly slow until the beginning of the third act (best one of the film) and it feels like there's no rush in saving anyone's life. The characters are just going from place to place in the messiest, strangest and badly scripted way possible which doesn't help to keep me captivated at all and actually makes the movie feels longer than it is (even if it is indeed a bit too long).My biggest disappointment is, by far, Johnny Depp. Don't get me wrong, he was born to play this role, but I feel that giving him 100% freedom, which is something that was definitely decided behind the scenes with the directors, kind of damaged his performance. It feels like he's doing an impression of himself portraying Jack Sparrow! In addition to this, Dead Men Tell No Tales is the movie with less screen time for this character ... Interesting, at least.Finally, I didn't enjoy the humor as I expected to. I think the comedy isn't as funny and clever as it was already in the previous movies and the whole film seems like a bunch of cool scenes glued together with a messy plot. The production/directors built the story around these awesome moments instead of the other way around and the final result isn't exactly good.In the end, Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge) is another film that critics are giving too much of a hard time to. It's the best movie since the first one (which is not saying much, I know), it has an interesting premise, some great additions to the cast and story, the usual epic score that helps the action sequences a lot and the ending is nailed perfectly. However, it does have a lot of flaws: from the action scenes themselves to the slow pacing and from the messy plot to the surprisingly not that funny humor, going through a disappointing performance from Johnny Depp, this film isn't near perfection whatsoever.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",5,7,10,6 August 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Rating: B-
","After X-Men: Days of Future Past, I was excited to watch this movie, Bryan Singer has directed all the good X-Men films and this one had the potential to be another one. Now, when I saw the critic's reviews for this I was really concerned, but I really think they overreacted on this one. It's actually a good movie, with some issues that I'm going to discuss further, but it's not the disaster that they're trying to display.I'll start with what I think was the main problem of this movie and what I think made the critics disconnect from it: Apocalypse. This character should have been so much better. In the first 30min of the film, we are told his backstory in Egypt and it's not captivating or interesting ... At all. It's really slow paced and I didn't feel like I was caring for any of that. Also, Apocalypse isn't intimidating at all, there are several scenes where he's standing side-to-side with other characters and he's barely taller than them. His voice worked for me, but his motivations weren't clear. Oscar Isaac already proved he's a good actor, so I don't think it was his fault that Apocalypse looked like that, he just did what he had to do.This is the main reason why I think critics gave such bad reviews because, after a scene with Magneto and his family in a forest, I didn't take my eyes off the screen for one second. Some critics might have just shut down before this scene happened and that's why the reviews are so negative. The movie really builds up from here and it ends with the most action-heavy sequence of all X-Men films.First, the actors: Fassbender and McAvoy work brilliantly together, their scenes are always the best for me and Fassbender is amazing, I was awed by his performance. Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers/Cyclops and Sophie Turner as Jean Grey are great, I can't wait to watch more movies with them. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique is fine, but I don't understand why they needed to show more of Raven than Mystique, I guess the actress didn't like the blue skin so much. Alexandra Shipp finally brings an accent to Storm that fans always criticized Halle Berry for and Evan Peters as Quiksilver ... He's just awesome. I didn't believe they would be able to make a better speed-scene than in the previous movie, but they did! IT'S AWESOME!Now, the end scene is the most action-heavy of all the X-Men movies, like I said before. It's really well shot and I have to say that there's a lot of fan service throughout the film, but in this last act, there are two scenes that they spoiled in the last trailer ... I didn't watch the last trailer, actually, I didn't watch any trailer, so I was really pleased with those particular scenes, involving a known character and all (stop watching trailers, it's way more interesting and captivating this way). Usually, ending a movie with a lot of fights, explosions and all that stuff can take away the film's focus in the story, but I don't think it did because of all the personal scenes that they were able to introduce between the fights.One big issue of this movie is clearly the pacing, they take a lot of time to introduce all these characters and to start building up. In one scene, Apocalypse is looking for mutants, then it's Mystique looking for mutants ... There's a lot of looking and no action whatsoever and that bothered me a little. Apocalypse's motivations remain unclear until the last 10 minutes of the movie and that's a long time. It's a bold move from Bryan Singer because he makes me spend the entire movie worried about something that I shouldn't have been. Re-watching this film, I'll probably understand better this character, but I don't know if it was the right decision to organize the story like this.It's not the best X-Men movie for sure, but it's far better than most of the others. It has some narrative problems and the character of Apocalypse is not the best possible, but it's still a good movie. It's probably more captivating watching a second time ...<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",6,0,2,6 August 2017
Coco," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The most recent Disney-Pixar movie was released late in 2017 and it tells the story of Miguel's (Anthony Gonzalez) dream of becoming a famous musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt).His family has an old ban on music but Miguel wants to follow his dream and he ends up on the Land of the Dead, after a mysterious occurrence. There, he meets the con artist Hector (Gael García Bernal) and they both go on a meaningful journey to discover the secrets of the youngest's family history.If there is one thing that I wish my country would change it's its perspective on animated films. Basically, the overall opinion is that they are made exclusively for kids, which is why The Emoji Movie and The Boss Baby were two of the most successful movies at the last year's box office in Portugal. No parent cares about the film's message as long as it can hold their kids still for a few hours ... I am ashamed of that, especially when Coco is one of the best movies of the year!Pixar has been releasing incredible films year after year and Coco is one of the best in the most recent times. Obviously, the movie's story and its final message are what elevate it and turn it into something pretty marvelous. The screenplay is notably well-written, it is emotionally meaningful and it does not follow a conventional path. Having in mind that youngsters are, in fact, the large percentage of viewers, this is definitely not the usual 'kid-friendly' story with cute characters and a fun adventure.Coco stands alone in relation to other Disney-Pixar films. It deals with highly sensitive themes such as life, death, spirituality and family traditions, and the characters are skeletons for most of the runtime. So, I understand if parents are afraid to take their kids to the theater if they don't know what the story leads up to. After all, a movie's appealing value is also something that should be taken into consideration when producing a film.During the first half of the movie, I struggled to understand why it was receiving so much critical praise. The first act's pacing is a bit too slow contrasting with the exciting rhythm of the second half and the score is not that impressive. Miguel's dream is to be a musician, so I expected astounding songs and the truth is that not even the Oscar-nominated song 'Remember Me' is able to step up during this period. There are a lot of Spanish songs and I don't think it will be an easy-ride for English-speaking children. The score feels a bit underwhelming and that is probably my main issue with the film.However, this mostly applies to the first half. There is a scene midway through that changes everything and completely transforms the movie. Every minor issue that I had until that point disappeared because every single one of those problems has a reason behind it. Every action, every line of dialogue and every song. I love this unexpected moment which makes everything take a totally different meaning and launches the film to its tremendous success.The characters are extremely well-developed, their backstories have so much heart and emotion to them that I couldn't stop myself from crying at the end. I mean, it is impossible not to feel something powerful during that common scene Pixar always nails in the third act of its movies. It proves I really cared about Miguel and his journey to follow his dream, but without casting his family aside.Hector is also a fantastic character who helps Miguel to understand what is really important in life and how to balance everything out. The chemistry between these two characters elevates the story to a remarkably compelling one, filled with not only life lessons but also with tons of adventures throughout. Abuelita (Renée Victor) and the dog Dante are the comedy main sources and they definitely bring some needed brightness and fun to a mostly dramatic story.The voice casting is really great, all of the actors do a phenomenal job. The voices feel realistic and adequate to the characters they respectively portray. The duo of directors also achieves a great result by working with the writers to give the story the build-up it needs for that major scene as well as its necessary misdirection. The tone is very well-balanced and the screenplay has just the right amount of drama, adventure and comedy mixed brilliantly.The visuals are really beautiful, full of color and the animation is seamless. I mean, I always expect to be blown away by the realism that computer animation can bring, but Disney and Pixar are always able to surpass my already high expectations. Entertainment-wise, this film is excellent, but not ground-breaking awesome. Like I said above, this is probably the least kid-charming movie that the companies have produced since the beginning.In a perfect world, this film would be heavily shown to kids since their parents actually care about what they learn from the story, besides having fun with it. As kids, we are like a sponge, we absorb and remember everything people tell us. From what is good to what is bad, kids grow up to become someone that lived with those concepts inserted into their brains.If you take your child to watch a movie which final message is 'look at your phone more', your kid is going to spend more time on the phone and eventually disconnect from the real world. Coco not only teaches how to deal with death but helps to understand that people are only gone if we forget them during life. As long as we remember them, they will always be with us and that is a message I want my future kids to learn and grow up with.All in all, Coco is one of the best films of the year and one of the best animated feature movies Pixar has released in the most recent years. An extremely emotional and heartfelt story, filled with life lessons and with a truly meaningful message for every viewer of any age. The animation is astonishingly beautiful, the characters are fabulous and the song 'Remember Me' is remarkably memorable. A slow pacing during the first half is compensated with an exciting second half, but the overall score ends up being underwhelming. Besides that, some unescapable cliches here and there might lose the audience's appeal but for me, they are flawless.",8,0,0,2 March 2018
1917," 1917 is one of the most immersive technical achievements of all-time!
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Let me just take a deep breath... Wait, one more... Uff, I have no idea how I survived this IMAX screening of 1917. Usually, I don't delve deep into technical stuff since most people don't know or don't care about these attributes, but it's impossible not to address Roger Deakins' cinematography. It's not the first time a film has been edited to appear as 'one shot' (a continuous take), but it never fails to impress me.Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu's Birdman, Silent House starring Elizabeth Olsen, or the famous Rope from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock... all produce the same trick. Even Mr. Robot and The Haunting of Hill House have brought us two phenomenal 'one shot' episodes, edited as well with the so-called 'stitches,' meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer, hence giving that feeling that it's all just one continuous take. Cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera; when the latter 'pans' (movement similar to a head-turn) over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen; or when the characters are simply going through a dark area.Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith (editor) all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie (probably) ever. Yes, it has a simple premise, and the main narrative is basic, but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much. Even if you don't know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made, it's impossible to watch this film and not think 'something feels different about this one.' This is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest, best screen possible. Watching 1917 at home on a TV or a laptop is not going to work at all.Throughout the whole runtime, I felt like I was there with Schofield and Blake. It feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives. I believe 1917 is the best 'one shot' film to date (I've been using the quote signs for a reason, don't mistake it for an actual one shot movie), with Birdman as a close second. If the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting, the former has dozens of nail-biting sequences featuring shootouts, explosions, and a lot of running/walking/swimming through mud, dead corpses, blood, and way too many nasty rats.I really have no words to describe Roger Deakins' cinematography. It's not merely a film, it's a whole experience. It's not just another cool technical achievement. It's the entire foundation of 1917, and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater. However, a lot of people are completely ignoring Lee Smith's work. Don't forget, this isn't an actual one shot movie. If it's been edited to look like one continuous take, and if it actually does appear to be a single take, then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else. Yes, he doesn't have to work with thousands of cuts (I counted 14, but I'm sure there's more), but they still exist, and he has to make sure no one feels them. And he did so perfectly.My last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to Sam Mendes and Thomas Newman. As the director, Mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors. Not only has he directed my favorite Bond film (Skyfall), but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of all-time. As for Newman, I just wish that Joker had been released in another year because 1917's score is fantastic. Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir is likely taking the Oscar for Best Original Score, but if Thomas Newman takes it, I'll still be delighted.A lot of comparisons are being made with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. They're similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience. Story and character-wise, both movies don't really develop that much. Nolan's film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world, but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building. I didn't mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important. They were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations, similar to 1917. However, I do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists.George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman's characters have small arcs, but they exist. In the beginning, Blake is the emotional-driven character, while Schofield seems to be the rational one. We, as the audience, care about the mission first, but as time goes by, we learn about their personal traits and motivations. By the end of the film, I was crying. Both play off of each other really well, but it's their dialogue that impresses me the most. What seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass, it truly isn't. If it's not meaningful at the time, it's going to be. The acting is more physical than anything, and both deliver outstanding performances.I would say I love 1917 as much as I love Dunkirk. I might be tempted to choose the former due to the 'recency effect,' but there's one small aspect that negatively affects both. Their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements don't work as well on a regular TV in the comfort of our own home. You will never feel or understand that 'immersive experience' that everyone talks about. You won't know what made people to be blown away. You won't love it as much as everyone else. So, please, do NOT miss 1917 in theaters!Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith. Director, director of photography, editor. Three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best WWI movies of all-time. Edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by Deakins' always jaw-dropping cinematography, Thomas Newman emotionally powerful score, Mendes impeccable directing, and Smith's seamless editing. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it's the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. Production design, costume design, sound, you name it. Everything is absolutely perfect. It's meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won't get at home. It's going straight into my Top10: Best Movies of 2019, and I hope you'll love it as much as I do.Rating: A",9,4,8,25 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rating: B+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Finally, I managed to watch one of my most anticipated movies of 2017! I am an authentic fanboy of the Star Wars saga and I loved its return two years ago when The Force Awakens was released. Everything looked better, sounded better and the story certainly didn't disappoint me. So, obviously, I was extremely looking forward to The Last Jedi.Apparently, critics love Episode VIII but fans not so much. Me, well ... I don't LOVE it, but I do enjoy it very much. I do think it is a bit below the previous film's overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not. I am also confident that I know why the fans are not loving this movie and I will explain that after a few paragraphs.This time, I am going to start at the other side of the spectrum. I will begin my review with the film's problems because I do need to get them out of my mind, especially this one ... The subplot involving Finn (John Boyega), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and DJ (Benicio Del Toro), some of the few new characters added to the franchise, completely ruins the movie's pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story. It is, by far, the worst issue I have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem ... It creates a whole other set of them.The first act's pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences. However, the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more story-driven, full of mystery-unlocking and character-development scenes. Finn and Rose's nonsense adventure just turns everything slower and even strange. It ends up needlessly extending the runtime (the film could have easily been 15min shorter) and worse ... Possibly creating a love triangle with Rey (I am not even going to discuss this).Apart from this major issue(s), I have some minor problems. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this new-generation trilogy. Gleeson is fine, he actually achieves a good over-the-top performance, but his character is just tumbling off the rails. Also, on a more technical aspect, the writing does not flow as well as it did on J.J. Abrams' screenplay. There are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all.I wrote earlier about the fans' reasons for them to be disappointed and well, the marketing for the movie did not lie: they do take a lot of chances with this one. Rian Johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mind-blowing and unanimously accepted. I do not want to give anything away from the plot, so I am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character, I either simply accept them or I truly love them. As for the rest, I am, at most, underwhelmed (yet, I trust and understand the decisions they went with).People need to learn how to deal with their own expectations. If you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not, you can't blame the film for not following your crazy idea. So, please, don't start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didn't fulfill your ridiculously high expectations. Even if they are grounded and thoughtful, you have to embrace the production's approach to the character/story. If it makes sense, then it is as valid as any other theory. It might be underwhelming if you have high expectations, but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking.This is why I think fans are not loving The Last Jedi. The production takes a lot of risks and some of them don't work with everyone, mostly due to fans' radical theories that don't have a place in the film. I think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing, myself included. Some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch. Since I do not have time to do it before the year's end, I am going with what I have.Switching to the light side (hehe), I do enjoy this movie a lot. Every cast member that was great in Episode VII, transcends themselves in this one. Daisy Ridley is superb as Rey. She has such a massive range of expressions and I am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed. From the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes, she is awesome. Her character's mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Luke Skywalker inflict chills all over my body.Mark Hamill's comeback can't be any more amazing than it is. He delivers a fantastic, emotion-full and very compelling performance. It is even more unbelievable knowing that Hamill had strong personal arguments against the director's interpretation of what was better for Luke. If he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is, then I must praise his exemplary working principles.Luke and Rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and I love every single second filmed on that piece of land. I have to admit that I am a bit frustrated because I think the film should have more time with these two, but due to the issues mentioned in the beginning of my review, the runtime can't be much more stretched. I love what they did with Luke, even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey.Adam Driver as Kylo Ren ... The undoubtful star of the whole show. Driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless. He has a powerful, dark, mysterious, compelling and commanding display as one of the most complex and multi-layered characters of the Star Wars saga. Ren's conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with Rey are so jaw-dropping spectacular that I can't even describe them properly.John Boyega is once again great as Finn, even though he is part of that horrible subplot. Boyega delivers a convincing performance and Finn shines through some awesome action set pieces. Kelly Marie Tran is actually good as Rose, it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative, even though her backstory is pretty touching. Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the Porgs, the new cute animals implemented in the Star Wars universe, have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there.Oscar Isaac is quite lucky because Poe Dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie. Isaac offers a very passionate display as Poe goes through some significant character development. His impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by Leia (Carrie Fisher) during the whole time. It is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the film's main plot.Carrie Fisher is elegant and beautiful as Leia, a character that has a lot more screentime than what I expected. I always love seeing Fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me. Andy Serkis is remarkable as Supreme Leader Snoke, but his character is yet another plot's detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much. I still feel underwhelmed by Snoke in this movie for several reasons, but after some thinking, I do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant.Rian Johnson work as the director is better than him as the writer. The visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful, once again, there is a lot less CGI than you probably think. Excellent cinematography and the John Williams' score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement. The action sequences are mind-blowing, the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes.The main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that I thoroughly love. A lot of unexpected twists and turns make The Last Jedi more original than The Force Awakens, even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming, and it also has a very well balanced tone. Finally, a thrilling, breathtaking, action-heavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments.All in all, Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Terrific performances from the cast, but a flawlessly powerful display from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren steals the spotlight. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed. The main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jaw-dropping, epic action sequences and excellent character-development scenes. Nevertheless, it departs from JJ's visual storytelling, delivering a more exposition-heavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down, largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving Finn and Rose. In the end, it still belongs to my top half of the saga, fighting for the 4th spot with Return Of The Jedi and Rogue One.",8,1,4,26 December 2017
Mission: Impossible II," Rating: D+
","Mission: Impossible - Fallout is coming out next week, so naturally I decided to watch and review every single movie of the franchise. I already wrote my thoughts on Mission: Impossible (1996) and now it is time for the second installment of the saga ... Where we, unfortunately, reach the bottom (better sooner than later).Even though the action stunts are still mostly realistic and very well filmed, they reach a point where I can't buy into them anymore. From two guys colliding mid-air after jumping from their bikes at high speed to explosions spread throughout the entire runtime, this film is pretty bad. 60 minutes into it and there isn't a single action sequence. The suspense and tension, which are a stamp of the first movie, are nowhere near the levels that they used to be, and the slow-motion is excessively employed.The story incorporates a love triangle between Ethan Hunt, Sean Ambrose, and Nyah that feels so strangely awkward and unnecessary. There is an evident James Bond vibe to this film, and that is precisely what wrecked it. This is Mission: Impossible and John Woo almost ruined the whole saga. Tom Cruise's character is an entirely different agent. He transforms himself into this sort of playboy kind of guy who has nothing to do with the Hunt that I know from M:I-1. The whole story hinges on the audience's feelings about his relationship with Nyah, but I can't care enough about Thandie Newton's character because she simply has no depth!Ving Rhames was by far the best secondary character in the first movie. In this one, Luther is just a computer nerd and his funny personality is gone. Dougray Scott plays a boring villain with generic motivations, and everyone else doesn't really matter. There is a severe lack of character development. Nevertheless, the saving grace of M:I-2 is definitely its cast. Newton is very charming as Nyah, Scott makes his awful script more believable and Cruise is ... Well, Tom Cruise.He continues to do all his stunts, and there are some 'money shots' that he performs exceptionally well. To be honest, this film has some beautiful cinematography and a magnificent Hans Zimmer's score. Even when the action takes itself too seriously, these aspects at least make it bearable. John Woo does a lot of things the wrong way, but he adds some subtle details to his shots that become important to the plot later on.However, this is about it. There are so many cons to overwhelm the pros. The editing is all over the place. The pacing is no longer frenetic as it was in the previous movie. Like I wrote above, I have to wait more than one hour to enjoy some freaking action. The first half of the film is slow and tedious, while the second half starts to accelerate to finish in style. The ending has so much action that most of it becomes stupid. I mean, really stupid. Some moments are supposed to be taken seriously, but it is a tough task not to laugh at the hilarious set pieces.How can a sequel to such a fantastic action movie be so bad? Well, M:I-2 is the undeniable proof. There are so many things gone wrong with this one. John Woo transformed a confusing yet mysterious plot from the first installment into a hilariously awful screenplay. The plot is quite predictable, the story is emotionally weightless, and even the action goes to levels of dumbness that I've only witnessed in the worst possible films. A great cast and some nice technical details help counterweigh the cons, but Tom Cruise's lead saves the day.",3,4,6,30 July 2018
Logan," Rating: A
","Well, if you're thinking this is just another typical X-Men or cliché superhero movie ... You're seriously wrong. Of all the comic- book movies I've seen, I dare to say this is the one that I can finally call a goddamn DRAMA. Plus, this time it's rated R! Thank you Deadpool, I honestly hope that we'll have more films like this in the future.The very first scene instantly transports us to a different tone that we're not used to seeing in this type of films. It's darker, gritty, bloody, gruesome, grisly, did I mention bloody? There are so many scenes that just stuck to my memory, I constantly jaw-dropped at almost every single action scene. AWESOME! Excellent direction by James Mangold, the quick cuts worried me at the beginning, but it's almost flawless. As for the action, this movie nails it and surpassed the already huge hype that it had. Best action from the whole  X-Men franchise.Hugh Jackman ... It's an epic goodbye. As always, he's magnificent which I already expected before entering the theater. I mean, it's a character that he's been playing for almost 20 years, it's a routine that he knows from scratch, but this one is really the best from him.  A very different Logan and he nailed it perfectly. Patrick Stewart is great as always and this time he's even funnier than Hugh Jackman! However, the real surprise is Dafne Keen (Laura), who plays the extraordinary kid. She's able to connect with the audience without saying a SINGLE WORD until the beginning of the third act. Honestly, she reminded me of Millie Bobby Brown's powerful performance of Eleven on Stranger Things. She's that good. Marvel just keeps getting the casting right, again and again, every single time.I can't and I won't tell you much about the story. What I can say is that this is definitely the most emotional and captivated that I've ever been in an X-Men movie. The ending is as perfect as it can be and the movie is honestly more than I expected it to be. It surpassed the hype surrounding it and I can only congratulate James Mangold for the brilliant work.Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect as a whole (none is) even if it has a lot of perfect action scenes and performances. The pacing drops to a slow-burn in the second act (the least great of the three ... still great, though) and, don't get me wrong, it is needed and it's well compensated later in the movie, but it still dragged on for a little too much. The villain worked for the plot, I don't have that many problems with him even if I did expect more from him. A few exposition scenes, in the beginning, explaining the origins and purpose of some important backstory nagged me a bit, I think they had the possibilities and means to achieve a better way to explain everything (as they did in some other situations throughout the film) without recurring to an iPhone video.All of these are minor issues because Logan is f*cking AWESOME! The bloodiest X-Men movie ever, the best X-Men action scenes ever and the best Hugh Jackman in all of the franchise: this is the best film from the X-Men universe. An emotional DRAMA, with powerful performances from both main and supporting actors, a beautiful ending and an epic journey that now (supposedly) ends. Thank you, Hugh Jackman.

Midsommar," Rating: B
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of 2018, so obviously, Ari Aster's second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement. Fortunately, even though Midsommar is only being released now in my country, I was able to stay away from spoilers, as well as from any sort of images or clips. As you might expect, this is not a typical horror movie, even though it's being marketed as belonging to the genre. Sure, it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre, but it definitely doesn't play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at night.Hereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment, besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public. Midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive. First of all, it drags. There's no denying it. The first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in, which in a 140-minute runtime is a bit too far ahead. Granted, it's one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight I've ever seen, but its build-up (extremely well-done) takes a big part of the second act, slowing down the pacing too much.Additionally, it's a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear. If you didn't enjoy Aster's first feature because it didn't have enough scary sequences, Midsommar isn't going to convert you to being a fan of his work. Similarly to Ad Astra (just released last week), it's a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects. If you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained, then you might want to think again. I can't stress this enough: you need to pay attention to what you're watching!Hints to what the story holds for us are everywhere, especially in the walls. Through paintings, runes, and hand-drawings, Ari Aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going. It's a film about two key themes: how to deal with grief, and how to handle a complicated relationship. These are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how they're being developed. I love how Aster addresses the latter topic (he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own), but I'm disappointed by the way he put the former into the 'background'.The first 15-20 minutes deal with what happens to Dani's life, and it's never approached again, even though there's a vague idea of what could have actually happened, by the end of the movie. Regarding the other point, it isn't exactly a 'toxic' relationship that we've seen in previous films, but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other. Hence, some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something. It's a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through. Technically, this is one of 2019's most fascinating productions.From the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing, from the stunningly impressive production design (again, the WALLS!) to the immersive score ... Ari Aster is no joke. The way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me, who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking. There are so many long takes with Florence Pugh giving her all, just raw and powerful emotions. It's her career-best performance, no doubt about it. Her character's storyline is partially what brings the 'horror' to the narrative. Just like Toni Colette on Hereditary, Pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season, as well as the movie's technical achievements since the horror genre still didn't convince enough people to give a shot.Regarding the other characters, they're my main issue. They simply felt like plot devices. Will Poulter (Mark) is funny as the comic-relief guy, but his character, like every other one besides Dani, doesn't do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots (if there are any). They barely have any backstory, and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving Aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind. There are incredibly shocking, bloody, and jaw-dropping scenes, some might make you feel uncomfortable, others might make you laugh. But they're all meant to shock you in some shape or form.Whether you love it or hate it, Midsommar is memorable. If you didn't enjoy Hereditary due to the lack of jump scares, the former isn't for you then. Midsommar requires full attention, patience, and an open-minded mentality. It's not a generic horror flick, so don't go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares. Expectations are everything, so moderate them in the best way possible. It has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief, but if you LOOK AT THE WALLS, you'll be able to (maybe) follow the story a bit better.Technically, Ari Aster delivers a masterful work, with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography, plus seamless editing. Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance, but her supporting cast didn't do much with their under-developed characters. The film drags a lot, and it can become tedious at some point, but in the end, it's one of those movies that sticks with you. A second viewing may be necessary, and it will probably be a better experience. Can't wait to find out. Go see it!",7,0,3,27 September 2019
Mission: Impossible," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Mission: Impossible - Fallout is coming out next week, so naturally I decided to watch and review every single movie of the franchise. With so many remakes and reboots of famous sagas, it is a breath of relief that M:I is actually one that makes sense to keep doing. Since the third installment that it keeps continuously improving on the previous film and the evolution of visual effects didn't even affect the movies' essence. If there's one thing that this franchise is known for, is the realistic and practical method of filming action, instead of the CGI which is being used in excess more and more each day that goes by.By the time of the original release of this film, Tom Cruise was not yet an action movie icon. He was still trying to prove himself, and this was the film that started it all. Not only he portrays an exceptional character, but he tremendously elevates it when it comes to the action moments. He is also really expressive in the suspenseful scenes, and he is directly connected to some of the most prominent and extraordinary tension moments in the action movies history.Ethan Hunt, our hero, is very well-written and extremely interesting. The several ways by which he tries to decipher who framed him are filled with great details, amplified by the remarkable work of Brian DePalma, as the director. Excellent shots and phenomenal control of the tension in every scene. For a film released more than 20 years ago, most of its craft still holds up pretty well.As for the remaining cast, Ving Rhames stands out as Luther since he brings a very cool and funny vibe to the movie. Jon Voight portrays Hunt's boss, Jim Phelps, and he definitely leaves a good impression. Everyone else just serves the plot as it goes and that is my main issue with this first installment. If there's one thing that the audience members of 1996 and 2018 have in common is that they want easy-to-follow stories and big, brainless, illogical action ...I praise Mission: Impossible because it really tries to have a mysterious storyline. After all, we are watching an espionage film. However, even with me paying attention to every single line, it is undoubtedly confusing, to say the least. There are a lot of details in the screenplay that just don't quite come together at the end. The antagonist's motivations are a bit unclear as well as the ones from the characters related to it. The action set pieces are filled with special effects, but the beginning of incredible practical stunts started with this one. Like I wrote above, one of the most iconic, suspenseful scenes in movie history, is when Hunt tries to break into the CIA. That scene alone makes action films nowadays look like an absolute waste of time and money. The amount of tension build up during that moment is ridiculous. The lack of background music is astonishingly ballsy, and it totally works. Everything about that scene is pure perfection!Throughout the movie, there are more than a couple of practical stunts but the ending kind of ruins it all. A completely illogical and absurd action sequence to end such a great film frustrates me a little bit, even considering the fact that this movie was not released in this century. I don't think it needed to be this 'blockbuster-y,' and it breaks the realistic feel that the film had until that point.Before I forget, the score ... It is an impossible mission (ha...ha...ha) to forget the famous spy theme song. It is the tangible proof of the overwhelming success of this movie. It became the ringtone for most phones and even people that didn't watch any of the M:I films know the recognizable tone. Regarding the other definition of tone, it is another aspect that DePalma seamlessly balanced. The pacing never breaks down, and I didn't feel bored or distracted for a single second.The first installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise still incredibly holds up 20 years later. Tom Cruise is the living evidence of the movie's success as he became one of the most iconic action film stars. DePalma's last great movie is filled with excellent direction, a very captivating protagonist, some fantastic action scenes and a memorable soundtrack. However, in the writing department, things went a little overboard and the plot is too confusing. The ending action sequence is a bit of a letdown, but the frenetic pacing provides a blast of entertainment and one of the most influential action films of all-time.",8,1,2,29 July 2018
La La Land," Rating: A+
","At the very beginning of every year, I write a list of all of the movies that I've been anticipating for a long time (mostly based on comic-books) and those that either have a good premise, a good director and/or a good cast. La La Land didn't have a release date in January (I think), but even if they had, I'd have probably left it out (maybe I did). I don't have a least favorite genre, I enjoy watching every type of movie, but musicals are by far the ones that I find to be less interesting or even well-made so, even with a great director and cast, I only got the urge to watch this film because of all of the Oscar talk and the beautiful soundtrack that I've been listening to in the last couple of days ...Perfect. Magic. Absolutely stunning. I don't have words to describe how AMAZING Chazelle's direction is. I mean, anyone can enjoy this film because it IS great entertainment, but the amount of work that they had with this MASTERPIECE is unbelievable. Extremely LOOOOONG takes, over and over again, with excellent synchronized choreography and an original score to remember forever and ever. Every single shot drops such marvelous quality that I kept being surprised every single scene. This is the best directing skills that I've seen from a director since God knows when. Congratulations, Damien Chazelle. You won yourself an Oscar, a Golden Globe and every other award that honors the man behind everything.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are incredible and I can't imagine any other actors portraying their roles. Gosling is the usual funny, charming and loving guy, while Emma Stone definitely has her career- best performance (even better than on Birdman), worthy of many awards. The way they interpret the songs is so captivating and emotional that they just make the music even greater (watching besides listening gives it such a more compelling meaning). The score is so beautiful and heartfelt that it's impossible to explain through words the feelings one has as listening to them ... Just fantastic.My only concern with the movie was the romance and the overall story, I thought it would be super cliché and follow the usual paths that this type of films have ... Nop. Even the story is great. I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but let me just say that cliché is not a word that I'll use to describe this movie. It doesn't follow anything, it has its own original story and the romance is super smooth as the actors' terrific performances. It FEELS real.I never thought I'd say this, ever, but ... La La Land is (probably) the best film of 2016 and my favorite, for sure. One of the best direction I've ever seen from anyone (please, Damien Chazelle keep going!), an absolutely pitch-perfect duo (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a perfect chemistry), a fantastic non-cliché original story about pursuing dreams and the most beautiful and heartfelt soundtrack that I'll listen over and over again for God knows how long ... Magical. Rememberable. I can't wait to watch it again!!!<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",10,5,7,6 August 2017
Don't Breathe," Rating: A
","There's no way to describe how tense and suspenseful is this movie. Everything that I could possibly write here would come out as an understatement to how awesome is the quality of this film.I don't even have to be specific and go through each section that makes a movie since everything is near perfection: direction, sound, editing, the cast's performances, characters, ... I could go on and on, but it's no use. I love it! I was constantly on the edge of my seat!I found myself holding my breath as well as the characters when the blind man (played excellently by Stephen Lang) would pass by them, the thrilling building suspense to a scare (a REAL scare) kept me so captivated that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! When they start to discover who the man really is and what he's capable of, the level of fear increases dramatically as our burglars, especially Rocky (Jane Levy) and Alex (Dylan Minnette) who are played by two amazing actors, try to escape this clearly not defenseless man.My only issue with this movie and there one thing that keeps it from being an A+ is the ending. Without spoiling anything, there's a part when it cuts to black and I thought to myself 'Perfect. Let's go home to write an awesome review' ... And then it fades back in. The next few minutes don't add anything to the story and it can actually leave you frustrated like it left me. It's the only reason why I can't give this one the maximum rating.Still, this is by far the most suspenseful, thrilling and scaring movie that I've seen this year, with all its elements near perfection, but an ending that doesn't do justice to the amazing film that was created. Go watch it!<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,1,2,6 August 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Rating: B
","First of all, this is probably the Disney's movie that influenced me the less since I didn't watch Beauty and the Beast 100x times when I was a kid. Instead, I spent that time with the awesome The Lion King, which is also getting a live-action remake. Basically, my opinion will not have many comparisons with the original 1991 movie simply because I can't really remember the film that well.So, what did I think about this one? Well, while it didn't amaze or surprised me like The Jungle Book did, it's still a great movie. The story is definitely darker and scarier than the original, which I did enjoy a lot. The small changes to the screenplay work just fine and actually add something that the original didn't have (mainly because it was an animated movie mostly created just for kids), as well as all of the characters.The casting is pitch-perfect: Emma Watson is the only actress that I can see portraying Belle the way she did. Really, really brilliant. Luke Evans (Gaston) also has a great performance and Josh Gad portrayed well a different Le Fou (if you've seen the news, you know what I'm talking about ... Some theaters even refused to show the movie due to this character's new personality). The friendship between Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) gives the best comedy moments of the entire film and that was hilarious to watch.As for the score, there were a lot of questions as soon as the movie got a release date: what songs will they keep? Which ones are they going to cut? Are they going to change or add something new? Well, the original songs are great as they always were, but the new ones ... It didn't work. The movie has more than a two-hour runtime and Bill Condon wasn't able to balance everything. The time between the dialogue and singing scenes was too short, which started to annoy me: 'Really? Another song? They just sang for ten minutes, like two minutes ago ...'. This affected the pacing a lot and there were a lot of moments where I was just off. Completely lost.Also, the movie starts by telling us the Beast's past (literally narrating it to the audience), as the action goes without any dialogue. Bad choice, it's a huge exposition scene that could have been told way better and when I realized that they wasted most of the time with too much singing, I am now sure that the film would be a lot more captivating than it was.Beauty and the Beast continues the excellent work Disney is doing with the live-action remakes and I'm now sure that if The Lion King really hits the screens again ... Well, who knows if an Oscar is right behind the corner. This remake is beautifully crafted and has a perfectly amazing cast, with a great dark touch to the original movie's screenplay. However, it's far from perfect: too much singing and the time between song and dialogue is too short, which negatively influences its pacing and interest. Also, the Beast's past is badly explored and an opportunity to get the audience more attached to the characters is wasted.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",7,7,11,6 August 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Rating: B
","The first installment of this saga was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. Its hilarious jokes and the visually mind-blowing action scenes plus a cast full of chemistry elevated a movie with a simple superhero plot to one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).GOTG Vol. 2 is pretty much the same, but with some family issues. I'll answer the question that everyone has on their minds: 'is it better than the first one?' ... No. Honestly, I think the former is far better. Not that this one is bad (it isn't), but one of the main reasons the first film was successful was because everything was new and different. They used the more dramatic and suspenseful moments that we've seen over and over again in every single movie ever made and placed a comic relief moment in the middle or at the end of the scene. Even if the joke didn't land, it was still so original that most people really enjoyed the movie.The humor is as hilariously great as in the first film. Some jokes are indeed pushed too far and it ruins some scenes that could have received a better tone to it. Most of the comedy is successful mainly due to the incredible cast. Once again, Chris Pratt nails it, not only as the funny guy, but in the dramatic scenes he's compelling as well. Zoe Saldana (Gamora) and Karen Gillan (Nebula) have a lot of screen time together and, while the former really delivers, the latter ...  delivers too much, she overacts most of her scenes and that kind of threw me off.However, believe it or not, the real star of this film is Yondu (Michael Rooker). This character has so much development throughout the movie and it's a joy to watch Rooker's amazing performance. As expected, the relationship between Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) is adorably funny and Dave Bautista (Drax) keeps surprising me (definitely the best wrestler-to-actor transition since Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson).As for final praises, the soundtrack is great once again (even if some of the choices are clearly some plot points), the action sequences are good enough and the visuals are amazingly stunning.These are the things that I (and most fans, I guess) expected, so until here I'm pretty much fine with the movie. The problem is that this second installment has a lot more issues than the first one ... For the first hour-ish, I spent the whole time thinking 'is this going somewhere? Who's the villain? Is there a villain? Why do I feel bored? This joke is still going on?'. The aim of this film isn't quite clear until the second half of the film and once I get there, there are a lot of pacing issues and the story becomes uneven (even if it has some thrilling action scenes spread through it).If you've seen the trailers, Kurt Russell (Ego) is in this movie and he's great as always, but the main story that the film follows (with Kurt and Chris being a big part of it) didn't captivate me that much because there are so many subplots involving the other characters that when all of it comes together, it doesn't connect very well. It's like the film couldn't figure out what to do with so many supporting characters, they're just ... There.There's also this civilization that you can see in the trailers (they're all gold ... they're all painted gold for some reason) that work fine for the opening scene, but they keep showing up throughout the film and it's just another thing that bothered me. This is definitely the more 'stand-alone' movie from the MCU's Phase Three. There isn't a single tie or set-up to another film from the universe and the fanboy in me wished that it had something on it (even the FIVE post-credits scenes don't show that much).Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't better than the first one, but it stays true to my expectations. The whole movie is hilarious, the cast has an unbelievable chemistry and Michael Rooker steals the show from Chris Pratt, who also has a great performance. The visuals are stunning, the action set pieces are good and the soundtrack keeps being awesome. However, there are some issues: the pacing is off, the comedy becomes forced, Karen Gillan is the worst part of the film, even if the Nebula-Gamora subplot is interesting, and the main story isn't as captivating as it should be since the supporting characters are terribly misused.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",7,0,3,6 August 2017
The Shape of Water," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Guillermo del Toro proves that his visuals are as impeccable as ever. Such a beautifully directed film, with so much vivid colors and wonderful production design. The editing is flawless, the score is magical and the cinematography is incredibly gorgeous.Sally Hawkins (Elisa Esposito) has a phenomenal performance. She is able to transmit her feelings in such a classy way and without saying a single word throughout the entire movie. Oscar-worthy display as well as the rest of the fantastic cast. Michael Shannon (Strickland) and Octavia Spencer (Zelda) are great, but Richard Jenkins (Giles) is right up there with Sally. An all-star cast delivers perfect performances that carry a meaningful, romantic and unique story.Unfortunately, not everything is perfect. The tone and the pacing are a bit unbalanced, but my main issue is the cheesy and predictable third act. Even though the story alone justifies watching this film, some people might find creepy the relationship between Elisa and the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones).Still, it is a brilliant screenplay with a lot of important messages and del Toro does an outstanding job directing The Shape of Water, which will surely get him a win at the 90th Academy Awards. It does not do enough for entering my Top10: Best Movies of 2017, but it gets a well-deserved Honorable Mention.",8,22,40,3 March 2018
The Untouchables," The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than 30 years!
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Capone starring Tom Hardy is being released this week, so I decided to visit a classic from the late 80s that also features Al Capone (this time portrayed by Robert De Niro). One of my 2020's resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director's filmography before his/her next big movie. I'll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I'll definitely rewatch and review the 1998's original. You get my point.The Untouchables is one of those classics I've already seen a few times, but I can't quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn't remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I'll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987's flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era.I love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it's not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative 'line-cut-line' type of dialogue. I'm not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor's movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count.The screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character's decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it's always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner.I don't know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner's display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It's his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I'm not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn't become that big of a distraction that I can't connect with his character.Regarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He's charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone.Sure, it's a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it's a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he's just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they're really cool scenes, but he doesn't feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power.All in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.Rating: A-",8,0,0,13 May 2020
Zombieland," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I haven't seen Zombieland in quite a few years, but with its sequel being released this week, now it's the perfect moment to go back to the hilarious world of zombies. It still holds up incredibly well. In a time where zombie films and TV shows were starting to come up (The Walking Dead premiered one year later), this post-apocalyptic zombie comedy flick still remains as one of the best zombie movies of the century. Their use quickly became something cliche, and neither funny or scary. Nowadays, people are used to seeing the living dead on the screen all the time, so why does a 2009's film like this still work?Well, first of all, the outstanding cast is halfway through success. In 2009, only Woody Harrelson was already a renowned adult actor. Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg didn't star in anything truly remarkable yet, so much that Abigail Breslin was more recognizable than them. Even with only 13-years-old, she already had an Oscar nomination in a supporting role (Little Miss Sunshine). However, everyone delivers fantastic performances, which carry the simplistic yet entertaining story to such a success that it became a zombie classic.Harrelson portraying Tallahassee, the guy who's not scared of anything and likes to 'enjoy the little things', is one of his career's coolest roles. Eisenberg is not exactly the type of actor I like since he can only do so much with his acting abilities. He always offers the same type of character: a quirky, twitch-full, idiosyncratic personality, which most of the times doesn't work. Contrary to this tendency, Columbus is a character that logically and hilariously fits this model, hence Eisenberg is the movie's primary source of comedy. From his list of rules to his weird behavior, everything feels natural since the character's background justifies his awkward self.Stone and Breslin share great moments together, as well as Harrelson and Eisenberg, but the former duo has less exciting sequences. Nevertheless, even though the girls could have received more character development, their relationship gives them a compelling reason for us to care about. Wichita might just look like the cliche hot girl who falls for the good guy, but she would do anything to protect her sister, and her love for Little Rock does give her some gravitas. The cast's chemistry is undeniably astonishing. It's visually palpable that they had tons of fun doing this film, and that elevates every single conversation or action scene.The short runtime allows for a fast-paced story, packed with fun moments, and a lot of bloody zombie killings. The production design is remarkable. Excellent use of practical effects and real sets, plus a perfect soundtrack. Ruben Fleischer knew precisely what he wanted the movie to be, and he never tried to make it something more. Yes, it still involves a romance of sorts, and some backstories might not be funny or joyful. However, it never feels forced or fabricated. It never overextends its stay because Zombieland is neither a romance or a drama. It's purposefully campy, plays with stereotypes creatively, and it's merely 88 minutes of good fun. We are in 2019, and studios forgot how to make films like this!Every year, there are dozens of blockbusters that would be extremely entertaining if studios would just let them be what they are meant to, but no. They need to have some relevant story that carries a political tone or a social message. Zombieland has all the attributes of a pure blockbuster: a phenomenal cast, a straightforward narrative packed with thrilling sequences, a short runtime with fast pacing, compelling characters, and thousands of zombies. Put together a funny screenplay filled with chuckle-worthy jokes, and you have yourself one of the best zombie movies of the century. It's one of those films which don't exactly have what people address as 'flaws'. Zombieland has its cliches and lazy exposition, but it heavily compensates them with 80 minutes or so of spectacular entertainment. It's a zombie cult classic. Nut up or shut up, but watch the goddamn movie!",8,1,2,26 October 2019
Joker," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Obviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.I'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same 'version' of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.In conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show ... He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.Throughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). 'The world is getting crazier out there', and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur's personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.It's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax ... I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just... there.A Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.Regarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater 'happy' or 'joyful', then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!Nowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?All in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!PS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.",9,4,7,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Rating: C
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)So, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year's best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director's chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema...Well, I got to be honest: I'm disappointed. It's not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn't even come close to its predecessor's heels. I disagree with some headlines I've read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There's barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn't as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.Some say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film's runtime, especially if it's over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There's more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that's funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain's (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn't help the pacing.The first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they're doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it's pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie's subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn't have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.Beverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little 'kid' who's scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn't do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017's movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.Finally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it's a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn't have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it's pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great...James McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsg책rd had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn't have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsg책rd since there's so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.Andy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman's screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions.In the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn't as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there's excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it's ... okay.",5,1,3,12 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Rating: C
","This is the second movie of the already confirmed 'Monster-verse', which has Godzilla as the first film (so we can probably have a Kong v Godzilla in a near future ...) which I actually enjoyed. Kong: Skull Island however ... Well, let me point the good stuff first.The monsters are amazing, not only Kong, but the creatures of this island are beautiful to look at. The fights between Kong and the other monsters are thrilling, extremely well-shot and super entertaining. The detail that goes into those scenes are incredible and I'm sure I'll rewatch them as soon as I can.However, that's about the only good stuff about the film. The amazing visual quality that portrays the creatures doesn't really show in the rest of the runtime. There are scenes which have a surprisingly horrible and OBVIOUS green-screen and that affected me throughout the film because it wasn't just a single mistake ... There are a bunch of them.The real problem is the characters. I can't believe that they were able to screw that up with such a top-level cast. Everyone is bland, with no character development whatsoever and they're just there so Kong can play with them and eventually kill them. With the exceptions of Samuel L. Jackson's and John. C. Reilly's characters, I didn't care for any of the protagonists. Each character has ONE scene (and I'm being generous) to tell us why should we care about them and, even if one or two are able to have it, it's not enough.The script is lazy and just bad. The exposition scenes are constant and even then, the writing doesn't help. With a story with such a simple and good premise plus some interesting sub-plots during the second act, the screenplay ruined the whole thing and what could've been a great movie easily became a ... Meh.Kong: Skull Island is packed with amazing monsters' fights, a beautiful CGI Kong and well-shot action scenes. However, the bland characters, the lazy script, full of exposition scenes and a surprisingly amount of just bad green-screen throughout the whole film drags what could've been a great blockbuster and turned it into a disappointment.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",5,1,1,6 August 2017
The Lion King," Rating: A+
","If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn't seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you're one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I'm just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don't really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven't notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!I rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That's how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can't simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia's tears. Mufasa's tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole 'remember who you are' speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer's score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.And I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It's one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an 'okay' scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a 'good' movie turn into a 'great' one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn't that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.During the stampede sequence, the score doesn't lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It's that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it's solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba's roar ... Damn it, I'm crying again!The animation is some of Disney's best. It's not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone's childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There's no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they're feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone's wallpaper even today.The songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, ... Every single song is someone's favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career's biggest role, Darth Vader isn't the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character's voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who's the 'bad guy', and that's unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.Nevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It's true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba's journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it's a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can't just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.It's a masterpiece! It doesn't matter if it's an animated film. It doesn't matter if it was 'made for kids'. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it's undeniably one of Disney's best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs ... The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its 'live-action' remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.",10,2,2,18 July 2019
Arrival," Rating: A+
","Brilliant. Is what I have to say after watching this movie twice. Nearly perfect, it has some really minor issues, but it is so freaking brilliant.Arrival is not a typical alien-invasion movie. If you're going with expectations of watching a human vs alien battle, forget it. This is a beautiful-looking suspenseful drama. Every single shot is filmed with such pitch-perfect pure beauty, Denis Villeneuve has been one of my favorites directors for the past years (Sicario, Prisoners, Enemy ... all movies from previous top10 lists of mine) and the cinematography in this one is just amazing. The first time the audience sees the spaceship up-close is a jaw-dropping long take, showing all of the surrounding space ... Gorgeous.The soundtrack also kept me so invested in the scenes, I love the tracks of when they're 'face-to-face' with the aliens. Amy Adams has definitely an Oscar-worthy performance, she's so subtle and simple, but I believed her so much. It's one of those castings where I can't see anyone else portraying her role, she's magnificent. Jeremy Renner is good, but he's not in the movie that much. He serves more as a device for us to understand better the third act revelation and not much more than that. Opposing to Amy's role, Renner is in this movie just because of his popularity. Even his character says that he's useless at some point in the film...Now, I knew that there was going to be a twist of some sort in the third act, but it didn't make a difference ... It's really awesome. It makes me rethink the whole film and that's the main reason why I needed to watch this movie a second time before reviewing it. The truth is that it's perfectly directed, there's isn't a single flaw relatively to its story and the final revelation it's so incredible that it is going to make you leave the theater extremely satisfied. I can't tell you much more than this without spoiling something.I can't really find important issues with this movie. I mean, Jeremy Renner's character is kind of put aside pretty strangely and the whole suspense around the 'what is their purpose?' is diluted maybe too fast, but that's not something I felt negatively affected by. The pacing might seem too slow, but if you know Villeneuve's work like I do and if you enjoy filmmaking quality like Arrival has, then everything is going to speed up a little. I actually think that the pacing improved during my second session. It's deliberately slow in order to give you time to think everything as you should, so I find this as a positive instead of a negative.Arrival is probably on my top5 list of alien-invasion of all-time. It's super intriguing, its story is fascinating, Amy Adams is so captivating with one of her best performances ever, Denis Villeneuve's direction proves to be perfect once again (one of my favorite directors of today, if not the favorite), the soundtrack is rememberable and the movie looks stunningly gorgeous, with beautiful cinematography. A deliberately slow pacing might bring the movie down for some people, but for me, it's right on point. A sci-fi masterpiece.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",10,0,5,6 August 2017
Parasite," Better late than never... Parasite is as brilliant as I've been told. One of 2019's best.
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm 'following the pack'. Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought 'this is too much, this would never occur'. Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.Technically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I 'should' or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...Rating: A+",10,6,12,16 February 2020
Halloween," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Even though everyone knows the story of Michael Myers, I'm still going to keep this spoiler-free since a lot of people might know this character without actually watching the movie. A lot of remakes, sequels, and spin-offs have been produced, but all of them are going to be retconned (thank God) in the direct sequel to the original coming out in the next few days. I couldn't be more hopeful...Halloween is a horror classic that inspired tons of slasher films, and its core story is still relevant to this day. John Carpenter and Debra Hill's screenplay cleverly explores the concept of pure evil and youth's ingenuity, by incorporating the former in the character of Myers and the latter on stereotypical teens, who only do drugs or have sex without a care in the world.Now, I do have to make this clear: this is a 70s movie. You can't watch a slasher film from 40 years ago with a 2018's mentality and knowledge of how movies are today. If you start to overthink stuff and really analyze this film without caring about when it was released, then you'll probably think this is one of the worst horror flicks ever. It isn't scary, it doesn't have huge set pieces or even well-developed characters ... for a 21st-century movie.Nowadays, we use the word 'cliche' a lot, especially in horror films, where silly jumpscares and characters who always make stupid decisions are trademarks. When Halloween came out, you couldn't really call its characters cliche since they weren't portrayed in hundreds of other movies yet. This film was one of the first to successfully use these formulaic characters. So, what made this movie so astonishingly famous and prominent? Besides its story, the mind-blowing direction and the addictive score.John Carpenter both directed and composed the music for this film, which is something extremely rare. I just finished rewatching this classic, and his soundtrack is not going to leave my brain for a while. It seamlessly switches the tones of the movie, and it elevates the suspense throughout the more tense scenes. Everytime a distinct part of the score plays, the audience knows that Myers has to be somewhere close, creating brilliant build-ups to dozens of fantastic moments.His direction is flawless. The way he plays with the background of every scene by changing the focus on a close-up or a wide shot is absolutely outstanding. The hand-held camera is excellently applied, and it helps to accompany the POV of the character, giving a better understanding of what he/she is actually seeing, hiding the potential scares and elevating once again the suspense.The story delivers so many remarkable characteristics that became timeless and eventually turned out to be cliches in films of today due to their excessive use. From the villain who is literally crazy and wants to murder people on Halloween night just for the sake of it to the ignorant and naive teenagers who don't care about a thing in the world and make the silliest decisions every single time, this Carpenter flick is one of the most influential horror movies of all-time.Additionally, they did all of this with an uncommonly low budget: 300,000$! This value was already considered low at the time, and it became one of the most profitable films of Hollywood to this date. They bought Myers' mask for one dollar! I mean, when I look at such a brilliantly directed and technically seamless movie like this, and then I find out that everything was made with this amount of money, I can't help but be utterly amazed.It's still not a perfect film. There are some cringe-worthy acting moments throughout the entire movie. Nancy Keys is hugely annoying as Annie and P.J. Soles is just appalling as Lynda. These two are hard to watch and listen to, even with a 70s' mindset. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) is fine, but since the characters' scripts are all over the place, hers provided some excruciatingly over-the-top screams. The only one who is able to deliver a good performance is Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis. He has the best lines in the entire film, and fortunately, he makes good use of them.I don't really have more issues to point out, but I do think that this movie lost a bit of its essence throughout the years. Its technical attributes aged well, but its scaryness didn't, and if you can't appreciate the rest with the right mentality, then this will not be a very entertaining time. However, if you do take into account everything and if you are able to change your millennial mindset to a 70s one, then you're in for a fun experience at home.Halloween (1978) became one of the most influential horror movies of all-time, and it's a classic of the genre, acknowledged and acclaimed by every fan of cinema. From the ground-breaking John Carpenter's direction to his own memorable score, every technical aspect of this film is jaw-dropping and aged surprisingly well. With a story that would literally inspire hundreds of other movies, it's an entertaining and suspenseful time that you should spend with your friends and family. Just be sure to change your mindset to the 70s and ignore some of its silliness. After all, it's Halloween!",8,0,0,26 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Rating: A-
","DC isn't going through a good time: Marvel keeps having huge success with most of both movies and TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) while the DCEU keeps giving the fans great disappointments since Man of Steel (including the latter) ... Well, Wonder Woman proves the hype was deserved and it's by far the best DC movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises!Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot. Remember these names because it's due to them that we finally have a phenomenal superhero movie with a strong female lead character.Â Gal Gadot is one of the best casting choices ever, she's one of those few people that make me feel like I can't watch any other actress portray the role ofÂ Wonder Woman. She elevated the movie in a way that I never thought an actor/actress could do, so it's easy to say that she's definitely the best achievement of the film.Chris Pine also gives a great performance and the amazing chemistry between him and Gadot makes me care a lot for the characters that are extremely well-developed in an excellent slow-paced first half of the movie, which is an unusual feature having in mind previous comic-to-movie adaptations. It proved very efficient because all that time spent with the main characters, learning about them and what they believe in, it all makes me really care about them so, when the battle arrives and they're in danger, it all feels way more emotional. THIS is what DC kept failing at: giving us characters under-developed, with no motivations whatsoever, put them in the middle of a fight and expect the fans to appreciate the excessive CGI and explosions.Patty Jenkins is a great director and this movie proves it: amazing COLORFUL visuals, the stories feel heartfelt and honest, the comedy is surprisingly great and the dialogue scenes, especially betweenÂ Diana andÂ Steve, are compelling and super captivating. The soundtrack is epic during the action scenes which are itself the definition of epicness. The first time that Wonder Woman goes into the battlefield (the one shown on the trailer) gave me chills all over my body, it's just E-P-I-C! Even if CGI is present in almost every single one of the action sequences, it's mostly well-used and it reached the awesomeness levels that I expected.The plot is simple, but efficient (even if implausible) and it still has a small not-that-obvious twist in the third act that's actually kind of cool.As for flaws, there's one that is common to every single comic-book movie ever: the villain. Once again, this character is weak (it's actually more than just one character), with no motivations besides 'destruction, yeah, war, yeah, let's kill everyone, yeah' and all of the clichÃ©s are put together into one big disappointment.The final battle is CGI-heavy and there were some brief moments where it almost looked like a video game, but due to the fact that I cared so much about the characters, this becomes just a minor issue that I didn't even get bothered with during the action. The slow- motion looked cool, but it got overused by the end of the movie. Finally, I think that the movie is a tiny bit too long, but I guess every superhero movie nowadays needs to have at least a 2-hour runtime or it's not worth it for the studios, apparently.So, Wonder Woman is, in fact, the savior that the DCEU needed and it not only proved the hype and huge anticipation something worth going through this last few months, but it surpassed everything I expected this movie to be. Thank you Patty Jenkins for the brilliant direction (visuals, character-development, action scenes, soundtrack, just everything), thank you Gal Gadot for your incredibly honest performance and thank you Chris Pine for being a perfect companion for the emotional journey you all took me through, even if with some flaws here and there (please, improve your villains DC and Marvel).<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,18,37,6 August 2017
Marriage Story," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't even know how to start this review... Marriage Story is one of those movies that stays with me long after I've finished it. I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas I've ever seen. That's due to the award-worthy performances of Adam Driver (Charlie Barber) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole Barber), but also because of Noah Baumbach's incredibly layered screenplay. In addition to this, Baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year. With the help of his DP, Robbie Ryan, he sets the platform for Driver and Johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are.Some people watch films to forget their daily issues. Some just want to have fun. Some want to learn more about a particular true story. However, there's not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater (or, in this case, their couch) entertained. Marriage Story has such an emotionally complicated premise that it's tough to convince people to sit and watch. I mean, who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours? Who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves? Yelling, fighting, court, custody, lawyers... It's not exactly an attention-grabber.I imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst. I'm writing this because I've seen some negativity towards people who simply don't want to watch Baumbach's depiction of a depressing event. It's perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one, especially if it hits too close to home. In my case, I've never gone through a divorce (hopefully, I'll never will), and usually I can 'enjoy' this type of sad, frustrating, bittersweet films (Manchester by the Sea, A Ghost Story) for what they are, no matter how tragic.If I had to choose one-word praise: realistic. There's no way around it. The palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well. Only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind can't understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate, and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they don't exactly mean. The exaggeration and over-the-top arguments are part of every couple's life. They can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress, work, accumulation of little things, or simply because it's just not a good day.Marriage Story doesn't deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because that's not what divorces are. It's not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love(d) for years without end, even more when there's a kid involved in the process. Baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness, but that's not something that happens during a situation like this. It's a heart-wrenching phase to live through, and I believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so.THE scene with Driver and Johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticism-wise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium. The raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive. Their chemistry is so inexplicably real. I never, not even for a single second, thought that I was watching fictional characters. Nicole and Charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family. Baumbach's use of long takes really elevate every single sequence, allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act.Technically, there's no better acting this year than what Driver and Johansson deliver. Both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines. Making dinner, drinking tea, going to the bathroom, chopping a carrot, blowing their nose, standing up, sitting down, walking around the room, crying, smiling, laughing... All of this in a single take! Several times!! Scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart, but Adam proves why he's the frontrunner at the 2019's Oscars. His restraint when Charlie is trying to be polite even though he's mad, or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go (excellent build-up), are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year.Not trying to diminish Johansson's display. Both deliver career-best performances, in my opinion. Both deserve every award that exists. The supporting cast is also impeccable, and I know that Laura Dern (Nora Fanshaw) is probably going to be nominated. Still, the two leads are so engaging and captivating that I couldn't be impressed with anyone else. The only person to rise to the main actors' level is Noah Baumbach himself. With the best screenplay of 2019, he offers the audience an incredibly complex story, filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue.He controls the movie's pacing beautifully, and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark, depressing mood. My only issue with the film has to do with its replay value. We all have been through this situation: watching a fantastic movie, only once, and never again. Marriage Story is going to be one of those films for me. I love everything about it, but I know the chances of a rewatch are very, very small. It's a profoundly unsettling story, super uncomfortable at times, and I really don't want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again.All in all, Noah Baumbach delivers what I believe to be its career-best flick, Marriage Story. With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019.

","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Black Panther is the last Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) entry before the highly expected Avengers: Infinity War and it tells the story of T'Challa's (Chadwick Boseman) rise to become King of Wakanda.Right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther returns to the isolated nation of Wakanda, but an old enemy reappears and the King's throne is put to the test. A conflict ensues and the fate of the whole world becomes in danger.Black Panther is one of my most anticipated films of this year (you can check the list HERE) and I couldn't wait to watch it on an IMAX theater. I loved Boseman's presence in Civil War and his action sequences were amazing, so I was super excited to see what his origin movie could bring to the MCU.Well, it is undoubtedly one of the best in the franchise and its place on the top one-third of the MCU is certainly guaranteed. It has a very heartfelt and culturally significant screenplay. This carries an even bigger weight than Wonder Woman did because for the first time in the cinema history, a film with not only a black lead superhero but with a 95% black cast (only two white characters), shines through with an emotional story.The script is remarkably well-written. It has a lot of references to the real world but in the opposite way: Wakanda is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world and for once, black people are not the ones falling behind. I love this aspect of the movie, Ryan Coogler cleverly portrays a world where things are not as everyone thinks they are. This film is demonstrative of how to flawlessly build a world in a cinematic universe.Also an example of perfection, the casting is phenomenal! Marvel never fails in getting the absolute best actors and actresses to portray their respective roles, either these being the lead hero or a secondary character. Everyone has terrific performances, but some are worth mentioning in detail.I will not even start with Boseman. Firstly, I have to write about Michael B. Jordan and his interpretation of the villain, Erik Killmonger. Jordan is incredible, there isn't a single scene where he doesn't shine and he elevates his character. That said, Killmonger is by far the best villain since the beginning of everything (Iron Man (2008)).His compelling journey makes the audience care for him and his beliefs are very true to his heart. He is what he thinks the people need him to be in order for everyone to be able to live freely and protected from the 'bad guys' running the world. His backstory is very tragic and it sets up a dilemma between him and T'Challa. Erik is notably well-developed and Coogler does a wonderful job co-writing him with Joe Robert Cole.Chadwick Boseman is right up there as well. He fully embodies his character, nailing the accent and making every interaction that he shares with his family or his close friends feel so realistic and full of emotion. T'Challa is an exceptional protagonist, it is easy to stand behind him since his motivations are genuine and passionate. He wants the best for his people and he wants to be an even better King than his father, by trying to correct his past mistakes.I don't even consider T'Challa and Killmonger as the hero and the villain, respectively. Each character has their own perspective and their reasons are both solid, so when the time for their head-to-head comes, I can't really choose a side. Coogler and Cole brilliantly write the characters' script and each one has their own reasons to support either Boseman or Jordan's characters. This is why this movie probably has the best characters in the whole MCU.Lupita Nyong'o beautifully portrays Nakia, a warrior that doesn't rely on tradition that much as she also wants to see the poor people around the world with a better quality of life. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is a badass and her character is also very well-developed, plus she has some cool action sequences. I also would like to congratulate Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue) for his excellent over-the-top performance, as well as Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi), Letitia Wright (super funny as Shuri) and Martin Freeman (Everett K. Ross).Actually, Ross was one of the characters that I left the theater wondering if he was really necessary. Being the only white person in Wakanda, I took a while to fully understand his role. Truthfully, he doesn't introduce or helps to develop any other character and he only has one or two scenes to shine. However, he is important to the cultural value of the film! He is the personification of the rest of the world, he thinks he is several steps ahead of T'Challa and his people, but Freeman ends up being the ignorant of Wakanda's greatness.Like I wrote earlier, this is one of the best installments of the MCU. Culturally, it means a lot and the story has a lot of substance. The cinematography looks gorgeous, the nation of Wakanda is very well designed through CGI and the editing is great throughout the whole runtime. The epic score is one of the highlights. A lot of praise has been given to Kendrick Lamar for the rap vibe that he implements in the movie, but nothing beats the African traditional sounds that elevate not only the action scenes but every single moment.Nevertheless, this film is not perfect. While its tone is well-balanced, its pacing not so much. The first act drags too much and it feels that some scenes could have been left out. From the first ritual battle onwards, the movie starts getting its pace right and the entertainment level gets higher. However, the plot follows a predictable path and it ends up on a disappointing note ... Coogler doesn't do good directing the most important action scene.The CGI might be very good and it is indeed well-controlled during the film, but it is misused in the climactic fight at the end. I mean, the first ritual battle between T'Challa and (at the time) a random character is way more exciting and better filmed (good handling of the shaky cam and the water splashes effects are pretty cool) than the supposedly epic showdown with Killmonger. Leaving the theater disappointed with the fight is never a good sign, especially when there are so many awesome action moments during the film. Apart from this, a couple of exposition scenes could have been told in a better way, but these are all minor issues that I have with one of the best superhero movies in the most recent years.All in all, Black Panther lives up to the hype and it does not fail. With an extraordinary cast, Boseman and Jordan lead a very heartfelt and emotional story, filled with fantastic characters and beautiful world-building. Killmonger is the absolute standout as the best villain of the entire MCU, the script is on-point for every character and the plot is very well-written, even if it becomes predictable. Technically great, but not flawless. While the cinematography, the editing and mainly the score elevate the film, the first act's slow pacing and the extremely disappointing climactic battle between the two leads bring down the movie, ending it on a bittersweet note. Still, this is surely in the top one-third of the MCU and I can't wait for Avengers: Infinity War!",8,1,6,17 February 2018
Mother!," Rating: A-
","I'm seating here thinking 'how can I review this film without spoiling at least a small hint of what the plot really is?'. To be clear, the marketing for this movie isn't exactly honest, but I also don't think it's trying to be deceiving. It tries to be mysterious and to some viewers that might negatively affect them once they actually watch the film because mother! has NOTHING to do with whatever the trailers are selling.This is a film that's going to be discussed for years without end due to one of the most controversial, offensive and shocking screenplays of all-time. It's based on an extremely delicate theme and that's the reason why critics are either glorifying or destroying this movie, there isn't a middle term for mother!.As for myself, I truly think that Darren Aronofsky just produced a masterpiece. It deserves some Oscar's nominations, but I very much doubt that even Jennifer Lawrence is going to get one. The Academy is definitely going to ignore this film since it can easily bring a big group of protesters to start a whole new preconception. So, why do I side with the people that state that this is a great movie?Honestly, the story is told in such an unbelievably amazing way that it elevates everything else. Midway through the runtime, it's relatively easy to figure out where the film is heading and what it really is about. The subtleness in the details, the depth in the metaphors and the thought-provoking allegories makes this one of Aronofsky's best scripts.There isn't a single misplaced moment, everything has some sort of metaphorical meaning which brings a sense of mystery and uncertainty to every scene. His vision is quite dark, intense and sometimes (too) shocking, but it's fantastically realized. He directs the hell out of this movie: an excellent use of the camera (several long one- takes), a very suspenseful soundtrack and a beautifully edited third act, that show all of his perspectives on some thrilling and unbreathable  25- 30 minutes.I'm not going to say that for you to love this film you have to share the same opinion as of the director, but it does help if you at least understand his way of thinking. I'm not going to lie, I pretty much share the same vision when it comes to the evolution of the theme that he explores. However, that doesn't mean that some scenes are stretched too far because they are indeed super powerful and shocking, but I think that's Aronofsky letting his rage and anger flow in the screenplay.As for the rest of his work, the suspense is very well utilized, especially in the first two acts where there's still a general perception of a conventional horror/thriller genre. The characters are extremely well-developed due to his excellent writing that never breaks the first law of storytelling: 'never tell'. There isn't any expositional dialogue, in fact, there are some lines that are very profound and significant that I'll keep in mind for the next few days.There are only a few people left to mention, the ones that take the director's words into something more through their exquisite acting. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem have two Oscar-worthy performances that are probably going to be snubbed by The Academy.J-Law is at the top of her game and this movie proves it. The internet has been over-saturated with her appearance in every single film nowadays, but I think that's due to her quick, exponential growth in popularity. She's a wonderful actress and the multi- layered amount of emotion that she brings to her character is astonishing. It's a terrific, compelling and incredibly committed display that pushes her to the top contenders' list for the major awards.Javier Bardem also gives an excellent performance, even if it's his counterpart that catches the bigger chunk of screen time. Still, he shows a very powerful, crazy and passionate dedication to his role, something that definitely elevates his character. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer have supporting jobs and their chemistry seem both honest and sassy, which some people might find strange, but I thoroughly enjoyed their performances.Despite all of the incredible directing skills, there are still some issues. The second act's pacing seems unbalanced, especially in the slow parts where I honestly think the movie brings himself down a bit. In addition to this, the loud soundtrack mixed with some fast cuts convey a sense of convolution at times, even if it's meant to confuse the audience. However, I think most of this can be smoothed out with a second viewing.Still, this film isn't for everyone. It truly isn't. If I ever show this movie to my mom, she'll be terrified for the rest of her life. It's really intense and outrageously offensive, which connects to my bigger issue with the film: some scenes are simply not necessary. I mean, there are moments where I think that Aronofsky should have stopped writing for a second. I think his frustration took him to places in his mind that are far beyond any imagination and I didn't need to watch some gory stuff to understand his point of view.But, all in all, mother! leaves the director's mark all over the place. Aronofsky writes a screenplay that is going to be discussed for years and it's definitely one of the most divisive movies ever. His masterful directing and his subtle, metaphorical and meaningful writing, elevate an extremely thought-provoking, intense and shocking story, told in a never-seen perspective. Jennifer Lawrence has an Oscar-worthy performance, as Javier Bardem supports her brilliantly, but some scenes are just too much gory and unnecessary to defend the director's statement.<ul><li>MSB Reviews: follow my blog if you enjoyed my review! :)</li></ul>",8,3,12,1 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Rating: C
","Starting with the actors:  Ben Affleck was amazing! He killed it as Bruce Wayne / Batman! Every single scene with him was pure entertainment and I bet he shut down all the critics with this amazing performance! As Bruce Wayne, he was compelling, interesting, I cared about him, and I understood his reasons for hating Superman. As Batman he was a bad-ass, probably the best-looking Batman that we've seen so far and I can't wait for his solo movie. Congrats Ben!Henry Cavill as Superman was fine, nothing special, he served his character well. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was a pleasant surprise, I was really happy to see her in this movie and she was great, even if only for some brief moments. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor ... I don't think he was bad, but he was definitely not good. He tried to go for that insane personality and it didn't work out, but he was still very good on some scenes. He was OK, I guess.The fight was incredible! I loved it! All of the action in this film was fantastic which proves that, even if a movie is amazingly good- looking, ... It can also be a total disaster.Zack Snyder seems unable to tell a story, there are a lot of problems with missing pieces here and there to justify most of the actions that are fundamental to the film. There are things that just don't make sense, the second half of the movie felt like I was watching a different film! Lois Lane is treated like an object. She has something, then she loses it, then she has to go back for it, then she falls from a building, then she's drowning ... She's, without a doubt, a character that needs to be in this movie, but it seemed she was there just ... Because.Another problem I had with this film was the lazy set-up done to the Justice League movie: there's a scene where Wonder Woman receives an e-mail from Batman, with info on this other superheroes that will be part of this group we all know about (they even designed the logos of each superhero! WHY? Who gave himself the trouble to design some logos for a top-secret association? ON AN E-MAIL?!). It's so forced, it's the lamest set-up ever done ... It seemed like the movie stopped for advertising and then came back to continue its story, it didn't make any sense.There are two main issues that I still need to discuss, one of them is my only problem with Batman in the whole movie: HE IS KILLING EVERYONE! Why?! He's killing people all over the place, exploding them against trucks or shooting them with a machine gun! Zack Snyder completely forgot Batman's moral dilemma, he was always that guy that was on the edge, but would never dare to cross it. The Joker played with him so much because Batman constantly refused to kill him, he was not a murderer! In this movie, he has no problem with it and there's no explanation throughout the whole film. Of course, I know why he changed, we all know why (Superman killed a lot of people and there's also other arcs from comic books that explain this), but they never show a scene to justify his actions.The other one is about the ending (no spoilers of course): they go for the bold ending and then ... They back off. It's not something that people will talk about, but it messed with me because this movie had everything to be an awesome piece of art. It wasn't because they didn't take the right decisions when they needed to and they didn't give a backstory or a justification when it was mandatory.There were a few more problems about Superman's motive to fight Batman and some other details that were solved or improved in some way in the extended edition, but I have to say that, even if it wasn't a bad movie, I was disappointed by it (especially with all the hype before its release).<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",5,0,3,6 August 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Love it for the exact same reasons some hate it!
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Taika Waititi delivers one of those films I absolutely love for the exact same reasons some people deeply hate it. His seamless balance between comedy and war drama makes Jojo Rabbit a thought-provoking yet hilarious depiction of how ridiculous Hitler's followers were. Roman Griffin Davis offers one of the best young performances of the millenium, and the rest of the cast is pitch-perfect. There's a lot of laughs, but also a lot of heart. Still, be warned: if you're easily offended, this movie isn't suited for you. Either go in with an open mind or don't go in.Rating: A-",8,1,2,5 February 2020
Midway," Rating: C+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)With all due respect to Roland Emmerich and to his fantastic Independence Day, his movies never quite reach their potential, ending up in constant disappointments. It doesn't matter if he has excellent casts or amazing VFX teams, his films' screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues. Midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns. Without knowing the director, anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated. From the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals, it has two attention-grabber ingredients, which can result in a remarkable film... only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough: story and characters.These are the main issue with Emmerich's movies. His characters are not compelling or intriguing enough, and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement (whether these are written by him or someone else). When I noticed that Midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the Battle of Midway, I immediately got excited. War epics are a genre that I sincerely appreciate. However, when I checked who was 'running the show', I instantly lowered my expectations. Honestly, it's exactly what I expected it to be: visually gripping, but emotionally hollow.I don't want to understate it. The CGI work in this film is jaw-dropping. The actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design. Even at a regular screening with the usual 7.1 Dolby surround speakers, the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes. This is why I think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie. Maybe not a vast majority, but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment. It has a long runtime, and it's hard to get through the exposition-heavy story, but in the end, I bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up.Nevertheless, it's still a very superficial flick. While it's very respectful to everyone who fought in the war (including the Japanese) and to the historic event on itself, it lacks emotional attachment to its characters. Dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world, but its main criticism connects to what I just wrote. Christopher Nolan's film also didn't have any compelling characters. However, there's a big difference between these two movies. Both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct. Dunkirk was all about showing the actual war. It never marketed itself as a character-study or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there. Nolan repeated several times: it's about the war and the war only.It's genuinely one of the best, if not the best, *pure* war film I've ever seen. When it comes to depicting the claustrophobic, unbreathable, restless, bloody, loud event that a devastating war is, Dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair (at least, I did in IMAX). On the other hand, Midway's marketing was about paying homage to 'people who fought in the Battle of Midway'. Hence the stellar cast compared to Nolan's just competent actors (with obvious exceptions like Mark Rylance or Tom Hardy). It spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle, not with the action itself. Therefore, these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs.Wes Tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic. Characters discuss specific topics that don't make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place. Throughout the runtime, there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story, which ends up turning the narrative confusing, convoluted, and lacking faster pacing. It's tough to get through the non-action periods, and I can't even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast. Ed Skrein remarkably portrays Dick Best, the only character who's genuinely compelling and carries a complete, well-developed arc.Unfortunately, I didn't feel invested in any other character. Only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role. Midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell. In addition to this, it has to stretch its runtime because you can't get Woody Harrelson or Dennis Quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines. As time goes by, Emmerich's storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow. It's yet another film added to the 'wasted potential' list...Potential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be. It's undeniable that these are entertaining, gripping, and exciting. The dive bombers' scenes are packed with so much tension that I was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target, and a bomb went into the sea. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary. Midway's war is as close to epic as it could be, but as with every other cinematic production, if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action, there are no outstanding VFX that can save a lousy screenplay.All in all, Midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the Battle of Midway, but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters. With more characters that what it needed, the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didn't have more than a couple of lines. Roland Emmerich has to thank his VFX team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle. Truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences, plus a powerful sound design, get your teeth biting the nails. Unfortunately, except for Ed Skrein's character, I didn't feel invested enough to appreciate the non-action moments due to the confusing, convoluted, and exposition-heavy narrative. It's a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story. However, I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and 'based on a true story' adaptations.PS: it doesn't hurt to research a bit about the Battle of Midway. I didn't and I'm sort of regretting that now. Don't make the same mistake. Going in with basic knowledge of what, how, and why it happened will only help you enjoy this movie more.",5,5,19,8 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) was just released, but my time didn't yet allow me to watch it. However, I do have time to review the film that started this new trilogy: The Force Awakens. At the time, it was my most anticipated movie of the year and I placed it second on the list of my favorite films of 2015 (just a bit below Mad Max: Fury Road).So, yes, I do love this movie and it is definitely on the top3 of the saga! The cast choices are the undoubtful proof of the huge success that this film achieved. Daisy Ridley (Rey) is a massive discovery, her talent is limitless and she embraces her role like no other. She delivers a very emotional and powerful display, showing all of her acting skills. I can feel that she is 100% committed to her character and what a character to portray at your first big movie appearance.Rey is excellently-developed throughout the film, she might mislead people into thinking she is just a mere scavenger, but once the movie gets going, she becomes an awesome character sharing some of the most epic moments in the whole runtime. She has an oddly mysterious backstory, which is going to produce theories and plot twists that I can't wait for, in the next films.John Boyega (Finn) is a fantastic supporting actor and another great casting. He brings just the right amount of humor with some exceptionally delivered lines and his facial expressions and timing are perfect. Finn is going to be one of the audience's favorites for sure, his journey to encounter Rey is interesting and unique in the saga. In my opinion, it is his story that carries the beginning of the movie and that sets up a lot of characters and plot points.Adam Driver as Kylo Ren ... Oh. My. God. What a performance! Driver is so subtle in the most meaningful moments but so compelling in the most menacing ones. He elevates Ren into a phenomenal antagonist with a splendidly written script. J.J. Abrams and co. do a wonderful job writing both the plot and the characters. Kylo Ren stands out, he is a multi-layered character with so much untold and hidden behind his personality and intriguing past. Once again, there are many theories and plot twists ahead that I'm drooling to know which one they are going to follow with.Oscar Isaac is very exciting as Poe Dameron, another fabulous addition to the franchise. His character creates an honest bond with Finn and their interactions are pretty cool. They share some amazing scenes and Poe has all of the awesome X-Wing fights, which are outstanding. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) does not show up that much, but he definitely is a very threatening presence and a very well achieved motion capture work.As for the original cast/characters, Harrison Ford has one of his best performances in the more recent years. Han Solo is one of his most popular characters and he portrays him flawlessly. Carrie Fisher returns as Leia and she offers a touch of reality to all of this. Every time she is on screen, everything becomes more realistic and tangible due to her graceful and humble display. Chewbacca has the usual funny 'dialogues' with Solo and some glorious action set pieces.BB-8 is what people feared the most since he could easily be annoying or irrelevant. Thankfully, he is another checkbox on the list of marvelous additions to the Star Wars universe. It is mind-blowing how a droid can provide so much laughter and terrific action scenes, he is unquestionably a toy worth spending your money on for Christmas. C-3PO also appears and elevates the level of nostalgia that everyone is already full of.Moving to the technical aspects of the film, J.J. Abrams proves himself to every single person that doubted him since he is the main reason why this movie is one of the greats. From the seamless editing to the great camera work during the impressive action sequences, he enhances the story so much with his distinct use of visual storytelling. It feels like a real film and not just a Star Wars typical movie.The visual effects are top notch and the cinematography could not be better due to the unbelievable practical backgrounds. Abrams uses a lot of long, wide shots with beautiful landscapes and mostly everything is real (besides the obvious, there is very few CGI, less than you probably think), which transforms every scene, every shot, into something more special. The tone is very well balanced between comedy and action, the storytelling process is astonishingly well handled and the pacing always maintains the tremendous excitement.One of the common issues of all Star Wars films are the excessive exposition scenes. Well, J.J. massively improves on that aspect having just a couple of them and I am counting the traditional text that starts the movie. Like I said above, there is an extensive use of visual storytelling, in other words, everything that you see is giving you information while advancing the plot without actually literally telling you what is going on or what is going to happen.John Williams' score continues to superbly accompany every scene, not only the action ones, but it also strengthens dialogues. I love the ending, but here is where both fans and critics are going to become very divisive. It ends with a huge cliffhanger and some people are going to be disappointed because they are left with this feeling of unfulfillment and if you don't know how to deal with it, you might think you didn't enjoy the film.The truth is you can't have everything right now. This is a trilogy, so it is absurd to even expect that you are going to have everything that you wish for in the first movie of a new era. I wanted more from the second the film finished, I also felt a bit let down because the movie concludes with something I had been expecting forever. However, this is a great feeling to have because it means the film meant something, it means the movie was so amazing that I just can't wait anymore for the next one!Nevertheless, The Force Awakens can't escape some minor flaws. While pretty much every single character is great, Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) is not. With so much practical effects surrounding every environment, a 100% CGI character is going to (negatively) standout. Besides, the whole subplot involving meeting with Maz feels a bit unnecessary and the story could have easily progressed without her.However, my main issue with this film is its lack of originality when it comes to creating a new actual danger for the galaxy. I mean, the Starkiller Base is essentially another Death Star, just bigger ... Really? They couldn't figure out anything else besides another giant planet destroyer? It does not reflect J.J. Abrams' incredible direction and the production team's excellent work, at all.Finally, there are some 'problems' that I don't yet know if they are, in fact, problems. This is the first movie of the trilogy and some things happened that I don't know how or why they did, so I can't really fault the screenplay ... yet. We all know the huge plot device that Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) supposedly had for decades, but then Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was released and brilliantly solved what was already considered an internet meme.This film does not have such a massive plot device, but there is one little moment that occurs in the first act that I still don't know if it is, in fact, a flaw or if there is an explanation waiting for us in the next movies.All in all, The Force Awakens proves that the Star Wars franchise is still, very much, alive! This is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise. It features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members. Incredibly-developed characters carry this movie with the help of a mysterious and captivating screenplay, as well as a lot of visually exciting action sequences. J.J. Abrams has his stamp all over the film, with beautiful wide shots, massive practical effects, and exceptional use of visual storytelling. A cheap third Death Star and some very minor issues here and there don't allow the movie to shine flawlessly, but it is still freaking awesome! It undoubtedly belongs to my Top3, behind Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope.",9,1,7,24 December 2017
Life," Rating: B+
","I have a soft spot for claustrophobic thrillers, everything goes down in this tiny space and I can really feel the horror and chaos of the characters involved in the action. It's hard not to connect every movie with aliens on a spaceship to ... Alien. It's one of my all-time favorites and Life did get some inspiration off of it (which is by no means a flaw!).The premise is interesting enough and actually more 'realistic' than other alien movies: they retrieve some evidence and study it, stimulating it in order for it to come to life (no pun intended). Then, as the creature evolves, it wants to defend itself, it wants to survive, so it's not as in Alien where there are spaceships with eggs and all of the beasts just want to kill everyone.It's a beautifully-shot film. It's really a CGI masterpiece, every scene is shot with great quality, an excellent fluidity of cuts and a fast pacing, but without under-developing the characters (with the exception of one, I'll discuss that below). Besides a very solid cast with excellent performances, there are also well-developed characters: everyone has their own past and reasons to be up there and all of them are explained through extremely needed character- development scenes. This is a hour-and-a-half film, with a pretty fast pacing, so I was positively surprised that I was able to care for every character.However, Jake Gyllenhaal's character (Dr. David Jordan) was under- developed, which I don't really understand since he's basically the star of this movie (Ryan Reynolds isn't in it as much as I thought he would be). It's not like his performance was below average (actually, he was really great, as always), it's just that his character was the only one that didn't get an emotional past or a good motivation to be in the ISI.I love the creature, it's another CGI beauty, even if it isn't as scary as it should. Nevertheless, it does prove why Life is rated R ... Which I didn't know as I entered the theater, so I was pretty much satisfied with the gruesome and bloody scenes. Even so, this isn't the best movie ever doing this type of scenes, so it's not like something I've never seen before.My main issue with this movie is the third act, which kind of messes with the creature's motivations. It goes from 'I just want to survive, don't threaten me' to 'I'll kill you on sight', which isn't properly a contradiction, but the way they did it at the end didn't connect the last act's tone that well with the previous two acts. Mentioning the end, by the way ... It is predictable, I'll not discuss that. However, by being predictable, doesn't mean it's bad, it can actually be pretty satisfying if done right and I think it was. I really enjoy the ending, it's well-shot enough for me to put aside its predictability.Life is yet another 'alien on a spaceship' movie, but it's able to have a more 'realistic' premise. It's beautifully shot, the pacing is fast and the CGI is used masterfully. With a very solid cast and great performances come also well-developed characters, even if Jake Gyllenhaal's (who has another great performance to add to his amazing achievements) didn't get a past or motivations as good as the others. The suspense and horror prove right the 'rated R', but it's not like we haven't seen this before (Alien ...). The creature is menacing at times and smart, despite the third act's tone messed its motivations.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",8,2,6,6 August 2017
Deadpool," Rating: A+
","We've seen this character before and it didn't go well (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), so I didn't know exactly what to expect from this movie. Actually, this was probably the superhero that I knew the less, I didn't know exactly what his powers were or how was he created, but with all the (amazing) advertising for this film, I got excited ... I did some research before watching this movie, I went prepared and I have to say: I loved every single second! It was great, I got home and wanted to know everything about this character!The fact that this movie was released in February was already something different and unusual. It's perfectly aware of the enormous amount of superhero movies that we're getting, every couple of months we have a new superhero movie and, even if it's awesome to see our childhood heroes on the screen, the scripts start to be very similar and it can become unexciting.Deadpool's script is, by far, the best attribute of this movie. People come out of the theaters and they're all excited about all the action and how cool the fight scenes were (like in all of the superhero movies nowadays), but the script is phenomenal! It's super funny, rude, sarcastic and they didn't back off ... They had no problems saying things that we usually only think of and never say it out loud.They constantly break the fourth wall to remind us of the state that films are in today and that's brilliant. I love when Deadpool makes fun of his sewn mouth in the X-Men movie or of Ryan Reynolds failures throughout his career. He even makes fun of actors or movies that aren't from comic books, it's just awesome! Also, the opening credits scene it's amazing, one of the best this year for sure!Tim Miller's directing is pretty great: the movie is fast-paced, the action is well shot, without shaky-cam, and the CGI is perfectly used, especially with the character Colossus. Everything looks clear and fluid (few cuts), which proves that you don't need an enormous budget to make a really great-looking film.The only thing that could have destroyed this movie was, like most of the time, the love story. It could have been just a plot device, so Deadpool could save the love of his life, or it could make us not care that much about the relationship and Vanessa ... However, they handle this story like they handle the rest of the film, with sarcasm and rudeness, and that made this story so much better and entertaining.The acting is great, the soundtrack is amazing, the film was incredibly hilarious and Ryan Reynolds was born to portrait this character! Ed Skrein, who plays the villain in this movie, could have done something more to be more interesting, but he works well for the movie's plot and as Deadpool's revenge target, which was what this film needed him to be.Is this movie going to be nominated for a bunch of Oscars? No. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it the perfect Deadpool movie? For sure!<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",10,0,2,6 August 2017
Green Book," Rating: A+
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Living in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!With the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga's son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can't remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can't remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn't expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I'm watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.However, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.Nevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just 'good' if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.Ali doesn't come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He's definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.Technically, Farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do 'ok' with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.Finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don't care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen's speech about racism. I don't care if the family of Don Shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.Green Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...",10,22,40,24 January 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Rating: B-
","When someone spells the word 'sequel' my body starts shaking. I have so many problems with this type of movies that only exist to make money and not to actually be a good movie. Even if John Wick: Chapter 2 started as one of these films, it's able to break the curse and become a fairly good sequel.There's twice the action of the first one and it's twice as good. The hand-to-hand combat is amazing and if you've seen the behind- the-scenes videos that went viral, then you know how happy I was watching those one-take masterpieces. Keanu Reeves might be the best actor alive to actually do his own stunts. Even the cheesy script works for him because ... Well, he's f*cking Keanu Reeves!I also loved the exploration of the assassin's institution. Throughout the second act, it's shown several 'safe houses' and rules by which the killers live by. The pacing drops down, which is a problem, but it's mostly fine since the story is interesting enough for us to be captivated. Just not enough for a whole second act about it.However, the first film is far better than this one. John Wick was a big surprise in 2014, no one thought it would be any good, so a lot of the scenes were great because we're not expecting them. John Wick: Chapter 2 has those same scenes and it doesn't have the same impact (it made me yawn at some points).The motivation for John Wick to go back to business is forced and not emotional (as it was in the first film), which I can accept ... Until the end. The ending doesn't make any sense to me, it's only done this way in order to have a trilogy. Keanu Reeves' character changes his personality and his whole attachment to emotions because ... Well, because the studio wants three movies.The script is super cheesy and it could have ruined the movie if not for Keanu Reeves' brilliant acting. The work that he puts into this character shows up on the screen and I felt it. He carried this whole thing. The rest of the cast did their job pretty well, with major praise to Laurence Fishburne, he's just great.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a good movie. It has those brutal, man-to-man one-take action scenes that blow my mind every single time. The story around the institution is interesting to some point, but the slow pacing throughout it took me off a little. The script is cheesy, but Keanu Reeves' makes it work. I don't buy the ending, it's only that way in order to have a trilogy and John Wick's motivations to come back are too forced and not as emotional as the first time, which contradicts the character's personality.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",6,1,1,6 August 2017
Annihilation," Rating: B+
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Alex Garland brings us the movie adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, which tells the story of an expedition team who goes inside The Shimmer, a strange disaster zone that is expanding each day that goes by and it is threatening life on the planet.Natalie Portman (Lena) leads with the help of an all-female supporting cast, plus Oscar Isaac (Kane).Annihilation is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2018 and I didn't really enjoy the fact that it was released on Netflix. The producers said that the film is 'too intellectual' for mainstream audiences and even though I don't (entirely) disagree, Garland made this movie for the big screen. I feel disappointed that I didn't watch this sci-fi story in a movie theater and I think films like this should be supported instead of just throwing them into a poor-quality screen.There are two main reasons why this movie should have been released wide in movie theaters: its visual effects and its score. Visually, this film floored me. It is always mind-blowing when a movie is able to create something never seen before and Annihilation does it. Everything feels astonishingly imaginative and unique. It is a whole other world inside The Shimmer and I can feel it just by looking at it, every single shot heavily drops visual beauty with its colorful and eyegasmic cinematography.The special effects are undeniably innovative and wonderful. Additionally, the score is also extremely addictive. It starts with an acoustic vibe and it gradually 'mutates' itself when our characters go inside the mysterious zone. It not only supports the story but it elevates the suspense and tension levels, giving it a very cool sci-fi mood. It is so exceptional that I can't stop listening to it (guess what I am also doing while writing this review).Some sci-fi films have their story carried entirely by the characters. They are the reason why those movies are good or bad. Alex Garland writes such a captivating and intriguing premise that the characters are almost secondary to the screenplay. Even though the slow pacing drags the film too much during the second act, the main premise is so damn interesting that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.Every scene has a purpose. Every apparently random shot of a tree or of an animal, every line of dialogue ... There are so many metaphors and very superficial plot details which make the viewers think. I understand why the producers said that the movie was 'too intellectual' for the general audience, this is not a film which you can leave the theater and that's it, it is over.You have to think through it. You have to be focused and open-minded to understand the bigger picture. The premise might be too scientific for some people (it is based on science notions that I don't think most people have) and that is definitely something the producers had in mind when Netflix arrived on the table of alternatives. I think it is a very smart concept and it is executed in the most fascinating and creepy way possible. However, the screenplay is also part of my issues with the movie.I am going to be as vague as possible to not spoil anything. Garland does an overall great job: good camera work, the exposition scenes are well-written and the editing is seamless. Nevertheless, he chooses to build a narrative around Lena in a way that takes away any sense of urgency and it turns every character's path very predictable. Even though I am always on my back foot regarding sci-fi films which always carry a twist of some sorts, each character has a pretty obvious storyline.From the moment the second act kicks in, I know that the movie is going to follow a certain route regarding the supporting characters and it never fades away from my expectations. The ending will be thought-provoking for some and it will be underwhelming (or overwhelming, depending on the viewer's mind) for others. For me, it is definitely an ending that needs some time to think but even after that, the expected payoff feels short for the slow-burn I had to go through.Genre-wise, it separates itself from the pack. It is not trying to copy anything, it is its own thing. I can't say I've seen any part of this film in some other work. It is very different, it follows an uncommon story filled with very puzzling plot points, elevating the movie's interest. It always feels new and innovative. Its tone is very well-balanced while its pacing could have been better controlled (I guess it really depends on how much the payoff compensates the rest of the film for you).I love ambiguity and contrary to The Cloverfield Paradox, this movie has a good amount of it without becoming overwhelming and confusing. This is a much-needed type of film nowadays, it is something people will keep discussing after its end due to its several interpretations, which only the great sci-fi movies are able to achieve. Truthfully, the more I think about the film the more I like it, but there are some minor plot details that are showed and never mentioned or explored again, which makes them feel unnecessary to the overall storyline.Finally, the cast and their characters. Natalie Portman brilliantly leads this movie and I am thrilled that she is able to effortlessly carry such a heavy one. She displays tons of emotions and delivers a seamless performance. Her character, Lena, is very compelling and exciting to follow. Her backstory and personality are the most developed and the team's chemistry is undeniably remarkable.Everyone has great performances, especially Gina Rodriguez (Anya Thorensen) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dr. Ventress). Both have standout moments where they shine, while the other two are part of my other major issue with the film. I couldn't care less about the supporting characters. Anya and Ventress have something more to them than the others, probably due to the actresses' excellent work, but all of them feel very depthless.Cass Sheppard (Tuva Novotny) and Josie Radek (Tessa Thompson) are just ... there. Cass helps to develop Lena and Josie serves to explain what is happening, so they become pure plot devices with no real personality. Oscar Isaac mysteriously portrays Kane, Lena's husband who means more to the story than the female supporting characters, even though he has a very short screentime. Basically, I only cared about Portman's character and having in mind that everyone else's path is pretty clear, this is a huge problem ...All in all, Annihilation is a thought-provoking, unique sci-fi movie, which does not stop after its end credits, generating a much-needed film discussion. The visuals effects are mind-blowing and the score is remarkably addictive, elevating an already amazingly imaginative and intriguing premise, which kept me captivated throughout the whole runtime. However, a strange narrative choice surrounding Portman's character (who she portrays flawlessly) plus an underwhelming payoff, break any sort of mystery surrounding the under-developed secondary characters and some minor plot details become unnecessary and unexplored. It is still a good job from Alex Garland, who is able to use his technical abilities to improve the movie's overall quality.",8,3,7,13 March 2018
Aladdin," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Aladdin is one of Disney's most adored classics, being the indisputable favorite of many, many fans. The Lion King will always have that spot in my heart, but I also visited this story set in Agrabah dozens of times. Now, with the 2019's remake about to premiere, I rewatched it last night and, once again, I fell in love. Honestly, I didn't remember how funny and entertaining it is! It still holds up incredibly well, even though the film was released almost 30 years ago. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it's the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of Disney's best.As it's known, Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography, as his career-best interpretation of an animated character. Genie is one of the most versatile figures of Disney and Williams spreads out his wings of creativeness and imagination, delivering a phenomenal voice performance of the hilarious blue entity. From his seamless imitations to the simple yet extremely difficult tone changes, he gives everything. Genie appears every time the film most needs him, which is when the pacing starts to drop and needs something to pump it back up while moving the plot forward. He could merely be a plot device, but thankfully the writers gave him an unique personality with his own motivations, making us not only laugh with him but genuinely care about his destiny.That's the other main attribute of this movie: its writing. The dialogues feel realistic, grounded, and there are no real exposition scenes, besides the musical sequences, which are also meant to serve that purpose. Aladdin and Jasmine lived utterly opposite lives, and both wish to change. Each wants the other's life experiences and adventures, which provides some amazing moments between these characters. I still wish their relationship had more time to develop (something I hope the remake will do), as well as Jafar's motivations. It's 1992, and it's an animated film, but the cliche villain who wants power because 'I'm the bad guy' never quite worked. However, the menacing and dark voice of John Freeman sells this character. In addition to these protagonists, Abu and Iago are two comedy sources that perfectly work, all the time.Musically, there is no way of denying the cultural impact that the Aladdin songs had. From Arabian Nights to A Whole New World, every song is filled with rich lyrics, great rhythm, and a beautiful tone. Not only are these able to develop the character or move the plot forward, but they also help the story never to break its fast pacing. Almost 30 years later, the animation quality still looks striking, and there are so many memorable backgrounds and visually outstanding settings. Disney's 90s decade is an absolute treasure in movie history: Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tarzan, Aladdin and a few more animated diamonds (in the rough) that went a bit under the radar.All of these will definitely get a live-action remake (some already have), and I welcome all of them. Stop trying to boycott something that will only help the new generations to fall in love with the same characters that we did. Live-action isn't here to offend our childhood or produce cheap copies of our favorite films! It isn't here to replace the originals but to honor them instead by delivering modern takes on stories that impacted us on a deep emotional level, and that will try to do the same for our children, grandsons and nephews. Are they going to be better than the source material? Worse? It doesn't really matter as long as they keep the original's essence and the traits that made us adore these unforgettable characters. And, please, stop the 'they're doing these remakes for money' argument. That can literally be said about every movie in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, entertainment is a business, it always was, and it always will be. Move on.All in all, Aladdin is a beautifully passionate story about how two incredibly different people with two completely different lifestyles can come to love each other by who they truly are. Robin Williams is a perfectly polished diamond and his scenes alone superbly elevate this film. One of Disney most impactful classics, filled with memorable songs, well-written characters, and stunning animation, which holds up remarkably still to this day. Despite some nitpicks regarding Jafar and the protagonists' relationship, Aladdin is undoubtedly an unbelievably precious gem which continues (and will continue) to be loved by newer generations all around the world.",9,0,0,23 May 2019
The Nice Guys," Rating: A+
","Shane Black wrote and directed this film and he did some great work. This is an unconventional and original comedy, with two amazing actors with great chemistry.Usually, in this type of movies, the main story is always the same: two different people, with totally different pasts and personalities, have to work together to solve some mystery and then end up being best friends. Not with this film. Both characters have a similar past (problems with alcohol) and they both have this funny personality that works perfectly when they're together. Gosling and Crowe really pull it off!Angourie Rice as Holly March is also really great, she played the 'side-kick' to all their missions and acted as the adult in that partnership. She sold it so well, even if she was just a kid, great job!And again, Shane Black's writing is incredible. I was crying of some much laughter, there were scenes that I still remember today because they were so well filmed and funny. I can't wait to watch this movie again! The action was a nice surprise, really well shot with some old film-making techniques. Actually, the whole movie was really well filmed, it looked like I was watching an old movie, but with better effects and all.The dialogues were great, the characters were super funny and the mystery was intriguing. In a time where we're over-saturated with superhero and sci-fi movies, this is a blessing, movies like this don't exist anymore. The ending was also really cool to watch, it's really a good story.Honestly, I'm excited to watch it again. It's that great.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",10,3,6,6 August 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Rating: A
","Wow. That's what I have to say about Hacksaw Ridge, one of the best war movies that I've seen in a long, long time ... Not only a great war film, but also a very profound, compelling and captivating story that turns into something even greater when I realize that it actually happened and that Doss actually is a national hero.I want to start with Mel Gibson as a director: stick to it, sir! I know that his name isn't properly associated with good things nowadays, but this masterpiece of filmmaking has to change the way people in Hollywood currently look to this underrated director. I actually think he's one of the best directors regarding the near- perfect use of the camera on war-type action scenes and the way he depicts every aspect of the horror, fright and bloodiness that a war has (just check Braveheart). Oscar-worthy directing!Andrew Garfield ... I'll just assume that the Amazing Spider-Man spoof was a misleading error and I'll absolve you from all that crap. Just stick to more serious and deep movies like this. Another Oscar nomination for Hacksaw Ridge, for sure! What felt a little cheesy at the beginning turned into such an inspiration later in the film, his inhuman belief carried not only himself, but the whole army through Okinawa and Garfield portrays that in such an emotional way ... What a performance!The supporting cast is also really great: Hugo Weaving (Tom Doss) is a good surprise, I didn't expect him to be as good as he was, Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell) and Sam Worthington (Captain Glover) have performances even more surprising! Everyone is at their top, portraying characters based on real heroes seems to inspire them in a way that makes the actors motivate themselves to inspire us, the audience. They're all just great and believable!It's a great movie, but I do have two minor issues with it, one with the first act and the other one with the last few minutes of the film. The first act's pacing is really slow and I totally understand that there are characters needing depth and personality, but I still think it's too long and that its not-so-smooth flow could've been far better. From the moment Doss goes to the training camp, that's when the film picks up and takes us to an awesome journey.Finally, at the end (without spoiling anything of course) the film shows some interviews with the real Desmond Doss and some other real movie characters, as any true story film usually has. My problem is not with that, but with what the director actually decides to end the movie with (aka, before the interviews). Mel Gibson decides that a 'reading path' is the best ending, but it felt like it ended the movie in a slightly abrupt way and without the characters that we just spent two hours with.But that's nothing!Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best war films that I've seen probably since Saving Private Ryan (better than Black Hawk Down, in my opinion). Mel Gibson's directing skills are to praise infinitely and Andrew Garfield's emotional performance puts him as a front-runner for an Oscar together with his director. Inspiring story, frightening awesome war scenes, beautifully shot (excellent use of the camera) and a great supporting cast as well. A slow-paced first act and a slightly abrupt 'reading ending' are nothing when we are discussing a 2h-long movie with such incredible characters.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",9,2,3,6 August 2017
Warcraft," Rating: B-
","First of all, I consider myself a gamer and I did play World Of Warcraft for a little bit, but never actually learned to enjoy the game as one should. I'll try my best to look at this with a critic's opinion instead of a biased player because that's what I'm here for ... To review movies and not games.I really wanted this movie to be a major blockbuster, the best video game adaptation ever because every other video game with desires to become a film were hinged on this one (and I really want an Assassin's Creed series). The truth is that this is not as bad as the critics say, but it's not perfect either. It has some really great moments, but also a lot of issues. Let me start with the things I liked ...Duncan Jones as the director: God, was he great! There are some visually stunning action scenes where you can really feel bones cracking and heads being smashed. This is a gorgeous looking movie, there's a lot of CGI (really, a lot), but it's mostly well incorporated, especially in the battle sequences and on the orcs' appearance. Furthermore, the score is so addictive that I'm actually listening to the main theme while writing this review ... It transformed good scenes into amazing sequences!Durotan (Toby Kebbell) was the Frostwolf clan's chieftain and the character that I cared the most (and probably the only one). He blamed Gul'dan for the destruction of their world, so he tries to form an alliance with the humans to save his race from further misery. He is, by far, the best character in the entire movie. Travis Fimmel was good portraying Anduin Lothar, the commander of the humans' forces and a character that I didn't quite connected with. He has a stupid, nonsense romance with another character throughout the movie and that didn't help his story at all. Actually, one of the things that bugged me the most were the human characters since I didn't really care for any of them! Still, another character I liked was Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), he was pretty cool and I think the film should have used him more.When all the budget is spent on visual effects and directing, something has to suffer ... And that's the pacing and some plot issues. Oh my God, the pacing! I understand that hardcore fans of the game were completely fine with the jumping around from location to location ... For about 15min. After that, it's impossible not to feel the abrupt and constant transitions that almost made me lose sight of where the story was. This film tried to tell us in a 2-hour runtime what can barely be done in a 10-episode TV series! It's ludicrous to believe that this much material would be able to fit perfectly in a movie of such short length.Additionally, there are some characters that are introduced to us, near the end of the film, that come out of nowhere and suddenly we have to deal with them and how relevant they happen to be. They're mentioned a couple of times in the movie, but for the importance that they had, they should've got a lot more screen time. Also, as I mentioned above, there's a romance that is awfully bad, it's one of those love stories that nowadays (for some reason) every movie seems to need one and that didn't help the party at all.These are only a couple of examples on how the pacing ruined what could've been a great movie. There's some good characters, excellent directing and visual effects, some amazing fan-service scenes (more than I could think of, for sure), but the pacing brought the movie down in an enormous way as well as the narrative problems.Warcraft is still a great entertainment, especially for fans of the game, who will probably love this movie just for the battle sequences alone, but as a whole ... It should've been a lot better.<ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>",6,1,2,6 August 2017
