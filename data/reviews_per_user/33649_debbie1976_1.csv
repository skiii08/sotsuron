United 93," A Harrowing Account of Reality...
","The film was not quite what I expected it to be. I expected a rather unnerving portrayal of what happened on the flight but I didn't think far enough ahead to actually realise that you would be shown in such graphic detail what the 4 men aboard that plane actually did. The violence was bad enough but it was the phone calls of the passengers to their loved ones before they died that did it. It was harrowing account of reality that was hard to watch.I think that the film was superb in the sense that you understood what the people were going through, but it's not one I will ever watch again. If the cinema had not been so busy, I would have left half way through as it made me feel thoroughly uncomfortable.",8,0,1,8 June 2006
