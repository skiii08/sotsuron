The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We accept the love we think we deserve
","I don't have the exactly words to describe what this movie really meant. It was one of those life changing movies and it reminded me so much of my own life, my experiences, desires and every other stuff I went through growing up.I really hope everybody to feel what I felt when I watched the movie for the first time, how it reminded me of myself and I'm pretty sure that every single person who watched the movie, at some point, felt the same way because this was the really intention of the author and of the amazing cast. Everything was perfect: the cast, the soundtrack (entirely well picked), the dialogues between each one of the characters were vibrant... I really could spent a lot of time writing about this amazing movieI really recommend the movie, the book as well, if you want to live the whole experience.",10,0,1,5 March 2014
