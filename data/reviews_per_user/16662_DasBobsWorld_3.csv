Hereditary," Here's To Family!
","Hereditary is an example of a movie you need to see during the hype train that existed at release. I feel like a movie that has been out for a while and is constantly getting praise leaves latecomers like myself in a bit of a wrong headspace going into a first watch. As it stands, Hereditary is a good film, with some interesting looks into family, and mental health wrapped neatly beneath a supernatural thriller. Did it melt my mind and slam me into the future of horror? No, but it was worth seeing.I am sure that most people have gone over the plot and such of this film. Also, the performance of Toni Collette is pretty damn near perfect. So, no need to talk about that. For me, Hereditary fell into a trap that a lot of the newer age 'horrors' do. Length. For some reason, it's very hard to tell a good thrilling story and keep it under 100 minutes, let alone 90. Watching long stares, seemingly unending scenes, as well as repetitive scenes which only seem to be running over ground we have already watched more than once are not really my jam. That being said, there are some amazing moments of shock, heartbreak, drama, and horror that can't be downplayed. Also, the death of Charlie came right out of left field and I found it refreshing to have a movie surprise me.As for the ending, I didn't really mind it, although it felt like it belonged in another film. For most of the run time, Hereditary seems like a family drama of a very intense nature. The horror coming from seeing a group of people fall on hardship and hanging on by a thread just to keep what's left of their sanity. Having it end like a bit like Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones doesn't really help tell that story.So, Hereditary is good. It is worth your time, even at its long length, and I do think it is deserving of most of the praise it is getting. But, I am also inclined to think that it might have effected a bit too much by the hype train. Still, an easy recommend.",7,2,3,19 February 2019
BlacKkKlansman," The Real Undercover Brother
","Sometimes I have no idea what to say about a film after watching it. Then after waiting until the next day, I can't figure it out either. My writing of this BlacKkKlansman review feels like that.I did really like this film, I am honestly surprised there are not more films like this being made in the heat of today's racially charged climate. Yet, while watching this film, which shows glimpses of powerful imagery, camaraderie, and evil, I found myself a bit detached from the emotional weight of this movie. In fact, I will say other than that real-life footage at the end of the film BlacKkKlansman felt like a bit of a let down at parts. To be fair, this issue is probably on me. I was expecting a film that was going to give me that sick stomach feeling that I got watching that end of movie real footage. Yet, I didn't. I did not want to see race violence to the extreme but I had expected it with the subject matter of this movie. There are scenes that are generally frightening, though they are mixed in with a lot of light-hearted moments, and sometimes they just took me out of the experience.Ugh, reading this back makes me feel like I am advocating for more violence, which I am not. I just felt like the emotional impact of this was lost a bit in the light-hearted moments. Also, Ron's white guy voice sounds like Eddie Giffin's white guy voice in Undercover Brother, which didn't help.Other than the mixed emotions of the tone, I have nothing to complain about. The casting, the direction, the story itself all works and as I said before I enjoyed it for the most part. I just felt a bit underwhelmed at times. Still, this is an easy recommend. There is a lot too it, and hopefully, you will enjoy it more than I did.",7,0,3,22 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Yup...it's Awesome
","As always I am late to the party with bigger release movies. I usually get to them and then complain about how the hype affects my viewing and blah blah blah. Then I watched Spider-Verse and damn...The hype was real!Music, color, story, tone, pacing...They all worked. A movie about a superhero I don't even really like, that's been origin storied to death and it is fantastic. Believe the hype! Of course, I may be the only person on the planet who hasn't seen this until now, and I'm sure the reviews all cover the amazingness of the film. Stand-outs for me include the main character Miles Morales. He is a breath of fresh air in the musty mist of Peter Parker origins. In fact, his story is light-hearted, dark, and engaging right from the beginning. Even with the distraction of other spider-peoples, I wanted to see more of him. I actually could have done with less spider-people to see more of him. I also enjoyed the use of color and music. Spider-Verse seems more like a tagged art piece than a regular marvel animated outing. Its splash of color is a really fun thing to behold in today's darker hero movies. I have very little to complain about...that's new to me.So, Spider-Verse is the first movie in a long time to live up to the hype for me. If you haven't seen this, then you are missing out. Also just won the Oscar for best animated film, totally deserved. Watch This!",9,2,4,5 March 2019
