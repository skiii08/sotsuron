Casablanca," A great classic that surely deserves a comeback
","Set against the exotic backdrop of French colonial Morocco, Casablanca combines the thrill of wartime espionage and conspiracy with a glamorous cast of international characters reflecting contemporary politics. This prestigious title is rightfully considered a classic among many critics; the excellent atmospheric shots and dialogue capture one's imagination and transports a viewer into it's characters' precarious circumstances. We follow American expat Rick Blane through a minefield of political drama and personal deceit as he navigates his way and makes his choices between assisting his former lover and her freedom-fighter husband, and a collaborating, corrupt official and his Nazi superiors. Morals and personal scores are pitted against each other in the dramatic arena of murder and mystery that is Casablanca.",10,2,2,27 September 2017
