It," Best Movie Of 2017.
","I recently went to see this movie after a few weeks of delay. Due to some family-friend issues, though, I was around 10-20 minutes late. However, what I saw was very good. Let me tell you about it:This movie is excellent. Its use of CGI combined with the lively acting makes for a satisfying and immersive movie experience, something I haven't seen in a long time. Their expressive reactions to Pennywise made me feel like I was a part of the Losers Club, experiencing it alongside the actors.The plot was also stable. The fat kid loads up on the town's history at the library, only to be greeted by Pennywise in the basement. Then blah blah blah, he gets bullied, red balloons, creepy house, the Sewers.Very good movie. Honestly, I enjoyed it and recommend it.",9,1,4,14 October 2017
