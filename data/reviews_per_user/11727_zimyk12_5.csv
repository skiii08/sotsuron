The Hangover," Mehhh...
","People have given it 10 stars. People have said its the funniest film they've seen. People are silly. Seriously though, i laughed at 1 bit and that was when the naked chinese guy jumped out the boot. I was expecting a lot more in terms in humour and storyline, sadly i was abit dissapointed.",4,0,1,6 August 2019
It," A very bad comedy.
","Well i've learnt that i cant even trust IMDb ratings anymore. Seriously??? Don't get sucked in with the high ratings. This movie was like a badly written comedy with absolutely nothing scary about it at all. A true horror fan like myself will be leaving the cinema disappointed. What i did like is the gore but apart from that i thought i was watching a spoof comedy horror film.How do a group of kids who get beat up by bullies manage to kill a child eating clown? OK, i give up. You'll float too. No thanks.",5,45,91,9 September 2017
Horrible Bosses," Better than most 'comedies' (incl the hangover)
",This was a great watch full of funny moments throughout and actually had a good storyline. I find that most comedy films have a pretty weak story but this wasn't the case here. The acting was pretty good from everybody involved and it was a comedy film that was actually funny...,8,0,1,7 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Why can't people just enjoy films anymore...
","This is a rating for the whole trilogy. Ok look, i was hoping that in the end rey would actually turn to the dark side i mean that would be some BADASS ending, apart from that all three films were entertaining to watch, emotional and all in all very enjoyable. Im a big star wars fan and honestly cant understand the stupidity from 'fans' people just love to moan and complain about every single thing these days. Grow up and enjoy things. Goodbye.",8,5,22,19 May 2020
Law Abiding Citizen," Sooo that ending...
","As soon as the film finished i was hoping people would share the same view as me, that the ending was absolutely BS. How many times does a films beginning and middle be near enough perfect only for the ending to ruin all that hard work. What do you think went through the writers heads?? Wouldve given this film an 8/10 if it wasnt for that.",5,0,0,18 August 2019
