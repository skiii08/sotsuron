Alien 3," Fincher made a much better sequel
",I think this movie is a much better sequel to the original than ALIENS. It shows us the alien as a creature superior to the human being (like in the first movie). In ALIENS this very important fact had been forgotten. There were hundreds of these creatures just to be killed in seconds. This movie shows the Alien as a silent and very intelligent killer. That´s why I was much more impressed by Alien³ than by ALIENS.,9,10,13,15 April 2002
The Thin Red Line," the better 'saving private ryan'
","i don´t know what people see in 'saving private ryan'. For me it is a bloodthirsty hollywood-typical movie that tries to show what war is like.But 'the thin red line' does this much better. The thoughts and feelings of the few men the movie concentrates on, are much more interesting than the gory beginning of 'saving private ryan'.You should watch this movie, and you´ll understand what I mean",Null,1,2,15 April 2002
