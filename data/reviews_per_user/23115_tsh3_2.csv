Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Much to enjoy if you ignore the hype.
","I liked this film. I genuinely thought it was cool. Being twenty years of age now, I grew up with the first three films, and they changed my life. If I was a child now, this movie would've made a difference to me. A lot of people have missed the point here. It's supposed to be a children's movie, but there's still much for adults to enjoy; The PodRace, the political shenanigans, the relationship between Qui-Gon and Shmi. I could go on, but there are so many great moments to enjoy. Ewan and particularly Liam are fine in their roles, and everyone does a pretty good job. Even the dialogue doesn't have you chewing your fists like 'Return of the Jedi' does. The self-parody, the set-pieces and the amazing effects make this a film to cherish. Take away all the hype, and you're left with one of the finest blockbusters of recent years.",10,0,1,3 April 2000
The Iron Giant," A joy from start to end
","I went in to see this film without expectations, and came away very pleasantly surprised. This enchanting family movie has all the right ingredients. It's funny, clever, well written, the characters are likeable, and there's an important message in there too. Though essentially about the relationship between the young boy and his robot friend, there are questions raised about the army, about war and the battle between good and evil.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and the ending is one of those rare things theses days. A genuine tear jerker.",9,0,1,3 April 2000
