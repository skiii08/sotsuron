Marie Antoinette," A disappointment
","Marie Antoinette holds such a strong story with a lot of laughter, drama and sorrow. Not once during the movie got I sucked into the story and believed what was going on. Not one laugh, not one tear. Every time the rock music played I got drawn out of the illusion that was build up since last time the rock music was played. It was a weird time-span of events, 3/4 of the film was spent on the dresses, cakes and Antoinettes troubles to seduce the husband. The last quarter of the time, spent on giving birth to three children, loosing a child, having a lover, and the beginning of the French Revolution. Emotionless effort! The setting and the costumes were of course great, that's why I gave this move a two... Another thing is how badly this movie is made technically. Even two-three times the microphone is dangling down in the picture... ohh, horrible! Just a big disappointment of what could have been such a great movie of such a dramatic character! Wish I was the daughter of a director and had funds, I would make the story that is really worth telling. Would also show how the ending is for Antoinette...",2,25,51,5 June 2006
