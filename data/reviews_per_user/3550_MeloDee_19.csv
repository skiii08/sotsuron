The Ring," Finally something that is actually scary.
","A lot of horror movies make three very common mistakes.Mistake #1: The suspenseful approach.With this approach, the filmmakers basically have a character- or characters- wander around in a decidedly 'creepy' location. The location is made 'creepy' by various, mysterious sounds, poor lighting, and ominous music. The ominous music and creepy sounds all slowly rise in volume until they reach a climax. We sit on the edge of our seats, waiting for something to happen. They tease us a little, having the character(s) jump at harmless shadows for a little while. Finally, the 'evil thing' comes out and gets somebody.The problem with this approach, is that they're not really scaring us. By forcing us to wait so long to see 'the evil thing' and by taking advantage of the natural reactions that occur in our brains when we hear certain sounds, they make us 'edgy.' Edginess does not constitute fear.Mistake #2: 'Let's startle them.' I guess some filmmakers started realizing that several viewers are now able to tell the difference between suspense and fear, so they've decided to try and startle us in the theaters. They cut the music, the lighting and the jumping at shadows. Now, they just have things pop out at us with nearly no warning.The entire audience gasps, and you might even hear a few shrieks here and there. I can almost see the filmmakers smiling triumphantly.The problem with this approach? Again, that's not fear- it's a natural human reaction to react violently at sudden, loud noises. So for a few minutes, we actually believe we are in danger, drawing us into the film- but then, soon enough the feeling vanishes.Mistake #3: They try to gross us out.This is an ages old mistake, and still hasn't been remedied. When all else fails, the filmmakers load their movie down with blood and gore.Too bad more of us aren't afflicted with hemophobia.Oh, and let's not forget the hideous, misshapen, occasionally-vomitting creatures. We turn away in horrified disgust. Of course, because I don't want to see some slimy, decaying thing ripping the head off a screaming victim I must be just terrified by your movie.That's not the only problem with that, though. It- like the first approach- has become predictable, as the more disgusting things they show us the more desensitized we become....Now you -probably- want to know what my whole point was, besides that I am immune to 'fear' so incorrectly named. My point really was that one movie rose above the sea of monotony and crowned itself king in the world of horror.That movie was The Ring.The movie starts off with showing us 'the film.' The film itself, instead of being overly gruesome, is instead rather mysterious, disturbing, and strange. This film inadvertently causes the death of Rachel (played by Naomi Watts)'s young niece. Yet even that death was done nicely. Though we do understand something ominous is going to happen, we don't understand what or why. This gives a sense of eeriness to the film that would not have been possible otherwise. In fact, they don't even actually show the young girl's death. They skip straight to the funeral, where we're given clues of the horror of the whole thing- yet we still have no idea what's going on.A favorite author said, 'There is nothing more powerful as what is left to the imagination.' The Ring proves this with increasing cleverness as the film goes on. Journalistic Rachel tries to discover what happened to the young girl. The only one who witnessed her death was confined in a mental institution- but we see that later.Meanwhile, Rachel goes to the place where her niece was the week before her death, after discovering that all of her friends that had been there died in the exact moment that she did. Rachel had heard about 'the film' from two acquaintances of her niece at the funeral, and decided to go to the cabin where it was located and watch it.After she watches it, she is visibly frightened. Then she receives that ominous phone call around which the film is based.'You have 7 days left to live.' So that is the core of the movie. Rachel tries to find out what the movie is about and what it is, at the same time trying to save her own life. Eerily, one the scenes in the movie become manifested in reality for everyday that passes. First, Rachel walks under a ladder. Next, as she's making a copy of the film for study purposes, the fly from the film becomes real. Next, nosebleeds- and it goes on and on.This is meanwhile building suspense as well as mystery, without utilizing the 'characters jumping at shadows' stereotype. To our surprise, also, it starts to frighten us.Fear...that ominous pain that fills our stomachs at the thought of the unknown; that shiver in your skin. For me, it's not manifested by seeing hideous things, perhaps more suited to scaring a young child than a well-informed adult (or adolescent). For me, it is an intellectual experience. The more the fear makes sense or feels 'real' the more afraid we feel inside. The Ring forces us to use our imagination again, to think beyond what we are used to experiencing. It touches the fear inside us all.In order for a movie to feel scary, it must haunt me long after the pictures have finished showing. The Ring does that excellently, by forcing us to watch the movie Rachel does before the actual movie starts. We see what she has seen, and so, we fear that what she has feared may come upon us.To this day, when a fly flies near any electronic screen- whether computer or television- I cannot suppress a shudder.",9,1,2,15 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Why have I been reviewing all of the part twos?
","That will remain a (partial) mystery. Why this movie was not as good as the first, however, will not be.The movie was just a little too 'goofy' for my tastes, in that typical Disney fashion. It failed to balance comedic silliness with seriousness as well as its predecessor.Secondly, for the first time, I started to truly dislike Will's overly virtuous character and his often ill-timed showings of bravado. Whether the fault lies primarily with Orlando Bloom or his character is unknown, but I felt that Bloom's performances were a little too wooden this time around. In addition, Will's oft-brash behavior seems to lack consequences. When you see his run-ins with the villain of this movie, a squid-like version of Davey Jones, you will understand my sentiments.In general, Davey Jones was a 'suitable' villain for the second film, being neither perfect nor absolutely terrible. I feel that Barbossa from the original movie was more balanced and fun. He was a 'bad' guy who wasn't exactly bad, thus providing ample excuse for his lack of cruelty. Davey Jones, on the other hand, is heartless- in the full literal sense if you get what I mean- and because of this, the writers are forced to give him some out of character moments to prevent him from killing Will. He's also paired with the typical idiotic crew, perfect for holding back the otherwise unstoppable villain enough to allow the heroes juuussst the wiggle room they need to escape all the disastrous situations they seem to get into. The writers also saved Davey Jones from total character-suicide by making him have a curse (which was never explained) that prevents him from getting on land, or even within 10 feet of the shallows. This means he is forced to depend on the aforementioned stupid crew, rather than be stupid himself.The plot of this movie was at least as good as the original, with even more twists, and the much-welcomed reappearance of a two very specific characters from the first film. The major problem with judging the plot, however, is that we don't even get to see how it all ends! This movie follows a trend set by the first two Lord of the Rings, ending exactly where the first film is going to start off with no warning whatsoever. I found this a little disappointing- especially since I embarrassingly didn't know about the third one for some reason when I was watching the second. Still, it wasn't enough of a pain in the butt for me to detract any points from the film's rating.If you feel like I haven't said very many good things about the movie, well, keep reading- that's coming. Then right after that, a few more bad things, then my conclusion.The good news is this; that wonderfully piratey theme song that gave the first Pirates a lot of its appeal is back in full force. The stunts and choreography in the film are still as amazing and tasteful as in the first- if you detract the few goofy ones close to the beginning of the film. Jack Sparrow is as witty, endearing, and as drunk as ever. Elizabeth, still gorgeous and kick-ass without being annoyingly pro-girl-power, is taking an even bigger role in this movie than in the first one. I for one do not mind.In fact, one of my favorite scenes in the movie was Elizabeth and Jack's discussion about 'curiosity'. I think Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly stole the entire show and left Orlando Bloom standing in the dust.Good news aside, I am now free to address the one scene in this movie that left me grinning in a combination of embarrassment, annoyance, and amusement.I was proud of Pirates of the Caribbean for introducing its own unique flavor, spirit, or whatever it is you choose to call it into theaters and DVD shelves everywhere. This is why I wondered exactly why they chose- like Superman Returns, V for Vendetta, the One, and other films that I cannot at this moment recall- to incorporate Matrix-like effects into their movie. In just the film where I thought that I was safe from incredibly slow-moving flying bullets, they sneak one in.Sure, it was well timed, and it was just one bullet. There were no slow kicks or time-defying dodging of sword thrusts and/or punches in the film. Still, it was just a little over the top, and worthy of detracting a tiny fraction of a point.Well, despite all, I still loved the film, I still recommend the film, and I still desperately want to see the last? installment.",8,0,2,31 January 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Better than I ever imagined.
","I absolutely LOVED this movie- I have not been able to say that in a long while. As soon as it started, the environment, music- everything about it easily lulled me into a deep nostalgic peace. My favorite character was little Lucy. Georgie Henley acted absolutely brilliantly, and so did Skander Keynes (Edmund).Sometimes the Christian undertones of the movie are a little more evident in some places than others, but to avoid spoilers in this review I will not expand on that thought. (though, griffins and phoenixes definitely wouldn't be Christian symbols- at least I doubt it) The only reason this movie escaped a 10, was because of what I considered some moments of cheesiness/choppiness within the main battle. It seemed to go slowly sometimes and it seemed there should've been more attack directed on the main characters (you would need to see the film to understand).Aside from that, this movie is perfect, both for the young and the young at heart.Having seen both the Lord of the Rings and Narnia, I'm going to say that LOTR is probably a more 'serious' or 'mature' film. Both, however, do have a central theme of the main character(s) having to take up a burden that at many times seems too heavy. The similarity, however, ends right there, and any comparisons to battles, plot, etc., are unfair to make.",9,0,0,9 April 2006
The Notebook," Pretty good for a romance film.
","I'm definitely not an expert on romance movies, because I tend to generally avoid the romance genre- in both films and books. To avoid cheesiness, predictability, 'syrup' and endless stereotypes I've always found it more tasteful to combine romance with another genre. That way, you avoid a story's unrealistic obsession with the two main characters. That's not to say that I hate the romance genre altogether- there are some exceptions and times when a story seems to be built at least half-realistically and can actually move me.In this case, although I'd put on my 'skeptic glasses' I at the same time had a lot more expectation than I usually would because I'd heard so many great things about the film.At first, when I see Noah, I think 'What's the matter with this guy?' and was about to write him off as a caricature, but his character made me laugh and with a little hesitation I accepted him as actually being realistic. I related to Allie's reaction to him maybe a little more than most because I would've treated him exactly the same way! Through the beginning of the film they kiss...a lot. Again my skeptical goggles are on, and I'm starting to suspect that this is another cheesy romance based on lust carefully- or perhaps, not so carefully- disguised as love, and patiently wait for the characters to mature. On the other hand, I think, they are teenagers, and just because they're horny doesn't mean they don't know what love is. Additionally, I would expect a bit more than that from the intelligent and sometimes sassy Allie and the bat crazy but pretty down to earth Noah. (No, seriously, he's crazy).Anyway, the movie continues on. I don't know if I'm particularly enthralled by the plot, but the actor's and actress's performances are flawless as far as I can see. Especially Ryan Gosling's. The way he looked at Rachel McAdams was a perfect combination of awe and longing, and it made us really believe that what we were seeing was real.Back to the plot: Some of the morals in the story are questionable, but when I say things like that I always battle with question in my mind of whether or not the actions of the characters are always meant to teach us a lesson, or whether or not some of the time they're simply there to display reality. Yes, there are times when Allie could've been more sensible, but really, how many of us haven't been insensible from time to time? As for whether or not true love could've sprang from Allie and Noah's 'summer romance' is questionable as well. Perhaps even the intervention of Allie's mother in their relationship wasn't as detestable as some might immediately begin to think. I loved this movie in that it didn't take advantage of pathetic stereotypes and create supporting characters just MADE to be hated. It didn't have the 'tunnel vision' that some romances have, where they almost force you to root for only the two lovebirds by making everyone else a total jerk. Instead everyone had some depth in them, and even though we didn't 'vouch' for them all the time, we could understand and relate to them.Either way, sometimes they say 'the end justifies the means' and the ending of the movie was what really touched me. No, I'm not going to spoil it for you, and no, I didn't shed any tears- I very, very rarely do over movies- but this really made me think somehow.This wasn't 'the best romance ever made' for me- or even really close to it- but it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and it had some pretty emotional moments to it. It even had a little comedy in it (though I must warn that I tend to laugh a lot at films). Again, I must repeat, the performances of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were flawless and actually very amazing, and that was the main enjoyment for me.",7,0,1,14 August 2006
Spider-Man 2," Even better than the original.
","Spiderman 2's predecessor set the scale for all of the other modern superhero movies to be made after it- at least for me.I think that the magic of the Spiderman series is that it is not a 'superhero' movie as much as it is a 'human' movie. A lot of the time in the first movie was spent developing Peter Parker's character as a person and his everyday life.That theme continues in Spiderman 2, with even more force. Peter begins to question whether or not saving the world is worth sacrificing the things that are important to him in his life. His job, his school, his friends, and most importantly, the long-time love of his life, Mary Jane Watson.Spiderman 2 stands out as a superhero movie that behaves more like a drama than an action movie- which is typical of a lot of second-rate superhero movies. It isn't all about the villains and the flashy battles scenes- though those remain.So in a way, the movie provides double-gratification. I get to enjoy all the unrealistic, fantasy elements of a superhero film without having to sacrifice a great plot- and even a carefully threaded in moral. There's something for everyone in Spiderman 2.As with the first movie, the acting remains excellent. Tobey Mcguire and Kirsten Dunst are still excellent as Spiderman and Mary Jane. James Franco's performance is actually stronger than it is in the original, with his behavior in a certain scene (which I cannot mention to avoid spoilers) particularly impressive.Even after seeing it a second time, Spider-man 2 is still my favorite movie.",10,2,2,14 January 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," Rather disappointing.
","The movie, although it had some fairly cute moments, had an extremely weak plot. There are no dramatic events within it, and thus, no room or place for the characters to grow. In fact, the movie doesn't even attempt to include those subtle moral themes that are so typical of most children's films- which, contrary to some beliefs can be a very good and important thing when done well.Instead of being the mysterious and wonderful film it was supposed to be, it seemed rather...bland. Adventures with Totoro seemed very aimless and could've been done a lot more colorfully.Also, what was up with that gigantic smile (and equally colossal roar) that Totoro had? Instead of being friendly, it appeared rather ominous. In fact it reminded my older siblings and I of the grin of Ghostly from Pokemon.I'm fairly sure, though, that somebody, somewhere, will be enchanted by this movie despite what I say. Seeing how my 4 year-old sister was enraptured by the film- and seemingly not at all disturbed by Totoro or his cat-shaped bus- I perhaps have the bias that comes with being skeptical and teen aged. I would, however, highly recommend those enchanted-creature-hungry-folk to leave this one and pursue one of Miyazaki's other films, or, Alice and Wonderland.So, after taking all factors into account, I've decided to be generous and give this movie a 7, whereas personally, it was more like a 6 for me.",7,1,16,15 April 2006
The Prestige," It absolutely blew my mind.
","The trailers for The Prestige carefully concealed it as a light-hearted film about a magician- nothing more, nothing less.I did not expect the dark, deep, and involving film that played out after I popped in my DVD.The opening lines, narrated by Michael Caine who plays the patron magician 'Cutter', are a big key to understanding the movie. Cutter explains that there are three important parts to a magic trick- the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Throughout the movie you will see how this law applies, as the 'secrets' to some of the tricks are revealed.The second part of the beginning of the movie follows. We see Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) trapped in a water-filled glass tank below stage, struggling to get out. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) goes underneath the stage and discovers him there. The movie then skips ahead to a trial, in which Alfred Borden is being charged for the murder of Robert Angier- he evidently drowned to death in the tank. Alfred Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die.A rich lord sends a messenger stating that he will take care of Borden's young daughter in exchange for the secret to Borden's greatest trick. The messenger is also sent to give Borden Angier's diary.That, is how our story really begins. We see through the point of view of Robert Angier as Borden reads through the diary.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden worked together underneath Cutter, until a tragic accident caused them to go their separate ways. Some time after they separated, Alfred Borden released an amazing trick. Angier, consumed with jealousy, did everything inside his power to find the secret to the trick. In fact, he began to doubt that it was a trick at all, but rather 'true magic. He was in constant competition with Borden, always trying to outdo him as a magician.Hugh Jackman does an excellent job in portraying Angier's passions, delusions, and melancholy. He completely blew me away with its vibrant showing of his true talent in this movie. After seeing the X-men films, I was almost certain that he was trapped as Wolverine, but when you watch this movie you will think absolutely nothing of Wolverine and absolutely everything of Robert Angier.Christian Bale, as always, was also excellent. I have not seen an actor so diverse, so adept at playing a variety of completely different roles in as long since perhaps Johnny Depp. Yet Christian Bale even outshines Johnny in that department. You will be reminded as little of him as Batman as you will of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He truly put on the character and he put him on with brilliance.The entire movie is a mystery up to the very end. We do not know if perhaps the rivalry did get out of control and Borden murdered Angier, or if Borden's magic is real and not just another clever illusion. What I can tell you, however, is that the conclusion will shock you, and you will be talking about, and thinking about the movie for long after the credits roll.",10,4,7,18 April 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Finally, I've seen the movie.
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was an interesting film, and one that stands out for its uniqueness in my memory.The movie sometimes plays more like a really long music video than a traditional western, and the soundtrack- which includes 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head'- is wonderful. The movie sometimes takes intermissions to display long passages of time through a series of photographs- all accompanied by the music, of course.The movie is undoubtedly a comedy with only a few serious moments. We follow the trail of the kindly, talkative 'Butch Cassidy' (Paul Newman) and his polar opposite, the dark, quiet, 'Sundance Kid' (Robert Redford), and The Sundance Kid's girlfriend, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), who, in typical western lass style fits in perfectly with the two men.Our stars are the outlaws, and as is natural in this kind of film, we find ourself rooting for the 'bad guys' and hoping that the mean, mean government people (why can't they understand it's not a crime, just another way of life?) don't catch up to them.The movie is a lot of fun, and leaves little to be desired, although it fails when it comes to matching the depth and seriousness of other westerns when it comes to the plot, and may bore some viewers.Oh, and of course, it is missing the famous 'draw.' Considering Sundance's god-like abilities with the pistol, though, that may have just been for the best.8/10 stars.",8,0,2,7 December 2006
Bridget Jones's Diary," A delightful romantic comedy.
","I really didn't know what to expect when I tuned into Bridget Jone's Diary on ABC Family.Though when I saw the very first scene, which features Bridget lip-synching hilariously to a depressing love song whilst watching an equally depressing movie on her television, I figured that it couldn't be that bad.I was right.Of course, for this to be a really good review, I would have to address the things I learned about the movie after watching it. I learned that some see in it a totally adorable woman they can relate to, and others see sexist trash.To say that Bridget isn't a terribly desperate single gal would be a total understatement. As a result, I must warn those of you females who feel that the portrayal of any such female- who, I MUST remind you still actually exist- is a jab at your independent womanhood, to stay out of this one.Although the plot in this movie can sometimes be a little predictable, Bridget is not. You never really know what is going to come out of the woman's mouth at any time- and neither does she, which adds to the entertainment.Additionally, the story is not entirely about Bridget Jones. A decidedly tongue-in-cheek side story involving her dysfunctional parents is present as well.I loved the performance of the actors in this movie. First of all, Renee Zellweger, of course, and second of all Hugh Grant, as he seemed perfect for the charming-yet-decidedly-perverse Daniel Cleaver.I certainly think that this movie is worth giving a chance to.",8,1,1,25 January 2007
Edward Scissorhands," More than skin deep.
","The one word that comes to mind when I think of this movie is- beautiful.The movie begins in a dimly lit room, where an elderly woman begins to recount the story of the life of a man with scissors for hands by the bedside of her young granddaughter. His creator died before he was able to finish him, leaving the man alone in his large estate.From there on out, the entire movie plays out like a kind of modernized fairytale- and the environment has everything to do with it. The town in which the story is set is utterly suburban and utterly isolated, as if were the only neighborhood on the planet. Every house is a different color and shape, but there is a kind of treeless sameness between them that pulls them all together, making them seem unoriginal and conformative. The same could be said of the cars, and how they all file out each morning in a bizarrely choreographed fashion to take the men that we hardly see to work.Yes, the film is mostly about the women of the town, all different, but who all share the common ailment of gossip. Peg (played by Diane Wiest), one of the film's main stars is a bit of an outsider. She is tidy, hard-working and sweet.After a particularly unsuccessful day of work as the local Avon saleswoman, she decides to try her luck at the oft-unvisited mansion at the end of the street. It is an almost exaggerated contrast to the sunny and ordered neighborhood right beside it. It is dark and towering, and the clouds hang over it so intensely that it almost looks to be in a different world. And that is probably what it represents.It is here, that she finds the shy and awkward Edward Scissorhands. Being the sympathetic person that she is, she invites him into her home. Thus begins his adventure into maturity, acceptance, rejection and love.We have to pause for a moment to make a note of the brilliance of Tim Burton. He created a character that looked like he's walked straight out of a horror movie, and is yet perhaps one of the most gentle and endearing characters you will ever come across. Edward's appearance is no mistake at all. Tim manages, to, without saying it overtly, challenge us not to judge on outward appearances and behaviors.Edward basically desires two things. For one, he wants to have regular hands, so that he can be 'complete' and normal like everyone else. The various ways in which he is treated display colorfully a myriad of stereotypes and opinions. More than one person tries to refer him to 'someone who can help him' and others see his unusual hands as something that makes him special.The second thing he desires is to be acknowledged by the girl that he is in love with- Peg's teenage daughter, Kim. It is through this that he gains more and more human emotions, such as heartache, jealousy, and anger.Johnny Depp shines once more in this role. Yes, that's right- this is the same Johnny who bravely battles the undead in Pirates of the Caribbean as Pirate Jack Sparrow. His performance as Ed is flawless and displays his absolute attentiveness to detail. From the quirky and quick way that he walks to his everyday pursed lips, to the heart-wrenchingly pained look in his face when he is misjudged, it's all made to try and clue us in to how Edward is feeling inside.Winona Rider did a great job as well in playing the part of Kim. At first she seems frightened of Edward, then annoyed at him, and later, sympathetic.The supporting actors and actresses all do well in their respective roles, especially Kathy Baker as the neighborhood 'maninizer'. Whether you loved her or hated her character (I simply thought she was plain whack) I think you will probably have to acknowledge that she played the role to perfection.It's sad that so many films seem to include a stereotypical Christian who sees evil in everything, but, alas, I even begrudgingly admit that Olan Jones was a good Esmeralda.Even with a great setting, and a great cast, the movie would be incomplete without an excellent soundtrack- which is exactly what it possesses. The music has an eerie, wispy tone to it, and it fits beautifully with the surreal feel of the movie.So what can we say in the end about Edward Scissorhands? I think it is a movie for the kind of people who like films that have an unconventional way of getting their point across. (Think, 'The Butterfly Effect'). Outwardly, it's just a story with a guy who has hands for scissors in a really bizarre-seeming setting. If you stop there, you might not enjoy it at all. Yet if you look deeper, you see that it is really a poetic love story. It's also not about Edward's scissor hands- it is about people who are different, and who feel incomplete. It is about people who feel that they are misunderstood because they don't quite know how to speak up, and the judgments that we often incorrectly make about them. Yet it portrays all of this in a concealed, and sometimes actually funny way.Unfortunately, as poet K. Bradford Brown said, 'The problem: We see us by our thoughts, intentions, and ideas; They see us by our actions.' So true.Equally true: This is a really good movie.",9,0,0,18 August 2007
The Butterfly Effect," I am finally able to write this review.
","On December 10th (a day before I am writing this review) I had to watch this movie for the second time- just to make sure that it was still the best movie that I have seen all year.It is.By watching this the second time, it simply drove in the fact that this movie was as ingeniously put together as I originally thought.Please, if you have never watched the film, do not be put off by its peculiar, seemingly mediocre beginning. I almost was, and I nearly missed a masterpiece.I was expecting- as many of you reading this probably are, or were- something totally and utterly different. The trailers gave the impression that this would be yet another thoughtless slasher horror flick. Ashton Kutcher's presence in the movie did not help. I had never previously watched any of his movies, and you would hope that 'Dude, Where's my Car?' was at least as good as 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', but I have my doubts.In this, however, Ashton Kutcher displayed for us his ability to both act in a serious role, and act in a serious role with excellence.More importantly, this was not at all the bloody teen horror film that I expected, but an intricately sewn together thriller that was based (although loosely) on the theory after which it was named- The Butterfly Effect. This theory states that small events can have catastrophic effects- such as the flapping wings of a butterfly acting as the prerequisite to a hurricane.Of course, you probably know the synopsis. After losing the woman that he loves, a man learns how to go back in time (no, I will not tell you how) and attempts to change the past, but each time he tries to change it, he ends up changing too much.Apart from being deliciously entertaining, The Butterfly Effect helped to drive in something that I had always known, but never wanted to believe. As cheesy as it may sound, The Butterfly Effect has made me realize how important it is to be grateful for life exactly as it is. I will quote from the movie, 'There is no perfect. You can't change what people are without changing what they were.' And, 'You can't play God.' This movie does not fit into just one genre. It is a science fiction, a fantasy film, a romance, and a drama, all rolled into one. Some may think this makes it disjointed, but I believe that it gives the film a depth that so many others lack. At times it made me laugh, other times it made me cover my face with horror, but for the most part it always had me at the edge of my seat.I also cried when it ended- which despite me being a sappy female happens very seldomly with movies. Yes, it was just that moving.Of course, I have my own opinions about what Evan should have done (the part of me that was in support of him changing things at all) but I will leave them to myself. What he should have done is not as important as what he does do. As a popular band once said, it is about the journey, not the end or the start.Now, if you do not get the movie the first time, try watching it a second time. Doing that helped me, too, even though I got most of it on the first try, and it has helped other viewers as well.Lastly, I must address the way this film is constantly compared to Donnie Darko and Memento- both of which I have seen before. The Butterfly Effect is not nearly as confusing as either of those, and the plot is radically different. Memento is played backwards for one, and Donnie Darko is sometimes more allegorical than it is literal and much darker a film than either one. They have almost nothing to do with each other in my opinion, apart from the fact that I liked all three, and that they do not follow the chronological patterns of your average movie.There ends the similarity.Oh, and by the way? The movie really is very violent, and its R rating quite deserved. The violence, however, is not the focus of the film, so please do not allow this to deter you from watching the movie.",10,9,19,11 December 2006
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Weird, but pleasant.
","Considering Miyazaki was the maker of Spirited Away (which I saw in bits and pieces) and Princess Mononoke I expected to find some weird things and creatures, and of course, wasn't disappointed.The main theme of the movie is generally 'humans are bad, humans messed up the earth, humans pollute everything, be kind to creatures, we fear what we don't understand' and so on and so forth. The plot itself, however, manages to use this theme without tipping the scales too far over to the 'mediocre and repetitive' direction.As for the characters, I failed to find too many problems with any of them. I liked Princess Nausica in particular. She was strong-willed, compassionate, and a leader without managing to come across as just another 'annoying princess.' The movie in general was boring in some places, but overall had a really original setting (so far as I know). A few of the battles were a little choppy/cheesy, and there was a lack of music beyond that of the ohm (sp?) song, but that I think I will have in my head for a very long time. It added a nice touch.This -probably- wasn't one of Miyazaki's best works (am I being too generous by not saying 'definitely'?), but I think if you just generally crave something animated that's a blend of both sci-fi and fantasy, this may just be an OK choice.",7,2,7,9 April 2006
Wimbledon," Superb.
","It's not often that you'll see me use the word 'suberb' in correlation with a romance work. This, however, is more than a romance. This is...Tennis. Pure, unadulterated tennis.I am by no means a pro tennis player, but after having played quite a few times, I related strongly to Peter's seemingly erratic thought patterns. I've known the pressure of a set point, and the futility you can feel when trying to assure yourself 'It's just another point.' Paul Bettany plays his role to complete perfection.Of course, the overall story of the movie is a little improbable. I admit to thinking initially that Kirsten Dunst's character is a little over the top, and the chances of someone like her falling in love in the course of a week and a half tournament seem slim to none. Something about the film, though, makes you believe.Maybe it's the fact that it's one of these films where you don't just see a 'the whole world revolves around the couple' kind of storyline. You see them struggle and fight, like -real- people do. Oh, and speaking of being real, certain other elements give this movie a sense of being 'in the real world.' I was really impressed and happy- though not totally surprised judging from past experience- to see John McEnroe and Mary Carillo in this film. They're real tennis commentators, and thank God they were acting as their normal selves in this movie. Also, the mentioning of such real tennis characters such as Tommy Haas, Lleyton Hewitt, and Roger Federer (of all people!) brought humor to the film. Of course we know Peter Colt and his unrealistically rude (or maybe not?) rival do not exist, but the movie still manages to make you ponder the what-ifs of such situations. That's what a good movie does.I know maybe giving this film a 9 might seem a little wacky. It has it's faults. For example, the way it looks sometimes when they're playing- how they keep the points short and change camera angles frequently because the actors and actresses, despite being able to play well enough to act the part, are far from professionals.It's a little predictable sometimes, but it has everything. Humor, romance, suspense, and of course, my favorite part-Tennis! (With special effects in there too.)",9,1,2,28 August 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," 'Why must the fireflies die so soon?'
","...a little girl asked.And I wish that I had an answer.The title (Grave of the Fireflies) probably sounds more fitted to a horror movie. Perhaps it is, but a different kind of horror- it depicts the horrors of World War II.It follows the story of Seta and Setsuko, two Japanese army children whose father is at war, and whose mother dies of burn injuries following an air raid on their city. They then go to live with their aunt on their father's side, who treats them as second-class members of her household because unlike her daughter and husband, they do not work.As a result of their aunt's demeaning attitude, a naive Seta decides to leave with his very young sister Setsuko and find some other place to live.The movie is unlike any movie of its type that I have ever seen- more or less because of the attitude of Seta. He always possessed a bright and happy disposition in the midst of hardship and tried to allow his sister to live as normal a childhood as possible. The movie focuses on the innocent, joyful moments that the two had together, including playing and bathing together and their oft hobby of going out to catch fireflies during the summer nights. We never feel unaware that a war is going on or the struggles the two are facing, but at the same time the special relationship between Seta and Setsuko is more highly emphasized than many of the tragedies going on around them.The animation of the movie is smooth and life-like. Of course, the coloring and shading of modern anime works exceeds that of this movie, but I can still watch this and be nearly as impressed with it as with either of those.The fact that it is animated detracts nothing from the feel and flow of the movie. In fact, in many ways it adds to it- at least for me. Those cute moments are made even cuter than they could've been without this; the flashbacks to memories are made even more hauntingly sad.Either way, this is a movie that cut me like few that I have ever seen in my life. Some movies have made me sad, but only three have brought me to tears. After the movie, I was eating a Popsicle- of all things- and suddenly everything hit me all at once and I bursts into tears.It was less of an emotional roller-coaster the second time around, but not less of a movie. It's definitely a must-see in both the tragedy and anime genres.",9,1,2,26 July 2007
Toy Story," This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.
","Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a 'family' movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste!",8,0,0,5 June 2003
War of the Worlds," Magnificent.
","The imagery and graphics were fairly amazing- especially the scenes in the beginning when the aliens first emerged.Dakota Fanning acted well in this film, and though sometimes her character screamed a little too often her behavior was pretty well scripted. Tom Cruise was simply brilliant, and, as he usually is, funny.Justin Chatwin's character Robbie could be a little annoying, but since he didn't have much of a role in this overall film it was hard to judge whether his acting was good or bad. Like I said, too, if there was any bad acting we could blame the script more than Chatwin.The overall story was done really well and realistically- especially the chaos ensuing. The end, however, left something to be desired. I felt like they could have explained things a little bit better than they did.All in all, though, I loved the film and would definitely recommend it to other viewers.",8,1,2,12 August 2006
Bring It On," Did I waste 2 hours of my life?
","That's what this movie had me thinking at the end of it. This, even with the ending credits actually being one of this movie's best parts. It featured the cast of the movie lipsynching and dancing to the song 'Hey Mickey.' Bring it On could be a real pain in some points. The combined crudeness and general long length it seemed to take for the movie to reach its climax made it a bit difficult to watch.The movie finally gets a move on it, when Torrance, shortly after becoming squad captain, discovers that the former Torros captain had been stealing the cheerleading routines of a squad from another school- the Clovers. Torrance then, overcome with guilt and shame, takes it upon herself to create a fresh routine for the team before the finals that are only a few weeks away. Torrance attributes much of her problems to 'the curse.' The Curse was the hilarious myth that Torrance picked up at cheer camp, that claimed that dropping the 'spirit stick' caused bad fortune to follow you for the rest of your life.The movie definitely has its quite humorous moments. The more shallow characters are clearly parodies- in fact, most of the film is indeed a parody. The movie in some ways teaches a lesson by mocking those who are proud of themselves for cheating to win.My favorite characters were as follows- Torrance Shipman, (Kirsten Dunst) president of the Torros squad; Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), Torrance's closest friend and 'ally' on the squad; Cliff Pantone (Jesse Bradford), Missy's electric-guitar-playing, constantly-CD-player-wearing, cheerleader-hating brother and Torrance's romantic fixation throughout the greater part of the film. I think, they in many ways save the movie by bringing it a little more down to earth.The acting in the movie was as good as was to be desired considered the circumstances. In fact, I didn't think that it was that bad.As for the cheer routines? Colorful, brilliant, and all around excellent for lack of more creative wording.Despite that, if I had one word to summarize my opinion on the movie it would be; subpar. Though, perhaps we ought to cut it some slack. After all, it WAS a 'teenage' movie. How many of those are actually really good? Did I waste 2 hours of my life? Maybe. But I'm definitely not screaming in agony.",6,0,1,30 May 2007
Happy Feet," 'Cute' just ain't the word.
","To call Happy Feet 'cute' would be an understatement. To fully describe it, you'd need a litany of adjectives, such as 'extroidinarily', 'exceedingly', 'intensely', and 'tremendously' set in front of the word 'cute' in order for your description to be complete.If you have read the synopsis, you probably already know the story. It follows the life of 'Mumble' (Elijah Wood), the penguin youngling of parents 'Norma Jean' (Nicole Kidman) and 'Memphis' (Hugh Jackman), who, because of certain circumstances, was born with the ability to dance instead of the ability to sing. When he attempts to sing, he creates a sound similar to that of a shrill, rusty horn- only about 10 times worst. It will make you laugh and wince all at once.The voice acting in the movie was colorful and diverse, with a variety of different accents to help express each character. Robin Williams was amazing as the narrator. Most of the songs sung in the movie are probably very familiar to most people, and they were done in the most fun, 'cute' way possible.After an hour of giggling, though, I fell silent as the movie took a turn for the serious. It started to deal with such political issues as man's misuse of the environment, religious tolerance, and social acceptance. To be honest, I was a little taken back. I didn't expect such a heavy hit from what I thought was nothing but a cute little kid's film.I felt that at some points, the movie lost a little of it's flow and started trying too hard to make it's moral points. I felt that the ending was a bit rushed.All in all though, it was an incredible, original movie and I don't think that I will forget it soon.Oh, and it doesn't hurt that the animation is absolutely magnificent either.",8,0,1,17 April 2007
V for Vendetta," An entertaining film with not so entertaining holes.
","When the movie begins, we see Prothero, one of the members of the fascist government of Chancellor Adam Sutler, speaking on the screen. I could not help but laugh at his speech, that included phrases about 'judgment' and 'Don't you think He's watching'- the latter made with eyes rolled upwards and a finger pointed to the sky. Finally his confession, 'I am a man of faith' thrown in there to top it all off.Yes, the entire movie is a parody- a completely extreme, twisted, and comical version of reality.Yes, we all remember a world when witches, homosexuals, and adulterers were burned at the stake by Christians. The modern governments of the Western world, however, have stopped these practices. 10-20 years from now- the time period in which the movie is set, I expect that gay marriage would be legal, and gays accepted and supported. A leader like Chancellor Sutler would never be elected, even in a 'time of crisis and war' as the movie depicts.What started the crisis and war is in itself extremely sketchy. That's because this movie just doesn't flow from event to event the way it should. What V was actually fighting for was blurry.Throughout the movie we see Nazi-like curfews, 'Unity Through Faith' signs all over the place, government lies and censorship and grossly unfair trials and imprisonment.(can someone say, jab at Guantanemo Bay?) This however, isn't enough to wake people out of complacency. The idea becomes, 'I'll just do what the government says, and not get hurt.' Now what we didn't see- things addressed only a few times- such as the government poisoning it's own people (and pinning it on Muslim terrorists), the tragic story told by 'Valerie' depicting the imprisonment of homosexuals, and of course, the outlawing of Islam- should've been causing quite a stir.First off, I again doubt that a 'deeply religious Conservative' (that ring any bells?) preaching 'Unity through Faith' would seek to achieve it by poisoning his own people and making sure that only the government has the cure. I mean, come on. If you're going to make a fascist Christian, please make him realistic.Secondly, as I said before, gays would be widely accepted and supported. People would not sit by and let that to happen to them.As for the fact that owning a Koran would result in death? A lot of people forget that England has a large Arabic minority, some of which are doubtless Muslims. Islamic people don't just sit by and let things like that happen to them. The result would be a bloody, endless war.We didn't see any of that. In fact, the only thing V actually insulted in his pre-Jordan-Tower-destructing speech was the government suppression of 'ideas' and the ambiguous but familiar sentence, 'something is wrong with this country.' As I mentioned, ideas weren't suppressed enough to actually drive the people we typically saw to revolution.I'm not saying that the movie wasn't entertaining- because, it was. We have a dark, masked man with pretty knives, who systematically kills members of the fascist party, both for their involvement in his mutation? and burning as well as for their creation of the virus and the atrocities committed in the process. He leaves roses on their corpses. Let's not forget his rhymes, fetish for alliterations beginning with 'V' and obsession with lovely music and fireworks.Also, speaking of which, why on earth would the government seize and outlaw 40s movies, old jazz music, and Greco- Roman paintings and statues? V tells Evey that he stole them from the government as they survey them in his house.Also, why did Chancellor Sutler have all the real butter? There was no reason. The government was just horrible, bad, and greedy because it was just that.As for V, I didn't see him as the hero that he was portrayed as. I saw him as a vengeful psycho, and truth be told couldn't understand much of what he was trying to say or do. It got even more confusing when he started falling in love with Evey. I don't know if that was Lloyd's or the Waschowski brothers' fault. They promised to eliminate masked hero stereotypes, but they forgot to eliminate the biggest of all; the one where a 'dark protagonist' falls in love with an 'angel' and his black heart is enlightened to some new truth.Then, of course, there was when V spoke one of the worst lines in movie history, after a final battle that looked a lot like I'd heard it described- a mix of Equilibrium and the Matrix. Was it cool? Yes- but they could've done better.Anyway, Creedey shoots him and says, 'Why won't you die?' To which V responds, 'Under this mask, there is more than than skin, muscle and bone. There is an idea, Mr. Creedey, and ideas never die.' That was almost as bad as, 'Do you know what happens to a toad that's struck by lightening?' Now, after wading through the disjointedness- which, is unexpected when you're trying to make a romance, superhero film, political thriller, action movie, AND adaptation of a graphic novel all at the same time- and leftist/liberal propaganda, I actually found a gem in there somewhere.A little before the fated November the 5th, V tests Evey by creating a scenario in which she is captured by the 'police', and she refuses to give any information about his whereabouts. She is tortured, and finally scheduled to be shot.V's excuse? He wanted her to become free of fear. He wanted her to see, that you shouldn't be afraid to die for what you think is right. V's method for getting the truth to her was questionable- as most things he did were in my opinion- but I think that's a universal message for us all.",7,0,2,12 August 2006
