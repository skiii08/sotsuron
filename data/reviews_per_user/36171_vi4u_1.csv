Walk the Line," Excellent performance by Reese, but thought Joaquin stood out more.
","This movie was a very good movie in telling the heartbreaking and beautiful love story of these two great people. Although Reese did a very good June Carter,after all she did win the Oscar for her role. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was outstanding as Johnny Cash. He should have won the Oscar for it, as it was well-deserved. The competition was too heavy this year, but the kind of movie that is not soon forgotten. I have the deluxe edition on DVD, which is wonderful. My family also found it a great movie, and one of them never liked Johnny Cash before, but is a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix. There aren't enough words to describe this wonderful. wonderful movie. Being a great fan of Joaquin Phoenix I am looking forward to more performances from him, no matter what it may be. He has gained a lot of fans via this movie I'm sure. For anyone wanting to see a great movie and great performances watch, and better still, go out and buy it on DVD. Try it, you'll love it.
