Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," whats the deal ?
","This movie took an interesting movie genre in a new direction and for me fell flat on its face. The only time I laughed were not at the jokes intended but a few moments of sanity displayed by the 'documntary participants'. The portrayal of the knowledge cultural norms and values of Borat were so far fetched and removed from reality made the attempts at humor fall flat for me.The irony and humor of 'the stranger in a strange land genre' works best when it points out true distinctions and revaluation's based on differing 'realities' or world views, be they cultural, gender oriented or age based. Aside from the running gag involving 'personal space' in Borat's greeting Americans this film was devoid of any of this reality. For me Borat was not entertaining not funny. The only thing i came away with was some interesting musings on why the movie could be so popular.",1,12,26,14 November 2006
