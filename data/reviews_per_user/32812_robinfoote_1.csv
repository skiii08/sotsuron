Mission: Impossible III," Better than Expecting
","Wow this film blew me away. I'm not usually a big fan of action movies so i got dragged to this one and was pleasantly surprised. I assumed it would be overly predictable and cheesy, but the one-liners were said with enough humour and good timing and there was so much action that there was no time to think too far ahead! It was a relentless ride with twists and turns that i didn't find too predictable.Then again this could all be because i was sitting too close to the screen and got lost in the moment.You've definitely got to see this one",9,1,3,6 May 2006
