Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great film and the starting point of the devestation that there is to come in the Star Wars Galaxy.
",Since I am a huge Star Wars fan I understood the film a bit better then most people who actually watched it. This film leaves everithing ready for Palpetines rise to power and the eventuall fall of the jedi order and the republic. It is because of this that i am awaiting the devestation to come in Episode II and III and I belive that episode I was a great movie for setting the mode of whats to come.,10,0,0,23 August 1999
