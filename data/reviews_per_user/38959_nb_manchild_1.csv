Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Has there ever been a comedy that contains so many classic scenes
","Borat was relentless from the word go there were countless moments where it just made you want to laugh out loud and cringe at the same time. It just showed how ridiculous some peeps are in middle America, they were still cheering when he called Bush a warlord!!!! Anyways just wanted to say thoroughly enjoyed it and hope they don't push Cohen into rushing a follow up with Bruno as this was such a well thought out production.One question who thought Pamela was acting or didn't have a clue?Frank: You know I was thinking we could go back home... have some dinner and pop in the Sisqo CD... no? Weren't thinking that? OK.",10,2,13,6 November 2006
