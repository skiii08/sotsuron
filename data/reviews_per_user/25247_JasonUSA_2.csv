Lucky Number Slevin," WOW, Thats all I can say WOW
",Unbelievable movie I saw it tonight expecting to see a good movie due to the fact of the amazing cast of actors involved in making the film. It is a little confusing in the beginning but just relax and take it in it all clears up in the end. I cant believe how well this movie was thought out and how well everyone in the cast took on their roles. If you like action/mystery movies it is great and you will be amazed. it is not really like any movie I have seen in a long time. There are really not enough words or explanations to sum up this movie just because it was so good. I'm going to see it again tomorrow because I think it will be cool to see all the little tidbits I missed from the first viewing as you will see after you see it. 10 out of 10 is an understatement for this movie watch it and you will see.,10,1,8,19 April 2006
Inside Man," Not all that :(
",I honestly thought that it could have been better it was sort of a wannabe Oceans 11. Thought out quite well but not all that great the very end of the movie just before the credits had a nice scene but all in all it was really far fetched. I expected more suspense or something to give it some IMF. Wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year but wasn't the best. All in all Denzels performance was good as usual but the rest of the actors were nothing great. Spike Lee uses a lot of racist comments about certain races which I found not to my liking but when it came down to the Nig*er word he made all sorts of sneaky little ways of people not using it which I thought was quite weak because when you down other races and leave your own out it makes you look weak. I really expected something better something more gripping but if you got nothing to do on a Friday night go see Ice Age 2 if you have seen it I would tell you to go see inside man.,6,3,4,11 April 2006
