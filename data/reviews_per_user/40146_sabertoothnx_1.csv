Hereditary," What the hell did I watch?
","The movie started off well, you initially get the eerie feeling like you would of something like the witch, the little girl plays the creepy role well and maybe the movie should have been based around her, however alot of the story seemed under developed, why are they isolated away from the city? Why don't they have electricity? Like ever? Also certain events seemed a little predictable (Joane being a little too convenient) yet at the same some events weren't what you thought were going to happen. I have to admit it did have quite a few scares and some really disturbing ones as well are a couple really stupid ones (The End). I don't know how I feel about this.",6,1,2,23 August 2018
