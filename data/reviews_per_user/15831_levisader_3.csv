Mission: Impossible III," good story, good action = GREAT MOVIE!
","This is by far the best mission Ethan hunt has ever been on. It is cool, exciting and entertaining. i saw it in theatre 5 times. not lying. And I bought it the day it came out.Tom Cruise Prooves that he is a smart, great and fearless actor with a great charisma in all the Missions. If he wasn't in them, I don't think they would have done nearly as well.I bet you if this movie came out 3 years ago, it would have a done a ton better at the box office.I give this movie a 10/10 because it is filled with action, great acting and a story that is fit for any actor.",10,1,3,28 November 2006

Casino Royale," the Names Craig, Daniel Craig
","I LOVED this movie!I went to the first show of the first day. It was perhaps the best James bond i have ever seen! Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan are to me the best bonds. i was surprised by Daniel Craig's performance. He was dark, cold and also had a little bit of a sense of humor.This movie is filled with action and a well written story.If you have not seen it then you should see it right away.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. if you don't like this movie, you should see it again.",10,0,1,28 November 2006
