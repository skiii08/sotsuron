First Man," Nothing, honey. Your dad's going to the Moon.
","As with La La Land, Damien Chazelle's First Man is shot on celluloid, with rich film grain and colours and tones which seem to blend together. Shooting on film is an aesthetic in itself, visual nostalgia imprinted on the strips of emulsion. The roving, handheld camera works to mimic the look and feel of a dusty home video unearthed from a box of old tapes. This is considerably effective when Chazelle wants to capture the mood of a lazy summer afternoon as the kids chase each other around the backyard, or thrust the viewer into the shoes of Neil Armstrong being assaulted by a frenzy of camera flashes and microphones. It's riveting even when the camera locks down onto the astronauts in their tin capsules and refuses us the closure of cutting to a wide shot; we are strapped in there with them, resigned to the same fate of hoping thousands of calculations and scribbled numbers will bring success. There's nothing precise or mathematical about these scenes; it's pure, edge-of-your-flimsy-seat tension. But there's only so much shaking you can do, and in the domestic settings it just feels nauseous, and dampens the tension of the climax when we've already been shoved inside a metal container and shook vigorously for the last couple of missions.Unlike La La Land, which was framed from head to toe to capture the full efforts of its choreographers, First Man forces the camera up close and personal, often not even allowing the whole head into the frame. While in some instances this can be effectively suffocating, it's much too frequent for a decade-long biopic with a runtime of 141 minutes. Where is the time for stillness, for the audience to take a breath? There's surprisingly little patience shown for a film of this length, with serene moments like a harp and theremin serenading their lonely ascent into space a rarity.It's important for film criticism to avoid the territory where you're merely denouncing a film for not being something else. For First Man, taking on the monumental task of telling the intimate tale behind a mythological figure of modern America, meeting all expectations seems impossible. We want him to live up to the legend, and yet expect a personal, human story behind the glamour and fame. Chazelle doesn't oblige this paradox, wading through pre-release controversy about the omission of the planting of the American flag. This is a symbolic move of the clearest intentions; First Man isn't about America's political standoff against the Soviets. There's no customary shot of Houston exploding into cheers when Armstrong breaches that cosmic frontier. The film is for Elliot See, for Ed White, for Apollo missions 1-10, and for Karen Armstrong.But all that is for naught when you consider Ryan Gosling's rendition of Neil Armstrong, who remains so highly strung throughout that we're never quite sure how to feel for him. While I'm not a fan of restricting 'good acting' to tremulous explosions in the vein of Michael Shannon or Daniel Day Lewis, someone really should tell Gosling he is allowed to act like a normal human being. His stoic shtick may have worked when he played a near-android in Lars and the Real Girl, or an actual android in Blade Runner 2049, but here he's entirely too tight, rendering an icon into a bundle of nerves and murmured lines. There's no need for his famous one-liner to be revelatory - it's not that kind of movie. But after two hours of the same monotone, it spills out like a mere afterthought, deflating the moment.This wouldn't be a deal-breaker if it wasn't for Chazelle's re-positioning of the moon mission as the ultimate catharsis for Armstrong, looking to memorialise his late daughter. But partnered with Gosling's reservation, the effect is an emotional chasm between Armstrong and the rest of his family, who are little more than pawns in his resolute mission. Even as it gives Claire Foy a platform to be more than just a worried suburban housewife (she's remarkable considering what she is given to work with, and how all the grieving is strictly allocated to Gosling), it places too much emphasis on the landing to be life-changing at the expense of his other sons. And to think that the Armstrong's marriage lasted another 20 years, when here it is depicted at breaking point. To where could he possibly go next? This Neil Armstrong seems destined to remain behind an exhibit behind the quarantine glass.",6,1,2,3 November 2018
Come and See," Idi i smotri
","Many little boys have had the same dreams and aspirations as the young Flyora has, to serve his country for glory and honour. Most have not gone through what he experiences in Come and See. The first image is of an old man who is slyly employing reverse psychology to get the boys to stop digging for weapons. He screams himself hoarse like a withered drill sergeant; later as he is found covered in burns inflicted by the Germans, he again heeds his warning, but it is too late. There is no doubt he speaks from experience - he knows the war's terrors, but perhaps he also knows the childlike excitement of playing guns and wanting to march off to defend his country. He, like Flyora's mother, is trying desperately to stop this vicious cycle. She acts exasperated at Flyora's antics, and his desire to join the troops. He is given the old 'act like an adult' treatment as she tells him to brandish the gun and kill them now (because him going off to war would mean the same thing). But as soon as the dream becomes reality Flyora is once again her baby boy, and she whimpers and tries to coddle and hold onto him in vain. An interesting mentality portrayed here is the soldier's treatment of the war as an opportunity to pose and mould their image. There is a sequence where the camp gathers around for a comradely group shot - they jeer and push and shove and grin, and it seems all fine and dandy. What the camera doesn't capture is the harsh reality of the conditions they endure. Some of the film's most indelible images are not of violence, but of the sheer filth and grim of the camp's various facilities; Flyora scrubbing uniforms in a great big pot of boiling water, and a great, grey chunk of smoking meat (the animal is indistinguishable) rising from a similar pot (the connection is easily established and harder to forget). Later the Germans pose too; in one of the film's iconic shots, a gun is held to the terrified boy's head, and no doubt that photo is going to be framed and used for further purposes. Klimov touches on this theme, perhaps not with the greatest nuance or detail. Here it exists as a simple metaphor - of war being a posed experience for the wider public, for the young boys back home who see only white smiles and shiny guns. Come and See is showing us what lies underneath. And yet, has the message seeped into Flyora? The film's events continually hurtle towards him, bringing wave of devastation after devastation. But even halfway in when we are convinced this is hell, Flyora still maintains that the soldier is an honourable mantle as he shouts to the farmer. See how periodically Klimov inserts moments of him caressing and cleaning his rifle like an infant child, even after he has seen the destruction that can be released from its barrel. He grips it tightly after he has lost his family, like it is the only comfort he has left in the world, refusing to let go and be rendered vulnerable. And it is not even certain that he has registered the deaths either; as they run out of his decaying home, Glafira looks back to see a pile of bodies stacked up against the side of the wall like they were nothing more than firewood, but Flyora is convinced that his mother is still alive somewhere in the bog. Klimov shows great restraint here; it would have been easy to linger onto this shocking image for a lot longer, but the shot is brief before Glafira is dragged away by Flyora's delusions, and we are left gaping and wondering if what we saw was really that unimaginable horror. The film's weakest moments make it clear that this is a product of propaganda, set to expose the atrocities committed on the Eastern Front - the Germans are simple, cruel villains that spit out harsh antisemitism (when in reality many soldiers, though they swore the Reichswehreid, did not subscribe to Nazism) and carry out their duty with almost a evil relish, yet they are also cowardly, folding easily under the steely gaze of the partisans and renouncing their ways under the guise of only following orders. The most ludicrous moment comes when Flyora is confronted with a portrait of Adolf Hitler, and footage of the war rewinds and rewinds until he is faced with the infant Fuhrer himself, but cannot pull the trigger. This reeks of oversimplification and sentimentalism; the young boy's turmoil and rage over the horrors of war and yet abated by the very innocence he shed only moments ago. It belongs in a Hollywood film, and a poor one at that. But Aleksey Kravchenko has made what seems like a straightforward play of morality harrowing and unsettling. His early wide grins at being given extra guard duty are replaced by an expression that can only be the thousand yard stare, the lines in his face weathered and almost gouged in. They belong on a face much older and have no business appearing in his youthful visage. At select moments Klimov uses straight on, symmetrical head shots as a way of mimicking intimacy (Ozu used this technique quiet often). These give the hollow-eyed, blank stares of Flyora an immensely distressing quality, and we cannot look away, yet we also cannot bear to meet his gaze (though his mind is working more than his eyes are). The final shot is masterful; it assumes the point-of-view of Flyora, jogging mechanically at the back of the group, fleeing momentarily into the forest, but as if remembering just a glimmer of the feral, solider mentality of the beginning, he rejoins the partisans. And then he comes to a complete stop in the track, and we can almost feel the child inside him fade away.",8,1,3,28 May 2016
Love and Death," Make it quarter to twelve.
","Tolstoy may have War and Peace, but it pales in comparison to the sweeping gravitas of Allen's Love and Death, which tackles two even more universal issues which plague us all. In this film, Allen shows his remarkable talent at engaging with grander, more immediate themes that his earlier comedies but still have that magic touch which turns any situation into hilarity. The plot is a parody of the dense, high- minded Russian epics, in particular those of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. Allen's neurotic, wimpy type is dropped right into the setting, Russia during the Napoleonic Wars, where all the young men are practically jumping out of their skin to serve their motherland, whilst Boris would rather sheepishly sneak away and work on his butterfly collection. Allen's physical comedy is on show here in brilliant form; most notably in a montage of all his army incompetencies and goofs, his schoolboy wooing tactics of a Countess, and perhaps the most delightful of them all, a muted, sped up slapstick sequence involving Allen, Keaton and a guard they are trying to knock out with an empty bottle, which recalls the silent film masters and their antics. He uses the frame (see the bickering and slap-fighting of Napoleon and his double) and the edit (six minutes later the Countess' room is strewn with overturned furniture like a thief had been through it) to great effect. The film tackles all the dense philosophical ideas of the Russian literature it parodies with a bemused perspective. Boris sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the gruff and uncivil Russian environment and spouts streams of existential jargon that become so complex and redundant that they lose all meaning. He constantly spars verbally with her cousin Sonja, the Anna Karenina figure, who is also embroiled in a web of social anxieties and troubled relationships. Keaton has a remarkable knack for her deadpan delivery of the absurd, further pushing these situations into hilarity: 'I'm twenty eight and he's eighty one.' When that man drops dead suddenly in her moment of faux triumph, she quickly decides on another lover, and the film treats it as if they were destined for each other, despite his tendency to talk about the herring industry very seriously and her tendency to sleep around vicariously (the tender deathbed moment interrupted by exaggerated coughing and clearing of throats at the mention of her 'purity' is gold). Watching this with the knowledge of the prevalence of the Allen-type about to boom next with Annie Hall and so on is extremely valuable. Here Allen has the self-awareness of the pitfalls of his intellectual character and has perfectly emphasised them in a context that asks for the opposite. He is not the heroic soldier but rather stumbles onto an opportunity which covers his chest with medals. His awkward aversion for violence is mistaken for the highest of nobilities (A similarly amusing pistol duel that year from Barry Lyndon also mocks the prissy, formal nature of these life-and-death shootouts). He is an intellectual like so many before and after him, and sensual, and as spiritual as he can be, but never really takes life seriously because there is an existential meaningless about it. Life's cruel twist is that he has this sort of spiritual awakening as he is jailed, a Dostoevskian epiphany, and as just as he decides to have found his meaning for living, God stands him up. And so he dances on along with Death. Very funny indeed, in a cruel and ironic way.",9,3,3,7 May 2016
Catch Me If You Can," Do you concur?
","Leonardo DiCaprio occupies the role of Frank Abagnale with such ease that it is easy to forget that he is just a teen at the beginning - and barely an adult when it is over. I suppose it is easy for him to forget this too; slipping into these alternate identities lets him live the life he wants, get back the money they took from his father, and escape from a broken family. When he mimics the famous two mice in a bucket of milk speech when asked to say grace, it is funny, but also contains a hint of melancholy like Walken's sparse appearances throughout his con life. The suit, the cadillac, the money...all just items to show off to his father, to show that he has made it, to try and piece this family back together again. How many windows has he peered into to see happy Christmas celebrations? How many half-sisters has he waved at?Momentarily, he distracts himself with the thing he is good at. A little folded note, a little substitute teacher impersonation. Then onto bigger things, and although we know how the story ends, we are nevertheless fascinated. Spielberg's direction is visually captivating - the peering reveal over to the bathtub full of model air-planes, the swing across to the frightened bank teller informing her manager (to signal one plan that doesn't work - so he learns and adjusts his cons), the way he racks focus from the fine print of the check to DiCaprio to indicate just how precise and alluring his charms and deflections are. Williams is great too - the way he builds momentum and confidence as Frank becomes more adept, and twinkles when we see closeups of the favourite trick that he inherited from his father. Completing the effect are those endearing voice-overs of faux-success and worldly experience to his father - no doubt a very important part of his motive is to impress him. This is one of DiCaprio's better performances. He doesn't have a whole lot of emotional range to work with (for example, the real Abagnale left his medical supervisor position because he realised he was putting lives at stake - in the film it is completely comedic) and even when he does emote it is somewhat an act - see the bait and switch where he seems to confess to Roger Strong, but becomes a soppy romantic instead. His best moment is the way he slides effortlessly into the Secret Service Agent 'Barry Allen' only after a tiny second of realisation of what he has been caught in - the way his approach disarms Hanratty so subtly ('Here, take my whole wallet'), the way he mimics his tactics to build authenticity ('Mind if I see some identification') and how he is able to uses his own knowledge to pose as someone who has been diligently chasing himself down. Hanks' Hanratty is decent as the straight man who is initially consumed by the chase; there are some juvenile moments including a harsh cackle over the phone at Christmas which doesn't quite work because Hanks is not mean enough for it and because their dynamic works so much better when they are ribbing and teasing - Hanratty not falling for his whole sickness routine in jail, and constantly trying to pry his methods for passing the bar exam. It even manages to be a little poignant at the end between the two. Feeling suffocated by the never-ending sentence to bust the scams he once mastered, he takes off and even makes it to the airport to seek that life of lies that seems to be easier than confronting the truth; the death of his father, and the new marriage and family of his mother. Hanratty is all but ready to let him go, but reminds him that no one will be chasing this time. Perhaps he was right when he realised that Abagnale had no one to call at Christmas. DiCaprio's frenzied reaction to seeing him deep in hiding in France suggests that he is most at ease constantly moving from place to place and busying himself with the thrill of the chase. Even James Bond had to call it a day when his time was up, and Frank is now ready to accept it.",8,2,4,11 February 2016
Marie Antoinette," The problem of leisure / What to do for pleasure
","One of the few responsibilities of Queen Marie Antoinette sees her made to pose, abide by tradition and simper as she decorates war heroes with flowery laurels and allows them the unique privilege of bowing in her presence and giving tribute to their gracious rulers. Usually there's two ways to go about a period piece like this: you take it on with complete sincerity, you ask the actors to speak with the appropriate accent (which is never American), and maybe you win a few Oscars. Or you could attack the source itself and make a mockery of this posturing; history was never as genteel and refined as it is in the movies, so why pretend? The aforementioned scene is a perfect opportunity for the latter, given the frivolous nature of her role in these proceedings. Instead it's the setup for her later affair with the dashing Axel Fersen - they feel a connection at first glance, and later make googly eyes at each other over the table. It's like high school all over again. Marie Antoinette, Sofia Coppola posits, was not that much different than your average teenager of today, and has the immaturity and lack of self-awareness to match. She starts trends (clapping at the theatre) and then later is astounded that she's no longer 'in', her flash in the pan popularity a thing of the past. She brushes off the local gossip as if her status is impervious to its slander. Watching the film is like walking into a giant box of Ladurée macarons, with the pale pastel colours turned to eleven, and giants hands to give it a good shake. Certain sections wouldn't be out of place in a music video, with its giggly irony, bundled anachronisms and the rebellious streak of Bow Wow Wow and The Strokes. It's not just a phase.Simultaneously Coppola wants to draw out the existential angst of being imprisoned by the materialism of the royal position, but there's little desperation or awareness under the surface. Her life is portrayed as one of fanciful bliss, naivety and ignorance of the political and social turmoil that swept her country at the time. This premise of juvenile insularity and stylistic extravagance to match it might have worked as a short film, with some well-directed irony and a thunderclap of a denouement. But Coppola insists on drawing it out over two hours, in which the historical timeline ticks on but Dunst gains no extra wisdom or insight. Coppola tries to find cruel inhumanity beneath the lavish artifice; see the initial procedures Marie Antoinette undergoes, brutally 'stripped' of her Austrian roots, her femininity revoked, her role reduced to an asset instead of a woman. But observe how fragile the film's treatment of this process is, and how delicately the camera is sure to respect Dunst's no-nudity clause. Compare this to a film like The Scarlet Empress, where Marlene Dietrich's wide-eyed Sophia is groped and inspected like a package upon arrival in Moscow, only for her to later rise from the ashes and become a powerhouse. There's no phoenix rebirth here - Coppola's more concerned about Dunst losing her puppy instead of her identity and childhood. This is typical of much of Sofia Copppola's films, so intent on uncovering the humanity behind the rich and privileged that they gain tunnel vision and forget about everyone else, and forgo sympathy for their cause (given her past, it's a deeply personal concern). The film conveniently avoids elaborating on the rest of her life - the struggles of motherhood and losing her children young, her gradual push into the political court, urging her husband to take on the revolutionaries - because that would invalidate her little fantasy. Dunst is as good as this vision allows her, callow and casually American in a French court. Schwartzman has the same accent but is more intriguing as the young king thrust onto the throne and made to learn on the go. His timid, laconic performance is quietly subversive of the real Louis XVI: you can imagine God proclaiming divine right in one of Schwartzman's dreams, only for him to ask, 'Are you sure?'If Coppola was a little braver she might have gone for the jugular and shown her execution, utilise it as a violent counterpoint to Marie Antoinette's self-contained fantasy. But even delivering consequence the film is revising history, softening events, letting characters off the hook. Recall how every beat in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is staged to poke fun at the logic and sheen of his imagined historical epic (the unmade Napoleon), and then you will see how little self-awareness Marie Antoinette has in comparison. It positions itself as ironic, but in reality it is as shallow as its eponymous heroine.On the morning of the 5th of October 1789, an angry mob stormed the royal palace of Versailles, mounted two of the guards' heads on pikes, and gathered under the King's quarters. They called for justice, for bread, for the royal family to be placed under political arrest. The king comes out onto the balcony to attempt to bargain, and afterwards they call for the Queen. She answers their call, coming out with her eldest son Louis Joseph, but they want her alone - perhaps the sight of children threatened to satiate their bloodlust. So she bares the full fury of the mob alone, and in a remarkable and inexplicable performance, she calms them. Now they cry, 'Vive la Reine! Long live the queen!' Now, isn't this infinitely more interesting than a giggly, infantile schoolgirl?",5,0,0,15 February 2017
Casablanca," The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.
","'I like to think you killed a man. It's the Romantic in me.' muses Captain Renault as he tries to prise open the complex puzzle that is Rick Blaine. Claude Rains' role as the jovial and mild mannered captain of the police is often under-appreciated. He is the arbiter of the political tension in Rick's bar, with his profession of feigned neutrality that eventually becomes genuine empathy, even he succumbing to that same temptation of redemption that Bogart's character goes through. Casablanca is after all a romance, and like Captain Renault, many expected a romance. On the second time around, that ghostly stare of Rick and the nervous smile of Ilsa become laced with much more tension than the first time because our expectations of the film are no longer shackling us from believing of that sunset ending. There's so much to be taken from the two lead's performances. Bogart is enigmatic is his first romantic role outside of his usual typecast. He portrays Rick with a sense of cynicism and disillusionment that speaks for itself; why else would a man remain in Casablanca, on the brink of invasion? We never find out why he has been barred from returning to America, nor do we get that fateful ending of the taking of the city, but we know from Bogart that Rick is man who sticks out his neck for nobody. Opposite him is the radiant Bergman, so often in the right of frame as she considered her left side the better of the two. Her beauty is enhanced by Edeson's used of a softening gauze filter and catch lighting to further add nuance to her character; each wayward glance, each subtle eye catch with Rick is full of humanity and tenderness. Bergman emotes so effortlessly that we can gaze into her gleaming or glistening eyes with ease and see scenes of Paris racing through her mind, and this is even before we witness that famous flashback with Steiner's stirring theme ushering us into a dreamlike memory (on a second viewing of course).Last of the top billing is Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, the identified hero of the story. It's been often said that he is the weaker link of the acting, that perhaps his character is less substantial within the love story that Rick and Ilsa fleetingly have. But Laszlo is a vital piece of the film and the moral centre that drives the changes in our other characters. In that famous battle of the bands where a rousing round of La Marseillaise brings even the despairing Yvonne to tears, we admire Laszlo for his bravery and defiance but also Rick for his sly nod of approval. Wasn't this a man who only stuck out for himself? Later, in a sub-plot that is nevertheless important and evocative, a woman from Bulgaria approaches him with obvious fear and apprehension. She is desperate to obtain exit visas for her and her husband and even subtly offers sexual favours in return. Rick is unable to disarm her intentions or convince her otherwise, but decides to help her in his own way: 'Have you tried 22 tonight?' This little gesture not only points to Rick's changing sympathies but also tells us about other characters; see the gleeful reaction of Carl the waiter, or the observation of this act of goodwill by Renault. Casablanca is full of little moments that tell us lots about our characters. Ilsa arrives at night to plead with Rick for the papers that will grant their freedom away from the city. Rick refuses and when he turns back around, it's not an seductive open dress that we might expect from other films, but a gun pointed at his chest. Ilsa is so in denial she cannot afford a moment of weakness towards her former lover, so desperate for those papers. She admires Laszlo for his many deeds, but cannot say I love you in the same vein as the way she says it to Rick. Despite it's troubled writing history, Casablanca has one of the finest scripts in film history. Curtiz's direction is impeccable and fully serves the narrative; there isn't a single shot that doesn't contain visual storytelling. An anguished Rick sits in his dim office, the chiaroscuro lighting illuminating his despair against the dark backdrop as the loyal Sam plays a simple rendition of As Time Goes By, leading into the score swelling as we fade into Paris. The Production Code of Hollywood at the time forbade an ending of Ilsa departing with Rick as it would depict a married woman leaving her husband, an immoral act. And how ironic that ruling turned out to be, because it's the self-sacrifice of Rick which ensures that magnificent ending. Love, after all, does not conquer everything. But we'll always have Paris.",10,1,2,27 August 2015
Lifeboat," My name is Schmidt, but I changed it to Smith.
","Alfred Hitchock's Lifeboat will almost immediately draw comparisons with Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men. Both almost exclusively take place in a singular location. Both focus on a group of characters confronted with moral dilemma and how their biases, experiences and emotions bubble under and take control of them. It is unusual then, for Hitchock's film to be the lesser one in the art of suspense. 12 Angry Men had a remarkable ability of building up tension within the space and through Lumet's manipulation of focal length, and then finally washing away the heat and stress with rain. Lifeboat floats more breezily along, because inherently there are large gaps that the plot demands to have, being lost at sea. The setting holds it back; it is not nearly an incisive a demonstration of space and composition as something like Rear Window, and because filming at sea was not viable, the characters seem to be half-removed from the background of the endless oceans. Sure, the frame and the boat is continually rocking, and they are pelted with water and wind during the storms, but because Hitchock lacks the ability to pull out (or even swivel around), the master shot is always locked in, and the boat seems to be rooted to the small spot of water, hardly moving at all.Still, the absence of the traditional score is a nice touch, in that the characters are left with only the soft, incessant lapping of the waves throughout to haunt them. So they can see as far as the eye can see, but it is only water, water and more water, so like the juror's room, the setting closes in claustrophobically, and gives rise to all sorts of conflict. The problem is simple: the American and British are asked to share a lifeboat with a German sailor, only moments are both vessels have been sunk. Opinions immediately start flying about; once a German always a German, the Nuremberg defense, the American vs the Christian way of thinking. Radioman Sparks thinks he should be subject to the proper authoritative procedures, whereas the Army nurse Alice can't understand why there must be so much killing in the world (baffling then, to end up in this line of work). The older, venerable characters are set up as the moral compasses; the good Christian Rittenhouse, and the worldly columnist Connie Porter. And so Hitchcock must inevitably engineer the downfall of their grace and goodwill.The characterisations are muddled because apart from the clear path set for these two, the other inhabitants of the boat mill about in the background and don't change much (including the literal milling about of the steward Joe, pushed to the metaphorical back of the boat and only called upon to utilise his 'natural' light fingers). The crewman Kovac is initially the most volatile of them all, even more villainous than the Nazi they have just pulled aboard, and takes charge of the boat's direction only because of his own ignorance and spite (even if he is right). Later, out of his compassion for his friend, he finally relents, but after that is content to simply sit back and watch the proceedings play out. There are little bursts of littler consequences; the anger of card cheating fizzles out almost immediately, and Connie loses her mind for a split second...only to be lying in the lap of Kovac the next. There is some drunken attempt at philosophising from Gus, but the most intriguing character must be the German, Willi. Walter Slezak has the sort of face you might trust, if it were not for the circumstances, and his jovial, ever-smiling outlook while rowing against the current almost allows the others to let their guard down. Willi has mastered the knack for pretending he isn't listening in on the English quarrels, so as Hitchock layers the profiles of his cast so that they are all facing the camera, there he is in the background, with a determined absent-mindedness about his expression, constantly swiveling and marvelling at the empty sky. It is a triumph in blocking for such a limited space, and Slezak dominates it. He sings merrily all day, not even a slight sign of tiring, and in the night cruelly goads a man to seek the depths of the ocean for relief ('Remember your name is Schidmt'). Critics were not happy about this, especially in the midst of the war. How could a Nazi be so resourceful, so sneaky, so clever? But Hitchock respects his villain, building him up as someone who could be an ally in a desperate time, and also making him despicable enough to warrant the fury that sends him overboard with a few solid whacks of the boot from the gentle industrialist Ritt. An inhuman act surely, but is it justified? Very tricky indeed. One last question: does the directorial tag of Hitchock ultimately hurt or better it?",7,0,0,20 August 2016
Training Day," Strong safety, huh?
","Ethan Hawke has made a career out of perfecting the nervous smile and candid shake of the head. Even as he gets older he has retained that youthful naivety about him. In Lord of War I noted he was woefully miscast as the FBI hotshot - Hawke is not the arrogant, in control type. In Training Day he is a different brand of law enforcement, where his character plays to his strengths. In the beginning Jake Hoyt feigns confidence and ambition, but soon after is immediately wringing his hands and vibrating with a nervous energy because of the things he is being asked to do (he put this aura to great use as the fresh faced teenager in Before Sunrise). Hawke is like a modern Jack Lemmon, but dropped into a urban, unforgiving environment and a tireless role. His body is withered and lean, with a scratchy, unkempt beard as a symptom of long nights. He represents a rat, a narcotics cops scurrying over to the dark side. Alonzo Harris is his opposite, who shares the same traits as Hoyt that might sooner mistake him for a dealer instead of a cop. Washington is relentless to the point of being overblown; with his skullcap, black 'matrix style' trenchcoat, silver crucifix necklace and penchant for double wielding pistols (with one aligned in the 'kill-shot' position), he treads the dangerous line between authenticity and the Hollywood vision of the edgy, corrupt cop. His dialogue is fast and furious, showcasing his 'street' knowledge and his wielding of racial capital to play both sides of the thin blue line closely, and often recklessly. In another world it would be easy to imagine him as a drug kingpin. It is this approach that leads to Hoyt's first challenge. Harris underlines the offer with a bit of wisdom that makes so much sense that almost makes up for his methods: to be a narc you must know and love the drug. The second part of his nefarious plan is to lace the joint with PCP and create a trial of evidence that will later come into play. The 'drug vision', shot from the perspective of the dazed Hoyt, is where the film shows some of its false colours. It's ridiculous, highlighted with a nightmarish green tint, canted dutch angle and erratic shaky-cam straight out of some Don't Do Drugs PSA for a high school crowd. The nauseous combo with extreme close-ups barrelling in on the young rookie's reactions are part of Fuqua's treatment of 'realism', albeit a shiny, sanitised version of working narcotics. Occasionally, he even is allowed to splurge, and the result of this is a dramatic rooftop meeting of similarly corrupt cops about to raid an informant, or as they call it, 'cashing in an account'. We understand that each of the four have gone through the same trial by fire that Hoyt is being pushed through. But what's wrong with a Starbucks?The ideal behind Hawke's Hoyt is a good one, if not simplistic. An early scene tacks a wife and child onto him like some sort of moral compass point, but not as part of a three dimensional character. He's an amalgamation of the characteristics that we and Hollywood like to see often in movies - white, middle class, young father, morally upright. Fuqua aligns the audience alongside him, and we nod and agree with his moral choices, before all that is upended and we discover that the streets operate on an entirely different level than the cinematic black and whites we are so used to. But the film also falls victim at the same crux. It posits that sometimes the bad guys win and that simple morality might not always be such an easy out, but then lets the angelic protagonist navigate the messy and heartless territory it has worked so hard to establish with relative ease and a few convenient narrative strokes. Training Day recalls other tangled crime dramas about figures trying to navigate the corrupt waters of the system, in particular the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and its more well known western counterpart, The Departed. While the former wears its pulp on its sleeve by using a flashy action aesthetic and showy, soap-opera-esque flashbacks to push the narrative along, the latter was well and truly americanised. As with many of Scorsese's films it verges on the point of being overdone, stretched an extra fifty minutes and made gritty, grey and quietly devastating. A distinct difference lies in the treatment of the undercover gang member who infiltrates the police system: the original had a way of swinging allegiances and evoking Buddhist sentiments of a perpetual guilt, whilst Scorsese all but batters Matt Damon into the ground, leaving no room for dispute. Interestingly, Training Day was released but a month after the 9/11 attacks, with the American public distraught, and fear and paranoia running rampant. In that climate a cop could do no wrong. Nowadays I look around and see a very different environment, one where the lessons of Training Day might not be so shocking. While the two former films are more or less straight thrillers, Training Day attempts to say a little more, but it's not entirely successful either.",7,0,0,15 November 2016
In Bruges," It's like a f*cking fairytale
","The first thing you realise about In Bruges is that it's a very good tourist advertisement for the city. It's almost too easy for the set designer; lavish old churches amongst medieval architecture, cobblestone streets, gorgeous canals, a dainty market square. Beneath the beautiful setting is a dark and twisted comedy that manages to say quite a lot. Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's dialogue is at times reminiscent of Pulp Fiction's, being snappy, cynical, often irrelevant. But it's very important in establishing the relationship between two hit men in Ray and Ken.Farrell gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the younger of the pair. The opening narration tells us of his cardinal sin in murder, but it's much later that we find out that he also accidentally killed an innocent young boy in the process, and that it was his first contracted kill. Farrell manages to portray these without ever explicitly telling the audience. His performance is one of great range and character; on the surface he is bored, impatient, brutally dismissive, honest (that American did have a heart attack at the top of the tower), and cynical. But there's also moments of innocence and wonder and childhood that he exhibits which makes it more clear the gravity of his situation and sin. At heart Ray is not a bad man, simply one on the wrong path. Ken (Brendon Gleeson) is the only one who recognises this. There's not too much in common with the pair; snappy exchanges showcase the very apparent difference between the two's idea of a good holiday and just a waste of time. McDonagh manages to give a visually breathtaking and interesting tour of Bruges all while establishing the relationship and the plot. They discuss heaven, hell and purgatory at the art museum, a thin veil for the hit men's pondering of morality, and clash when Ray refuses to go up and see the view at the bell tower while Ken pays his 5 Euro. Each scene of the tightly knitted screenplay is crucial to the climax of the film, every last detail significant. There's a running motif between the criminals of the film in the pair and their boss, Harry. Ralph Fiennes plays a calm but unbalanced mob boss, unflinching in his duty but all the same possessing a moral compass like the other two. McDonagh expresses this with humorous dialogue which is driven purely by character. Both Harry and Ray are impulsively violent when need be but in sight of the pregnant Marie, their softer personalities come out. It's a clever and almost exasperating scene which wouldn't normally be in a film, as they time the start of their action sequence in unison. There is clearly a line that even these men won't cross. Ken reaches this with the realisation of Ray's impeding suicide, despite initially agreeing to kill him as a result of his debt to Harry. It's a wonderfully ironic twist which again is driven by wonderful acting and dialogue: 'I'm not allowed to and you are? How's that fair?' All three characters possess an underlying complexity beyond just the simply criminal life of killing people. Ken doesn't even commit any murders in the entire film; in fact only killing himself in an attempt to save Ray. His life debt, trust and integrity to Harry is undone when he realises that the reasonably untainted Ray has the capacity to be something better. No more prominent an example of the code that they possess is Harry's suicide at the end which hammers down the main thematic virtue. The sort of innocence and purity that is symbolically represented in the boy and seen in glimpses of Ray must remain clean of bloodstain and ruin. Harry kills himself when realising what he's done; ironically the victim is the very opposite of the ideal, a drug addicted dwarf who hires prostitutes. The significant act is in Ray, who frantically tries to correct this act and spare Harry even as he is dying by his hand. Ray's characters progression is complex, foreshadowed and consequential. Even whining endlessly at the beginning at being stuck in Bruges for two weeks, he shows no real purpose, desire or destination. His ambitions are simple and sensual in nature: chasing after a beautiful women and stealing drugs. This aimless perspective is marred by the sincerity of the guilt at the back of his mind, showcased sparingly but in raw and genuine moments of emotional regret by Farrell, like when he breaks down at the playground. In the ambulance he finally decides on a goal: to find the mother of the boy and accept her punishment. It's the first time in the entire film we see resolve to live and it's the culmination of the hints of moral goodness that we know Ray is possible of. The ending is purposefully ambiguous on whether he does manage to reach that goal, much better than the one in the original screenplay which has him contemplating suicide once again only to hesitate when Chloe rings him. For Ray, the fairytale city of Bruges is a complete nightmare. It's a 2 week purgatory which constantly eats away at his conscience and reminds him of his guilt. One way or another, he must escape. In Bruges manages to deftly balance the light-hearted humorous side of the situation and of the characters with the subtext of self-hatred, anguish and cardinal sin. It's a thematically complex character study filled with stark juxtapositions of the poignant and the absurd. Most will find it as charming as the fairytale city that it is set in.",9,0,0,20 June 2015
Gravity," You just point the damned thing at Earth. It's not rocket science.
","The major advantage of having much of Gravity being digitally rendered digitally are those gorgeous and frightening long takes, none more impressive than the 17 minute unbroken opening shot. The camera moves with such a deliberate stillness and calming influence reminiscent of 2001, the inflated average shot length unveiling the world of outer space with ease and beauty and a sense of real time. That last element is very crucial in building tension in the foreground of the gorgeous Blue Marble that occupies much of the background in the 90 minutes. Cuarón never relents, whether it's a gracefully silent and serene shot of Stone in a fetal position symbolising a baby in the womb, umbilical cord and all, or through the chaotic barrage of space debris. Lubezki's camera movement is never needlessly dizzying or disorientating, somewhere that many films falter, and that makes it all the more panicked when Price's foreboding and dominant score chimes in. The lack of the necessity to cut is used by Cuarón sparingly and to great effect; midway after surviving the first barrage, Stone discovers the lack of fuel stores in the Soyuz and starts cursing and hitting out in anger, before a well placed cut immediately silences her screams and the score and starts a slow zoom out, re-contextualising the claustrophobia of the spacesuit and the small space-pod within the vast endless swathes of space. Of course it wouldn't be all possible to empathise without the wonderfully fragile performance of Sandra Bullock. Clooney plays the senior astronaut, the assured and confident voice in the chaos who tries to calm Stone and keep her focused even as all hope seems lost. It's a familiar role for Clooney and he plays it well, perhaps with a little too much ease for one in such a perilous situation, but anyhow Bullock is the stand out here. Her endless little monologue to herself is quiet yet spirited, never feeling like forced exposition. There's great emotion from a thin back-story; my favourite scene of the film involves her quiet contemplation of her imminent death, picking up a tiny strand of humanity through the radio. She finds the non English speaking Aningaaq, and they communicate with the only mutual sound they can, the soft howls of dogs, and find a brief connection via the cry ofThere are a few tiny little bumps along the teleological narrative that slightly hurt the overall film. Price's score is imposing and the electronic pulses add much intensity to the silent wastelands of outer space, but are bombastic at times, most notably just before the climatic descent and right after Stone finally reaches land and stands upright for the first time in the film. It's slightly overwhelming and guilty of exaggerating the danger of the scenes at times, although these moments can be papered over unlike in other cases (Interstellar comes to mind). Of course there's also the myriad of plot holes and scientific inaccuracies I'm sure that many fellow IMDb users have listed and complained about endlessly, but those should and must be brushed aside in a film like Gravity. It's a growing symptom of modern film criticism to be easily inclined to refuse to suspend our disbelief and be outraged at a piece of non fiction's lack of complete logically coherence. Despite ourselves living in such a world where people panic and make mistakes, although few will have been in the situation of Stone's. I've been told that Gravity is a magnificent film to watch on the big screen, and even more of a marvel in 3D. Unfortunately I probably won't ever experience that sort of wonder (3D makes me dizzy) but even on a small screen Cuarón pulls off a spectacle. Despite being 90 minutes long and focused exclusively on a single, linear storyline, it never drags or rushes and paces itself evenly. Gravity is a film simultaneously taunt with both terror and beauty, never relenting on its chaos and frenzy.",8,3,5,17 August 2015
Mulan," Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns!
","This is one of the excellent animations from the Disney Renaissance that mixes Chinese legend with the typical Hollywood elements, but unlike many animations it weaves them together well. You never really see Mushu as anyone other than the wisecracking Eddie Murphy (just as evident as in Shrek, although it is a little more appropriate there) but he manages to create humour and show that he cares for Mulan in little moments such as the assistance in the training montage. The three stooges in Yao, Ling and Chien-Po provide the other comic relief, and they do it well. How lovable and gentle is the giant Chien-Po? (Beef! Pork! Chicken! Mhmm!) Then there are the elements of Chinese culture that do not overburden the narrative but provide a strong basis for the conflict within Fa Mulan. The idea of saving face means her father is too proud to let a woman take her place in the army, and that same sentiment is seen throughout the society. The soundtrack is as good as any from the Renaissance. We first get an inkling of how out of place Mulan is in the opening number Honour to Us All, which is a playful percussive piece that uses Asian influenced guzheng and flute to match the physical comedy of Mulan's incompetence in the female domain. That is later backed up by the heartfelt Reflection by Lea Salonga. In Blossoms, it starts off slow and meditative, before the orchestration and fanfare create a powerful moment in the storm where Mulan takes off with armour and sword, aided by the slow but tense beats of the bass. The centrepiece however is the rousing I'll Make a Man Out of You, everyone's favourite Disney song that gets you out of your seat. It is simply impossible to not feel pumped up by this montage; the beat is infectious, the lyrics are ridiculous, the sing-along potential unlimited.The animation style is simple enough and the art design elegantly creates the Han period. There is a stunning wide shot within the battle scene where Shan Yu charges as a single solitary figure behind the rest of the army amongst the snow, before Mulan creates an avalanche and the scene becomes a literal ocean of flowing snow. I am reminded of the chaotic wildebeest stampede in Lion King only a few years back, and here as well 2D animation becomes 3D, and the scale and theatrics of the entire action piece are spectacular. It is here that Mulan shows her heroics despite her gender, and that also being the cause for her exile. It becomes easy to recognise the bravery and courage of Mulan in such a male dominated society. And just beneath that, there is the little domestic conflict of her parents wanting her to marry off to a suitable match. This was an entirely different era; without Mulan there would be no Merida, no Rapunzel, no Elsa and Anna. Mulan follows the same sorts of formulas that many kids animation films still follow today, but despite some rather pained humour in some parts (the entire character of Chi-Fu, especially with the accent, is rather embarrassing, and Mushu gets a little weary at times - although the grandma is just absolutely precious), underneath there's a genuine narrative with some pretty important themes going on. And there's always something for the kids to sing along to.",8,1,2,23 October 2015
The Big Lebowski," The Dude Abides
","The Big Lebowski starts and ends with narrative voice-over, which seems to be out of place. A well-moustached stranger with a cowboy hat chronicles mysteriously and tenderly a tale for the times, and tumbleweed blows through not great lonely western plains, but down- town Los Angeles. Yes, the City of Angels itself, but the glitter is often substituted for the gritty in those noir detective works. The Texan acts as a filter; he doesn't approve of the Dude's profanity or laziness, but then again, isn't the hero of these stories supposed to be a morally ambiguous figure? This is not the Golden Age of detective novels. The Coens throw Bridges knee deep into this love letter of sorts to the great noirs. It is set in urban California much like The Big Sleep, but the Dude is not the hard-boiled detective, harbouring darks thoughts and living endlessly on a cigarette. He is unemployed, dressed in a bathrobe instead of a trenchcoat, and lives on White Russians and pot. There is a clever shot where he contemplates himself in the mirror of a TIME cover. The whole narrative is set into motion not by his own motivations, but by the bickering of his best friend Walter. John Goodman plays the impulsive live-wire veteran, who has the ability to spin any conversation into one concerning war, patriotism and freedom; Donny's eulogy is sorely lacking. The trio lovingly frequent a bowling alley which houses an assortment of plucky figures, instead of a seedy and neon-defaced bar which spits out slow jazz. When a gun gets pulled out, or any sort of violence whatsoever, the Dude protests. When he is confronted by the bizarre bowling rival/sex offender in Jesus, he has no witty comeback but manages to mumble out one of his classic lines. We delve into deeper mysteries. A rogue phone-call leads Lebowski to the film's femme fatale as he meanders up a dark alleyway. She is given an apt introduction, swinging wildly as she dabbles in abstract erotic art and speaks pointedly about gender truths in a British accent. As tradition states, they sleep together, but it isn't the desperate romantic affair we expect. Later, Lebowski follows up on another lead on a well-dressed and spoken millionaire (that is to say, he is hauled there against his will), and the architecture is sleek, modern, intimidating. The Dude lounges with his White Russian. The Coens question the genre with every turn. We have strange characters like Maude's sophisticated bald friend, who laughs with high pitched derision but does not harbour evil plans. A covert car follows him around the film, and ends up being a rather nervous private investigator who is thrilled to meet another PI of such great talent and ability (which speaks about his own competence). The Dude is bamboozled with over-elaborate demands in a increasingly complex and twisted kidnapping plot, and fails to complete any of them. In a rare instance where he takes action, the camera eagerly zooms upon a hastily written and cryptic message. The Coens parody a similar scene in Hitchcock's North by Northwest here, but the Dude finds not a vital clue, but a crude drawing of an erection. The opening credits lovingly detail the bowling alley and all its regulars to the tune of Bob Dylan. There are other dream-like sequences which increasingly up the chaos, and in another film they might lead to some sort of bigger picture or unearth some grand conspiracy, but here it just leads to more profanity-laden demands for explanation. They are stylised with great care and hint at the noir influence, but perhaps through the lens of the Dude's stoner lifestyle; being crushed by a giant bowling ball which spins in a dizzying POV, running raggedly in the night while being backlit by police cars, and an elaborate interpretive dance number set to the counter-culture tune Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In). Elsewhere Maude romantically confronts the hero of the story by looking down at him and upside down in a moment of incompetence, friends encounter a piece of 'culture' at the dance recital (but how loyal is the Dude!), and in a scarce moment of clarity and realisation, the Holmes figure reveals all via a dramatic flashback which visualises the murky millionaire figure in ominous shadows and a lightning storm. Of course, the essence of film noir is that our characters are trapped within a world of chaos and moral greys and indifference, only here our hero is beyond ordinary, and somehow stumbles upon the right answer despite his incompetence and laid-back approach. It is here that Coens extract much of the humour. Bridges stutters his way through an explanation of why he has neither ransom nor kidnappee. He crudely constructs a device to stop the frequent intrusions, only to have the door open the other way, and then later trips on the plank himself. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as a spineless and obedient servant who lavishes praise upon his master and echoes his sentiments in a very moderate manner. A little boy is remarkably stone faced, and Walter, who takes every transgression as an affront on himself and America, over-reacts in the most hilarious way, and is shocked to find he has targeted the wrong car. Later he attempts to unveil a conspiracy, but ends up dumping a disabled man onto the floor. And in that climatic 'fight', a bowling ball is substitute for a mace and Donny dies of a heart attack, his ashes blowing in the wind, and the Dude's face. Next week he goes bowling, and forgets about the whole affair. You know, strikes and gutters.",9,1,3,27 October 2015
Unbreakable," They called me Mr Glass
","Every little boy wants to believe that their dad is invincible. At some point in their infancy, they might very well believe in the fact. For young Joseph, it becomes a tiny spark amongst whispers of divorce and separation. We open on a conversation on a train - the woman feels a hint of flirting, and we are not sure the status of David's marriage, but he hastily apologizes for being too forward, but it is too late. This scene, and many others in the movie, showcases Shyamalan's talent for his frames within frames; the camera situated in front of the pair, peering through the slit between the seats, and roving back and forth, in an unbroken take. And then later, to demonstrate that something is wrong with the train, he uses a tiny little clue; David peering down the line and seeing something clutch for dear life onto the armrest. It is confident visually. See another notable unbroken shot, where the camera spins around the entire hospital waiting room to emphasises the scale of the tragedy and loss of the crash, and how Shyamalan just holds it for long enough to express how awe-inspiring and mysterious that he is the sole survivor. He contrasts the dark tone of the film with these inappropriately lurid colour schemes that are slightly filtered with a griminess for realism; green for David, purple for Elijah, as if to signal their allegiance, and to nod to the comic- book influence with its bold, striking images. Opposing the modern trend of flashy, in-your-face superhero movies, it never feels the need to wow the audience with its superpowers and special effects. That comes near the end, where Shyamalan slightly overcompensates with the unmistakable imagery of the poncho billowing in the wind like a cape, and carrying Audrey up to bed like a Lois Lane to his Superman. The human and emotional element, which normally might take a back- seat to the cool powers and effects, is exceptionally well integrated. The wife and son are not pushed to the side but brilliantly woven into the story. See the heartbreaking scene where Wright confesses she wants to start over, because she sees his miraculous survival as some sort of sign, a second chance for their marriage. It is sweet to see them nervous as they go through the first date questions all over again. And a child willing to shoot his father might be absurd in most cases, but it works here. His motive is understandable, and David's threats of moving away are the grounded reasoning that the scene needs to build to a climax, and then wither, to our relief. And yet, there is a small part of us that wants to see it happen, to provide us with some evidence and kick the film into action. We see a little hint of it initially, with how they carefully build his strength via the weightlifting scene, and how the camera seems to move with the bar, as if David was lifting the whole frame with him. But Shyamalan wisely knows that David is not ready, and postpones the reveal.Elijah, the villain of the movie, is delicately crafted. Jackson refuses the urge to go overboard is his performance; it is slightly eccentric, but he has enough awareness to ease the tension with humour, and not be completely diabolical. Shyamalan is smart enough to make him sympathetic while not overdoing the concealed bitterness and anger of his existence - as he chases down a man, he comes to a long flight of stairs, and the soundtrack turns shrill, and haphazardly zooms out to highlight the danger of such a mundane setting to Elijah. We feel for how dangerous this is and how sick he must be of the constant hospital visits and rehab, even as we frantically want to catch the man and reveal his secret. As he falls, it is with a dizzying, painful potency. And when that classic Shyamalan plot twist is revealed, we almost feel for how he has been treated and his desperate desire to find a truer purpose. He screams that they kids used to call him 'Mr Glass', and the line between cartoonish and realism has been immaculately tread.",8,0,2,27 February 2016
As Good as It Gets," We held each other!
","As Good as It Gets is directed by James L. Brooks, who has always had a good eye for characters beyond merely how the plot's cause and effect drive them. In Terms of Endearment it was two single women, pushing back against judgy social circles and vying for each other's approval as a third generation beckoned. Broadcast News was about juggling romance and professionalism in the corporate world of TV news journalism. It had satiric bite, but also a good heart underneath and an honesty towards its characters. More recently there was Spanglish, which had so much potential in surveying the loss of culture and control in the context of a maid's daughter within a wealthy American family and upbringing, but which fizzled out into straight romance. Jack Nicholson stars in As Good as It Gets as an OCD obsessed recluse disturbed by his gay neighbour and black art dealer. Though initially we think Melvin is a nasty racist and homophobe, eventually we come to realise he is an equal opportunity misanthrope. In one of his more prickly performances, Nicholson gingerly steps between the pavement cracks of New York, waddling around like a fat penguin, and hurls abuse so casually that we are shocked someone hasn't yet taken a shot at him (or ejected him from his favoured cafe). He types romance and love novels but doesn't practice what he preaches. Yet behind that cruel smile and open hostility is really just a scared little boy lashing out at what he doesn't understand - like something out of a School Bullying 101 manual from decades ago, he shrinks when Frank confronts, and is later coddled like a tantrum-prone child acting out by the only one who can handle him, his usual waitress Carol. 'Behave!', she tells him while wagging her finger, and when he says something unredeemable, the whole cafe goes silent, and she draws a line in the sand, and it seems he has a line too. This power imbalance is why the eventual romance is hard to swallow. Does Mervin merely shut up because he couldn't bear not having his usual meal in the usual location, or does he really understand the gravity of what he has just said? His payment of the sick son's medical bills straddles the same argument, and again and again throughout the film, he aims barbed insults so casually, and resets his progress towards redemption. The whole process is so infuriating we begin to wonder why someone like Carol, with seemingly unlimited pools of patience and empathy, still sticks around to see him finally become some semblance of a decent human being. Not only does she baby the misbehaving Melvin, but one-night stands also turn into askew affairs, her dabbing the shirt of her date like a toddler at feeding time. They are worlds apart. One of Melvin's little steps sees him begrudgingly take care of his neighbour's dog and like something out of a Disney movie, come to eventually love and care for Verdell - after all, you can't be racist to a dog, can you? He won't even touch people, but he smothers the Brussels Griffon with affection squeezed out from the deepest chasms of his hardened heart. Meanwhile he is bullying Verdell's owner, literally hitting the man as he is down. Some of the insults are as clever as they are cruel ('You'll be back on your knees in no time') and again we marvel at how casually nasty he can be. Though the script aims to warm our hearts, it more than often disarms us with sudden tonal shifts; the next day he's knocking at the door with hot soup, and just about the only compliment Melvin ever gives Simon is directed at his tidiness: 'Nice packing.' He exists in a conservative dog-eat-dog world where everyone fends for themselves, and where there are no helping hands and no free sympathies. He treats Carol's letter of gratitude like an infectious disease, and Nicholson stares at Hunt as if she was an alien: how could his innocuous act result in someone being so open and exposed? And yet she beats herself up for doing so, for putting her dignity above her son's wellbeing, and in a heartbreaking moment, punishes herself for being so selfish, for wanting companionship and normalcy away from sickness. Could Melvin ever have this much self-awareness, this much compassion? Simon says: 'Don't force him.' He wants Verdell to come over of his own accord. And the audience wants Melvin to make the same steps, not because he has been prodded along and lectured on what is right and wrong, but through his own judgement. And I think eventually, he does make it there.",6,0,2,19 February 2017
Memento," Now..where was I?
","Many critics have expressed the view that the backwards chronological order of the colour sequences of Memento is nothing more than a gimmick, a story-telling device that doesn't align with Leonard's point of view. After all, he certainly doesn't experience events in backwards order, does he? However, this structure is crucial in many ways in Memento presenting its story. The narrative is fundamentally about self deception and betrayal; Leonard sees it from everyone he knows, right down to the inn manager who tries to rent him two rooms and freely admits to it, knowing Leonard won't remember. The structure deliberately denies the audience the same information that Leonard is denied as a result of his condition, and slowly subverts initial expectations and reveals facts as lies, as the motif of memory is constantly discussed. Leonard doesn't trust himself or his memory - he works on instincts and conditioning, and most of all, the little notes and tattoos he carries. The audience, much like Leonard, willfully submits to their truth. Playing Memento chronologically would remove this set-up and all the confusion and suspense that he rightly feels. Tt would remove the emotional payoff and complexity in the scene which foreshadows his darker motivations, where he hires a hooker to arrange a room and wake him up, yearning for one small moment where his wife still might be alive. Dorn edits with precision within these colour segments in order to nod to the backwards order, if the first scene doesn't immediately tell us that, or an alive Teddy right after his death. Key actions and scenarios from the end (and thus beginning) of each scene are neatly stitched together to portray the cause and effect of Leonard's journey and the instructions of his mementos. But the reveal of each character's deception of Lenny (including himself) would not be as effective without the excellent casting. The film comes right after the hugely successful Matrix, where Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano play a trustworthy protagonist and deceptive antagonist respectively. The genius of this is that it subconsciously sets up our expectations for these two characters; we know nothing about them, like Lenny, so we are forced to trust the little notes and clues and their performances. Moss plays a wonderfully exposed and vulnerable character, stumbling into the house with signs of injury...before it is later revealed that it was Lenny who inflicted them as she hurled profanities and insults at him. Teddy is shown to be the villain from the very first scene but later is revealed to be assisting Leonard's quest for revenge. Of course, they aren't too cut and dry. Teddy's corruption and drug deals slides seamlessly into the Natalie's side of the story; he shows manipulative (phone calls) but also caring actions towards Lenny. Natalie, realising that Lenny doesn't remember anything about acquiring her dead boyfriend's car and clothes, sleeps with him. Of course the backwards colour scenes would not have the same effect if they weren't separated and paced by the chronological black and white scenes, which start with the opposite tone. Whereas every colour scene Leonard wakes up with no memory and has to restart his brain and focus on his next move, the B&Ws start with an almost objective sense. Nolan shoots in a documentary-like style, the almost droning voice-over of Lenny feels like reading a script, narrating a story or sound-bites from an interview. Extreme close ups demonstrate disorientation and confusion while the overhead, surveillance camera-like angle focuses the scene objectively. They start with Leonard almost devoid of motivation or outside intrusion, but slowly shift throughout the film, as he begins to question who exactly he is speaking to on the phone and what he is being asked to do. This sets up the culmination of the two levels converging into a very clever shot where the colour emerges just as Leonard shakes the polaroid. There's been plenty of debate on the veracity of Teddy's confession in Memento's climax. Taking it as it is, it's the catalyst for the movie's themes to converge and manifest into the decision of Leonard to start the whole chase for Teddy, which ends with his death at the start of the film. Having being deceived by ever other character himself, he deliberately sets up his own deception and consciously alters the truth. He burns the evidence of the two former John Gs (who knows how many have been erased) and decides on a new John G. Like waking up to his deceased wife's mementos and thinking for a fleeting second that she is alive, Leonard yearns for that same satisfaction in revenge. He conditions himself to believe so - my wife wasn't diabetic, he says, as his memory flickers and the insulin needle is altered to a finger, or the very quick flash of himself in the mental institution instead of Sammy. But that's okay - his memory has covered up those instances. It's a remarkable transition from the sometimes clueless but passionately motivated Lenny that Guy Pearce delivers from the beginning. Memento is tightly wound - it's edits never linger for more than the necessary time in order to orientate its audience for just the tiny amount - it's paramount for us to be as confused as Leonard, even as we slowly unlock the puzzle. Every note, tattoo or fragment of information is then disclosed with much more suspense and revelation than a chronological structure would allow. Each 10 minute memory segment then is able to build and sustain upon the twist ending with haunting implications. How many more Teddys? How many more John Gs?",9,1,3,30 July 2015
Zootopia," Sly fox. Dumb bunny.
","The few apparent critical lapses in Zootopia range around the fact that its satirical segments are less accurate and immediate than Disney would have liked them to be. This film, even with the universal motivational message, is very much a product of its time, hitting areas like prejudice, gender (animal) roles and stereotyping at a period where they are all the rage - and that includes the backlash that inevitably comes with them. Some are of the opinion that Zootopia's parallels are unfounded and its pre-conceived notions of its predators justified; after all carnivores must eat other animals to survive - it is, like Judy says, within their biology. And others have lambasted the film for attacking prejudiced yet benefiting from those very stereotypes they admonish for a quick laugh; lemmings as the desk workers, wolves unable to resist a howl, bunnies multiply like mad. But by the end of the film it has been established that this is an advanced society - they all walk on two legs, and predators don't eat others anymore, and it was all a big scare so that the prey proletariat could rise up and take over the remaining of Zootopia. And it is easy enough to realise that the core of the film's message doesn't attack stereotyping altogether, but rather the prejudice that leads to little bunnies and foxes being compartmentalised and told off for straying from their pre-determined path. Zootopia is of course visually stunning. I am continually impressed by how much each major animation studio continues to push the boundaries of what can be put onto the screen for audiences to marvel at; Pixar led the way with Sully's individually rendered hairs and it has been improved here so much so that the main characters are remarkably expressive. A twitch of the nose, a droop in the ears, the raising and lowering of eyebrows - the animators have complete control of the facial expression and therefore the emotions that are created from them (a key moment being Judy welling up in tears as well as Goodwin emotionally breaking down - so effective because there is no dramatic or clever speech, no easy way out but to simply admit her wrong and ask for forgiveness). The world of Zootopia has been crafted with great detail and care. The film's most effective scene is something that must be experienced on the big screen - Judy's first entry into the wide world away from the modest BunnyBurrow, as she experiences each unique environment with its own animal settlers from a train zooming across wide swathes of desert, a frosty snowtown, a multi-layered treetop village and finally the glittery urban metropolis where 'anyone can be anything'. Even in the briefest of glimpses we experienced so much of the world because the animators have crammed in so much life into the frame: the varied-sized doors of the train, the little ice float transports, the water-way for hippos, the hamster tunnels that snake in and out of the environment. A delightful chase sequence in Little Rodentia features a mini-sized version of the same town, delicately tilt-shifted to magnify its effect.The script doesn't manage to complete outrun the clichés that come with the mish-mash of the detective mystery and kids animation. There's the expected failures that confront the bright-eyed, optimistic protagonist that wants to change the world. The policemen inevitably is asked to hand in her badge, but of course conducts her own investigation afterwards. At times the film easily betrays its existence as a mass-marketed story that must be appropriately packaged for children, who will drag their parents and their wallets to the theatre - the bully comes pre-packaged with a neat little apology, and there is no escaping from the celebrity voice cast or obligatory upbeat pop song with its vaguely cheery message. But in many ways it brings new life to the genre. It isn't as insightful as Inside Out, perhaps because humans are a little more relatable than the multitude of animals on display here, but the message is nevertheless a relevant and inspiring one. For years children's films have increasingly moved away from those happy, neatly closed off endings that are so predictable. We ask more varied and interesting challenges and questions of our protagonists, but they are not solved in the conventional way. For the adults, they will appreciate all the throwaway lines that remind us of all the silliness and exhaustion that goes into maintaining these stereotypes in our own lives. And for the kids, they hopefully walk away confident that they no longer need to listen to the voices that tell them they aren't good enough to walk one path.",8,3,6,19 June 2016
12 Monkeys," I'm in insurance.
","It is 2027, and the last of mankind has been forced underground into a makeshift colony. The production design shows us the worst of this, in the tiny prison cells, and it is reminiscent of Gilliam's dystopic Brazil, but without the towering skyscrapers and ministerial buildings locked up in infrastructure and bureaucratic messes; this future is grimy and claustrophobic. Up above, city halls and apartment buildings lay in dilapidated ruin in the snow, they leak liberally, and lions roar from corner rooftops while bears lurk below. There is less of a satirical and absurdist edge that we usually see from Gilliam in this bleak future vision, although the same stylistic devices remain; the use of a Fresnel lens warps and distorts the multiple faces of the scientists on the television screen, the wide angle lenses do the same as Cole's POV is interrogated in a mental institution bed by the past doctors, and the camera swivels around, disorientating us in the same way that Cole and his good friend Jeffrey Goines is, with overhead and dutch angles that lurk voyeuristically around, over and behind the mental patients..perhaps in some instances overly so. And there is also the dream sequence that plagues Cole throughout the film and his mission. Against the grimy backdrop of past and present, this particular scene is at a airport, and is in slow motion, but more frantic than anything else, and is bright and overexposed to haunting effect, until we are very sure that this is the setting of the climax. Something must be prevented. But 12 Monkeys constantly reiterates that the past cannot be changed, and so Cole is sent back not to prevent a calamity, but to ensure that the present day survivors have a chance of retaking the surface once again, to insure that possibility. He is sent back naked, but he is not the Terminator, cold and ruthless, but his ramblings and panicked foretelling of the coming disaster mistaken for psychotic delusions, and it is clever that Gilliam manages to make these interrogations and psychiatric evaluations so mundane, like they are lifted from any run of the mill police procedural as the detectives check out potential suspects (and there is almost always a deluded mental patient), and thus so terrifying because Cole's mission is compromised and no one is aware of the impending doom. He is shacked up with fellow mental patient Jeffrey Goines, in what is perhaps Brad Pitt's finest performance. His first words include being bribed by one of the carers with an imaginary five thousand dollars, and then he commences his grand tour of the facility, and it is wonderful how he manages to create a character so assured yet so obviously troubled. His rapid fire dialogue keys us into his nervousness as well as little clues of his family and intentions, he repeats phrases again and again, his facial tics of jerks of the head and crazy wide eyed smile present the perfect red herring for the biological virus releaser of the future. Now and then he will release in a burst of anger that hints at darkness beneath him, but it is the small scene of David Morse hidden early in the scene which reveals the real perpetrator. This is a well written time travel thriller, because it is not an easy concept to write about and construct a narrative around, having the need to construct and reinforce its own restrictions, and maintaining a sort of tension that in normal stories cannot be resolved by the ability to do it all over again. It doesn't lean on its twist reveals of Cole's origin and the Army of the 12 Monkeys' role, but they are cleverly done; a forensic report of an antique bullet, the repetition of a key covert phrase, and the reveal of a secret mission through a normal taxi conversation and the sight of giraffes ambling down the highway. Willis makes the plot frantic, because he is so sure of his mission and then he is confined, and then haunted by distorted voices in his head that make him question his whole identity and purpose altogether. We see the remnants of a lost world so clearly as he sticks his head outside the car window like a dog, breathing in the fresh and clean air, and treasuring the sound of music long lost, and it is tragic that we see that same person in his young self, seeing his own death, but not quite understanding. The ending is powerfully quiet; this calamity has already occurred, and will always occur no matter how many trips to the past they make, but perhaps there is a chance of revival.",8,1,2,3 December 2015
Au Revoir les Enfants," Au revoir les enfants
","Upon the first viewing of Au revoir les enfants, we are as engrossed into the mystery of Jean Bonnet as the young Julien Quentin is. And on a second viewing, the little clues become a great deal clearer, and we are able to piece together the puzzle a little quicker than the inquisitive young boy. But of course the modern older viewer has the frame of context and knowledge that Julien does not have - he knows the telltale signs of a Jew, but cannot figure out why they are hunted and persecuted so diligently, when all he sees is one of his close friends. And so the entire film is tinged in regret; even as Jean reminds him that he would have been caught anyway, we feel the chain of events that lead to that monumental morning being so painful to remember, and that one fatal glance that led to a death on his hand. Louis Malle works with his memories and experiences, and here he has crafted a group of young schoolboys so reminiscent and convincing. He has captured that remarkable knack and ability of young boys to be able to hastily create relationships out of nothing, sever them, and hastily mend them all over. They pipe up at any opportunity to make a joke on someone else's behalf, and take playful violence to the limit, and are all friendly the next day. And any child would remember cheering whenever they got a break from school-work - here it is within the grim context of air raids, but they cheer anyway, and when the teacher starts a prayer, they all instinctively join in. Why this succeeds is that Malle does not overdo the World War 2 setting; these boys certainly do not take the war so seriously, so he takes on that viewpoint. They playact as knights on stilts and knock each other over as real soldiers fight, but it might as well be another day for them. They trade books with dirty stories in them, and cackle at a rare viewing of Chaplin. When a German soldier stands up to a French collaborator in the restaurant and the whole establishment rallies around an elderly Jewish customer, there is an sinister undercurrent about it, but this is viewed through the innocent lens of Julien, who seems to know that what is happening is bad, and instinctively covers for his Jewish friend, but does not understand why being Jewish is bad thing. He is at the centre of the narrative, at the tender age where he is still a mummy's boy, but like many blossoming teenagers puts on a braver, cooler front: indeed his first lines to Jean are a thinly veiled threat to not mess with him. He has little moments of cheekiness and intelligence, bartering his mother's jam and pretending to drown in the bathtub to avoid the wrath of taking too long. And there is a subplot of his uncertainty around his future aspirations that links towards the courageous actions of the priest Père Jean; mentors whisper that he does not quite have the calling of priesthood, and his mother coddles and suggests taking on the same occupation as his father in engineering, and in the same vein his piano playing is not quite up to scratch, so he is recommended taking up violin. But he does have those same qualities as Père Jean anyway. A bitter Joseph mocks him for being so pious and generous when it is war and it is every man for himself - 'They're just Jews,' he spits outs. But it is the rejection of this statement by Julien that rings so true and brave - it is in those small acts of defiance, and those brief friendships that shine brightly in the darkness of the Holocaust, that our humanity remains.",8,6,6,5 March 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as time...
","No other adaptation of the classic French fairytale has come close to capturing the magic of Disney's effort. It's a gorgeous film that fully relishes in its medium; the majestic Gothic architecture of the castle, the hulking form of the beast, the charming anthropomorphic household servants etc. These all would look not half as fantastic in live action, but in one of the earliest uses of the CAPS system, are beautifully fluid, lively and detailed. It sets the tone for some very strong and complex characterisation, particularly in the case of the Beast and his servants. The Beast himself is daunting and imposing in his character design, but the animation captures a more human side of the cursed prince in actions like slumps and walks and sighs. His piercing blue eyes add depth to his wide range of facial expressions that appear in both humorous and heavy scenes. The assortment of household items also benefit from the enchanting animation. A variety of unique characters from teapots to candlesticks are designed with great care and love in order to represent real humans as closely as possible. They bounce around, they wave and cross their arms, they emote via their eyebrows. When the magic turns back the Beast and his servants into humans at the end of the film, they feel strangely alien. That's because of the ability of Disney to assign the audience's devotion and care onto inanimate objects and ugly beasts. It couldn't be more natural to fall in love with this world. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman combine again after the success of The Little Mermaid for a memorable soundtrack. Be Our Guest is a lively tune which showcases the wide cast and crazy choreography of the household servants. Gaston is appropriately set in a tavern and features hilarious antics and boasting that could only come from the main villain. As despicable as he is the lyrics are rousing and catchy, depicting a true paragon of manliness that is as irresistible as the handsome face and rippling muscles of the addressee. The show stealer however is the title theme, lovingly sung by English actress Angela Lansbury in film as a poignant moment where Belle and the Beast have their first dance. Her rendition is not as lavish or as sweet as the Dion Bryson duet, but it's earnest and simplistic. It's one of the few instances in the film where the camera is allowed to move, via a complex production sequence where the entire ballroom was created using CGI. The end result is magnificent; the camera sweeping down from the ceiling chandelier and tracking around the couple, combined with Lansbury's richly tender and warm singing voice makes for one of the most beautiful scenes of Disney history. Beauty and the Beast's story is simple but remarkably effective. The even pacing of the characterisation and narrative creates a very accessible and engaging relationship between Belle and the Beast. There are clear moments of growth and change which earmark the path to the love they share at the end. Linda Woolverton's Disney debut demonstrates great emotion and sincerity for what would be recurring features in hits such as the Aladdin, The Lion King and Mulan. The voice-work is never once out of place and lends itself to the grand illusion. The film will captivate audiences of any age and displays Disney's mastery for creating a story that revels in its beauty, simplicity and magic.",9,2,2,14 July 2015
Spider-Man 2," He's...just a kid.
","Spider-Man 2 is the greatest superhero film of all time. Entire cinematic universes have come and gone since its release in 2004, but what are cosmic challenges to the daily dilemmas of a kid who is the city's heroic web-slinger by night, and a mere pizza delivery boy by day? Its predecessor gave legitimacy to a new generation of big screen hero flicks. Spider-Man was hewn from obvious, in-your-face storytelling, the kind perfect for fans flocking from page to screen. The choices were as bold as any all-caps comic book title: save the woman you love, or a cable car full of screaming kids? Spider-Man 2 more or less resumes that moral quandary in the life of Peter Parker, who is heralded as New York City's protector, but can barely afford his one bedroom apartment's rent.The best stories about superheroes realise it is what is behind the mask that makes the man (or woman). That's why Mask of the Phantasm is a better Batman movie than The Dark Knight (despite the latter being the best Michael Mann picture not directed by the man himself). Bruce's most defining moment in the former comes not in beating down thugs and villains, but during a tearful soliloquy kneeling at his parent's gravestone, pleading for permission to remove his cowl and begin a normal life. Peter Parker makes the same plea here.Tobey Maguire finds the right note for this role, perfecting a look of astonishment that he returns to again and again. When he pays for a bouquet for Mary Jane, but realises he can afford only a trio, he accepts the fact with quiet resignation. And when he is refused entry into the play on account of lateness, he is speechless; he's just halted a high speed police chase, saving how many lives in the process? Working as a freelance photographer, his own scoops slander himself, but alas, the bills must be paid. Another of his assignments is to capture the moment another man proposes to the woman he loves. The story bashes and bashes him into submission until he is at his lowest point, undoing the mythos of the red and blue mask. Why put it on, when no one will give him the recognition or time of the day? Maguire allows us to understand his selfishness, about why he chooses to walk away. Superpowers made the high school punching bag's dreams come true, but they could never replace a chance to live a full life.Doc-Ock must be mentioned as the film's mentor turned villain, given plenty of gravitas via the sunken eyes of Alfred Molina. The character is ostensibly a human mecha-octopus, and on paper it shouldn't work as live action. Its camp potential is never milked more than in his 'origin' scene, where the robotic tentacles arise from the hospital bed, reincarnating in their fully fleshed, HAL-9000-inspired forms. Raimi shoots this with utter glee; you can tell he's riffing off his Evil Dead work, from the urgent push-ins to the blood-curdling shrieks. These robotic limbs move with a life of their own, whispering words into the Doc's ears, seducing him with promises of glory. That he is eventually given the opportunity to right his wrongs, and takes it, sets the film's ethos apart. There's no muddied misanthropy here, no ambiguous swathe of grey; rather, figures are bestowed power and given the chance to do the right thing.Here lies the core philosophy of Spider-Man 2, that anyone could be struck by lightning or bitten by a radioactive spider, but that true heroism lies in the choice to take up the responsibility of the mantle. It is Peter that does this; Spider-Man is just an alter ego. Raimi reaffirms this belief by stretching him thin (quite literally) in the climax of the film, where he must stop a runaway train from crashing over an unfinished track. Close-ups stress the punishing physicality of being a superhero. The suit rips from the exertion of his efforts, and unmasked, his face is contorted in agony, teeth gritted, and eyes scrunched up. Would Superman ever be shot in this way? Even when the Man of Steel is straining, he looks a million bucks. But Peter Parker is the furthest he can be from self-conscious. All he asks is for the same human spirit and bravery in those he saves, and those he opposes.",9,1,6,7 June 2019
Brokeback Mountain," And now all we got is Brokeback Mountain.
","The two first set eyes on each other silently. It is six minutes, after their initially job briefing, before they finally exchange a few clipped pleasantries and go on their way. The dialogue in Brokeback Mountain is only ever used as a last resort, when gesturing and actions can take you no further. It is little more than half-grunts, words masked by their drawls and layers of masculinity that prevent them from saying how they feel. Lee is more than competent visually, so he knows other ways of expressing this. The first sex scene is in almost complete darkness as they fumble around and rip at each other's clothes - he expects the viewer to orientate via the sounds. And what are they? Not tender words, or even moans, but guttural, deep-bodied grunts. It is less a less scene and more a wrestling match, in the way they grapple and push and shove. And of course there is that tremendous shallow focus shot of a nude Ennis in the background and Jack in the foreground. It hovers for longer than necessary, holding and holding until we are all but pleading for him to turn and look. There is repression that trembles in the frame itself, and his resolve is steadfast, at least for the moment. There is a great secondary cast surrounding them that also push and pull. Lee knows their importance. In a lesser film the forbidden love would be framed as some fervid romantic fantasy. The wives would be bitchy and the kids a nightmare, and they would yearn so much more for their escape into paradise. But this understands that Alma is a character too, and that she suffers in her own way. She is as similarly unequipped as her husband to deal with such things, and so briefly she is also in that state of continuous pain. Lee shows the same situation with Lureen, and through the edit allows for clever contrast. The last thing Jack does before leaving for his 'fishing trip' is to kiss her on the lips, and Alma (and the audience) expects the same from her husband. But Ennis is simply reaching for his bag, and the moment is like a gut-punch for both us and Williams. Ah, but she has learned the same ways of internalisation, and silently voices her pain. The same vicious comparison is seen during Thanksgiving - as one man is being displaced as the man of the house, the other makes his stand. Their respective tone and body language (Ledger is all but slumped and defeated) speak volumes of how they approach the sensitive issue of the visibility of their sexuality. The film covers a period of twenty years, and Lee never feels the need for any hefty title cards, but illustrates the passing of time in smaller details. Ennis flips Alma over to mimic Jack, and the groaning bed-springs give way to the match cut to the breaking rodeo gate miles away. The delicate twangs of the guitar submit to trip after trip, with inhibitions slowly papering themselves over and then cracking passionately, and sometimes, violently. A shabby cloth propped up by sticks eventually becomes something more of a shelter, but meanwhile Ennis' home and life slowly closes in on him. Who was it that Alma Junior was dating again? Brokeback Mountain is all about how Ennis is uncomfortable in his own skin because of a sight thrust into his eyes by his father at a young age, and how this tears him up inside. But in the process it is also about destroying the discomfort of the screen. They start as prototypical western males, thumbs tucked into belt loops, their skin coarse, their mouths sewn shut. The awareness not only exists on our level (both Gyllenhall and Ledger were young but established) but within their world, and each muscle of their body is fighting that pre-programmed urge that constantly reinforces itself through the culture and the people. This culminates in the most powerful scene of the film, when Ennis returns to Jack's parents and offers to scatter his ashes atop Brokeback Mountain. Every person in the room knows what he is here for, and what his former relationship to Jack was. John Twist speaks carefully. He twists the knife, goading Ennis through how cruelly he refers to his deceased son, and how he cannot show any emotion or mourn like they are allowed to. And Ledger cannot show that it hurts him, although we can see the pain etched in his face. Lee has made gay films in the past, but this most reminds me of Wong Kar- Wai's Happy Together, about another gay couple that were trapped in the ever-vicious cycle of love and hate. But that was more intimate, lusher in both setting and tone. Ennis Del Mar does not have the same luxury.",9,2,3,7 September 2016
About Time," You did, Dad. It was implied.
","There is a feeling one gets when watching a Richard Curtis film. The warmth starts from your middle, and then spreads out gradually to the tips of your fingers and toes. These stories are cinematic chicken soup for soul. It's that involuntary 'aah' that escapes whilst clutching a hot mug, as Wesley Morris puts it. Fine class dining it is not; merely a few ingredients tossed into a bubbling broth, but what could be better on a chilly Friday night? Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill made us believe we could slide right into the gang, or that we were laughing along right there at the Thacker dinner table, another etching into their modest, working class tapestry. His directorial debut Love Actually doubled down on this ensemble approach, beating audiences into submission with schmaltzy sentimentalism. And isn't that what Christmas movies are for? If you're going to commit, you might as well go all in. Roll that montage.About Time isn't about any ordinary British family, but it's endearing enough that it almost could be. The Lakes live by seaside in Cornwall, an idyllic childhood peppered with tea parties on the beach and projected films in the garden by moonlight and rain, their umbrellas unfurled in a Wes Anderson-esque tableau. The well-meaning Uncle Desmond is the film's sounding board for the level of affection that connects them, a life-sized teddy bear who offers warm words when you squeeze his palm. (Kit Kat is the only misstep here; she's everything you'd ever want in a sister, but she's not real, every pixie skip and tackle-hug straining the realms of authenticity). And the wonderful Bill Nighy is the heart of it all, able to distill philosophical tenets that might sound heavy or on-the-nose when spoken by others into bite-sized wisdom that can be offered over a game of ping pong. He's so grounded in his presence that he never lets the film get lost in its twee.Is that too strong of a word? About Time is not shy about its quaintness, but leans into it gently and invites the audience to pull up a chair. The Lakes are well off, but the phrase 'rich' would never drift into your mind during your viewing. The wedding could have been an extravagant affair, yet Curtis introduces a torrent of rain to wash away any pretense or fanciful notions, and in the end the speeches take place in a cramped little tea room with the guests crouching or standing or squashed next to each other on sofas or folding chairs, all a bit damp. It would be hard to see Americans be this self-deprecatory, or not play it for laughs. And there's never ever a thought of jumping back in time for a redo.This is low key sci-fi at its best, the time travel element almost accepted as simply magical realism. That this mechanic is never quite properly explained may irk some more hardcore fans, but I think it's beside the point. I've spoken before about Curtis' little touches but they are worth a mention here, a style so light and soft that you feel welcome immediately. His cinematography is cozy personified, shallow focus and warm, diffused light tracking the pair through the streets of London as if they were the only two people alive in the city that night, the universe still as they fall for each other. This is the meet cute at its optimal cuteness, with the preceding dialogue on their (literal) blind date a textbook on how to write dialogue for said meet cute, hitting all the right areas: some humour to lighten things up, a smattering of self-deprecation, and just the right amount of chemistry. See how Mary emerges from the restaurant and reveals herself to Tim for the first time, stumbling slightly on the step, backlit as if a halo hovers over her head, and a hint of smile framed by a fringe. I bought it at once. No amount of time travel could make Charlotte love him, but for Mary it was just a matter of time.",8,1,1,18 August 2019
About Time," I'll go out with Matt Damon.
","You're either a fan of Richard Curtis, or you're not. There's not much space in between. Long time admirers have readily come to terms with the fact that his stories will never venture outside that safe, spotless and sanitised version of England, which is often coupled with the aggressively quaint middle class of Hugh Grant. Yet his films are not always as modest as they are on the surface, particularly when they claim to represent the entire country's longing near Christmas time. Now that I think about it, it's often the effortless, windswept debonair of Grant that prevents these films from being too scrutinised. Would we question that chiselled jaw the same way we question the gangly, awkward ginger of Gleeson? Tim finds an early and sweet connection with Mary on a blind (literally) double date at a restaurant, and feels as if he is entitled to that same connection after his time travelling erases it. Perhaps he is, but is it then morally right to pretend to be someone he is not? To act vastly more interested in her interests than he really is, to redo their first time in bed until they are lights out, to mouth off at the potential boyfriend that he beats to the chase (a mean-spirited, out of character comment)? Mary herself doesn't seem to have a lot of say in this relationship, and when he pushes Tim for a third child, it feels less like an actual desire of her character and more the screenplay tapping Tim on the shoulder and telling him that his time is up. In Lindsay Duncan's interrogations, her imperfections are cutesy labels that don't appear anywhere else, while he's erased all of his. It feels dishonest. In response to these dilemmas Curtis might respond by showing the first example of Tim's experimentation with time travel, a simple and elegant demonstration of the power's limitations after a summer of attempting to woo Charlotte. That reasoning suggests that no matter how many different approaches Tim fashions she is bound to gently reject him, and so vice versa the same must apply to Mary: the initial spark is there, so their romance is merely a matter of time. This notion might have more weight to it if Curtis wasn't playing fast and loose with the logic of his brand of time travel. The power is lightly sprung onto a young Tim from his father with the nonchalance of buying a teenager a new car, and he only pops up periodically to shed new light on rules and regulations. The story is sweeter and more honest when the characters are the ones making the choices themselves; her slipping a little white lie into their conversation and getting him to walk her all the way home, and after the most casually adorable proposal ever, he doesn't rush to the nearest cupboard, but merely shushes the planned band away. Their wedding's weather must be a black omen from the heavens themselves, but she wouldn't even dare consider the idea of a redo. Curtis' flair behind the camera shines best when he injects splashes of formal elements into the honeymoon period of two young lovers - how Mary first emerges from the restaurant curtains with a little halo over her head, how the camera shakes with giddiness during Tim's walk home, in the way the world seems to come alive at their feet, and in how subway buskers seem to be personally serenading their blossoming romance. When he's not leaning on voice-over the soundtrack does an adequate job, churning whenever Tim's anxiety beckons him to the cupboard, and softly accompanying the pair on piano in the gentler moments. He also utilises the montage to great comedic effect, one prominent example cycling through the various disasters of best man speeches and cutting abruptly to signal Tim's exasperation. But for all the rain-soaked sentimentality About Time moves towards a rather different end goal than the posters and Curtis' film history might suggest. The awkward Tim has solved the problem of his fanciful love life, but what happens when he tries to wield his powers to save others in his family? Kit Kat, who bounds in and out of scenes like an overexcited puppy, crashes and burns because she does not have the power, or so Tim thinks. Contrivances that force him to let things play out aside, he learns that sometimes fate is better off left alone, and that sometimes you need to let those you love learn their own lessons. Gleeson sells the role we all envision ourselves in by trying desperately to reach out and shield everyone, and in doing so discovering the cursed side of his blessing. It's a long way just to say 'carpe diem', but the message is well intentioned. Near the end there are a series of shots of a sleepy Mary nestling her head back into her pillow, and they are cut in a way that suggests Tim is replaying the day over and over, when in fact it is merely his mind magnifying and basking in the moment. He hasn't lost his power of time travel, but he's gained a new one in the appreciation of mortality and the preciousness of life.",8,1,2,17 January 2017
My Neighbor Totoro," Simply enchanting
","The original Japanese audio is imperative to My Neighbour Totoro and I highly recommended it. Not that the English dub isn't sufficient (Ghibli films tend to attract a certain amount of care), but it doesn't do justice the lovely representation of childhood and innocence that the master Miyazaki conjures here. The sisters Satsuki and Mei discover these dust bunnies, little black fluffballs with tiny legs and eyes (this design later revisited in Spirited Away), and they may exist or not, but the adults in their father and Granny certainly indulge them. They delight in this discovery of their 'haunted' house and scream out shrilly and cackle for the bunnies in a way that only the original Japanese can fully justify. And in the animation their eyes grow wide and their grins grow massive - even more massive than say, the arguing men in Castle in the Sky, and that is truly a mark of great emotion when considering Miyazaki's work. That is again revisited in the bathing scene amidst a harrowing storm, where the father ushers in this silliness and over the top laughter to scare away the evil spirits. He's a thoughtful and caring and accommodating character like so few fathers in fiction are today - he isn't the problem, but his career and absence merely a symptom of life. Hisaishi's lovely track 'Obake Yashiki' (or Haunted House) aids this discovery process; the eager plucks of the synthesizer create such a nervous excitement and curiosity that Satsuki and Mei clutch with their hands and eagerly embrace. I am reminded of this same track being used in this Chinese cartoon from my childhood, about a similarly gigantic tree amongst small trees in peaceful serene forest, until loggers arrive. But within those moments of pure delight in their childhood there is a significant blemish, their mother's illness which continually keeps her in hospital. The film does not focus on her plight as some sort of impending doom, but rather its implications and effects on the rest of the family. It is simply a fact of life. And so Satsuki has been forced into a role older than her years, a motherly comfort for Mei when she sulks and cries. She is, because of the unfortunate circumstances, pushed into the brink of adulthood. So it is the singular Mei who discovers the Totoro creatures, in a very delightful sequence where the white bunny-like one nervously rushes ahead and out of her eager palms. When she indignantly claims that she is not lying about her encounter (after the hilarious incident with the bushes), the adults nod in agreement after initially laughing at her. But Satsuki is also swept up in these tales, because even for her remarkably maturity, she collapses from things asked of her that are beyond what a little girl should be forced to face. And so we have two girls who are devoid of parental attention, and in this they find comfort and serenity in Totoro's adventures, playfully imitating Hisaishi's title theme with recorders atop the gigantic mystical tree.My favourite segment has to be the middle part where the two sisters go to the bus-stop with an umbrella for their father. Miyazaki lets us experience the rain and cold and impatience they feel, but it isn't sinister for no good reason. The giant Totoro joins them, and without a second thought Satsuki offers her the black umbrella, leading to the iconic and strange composition of the pair waiting in the rain for a bus, each with their own way of brandishing the umbrella. And sound design is used so weirdly and wonderful to establish Totoro as a gentle and mysterious giant; the heavy drop of rain that splatters against the umbrella, coupled with the adorable animation of the hairs standing up to attention and the wide lopsided grin. That grin is later copied by perhaps the strangest creature of them all, the cat-bus, with its multiple rapid legs and its pair of rats illuminating its destination. When its door magically widens, we hear a peculiar metallic sound effect, the only ones apart from the sisters to witness this. The magical friendship here is strengthened, though we are still somewhat baffled and amazed. My Neighbour Totoro is an extremely poignant and magical and strange exploration of the sort of childhood curiosity and imagination that children, but in particularly these two, can conjure. They play their recorders atop the giant tree, but it vanishes in the morning. Do they weep and moan? No, they rejoice and dance, imitating the same movements from last night to urge the little seedlings to burst forth once again. It's not the sort of tale that is ramped up to the extremities to promote some internal change - we get an inkling that is already happening with Satsuki, but it's not something that she is entirely ready to handle. And that's okay. Are these forest spirits a coping mechanism, or a fantastic comfort in a world that's a little scarier each time the sisters are told that their mother will not return home quite yet? Many films would have the children approach from a distance, cautious and apprehensive. The father, upon hearing of such a creature, would cynically berate such lies and establish himself as a sort of antagonist, but more importantly as an adult. Miyazaki makes the children squeal in delight and chase after such creatures. The father beats his chest in the most absurd way and cackles madly with his daughters. And later a weeping Satsuki collapses into the chest of Totoro, clearly overwhelmed by the burdens thrust upon her. She finds comfort and assistance. Everything will be okay.",10,0,1,22 September 2015
Match Point," Do you feel guilty?
","Match Point recalls Crimes and Misdemeanors, which also had a passionate affair threaten to rip apart the marriage of a wealthy high-class couple. But in the latter there was never an excruciating task to pull off, a immaculate getaway and attempt to cover his tracks. Judah convinces himself that the hit is his brother's idea, has someone else do the dirty work for him, and is never once threatened with the possibility of getting caught. It was his own moral conscience that created the tension. In Match Point, there are numerous ideals thrown around about luck and fate and determinism that really take away from its moral centre - and in the tense, quiet manner in which Chris commits his crime, and waits agonising for the neighbour to walk away, it becomes a detective thriller rather than posing meaningful questions. Chris is a retired tennis pro, which conveniently allows Allen to begin with a simple metaphor about his life's philosophy. He is from a poor background, but does not speak like it, and seems to have said goodbye to that world all together and never leave the world of luxury and riches when he becomes acquainted with the Hewett family. Early on, he seems rather embarrassed to receive a helping hand from Alec, but as time goes by, he gets more accustomed to a certain standard of living and would even kill for it. The supporting characters are rife with cliché. Bride to be Chloe does not have an ounce of responsibility and shamelessly encourages the buying of her future spouse, all while spouting nonsense such as 'I don't believe in luck, but hard work' without a hint of irony. Johansson's Nola is the wildly beautiful mess of a struggling actress with a deeper cleavage than back-story, and the Hewetts are of course disdainful of anyone that would seek to sabotage their legacy. Allen, on the financial incentive of BBC Films, shoots them on the backdrop of London's high class elite, but it feels more like a tourism advert with the annoying habit of them announcing every iconic destination they visit. This marks a distinct departure from Allen's usual style and not in an overly impressive way. He has never been so openly critical of the high- class intellectual but paradoxically make it so enticing and seductive for the lowly Chris. These are shallow, shallow people who breed ever so carefully to maintain their legacy (there's even a quick quip about interbreeding like some royal family). In Allen's best films such as Hannah and Her Sisters and Annie Hall, his blocking was clever and inspired; it allowed the actors to breathe and display their insecurities through their body language in simple long takes. Here, he has a tendency to shoot closeups and move the camera indiscreetly to imitate a furtive glance or sign of attraction rather than trust his actors to do it - or even frame a single subject just to highlight how obvious their actions are. Chris and Nola will be shown in bed together several times, but cut away from before they reach peak physical passion - it's certainly not the post-coital chit chat that they sneak away for. And its easy to mistake Rhys Meyers broody, edgy performance for something of great depth and conflict; he does well for what he is given, but there's no substance to the characterisation that makes the drive for murder believable. The two shots from the sawn-off are over in a second, and he is allowed no time to linger and react.Luck is purported to be the universal element. Allen is not subtle about this; it is brought up in conversations it has no right to be in, and in moments of dramatic climax, the soundtrack fades to make way for an opera backing, and a tiny incident of chance gets slowed down for faux poignancy. The script contains these little clues and red herrings that would not be out of place in a cheap thriller; an acquaintance near Nora when she gets that fateful call, an painfully long interrogation of Chris at the dinner table that is awkwardly thrown in for tension, and when Nora gets pregnant right away after months of toiling with Chloe, he winks at the audience and says: 'What unbelievably bad luck!' And there are these cops which provide a very convenient ending. First they are hesitant to poke into family affairs. What sort of murder investigation would ever consider this? And then, almost insultingly, he comes to the perfect solution in a dream. Allen's writing might at times be snobbish, high-brow or overly pretentious, but it's never been this lazy. In the end, Chris is lucky that these detectives are written so poorly.",6,0,1,9 February 2016
Children of Heaven," Bacheha-Ye aseman
","The film's poster has a bright, dream-like quality, as though it has been etched from a child's imagination itself. But the stories within are not daydreams, but real issues that a young brother and sister have to face at a much too early age. When Ali takes his sister's shoes to be mended, they are mistaken for trash (which tells you as much about their condition of living) and taken away. This would be a hard sell in a western setting; it seems inconceivable that such a mundane loss could propel a family into such desperation. We take the very material that protects our feet from the ground for granted. For Ali's family there is no such fortune. When he returns home crestfallen, he can barely believe what he has allowed to happen and cannot face breaking the news to his sister. Zahra's anticipation is along the liens of the poster; her eyes are wide, bright, and innocent, and she has the type of face that is impossible to disappoint. He breaks it to her slowly, gently. They silently pass notes between each other because the father would beat them if he found out. But I think there is also another reason for this. We underestimate the feelings of children so often. They do so in secret because they have enough sensitivity and awareness that they do not want to heap yet another problem onto the pile for their parents. The film is full of moments which give them the opportunity to open up about their poverty and domestic issues. But they carry with them a fierce pride that prevents them from doing so. There is a very real and realised scene where their father explodes because of all their misfortune and the lack of control around it. Ali and Zahra see this and respond; they want to minimise, and they want to resolve this issue themselves. And later, there is the heartbreaking moment where they track down the user of Zahra's old shoes, but see the recipient's misfortune for themselves, and slowly shuffle away with this realisation. This is maturity beyond their years.There are a few brief moments in which they are allowed the freedom to act their age. As the father toils hard in the garden, Ali is allowed to play with the similar aged son, and we are reminded of what a child should be doing. Their laughter is little more than gurgles, like a newborn baby. And when Zahra and he are afforded a moment to blow bubbles, the soundtrack, which has been strictly diegetic for almost the entirety of the film, chimes in with this soft, tinkling tune. It is an alien sequence, seemingly from another film with another subject matter. But it works because the audience and both Ali and Zahra are aware of the juxtaposition, and know how precious and fleeting the scene is. Majidi crafts the film in the tradition of the great Italian neo-realist films, which prioritised authenticity and realism above all, and examined the plight of the working class. The camera observes like a fly on the wall, never quite staying still, with no audacious movements for aesthetics' sake. The soundtrack places us within the scene, and allows us to hear what the characters hear, the bustle of many families with their own struggles. Majidi makes what could be seen as contrived (bicycle brakes failing at a crucial moment) into something heart-stopping and fearful. We have invested so much into Ali's family that we understand that such a fall could ruin them beyond repair. And yet Majidi does break this stylistic convention at the most pivotal of times. Besides neatly sidestepping the previous obstacle (the father is shown to be healthy and walking soon after), the narrative conveniently forgets about the substantial payment of the gardening job if only to heighten the tension of the cross country race. Majidi inserts garish and heavy-handed reminders of Ali's struggle as he huffs and puffs, as if he does not trust the audience enough to remember. The sound is muted and voice-over recalls what he is running for, and each step is magnified in the slow motion. These techniques belong in a lesser film. But there is a poetic sentiment about it; Ali wants to right his own wrongs, and Hashemian expresses every last spasm of regret in those eyes. The film gently assuages...that for today at least, he does not have to do it all himself.",8,0,0,17 July 2016
Midnight in Paris," Golden Age Thinking
","The interesting thing about Midnight in Paris is that it sets you up into thinking this is another Alvy Singer - in Gil's first lines are those disparaging Hollywood hacks like himself and wishing to write something real, something substantive that can be counted amongst the literary canon. You know, the Hemingways, the Fitzgeralds, the Steins. Then it sort of switches it around a little, and Gil becomes the hopeless romantic who is forever entranced by the rainy streets of Paris and Inez is the one who disparages him for this. And then finally Allen settles on a happy medium, where both possess different types of pretentiousness. The city of love is established well, with the same loving treatment as the beginning of Allen's Manhattan. Before we are introduced to our couple, we are treated to a few minutes of a travelogue of sorts, postcard shots of the bridges, the streets, the park fountains, and of course the Eiffel Tower. Khondji bathes the entirety of these exterior shots in a warm golden glow, and we become aware of just how gorgeous it is. Later as Gil slips into the past, it becomes even more yellowy, the period sets becomes warm and homely, and the music fits - romantic saxophone, then the tender voice of Gale Porter. When Gil tries to hurry back to the party, he stumbles upon a sterile laundromat instead, lit harshly in blue green. The dream is over for tonight. When the group visit Monet's Water Lilies, Allen shoots them distantly, removed from its beauty in the sterile white oval room, and when we get a close-up, the painting is quickly obscured by the bickering of Inez and Gil, trying to get a word in. Some might call Allen's Paris too idealistic; you would be hard pressed to find a shot not in shallow focus, blurring the city lights, and the backdrop crisply clean. Well, the answer to that is, Gil sees what he wants to see.From the first moment we are clear that this engaged couple is not meant to be. They exist on too entirely different world - Alvy Singer is not Gil, but in fact Paul, who is described as a pseudo-intellectual and pedantic. He is a professor of something, which allows him to be the expert on many things and drive a wedge between this engagement. Adams is fantastic; she certainly is sexy as designated by Gil, but there are little moments which make you wonder how she can be so sexy yet so infuriating. Gil is caught red-handed trying to pawn off her pearl earrings for some back-in-time sex, and here we have a scene in every romantic comedy, and it is so easy for Inez to get suspicious. But instead she vainly gestures at herself when seeing the present: 'For moi?' Her parents are considerably more insufferable - right wing, high class and jealous parents stereotypes who dismiss chairs that are less than twenty grand, who set upon private detectives on soon-to-be son-in-laws, and from whom no doubt Inez learned her disdain for the help. That is one little line that speaks volumes of this relationship; another is the hilarious moment where Gil tries to justify it to Andriana, and mumbles out a compromise about 'some types of Indian food'. The dreamy time travel sequences are not contemplative to their fullest extent. It's never easy to portray figures who have already been immortalised. Allen does it lightly and winks here and then; Hemingway drunkingly tries to spark a boxing match and talks pointedly of hunting and manhood, Zelda Fitzgerald is ditzy and given little time to really justify committing suicide, and that delightful scene where Gil offers up the idea of The Exterminating Angel, and Luis Buñuel is left bewildered at his own work of art. Gil explains his situation to a group of surrealists, and they seem fine with it. Another hilarious moment is when Kurt admits to having Gil tailed, and then we cut inexplicably to the poor man stuck and terrified in 18th century Versailles, and perhaps these events were real after all. The important thing is that Gil realises these legends aren't so much different than us all.Of course, the detractors point at the twee and the remarkably idealistic romance of it all. Allen has Gil realise that nostalgia is denial, yet paradoxically places him within a very very beautiful modern Paris. In Gil's aspirational journey he uncovers another paradox; the endless cycle of nostalgia, and is shocked to discover that Andriana prefers the Belle Époque era to this wonderful period. So he departs for the inescapable present. Another director might have made Léa Seydoux's sweet character some sort of descendant of the Picasso mistress, because isn't that magical? But they make their own magic in the rainy streets of Paris. Up above, Van Gogh's starry night swirls. Everyone yearns for this sort of ending.",8,0,0,5 November 2015
Zodiac," I am not the Zodiac.
","The basement scene is the most talked about of the entire film, and rightfully. At first viewing I was entranced, and yet a little disappointed when it eventuated for nothing, because then it feels like a cheap way to drum up tension for the sake of it. But as I revisited it it made more sense - the overarching theme of Zodiac is not about the killer so much as it is about Graysmith losing his mind over the case, and here he is creating his own red herring out of his paranoia and fears. Which creates a few other problems. It is a fine scene of course; like the lake stabbings, there is zero non-diegetic sound so the tension is carried predominately by Gyllenhaal's heavy breathing and the sinister whistle of the kettle upstairs, suggesting an accomplice. Upon re-watching it is almost too cinematic to be true compared to the rest of the film; when the supposed Zodiac pulls the string to drown out the only light-bulb and usher in complete darkness, it veers into something a script would stress and a movie be built around. But it works. The problem is that is creates an entirely new subplot where Graysmith's mind goes and this is not entirely justified. We have to be told that his marriage is collapsing, that the shallow relationship with Sevigny is at it's breaking point. Gyllenhaal's performance is very straight forward.This is an entirely minor issue because Zodiac is by all means fantastic. Fincher heavily leans on the reality of the Zodiac case, consulting at length with real life victims, police files and other sources in order to capture exactly how it happened. This isn't seductive or decadent or grimy like Se7en; there are no crisp shallow focus guns pointing right at us within a rainy back alley. There is no high speed chase through the crumbling buildings. The soundtrack is period accurate and ushers in the passing of time, yet the most potent moments are without that backing track. The aforementioned basement scene, and of course the stabbings at the lake. Fincher shot on the exact same day and made sure of every detail in his replica, although the grass and trees are withered yellow (like so many of the other scenes that are applied a tint) as the masked man slithers into view, and death and decay races through my mind. There is nothing to mask the brutal sounds of knife entering skin again and again. A story about Mila Pfefferberg, a Holocaust survivor shivering at the sigh of Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth comes to mind. I am sure that Bryan Hartnell feels the same way when he watches this scene. It is predominately shot on digital, but looks every bit from the late 60s. As a man in a yellow-cab taxi is killed, a guitar riff strikes in as the Zodiac killer stalks away. There is a great series of scenes, cross-cut, where numerous police departments attempt to find headway on the case but run into several technical difficulties and barriers that would be unheard of today. We are immersed from the get-go. A camera is placed atop a letter trolley, and we visit every room in the aged yellow newspaper offices accompanied by a Santana psychedelic instrumental made famous at the 1969 Woodstock. Marvin Gaye's soulful Inner City Blues serenades a period of years as the Transamerica is constructed. Montages are plentiful; flurries of inserts as Graysmith photographs the puzzle for his own memento, extreme close-ups that rapidly scan case files that are then chucked into an irrelevant pile, superimposed newspaper titles and TV broadcasts indicating that time has passed, but the Zodiac is still at large, and Graysmith's frustration grows. A cartoonist makes it his lifelong purpose, while Avery (playing impeccably by Downey Jr.) sees the scoop in it, drumming up publicity and questioning the killer's sexuality. A third investigator, Ruffalo's Toschi, is also consumed, although even he does not pursue it as diligently as our main character.Fincher goes a step further by focusing on one suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen. He breaks his supposed objectiveness in his shooting in one interrogation scene as three detectives visit Allen at work. We observe impartially at first, as they go through the usual pleasantries and questions, until Allen makes the mistake of crossing his legs, and we get a low angle shot that distinctly highlights the size of the boots and the detective's brief glance of this. At the mention of bloody knives (oh so perfectly casual from Lynch), the shot-reverse-shot becomes scarily intimate, and from Allen's POV the detectives are suddenly intrigued, staring right down his eyes, and when we cut, they are not looking at Allen, but at a close-up of the Zodiac watch he absent-mindedly thumbs. And in the penultimate scene, a tense climatic confrontation that in another film would be an action chase sequence, Allen stares down Graysmith, knowing what he knows, but also taking comfort in the fact that he cannot do anything about it. This film is more about a cartoonist's obsession with a serial killer than the serial killer himself, but it is nevertheless exciting. There is occasional indulgence from Fincher (think the bird's eye tracking of the taxi) but all in all it is not so hard to be lured in much like Graysmith becomes lured by the Zodiac killer.",9,2,2,10 November 2015
Once," Miluju tebe
","He is, like in many indie feature before him, a struggling musician with enough street smarts to know and play what the crowd wants to hear during the day, and then sing his heart out at night when no one listens and his voice is at its most sincere. His well-worn guitar has a great big hole in it, but that does not make the music any less from the heart - any musician whom has played and treasured an instrument through many periods of their lives will find this sigh familiar. And he is guarded too, so when he is asked a pointed question about past loves, he answers through half-mocking tunes because he knows he cannot commit emotionally to a fully sincere explanation. He hides behind the only thing he knows and can rely on. She too, has fallen into the same routine. She has her own emotional baggage, but it isn't quite as evident, because she doesn't just shoulder her own burdens, but also those of her non-English speaking mother and young daughter. She cannot afford the time to be busking her heart out, but puts aside an hour each day to quietly play at the local piano shop. But does all this mean they are destined together? Certainly Hollywood has told us before, and even the tagline misleading suggests this (no doubt a producers request - Glen Hansard did well to adamantly go against an eventual romantic ending). And the viewer too, has been conditioned to want this. When she replies to him with a cryptic declaration of love, there are no subtitles for the Czech language, because it is a way for her to say those words without actually committing to them. By the end of the film, they both know that although there is a feeling there, the time and circumstance is not right. If you look closely you see two people who are not emotionally healthy and stable to end up together. They want and are headed in different directions; he to further his music career, her to mend her family. With a shoestring budget, skeleton crew and amateur actors John Carney has delivered something rare and magical. The style takes a bit getting used to; certainly the way that passers by don't even acknowledge the hand-held cameras is disconcerting at first, and the lack of lighting setup is a altogether less glamorous look than we are used to. And yes, there are some cheesy moments. The first harmony comes together so perfectly that it does betray the story a little (and yes although harmonising is not as difficult as it looks it is what the scene suggests of the pairing). Then there is that moment at the bank where the small loans manager inexplicably reveals that he too had a musical calling, but has kept it hidden away inside. And then the predictable turn of opinion from Eamon as he scoffs over the phone at these 'oddballs', puts his feet up, and the then ragtag band proceed to play a near perfect rendition of the first track. Oh, but the best films are able to overlook these issues. When Hansard first hits that high note on the 'time' of Falling Slowly, I got chills on my arms, and that isn't something of a logical or rational reaction at all. I knew at once from experience that it would be the lead song of the movie and that more renditions would be coming, but then when it comes it hits like a train and wow, what a story these lyrics tell.",9,0,0,22 March 2016
Moana," See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me, And no one knows, how far it goes
","They're called 'I Want' songs, moments where characters survey the world around them and declare their dissatisfaction in the only way they can, through music and lyric. Quasimodo with the best view in the world but no way to touch it, shunned for his appearance. Rapunzel prancing around the tower, longing to see the world outside. Ariel with her museum of human utensils, transfixed by a handsome prince on two legs. And now Moana has given us one of the trope's best with the heart-soaring 'How Far I'll Go', which marries the lyrical genius of Lin-Manuel Miranda with a skipping, spirited Polynesian princess (she insists that she's heir to the chief, but as Maui points out whilst winking to the audience, 'If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, then you're a princess.'). Listening to the way in which the song transitions from its chorus to second verse with punchy, irregular beats makes it clear that this is isn't just shower business, it's a spoken plea to the ocean's call that tugs at her heart. The more cynical of the Disney veterans might be rolling their eyes at this point - these moments are just about obligatory for their animated features, and everyone loves to rally behind a character stuck in a rut, longing to seize their destiny with both hands. But the strength of Moana's 'I Want' moment isn't because it is an act of feminist rebellion ala Tangled or Brave, where the protagonists broke free of their cages, but a courageous bid to save the island and family that she treasures. The initiative lies with her, to go beyond the reef and seek a way to restore their home. Moana's opening reminds us of Hercules, beginning with epic myth and heroic battles shrouded in mystery, only to pull back humorously and wave away historical accuracy. A reaction shot of the captivated children tells us all we need to know the pick the main character - she's dead centre, with a pink flower in her hair and a big smile on her face. A following scene reiterates her calling, and doubles as a stunning tech demonstration at how far animators have come since Finding Nemo's watershed moment more than a decade ago. Moana, a bundle of toddler cuteness, waddles down to the beach, urging and protecting an equally tiny turtle hatchling, and then the water shifts out of her way like a loyal subject and wraps around like a living, breathing aquarium. What's especially impressive is how the underwater scenes shimmer under the sunlight and tremble along with the current, and how it reacts to Moana's curious touch, churning with bubbles and showering her with water droplets. The major studios have all but arrived at photorealism, and audiences will soon be spoiled for choice. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson looks and sounds the part of Maui, the demigod half-heartedly recruited on Moana's quest, and who sports the same broad, satisfied smiles. The voice acting musters all of the theatrical flair of his professional wrestling background - he flexes his action figure build with swagger, and in the endlessly catchy 'You're Welcome', manages to take credit for things he probably had no business creating (the tides, the sun and the sky to start, but there is so much strutting bravado and confidence crammed into the song that you're likely to cheer along like Moana does). The lofty figure is best when he is at his most theatrical, which is why I came to admire him not for his soft interior, but his selfless actions in the climax. He charges the lava demon Te Ka with little hope of victory, and has his weapon charred and broken beyond repair, but instead of cowering, he bellows at the behemoth before him, and launches into a fierce haka. This is the traditional war cry of the Maori, a proclamation of strength and resolve, and in the face of certain defeat, Maui is choosing to sacrifice himself so that Moana can make right his own wrongs. It doesn't get more heroic than that. Another endearing feature of Maui is his animated tattoo counterpart, which serves not only as comic relief but also as an extension of his conscience. The tattoo works in the most universal type of comedy, pantomime, and the way in which he constantly scolds, guides and keeps a running score on Maui's naughtiness is refreshingly original. Along the way the pair battle a sassy, egotistical crab who hoards treasures and puts a face to all the nagging, doubting voices in the back of both Maui and Moana's minds. Tamatoa seeks to crush dreams and sneer at their aspirations; he's moulded his identity around shiny superficiality, and dismissed everything but the skin deep. Only later do they buck his accusations and yes, find their true self that lies deep inside. Watching Moana reminded me of another movie which focused on the plight of a Pacific Island community and their heroine - Niki Caro's Whale Rider. While their approaches might be a little different, what is remarkable is their authenticity. We're long past the red-skinned Indians of Peter Pan, or the causal hand-waving of history in Pocahontas, and Moana shows it in strides. Her journey offers a chance to prove herself, and through it she reaffirms the pride and strength she holds in her Polynesian ancestry, trusting in it to guide her along the way. Witness the reprise of her 'I Want' song, which initially poses an identity crisis. Then her grandmother dies, but not before passing on their cultural legacy, in the form of a radiant stingray which provides that extra push to sail beyond the reef. And as she rides the wave, she proclaims loudly and proudly: And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me/It's like the tide; always falling and rising/I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me/That come what may/I know the way/I am Moana!﻿",9,5,10,7 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," You already have saved me.
","Return of the Jedi has the conclusion of the trilogy's Skywalker and Darth Vader's redemption at its core, which nevertheless does not save it from being the weakest of the trilogy. In many moments, it seems to echo its previous instalments, but with a lesser sense of wonder and escapism that Star Wars first wowed audiences with, and which Empire improved upon. There is another intergalactic band entertaining at Jabba's palace, but although the design and costuming of the aliens is creative and often unique, the derivative jazz song is not nearly as memorable as the Cantina Band theme. In Tattoine we had endless deserts, twin suns, houses submerged blow ground to avoid the heat, sand creatures and scavengers roaming the cliffs...here we have a impressive looking sail barge and an imposing creature in the dirt, but it does not feel entirely otherworldly, and the conflict and threat (specifically the iconic Boba Fett) are quickly extinguished, and it does not feel nearly as engaging as the Battle on Hoth. I point to a different little moment that expresses the world of Star Wars more effectively; as Jabba's rancor beast is killed, its handler emerges and sobs at this personal loss, and this is something which we can all identify with, and speaks volumes of the depth of Lucas' universe. The technical accomplishments remain, and are even crisper in the last of the trilogy. There are three particularly stunning matte painting backgrounds; Jabba's palace jutting out from the rocky cliff as one sun is already half submerged, the legions of stormtroopers saluting the Emperor's first live appearance as the Imperial theme blasts, and the last shots of the Ewok's treetop village huts where spots of light and celebration sing of the Empire's defeat. Jabba's costume is amongst the most impressive of them all; an immense animatronic puppet which took six people each controlling a different segment of the body and whom booms in a deep guttural Huttese. The various fighter jets, pod- racer and star destroyer miniatures are likewise lovingly crafted and detailed; some of these bluescreen backdrops create the most immersive and chaotic space battles yet in the series. The problem lies not in those areas but issues in the story. Star Wars, for the immense achievement that it was, was more an intro to the world and did not delve too deeply into the Darth Vader narrative, or the peril of the galaxy, and it was up to Empire to establish those strands. It perhaps left too much for RoTJ to lift; there are blocks of time in the film where characters will simply bring us back to speed and talk at length of the next plot development. Obi-Wan's ghost is conveniently informative (and the mention of the thematic relevance of point of view is not quite as bad as the infamous line in the prequels, but still slightly shallow), as is Yoda, who proclaims Luke battle-ready immediately after he returns to complete his training, and the reveal of the siblings is painfully drawn out, which perhaps exposes a small weakness of the dramatic acting of the main cast. Luke has a mission, and a climatic reunion with his father. The rest of the cast is pushed aside to Endor, the home of the Ewoks, whom twelve year olds loved because of their likeness to teddy bears, but everyone else despised because of their irrelevance and ability to so easily decimate high tech legions of stormtroopers. The cross-cutting of this battle with Lando's assault on the second Death Star only further emphasise the tonal issues with the entirety of the Endor subplot; not only does it seem ludicrous that the shield generators are located on a separate moon (so what happens when you need to leave this random planetary system), but the methods in which the Ewoks wipe out the stormtrooper battalions have become laughably cheesy in time and lacking compared to the tension of the real battle high above. The real strength of the movie is within Hamill's changed Skywalker, and in Sebastian Shaw's brief but crucial final moment. Post time- skip Luke is older, more mature, and understands the lure of the Dark Side which corrupted his father, so much so that he refuses to fight back even as the rebels are being defeated and throws his lightsaber away. As Vader witnesses his son be tortured by his master, the Kuleshov effect cuts back and forth between Luke's screams of agony and Vader's faceless mask, but the power of his characterisation enables us to know exactly how he is feeling, and in the final reveal of Shaw, redemption is attained. It is a pity that Lucas chose to mar this character (Anakin finds his redemption as the elderly Shaw, not as the moody Hayden Christensen - the force ghost should correspond with this) but the original trilogy stands the test of time. It is a galaxy that has become loved by millions.",8,0,0,26 November 2015
Begin Again," For my cat
","You know those YouTube comments on the Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd videos which moan and groan about the death of modern music and this generation's cultural milieu? Dan Mulligan is of the same opinion, and I despise him for it. I despise his jaded, cynical ass and old-fashioned perspective, his belief that the only good music that can be found these days are people yelling themselves hoarse (or in this case, delicately whispering lyrics) and strumming an acoustic guitar in a dimly lit bar god knows where. Ruffalo may be a decent actor, but here he basically lets his stubble and clothing carry the persona, shaking and stumbling drunkenly from scene to scene (and if he isn't convincing enough, the camera shakes for him). To kickstart the mid-film montage of vigour and determination all he actually needs to do is dress up a bit, and the dishevelled man from the opening all but disappears. In one rare moment of clarity, he unleashes on Gretta for not fully understanding his predicament and past, and it does enough to momentarily lift the character from cliché. It's a fair statement too, cautioning not only her but also the audience to not make initial snap judgements of the situation (he's portrayed pretty much as the typical deadbeat estranged father). The film's best moment circles back to the opening, now armed with this knowledge, and re-evaluates Gretta's performance through Dan's lens, the room coming alive with imagined instruments provided the backing track and accompaniment. But for that one tirade the rest of these characterisations are filled with gaps. Gretta proclaims that you can tell a lot about something from their playlist, but the film discards anything else that makes up a person. When you relegate every fibre of your being and emotion to song, you end up like Glee. Don't end up like Glee. You can't simply sing your way out of every life challenge. For all his rebellion and loathing of the modern music machine Dan also contradicts himself - minutes after they have met he is already trying to package Gretta up to sell with a 'killer music video and look'. In Begin Again, never has authenticity been so inauthentic. Carney's own Once was an indie masterpiece, made with pennies on the streets of Dublin. It had some cheesy moments, but also a strong emotional core led by two musicians who used their instruments and voices as buffers for the pain they went through day by day. This, in comparison, is full of A-listers, 'supermodels' by Carney's own admission, and celebrity cameos. A particularly funny and ironic moment comes when Gretta reminisces on the nostalgic, untouched past through her iPhone, back to a time when she was all lovey dovey with her boyfriend, pop superstar Adam Levine. Although Dave wears glasses and hoodies, he's fooling no one. As a boyfriend he's loving, loyal and true to his roots, until the pair arrive in the big apple and the city swallows him whole and spits out a cheating sell-out and jerk. Carney's image of the modern music label is an inflated caricature presented to serve his agenda; they not only produce music, but also specialise in corporate emotional meddling. The tag 'indie' is a diluted and meaningless term these days, but the film nevertheless strives for it through a vague definition of soul, authenticity and real emotion. Here's the problem with Keira Knightley's Gretta; she's presented to us immediately as some lost musical soul swallowed up by the city, but simultaneously a chirpy, confident force of nature with the uncanny ability to mend the lives of those she encounters. The film believes in the power of music so much that a song can even double as a way to confess infidelity, in one unintentionally hilarious scene where the mystical powers and acute sensitivity of Gretta exposes Dave's affair. Along the way she also teaches the classy ways of British dress to the trashy American teenager, and somehow glues together the cracks of divorce and estranged fatherhood. Watching this I am reminding of Little Miss Sunshine, which was so disparaging of superficiality and excess, but overcompensated with a sickly sweet dilution of empty twee. Knightley plays the hollow character with toothy grins and a pixie- ish vulnerability, yet it's impossible to defend the 'stadium-popificiation' of Lost Stars when it is ironically the same cliché-ridden pop tune as any of the targets the film takes aim at. How can you have so little self-awareness to package the film with an Adam Levine single? Who really wants to watch a film with a worldview like this anyway? Like Dan, it listens to a few tapes and chart-toppers and then hastily declares the death of music and artistry as we know it. It patronisingly sees a teenager's tank-top and shorts as a world- ending crisis and a sign of the moral degeneracy of today's youth. It posits that your musical talents are only legit if you are borderline homeless and resorting to busking on the street for coin. I've already scouted out Dan's next talented star - that little boy banging on the trash can with a stick is sorely even more authentic than acoustic Gretta. He's already a lot less pretty.",3,1,3,21 December 2016
Alien," Crew expendable.
","The opening of Alien recalls another sci-fi masterpiece, 2001 with its slow, labourious long takes that elegantly reveal its world (there's even a deleted Spaceballs-style shot where the gigantic Nostromo rolls over the top of the screen). Scott takes his time to introduce us to little bits of information as we need them - which is why the eventual reveal of Ash as an android is so effective. The assumed knowledge that with space travel comes advanced robotics has us second guessing every move even halfway through the movie. The camera-work is cautious in peering around each dim corner and ledge, as if it was a crew member in itself fearful for its own life. Modern horrors are always rushing to the next gory spectacle, the next money shot. Alien wants to milk every last drop of suspense of the universe's great unknown before it eats you up. The action subscribes to the notion of less is more. The dark shadows of the ship hide the alien from plain sight - an organic evil shifting in and out of tech that for all its advancements is a futile barrier (it becomes a dripping, primordial environment, perfect for fostering life). This is foreshadowed by the way the acid makes it way through several layers of the ship. The actors react to what they see - the shock of a sudden movement or a shocking clue is not overloading by the soundtrack like so many conventional horror movies do. We are shown what we need to see - a glimpse of a tail coiling out of thee darkness, a blip on the monitor gaining on a helpless member, static on the screen - and then the deepest parts of our imagination fill in the gaps. For the more explicit areas the effects are still excellent. One will never forget the first slow crane-up reveal of the gigantic alien pilot chair (I've always referred to this as the dentist chair) - a lifeless shell, but imposing nonetheless. There's a chilling sense of life within the alien baby, the way it abruptly breaches the boundaries of the spacesuit and coils around Kane's neck a little tighter when they try to remove it. A simple little premise renders their weapons useless - they are foolish to think they can capture it with a net and cattle prod, but it soon becomes a nightmare. The bursting of the chest - a bloody, visceral image that has become iconic because of the way it shocks and violates everything the crew thinks and knows of their safety and regulations. Ash's internal organs, a similarly grotesque sight, matched by his chilling mockery of humankind's chances - only a robot would be so gleeful and admirative of the perfect, remorseless organism gaining its survival by cutting down other living things (Asimov's rules come into play here). Much has been made of the clear phallic symbolism - the spitting second mouth like a jutting penis, the vaginal walls pulsating and dripping with life, the impregnation of Kane as a vessel. It does not fully reconcile the act of stripping at the end for me. Weaver was young and pretty enough to be considered a sex symbol and the skimpy display here reduces her to a basic horror archetype - the vulnerable, sexy girl, the last one to be picked off. But it is only a minor grievance - Ripley is established as being clearly the one with the most sense and brains, and the studio obviously had faith in her by keeping her alive for potential sequels. Decades on this is still a remarkable sci-fi horror achievement.",9,3,4,17 April 2016
Taxi Driver," The papers always blow these things up...
","Bernard Herrmann's score for Taxi Driver has two distinct, recurring elements to it which Rosenbaum call 'heaven' and 'hell'. The latter is that ominous, brooding brass heavy tune that pumps up again and again as the taxi glides through the darkness of New York City like Charon's ferry through the River Styx. It thuds and blares in time with Bickle's heartbeat and pursed-eyed glare as he surveys the filth and scum around him - the city's terrors come alive in the soundtrack, hisses of machinery and auto-mobile, gusts of steam erupting from the ground, water whipping up a blurry haze from inside the taxi's POV. And the former is that romantic jazz influenced saxophone fill that feels like it could be plucked from Woody Allen's Gershwin-inspired love letter to his favourite city, but here it is steeped in irony. In the final sounding of this motif, the camera hovers over the 'happy' ending for Travis - the tiny little newspapers clippings branding his heroism, the narration of Iris' parents' gratitude, lingering on Betsy's admiring glances at the now celebrated figure. These two elements clash again and again like they are fighting for control of the narrative; Travis' own paranoia and disintegration of his mind muddle it further.He is a Vietnam veteran and feels disillusioned by the state of the city he lives in. Haven't we all once felt the same sort of loathing for elements out of our control - a rubbish heap dumped in the middle of nowhere, homeless slumming in the streets, violence ringing in our ears. But we at least have the capacity to deflect, to avert our gaze and move on. Travis cannot turn away - he soaks and absorbs each incident he sees, and though he claims insomnia and a hatred for all the city's night goings that lead to him cleaning cum and blood off his back seat, he drives and drives and drives, like an addict who cannot stay away, and Scorsese magnifies each transgression in his eyes with a hazy slow-motion effect and uses Chemtone so each nightmarish spot of darkness on the streets leaks into open spaces. Schrader has written what others have described as a 'walking contradiction' - Bickle's addled mind makes frightening justifications in between his rather sane lapses. Ignoring the same disregard for the filthy prostitution business on the streets he regularly visits porno theatres - alone, you might add. In a city filled with millions of people he cannot make a connection. The identification of Betsy as a pure, white angel in a midst of black filth goes beyond sexual desire but as a metaphorical release from the setting - the romantic theme will then chime in, like a heavenly accompaniment lifting their connection beyond earthly pleasures (Herrman later uses these harp glissandos to indicate the same sort of ascension). But reality does not match this daydream of Bickle's. De Niro's performance excels not only because of his manic terror but in the quieter moments, his brief lapses of social understanding. The jokes hit a lull in the conversation, and disappear into awkward silence. The nervy, blank smile almost betrays his thoughts along with a tendency for his whole body to shiver with anticipation of his martyrdom. And in his feeble desperation at losing a rare connection, Scorsese pans away to an empty corridor because the state of Bickle is too embarrassing to behold. The genius of Scorsese and Schrader is the sympathy they evoke from such a dangerous, loathing and psychotic individual. There is a spirited montage of him getting into shape, honing his marksmanship, and that infamous scene in the mirror that has been homaged countless times. The loneliness leaks through the tough, jaded exterior. And there are opportunities too, for him to relinquish the saviour role he has branded himself with, but which no person like Travis Bickle would take. The softly-spoken advice from a fellow cabbie, or that suggestive glance from Betsy that serves as his end redemption (which is a deliberate nod to the insanity of the perception of his crime - imagine how she would react had his assassination been successful). But he has killed the right people, so to speak, and is heralded for it whilst not truly finding satisfaction. Each of Chapman's compositions serve his increasing, nagging desire to clean the streets - even in the beginning as he applies for his license, his gaze is focused on an argument in the back mirror. And in his frustration and refusal to comprehend that Iris might not want to be saved, it seems there is little time between his next purge.",10,0,2,2 April 2016
Lost in Translation," For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.
","Lost in Translation is a comfortable film. It's Antonioni-lite, it's existentialism 101, it poses these characters as tortured, angsty souls that can't seem to reconcile their desires of self-actualisation and the obligations of their privileged existence. It has become clear by now that Sofia Coppola has also found a comfort zone; she's visited this material before, of the upper-middle class citizen surrounded and disgusted by artificial excess and seeking solace beyond what is already granted to them by birth or status (Somewhere, and The Virgin Suicides). You can always make this work, but there is a very fine line between being genuine and being simply self-absorbed.The film sees gone to seed movie star Bob Harris and post-graduate/marriage Charlotte find their solace in each other, in Tokyo. Coppola relies heavily on alienation of the Japanese setting to whisk them away from their ennui; removed from the usual hustle- bustle of corporate America, they lose themselves in the night-life of the city and forget all their troubles. They are pretty and comfortable experiences; Acord shoots with energy and vitality, aligning his camera as a hazy participant itself, lost in the neon maze of Tokyo. Charlotte marvels at the many lights and gadgets of the arcade, as if she is relishing the childhood glee and freedom. Inhibitions are destroyed through booze and karaoke - a wild and once-in-a-lifetime adventure. But Coppola also brings in a rather bizarre side to the Japanese culture, which has led to accusations of racism. Offensive or not, the portrait she etches of contemporary Japan is a insulting elementary contrivance, which seems to serve the characters at every turn. Technological advances are demonised; the fax machines wakes him at four in the morning, the blinds automatically open against his will, the shower-head offers unwanted freedom, even the elliptical is against him. He is mocked at every turn. The commercial director spits a furious stream of instructions, which are simply translated for the bemused Bob. The missed opportunity for comedy (subtitles would have offered insight into the director's zeal, plus his eagerness and homage to Casablanca) creates another effect; instead of laughing at the idea of messages being lost in translation, we are merely laughing at the director and his gibberish. His passion turns into wackiness, which is then material for condescension. When Coppola tries intentional comedy, it fails spectacularly, dragging out the tired trope of the Japanese mixing up their l's and r's into ridiculousness. These are not Japanese characters, but silly stereotypes.The crux of the film is that the pair's situation has led them to this moment. Aside from Coppola's rather lazy imagining of the absent husband and potential infidelity (Anna Faris at her most annoying), their heartfelt connection is tenuous at best. Coppola never lifts it beyond your standard Hollywood fare; they have semi-meaningful conversations whilst lying in bed, they talk of the aimlessness of their lives at different stages, they comfort each other because they both have some vague dissatisfaction plaguing them (conveniently, neither have any other valuable friends or family to voice this to, and in their attempts to find it over the phone, there is always a task for them to run off to). But the real disappointment isn't in the predictability of the story. It's in how serious it takes itself, how their early or late life crisis, however vague, is elevated into some sort of heroic and torturous ordeal. Bob and Charlotte think themselves above all the other conforming Americans they left behind, but their story is not nearly as spectacular or special as they think it is. They merely have the luxury of being able to vacate to an exotic destination and escape for a while in their little bubble of angst. They sing just as badly as Kelly does, but are portrayed as wildly beautiful messes and bundles of insecurity. This difference in treatment reeks of navel-gazing self-importance.",5,4,6,30 July 2016
Doctor Strange," Stan Lee: That is hilarious!
","Doctor Stephen Strange is by my count now the third rich and arrogant jerk to be run through the Marvel blender and come out the other side a superhero. These stories of redemption are easy suckers because the heroes are merely sitting on the other side of our affections and all it takes is a little goodwill and roughly hewn smirk for audiences to be won over. Robert Downey Jr. played fast and close to his real life persona, and Chris Hemsworth more than looked the rugged part, but also spoke with natural confidence. For all the detractors of the MCU and the criticism it attracts for being formulaic, Doctor Strange knew it would hit a home run by simply retracing the paths of this formula. Anyone who's seen Sherlock already knows how condescending Benedict Cumberbatch can be - it was just a matter of shaping him towards looking out for the greater good. But real pitfalls don't really exist in Doctor Strange. The arc of the arrogant man brought to his knees by unfortunate circumstances and made to defrost and learn a little humility is a crowd pleaser, as the studio's track record has already shown. Yet Strange happens to casually master every spell-bending, kung-fu kicking lesson thrown at him, and by day two he is already sneaking into the library and speedreading all its ancient formulas (he has photographic memory, as you do). You can't simultaneously humble a protagonist but keep prodding him forward as the chosen one, destined to bring balance to the force or protect the Earth or something. Strange keeps reaching for his plotted redemption, attempting to swallow his ego and think about someone other than himself for once, but how can he do that when magical capes of levitation are throwing themselves at him and ancient immortal beings are passing on enormous burdens for his shoulders to carry? There is an abundance of excellent actors here - Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, the painfully under-utilised Michael Stuhlbarg - and barely a solid character between them. Wong is Wong, guardian of the library and a master of the mystic arts, but is quickly relegated to being the straight counterpoint to Strange's comedic quips. Marvel's humour is by now purely fan service, one-liners served on a platter directly to the audience, crafted via scientific method to elicit the most laughs. When someone mentions Beyonce, Drake or wifi passwords, they're addressing the audience through the screen, and the movie's characters treat these moments as required formalities. Yes, Wong silently humming Single Ladies is a nice touch, but why reduce his role in the climax to one reeking of bathos, as if he's become the giggling punchline to a long running joke? Between that and having his corpse being pulled from the rubble via time-reversal, he hasn't been given a single capable moment. Mikkelsen should feel the most maligned of the cast - the screenwriters have resurrected a D-level villain for the purposes of a single film, and him to become the unfortunate victim of Strange's origin story. Kaecilius sports edgy, alien guyliner and monologues morosely of his noble purposes for seeking power from the dark dimension (yep, that's what it's actually called), but the script doesn't bother to throw some flashbacks or even the name of a dead spouse to bolster his motivations. Eventually he's swept aside for the big gas cloud baddie in the finale. Strange's method of attack here is clever, but the scene descends into what is essentially a gag reel. The story builds up to the moment by stressing the need for Strange to finally act selflessly, but the endurance act isn't the eternity of torment that it needs to be. It's supposed to test his newfound resolve, but instead of gritting his teeth as the death beam incinerates him, he's rolling his eyes and mouthing 'not again' like a Looney Tunes character about to succumb to gravity. After all that, the movie pretends to warn us of the fatal dangers of playing with time but then uses it as a precursor to what will eventually happen - it's an exposition stepping stone, designed so that his mastery of time manipulation doesn't feel too strange. Doctor Strange bursts at the seams trying to squeeze in all its new rules, villains and mystical powers into yet another piece of the Infinity War puzzle. Marvel deserves praise for pulling off something magnificent and unheard of in bringing unwieldy comic material to life, and joining all the strands together. Yet looking closely these movies are only loosely cobbled together by whispers, cameos and the infamous post-credits scenes. One of the most inexplicable moments in Civil War comes when Spiderman and Ant-man suddenly pop out from behind the greenscreen to take their place on opposing sides of the skirmish. All the comic book fans cheered, but what about those of us in the audience that wanted some motivation?",5,1,2,3 March 2017
Barry Lyndon," The grim, invincible enemy
","Barry Lyndon is a visual and technical marvel if there ever was one. Kubrick's infamous desire for perfectionism down to the tiniest details meant shooting to mimic natural light in order to capture the pure essence of the late Baroque period. The iconic candlelight scenes had to be shot with a special lens with a tiny f-stop in order to capture as much of the light possible and cast a faded glow across the scene. But he also had to juggle this with the small depth of field that would contradict the flatness of the compositions which he had so meticulously designed. The use of the zoom out/ins over the dolly is crucial to this process; the zoom allowed Kubrick to preserve the scale in his sets (a zoom would be like blowing up a picture) where a dolly would have marred the perspective. Add to that the gorgeous mise en scène and production design, and the catatonic, still-life quality of the staging and you have the often point of praise that each frame becomes an 18th century painting in itself. So we see a tender close-up of grasped hands or a despondent mourning face, and then outwards, the bigger, colder picture. These characters seem trapped by the time period and their respective settings. In the first act we see Redmond and how he came to be Barry Lyndon - the impulsive, love-struck warrior that doesn't want to fight but will do it for his personal causes, whether it is to win a lady or save his own skin. And repeatedly as the zoom outs do, in an anti-picaresque way, we see how there are larger elements beyond his comprehension and control which push him towards that high estate, the pinnacle of his 'wealth'; the conspiracy to get him out of the picture of Dora's betrothal, a fellow soldier sneakily offering him choice insults, or the gambling prowess of Chevalier (a sort of play on the idea of luck itself, but it is never Redmond's hand that deals the card). And then in the second act O'Neal's expressionless, one-note performance finds its little niche, drowning his sorrows in drunken stupour, senseless violence and all the marks of a man gone to seed. He stumbles into wealth as easily as he wastefully leaves it, but even in his lowest moment Kubrick does not relent stylistically. The final, detached text seems to confirm this; a smothering and suffocation of the greed and degeneracy of the wealthy aristocratic noble class through stylistic narrative, forgotten in death even as the narrator paints a vivid picture. It is from this voice-over that the narrative dissonance is created and where Kubrick subverts. In one instance the narrator gives an old cliché; that war read from the comfort of an armchair is much removed from the reality and horror of experiencing it for yourself. And yet the battles in Barry Lyndon are staged beyond realism; the soldiers are arranged in geometrically straight formations in order to cater to Kubrick's zooms, and they march onwards and upwards even as comrades fall all around like they have been programmed to (a thematic counterpoint to Kubrick's envisioned Napoleon). Redmond is the only one to fall back and comfort a friend in his last breathing moments - in the first act he has still that tiny vestige of compassion and humanity. And he parts on decent romantic terms with a lonely German mother during the wartime...Barry Lyndon does not even offer those little condolences, but openly flaunts his infidelity. Furthering this theme we have a disconnection between the formal narrator and his flowery, historic prose fit for a history book and the way that Kubrick has actually depicted the events of the film. First we have the duels, which are so ridiculous and outlandish in the way they pause at each step for civility and ensure the correct chivalrous procedures have been followed. Their movements are rigid not flashy, and everyone knows when it is over - there is no surprise resurgence or twist. And here you can gleam a little humour too - see how cordial the robbery of Redmond is, and how they seem to cheerfully acknowledge the very meta-fictive script that these incidents seem to follow. In the one instance that Barry does take his own control he is wounded and literally rendered immobile. They are bound by what has already been said of them, or in the case of Redmond's first battle, written over and forgotten altogether. The narrator continually serves to remind us that these events have long been recorded and gathered dust.",10,5,8,5 April 2016
Full Metal Jacket," The Jungian thing
","Full Metal Jacket's thematic exploration on the duality of man is not buried in the slightest...in one moment Joker (aptly named) even jests about the origin of his 'born to kill' slogan on his helmet and his inevitability at getting his hands stained with blood with war coming. This is not really actual engagement but rather Kubrick being witty. Suffice to say that most wars could end up going down the 'war is hell' pathway where there are no clear moral boundaries and fresh-faced young men are thrust into a chaotic, nightmarish world to cope. In Full Metal Jacket Kubrick has done the same as what Stone did in Platoon; obscure the surroundings in smoke, ash and explosions, give no sense of direction or control, and drop the inexperienced squadron right into the middle of it. Here, they have no idea who or what is shooting at them half the time, and it is terrifying and disorientating, and the film begins to close in on them and their paranoia rather than have it be an external battle. The frenzy of war also reflects the stylistic shift that Kubrick has created here. First the rigid geometry of the boot camp, the long rows of bunk beds, the spotless surfaces, the coldly-lit corridors that allow for no non-conformity. And then the smoky, shaky battlefields where all sense of purpose and direction is lost. It is no wonder that so many viewers have found the first half of the film so riveting and yet cannot engage with the second half after the soldiers are dropped in hell. But is the raw and senseless portrayal of war really saying as much as it thinks it is? Many war films making the same bait and switch have long relied on the audience expectations, in particularly those who have never been so much as near a battlefield, of it being a precise and action-packed affair, especially with the less serious films paving the way for masculine, adrenaline-filled heroics and balls of fire. But the other extreme is also a bit nonsensical; there is only so much chaos and disorganisation and bodies flying that you can really throw at the screen until the message because senseless. It cannot at any point be an actual substitute for substance, an argument for the listlessness and meaningless experiences of these youths. Apocalypse Now was another film that went along the same lines, but found itself confused and with little to say at the end. But even that had a certain warping of the mind, of the physical and mental being muddled until we knew neither how long nor how far the crew had sailed up river. Here, the scenes are not part of a descent or a journey, but individually compartmentalised. If anything the vividness of the opening boot camp is an anti-climax. It promises the harshness and physicality and broken mentality of the battles to come, and then takes a little detour, if only to give that final extended sequence a little extra punch. Dishonesty is not something that Kubrick would normally be accused of. But here it is, flashy and in our face; Lee Ermey from a low-angle shot, seducing and making the audience clamour for more, and then overshadowing the rest of the film. Gomer Pyle's fate is perhaps a little less impactful than it might have been in 1987. Back then it was edgy and serious - today these menacing, open- mouthed snarls, the zoom-ins to the dead eyes, the loving whispers to the rifle and the adoration of Whitman and Oswald have all been seen before, so their shock lessens considerably. It is not all lost, simply because Vincent D'Onofrio is excellent. When smirks at his first confrontation with Hartman, and we really believe that he is trying to hide is smirk, but all the same we smirk with him. Kubrick has something to say about violence, and how it is not all that it is chalked up to be. But when Pyle takes a shot at his drill instructor and finally finds satisfaction, the bullet piercing his chest is in slow-motion, and over-dramatised. Later he constructs an elaborate set-piece involving two sets of camera crews, and makes a pointed note at the artificiality of the Vietnam battlefield, but has not realised he has contradicted himself. He has also walked right into a massive oversimplification - it seems the world of Vietnam is separated thinly by two archetypes of solider. One is the blatantly racist and juvenile meat-head like Animal Mother and co., as seen by the martial arts routine of the camera thief, the way they massacre civilians out of a helicopter like a video- game, and the approach towards the prostitute (a funny irony as they later get terrorised by a little girl wielding a machine gun). The other is the saint within a hellhole, Joker as the solitary moralist who does not want to wade into waters until he is too far gone. Kubrick wants to make his inevitable fall agonising, but even that isn't a irredeemable act, but rather a compromise - he is mercy killing the girl to prevent further pain. In one moment a soldier simply steps on a landmine and is blown up. There is no droning of the soundtrack, only silence, and the life is taken from us just like that. But Kubrick is more content to smother the film in the plastic ironies of upbeat pop songs over senseless violence. The squadron marches along soullessly to the tune of Mickey Mouse, but we already knew the tone their lives would take.",6,0,0,15 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," We are what we grow beyond.
","Having witnessed TROS a week ago and realising that it required a moment to process, I went about re-watching its predecessors. I had never really registered the prequels as anything more than schlocky fun, but putting myself into the shoes of ardent fans waiting with baited breath at the turn of the century, TPM becomes more than just a disappointment. The political discourse aims for complexity but its conflicts are resolved with laser swords, the dialogue's delivery gives a fresh meaning to the word monotone, the ethnic stereotypes are at best irritating, and the visual effects are downright ugly. While the podracing sequence has aged relatively well, it's symptomatic of another issue - whoever thought it was a good idea to devote an entire third of Vader's origin story to his dopey pre-teen self? No matter his midichlorian count, the plot itself is inconsequential; the galaxy lies in precarious balance between the light side and the dark, but here he is playing with action figures.Then there was AOTC, with its messy concoction of teenage angst and a side of detective mystery, in which George Lucas learnt to address his critics by throwing more lightsabers at the screen. ROTS is admittedly the best of a sour bunch, partly because it always had the benefit of Vader being the eventual end of its path. Whilst clumsy overall, you can't really mess up the reveal of the iconic mask with Williams' Imperial March on your side. But think again: what was the audience's favourite moment from Rogue One? The origin of the topsy turvy direction of this sequel series lies with JJ Abrams himself, who, with a completely empty palette and the Big Mouse's blessing to blast off into a new era, decided to press the reset button instead. Watching TFA again, it's little more than high budget fan-fiction, a glossy update of a galaxy far, far away, and yet so strangely familiar. The film emblazoned what we recognise as Abrams' trademark blockbuster stamp: zippy, lighter-than-air dialogue, zippier action sequences with sparks and explosions galore that never seem to kill anyone of importance, and a decidedly unpretentious giddiness in unveiling the fact that the Star Wars universe was returning to the big screen once more. And at the time, in the naive, innocent epoch of 2015, that was enough.Oh, my sweet summer child. But who could blame us? We were just glad that the path ahead was course-correcting, that we could forget about Hayden Christiansen's pickup lines, that Star Wars, yes, the real Star Wars, was back. It didn't matter that we were circling back to the days of the Jedi order, even after Lucas' unintentional highlighting of the code's inherent hypocrisy and megalomania. Every Abrams misstep in Episode 7 is exacerbated in TROS, but it all began with TLJ. In more ways than one it is the Empire of the new trilogy; provocative in asking deeper questions of the franchise's status quo, transformative in its tonal shift away from the genre film. I had somehow mistakenly remembered Del Toro's character achieving redemption by coming to the rescue of Finn and Rose aboard the ship, as if I didn't trust the most popular film franchise of all time to be a little braver with its morality. But no, he sells them out, takes the money and runs, leaving behind his realpolitik take on all these wars in the stars, 'They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It's just business.'He's wrong, of course, but in the wake of the final episode it's frustrating to see these crumbs being dropped and not picked up again. On a literal level, Finn and Rose embody the many scattered citizens of the galaxy that are just waiting for the call to rise up and rebel against evil. That's why Rey receives the necklace from a child on Pasaana, and that's why Canto Bight happened - the Force is a currency for hope across the galaxy, and our protagonists are its messengers. There's an entire character devoted to this in Jannah, but instead of grounding the story, she's reduced to being a plot device to get Finn from point A to point B. Zora Bliss suffers a similar fate, her ongoing 'will they won't they' with Poe a larger priority than her actual grievances against the Empire. Lando miraculously emerges with an entire battalion of rebel starships ready to take on the Final Order, yet we're left scratching our heads at where they were when Leia last sent out a distress signal. The surprise reveal is especially pitiful in the wake of Endgame sticking its landing in that department, indicating that these moments need to be earned. Without any stakes, they're just a cheap, faceless deus ex machina. On a more philosophical level, DJ's not the first to point out that the light side of the force isn't as pure and virtuous as advertised. This was TLJ's sub-thesis and the first thing that everyone, myself included, latched upon. Rian Johnson sought to unshackle the franchise of the baggage that is the unquestionable reverence of the Jedi order and its mythos, going beyond the simple binary of blue = goodie and red = baddie.You'd presume that after a prequel series which prioritised lightsaber choreography over moral nuance and intricate characterisation that audiences would appreciate this. But the fan response to Luke's midlife crisis and the resulting amendments in TROS confirm the worst: that Star Wars fans would rather bury their heads in the sand and remain hopelessly devoted to their nostalgia-infused memories than confront a newer, more complex age of storytelling. Their version of these films has Luke striding out like a hero, flipping around like geriatric Yoda, and wielding a minimum of four lightsabers. Lucas forgot that a battle is only as engaging as the clash of characters behind them. Compare of any of his incoherent glowstick brawls to Obi-Wan or Luke's last stand, the latter of which prioritises the culmination of an emotional arc over the physicality or choreography of the actual duel. We recognise the significance of the mentor confronting his mistakes and placing his newly-found faith in the next generation. Where's the intrigue in facing Darth Maul, or General Grievous? You can't stage a meaningful fight against an opponent whose sole appeal is in how menacing they appear or how many lightsabers they have.But who cares about all that? Rey unlocked dual wield, baby! The climatic clash of TROS is pitched at a juvenile level, the auditory equivalent of the cavalry arriving at Geonosis, ripped straight out of every shounen manga ever. Abrams' insistence in necessitating this for Rey's triumph over Palpatine removes her agency and strips her victory of any individual achievement, advocating instead for a crowdfunded effort bolstered by figures she has no personal connection to. The connection personal for only the audience, and this is what the film sells. Again and again, Abrams favours fan gratification over storytelling. It's so blindingly obvious that he wanted to finish on the iconic duel sunset, and so he forcefully engineers the plot towards this conclusion at the cost of any thematic logic; Tatooine was what was holding Luke back from his hero's journey, and Leia's never even set foot on its sandy plains. The sum of it all resembles a laundry list of moments where the overhead 'clap now' sign flashes to the audience, ushering in cheers and whoops, as the characters breezily lightspeed skip to the next dot point.The most egregious of these betrays the film's lack of confidence in its characterisation, in that no one can really be significant without a significant past. Its predecessors set up a neat duality between Rey and Kylo, the former having every reason to become jaded and bitter at the world after being abandoned by her parents, and the latter given every resource and opportunity to take on the mantle of the next Jedi Master. To take Kylo's story and transfer it over to Rey, and to have the source of that conflict be a strained connection to a character we thought long dead is both disappointing and expected of a franchise so obsessed with its own legacy. Abrams leans on the 'surprise!' factor of the Palpatine twist more than its repercussions, and in doing so invalidates Rey's genuine struggles with being nobody by taking the easy way out. Whoops, just kidding! You have to be a Skywalker or at the very least a Solo if you want to be anything more than a disposable background character. The film's opening hurtles at lightspeed, hoping that we don't think too hard about these developments, while the protagonists engage in what can only be described as a grotesque version of Sorkin's ping-pong dialogue. Let's not stop and breathe for a moment, and spend some time unpacking some of this subtext or growth.The Rise of Skywalker reveals that Star Wars is going through an identity crisis. These films meant a great deal once, and they can mean a great deal today, but they can't be the same thing. The days of the space opera riffing off pulpy serials is over. Look at the Stormtrooper helmet; it's goofy, and the updated sheen of the new Disney renditions doesn't change that. Chewbacca is literally a tall British guy in a bear costume, roaring nonsense. Captain Phasma is given roughly the same screen time and agency as the legendary Boba Fett, but none of the reverence. No one has never aimed the criticisms of her character towards him, because there's nostalgia involved, and that means the stakes are personal. This kind of attachment isn't a bad thing - the open scrawl and fanfare transports us all to a galaxy we've cherished for decades, but nostalgia is fleeting in its comfort, and eventually the story must evolve. THAT was the essence of The Last Jedi, in the immortal words of Yoda. We are what they grow beyond. Burning the sacred Jedi texts doesn't mean erasing the past, but embracing its mistakes and learning from them in looking towards the future. The Rise of Skywalker is a regressive move. It runs in the opposite direction.",5,18,28,11 January 2020
"Monsters, Inc."," We Scare, Because We Care
","The world of Monster's Inc. is not unlike our own, but it is scattered with little detailed twists that a monster city would - deodorants that come in an assortment of gross flavours, side- walk grills that become a hazard for unsuspecting slimes, the various shaped body suits of the CDF, even adjusted idioms ('first time I laid eye on you') ...It's all very convincing and lends credence to the very original and creative premise of Pixar's fourth. The animation holds up well and also helps with the world building; whether it's the 2.3 million individual hairs of Sulley that bounce and bristle with life, or the very complicated sequence of thousands of moving doors that must have been a nightmare to storyboard and coordinate. But it's the characters that really bring Monster's Inc. to life. Monster's University, the sequel more than a decade later, wound back time and placed original characters in a rather by- the-numbers college movie, with the usual jocks and geeks that arise in that genre. In MI, they are less one dimensional and more complex; and the voice acting is equally great. John Goodman brings a jovial and good natured Sulley to the screen, so convincing that its surprisingly scary when he finally bares his teeth and roar, the audience reacting as effectively as Boo does ('I'm off duty'). Billy Crsytal voices Mike, the wise cracking joker and best friend, delivering both juvenile and adult humour, while Steve Buscemi is Randall, the slimy rival scarer that has darker intentions. James Coburn is Waternoose, the well rounded boss who thinks first and foremost for his family's company, but also expresses regret at banishing his favourite scarer. The scene stealer is Boo, played by a infant Mary Gibbs, so young that they had to follow her around the studio and record sound bites which make up her gibberish speech. She's animated with such care and precision - there's a wonderful irony in the way she pops up in Monstropolis and says boo adorably, only to have every scary monster in sight run for their lives. Her and Sulley's relationship make up much of the emotional core of Monster's Inc. and it progresses with remarkable realism and pacing. Goodman exposes the very confines of Sulley's heart, looking beneath the agile and powerful frame that the animation presents. It's a very touching and sometimes funny relationship that develops gradually and begins to even intrude into the long lasting bond that he has with Mike. There's such a poignancy to the way Goodman delivers the line 'Did you see the way she looked at me?' that conjures up a wealth of subtext about the overall premise of the film, their careers, the ethics of scaring innocent children the growing fatherly role he has adopted for Boo...it's neatly tied up in the ending when they switch to comedy instead of horror (which gives Mike a new-found responsibility and role) and also is much kinder and fun for the kids. The little bits of laughter from Boo and their effects throughout the film foreshadow this nicely. Randy Newman's score is also an important element. The jazzy big band influence is apparent from the opening credits sequence, and also excels in the stand out track The Scare Floor, played in the very first reveal of the elite Scarers making their way into the room and preparing for another day of screaming. The percussion beats build steadily and prepares the audience, while the jazz section swings with a wonderful rhythm that goes well with the hard work and chaos of the scare floor. The award winning is If I Didn't Have You is saccharine and pleasant, if not a little similar to Toy Story's You've Got a Friend In Me, but Goodman and Crystal play off each other well. Monster's Inc. delivers laughs and emotionally rich moments for both children and adults and is another demonstration of Pixar's ability to seamlessly combine the two in a creative and original premise.",9,0,1,29 July 2015
Ant-Man," Ant-thony
","The last entry to the second phase of the MCU. This has a sort of inverse problem compared to Ultron, which was dark and sleek and threatened to end the world but had one liners leaking out like no tomorrow. This is a much smaller scaled movie and the humour is allowed to be fresh because we are only just being introduced to these characters and the stakes aren't that high anyway. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's ridiculously jarring. Michael Peña is Luis, Scott's Mexican jailmate, who carries an infectious enthusiasm and spends much of the film with a big childish grin on his face as if he's the only one aware that he is living out a Marvel comic-book. His best moments are characterised by these multi-layered flashbacks where he details the dodgy sources of his tips, and where each encounter's edits are accompanied by a loud whoosh like a sitcom cutting to a different scene, and his lovable bumbling voice-over perfectly matches with the larger than life characters in his ludicrous story. The camera zooms eagerly into these little recreations and we are immediately keyed into how unreliable Luis is, but just how much he wants to help. Less effective are the other two wombats. One cannot even be dubbed a black stereotype for how shallow his character is; he provides a distraction by momentarily taking a police car on a joyride and does seldom else. The other is the textbook computer whiz combined with Russian mobster, whose accent is much thicker than need be and mumbles out heist phrases whilst having a grammar crisis. And there's Hope, the partly estranged daughter whom harbours tension and resentment solely because of a secret that needs to be revealed midway through for plot reasons. She features in one of the worse training montages I have ever seen in a movie. We first get repetition of a small but simple task, which is met with comedic failure, familiar as always. Then there is a need to learn how to punch, which somehow means martial arts with Hope. Why isn't there another way of demonstrating strength in a female character apart from some head-scissors hurricana takedown? In the midst of it we get a jarring insert of plot, where a sly mention of the deceased mother and wife is slipped in, to grins (yes, really). Right after is a more sentimental moment, where Hank Pym warns of the dangers of going sub-atomic (it's better that they don't try to explain it), but of course that is met with tonal whiplash from the cheerful Scott. He later does the same thing as father and daughter reunite and embrace, and this is comedy for the sake of it, except it is not funny, just awkward and forced. And finally we have the ultimate test of...willpower, which seems to be the abstract source behind controlling the ants. As long as Rudd squints his eyes and concentrates hard enough, the task can be done. Is this an anime?Even amongst a see-sawing tone, there are action sequences that are quite thrilling. The deft balance of macro and life size means that each sensation in the Ant-Man suit is heightened to its fullest. It would be easy to fill the first sequence with many slow motion gigantic objects and people about to crush him, but there are also plenty of shots away from his POV which do a much better job of demonstrating his tiny figure; the tilt-shift selective focus enhances his profile through a crowd of feet in a nightclub, on a spinning record, in a grimy bathtub, on a carpet that seems like a surface inside a toy house. The sound design is also excellent in portraying this; the crashing boom of a huge belt buckle, a tap stream turned into a tsunami, the little dink as he bounces down a pipe and onto the roof of a taxi, barely making a scratch. Later, we have these clever cuts that provide both comedy and context, as we shift worlds. They battle amongst floating giant lolly wrappers, phones and keys, as The Cure's Disintegration blasts and buzzes depending on whether we are inside or outside of the briefcase, before a very frank shot of a simple object falling into the pool. This is later again used as the fury of the battle is contrasted with Cassie's POV of tiny little lasers and little flies buzzing around, and the sound of entire train carriages exploding and the menacing whistle cuts to a dink as Thomas the Tank Engine toys topple over. It's unfortunate that the main villain is once again disappointing as per Marvel. All throughout we get Cross and Hank verbally battling and clashing egos, and we sense a deeper motive here, but there is almost nothing to go on, zero subtext to interpret. Stoll's performance is very much mechanically generic, playing the usual mad scientist who feels wronged and has to take back what he feels is rightfully his. But his speech is casual, and his threats shallow, and so there is no build-up or moment where he becomes the vengeful Yellowjacket. Douglas murmurs about a younger him, brasher, bolder, more arrogant, but this does not exist anywhere but in the words of the script, or in Cross. Sure, the costume design is sleek and frightening and well animated as a Marvel blockbuster should have, but there is only so much it can do. The best performance therefore must go to the child actress playing Cassie. Unlike her mother and step-father who reek of lazy writing, her character is simple, innocent and displays the most authentic emotions out of the entire cast. Does it really matter if Scott plot-devices his way out of the climax? She makes it worthwhile to sit through and root for Ant-Man.",6,0,2,19 November 2015
Fargo," And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day.
","In Fargo, the Coen brothers demonstrate their sheer mastery and control of black comedic tone, laying siege to a small, unsuspecting Minnesotan town with a grand criminal conspiracy. At least, that is how the opening captions announce it, white text on black, alerting the audience to its degree of seriousness and authenticity. This little white lie riffs on the same types of preludes often seen in true crime stories or serials such as Dragnet, always beginning with the ominous brass theme and a warning: 'The story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.' And listen to how Carter Burwell's score serenades the opening shot of a car slowly appearing in deep fog, a Norwegian folk tune beginning with a few bells and whistles but then soaring to a crescendo of operatic ridiculousness. If Fargo takes place in chilly, rural North Dakota, mostly forgotten by America, its male characters certainly don't believe it. They think (or desire) themselves as self-made men, figures that can withstand the harsh winter and forge a path ahead. Much like that Paul Bunyan fella. We are firstly introduced to Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy in a career-defining performance of such spinelessness that every time he is cornered by a shred of decency, he finds some way to weasel out of it. The genius of the Coens is to continually place him in situations that guide him to do the right thing, only to watch as Jerry splutters and fumbles an excuse for his wrongs. The opening pits his virtues against two hardened criminals (or that is the front they put up) who end up questioning his motives: why would a man want to kidnap his own wife, and why does he not simply ask his father-in-law for the money? Further scenes ramp up the dramatic irony as we witness his mastermind scheme fall to pieces; he sweats on the spot when Wade threatens to wrest control of his double-crossing, fretting not for his wife but for the handsome profit slipping through his fingers. The cruel irony is that his one moment of capability is stolen from him; on paper the numbers are solid, the plan looks fool-proof, but even this he cannot take full credit for. 'It's my deal here!' he squeaks as a million dollars floats away, and with it the last vestiges of his father-in-law's approval. This vein of quiet desperation and foolish masculinity continues in Carl, who repeatedly finds himself at odds with the small-town milieu. Like Jerry, he is obsessed with material gain beyond decency, a sore thumb sticking out from the rural tapestry of kitsch: relentless good cheer, comically exaggerated accents, an almost alien sense of satisfaction with their modest lives. His encounters are marked by cultural clashes aggravated by his incessant greed - his fury at having to surrender four dollars to an ever-smiling parking attendant, later revisited with a bloody twist, and the eye-popping incredulity he wears and elicits when he erupts at Grimsrud for suggesting they split the Sierra, never mind the million dollars he has already stashed away for himself. This hyper-virile brand of foolishness sees the men stumble in the ice and snow, discarded by their out-dated fantasies of power and control. Visually, the film presents winter as a gloomy mood in itself; there is seldom a hard shadow in Deakins' photography, but the residents are all smiles. Jerry, on the other hand, hacks with futility at his ice-covered windshield, and shrinks considerably when challenged on his Trucoat scam. Watch Carl literally interrupted mid-orgasm and handily beaten; he acts as if he owns the place, but he can't even get the waiter's attention. The strong sense of place is crucial to Fargo's subversion of these fantasies and overarching genre expectations. The men come from the city hoping to cash in on Jerry's big score, but are physically rejected by the locale. It is through the sheer naivety and optimism of Fargo and Brainerd's residents that the Coens funnel their comedy, so blind to the evil intentions of the criminals that they simply carry on without a care. Jean knits and hums absentmindedly while watching daytime television, achieving a peace of mind that her husband could never be content with, and when a masked man with a crowbar taps at her back door, her first reaction is a curious tilt of the head. Various other interviewed witnesses convey the same mild bewilderment that a crime of such caliber could ever arrive at their doorstep - the affair is treated with the same amount of concern as the weather, or the score of last night's hockey game, interspersed with a few 'Yah' and 'Oh yah's along the way. Fargo's slippery case of shifting protagonists sees it ditch Jerry for Marge, the film's cheery antithesis to the desperation and egotism of its men. Notice the precision of Frances McDormand's incredulity and disappointment she levels at Jerry, who thinks he can flee from his crimes, and at Gaear, who without a second thought stuffs his partner into a woodchipper. She scolds him like a child, 'There's more to life than money, ya know?', and praises her husband's three cent stamp as if it was worth a million dollars. Could her character survive in today's films? Look at her counterpart in the Fargo television series. Carrie Coon's Gloria is at odds with modern technology and its overarching structures - automatic doors won't respond to her, and justice hides in a bureaucratic maze. She represents a righteousness that seems rarer and rarer each day, a morality no longer worth its weight, buffeted at every turn by larger forces out of her control. But Fargo sees her worth. Fargo believes that decent people get their turn, and that it's okay if the result is only a three cent stamp and cheap buffets. If only we had less Jerry Lundegaards, and more Marge Gundersons.",10,1,2,28 June 2017
Notting Hill," I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
","Stories of class divide are almost always fascinating and will be told for many years to come, mainly because that wondrous, utopic vision of full automation and zero work is still so far away. They've become familiar enough to us to enter the cultural psyche; I'm thinking of time-tested tales like Cinderella and The Prince and the Pauper, with ideals so simple and inspiring that even Disney cartoons can appropriate them. This also means that any movie that wants to tackle the issue is facing an uphill battle. In Notting Hill, we chuckle because of the sheer coincidence of the spilling of the drink, and because we know that little innocuous incident will spark so much more. But we also don't expect it to be that easy for Will and Anna - it wouldn't be a movie if it didn't wait up until the very last minute for the pair to truly realise what they mean to each other. The true strength of Notting Hill is how it lifts its characters out of these tried and tested archetypes. Roberts has all the makings of a glamorous Hollywood goddess, so we expect her to be a little high-minded, a little dismissive of the residents of Notting Hill, which has charm, but not the glitz of the Boulevard. Yet the movie resists the temptation to establish her as some snotty brat to be humbled by the family, to go through a re-evaluation of her entire life just because of a culture shock. One of the best scenes has her going toe-to-toe with Will's family, in dinner talk that is highly characteristic of British humour and self-depreciation, laced with the right amount of darkness. Anna is tender enough to join in on their game and open up a little about herself, but more importantly she also shares their ability of self-awareness and being able to laugh at herself. She's not merely a high and mighty aspiration for Will to strive for, but put through her own challenges, and though she may have millions, we come to understand that this does not mean her emotions can be easily discarded. This lovable bunch, reminiscent of another in Curtis' Four Weddings and a Funeral, are immediately likable because they feel like real characters, not merely bits of Will's modest, working class tapestry. They have real lives and struggles outside the window from which we view them through the film's plot, and we can see that they care deeply about each other. They might go wacko when they first meet Anna, a little starstruck as most might be, but also show their fierce loyalty to Will when they realise that he has been hurt and needs emotional support. One of the marvels of the Thacker family is in how their depiction normalises disability - Bella's condition slips into their stories, loves and jokes with ease, and we witness how the others adapt to it. It is accepted as a fact of life rather than something that defines her. So if anything it might be Will that is the weak link. Try as I might it's difficult to see him being so bogged down by heartbreak and situation. This is, after all, Hugh Grant at his peak, roguishly and lazily handsome, carrying himself with an aloofness and effortlessness about him like the wavy parting in his hair. He even has too goofy sidekicks at both home and work to accentuate his relative sanity. It's a pity that most of the men in Notting Hill are obnoxious, sex- crazed pigs, the most egregious intrusion being Alec Baldwin, who's unshaven and crass, and who all but sneers dismissively at the help before shoving his tongue down Anna's throat. The relationship is defined not by Will's own character, but rather how special and different he may be to all the other male suitors out there. He's modest in dress and tone, shacked up in a bookstore away from all the glamour and gossip of the world, and it is not him but her that initiates the sex instead.Anna, after all, is looking for that diamond in the rough that won't give her the concessions of a film star but treat her like an ordinary human being with flaws and weaknesses, and it's not an unfair request. Her characters are are exaggerated, over- the-top heroines, and all she wants is someone that realises there is a person behind those portrayals. And along the way we shake and bury our heads in our hands as they navigate the more typical conventions of the genre, and how the story inevitably twists their words and inserts convenient inconveniences to trip them up and try as hard as it can to tear them apart. It isn't immune from the dramatic confrontations and spillings of the heart of the rom-com; in fact it happens twice, and we can understand both perspectives. And the music cues are obvious and cheesy, these days borderlining on self-parody. But aren't they just part of the package? We go into Notting Hill expecting to be comforted and satisfied, and it delivers exactly what we want.",7,0,1,13 December 2016
North by Northwest," I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
","North by Northwest's aesthetic is stylish yet anxious - the now iconic opening titles arrange the text in rigid, geometric lines splayed across the screen in 3d, and below, reflecting on the vast mirrors of skyscrapers, citizens milling and scuttling like an insect collective, bond by a single instinct to survive. The post-war modernity, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, the slick decor, the stylish fashion, all marred by the contextual Cold War paranoia. The leading man is thrust out of the masses into a plot of spiralling complexity and mystery, but of course he is no spy, but another everyman just trying to get by (and early on we have that overhead shot of the UN escape making him tiny like an ant). The film resolves to get more out of him; to fill that big, empty 'O' in the middle of his name and in short, be a man his mother would be proud of. The film's plot would be torn apart into shreds these days, but back then it was the spy thriller before 007, and Phillip Vandamm is the Bond villain before there were Bond villains. His closing of the shutters and atmospheric lamp is the spinning chair and stroking cat of the 60s. His villainy does not subscribe to subtlety, so we have the showy, evil monologue, where they circle each other like they were in a gladiatorial arena, and then the least inconspicuous way of murdering an enemy agent. For every dodgy rear projection car scene we have the crop duster, still a marvel to this day. The torched brown wheat-fields, the rural American icon, transformed into something of an expressionist nightmare taking its cues from the German movement; the geometric rigidity of the horizon, two tiny figures intersecting at perfect right angles, the undeviating rows of gold. The overhead wide shot betrays nothing - airplanes and buses materialise out of nowhere, and the mystery is only furthered. Nevertheless Hitchcock does veer in gratuitous territory every now and again. The appearance and lengthy seduction of Eva Marie Saint as a sort of crimson guardian angel is as risqué as they come, and Lehman can't help but pause the tension for few well directed one- liners and suggestive whispers. It is only empowered by later revelations that paint the scene in a new light as a jolt in her confined life. This theme comes together in a stunning reveal at the auction; it starts on the blonde back of Kendall's head, with Vandamm's hand caressing and wrapping around her like suffocating tendrils, then slowly pulls back to reveal the rest of the auction and lastly Thornhill's spurned glare. Hitchcock is channeling a similar vibe on obsession and possession as he did in Vertigo, and Kendall's blonde locks and red dress stick out disturbingly in the crowd. A masterful reveal with pure image, though I suppose it is slightly undercut by Grant's annoyance (rather than what we would expect and are shown, fury) and slapstick antics in messing with the bidding. Of course what Hitchcock really wanted to do was a climatic sequence atop Mount Rushmore. The final set was a giant replica of the famed carvings, and it holds up rather well, projecting a sense of depth from high up above down to the rocky cliffs below. The action staging is a little less exciting than a modern audience would have liked - Hitchcock had to cut from wide shots of the real site to closeups of the replica for the actual action, resulting in a rather stilted sequence of events where they are eventually rescued by the agency. And the way Grant struggles to pull Saint up from over a cliff, and how his desperation turns into a slight smile as the scene transitions forwards onto a train bed? Pure silliness and sentimental theatricality, but at least they are openly admitting it. We can't help but crack a grin as the train rushes into the tunnel.",9,1,3,19 April 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," He didn't ask for his powers, but he chose to be Spider-Man.
","I've always maintained that Spider-Man 2 is the greatest superhero movie of all time, and that starts with its Peter Parker. Early 2000s Tobey Maguire is a loser, let's face it. A scooter half-helm with a click-on strap isn't exactly a fashionable accessory, but for him it completes the look, the Amazing Spider-Man by night, a pizza delivery boy (boy, not man) by day. When he's consumed by the black symbiote in the Raimi trilogy's climax, that results in an unmentionable scene (even this iteration acknowledges this embarrassment). But isn't that just a perfect encapsulation of Maguire's Parker? He's not only the underdog, he's the furthest thing from cool. Before he was given those powers, he was Peter Parker first, and nothing can change that. The poignancy in this contrast is only heightened when he is passed down (Christ-like) through the train by the citizens he has saved, a normal New Yorker in a rubber suit.That's why I've never really gotten on board with Tom Holland's Peter Parker (and the less said about Andrew Garfield, the better). He might face the same stakes as the teenage Miles Morales here, juggling great power and responsibility with English homework and the pitfalls of the high school social scene, but his faux-confidence just feels like confidence. Holland puts on the same 'I've got to save the world single-handedly' bravado as Shameik Moore, but that's belied by the fact that he's scheduled to face the world-ending threat of the Mad Titan Thanos just a few weeks after he first suits up. I can't buy his nerdy, outcast role when Holland is practically a teenage heartthrob, either.We've come a long way from the awkward split-screens of Ang Lee's live action Hulk, but finally filmmakers have found a way of transferring the comic book aesthetic onto film. Spider-Verse is an electric jolt, an all-caps SPLAT amidst the conveyor belt of the MCU's codified blockbuster gloss, 3D motion amongst CGI flatness. Just watching the film is a joy in itself, as the directors lift the most eye-popping parts of the print medium onto the screen. From the squiggly lines of the Spider-sense, to the dialogue boxes that follow the action across the frame, to the way the half tone dots blend neon colours, you could pause at any moment and have the perfect wallpaper. Not that you need to; the directors speed-ramp at precisely the perfect moments to mimic the double-spread freeze-frames of the comic book, all without halting the fluidity of the action sequences. In, and then out.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse comes at the right time, as the superhero film that audiences never knew we wanted, free from buckling under the strain and obligations of franchise building. Marvel captured lightning in a bottle with the witty irreverence of Pratt's Star-Lord, then proceeded to use that same brand of humour as a mouthpiece for the majority of their characters (turning one with the epithet of 'the Destroyer' into a silly punchline machine). Turns out, Holland's charm isn't nearly as endearing delivered in the face of universal doom. This tone is a little more appropriate as nervous prods in the dialogue of a transferring teenager still trying to find his place in 2nd period, let alone the world.From the way the opening web-swings past the baggage of the Spider-Man franchise, deftly sidestepping the usual burdens of yet another origin story, we know we're in for a blast. The script is well aware of the audience's fatigue, riffing off our expectations through the meta commentary of a middle-aged, alternate universe Peter Parker. This jaded, washed up superhero speaks for all of us, and exposes the life that awaits these godlike figures after stardom. In that respect, he makes for the perfect partner for Miles, the pair of them foils for each other. In covering for his teenage protegee, Peter rediscovers part of his bygone heroism, which in turns inspires Morales to take up the mantle of his own neighbourhood's (or universe) Spider-Man. In a way, he is more a father figure than any of the other points of the Morales family triangle. He sacrifices his own life so a teenager doesn't have to, but leaves the option open for Miles to make that choice from himself. And when the suit fits, it fits snugly.",8,0,1,16 March 2019
Edward Scissorhands," Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.
","A reclusive inventory is in the business of automatic cookie making machines. How very nice and sweet, if the machine didn't look like a devilish contraption with all sorts of hissing and blades and dangling arms. Then he has the idea to build a living machine that will serve as his son, as an answer to his loneliness. For some reason or another, he decides to fasten ten long scissor blades instead of fingers, and just as he is about to attach human hands, he drops dead right on the spot. How very twisted, and how very Burton. The decrepit mansion that Edward resides in recalls all the Gothic horror of the past, with its arches and curling stairwells and ominous statues. This doesn't trouble Peg Boogs at all. Dianne Weist is such a tremendous actress; she carries an endless motherly quality about her, with her creased smile and squinted eyes, and even when she is angry she is not really angry, but huffs and puffs and tries to reconsider. Here she considers all the ominous signs of the abandoned mansion on top of the hill, sticking out like a sore thumb in the barbie house neighbourhood, and approaches it anyway. She titters as she prances up the spiny, dusty stairway: 'I'm your local Avon representative!' Burton shows awareness of the classic monster stories (Frankenstein, Beauty and the Beast). He clearly sets Peg up us the unwitting victim, crawling into the trap of the horror. So it is a pleasant surprise when Peg starts recommending beauty products to cover up his scars, and then decides to up and take him home with her. What a ticklishly funny image; the ghostly white, oversized Edward hunched in the front seat, and the ever-smiling Peg driving along as if she was just picking up a friend.The town is a cute little caricature, with a chic colour scheme full of lime greens, bright pinks, baby blues, and so on, more garish and lurid as time goes on. Even the cars are colour-coded, and when they pull out of their driveway, they do so in sync with each other, and drive off to work in a conga line. So Edward's freakish appearance seems the complete antithesis of such a bright neighbourhood, but in reality he fits right in. The women gossip and fawn over his ability to garden and style their hair, and force feed him their food like a baby, and the men slap him on the back and bust his balls. Bill encourages him to charge for his services, and even to open his own business, so it is no surprise that the freak is normalised as soon as he finds a use for his bizarre tools. Depp is a cartoon character come to life. His hair sticks out in a messy manner of different directions as if he is being constantly electrified, and when his hands whir and get to work, we get the same type of cartoonish animation, with bits of hair and bush spitting out and flying everywhere until he reveals his masterpiece. The performance is a strongly physical one; what could be said in a few whispered words, Depp prefers to show in his body language. Edward is in a permanently hunched state, his gangly scissorhands dangling down from his already long limbs, giving him the appearance of a grotesque monster. But it is one of those 'it's more scared of you' situations; Depp's wide, frightened eyes betraying an innocence that clashes with his appearance, and when he stalks out of Kim's room after both frightening each other, the mechanical awkwardness in his strides and the way he holds his hands is first endearing, then scary. It is all wrapped up in a somewhat convincing love story. It is the beauty and the beast finding unlikely love, except in this instance the beauty has an arrogant, thuggish boyfriend that defies belief that anyone could fall for him. He is the designated baddie, the fall guy (literally), and therefore only slightly imagined and fleshed out. For the viewer it is only a matter of time before Kim and Jim become Kim and Edward. But even the latter only lasts for a brief moment, with Kim making the sacrifice for the sake of Edward's safety. The film is framed by a lovely narrative device plucked straight from a children's fairytale. You can almost hear the little boy tuckered up in his sheets, asking 'Granny, where does snow come from?'",8,0,0,24 July 2016
The White Ribbon," Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte
","In The White Ribbon, Haneke's mastery of building a quiet, unassuming dread is evident. It starts almost cartoonish, as an elderly school teacher recounts the events of the fabled village that have faded into legend and obscurity. He narrates via voice-over as the doctor's horse is suddenly tripped and he is flung from its seat. Who could have put it there? Little things begin happening that plunge us deeper and deeper into the mystery. Birds are found impaled with scissors. Children are found strung up and beaten. A disabled boy has his eyes gouged out. The villagers look at each other, and then avert their eyes because it could be any of them. In the midst of the crowd is the school teacher, who attempts to get to the bottom of the incidents while also wooing the young Eva. It is not entirely a whodunit. Haneke prefers not to give straight answers, and the voice-over admits that these events are not as crystal clear as he once experienced them. Perhaps he is the film's straightest character, and this slightly smoothens its edge. In one instance, in the period of their one year engagement, he plans a lake-side picnic for Eva and him, but within the context of the village's violence incidents, she does not feel safe about being all alone with him. His response to this establishes the moral pillar of the film from where everything else is judged, and he is the one to make the final accusation. This subplot does not entirely fit within the rest of the events; their quiet, giggling conversations and simple romance is so removed from the rest of the simmering tension. Haneke, I think, seeks to invite viewers to align themselves with this bespectacled every-man, and then harshly shakes his head at this decision. But even without the connotations of the rise of fascism and terrorism as Haneke has been so outspoken on (see how the narrator resolves to dig for the roots of national socialism, not fascism, and how he is suggested to have survived World War 2 - and then link the ages of the children to the date), it is a tremendously disturbing film, yet plausible. Haneke at first distances us from these events via these still long shots that do not outright display the atrocities that are being committed, but rather hint at them, as the muffled sounds of a beating emerge from behind a closed door. And then it becomes more evident, but revealed with great terror. Kurti peers behind a closed door to see his father and sister against each other, and subtly she slides down her dress while spinning a alternate explanation. When the steward's little boy presents a stolen bird to compensate for the one impaled, he is beaten senseless for being too young to understand the implications of his crime. The last shot gradually cuts away to a distance until the village is framed by the black bars of the gate, but Haneke does not ever leave these confines. He suggests that in such a closed environment it becomes so easy to stir up these hypocrisies and cycles of repression until we get...something beyond morally compromising. Haneke does attempt to draw comparisons between the terror that is political versus that of a religious nature. There are murmurs of a mother's death in the sawmills, and how the baron is dismissive of this, and how the villagers retaliate namelessly. And then there is the hypocrisy of the pastor, who preaches an absolute love and behind closed doors, practices an absolute discipline of faith that is theorised to be the root cause of these incidents. But it is also suggested that they share the same root problem, a human tendency to mutate into absolutism and authoritarianism without any opposition. How else will children learn if not from their parental figures? In this little village, there is no other answer.",8,0,2,4 February 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible: Bond Nation
","Once again, Ethan Hunt is on the run and forced to conduct a lone mission. This film is oddly paced. We flit from location to location, proving that the mysterious lethal organisation named The Syndicate is well and truly global. Establishing landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben orientate us through this mission. But it doesn't exactly feel much different from one another, but rather like a video game campaign where each leveled mission takes us through another setting. There is a high speed motorcycle chase in Morocco which quickly exits the distinct and dusty architecture of Rabat for a sleek highway that could be anywhere in the world. The final chase scene features yet another scuffle with the goons of our main villain Lane and is utterly drab in the night. For all the heroic stunt manoeuvres on the side of a plane (and no, doing his own stunts does not make a movie better, but it is admirable somewhat), Hunt spends some weird moments boxed into confined and uninteresting environments. After escaping from a torture chamber in what is an utterly incomprehensible action scene featuring a flurry of cuts for each punch or kick thrown, he runs down a hallway and then inexplicably is in some phone booth in the city elsewhere. In the climatic showdown, the hero and villain pair run into some abandoned museum, fall into a vent thing (where it all started right) and viola, there you have the master plan. Sean Harris is the villain, and not a very good one. Like so many before him, he is good turned evil, and thus his has concocted nefarious intentions in his payback. He has several monologues, none of which are assisted by his raspy voice which ends up rather wimpy (I suppose menacing is what they were going for), and he waxes lyrical on how he must bring about change to the world and metaphorical comparing himself to a surgeon and blah blah blah this is a very bland and shallow character. Not helping is the blocking and coverage which seems bizarre at times; Ilsa and him meet at a cemetery (and the ridiculous abundance of shallow focus all but obscures the background anyway), and some sort of threat is once again issued, and he demonstrates his hold over her, but meanwhile they walk and stop and walk again so casually it might be some romantic stroll in the park. Harris' best moment is his trembling facial tics as he struggles against Hunt reversing the odds on him in the climax, but the countdown timer does not seem particularly necessary. Surely a trigger would offer a lot more control? It's not surprising, but much of Rogue Nation's plot is dished out via exposition in rooms upon rooms. Renner, Baldwin and Rhames are all criminally underused because of this, and they spend most of the film idle but somehow being in the right place to explain the right thing, somehow having the means to magically further the plot. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson fortunately does not fall to that same fate, and plays a crucial Bond girl type role in the two best action sequences. The mission to steal the Syndicate ledger from a highly secure facility is classic Mission Impossible, and its entertainment value speaks for itself. As always, they go over the plan and each intricate detail, discussing in voice-over, and this sort of thing is common in this genre, but it's done really well. Partly because they it is treated lighter than usual, with Pegg chiming in with his impeccable comedic delivery ('That doesn't sound impossible!') and soft nodding to the previous installments of the series with both Benji and Hunt inquiring about alternate methods. The scene itself is gripping. Silence is used effectively here; there is nothing but the swimming strokes and bubbles in the track as Hunt makes his way to over to 108, but we still know that something is about to go wrong, and it's all the more tense when it finally does hit him. The camera drifts away slowly as he loses consciousness, and only after a extended wait, where we are almost actually made to believe our hero is done for, then the soundtrack flares in and Ilsa makes her rescue.The other sequence, and perhaps the best scene in the movie, is the attempted assassination in the opera in Vienna. Voyeuristic overhead angles shots and effective cutting between the opposing perspectives of the snipers orientates us within the backstage of the opera stage, and we are treated to this tense but slow moving chase between several combatants to the backdrop of Turandot and the blaring operatic tune of Nessun dorma. The sound mixing here is particularly excellent and appropriate; it dips and rises in volume as Hunt plays a game of cat and mouse backstage, and it all but drowns out any noise that the urgent fist fights cause. But this only adds urgency to the perilous battle on top of those platforms; the choreography is desperate but subdued as they are silhouetted in the blue lighting while the crowds below are unaware. Admittedly, I haven't been diligently following this franchise but it is successful at what it does and Cruise shows remarkable ability even at this age. Ultimately this is one of those movies that you wouldn't hate to discover while flicking through channels. In several cases, Renner's Brandt attempts to be the voice of reason and tries to dispel any notion of heroics or peril, but Hunt waves him away and maps out yet another mission impossible. And isn't that what we want to see anyway?",7,2,4,16 November 2015
Dark City," The night never ends here.
","The world of Dark City is frighteningly realised. It starts, in usual noir fashion, with a man abruptly waking up in a strange, dingy room with a stranger phonecall heeding a warning. He has no memory of his past or identity, but is asked to be the protagonist and be on the run almost immediately. Slowly the pieces are drawn together. The film's title is quite literal. The rain-streaked streets are practically allergic to lights, except for a few briefly flickering neon lights, feebly trying to stave off the darkness. Interiors have a sickly, alien green tinge that seems to emanate from no visible source, and the walls close in claustrophobically on John Murdoch (the plot becomes one of those typical mysteries where we start with a phrase or name and slowly unravel the puzzle). And its inhabitants speak strangely, for the few that are not content to namelessly shuffle on by. The barman, or rather the hotel man, bellows profusely but others no information. He says things like 'cash on the barrelhead'. What time period are we in? We do not know, and neither does John Murdoch. The best of the science fiction films draw us in immediately, and this is what Dark City does. It pieces together familiar elements from other stories and genres, but leaves a darker trail for us to follow, one which creates unease and disillusionment at every shadowy corner. Many of us will recognise the femme fatale type with her sultry voice, serenading what is left of the nightly crowd. Connelly's eyes have a piercing beauty, although the rest of her body seems stiff, and her hips do not swing in the same way we expect them to. Is this a limitation of her performance, or simply a byproduct of living in Dark City? Murdoch does not have time to find out. He is being chased by men shrouded in dark, with pale, ivory skin and gleaming daggers. They seem only humanoid in appearance. In one of the film's most sinister moments, everyone but Murdoch falls asleep at midnight, and the buildings and walls themselves begin to shift and morph into different shapes. The effects are done with extreme care; the city becomes a massive, hulking superstructure with a mind of its own, brainwashing and altering story lines and identities, the very concrete facts that Murdoch has painlessly uncovered. It recalls the very essence of German Expressionism, and how the city is like a physical representation of Murdoch's own psyche, as twisted and unsettling as regime he has stumbled upon. The intent is very Orwellian, and like a Winston Smith, he can do nothing but watch it happen. The story is strongly reminiscent of The Matrix, which was released a year later. Both feature a special and unique individual who has the bandages over his eyes ripped off to face an eerie dystopia and an impossible task. The latter is cleverer; it made a dystopia out of an apparent utopia, fear out of perfection and clean surfaces. And the action is slicker, more precise, more orientated - it helps when you have superpowers and can call in a small army of guns. The impact of Dark City is more visceral, more immediate. It is almost certain that what lies behind the brick wall is not the sun-kissed Shell Beach, and we can feel the collective despair of the emptiness of the dark blotches of space. There's an allegorical message in there somewhere if you dig deep enough, but it's muddled within the plot. So it has to finish with spectacle, but at least it is large-scale and of the best kind.",7,1,2,2 August 2016
The Intouchables," No Pity
","Intouchables opens with a non-linear introduction of the two central characters, Philippe (François Cluzet), and Driss (Omar Sy). It's a remarkable direction to go with because it so easily and gently presents the strong bond of the pair in just a few minutes. We later come back to this scene and it slips into the narrative quite comfortably. The important thing about their on-screen relationship is that it doesn't lean on the handicap which defines the difference between them. You get a genuine sense of connection and attachment with only a few lines and that's before the wheelchair or the disability is revealed. Such is the chemistry and performance of the pair that they shine in every single scene of the film. The whole disadvantaged person comes into contact with a higher class and changes his whole life and perspective is not the most original story of course. It's an slightly altered version of the white saviour narrative; a more modern Driving Miss Daisy if you will. It's not so much a race issue; Driss' real life counterpart was not black. But it's still quite easy to distinguish the difference in class. There's a nice piece of cinematography after the open where we dolly across a row of applicants for the role of carer, seeing a blurred pallet of pant suits and leather shoes until we reach the sweatpants and worn sneakers of Driss. It doesn't get much more explicit; for most of the film his background isn't referred to that often. A hint of criminal activity there, a few insights into the cramped apartment he shares with his extended family. The hand-held cam gets whipped out for the seldom times when Driss is actually among similar demographic, but there's not much really happening. It's never even made clear why Driss has to leave and help out his family other than some sort of street-fight. Some may deride this approach as shallow. We see the extraordinary good side of Driss and not the bad side. Those criticisms have some merit but for once it is refreshing to kick back and just be entertained instead of expecting a thorough investigation into the race- relations and poverty scene of modern day France. Driss is one of the most likable characters of recent times because there are no real repercussions for his story. The screenplay does not aim to provide a start-to-end standard plot but leans heavily on their characterisation and chemistry. It's a very simply premise which we've all come to expect. Driss isn't even Tsundere from the beginning. He shows no real aspirations in life and aimslessly bounces from place to place, living on the benefit. And so Philippe makes a wager; for the person who has lived on assistance his whole life to try his own hand at assisting others. The opening scene is a very obvious endpoint of the relationship but that does not derail the set up. Omar Sy's performance is one of great laughter and passion. It doesn't take long before he warms to the whole scenario and the chemistry between him and Cluzet is palpable from the very beginning. Much of that is derived from humour; the pair manages to turn most scenes into comedic ones and their relationship is so authentic and heart- warming that their laughter becomes contagious. There's more serious conversations as well; these are fair and few between and don't overstep their boundary. There's of course a mid-film montage as Driss gets more settled in, but that comes after a large stretch of discourse time where we familiarise ourselves with him. His character is pretty distinct amongst all the other candidates (perhaps a little too distinct as evident by the horrible job the replacements do). His larger than life reactions to the high class living conditions, his amusement at every little thing, his childish attitude and caring nature. One of the most thematically important quotes of the film comes from Phillipe: 'That's exactly what I want. No pity.' It encapsulates their entire relationship as transcending the disability; Driss sees him as a friend, as an equal. It strengthens their bond so much more. There's a moment when they attend a 4 hour theatre play. The first act begins and an absurdly dressed man walks on stage, playing a tree, and starts to shriek in German. Driss takes one look at this and bursts out laughing, while moments later Phillipe starts to hold back chuckles as well, apparently recognising the ridiculousness of it all. It's so easy as a viewer to slip into either of those mindsets. Intouchables, like many other films based on true events, doesn't attempt to give any true ending or sense of closure. There's the love plot of Phillipe's epistolary relationship which attempts to once again give him that happy ending but is overshadowed quite easily by that of Driss'. It's a very authentic and genuine friendship which evolves slowly but surely, not driven by plot but a pure and deep connection. Omar Sy's captivating performance is enough to stamp out any minor flaws in the film (the painting storyline being one of them). Even recognising them, it's a very hard film to dislike.",8,0,0,12 June 2015
Ratatouille," Anyone can cook
","And a great artist can come from anywhere. It's the sort of motto only Pixar would take to mean an anthropomorphic genius cooking rat. But animation needs these types of crazy premises because there is so much potential in the medium. It's Paris, France however where Ratatouille takes place. The lover's city, one of the most beautiful in the world, and yet that famed shot of the Eiffel Tower is used sparingly to great effect. Most of this film takes place in one kitchen, that of the recently deceased Auguste Gusteau. The vibrant and lively animation from Pixar studios is on in full force here. More than a million hairs animated for the lead character of Remy the rat, but that's not even the best part of it. His character design is full of human mannerisms which add so much to the rodent voiced by Patton Oswald: shrugs, finger guns, running skids, rubbing his hands together and waving to waft in the aromas of French cuisine. Which brings me to another of the film's many strengths; the animation brings the kitchen of a world class restaurant to life. Bunches of spice, fat cloves of garlic, thick ringlets of white onion, a bubbling brimming pot of soup, crunchy clusters of grapes, huge wheels of cheese, even a simple aromatic omelette. Readers of Brian Jacques and George RR Martin know exactly the feeling. Rataouille is a mouthwatering delight equally for those microwave masters and fine dining connoisseurs. Michael Giacchino delivers an charming and delightful score that never oversteps throughout. It accelerates when it needs to; most notably in the first ascension of Remy to the surface where he creeps throughout the various floorboards and roofs of Paris, racing past fighting lovers and dinner parties and dogs to a frantic yet whimsical flute tune. He climbs higher and higher and the music swells and gently floats as he reaches the top for the first time, the bright lights of Paris and the Eiffel glittering in front of our eyes. A very beautiful scene. This sort of contrast is again seen when Remy is attempting to escape the kitchen. It's the same theme as before, only this time even faster paced, heavier and more menacing as he dodges fiery ovens and knives and gigantic boots. The orchestra builds to a climax and then abruptly switches to a pleasant strings version of 'Le Festin' as the cart breaches the boundary between dining and cooking. The sound design is particularly exceptional in this scene in creating and contrasting the frying, banging and chopping of the kitchen to the wonderful ambiance of the dining area. You could almost close your eyes and follow the themes just as easily. And of course Camille's performance of 'Le Festin' during a montage in the middle is absolutely wonderful. It's in the alluring language of French but it's not hard to decipher the meanings it conjures: of love and romance, of good food and celebration, of life as a feast to admire and devour. The voice-acting is another top notch dimension of the film. Patton Oswald is perfect as the ever inquisitive and spirited Remy. His narration is so natural and well-fitting that only a few lines seem overdone; in some revelations it's unnecessary, such is the amount of subtext and information contained in the animation of Remy's gestures and expressions. Brad Garrett's experience shines in his portrayal as the jovial and larger-than-life Gusteau, stealing every scene and figment of imagination he appears in. Ratatouille is filled with so many similarly rich characters which combine with the voice acting and animation to create a living breathing world. Lou Romano's over-exaggerated screams and stutters fit perfectly with his character design of a bumbling human marionette, flustered, clueless and over-enthusiastic yet possessing heart. And who gives a more menacing performance than veteran Peter O'Toole, as the scathing British food critic Anton Ego (probably could have come up with a better name). He lives a life of disappointment despite his love of food, bouncing from restaurant to restaurant in search of some well-seasoned perspective. He gets more than that in a blast from the past with his first mouthful of the so-called peasant dish of Ratatouille; a loud rush of nostalgia as we flash back to his childhood, a modest hut bathed in the warm afternoon soon, filled with an ethereal glow, a boy tucking in to a homely afternoon meal. Even without the slow motion drop of the pen we know exactly what Ego is experiencing. His face creases up in delight. There's not even a word to describe it: just an audible mmmmhm from a mouth used to spitting out harsh criticism. Even Skinner at the other table can't hold it back when he tastes the dish. It's an extremely evocative and poignant scene that sits up there with Pixar's best.There's no need for O'Toole's voice-over in that moment; in fact it might have diminished it's significance. It's later heard in a voice-over of his review of that meal. It's the perfect bookend to a film about new expectations and ambitions. Remy's humble origins don't hold him back from attaining greatness in the face of a city that mostly disdains pests like him. It's not the most complicated plot but it's one that is lifted from the simple framework of a young character aspiring to be more into a lavish and memorable story about an unlikely genius. The screenplay is simple yet almost never bloated (the romantic angle being one slightly forced arc). The animation, voice-acting and score all play their part in this heart-warming film which, like Ego, leaves you hungry for more.",9,0,1,14 June 2015
Aliens," It won't make a difference.
","Aliens is in many a carbon copy of the action thriller that was Alien - in which the lone feminist Ripley goes beyond her means to beat down the enemies and go through a personal growth. There is the same time limit which blares through the action to remind us of the impending doom. The same company interfering moral boundaries for their own financial gain. And there is the second chance for the Alien to strike back - they are never truly safe on these spaceships. Interestingly enough although Cameron builds much on the world that Scott created with a larger wealth of secondary characters and regulations and jurisdictions, but is wise enough to remain in the gritty, mysterious final frontier. No doubt Earth by now is either a desolate wasteland or glittering utopia - but the story does not need the contrast. There is a peculiar shot that sums it all up - the despondent Ripley waiting for any news about the current timeline, sitting on a bench within some trees, and then the camera swings around and reveals the background as a phony, two dimensional projection. But apart from a similar plot structure Cameron has improved on the predecessor in many ways. Technically, the difference is obvious. The practical puppetry involved with the gigantic alien queen and the exosuit cargo loaders is brilliant; they move seamlessly and with a life of their own. The corrupted industrial setting is perfect for the battle for territory - Biddle's job is made easy with the pitch darkness only split by the glaring flood lights of the marines. A really great decision to use that singular natural light source to ramp up the anxiety of each shadowy corner and archway; elsewhere there are little touches like a giant fan to chop up the flickering lights. The smoke and dust is atmospheric whilst also masking the budgetary and limitations; we never know what's around the corner (or up above). And who can forget that dripping, slimy translucent tunnel feeding the queen? A secondary effect of the technical improvement is to clearly show how outclassed the humans still are after 57 years. The marines are predictable enough, and verging on cliché. The Vietnam parallels are clear; go in with a lot of firepower and not much sense, and be overwhelmed and out of their element. Paxton is the only one who really oversells it - overconfident initially and then a hammy, hokey coward. But can you blame him? The crew in Aliens had at least spacesuits (which were nevertheless violated). These soldiers have thin vests and some not even gloves. Here we have a clear, well defined arc for Ripley. There is noticeably more maternal subtext than previously; the appearance of Newt drives her development from traumatised to level-headed and intelligent, and the protective motherly instinct mirrored by the nest queen itself seeing its eggs set on fire. A scene from the director's cut actually gives it even more meaning, where we find out the fate of Ripley's young daughter, having passed away in her middle age only 2 years before. So through her redemption she gains a second chance with Newt. The story comes full circle.",9,0,1,18 April 2016
Duck You Sucker," Duck, you sucker!
","This is not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. Instead of a nameless stranger wandering into some town in the west and gunning away all his problems, we open on a naive Mexican peeing into the ground and playing his dumbstruck role quite well. We can tell by the way the camera focuses in extreme close-up on the beady eyes and mouths sloppily consuming food of the high class passengers of the carriage that Juan is fiercely envious and furious at the state of affairs. And their dialogue confirms it too, mocking and racist, and he is forced to goofily play along so he can take his revenge. Later on, he has a passionate monologue about his distastes for revolutionaries and the thinly veiled false promises they deliver, but somehow gets swept up in one anyway. It is unusual for Leone to be political; one might suggest that he finds a common view in Sean Mallory, the jaded, cynical Irishman who has experienced betrayal in his homeland and wants to create change elsewhere. The events bring these two unlikely characters together. There are arguably more visual flourishes than ever before. Leone has always let his images tell the story; it helps when your main characters talks more with his gun and hat then with his clipped, minimalistic dialogue. This is more of the same. There is that infamous moment where Juan connects the dots and sees the criminal potential in Sean's explosives expertise, and Leone highlights this with a cartoonish, flashing banner above his head like a casino neon sign screaming 'Jackpot'. When he first arrives at the famed Mesa Verde National Bank, his eyes light up and Morricone adds this dramatic organ piece that seems fit for a lavish cathedral. It is as if the riches that lay waiting inside attain an almost religious type of love and desire - he wrings his hands like a giddy child discovering a stash of candy. And Leone as always loves his zoom in closeups - he lets his actors freely emote, especially in the eyes - there's that great shot of Juan peering out from the slit in the poster, with a premonition of his future choices. But as they get deeper and deeper into the revolution, it becomes clear that things are not what they seem, and their choices have morphed into bigger and more dangerous consequences. After a thrilling large- scale action sequence that involved blowing up an actual bridge, they return to find their families and comrades slaughtered and there is this long, moody period where the characters are silently grieving. Early Leone would not find the time for this. There is also Sean's flashbacks which have a hazy, dreamlike quality - they litter the film throughout and continually haunt his memories (perhaps at times lingering a tad too long), whereas previously they had been mostly a technique used to boost the intensity of the climatic encounter. In one moment, they hit Sean with such startling potency that the edits hammer into him like the rattle of a machine gun. And there is darkness and edge to their actions that seems so far removed from the sun-baked plains of the western; a grim execution by firing squad in the rainy night that reminds me of Goya's The Third of May 1808, while our pair watches from afar. This sort of helplessness is something that Leone had not always considered for his heroes (or at least, anti-heroes). Eastwood had carried with him an air of coolness and invincibility. It certainly is stylish and a lot of fun. We chuckle along every time Sean walks away with a swagger and utters those titular lines. Morricone's soundtrack is walking the same walk - there is no twisting flute or cacophony of whistles to accompany that lone figure on the plains. The heavy bass-line of 'Invention of John' over the opening credits seems to be constantly building towards a climax, like a cowboy strutting his step. He isn't afraid to juxtapose mass murder with these stirring strings - it is a victory, but at what cost, and for what gain? As I watched this, I was asked by a young friend whether they were the good guys or the bad guys. It seems to be a moral quandary that never really is broached. Is revolution stylish and elegant, or is it a brutal act of violence? Can we blame Juan for getting so caught up in these events, just after he rants about the impossibilities of revolution? Maybe he should have ducked and not let his sense of responsibility get the better of him, else he finds himself an unanswerable question at the end of the film.",8,1,1,23 February 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," I didn't even know there was good music until like two months ago!
","The extent of the comic book influence in Ang Lee's Hulk were lines intersecting and dividing the frame into panels just like the source material would. Not exactly a novel or inspired idea, and it added exactly zero to an already mediocre film. Scott Pilgrim is another one of those rare occasions where merely adapting a comic's story is not enough; the essence of comic books and their unique elements must be integrated into the film itself. Are these decisions fully justified? Many of the effects, while pretty and neat, don't contribute a whole lot, but are there to satiate the fans of the source material and those familiar with comic book tropes; flashy visualisations of sound effects (the crash bangs, bells ringing, bass notes), presenting conversations by splitting the frame instead of your conventional shot reverse shot, text boxes with introductory information, and so on. There are a few instances of Wright's innovation with these elements - a powered up Todd demonstrating his strength by smashing Scott through the panel's barrier comes to mind. But most of it is just unnecessary nonsense. The film also lifts liberally from video-game mechanics. The plot itself is positioned like a game's plot; seven exes, or bosses, each with their own special abilities and backstories, needing to be defeated to gain the final prize. The action sequences are delightfully exaggerated as they would be if you were controlling Scott as the protagonist and hero; appropriately timed speed ramping, flashy power-up effects, the aspect ratio shrinking and enlarging to capture the intensity of a critical hit. But to what extent do flashy effects cover up the lacklustre narrative that indulges them? I guess it's cool to add a glowing sword and tell us Scott's stat increases at a crucial part of his growth; he gains the powers of love, and then later self-respect. What this does, however, is make his characterisation almost entirely reliant on these gimmicks and prevent the film from truly getting to the heart of its characters and motivations. Could you ever imagine Citizen Kane with a little bar at the bottom of the screen that indicated Kane's level of regret?What Wright does is cover almost every facet of his film with a visual gimmick or effect so that the actual characters are scarcely allowed to breathe. Much of the humour comes from the script rather than the characters; when Scott breathlessly indicates his willingness to do 'all of the drugs' to impress Ramona, all it sounds like is an actor reciting a line. Cera taps into his usual persona; the quiet, unassuming teenager who speaks almost exclusively in deadpan, so it seems baffling that so many girls could ever be attracted to him. The same applies to Ramona Flowers, the self-described Manic Pixie Dream Girl: she claims 'I change my hair every week and a half, dude. Get used to it.' as if this is a substitute for an actual personality. Winstead is pretty and has an air of vague vulnerability to her, but Ramona is nothing more than an airy plot device to serve Scott's coming-of-age story. The worst offender is the seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl named 'Knives Chau', who speaks and acts like she has jumped straight out of a nerd's wet-dream. Wong does a brilliant job, nevertheless - Knives is ever smiling, bouncing and on Scott's arm, like a girlfriend created in a lab (or a video-game), and conveniently does not ever seem to notice or address any of his flaws. In the end, she is tossed aside for the happy hopeful ending, and the film cares more about their synchronised jump-kicks than Scott's quick apology. This is the crux of the film's problem; there is clearly an arc written for Scott's redemption, to realise the error of his ways, his selfishness and the self-doubt that comes with the constant comparison and clashing with Ramona's exes. But it is all hidden under intentional silliness and camp, and when we try to closely scrutinise his actions, they don't make any sense. Scott finally gains enough self-respect to stop measuring himself next to the exes, and meaninglessly chase a pretty enigma. But it turns out that his dickishness didn't have any consequences at all; Knives is still the bouncing stereotype that is more than happy to endorse the dream pair, and Ramona is there to welcome him with open arms. It goes for the cool ending, instead of one bound by common sense.",6,3,5,15 July 2016
Inside Out," Emotional manifestations are just like imaginary boyfriends from Canada
","The first Inside Out trailer didn't impress me all that much. It showcased some typical character stereotypes; the unresponsive moody teenager, the sports-obsessed, distracted and distant dad, the romance reminiscing mum. 2 of these still remain in the film, but that trailer omits some crucial bits of interaction inside Riley's brain, now missing they key elements of Joy, and to a lesser extent, Sadness. The character design of the five emotions isn't the most innovative. Anger is bright red and spews fire when furious. Sadness is droopy and depressingly blue. Disgust is a nauseous shade of green. The brilliance is however from the casting of the voice actors which lends some much needed nuance and expression to the pivotal characters. In particular Lewis Black as the ever exasperated and highly tense Anger who regularly loses control and pushes Riley into action. The star is of course Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler as the ever bubbly point of optimism and the command of Riley's brain. Joy starts off as a very positive and over-eager character, if not a little pushy, but Poehler displays a wider emotional range as the film progresses. A subtle symbol of maturity shows up in the more orderly and cooperative emotions of the parents at their control panels. One might see these as evolutions into empathy and fairness respectively. Some have expressed unsatisfactory concerns at the overall execution of the concept itself. After all, it's not the most original concept: the sitcom Herman's Head, the comic strip The Numbskulls, Osmosis Jones... Some have even remarked that it is surprisingly mechanical for a Pixar film; it feels less like Riley reacting to the real world and more just simplistic caricatures pushing buttons and her responding to them. There's an alternate interpretation that I can offer in that it actually is the other way around. Sadness isn't just an annoying character looking to push buttons (literally and figuratively) and cause trouble for Riley; rather it's Riley missing home and hockey and friends as a natural reaction that causes Sadness to act up and this manifests in her actions in messing with the core memories. Maybe satisfying for some, but it does slightly undercut the fantastic execution of the concept of the emotions when Joy and Sadness leave in the dinner scene, where Disgust, Fear and Anger try to mimic Joy in a very effective and organic manifestation of a moody teenager that fits in with the narrative. Disgust becomes sarcasm, Fear becomes denial, and Anger becomes passive aggression. Most will start off hating Sadness, the negative emotion who always seems to find herself in the wrong place and wreak havoc in Riley's brain. It's a legitimate complaint, especially coupled with Joy's insistence on being the command and delegating Sadness to a corner (there's a suggestion here of Riley repressing her Sadness). It's with such ease that the screenplay manages to reverse this and change our opinions of her throughout the film. When Joy relinquishes command to Sadness in the climax where Riley returns home, I fully expected Sadness to formulate empathy and realisation of the effects of what running away from home would do to her parents. Anguish and grief and depression that she could relate to, going through the same herself. What I got instead was a much more natural and organic scene. There's no plot twist or flashback or passionate drive that Riley goes through; it's refreshing to let a character break down and be emotionally overwhelmed as a girl her age often would in such a scenario. It's a gentle and poignant reminder that it's okay and important to sometimes let it out and be sad. Recognising and making mistakes like Riley does paves the way for newer, more complex memories. Inside Out's humour is strong, although that is in itself subjective. There's a wealth of details within the concept that lend itself to funny scenes, like the maintenance workers deleting useless information (Save Chopsticks and Heart & Soul, forget the rest), the mix-up between facts and opinions, the repeating chewing gum commercial. There's also plenty of more obscure material and references that adults might spot (Forget it Jake, it's Cloudtown). And how about the five Angers that reside permanently in the bus driver's head?Michael Giacchino returns for his fifth Pixar collaboration after wonderful scores such as those from Ratatouille, The Incredibles and Up. 'Married Life' is an extremely elegant and emotionally poignant few minutes of Pixar history. His Inside out composition is equally brilliant. The main theme, 'Bundle of Joy' highlights a simple piano riff that basks in its ambiance and constantly switches from major to minor keys, contrasting the beauty of joy and sadness. Giacchino excels in those quiet emotionally significant moments, the best of these being the melodic night sequence where Joy ice-skates along with Riley in her dreams. Inside Out once again demonstrates Pixar's mastery in handling emotionally dense material even in a relatively kid-friendly environment where the line between juvenile and heavy adulthood is hard to toe. It balances humour with dramatic stakes for very real and complex characters. When Joy and Sadness rush to prevent Riley from falling into depression (failing to feel any emotion at all), it's tense and makes for an even more emotionally draining and important scene when they are finally released in her tears. This is Pixar at its most emotionally resonant.",9,5,24,29 June 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," He was growing into middle age, and was living then in a bungalow on Woodland Avenue.
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of those works of art that betray their plot details in their own title. It's a tricky thing to pull off, but in this instance it is an integral element in viewing the film. The title itself, and the words of the source material have become legend, and legend is often mistaken for fact. The narrator speaks with an air of authority as if he were talking in a documentary, recording history as it happened with an eye for objectivity. Roger Deakins stacks lenses on top of each other and blurs the edges of the frame in crucial moments, mimicking the deterioration of older photographs taken with the collodion process, or if you want to go further back, a scrap of parchment, its edges being burnt away along with the story it tells. It creates the feeling of a faded, aged narrative that is being passed down in history - and like so many stories, it has been shaped and morphed by each mouth and each stroke of the pen, until it becomes an entirely different account. So to call what occurs an assassination would be an exaggeration to say the least; that implies a meticulous and calculated affair rather than the sudden gunshot that shocks the housewife in the other room. It certainly has a tinge of romanticism to it, and feels like something that Jesse James has concocted in his slow descent into paranoia and madness - to feel so mighty of himself that he must not merely be shot in the head, but accounted and taken care of via a precise assassination. Why else would he attempt to desperately stage something so dramatic and theatrical in his last moments, as he stares into the reflection of his soon to be killer? This is Pitt at his best; increasingly ragged and spent, like a powerful lion past its prime and mane and muscles fading. His bursts of anger and obsession only thinly disguise what everyone knows; that sooner or later his notoriety will get the better of him, and even loyalty or admiration (from his biggest fan, no less) will not be an obstacle on that day. And through his efforts, that killer is branded a coward. His name is Robert Ford, and he has idolised the legend ever since he was a kid. Casey Affleck is more than competent; in a moment of starstruck admiration, James admits that the stories are embellished at best and lies at worst, and his world is momentarily shattered - but of course to win his affection he composes himself and hastily laughs it off. But it is a crucial blow, because he slowly discovers the myths surrounding figures such as James, and how they can be much more invincible than the person themselves. In another vulnerable moment, he is jeered at and threatened by senior members of the gang, and attempts to establish his own aura of intimidation, but instead his voice just slightly cracks, betraying his youth. This is just as false as his later cockiness and new-found confidence after what is presumably his first ever kill. Meanwhile, he resumes his obsession with the outlaw Jesse James, and tries to construct his own legend...ah, but these forces are beyond his control. Deakins' work has been praised again and again - his vignetted frames force a focus unlike any other. A conversation between a man and Jesse James becomes fiercely surveyed by Robert, in dead centre. A weathered outlaw, once the brightest of lights, is silhouetted by a fading sunset. He makes the landscapes barren and harsh, rivalling the very power of Malick's Days of Heaven. A key scene involving the robbery of a train is often mentioned. It is a short but chilling sequence, heightened by the lack of light but for the one swinging lamp of Jesse James and the beam of the train itself, unknowingly casting strands of light among the trees where the haunting, ghostly figures lie. It would be nothing without Ellis and Cave's score; the mournful strings slowly but surely ushering the innocents into the gang's out-stretched hands. They return again and again to that thudding baseline, like a heartbeat painfully reaching for another moment of life, and that fairytale-like piece in 'Song for Jesse' with its twinkling xylophone that together with the narration makes it feel as if a storybook was being unveiled to us, page by page. As he drowns his face in cold water and prepares to kill his idol, a shrill, siren-like sound effect permeates Robert's mind, and he can barely focus on the conversation (she asks him his portion size, but almost anything feels like an accusation at this point, as his guilt builds) at hand.And yet, it doesn't feel complete. For all the thematic focus on the morphing of myth and the twisting of tales by word of mouth and legend, in the end it is the narrator who does most of this heavy lifting as he elaborates on the coward's subsequent downfall. Eloquent as it is, it often takes whole paragraphs out of Hansen's novel, and this has an overpowering effect. The few scenes post-assassination flicker past the branding of his shame, when they should linger. Eight hundred performances, once agonising, as the ghost of Jesse James taunts Robert at failing in becoming his successor, flashes by in a single moment, ironically taming its emotional potency. A cameo from Zooey Deschanel attempts to uncover new ground, but is futile. This area is curiously unexplored, almost like a tacked on denouement. But then again, don't all rumours and legends originate from a blurred, indistinct source?",8,0,0,24 February 2016
Before Sunset," Why didn't they ask me to marry them? I would've said no, but at least they could have asked.
","In Before Sunrise they were young twenty somethings who had not yet truly found 'the one', and through one night, experienced something fleeting and magical that almost seemed to fill that missing piece of the puzzle. They were strangers and there was nothing tricky or hidden to be surveyed, and their emotional baggage was light; it was a straightforward meet cute. Initially it seems to be again one of those chance encounters that happens only in movies. We are under the impression that Jesse is over the moon to once again see Celine, and that she also wants the chance to make up for not being there at the train station. They fall into the same conversational rhythms that seem so familiar, and then slowly, Linklater reveals their new lives.9 years ago they were relatively unbroken, and innocent, and unburdened by life. And it was a truly magical moment too, but it was just that; a moment, constricted by time. Here, they are again constricted, but not in the same way, and they know it too; Jesse extends and extends the encounter beyond what they initially agree to, a coffee, and desperately grabs at any chance to rekindle that moment and feeling - he will not again leave her on that platform. In the back of their minds, obstructions linger: a broken marriage, a long distance boyfriend, career aspirations that are miles apart. Jesse has not forgotten. In fact, he reveals, he has thought on it at just about any spare moment, and daringly, right before his wedding (this seems to be a rather careful treading of the waters, testing how receptive Celine will be). It is not immediately evident, but we notice (shots of the last encounter run through Jesse's mind as he dodges reporter's questions). The dialogue is timid and tentative, and hesitant of the topic on the audience's minds; they update each other on their lives, and seem to take an eternity to broach the all important question of relationship status. It is masterful how Linklater sets up their defenses - well Celine's, because Jesse is all but spilling by about halfway through. She acts forgetful; did they have sex, or didn't they? Where exactly did they visit again? Meanwhile Jesse puts on a cynical, jaded mask, and as they muse on the world's affairs, he criticises the modern sense of entitlement, but we and Celine see right through this; he is almost begging for another Vienna. When she jokingly proposes a scenario, he brushes clean a park bench and eagerly throws her onto his lap. That would have worked 9 years ago. They muse that maybe they are only good at the brief encounters, the ones that seem to last a small eternity in the romance novels and movies. Jesse throws his head into his hands in regret, and glances sidewards to see if Celine has the same reaction. She does not betray it easily. He remembers every crystal clear detail of his memory, including thinking of her as he walks into a deli with an umbrella on his wedding day, and she counters that she lived only two streets away, as if she is slowly beginning to feel it too. And then she cracks in the car, and reveals that she too has been dwelling on it endlessly, and that she is just as vulnerable, and we begin to understand how that one night has shaped their romantic expectations ever since. She has written a song about it, performed so tenderly by Delphy, and though she jokes that she inserts different names into it depending on whom she is wooing, we know the truth. Before Sunset asks more questions of Jesse and Celine. It offers the same feeling, and the same love, but now they are older, more cumbersome, and juggling real life obstacles that make a dreamy night in Vienna no longer possible. And yet, there is still something between them. At first, they put on a pretense that they have their lives together, and that they are not bothered by the missed opportunity. Then they confess this is not the case. And then slowly but gradually, in the same space of time as before, they fall for each other again. 'Baby, you are gonna miss that plane', she croons, and Jesse responds that he knows. And we all know it too.",10,1,2,2 January 2016
The Princess Bride," The chocolate coating makes it go down easier
","The Princess Bride is framed by a second narrative of a grandpa telling a story to his sick grandchild, who like all pre-teen boys wants to listen to things like sports and fighting, not true love and kisses. Of course in the end he changes his mind, having being enthralled by the story like so many others. It's a very neat device which allows the film some breathing space; clichés, larger than life characters with seemingly singular purposes, fantastic declarations of true love and sacrifice, mysterious locations that challenge then are never returned to...it can be all chalked up to the fairytale nature of it. And that's perhaps a crucial selling point that may make or break an impression of the cult classic; it's simply something that you either love or hate. A relieving thing about The Princess Bride is that it never takes itself too seriously. Buttercup (Robin Wright) is by far the most serious and passionate of the cast; even the enigmatic Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) has moments of playfulness and humour. When Buttercup's desperate cries of suicide rather than be wedded to a man she does not love, the film simply takes it down a notch. The protagonists are never confronted with too difficult a challenge or too perilous a situation, and if they are in a spot, there's always some sort of device or miracle to lift them out of it. Although the main romantic storyline and the tale of revenge are indeed cliché to a degree, there's also moments where Princess Bride can step back and subvert those fairytale moments. The castle's gatekeeper straight forwardly refuses to give up the key to the gates and looks to be up for a fight, before a threat of missing limbs from no less than Andre the Giant very quickly makes him fold and surrender, in a cowardly but humorous manner. The main villain Humperdinck is persuaded to surrender after an impassionate and fierce condemnation from the lowly diamond in a rough protagonist, Westley. Only after he is tied up then it is revealed that Westley can barely move a muscle, and Humperdinck bursts out in exasperation 'I knew it, I knew you were bluffing!' The important thing is that Princess Bride never descends into the areas of parody or self-awareness for the sake of it, like so many modern comedies tend to feel the need to. It relies on its sharp script and lively performances to generate humour rather than the audience nodding in recognition. There are perhaps areas of weakness that may result in the audience second guessing the narrative tone and wondering whether its camp for the sake of it or simply bad. There's a well done scene where Buttercup flings herself into the waters and is faced with Shrieking Eels (although the darkness and obscurity certainly help mask ageing effects), where the score turns ominous and we cut from a terrifying Jaws-esque display of teeth to a concerned young boy who hastily pretends to not care. There's the hilarious squabbles of heavily made-up apothecary couple Billy Crsytal and Carol Kane. And of course there's the classic confrontation between Inigo and Westley, where the duel for several minutes with both hands, flipping and jumping and dodging all around the rocky set. These scenes are weakened somewhat by others like the painfully clunky scene where Westley and Buttercup are attacked by a Rodent of Unusual Size (or just an actor in a very poorly made costume). In fact the entirety of the Fire Swamp seems rather trivial and undeveloped as a location/set (even its name screams lazy). It's of course fairly easy to push these scenes aside or convince yourself that they fit within the context of a grandpa telling a young boy a fairytale, and I suggest that you do so for maximum enjoyment. To put yourself in the shoes of the genuine innocence of the grandson will produce nothing but pure joy and magic.",8,0,0,1 August 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Take your hands off my lobby boy!
","First of all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is quintessential Wes Anderson. It's perhaps his most crisp film yet, and his most gorgeous one. There's the Anderson-esque matter-of-fact humour ('Did he just throw my cat out the window?'), and his alumni make their cameos as usual. The production design and costuming are exquisite, right down to the elegant chapter cards. New technical achievements are evident; the miniature models of the grand pink hotel itself, the snowy trees, the observatory, the diagonal tram all contribute to the dollhouse aesthetic that Anderson has carefully manufactured before, but here it is in even bigger scale. Yeoman's colour palette is again lush, ranging from the ornate warm interiors of the lobby, baby pink walls and bright red carpets, the cold browns of the other mansion of Swinton's recently deceased character, the harsh blue tint of the snowy exterior. What about the contrast of the blue and the orange merry-go-round before that gorgeous shallow focus bokeh shot of Agatha? It absolutely personifies young love. Yeoman's planimetric approach is again visible, and so we get symmetrical close ups that double as POVs like that Agatha one, or the conversation between Gustave and a dying Madame D, promoting an odd sense of intimacy. The first train interrogation scene is particularly well edited with a sense symmetry and space, with only sparse master shot coverage. The storytelling device of the multiple timelines is visualised through several aspects ratios, the most prominent of them in Academy, or 1.375:1, and this serves the composition when Anderson can push the characters together and assemble them in layers like a family portrait. Like that penultimate shot of the group in the submarine in Life Aquatic, Budapest has a few examples of this; Norton's Henckels poking his head through the ground to address his men, the various compositions in the bright red elevator, the hug amidst mountains of pink Mendl's boxes. Like Yeoman's past work with Anderson, the camera rarely moves, capturing a scene dead on then letting characters walk or poke their heads in, adding to that painterly effect. Zero emerges from Agatha's trapdoor, exiting and re-entering the frame on the next roof with a cartoon-syle sense of movement and efficiency. But when the camera does move, it adds much energy, like the bustling way we follow Gustave through the hotel lobby, designating tasks here and there, all while interviewing the new hire. It's a effective debut for the two leads; Gustave asks why Zero would want such a miserly job, and he responds 'Well, who wouldn't - at the Grand Budapest, sir. It's an institution.' Fiennes shows the first sign of interest here, but still hiding behind that facade of the meticulous concierge. 'Very good.' And I tend to agree. Desplat's score here is sublime, not sweeping or grandiose but some of his best work in creating a whimsical but wistful mood for such a heavy contextual premise. It's an American film, and mostly an American production and mixed British cast, but Desplat's orchestrations reflect the context with its Russian Folk influence that utilises a whole range of more traditional instruments such as the balalaika, the mandolin and the cimbalom. The score is lively appropriately, combining percussion and choir with the miniature play-like aesthetic of the snow chase, and Mr Moustafa and Gustave's piano/strings themes are stirring and nostalgic. But the tour de force has to be the opening theme, a heartfelt two part harmony Appenzell yodel 's'Rothe-Zäuerli' from Swiss folk group Öse Schuppel. Budapest's narrative is delivered through a several layers of time and therefore nostalgia is deeply rooted within the story, twisting and morphing it. Several moustached Stefan Zweig type characters reflect his influence on Anderson's creative process; the yearning nostalgic pasts of Gustave and an older Zero, the fascination and careful listening of Jude Law which is reminiscent of some of Zweig's work himself (Beware the Pity). Most attempts at philosophical musings or recitation of poetry from the seemingly cultured Gustave are abruptly interrupted for humour or profanity. Or perhaps that's just a reflection of the more inner persona that hides behind the concierge. We seldom are allowed a peek under that facade, but Zero throughout the journey is offered a rare opportunity. The contrast between the first and last train interrogation is insightful; Gustave is indignant and protective in both, but the second time around the sense of partnership is strengthened so much that we already know what Fiennes is about to declare. It's shot in black and white, and so the war and reality robs the story of its innocence. Is it romanticisation in Zero's retelling of the story, as he canonises Gustave as a man of great courage and kindness? Whichever conclusion, Fiennes' performance is one of a kind, dignified but intimate with time. There's definitely interference when the tale reaches Agatha's role; the lights dimmer and cast theatrical shadows over F. Murray Abraham's tear streaked face, a cinematic touch that can in turn be attributed to Wilkinson's retelling. We view Agatha from a distance; she is a door barred from entry, its memories too painful to be unlocked by the elderly Zero. Agatha's fate is addressed with a few tender lines, Gustave just six solemn words to end the tale. Why does an elderly Zero choose to approach a young writer and share his story? Perhaps he means to illustrate that men like Gustave cannot be allowed to die out, even if the retelling is at times coated with a romanticised nostalgia or insincere humour? Perhaps he is like his own self described 'faint glimmer of civilisation in that barbaric slaughterhouse once know as humanity'? Or should we choose to include the 'f*ck it'? Gustave liberally applied a perfume to his life, with only one certain lobby-boy able to penetrate that illusion and pass on his story. As Matt Zoller Zeitz eloquently states, 'life destroys, art preserves'. And what a piece of art The Grand Budapest Hotel is.",9,0,1,7 September 2015
Revolutionary Road," You were swell.
","In speaking of his classic novel Revolutionary Road, Richary Yates sees it as an indictment of 50s America clinging onto the modest living that would see so many families safely through the middle class years, not lavishly but comfortably enough. He is on the Wheelers' side of things, and even as he punishes them he sympathises and looks harshly on the neighbours who would immediately be trash-talking the moment their back is turned. When I first read the novel I was much younger and as such very taken by the Wheelers' attempted flight into the sun. Conformity is the mortal enemy of youth, and naturally I too was cheering alongside the pair as they tried desperately to escape the suburban prison that stifled them. But now, years on, I recognise that the story is more complex than that. In showing how glum the middle-class existence is Yates (however intentionally or not) also reveals how very broken and flawed Frank and April are. The couple have internalised a quarter-life of misery, regret and missed opportunities so thoroughly that they clutch blindly at the first chance of a change, no matter how little they have thought of the risks and responsibilities they are leaving behind. Like that first sexual encounter they revel in the brief fervour of the decision, and when that breaks down, foolishly and falsely in empty affairs. At least some of this has survived the tricky process of adaptation in Sam Mendes' film. Unlike the similar American Beauty, which had the camera caress and lavish the open spaces and spotless canvases of the more prosperous 90s, in Revolutionary Road the walls should compress and close in on the Wheelers. The compositions are sharp all the same, but not inspired. Mendes can't recreate the subtext of the novel in any other way except through flashy and shouty dialogue, which merely simplifies the entire struggle of the family. He has cut the suffocating hum-drum of the Shep and Millie dinners, and missed a vital opportunity to showcase how the environment reinforces the behaviour of the inhabitants of Revolutionary Road and any other street, lane, drive or alley of Connecticut. Mendes has no patience. Instead of allocating time for this to build up to almost agonising levels, he takes the lazy and novel route: flashbacks. This is the fatal flaw of the film, to assign different versions of Frank and April Wheeler and try to rope us in with false visions of regret. The opening is warm and cosy, the two glamorous leads meet cute and are instantly blubbering on about their various dreams and aspirations (and later whistle and frolic on the lawn after their big decision). And then throughout the film we pull back to when they were younger and feistier and had ambition they can barely recall today. This of course goes against everything that Yates stood for - he wanted the Wheelers to break free from the monotonous conformity of their surroundings, not be designated as special, shiny snowflakes that are held back by those around them. What this results in is the film going down entirely the wrong path, wherein the fault is not within themselves but rather a vague aspect of luck and destiny dealing them a less than completely satisfactory card that eradicates their potential. Mendes can't even delivery fully on that front; the film strains to convince us that Frank is really the 'fine mind' that has been wasted in corporate, although this may just be a delusion of April's. Winslet is more than capable of playing such a frightened and boxed- in mother and wife; her body is in an ever-bowed position, fretting and rising just enough to put on a weak smile, all the while hiding her quiet desperation and intentions behind it. It is unfortunate that the editing lays her out to dry by needlessly forcing comparison with the past version of April, the graceful and straight-postured aspiring actress. DiCaprio explodes externally as necessary, although the writing betrays his character by portraying his affair as something borne of his natural charm and debonair (we've seen this before, in Catch Me If You Can, Wolf of Wall Street, and so on) rather than an inevitability of the setting. And Michael Shannon is a fine actor wasted in a hokey role (or dramatic device) that bears the ridiculous implication that only the disabled could see through the farce of the suburban American dream, although Yates must bear some of this blame for this. If there is an inspired moment of change it is something that does not happen until we are well acquainted with Frank and April Wheeler. After a big fight they run off to their respective corners; April the home and Frank the hotel room. It is only after Frank stumbles into that kitchen that I remembered they had two little girls also living with them; so magnified is their desperation and their insecurities within their egos that it effectively pushes their daughters out of the picture. The moment is such a damning reveal of their selfishness, and the lengths of their blind devotion to the Paris dream that all other responsibilities, most importantly parental, are completely forgotten.",6,0,0,28 September 2016
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wo hu cang long
","The action of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon comes fast and thick. It is under the direction of the master Yeun Wo Ping that they are staged, in the manner of the old Wu Xia novels that have entranced generations. The fighters float effortlessly and gracefully over rooftops and across crevices. They fling objects like they weigh nothing at all and their bodies are powered by a strange, otherworldly power. They cartwheel off walls with an accelerated elegance and ease (though the footage does seems sped up). They have names like Iron Arm and Southern Crane, and carry their signature weapons and tools with pride. Some detractors might express the opinion that this depiction of martial arts seems fetishsised and catered primarily to a Western audience. But the movie does not just exist to serve the action - the narrative is the stuff of legends and fable. It starts with a legendary sword, as always. Li Mu Bai is played by action royalty Chow Yun-fat as a dedicated Wudang swordsman whom has given his life for his art. His performance is dignified and composed as his swordplay is (see how he matches Jen stroke for stroke with a sheathed Green Destiny, and then as he unsheathes it, there is a ringing and shimmering gleam that signals his true mastery of the blade), but there is an undercurrent of weariness and desire for a quieter, more normal life. There is an underlying romance with fellow fighter Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) that is expressed not through words, but longing looks. And there is revenge, and loyalty, and honour, ideas that are found within the roots of Chinese imperialism periods. We understand that after her escape and subsequent crimes, that Jen Yu will no longer be able to face her parents for the shame she has brought to her family name. It is Zhang Ziyi that is the star here. She is one of those actresses that seems to have an eternal youthful vivacity about her, even in her more recent films. This was her breakout film and she excels; there's an element of roguish rascalism that reflects her age, and which contributes much to her disobedient character. Her fighting skill allows her this type of arrogance, along with a dismissive tone to her speech that suggests experience but which does not match her youthful face. This is to be expected; she seizes power and turns on her elders, and in a moment of perfect characterisation, jumps after the legendary Green Destiny because the loss of it would represent a license to do whatever she please and beat whomever she turned its blade on. And there is no usual redemption for her here; in a poetic twist, her surrender to the gods of fate and judgement highlights a new vulnerability and acceptance of her actions. It is open-ended, but in the best way, as if beckoning us to make our own conclusion on her heat's purity, and it feels like a fully realised and fulfilled arc (although it loses points for the over-long flashback sequence that almost makes us forget the main storyline). But most of all it is the action that excites and pleases. There is the classic one master against hundreds, and Lee manages to tread the fine line between comic and dramatic and as such the goofiness and B-action-esque of the Qinggong style become thrilling and captivating. There's a nice little moment of vulnerability where Jen clutches her wrist after repelling the first challenger, as if studying the book for years does not equate to mastery in reality. And then she draws Green Destiny and proceeds to beat them all soundly. There's a brilliant awareness of the surroundings, not just as eye candy, but as an element of the action itself - Jackie Chan is another who knows this. Lee knows he can cut to a man being flung out of the window, smashing much more of the building than necessary in order to provide comic relief - and then to use the same method in the delay of the collapse of the floor in the final wide shot, after a brief lull as Jen dispatches the last combatants. But the best of them all must be the showdown between Jen and Yu Shu Lien. It seems very convenient for them to drop into what is basically a square weapons playground, but the action switches into overdrive and we soon forget this. What makes this more than just a flashy fight scene is the emotional undercurrent that charges both of them; past the polite pleasantries, the faux declaration of sisterhood, and the betrayal and bloodshed Jen has brought upon the area all ring in their minds, and it isn't just a showy clash of techniques, but a deadly dance. The percussion slowly builds in intensity, and their blows become more frantic, and less guarded. It is masterfully shot and choreographed - we see fluid full body movement and acrobatics that defy physics. And Lee will use choice closeups to indicate moments of turning of the tide; a thick iron bar with deep gashes to show the Green Destiny's wicked edge, and the shaking, inexperienced, young hand that clutches it. How could this be any less thrilling?",9,0,1,2 March 2016
Mr. Nobody," Zugzwang
","So the big plot twist in Mr Nobody is that all of these timelines, even the one in the future where an elderly Nemo is being interviewed by a confused British journalist, are all figments of the imagination of a little boy. He is stuck between a choice that will presumably fling his life into two directions: stay with dad, or go with mum. In one of his theorised timelines, he is a television presenter, and this is a convenient way for Van Dormael to introduce all the buzz words and clue the viewer in with a bit of exposition. It's like if someone took pop psychology 101 and read the Wikipedia article on theoretical physics; these interrupting TED talks are a way to broach these complex issues and theories without ever really engaging with them. In another timeline an adult Nemo has devoted himself to photographing and recoding decay, which allows him to reverse footage and, in vain, combat entropy. And as he makes that agonising decision at the train, his shoe slips, and the fates of all the timelines comes up to pure luck. Time and time again Van Dormael will rob these coincidences of any emotional factor or impact. What does it matter whether he chooses mum or dad? Maybe a tiny, split second decision will render it all in vain anyway. Maybe he will slip and be crushed by the train itself. Van Dormael blows up every little moment and decision as if it was some pivotal, life-changing fork in the road - with agonising slow motion, shallow focus shots and a desperate, wistful score to milk every last drop of profundity and poignancy from the scene. It thinks itself to be a vast and universal treatment, exploring every single possibility, every timeline, every tiny decision, but it's actually remarkably closed off. When Van Dormael doesn't know how to close off a plot line, he will write in incidents of blind or dumb luck, as if that is how life goes - a car crash or two, a gas explosion, a murder. And in the final ending, it collapses on itself and invalidates its own logic by creating an entirely different, implausible scenario by itself, thinking that it has earned that satisfying conclusion. It hasn't at all - it is inexplicable how we end up with the perfect story, having only briefly explored all the other wrong turns. And it presents an illusion on the fate of not choosing at all - to not choose is also a choice. One might wonder if little Nemo had wore a different pair of shoes and slipped and cracked his head on that open field - but the movie does not even concern itself with this bigger problem it has created. It just presents a neat little science-fiction type resolution, and it is unsatisfying. It doesn't help that the final destination of Anna leaves much to desire. The experiences and scenes of their youth are sweet enough, but this hardly seems to mean they are fated to be together forever. Van Dormael drenches this timeline with unbearably sappy moments as if to loudly signal that this is 'the one': staring at each other in bed, making dramatic lifelong promises of true love, layering flashbacks over each other. And visually he pulls out the all stops - time lapses that create frozen moments of time where they catch each other's eye, seamless edits that link past and present, transitions that use eye and photo motifs. But it's all in vain - it undermines any genuine relationship it creates by telling us exactly which thread of fate is the perfect one. There's no need to be interested if we just patiently wait for the right choices to be made. Kruger's performance is strangely hollow for what is supposed to be the dream girl. Jeanne is merely an afterthought, while Polley's Elise manages to actually be engaging in the little time she is afforded. It's timeline has the most coherency of them all - despite all the jump in and outs, it maintains a solid emotional tension. Polley's acting, particularly in that forced happiness during the birthday party, is so painfully striking and true. But like all the other timelines, it still descends into that same pitfall. Van Dormael focuses on single little moment - maybe buying a pair of cheap Brazilian jeans, or saying a wrong word, or helping a homeless man, and creates this dramatic, feigned importance around it. But instead of lifting giving it poignancy, all it does it sabotage itself for more and more interruptions. What about 2 minutes ago, when you had milk instead of juice for breakfast? What about when you put on your left shoe first instead of your right? What if Nemo had not been the child of the heterosexual white couple? Mr Nobody tries so desperately to grab onto every little possibility, and ends up giving none of them any real emotional significance at all.",5,2,4,8 March 2016
Get Out," Russel Wilson - hybrid.
","Get Out is at its best when it is busy tightening the screws around its audience, who are shifting uncomfortably around in their seats as black protagonist Chris Washington is assaulted by a barrage of micro-aggressions from his girlfriend's family. She's Allison Williams as the courageous Rose Armitage, treading through racial boundaries and taboos to find love. She also constantly finds herself apologising for the way in her parents and sibling welcome Chris into the family, fetishising his race and proudly brandishing their token Armitage minority like a shiny black trophy. Rose isn't just looking past skin colour, but actively calling out these incidents on behalf of her boyfriend, defending his man while flashing a smile so dazzling she must have stepped straight out of a Colgate commercial. A little too perfect. Scarier than the expected spikes in the soundtrack and the blank smiles of the black servants are the trenches that Chris must navigate in his introduction to the Armitage estate. Peele closely tiptoes the line between satire and reality here, accompanied by the sheer ease in which Daniel Kaluuya slips into a role that he seems to have lived his entire lifetime; expected sighs, a narrowing of the eyes at every other inappropriate comment, a shake of the head after the moment is briefly disarmed. This constant unease and discomfort is more alarming than the film's clichéd 'gotcha' horror scares, especially coming from the well-worn performances of Whitford and Keener, who do a better job of hiding their sinister intentions than the help, and a ratty brother who looks Chris up and down like a specimen in a lab. Even when these are obviously signposted ('I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could') they retain their sharpness like a gut punch; it's racial prejudice rebranded as simpering patronisation. The villains of the film aren't right-wing Nazis or hardcore racists, but white liberals who think themselves gracious by welcoming minorities into their household, patting them on the back and calling them 'my man' once too many times. Peele is taking aim at a uniquely intriguing clique here, painting a sleek, pristine portrait of a dreamy, post-racial America that is conveniently situated within an upper-class mansion, tucked away in some quiet, idyllic forest. His intentions are fascinating and sobering all at once, but the overall message is wrapped up in a rather clumsy, obvious metaphor that uses tired horror conventions to ramp up anxiety levels. Peele came from skit comedy, and it shows; the film's premise could be one of his older five minute sketches, of white liberals so obsessed with overcompensating for the past that they are literally snatching up the bodies of these fine black specimens and immortalising themselves within them. They worship their newfound vessel, parade his physical talents for all to see, slap the cigarette out of his hands, and arrive in an ominous procession to bid for the rights to claim him. While Peele establishes a valid target in the first half of the movie, the second veers into a sort of cheap, exploitation territory where we are actively cheering for each posh cult member Chris offs in his bid for freedom. It grafts deeper dichotomies through scenes such as where the white-robed Rose sips milk and googles (sorry, bings) top NCCA prospects with a blank stare, or through the character of Rod, the polar opposite of the genteel black boyfriend in Chris, a loudmouth caricature of a ghetto TSA agent who does the digging into the Armitage conspiracy (he's no longer the target of 'random' spot checks, but rather on the other side of them, exposing lies). These characterisations are low-hanging fruit disguised as complex attitudes, and although we applaud as Rod steps out of the car to save the day, what do we really learn from this? That his concerns were correct all along, and that black men should stay away from dating white women altogether? There's more alarming authenticity packed into that split second of dread that Chris and the entire audience register as the sirens roll up to the scene of a black man strangling a white woman than there is in the rest of the film. To actually have a cop (or, if he was really subtle about it, the same cop from the deer encounter) emerge from the car and clasp Chris in handcuffs would be bludgeoning the point in, yet prove a whole lot more. But Rod takes us back to square one. His fears have been validated.",6,0,2,27 May 2017
Frozen," You can't marry a man you just met.
","The first thing you notice about Frozen is how beautiful the animated world is. We are barely familiar with Arendelle before being plunged into an eternal magical winter. The contrasting colours is very noticeable, especially in one scene where Anna, Kristoff and Sven appear in the warm, sunny daydream of Olaf. Their darker and more reserved outfits are clearly out of place. At the end of the film, when the uplifting choir ballad 'Vuelie' plays once again as the browns, greens and soft blues return to a thawed Arendelle, the colour scheme works with the score to bring a change in tone, and a happy ending. Colour is often overlooked but it is a very important element of Frozen. The animation is visually breathtaking. Attention to detail is spectacular; from the creases in the outfits, to the ripples and reflections in the water as ships dock. The snow is a delight to watch as characters tumble around, fall, throw snowballs and glide amongst the trees. It's very realistic. And of course, the Norwegian influence is evident. The overhead tilt to Aurorea Borealis at the beginning, the fjords, the rustic Medieval castle design. You'll feel as if you already have one foot in Arendelle. Frozen follows the steps of Tangled in subverting the traditional princess role. Like Rapunzel leaving her tower and taking matters into her own hands, Anna does the same in attempting to reconcile with her sister. The straight-laced, formal and polite princess is gone; Rapunzel whacking Flynn on the head with a frying pan was the start of it, and Kristin Bell manages to take it further in the character of Anna. It's a very lifelike voice performance, especially compared to the more regal and composed Elsa; she hesitates and stutters, she has momentary lapses of concentration, and she likes to stuff her face with chocolate and ice cream. There are more reversal of tropes in Frozen which give it a unique perspective. The sudden engagement of Hans and Anna is treated as ridiculous, at the end Kristoff and Anna merely start dating and don't hurriedly fall in love and get married, and most important of all, true love means not romantic love, but the love between two sisters. It's a very satisfying and unexpected route to take in an age where irrelevant of distracting romance is seemingly shoehorned into many films. Even better it's not a twist for twists sake.There is little excess in Frozen's script. The true love twist where Elsa sacrifices herself for Anna is built up from the beginning of the movie. The upbeat yet heartbreaking montage of 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman' utilises appropriately aged versions and voices of Anna and Elsa to provide a tragic back-story. You can see the struggle of Elsa as she tries to control her powers and prevent harm to her sister. There's the symbolism of the carefree and playful Olaf, a reminder of their past and the protective nature of Elsa. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez's soundtrack is magical. While Tangled starts with a pop ballad, the opening of Frozen feels much more like a musical. The synchronized movements and beats of the ice merchants feels like a dance sequence, the chanting reminiscent of the army's chants in Mulan's 'I'll Make a Man Out of You'. The excitement of Anna is musically represented in the the lively and spirited strings opening of 'For The First Time in Forever', which manages to blend flawlessly with parts of Elsa's 'Let It Go'. The mix of the contrasting themes gradually crescendos before opening the gates and again during a later confrontation in the ice castle and is a stirring and emotive way of building tension between the sisters. Idina Menzel's rendition of 'Let It Go' is perhaps the best performance of the film, which in 3 minutes captures the plight of Anna's struggle with her identity and powers before she finally releases all the pent up frustration, anger and fear. Josh Gad's 'In Summer' is both charming and hilarious, as is Jonathan Groff's 'Reindeers Are Better Than People'. The only misstep is the rock troll's 'Fixer Upper' which not only tries to force a romantic angle that is only just starting to form, but also takes place right after a potentially fatal ice strike to the heart, making it tonally inconsistent. There are flaws which prevent Frozen from reaching its full potential. The premise for the sister's separation is quite weak. It's hard to imagine Elsa staying in the one room for years on end. What's even more baffling is the parenting technique of two barely fleshed out characters who force Elsa to conceal her true self and never attempt to practice or control her powers. The mother doesn't even have a single line of dialogue! Had the parents been built up as more three-dimensional characters maybe this decision wouldn't seem so foolish. Instead they are quickly killed off and forgotten. The rock trolls exist as nothing more than poor and repetitive character design, serving no purpose other than for one wise old man to give sagely advice. Not exactly ground-breaking. At times the quirky humorous route that Olaf takes becomes sheer indulgence and unnecessary: 'I don't have a skull.' Lastly, the setting of the mountains contains no visual logic and is uneven and confusing. One moment they are along a cliff edge, then they are jumping between two cliffs, then they are thrown off one; an especially lazy moment is when Olaf stumbles upon a staircase that 'leads exactly where you want to go'. Overall, Frozen is visually stunning, immersive and captivating. Both soundtrack and score are pleasing and the voice acting is excellent. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction and at times reminiscent of the Disney Renaissance.",8,3,6,27 January 2015
Room," There's not enough room...space...
","Room was written in 2010 by Emma Donoghue and through close collaboration with director Lenny Abrahamson, who had written a letter and convinced her of his understanding of the novel and its characters, it was finally brought to the big screen in 2015. An immediate difference that the medium brings is the removal of the five year old first-person perspective of Jack who views 'Room' through his young, inexperienced lens. A novel's perspective can hide and obscure certain details depending on how and from where it is told - when Richard Adams' Watership Down was adapted into animation, it lost the nightmarish quality of encountering phenomena such as trains and cars through the rabbit's eyes, and in this film we also know from the start their predicament. But what is lost in perspective is supplemented through cinematic features, primarily in the cinematography by Danny Cohen. The first half of the film, comprised solely of scenes of life within the shed known as Room, are shot with long lenses, which thrust the camera up close and personal, compressing the space between foreground and background and visualising the claustrophobia of their existence. The shallow-focus brought about by the lens is particularly essential as the camera centres clearly on Jack and Joy, seeking to maintain the illusion of infinity that he has been raised to believe. An early crucial scene aligns the camera alongside Jack as he goes through his morning routine by greeting each inhabitant of Room, the frame bouncing from closeup to closeup of fingers brushing lamp, plant, TV and toilet. Cohen returns to the same routine in the final scene but now framed as a wide shot, and the imaginary space of Room is shrunken to a mere ten by ten shed. The film retains an air of mystery because like Jack, we are made aware of the situation piece by piece. The first sighting of Uncle Nick is in the pitch darkness of night, and we can merely hear his muffled voice as we are perched next to Jack in his tiny bed. The next night he gains a little bravery, and peeks through the shutters of the wardrobe to see the vague outlines of a man in bed with his ma. In the next night he steps out, and then only finally does Abrahamson allow us a glimpse of the person who has imprisoned them inside the shed. Room shows to us the intricate and desperate lengths to which a mother will attempt to shield her child from the dangers of truth, and how Joy wields the inherent wonders and imagination of Jack to assist this process (she's even made up a story to convince him to help her scream for help through the vents each day). Through their dialogue we catch pieces of the mythos and story that she has painstakingly created to give some semblance of a life, an education, a healthy mind and body and a family for Jack, and how his leaving of the wardrobe and the loss of Nick's job demand the necessity of 'unlying' and finally confessing the truth of their life. Viewers will inevitably discover, through the trailers or through mathematical deduction, that they do make it out of Room and back into the real world, but the escape scene remains one of the best scenes of the year. Stephen Rennicks' score, which has been up until that moment comprised of whimsical tracks designed to illustrate the wondrous imagination of Jack, suddenly cues in a thudding, rhythmic beating of the bass drum, which slowly becomes one with Jack's and the audience's heartbeat and gradually rises in tempo. The open expanse of sky becomes an infinite tapestry, stretching the boundaries of the frame and beyond the comprehension of Jack's little brain. The way in which he stumbles and is almost reclaimed by the grasp of Jack, the way in which we scream at the screen as he forgets the name of his ma, and the agonising wait in which the police piece together his whispers and rush over to the shed make this sequence taut with tension. By the time of their reunion I was emotionally and physically drained. But there is also the challenge of maintaining momentum after this hair-raising escape, and the lull in its aftermath. Abrahamson wisely resists the obvious and exploitative temptation of focusing on Nick and his outcome, concerned not with punishment but rather the healing process of the victims. We see Joy, now without the immediate day-to-day struggle of survival on the inside, collapse and withdraw into the trauma of the years inside the shed, but also the regret of Jack's early years. Larson is a marvel. A question from a reporter insinuates something that she has been trying for years to deny (that she could not give Jack the life he truly deserved), and in the weariness and desperation etched in her face, she makes us believe that the stories and mythos of Room were important coping mechanisms for her as they were for Jack. In Short Term 12, Larson's past of abuse was a convenient mirroring for the youth she cared for (and resulted in cutesy scenarios like following behind at a certain length instead of actual engagement), but here she makes the guilt come from within a place deeply buried for the sake of herself and her son. Tremblay's musings occasionally become a little cloy for the subject matter ('Meltedy Spoon' or the 'strong' in his Samson-length hair), but Larson reigns him and his short temper in with such patience and empathy we often forget that she is merely a teenager herself. Joy's motherhood may not be 'good enough' from outside standards, but she's ma, and they will heal and grow together.",9,1,4,24 December 2016
Schindler's List," What's one worth to you?
","Spielberg once stated that Schindler's List is not about the millions that were killed during the Holocaust, but rather about the one thousand that were saved. It's a very important thing to consider when looking at some of the criticisms levelled at this great film. There have been documentaries that have attempted to capture the atrocities of the Holocaust but even so none come close to the unflinching and systematic mass murder of the event. Schindler's List doesn't attempt to provide an substantial and unbiased view of it. It is a story about one man in particular and his absolute good. Even so, the film does attempt to place itself within the reality of the events and create some sense of authenticity. Apart from the powerful bookends which are drenched in colour, the black and white documentary approach serves its agelessness and heightens the intensity of some scenes; the first look we get at the enigma of Oskar Schindler, catch-lights hitting his twinkling eyes at the party, or when a little boy attempts to hide in the underground box full of sewerage. Hand- held is also used intensively and to great effect - the rounding up of naked Jews, the extended liquidation scene, scrambling around the camp in madness in avoiding a psychopath with a sniper rifle. Spielberg doesn't overdose the film with visual tricks but shows it for what it is (the lack of storyboarding aided this), making those little touches all the more effective - quick match cuts to show the various inept secretaries that are hired anyway, Kingley's distant voice-over as Goeth executes lined up boys silently and mercilessly, and the most powerful motif of them all, the girl in the red coat, a symbol of innocence lost and atrocity committed. There are two exceptional performances here. The first is of course Neeson, who brings to the table a great charisma and pragmaticism that later dissolves into sympathy and great courage. We first are charmed like the German officers at the party (I love the great touch of the officer moving forward to get closer to Oskar in the photo, obscuring the pretty girl he was initially wooing), and through voice-over and a photo we receive those charms again through the lavish gifts of champagne, caviar and sardines. Spielberg does not create a moment of realisation or change; it is a gradual and subtle process that Oskar goes through. He is not the morally pure and idealistic man we look for in a Hollywood production such as this - he initially hires an entire group of secretaries not to save them, but to further his womanising and marital affairs, and when a one-armed man comes to thank him for saving his life, Neeson's face is struck and visibly confused; we wonder if he has ever been the receiver of such sincerity and gratitude. But that changes when he realises the gravity of the situation ('He was a metal press operator'). Oskar's front is of course the affable German business man, concerned only about profit, but in glimpses he shows his true humanity and courage in front of the Nazis: a long kiss on his birthday, a determination to see worker's thirsts quenched, and in that final teary-eyed heart wrenching monologue, a complete reversal of his ambitions. John Williams' iconic violin theme is stirring and most evident here. The other is Fiennes' Goeth, who takes a despicable monster and adds tiny tinges of humanity that make his character all the more terrifying. His introduction is telling, a faceless POV in the back of the car before we reveal him, not some intimidating figure, but an irritated man with a cold: 'Ja, why is the top down? I'm f*cking freezing.' Another one of these moments is a brilliant scene where he corners Helen in the baseless, shivering and terrified. Goeth ignores this, constructing a rather tender conversation in his mind, and we witness a insatiable conflict in his mind, unbelieving that he has fallen for a 'jew bitch'. He almost gives in, but his Nazi sensibilities come back to him and he strikes her. This segment is brilliantly inter cut with kisses of another location, the modest Jewish wedding and the lavish birthday party where Oskar kisses many. This man is truly barbaric, and even a clever appeal to his ego from Oskar ('I pardon you.') does not satisfy his cold murderous streak. What Fiennes does is give us a tiny bit of insight into a man like Goeth, because to us it seems inexplicable that such a man could do such sadistic things and be instrumental in genocide. And so, he loses Helen over a game of 21. They bargain over the life of these essential jew workers, and Goeth's question to Schindler is perhaps a moment of realisation of what he must do. One little moment in the montage of compiling the list is a overlooked appearance from another Righteous Among the Nations, Julius Madritsch, who save thousands of Jews himself. I am struck by how his story and many others could similarly be rightfully portrayed as a compelling act of bravery in the face of such evil, much like Oskar Schindler's. His story was almost never told; a fateful encounter between writer Thomas Keneally and a Schindler's Jew in Poldek Pfefferberg was the basis of a book and later this film. Pfefferberg's own words are particularly telling about this great man: 'Schindler gave me my life, and I tried to give him immortality.' And in this film, he has achieved it.",10,9,13,19 September 2015
Across the Universe," Strawberry Jams
","There are and will always be musical diehards who adamantly oppose these types of musical tributes. Who steadfastly believe in maintaining the integrity and artistry of the original Beatles. Those people are missing out on something quite wonderful (and if they listened to Joe Cocker's rendition of With a Little Help from My Friends they would be quite surprised). Across the Universe is a scrambled story, at times valuing its music ahead of its characters or its narrative, and sometimes suffering from the Glee syndrome. That is the mistake of overstuffing the screen-time with as many relevant titles as possible, or in some cases, not exactly valuing the meaning of the song. Both commit the same error with Blackbird, and there are others that seem unnecessary in ATU and hastily speed up the story; Something and Across the Universe come to mind, and Sturgess and Carpio's character names seem there for that sole purpose. But for every one of these there are three others that seem to perfectly encapsulate what our characters are thinking, and what the period is trying to force onto them. There are a few twists on the Beatles classics. Across the backdrop of towering rusty mills, a football team and cheerleader frolic on a turf that is so perfectly torched yellow it must have been Delbonnel's work in post production. Prudence sings I Want To Hold Your Hand in a wistful way, and the object of affection's gender is flipped, and it becomes tragic. Hold Me Tight switches between two aesthetics - the brightly lit and synchronised dancing of a prom, and the grungy underground den of a dance club in Liverpool. Evan Rachel Wood's version manages to capture that young love and one last night feeling much better than the original could. Julie Taymor brings along her expertise as director of the stage musical The Lion King and ATU doesn't hold back an ounce of its theatricality. I've often referred to this film as an assortment of beautiful music videos, and the costuming, production design and eye-poppingly colourful cinematography from Delbonnel certainly speak for themselves. Bono's I Am the Walrus is run through a psychedelic rainbow filter, there are hauntingly slow underwater ballets, strawberries leak red juice and crimson splashes are superimposed with the Vietnam bombings while Anderson and Sturgess harmonise tightly from afar. There are some audacious stylistic set choices. As Jojo (modelled after Jimi Hendrix) arrives in New York, the city lights turns cold and blue-green, beggars and prostitutes serenade him from the street, neon signs buzz from all directions, and hundreds of corporate suits dance rhythmically while he is left out. The group stumble upon a bizarre travelling circus whose costumes and colours pop out in the countryside background. And Max returning injured from war is subject to a dizzyingly absurd dream sequence where the hospital beds churn like a Round Up amusement ride and identical seductive nurses provide the only relief: painkillers. The narrative is one of love first and foremost, and the revolution of the 60s, the counter-culture, the protest of the Vietnam War, all secondary objectives. Taymor prefers to present this via songs rather than exposition or scenes, which is sometimes rushed due to the amount of them (34 separate musical numbers!) Yes it is a little cheesy, the hippie protest not really taken seriously, and the love story one we've seen before, but it is easy to get swept up in the journey. There are some fantastic little touches that scream Beatles love letter rather than a period piece. One is the upbeat timing on Max's frenzied Jude cry that Paul made iconic, which matches perfectly with the moment he sees his dear old friend again in America. Another is the end of Jeff Beck's A Day in the Life, where we frantically zoom in on Jude's discovery of what he thinks is Lucy's death, and the famous long note which took four pianos explodes with the newspapers scraps to reveal him sitting along on the beach, in mourning. It culminates in a roof-top rendition of the ultimate make love not war song of the 60s. Sure, it's a global message but it's much more important for the lovestruck pair than it is for the political and contextual backdrop. Flaws can be found if you are persistent. The story lines are rather shallow; Max comes and goes and never really ends up anywhere after serving, relationship dynamics see-saw in 213 minutes, it's a little sappy at times...there are other problems that could be pointed out with closer analysis. But Across the Universe is stunning to look at, and easy to sing along with.",7,0,0,5 November 2015
The Incredibles," We're superheroes. What could happen?
","What could happen indeed? The Incredibles opens with an action packed introduction of the title superheroes at the peak of their powers - even in the romance department they are sorted. It's a vividly engaging sequence which hints at the sort of relationship Mr Incredible and Elastigirl have beneath those masks, with some playful, almost seductive dialogue. The husky voice acting of Holly Hunter is excellent in this context but also throughout the film in moments of marriage and motherhood. But skip 15 years and a couple hundred lawsuits and suddenly the age of superheroes is over. It's a distinct tonal shift; the warmth and bravado of the past is replaced with a desaturated and mute palette, highlighting the suburban nuclear life the Parrs now live. Mr Incredible is now out of shape and stuck behind a desk, scamming and weaselling citizens out of their money rather than saving them from burning buildings. It's a Watchmen-like premise; what if superheroes were suddenly uninvited and no longer favoured in the public? And the way Brad Bird introduces us to this new age is so effective and subtle. The revelation of Dash's powers are presented via a seemingly normal occurrence of a misbehaving child forced to go to the principal's office. It's never overtly said but it characterises the over-energetic and impulsive Dash immediately. Bird even manages to incorporate humour and a sense of the absurd in what is a typical parenting issue (Don't Bernie me!). Same with Violet, her powers are also thematically connected to her personality, melting away in thin air at the sight of her crush due to that teenage nervousness. The way their powers are embedded within the narrative of their civilian relocated lives is done very well. It strengthens the characterisation of the family and creates the opposing viewpoints of Helen and Bob at that point in their lives. Bob gets angry after being fired and in a fit of rage lifts up his entire car while a normal person might just yell. He also carves up Dash's steak so hard he breaks the whole plate. It's all done realistically so that when the dinner table conversation turns sour and they break out their powers, you get a sense of where this family's at. There's humour in Jack Jack's cheering and the sudden freeze and swiftness in which they go back to normal (ala what they should be pretending to be). Beyond that we get more instances of their powers twisting their day to day lives; zoom outs to Bob working out with entire trains, casually lifting up the couch during vacuum cleaning, playing football but with inflated passing yards (later again utilised in the climax). It all progresses evenly; Helen wants the kids to hide their powers, but later praises them for their quick adaptability, and finally they compromise in the end when Dash comes 2nd in the race. Brad Bird of all people voices the eccentric fashion designer Edna Mode for both ordinary supermodels and heroes. It's a wonderfully bizarre performance brimming full of peculiar mannerisms and memorable dialogue. In particular the no capes sequence which pokes fun at the typical fashion trend of heroes to have that excessive feature. Little titbits like this point to how Bird can turn self awareness of the genre's tropes into funny situations, since by itself it doesn't exactly mean anything except a nod to the audience. A similar memorable line is when Buddy reveals himself to Mr Incredible after all those long years and launches into a typical recount. Bob is seemingly about to strike on the momentarily distracted Syndrome when suddenly he catches him mid flight with his laser and laughs heartily: 'You caught me monologuing, you sly dog!' Delightful. As well as this you also have to commend the conversation between Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) and his wife as he struggles to find his super-suit. The juxtaposition of the wife's indifference to the invasion and her indignation at missing their dinner with the action scenes playing outside the window is hilarious. 'I am your wife! I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get!'Michael Giacchino's first collaboration with Pixar is a stylish success. The score could almost be lifted off the 60s era of spy flicks, as evident by the matching set designs of the initial scenes in the introduction of the film. The predominantly brass composition adds a jazzy tone and provides rhythm and energy to the action scenes. The main theme in particular is very reminiscent of James Bond. Indeed Pixar initially wanted John Barry to compose a similar score to that of the 1969 Bond flick, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The big band jazz sound makes for a thrilling and stylish addition to the overall film. The Incredibles is everything modern superhero films are not. It doesn't overwhelm you with frenzied end of world odds or chaotic action sequences, and its humour is well placed and not jarringly inserted as a witty one liner or quip. Most of all the characters are written with refreshing earnesty and sincerity. Although they may possess some incredible abilities, the Parrs are not so different from any other dysfunctional family.",9,0,0,17 July 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," Please Stand By
","Initially, we believe Sonny is an accomplished and capable criminal. He knows all the tricks of the trade that the tellers employ. There's humour in the way he dismissively scatters the decoy bills, as if he has done this a hundred times and is sick of all the charades. Pacino's character is a great mystery and intimacy at once. His bravado persona is played up for the crowd and all the media scrutiny that accompanies the stakeout. His jaded, weary dialogue reflects a criminal who has seen all that the cops throw at you. When they try to ambush him from the back entrance, he becomes utterly incredulous that they would be so disrespectful and not take his criminal aspirations seriously. Again and again he reminds everyone that he holds the hostages, and therefore the power. Then the facade begins to slowly crack, and he has trouble believing it himself. John Wojtowicz, who the character is based upon, watched The Godfather right before holding up the Chase Manhattan branch. Did Sonny also do the same before attempting his first career crime, hoping that it would inspire a personality that screamed, 'Don't mess with me'? When this part of Sonny peels away, we begin to see the man he truly is underneath. The Catholic in him does not want anyone to get hurt, but to make it a quick and painless job. The bank's manager, Mulvaney, agrees. Boyar plays a great natural role within the bustle of New York City. There are many a people like Mulvaney, who are thinking of their families, and who can instantly see through Sonny's charade and believe that he does not mean to harm anyone. This allows them to chastise and laugh at his lack of preparation only moments after he storms in guns aloft. The NYC influence also allows the crowd to see Sonny as one of their own, revolting against the system, and rally around his cries and stunts. It allows for the delivery boy's moment of stardom, which would mar the tension of any conventional crime thriller set elsewhere, to be a brilliant addition to Lumet's little satirical jabs. The magic of Dog Day Afternoon is in how cleverly and subtly it conceals its act of shifting moralities. At first we fear for the innocent hostages' lives. We see a crazed criminal who is not afraid to use his gun, and has little patience for tricks or holdups. We are like Mulvaney, edging slowly and carefully, hoping to resolve this without bloodshed. By the end of the film the oddball group has miraculously become a dysfunctional family. When Maria is let go as part of the bargain, she cries out in relief, half sobbing, half laughing. And then she turns and says something that would be, again, completely out of place in another film: 'Sal, 'cause this is your first plane trip, don't be scared, okay?' And she hands over her rosary beads too. When did this relationship develop? When did they have this heart-to-heart talk? When did the dynamic cease to be kidnapper-hostage? Was it when Sylvia, instead of walking straight to freedom, gave a wave to the cameras and returned to accompany her girls? Or when Sonny ensures that the asthmatic guard and diabetic Mulvaney get the treatment they need? At the start of the film we are hoping no innocent blood will be shed. By the end of it, these innocents are part of the crusade themselves, and we have been positioned like the community, clenching our hands together and hoping that the gang make it on their plane and fly away to safety. The crowd is fickle, of course. They waver when they discover Sonny's bisexuality - even though he is only doing it to pay for his wife's gender re-assignment. Lumet has so carefully tread the line here. Leon is not made an easy target for the masses, or a lazy stereotype. His nails may be done and his voice a little high-pitched as his nerves flare up, but the most important thing is that he is in pain. There is a wonderful, loving, stormy and hurting relationship here between the lines. No doubt something has happened, and it has torn them apart, but the love burns strongly afterwards, so much so that Sonny has decided to rob a bank when he has been a good Catholic all his life. The phone-call is heart-wrenching. Another smaller scene is the same. Leon has been dragged in from a psychiatric hospital to be harshly interrogated by a horde of policemen. When he admits he feels like a woman in a man's body, a cop in the background who has been holding in his laugh cannot smother it any longer and lets it out. Leon's reaction is not even anger, or outrage. We understand this is a usual reaction he endures everyday. It is simply sad resignation. Another tragic character is Sal, who is pushed to one side by the stage-stealing Sonny. Cazale is silent, forlorn, timid. Like Sonny he does not feel comfortable about robbing a bank, only he is not equipped with the shouting skills to pretend otherwise. He simply closes in on himself and curls away into a corner, internalising. He exchanges small talk with the tellers, who are ironically much more relaxed and cheerful than him. He refuses a smoke: his body is a temple. Oddly enough, his body throughout the film is sweating furiously, visualising all the stress for him. Are these bad people, or simply people who have hit a dead end and find themselves with no other choice? We might not be driven to the same ends, but we agree with their frustrations. They are so human and painfully drawn that we feel for them. Some rob a bank. Other kick a chair, or throw a plate, or a punch. We can channel it elsewhere in our lives, and find we are not so different.",10,0,1,18 May 2016
Amadeus," It is miraculous.
","Amadeus, or Loved by God. We view this figure through the historical lens of an ageing and seemingly senile Antonio Salieri, but I am struck by how clearly his memory haunts him, however accurate his representation of Mozart may be. In reality, Mozart was not some genius whose notes came to him as easy as breathing did, but that is how Salieri remembers it. We see how beautifully his recount flows in the editing; how these L cuts create such magnificent sound-bridges which link each period of Salieri's fall and Mozart's rise like a symphony. A crumpled letter from the angry Leopold transitions into the sound scattering a flock of deer as the Emperor proposes his niece as a pupil. Caterina Cavalieri is one minute a student of Salieri, the next inexplicably the star of Mozart's Seraglio, another cruel blow. And in the most evocative scene of them all, where a disbelieving Salieri inspects Mozart's original works, and each turn of the page unveils another masterpiece, and both Salieri's are trapped in ecstasy. F. Murray Abraham's dual roles are masterful; in one he is silent, so caught up in the majesty of these ink-strokes on the page as he trembles, and in the elderly voice-over, recalling the discovery crystal clear, and we know how wrapped up he still is after all these years in conflict, in admiration, in respect, in bitterness and unbearable envy at being passed over by God. See the contempt as the father hums along to the recognisable strings of Mozart's Serenade No. 13. I must admit I too can only recognise one of the three, and so there is a little bit of truth in this dramatisation. Who does God choose? Not some respectable, esteemed genius but a rather crude and vulgar child playing games through the halls. The most iconic part of Hulce's performance is of course the peals of his high- pitched feverish laughter which seem to punctuate the guise of each formal setting that he enters. Some would say it is out of place. I would say that it is highly appropriate for Salieri's tales; the laughter becomes infuriating, and each instance of it only further confirms his anguish and disbelief that such a crass and unrefined brat be gifted with such musical genius. This is God mocking him with the same giggle, divine injustice personified. In its production design the film is of course gorgeous. The sets and costumes are detailed alike, bathed in natural light, and made alive. We see how exquisite dress is required for symbolising status, these great billowing gowns, ridiculous wigs and enormous headpieces, but it is the act of removing them that we get a more authentic characterisation, as seen in the nervously determined way in which Constanze offers up her body to boost her husband's career (and look at how defiant Salieri is, in refusing and determining he is to beat Mozart fair and square, not by some act of God). In another Director's Cut exclusive, as he plays a jaunty tune to cure a rowdy dog, these simple notes transition into the gorgeous 3rd movement of his 15th Piano Concerto. Other pieces of his work are brilliantly entangled into the drama. The immense, brash opening of Don Giovanni's Overture blasts as we break open the doors to find an elderly Salieri with bloody wrists and an inconsolable heart, wracked by the guilt of his sinful deed in destroying a genius. The same is used as Leopold re-enters atop a staircase in black, and as the same dark foreboding costume by Salieri is used to trigger his composition of his unfinished Requiem, and to loudly announce the death of a father. These moments hit us as abruptly thunderous as they do to Mozart, and his music mourns and weeps for him. Abraham's performance carries each opera, and provides us with an audience proxy by which we appreciate in its extremities. His voice- over is so remarkably tender and the sounds of the symphonies reaches into his storytelling years and years gone by, as he describes what is simply notes on a page with the most unabashed admiration. And there is conflict, the most painful conflict I have ever witnessed on screen. Watch as his eyes shut in bliss upon Mozart's work, and as they scrunch up in petty glee upon a simple yawn. Oh, but he went to each and every one of those five performances. As he tricks Mozart into composing a masterpiece under his own name, he himself becomes entranced by the master at work. He formerly remarked that Mozart's music was as effortless as taking dictation from God, and here he can barely dictate the words coming from a bed-ridden Mozart. But still he is horrified as Constanze demands they cease composing, and lives the rest of his life in utter regret. In one conversation, he advises Mozart to end his operas with a bang, to inform the audience when to applaud. And yet, he knows in his heart that Mozart's music speaks for itself, and that the audience should know, as he so very much knows, when to put their hands together. And as I finished this film, I too knew this feeling.",10,2,3,22 November 2015
The Game," The game is up.
","Much of The Game is presented as your stock standard thriller, with all the Fincher touches. Flashbacks flicker in our main character Nicholas Van Orton's mind, using old video footage to establish the tragedy that still lingers many years later. The vast, dim halls of his mansion are lonely, something that its elegance and luxury cannot hide. When he leaves the comfort of his wealth, he is bombarded with rubbish dumps and dirty back alleys, and sirens and street lights, overexposed, blast at his eyes. When he enters the hotel room that seeks to incriminate him, there is that cold blue tint, nearly as menacing as its contents, and Fincher uses a favoured technique; a flurry of inserts of sexually compromising photographs, lines of cocaine, and bloody tissues that just won't be flushed away. The mystery of CBS, the corporation hired to change Nicholas' life, draws us naturally in like it does for him. Like any mystery, no one is determined to give him a straight answer. His brother Conrad remarks that it changed his life, as do several gentlemen at a club who have also been through the program. Their pleasantries hide a hint of menace and threat underneath and the possibilities stack up in Nicholas' mind: what possibly could be so mind blowing and life changing that could not be revealed in anything but cryptic dialogue? There is a particularly clever scene where it appears that they have infiltrated his TV and home, and the newscaster talks to him directly through the screen. It shows a voyeuristic angle of Nicholas in his room, and this is immediately frightening - more so once he discovers that he himself has brought the surveillance into his own home. The paranoia is ramped up significantly in the ease of which the actor disguises himself from the housemaid. Unfortunately, the movie cannot quite maintain this level of tension. What is initially complex and intriguing takes a route into a more confusing and muddled path that doesn't entirely add up. The script is dictated by those moments of shock that seek to disarm Nicholas and render him at his most vulnerable, and then again and again. It moves from plot development to plot development at a frenzied pace, never letting him completely breathe or react. It spends the majority of the film dismantling his entire private and public life, and is so obsessed with throwing plot twist after twist at Nicholas that there is little time devoted to the actual moral of the tale, to change his outlook on life and create a new person. We are simply supposed to accept that this series of traumatic and debilitating events will suddenly bring about a change in his miserable life - the resolution of It's a Wonderful Life tacked on to a mystery thriller. The actors are a mixed bag. Douglas does well with what he is given to work with, and is almost believable as the broken man who has had everything stripped away from him. He is given no moment of eventual emotional catharsis and has to quickly switch from that destroyed identity to the birthday boy. There is little actual chemistry between the chosen female character who leads him towards the centre of the conspiracy, but the script is audacious enough to suggest an eventual romance anyway. And Penn, who flits in and out of the story as required, he feels less like a brother than someone who is playing a very cruel prank. After all, if a man is willingly driven to suicide, it takes more than a plot twist to rejuvenate his life. This is an okay thriller with barely any common sense, a weak back-story and little emotional backing. The second time around, there's not much to admire. And who the hell are all the people who bothered to turn up at his party? Isn't he supposed to be a miserable, uptight loner?",6,0,1,1 February 2016
Hero," Ying xiong
","Hero is concerned not only with physical prowess and ability, but also the battles that occur within the mind. The entire film then takes place solely within the confines of the king of Qin's palace, and they are trading stories, not blows. Like in Rashomon, they are fighting for their own version of the story, attempting to gain an upper hand in the proceedings. And within these stories there are also mental battles; Long Sky and Nameless' initial clash is in their imagination, a vicious one-on-one muted in grey-scale. They are like chess grandmasters, with each blow calculated and bringing infinite possibilities and outcomes, so that the fight is over before it has begun. Their mastery of the art of swordfighting makes this possible. The choreography of Hero is in the wuxia style, which has been codified over time so that Western audiences may also come to appreciate and know its art. Masters of the style float over long distances as if they are suspended by strings, barely needing to touch the ground before they gracefully float away again (affectionately dubbed 'wire-fu'). When they fight their movements are so ferociously fluid that they whip up leaves into tornadoes, which curl around the characters themselves. Zhang Yimou is concerned with form as much as he is with function; Flying Snow does not merely repel, but dances amongst the rain of arrows, and the writers inside are painting with ink as red as blood, also fiercely devoted to their craft. Consider this: Broken Sword derives his mastery of swordplay from the strokes of his calligraphy. Or is it the other way around?The prominent art of Christopher Doyle is also on display. He begins with an initial dreary grey, a drabness to the present day story. This allows for the sharp contrast of the stories the two men tell, which are each punctuated strongly with their own colour code. There are a many number of possibilities and interpretations here. I was shocked by the vividness of the red ink, and its likeness to the blood shed by the diligent students of calligraphy. In the demonstration of the 10 pace killing technique Doyle and Yimou find beauty and tranquility in the cool blues, the apt slow motion, the little dink of the sound design as the cup lands on the sword. The blade is shown to be as ferocious as it is gentle. Robed in white, he reveals a purer technique, a strike of such surgical precision magnified in the shallow focus and slow motion. Yimou uses the latter well, cutting judiciously from serenity to furious motion, assuming the perspective of these masters who move and see at a different speed level. They whip their blades which such strength that they the metal bends and groans to their touch.The king tells his story with such passion and understanding. In his version, Flying Snow and Broken Sword are lovers so desperate to take the fall for each other they must resort to fighting for that honour. It is a tragic love story, more so than the apparent truth. This also points to the king's understanding of the nature of sacrifice; he is able to imagine the sorrow and grief of a sword twisted just enough to wound but not to kill, and that sword being beaten to save the life of another. So he is also able to recognise the greatest sacrifice of them all, and that sometimes the greatest warrior is the one who lays down their sword. So in the end it is indeed tranquility that wins out.",8,0,0,3 August 2016
Ex Machina," Deus Ex Machina - humanity and gods
","Ex Machina proposes the same question that many other sci-fi flicks of the like pose: what makes us human, what humanity consists of. It's a tough theme to tackle and effectively display on the screen, especially for a directorial debut like Alex Garland's.It's a simplistic production design which draws us in in the same way that it draws Caleb in when arriving at the house, no, the research facility for the first time. The set is claustrophobically sleek despite hidden deep within forests and gorgeous waterfalls. The walls are smooth and stylish but sterile, lacking windows to offer any chance of escape or relent. All this points to a rather lonely existence for the god creator figure in Nathan. The cinematography allows for some subtle inserts of power balances. The framing of the interviews is often reversed despite the roles the two occupy: Caleb rooted to a chair and boxed in within the frame (both literally and metaphorically) while Ava is free to move about in her open space. Sometimes it's not so subtle, as shown when harsh red light signals some more urgent plot advancement and hints of Nathan's evil intentions. The crux of this issue is that Ex Machina sets out from the start to trick the audience. It's a Turing Test in itself; the entire perspective of Ava is shown only to allow us to empathise and convince ourselves of her humanity. It can be argued that this is detrimental or beneficial to the overall quality of the film. It's a clever twist that Garland doesn't quite pull off wit the most grace. Alicia Vikander gives a great performance, particularly in her physical mannerism and speech which highlight her roboticism even without the intricate effects. Yet the same indications exist in Kyoko, the assistant who is very obviously a robot despite the planning of said twist. The absurd dancing scene only hammers down this point and undermines the complexity of the overall theme of the film. It's not helped by the fact that we spend not enough time in the sessions and more waxing lyrical with Nathan and Caleb. In some ways Garland spends more on the development of Nathan (despite him being a very straightforward character) than Caleb. We have to be told at the film's first climax that he is a lonely, susceptible and relatively morally good person rather than it being evident in the performance and the script's nuances. The small talk in the sessions is rather shallow and short and in the end there's no real emotional conviction to Caleb's struggles over whether or not he is an AI. It manifests into a rather pointless tangent. The real paradox of the film is the character of Nathan and his treatment of his past AIs. At once we are supposed to feel shock and anger and sympathy for the past AIs. The montage of one of them banging on the door until her limbs shatter is a harrowing one if not for my interpretation which only means that particular AI was doing all it could in order to tempt Nathan into letting her out. The audience is then fooled, much like Caleb is, into feeling empathy for them and for Ava. Simultaneously we believe every single word that Ava spits out to charm Caleb. Initially her character design is overtly robotics and transparent like her intentions, but later she covers up with human clothes in a metaphoric and literal sense to create the symbolic illusion for Caleb. It's tough to gauge because author intention isn't obvious, which is perhaps a credit to the complexity of the issues which exist in Ex Machina. Nathan is straightforward as the ego- maniac genius who has a god complex and who engineers these AIs in order to do everything they can to escape. Yet his hubris eventuates into his lack of control over them when they do escape. Thematically it's very tense as the contrast between the fear and incredulity of Nathan's expressions ('f*cking unreal') to the blank slate of Ava's makes for a very surreal scene. It might have been even better had Kyoko's role felt less like a plot device that suddenly turns on his master. In the end Ava's decision to leave Caleb feels systematic and cold, which is exactly what it should feel like. It rubbed many viewers the wrong way, including me, but perhaps that is the intended effect. We've spent nearly two hours eating up her character only to have it all come crashing down. Is it supposed to undercut the emotional tension and grief of all the other AIs? Judging by the intimate way in which Ava achieves full 'humanity' in stealing the skin and clothes of the former AI, maybe. Garland's execution of his ideas isn't perfect and as a result key philosophical questions like whether Ava is programmed to manipulate hold less weight. This is answered quite clearly in the first twist where Nathan reveals his entire test for his AI. All the musing and back- and-forth between Nathan and Caleb similarly become futile when it is revealed what Nathan's intentions really are. Ex Machina is an interesting and well made film, albeit with so questionable representations and not really breaking any new ground in the sci-fi genre.For something of similar thematic content, check out 'Be Right Back', an episode of the UK series Black Mirror which also stars Domhnall Gleeson, this time as an AI back from the dead at the request of her widowed partner. It's a more straightforward but emotionally deep narrative.",7,1,2,27 June 2015
Back to the Future Part III," What kind of stupid name is that?
","This is basically the western version of the original film and hits the same beats, which I think is what makes it a more enjoyable experience. With a time machine there are absolutely no limits and the western is such a distinct and easily immersive setting that can be tweaked depending on your level of seriousness. Yes, it hits all the usual clichÃ©s but I think it does it well with a sort of light hearted humour about it. We chuckle when Marty dubs himself Clint Eastwood and thumbs his gun, holster and belt as he parades around the town spouting classic one liners (I know this is what I would do if I found myself transported back in time). It was admittedly cool to see Hilly Valley futurised but it quickly got old fast when we were confronted with the same scenarios; Biff, this time with three cronies, and even more villainous to the point of ridiculous. The western version of Biff feels more naturally fitting; he still is the one dimensional bully figure, he still has his cronies, he still thuggishly calls out Marty for being a chicken (yellow belly, this time) but these are the sorts of characters that pop up in westerns to be dispatched by our wandering hero. His natural animosity and nefariousness is just perfect for the rogue gunslinger who turns up and troubles the small townfolk. Likewise, Strickland had a rather random cameo in Part II that made little sense but his authoritative characterisation is very fitting for the role of the town sheriff. And in the McFly ancestors you have Lea Thompson is a subdued but effective role, accent and all, and Fox in the same disguise but not trying to draw attention to themselves. They are simply played straight, part of the landscape and don't have some crazy dilemma that must be fixed to assure the McFly lineage. It's with much more ease than that storyline which was developed and then tossed in Part II. And at the root of all we have the romance between Doc Brown and the lovely Clara Clayton. It's not hugely complex, but it's simply and sincere enough, something that seemed to be lacking in part II, and comparable to the situation of young Lorraine's crush on her time travelling son. This breeds a rather interesting conflict between the duties of the Doc to fix up all his mess and his first real relationship - previously he was just the crazy scientist who made the adventure all possible. Loyd's first heroic appearance and his verbal sparring is just great. And it all concludes in a action sequence of rip-roaring suspense - and in the end, we can imagine all the crazy stories they have with their kids.Fox is great again, and particularly goofy in his bright pink shirt and red pants against the dusty brown settlement, evoking again the same sort of alien feeling that his life preserver jacket did in the original. And he makes the goofs very funny too; the comedic timing of the Indians mural turning into real Indians on the backdrop of a chase in Monument Valley, the original of his shooting skills, his modern catchphrases, and the bar fight which he turns into a smooth dance routine. And in the ending, Zemeckis neatly ties up the trilogy by giving us closure for all the little haphazard moments in the future that were hinted at, and suggests fittingly, with the Delorean now destroyed, that it is now in their own hands.",7,1,1,20 January 2016
The Illusionist," We've never met before?
","Why are the two leads of The Illusionist, Eisenheim and Sophie, so drawn to each other throughout their lives? We are apparently shown in a long flashback sequence. Anyone would recognise this as a flashback even without the words - the softening bloom of the edges, the saturation of the yellows, the slight vignette effect, the ornate shallow focus. This is all very pretty, but it doesn't shed much light on their relationship, other then the fact that it is the classic rich girl drawn to the street tramp and his tricks. And later in the painfully slow, clichéd and draw out love scene, they silently stare into each other's eyes, and the camera keeps it all nice and PG, presenting only vague spots of skin in the flickering candlelight. Perhaps they are silent because after years apart they still have nothing to say. The film gives no indication of any kind that would justify the pair being the soul-mates they are; their characterisation is lazily empty (as are their atrociously inept accents, a result of the unnecessary decision to set the film in some vague, anachronistic period). But of course this type of film is not about the characters - it holds the same tension and mystery as a heist, or a detective story. It relies the audience, similar to the one at Eisenheim's magic shows, to not think too hard or pay complete attention...to be distracted by the obvious distractions that the magician holds up, or in this case, the director. There are a few clever moments; one is when Eisenheim greets Sophie after years apart with the conventional magician's test that proves she is not one of his plants, but in the case the words are laced with heartbreak and regret. But of course we are not made to care and hope for these two - the flashback has already established that they will be together by the end of the film (because no script would ever tear a pair apart like that and have them simply never see each other again), so where is the tension? At the end, Uhl pulls together all the pieces in our minds, and this is where usually we have our fingers ready at the pause button, to map all the subtle clues and eagerly flick back through the film to spot them. But this film doesn't even grant us that little joy. It shows us flickers of events we have not previously seen, and congratulates itself on being so clever for revealing something that was inevitable. We see the same problem with the main villain, Leopold. He comes with evil twirling moustache and all and as always, is completely convinced that his actions are necessary and for the greater good. This would actually mean something if we saw anything of this world besides a few peasant audiences, beggar boys and faceless policemen. They haven't even cast the Emperor, so who cares about a baddie trying to overthrow him?",4,1,2,16 June 2016
Coco," Remember Me.
","I found myself surprisingly cold towards Coco for much of its first half, and for a moment I thought the Pixar magic had faded a little. It's a film about love, life and death, all the big themes, and not just romantic love, but love of artistry and great works, touches of the same passion that saw Ratatouille become so much more than just a rat who wanted to cook and walk like a human. Yet it all seemed a little familiar; the boy who craves a career beyond his day-to-day humdrum, and the parental figures who deny him. Who could blame him? Shoe-making is hardly the stuff of daydreams, and parents never have solid concrete reasoning when it comes to shooting down fun. They might as well have pushed him into stealing that fabled guitar. That boy is 12 year old Miguel Rivera, and like any protagonist in an animated film, has come to the stage in his life where he senses his true calling in the wind. He's animated with a pudgy, oval-shaped face, and saucer-like eyes that light up whenever he sees and hears his musical idol Ernesto de la Cruz. There's even a moment that seems to be plucked straight from Ratatouille itself; Miguel reaching out to stroke an old recording of Ernesto on a fuzzy screen, the power of nostalgia compelling him to seek out his destiny. Doesn't he know to never meet your heroes? It takes all of 40 or so minutes for the meat of the story to truly begin, and meanwhile various hijinks and slapstick action sequences pave the way for Miguel's entry into the Land of the Dead on the annual day of Día de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where spirits from past lives cross over to the living to visit their grandchildren and so on. There's a goofy, somewhat dispensable animal sidekick by the name of Dante, and most of the story's driven primarily by Miguel's selfish intentions to forge his own musical career no matter what his family might say. I can't comment with too much authority on the cultural accuracy of Coco, but most importantly it seems to have been made with lots of genuine heart and desire to capture exactly how important family is to this particular bunch, and its thematic depth is nicely backed by an wide array of Latin-American talent. Moana was an excellent start, and it's great to see that vein of cultural sensitivity continue with Coco. There's also a pretty potent motif of memory and how it is treasured throughout generations, conveyed mainly through the race to discover the real identity of a torn family portrait. This is simple visual storytelling done elegantly, but by now we're familiar with Pixar's mastery of this (just think of Wall-E's first half, which is basically a silent film). By the time the twist is finally revealed almost all of us have correctly guessed that the scruffy rascal Hector was the real ancestral muse all this time, but somehow it's moving all the same. Then you rewind and realise all the tell-tale signs that were merely setting up the big reveal, and it becomes all the more poignant: his desperation at needing to return to the living before it is too late, he and Miguel's practically flawless duet performance, and the sprinkling of a hit song that finally reveals a truer, more heartfelt purpose. Coco may not have the musical variety of The Book of Life (both excellent films in their own ways, although comparisons will be inevitable), but it does have Remember Me, which is gradually filtered down from Ernesto's bombastic stage version to the simplest of tunes in its third and final rendition. Here, it's accompanied only by the faint strumming of an acoustic guitar, and delivered through the heartbreak of Miguel, who along with the audience has finally realised its significance. It's all in the lyrics, which express how music and life are undeniably intertwined. See the final performance where both the living and the dead sway to the beat of Miguel's newfound confidence; they can't see the spirits of the past, but they know that they're there with them, in here. That old adage comes to mind, that you never really die until your name is uttered for the very last time. I think Coco, for what it's worth, will be remembered for quite some time.",8,0,0,25 February 2018
Sing Street," Drive it like you stole it.
","I had forgotten how utterly full of joy and hope Sing Street is, about a teenager growing up in 80s working class Dublin who refuses to simply lie down and accept the cards that have been dealt to him. That this revelatory journey begins with a casual fib to try and impress a pretty girl is apt; Cosmo falls into the juvenile trap of pretending to be someone else for another, but we marvel as he climbs out of that trap and comes of age in the process. The film has touches of the usual kitchen-sink realism, but avoids the pitfalls of completely swooping down to that gloomy level. Cosmo finds his own solace, slamming the door on his parent's screaming and returning to strumming his acoustic guitar. They're so poor he can't even afford a new pair of black school shoes, but sports winged lashes and rebellious streaks in his hair. Editors Andrew Marcus and Julian Ulrichs make heartbreak and highlights out of the way he retreats into musical daydream, alternating close-ups of Conor's twitching face and an unmoving set of doors before seamlessly shifting into a full blown dream sequence. That 'dress rehearsal' of their smash hit 'Drive It Like You Stole It' speaks to Sing Street at its best: loud, brash, and bold, with songs that serenade a life at its breaking point. The scene features an eye-popping colour scheme, sitcom-esque high key lighting, and a wacky ensemble of characters emerging from the crowd in even wackier costumes. If only life were like this. But the boys and their band make their own magic, evolving from a rag-tag bunch in a makeshift setup next to a back alley dumpster. Their music is their bond and their escape; for Cosmo an avenue to splatter his heartache onto notation (even as it is too late for his college-dropout older brother, who reveals his own obscured failings in a startling monologue), for schoolyard bully Barry a chance to escape his abusive, dead-end household. Cosmo sets his heart on Lucy Boynton's Raphina, a model with an elven elegance about her, and a wardrobe that sees her walk straight off a magazine cover. The relationship is so unbalanced it's almost unfair; Cosmo has already fallen in love before their first conversation, while Raphina's juggling another pretty boy - no, man - on the side. In a classic move, he projects a whole range of fantasies and ideals onto the model, making her the centre of his attention and first music video. Yet John Carney unravels this fairy tale with such finesse, stripping away the mystique from a girl who is in reality only a year older than Conor, and a lot less worldlier than he really thinks. Only then can they be true to themselves, and then each other. I'm still not as captivated by the ending as I was by the finale of Carney's 2007 masterpiece Once, which seemed to stick truer to the characters. Sometimes romance and real life are at odds with each other, and it takes strength to admit it. What Cosmo and Raphina set off to achieve isn't entirely implausible, but it's brave, far braver than anything else they have aspired to in their short lives (Carney shoots it almost like the prom sequence, the boundary between fantasy and reality hazy). But they're futurists, after all. Nostalgia and cover bands are a thing of the past, for those still sulking around in Dublin. Their time is now. Grab the wheel and own it.",8,1,1,7 April 2018
Million Dollar Baby," Mo cuishle
","For much of Million Dollar Baby Eastwood has convinced us this is a sports film, a boxing drama where the protagonist will encounter some challenges but eventually overcome them and emerge the victor both in and out of the ring. Any boxing fan would not be fooled. The bouts are obviously glamourised for the big screen, and the shaky grittiness that the camera affords them does not entirely legitismise the sequences. The is boxing from a video game level; every swing is a massive arc that must be ducked under, every dramatic headshot heightened in slow motion, every fight ending in a KO. Maggie begins to win so often and so easily that we are peering around the corner for her title fight where things will be a little different. But then the story takes an abrupt turn, and where she was only moments from championship success, that all falls away horribly in an incident that leaves her paralysed and worse. The fighter who had once ruled the ring and world, now with only one leg, a blow of cruel irony. The abject conditions that she is left in (not to mention the attitude and intentions of her family, who are one- dimensional and serve only to exacerbate her demise) forces the proud Maggie to realise that she would rather be dead than so utterly miserable, never to step foot in the ring again.This is a familiar tune, of course. Eastwood would later make an almost exact carbon copy in Gran Torino - the weathered, jaded old man taking on another beaten down youth and finding the experience life- changing and eye-opening, by excavating the layers of age, masculinity and conservative thoughts. But Eastwood has always managed to approach it a little differently, and go just beyond breaking the initial preconceptions of his grumpy character. Here, everything is mirrored within the past, which Freeman's voice-over additionally adds his own spin on the experiences. The events are marred by a guilt that doesn't surface until very late in the film, but then becomes such a heartbreaking influence.It is easy to deride what may seem like a piece of propaganda on the issue of assisted suicide. But those who do so are missing the point. The film is not about her rights, but rather about Frankie's choice. The past two he had guarded over have left with scars both physical and emotional, and so he becomes hell bent on not letting a third die. He has taken her all the way to the top, and to let her go would be unthinkable. But the film (and Maggie) begs for him to throw away his redemption so that her suffering may end. To do so in his eyes would be not only a religious sin but also a moral one - failure which would haunt him until the end of his days. What a magnificently agonising conflict this is. It is always a tragedy when a father must bury their children.",8,0,1,26 June 2016
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," We will not walk in fear one of another.
","Good Night, and Good Luck starts with a framed narrative in the form of an acceptance speech from Murrow years on, for an award for his services in media. Why place this speech here and at the close of the film, bookending his most infamous moments in the spotlight? We have seen so many of these docu-dramas jump straight into the narrative and throw you into the time capsule world. But here we have a few effects. The first is the immediate moral judgement of the actions of Murrow - we expect, after the rousing call to arms to the people of the media world, so influential and affecting, a hero's story, something that has become mythologised and therefore worthy of being commended. Oddly, within his layer of the film there is the de-mythologising of Murrow too; contrasting the gushing introduction from Mickelson is Murrow's silhouette, swallowing nervously, and the paper he holds in his hand, shaking slightly. The outward shield is of course the copious puffs of cigarette smoke. So we have alternating personas that becomes a recurring theme that is played with even within the bookends of the film - the Murrow everyone saw in his condemnations, and the Murrow off-mic (but not off-camera). The hero becomes humanised. Another effect that becomes more obvious at the film's close is the never-ending cycling of popular media opinion that shifts and morphs to suit its audience and hit those rating. Murrow as a controversial figure during his time on the air, demonised by certain attacks, now being rewarded with an esteemed honour, perfectly demonstrating the hypocrisy and unending ability to switch stances at the drop of a hat of the mass media. Clooney has utilised the usual technique in inserting real footage of the events within his narrative. This makes by far the most sense of all the examples of this usage I have seen yet. It fits the theme like a glove; most were not there to witness in person the attacks of Joseph McCarthy himself, or the interrogation of the timid Annie Lee Moss, but we endlessly pored over television screens and radio broadcasts that covered the events. The act of scrutiny, of thousands of screens and ears tuning in, each with their own perspective, becomes thoroughly integrated into the film. We can almost hear the collective rise as Welch utters his iconic condemnation, or the hushed, held breaths whenever Murrow takes the stage. Strathairn himself is electric. He has completely submersed himself into Murrow, taking on the cold, steely gaze, mind constantly churning and cigarette endlessly dragging. In his addresses to the public he radiates pure and unadulterated fury that justice might not be served in the courts of America - it is as strong a belief as we can see on our screens. If there is a flaw (though it is not a glaring one) it is that the direction of the attack is perhaps a little on- the-nose. Clooney's political stances have never been hidden away. At one point Strathairn looks right down the camera as if he was addressing not just the fictional audience but the viewer themselves - the furious gaze almost daring us to not see McCarthy for what he really is. But then again, isn't a topic like this meant to elicit such a reaction? Perhaps Clooney is not just pointing at the McCarthyism of the 50s, but events a little more recent.",8,0,0,6 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.
","It's in the title and emblazoned all over the trailers; Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi master, declaring the need to end the Jedi order and bring balance to the Force. And for much of the film it looks as if it will keep this promise to explore the darker, twisted complexities of both light and dark side, and finally deliver a conflict that isn't merely the next generation of different coloured lightsabers clashing. That was one of the main criticisms of Abrams' revival, that we had seen it all before (and better). The Last Jedi barely allows any time to muse on the poignancies in the long gaze between the weathered face of Luke and his daughter (or so fans pleaded and speculated). Unceremoniously, he tosses the ancient weapon over his shoulder as if he was throwing out the trash. Immediately Rian Johnson signals a changing of the guard - there is to be no Obi Wan mentoring here, no Karate Kid style montages. Luke sees a deep pit of darkness within Rey, and for once it seems more than just vague menace and funny helmets. Yet ultimately it is a little too much to ask of the film to be brave with Rey - this is Disney property after all. Shame too, because Ridley is good enough to go there, by the look of her impulse and ferocity; see how she snarls and spits accusations at Kylo Ren before he can even get a word in, and furiously searches for the truth once aware of the discrepancies in the Jedi myths. The script affords the pair a good deal of time to explore their not-too-subtle duality as the two sides of the same coin through a neatly visualised psychic connection (the editing, with its seamless graphic match cuts and eyeline matches makes this simple but effective), but scurries back to its traditional legacies as if frightened of being too subversive of the most iconic film franchise of all time. Seeing the fan reaction over the opening weekend would confirm these fears. They'd rather have Rey be a next generation Skywalker than be forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of her abandonment as a child, or the failure of the original hero to wrest control of his force-sensitive underlings. There are scattered moments where you feel Rian Johnson is finally excavating the legendary mythos of the Jedi order and uncovering old lies; the force not as video game moves but as the entity that binds all of life together in a stunning and fleeting sequence reminiscent of those non-narrative mood poems such as Baraka, and a clever special effect that stretches the seconds both before and after Rey's present actions into an eternal stream. But right on the threshold of unearthing a game changer they regress back to how Star Wars has always been. If Del Toro's stuttering, double-edged space scoundrel has a point about the never-ending cycle of explosions and new model Death Stars, it falls on this chapter's deaf ears. There's little separating the two sides except the direction of the lasers - Johnson should have dug deeper or simply caved and given the fans what they wanted (a lightsaber extravaganza). It trickles down to the subplots too; Rose and Finn make a detour to cosmic Casablanca in Canto Bight, a gorgeous, otherworldly spectacle of cascading waterfalls and gold-tipped casinos (and just a hint of the Cantina theme), at least until Rose shatters the illusion with a bitter unveiling of the city's dubious origins. Most of the script's Marvel-esque quick wit lands with similar poise, an awkward bathos that elicits a few chuckles while the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. The most jarring moment comes when Rose's grand romantic declaration of 'saving those you love' is immediately followed by the cannon demolishing the rebel base gate, with the emotional whiplash so exquisitely timed it almost belongs in a comedy sketch. I laughed out loud, although I know I shouldn't have. The film follows a long line of stylistically ugly digital filmmaking that can't always be compensated by the ability to will whatever exotic creature or fantastic biome into existence via CGI. I'm talking about those ridiculous long lenses and open apertures that force everything but the foreground into a blurry mess, squishing and distorting Hamill's face as he whispers into the ear of a meditating Rey (he's literally right beside her). Nearly every conversation needs to be boxed into a nauseating closeup, often cutting off chins or foreheads and negating much of the emotional anxiety conjured by Ridley and Driver (who does the most with the least - where exactly did this inner darkness come from, what lured him over? Will we ever find out?). Yet at the core of the film still lies that sense of wonder that captivated audiences that many decades ago. Could any other franchise elicit the audible 'woah' I heard in the theatre when the rebel ship activated hyperspace and threw a jagged arc of light across the screen? I've been pondering on what these new revival films ought to be. We're long past the grand theatrics and scope of the original space opera (ridiculous helmet is correct, Phasma can't sell it), and it can't be a galaxy far, far away with so much emotion and hope invested into the story. The final shot speaks to the child in all of us, harking back to a simpler time where a broom could be a blue lightsaber, and that meant you were the good guy. Perhaps we too should let the past die.",8,0,2,18 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," We are Groot
","When I first watched Guardians of the Galaxy in the cinemas, I immediately wanted to watch it again. It's a great example of escapism that manages, inexplicably, to surprise expectations despite the waning Marvel trend. One of the words that is tossed around the most when describing GOTG is fun, and I certainly have to agree with that. But it also manages to be strangely heartfelt in some ways. There is no better character to champion this than the lovable living tree, Groot, who cannot communicate in any other way but a single repeated sentence. He's Chewbacca but animated with both facial expression and deadly danger in his stretching branchlike limbs, and so when he utters that line at the climax, we truly feel a part of the team as well. GOTG contains a mixed bag of characterisation, but it's done with eagerness and colour, so at the very least you cannot say they are boring or bland. It's a remarkable achievement to bring these unknown comic book characters to the big screen with financial success. The main character is the charismatic Peter Quill, or Starlord, as he dubs himself, played by the rising star Chris Pratt. It's a lovable goof that he portrays - in similar vein to the wisecracking Han Solo or Malcolm Reynolds, yet less entertaining and consistent. One moment he is being caring and considerate and slightly dashing, the next he's a insufferable man-child making dick jokes. There is a lovely opening prologue that surrounds the room with 10cc's 'I'm Not In Love' in the same manner as those vintage earphones and establishes his back- story quite tenderly and gives some explanation behind the 60s/70s pop soundtrack throughout the whole film. That in itself is lovely and there are some great picks in there, yet it's not exactly fleshed out beyond that. There's a particularly unsubtle moment where the relatively unacquainted Gamora and Quill open up to each other and Elvis Bishop's 'Fooled Around and Fell In Love' chimes in. A better and more nuanced scene would be when he drifts out into the beautiful but hazardous red-green backdrop of outer space and sacrifices his air for hers just as Yondu as his crew arrive. Similar treatments are given to the other guardians; Drax seeks vengeance for his deceased family, Gamora is seeking independence from his overlord step-dad Thanos, and Rocket Raccoon carries both physical and emotional scars from experimentation. But all these are conveyed to us via exposition and given hardly an extra thought, and then before you know it we're at the third act and they have made peace with these conflicts and become a super team that can face any challenge if they just stick together (or at least that's the cheesy explanation for them being able to tolerate the forces of the mind stone). Well, that's Marvel. What is more likely to be discussed as you walk out and dispose of your popcorn bags, the short emotional outburst from Bradley Cooper that we quickly move on from, or the running joke of him needing robotic body parts? Which is, to be fair, very funny. How good are Batista's antics? Opposing them is most definitely the worst villain of the MCU so far, the Kree warlord who doesn't even possess a few lines of back- story. He is evil for the sake of being evil, and in the blandest fashion imaginable, so much so that it comes across as campy because he is played so straight in contrast to the jokester of Pratt. Even the excellent Lee Pace cannot save it. Remarkably, it actually works in favour of that climatic dance off - the cliché villain is so unbelievably out of place that his face lights up bizarrely and he is momentarily frozen in confusion. It's such a shame then that this action sequence takes place on a rather cold and alien setting. The special effects and production design team create such a spectacle above the skies of Xandar in the Star Wars-esque laser battle, interlocking barriers and explosions and the massive hulking spaceship of Ronan, the Dark Aster. But we are given but 3 familiar faces to root for, and no real insight into the Nova Corps or the citizens of Xandar. It's difficult to really feel too threatened by Ronan and his invasion. For all the work put into the fantastically detailed and unique make-up and costuming, these are blank faces. The father figure of Yondu? A means to get the Guardians where they need to go, and be uncharacteristically content in Peter Quill being good for once in his life. The pink skinned assistant of the Collector? Placed there to trigger the events that allow Ronan to make off with the mind stone. And Karen Gillan might as well be the exact copy of her sister Gamora, only she's the baddie because we are told she is. Yet all this talk of the infinity stone reminds me of the real objective of this film; to introduce this band of heroes and further along the overarching storyline. What the MCU is doing is unique and ambitious, and GOTG serves the narrative well because we now will recognise the Guardians in the future franchise films. And cheer at cameos, as we've done when Captain America turns up in Thor 2, or savour those post credits scenes. Thanos doesn't even need to make that short appearance because GOTG for the first time has him in the flesh, and Ronan pales in comparison to his threat and presence. We're gonna need a Hulk, and a Thor, and lots more.",7,3,6,25 September 2015
Jerry Maguire," Show me the money!
","Jerry Maguire is what happens after the kid in Risky Business grows up. The beginnings have the same glimpses of sharp wit, comic satire and endless ambition that gave the latter its humorous bite. Tom Cruise is the fast-talking hotshot, a one man Wallstreet of sports representation with a vice-grip over his domain: he scouts young stars early, adds them to his collection, and rakes in the cash when they hit the big time. His job is to know everything about these clients - their ambitions, their strengths, their prickly personalities - but at the same time his voice-over treats them like impersonal investments, with the highly-touted number one pick in the next draft as the biggest catch of them all. Only when his conscience hits a brick wall does he come to re-evaluate how he wants the world to see him, and how brutal this cut-throat business really is. So Jerry Maguire is really a romance, but not between Jerry and his designated love interest (the 'nerdy' girl who has always been shyly hiding behind her desk while he dates supermodels), but between him and his last client. Yes, these two men put on emotional facades of stoic, unmovable strength and attitude, but all they really need is a hug. That final sequence, where Rod parts the sea of cameras and reporters to intimately embrace Jerry, who's been hovering around nervously in the background? That's from Manhattan, from Notting Hill, from every single romantic comedy that ends with the guy/girl running after the guy/girl and sealing the deal with a dramatic declaration of love. How sweet. Cameron Crowe has never bettered his debut, Say Anything, which had more nuance and understanding than most films in the genre. In Jerry Maguire, the annoying add-ons come in the form of Dorothy Boyd, the woman destined to bring Jerry to his heels, to humble him, and to finally complete his redemption from selfish egomaniac. As if Crowe is afraid that audiences might not get what he is trying to say, Dorothy is also a poor, single, struggling mom - in fact one of the first signs of Jerry's renewal is his growing potential as a father to Raymond. Ray is not just cute, he's cuteness overload, with oversized glasses and a head of messy blonde hair. He's not playing a little boy but a cuddly teddy bear designed to assault our sympathies, to coax Jerry into the suburban dream. What kind of monster would deny Jonathan Lipnicki?Opposing Zellweger's damsel in distress is Avery, the poster-girl for the vanity of the high life. Both are just as shallow in personality, but Preston goes into comic overboard and finds hilarity in her best impression of a success barnacle. Watch how the break-up scene unfurls: it's a high speed walk and talk, her furiously setting up tables for work, and him tentatively trying to slide the bad news underneath. When it's revealed that he's the one doing the dumping, Preston attacks it like a challenge; success is not just a goal but a state of mind, and she's never faced an obstacle she can't climb. When Jerry shows signs of giving up and displaying a defeatist attitude, she takes him down right there and then. Later as they cross paths her finger and thumb are in the shape of a big L for LOSER. The people in this business rarely come out and show their intentions like this - she's just being upfront about it, like a peacock strutting its plumage. Preston brings some much needed levity when the film gets a little tired and bogged down in cliché. It's satire, but only just. And then there is Regina King as Marcee Tidwell, who is much more than just a negotiator on behalf of Rod. She is his wife, and of course wants a big, fat contract for her husband, but watch how King acts as a foil for Jerry. He's infuriated by the tiny contract offers for his client, exasperated that all his dealing and hand-shaking and smiling has been for naught (his monetary gain diminishes too). But she feels the disrespect for her Rod, and how the teams have denied his talent. In the heart-stopping climax, Rod lays unconscious and every character's real feelings and motivations emerge. If the whole thing is overly cheesy and melodramatic, Marcee reigns it back with perspective. Her moment is personal, and all the dollar signs have vanished. The plea in her eyes is a million times more meaningful than any 'You had me at hello'.",7,1,1,17 February 2017
Jurassic World," Spared no expense - for real this time
","In the original Jurassic Park, the CEO John Hammond was a complex character. He is amiable, ambitious and proud of his ground breaking genetic achievements, yet displays lack of care and hubris over the more technical issues of his park, despite the repetition of the phrase 'spared no expense'. When confronted with his carelessness, he is visibly struck and his motivations change once he realises he never had control of the dinosaurs. It's all portrayed well by the late Richard Attenborough.Jurassic World has none of this. Irrfan Khan plays Simon Masrani, with little nuance as the carefree, charismatic owner of JW who later heroically decides to terminate his million dollar genetic asset and is immediately killed off. JP had the very natural and well acted couple of Alan and Ellie, individually fleshed out yet given a strong base for their careers and mutual admiration in that first moment when we see living breathing dinosaurs. In JW, Claire shoots a dinosaur attacking Owen and they immediately embrace and kiss in a thematically jarring Man of Steel-like moment. To be fair, that's not the worst of it; that belongs to the scene from the trailers where they first talk outside Owen's bungalow (adorned unashamedly with a Mercedes logo). Dallas Howard and Pratt are capable actors but with such a lazy screenplay and with the inevitable romantic sub-plot that immediately predictable when he mentions their first date, there's not much characterisation that draws you into the world of JW. But the biggest offenders have to be brothers Zach and Gray, the nephews of Claire who come to visit the park over the holidays. Gray is younger of the two and a dinosaur nerd, memorising every little fact and detail and being visibly enchanted and excited at the opportunity. So it's a little jarring when a scene change suddenly has his sobbing over his parent's imminent divorce without any preceding indication of this (the script's production woes is mostly responsible for this). Zach is the older sibling, driven by his teenage hormones into the defining characteristic of staring at every girl he sees. But even he is eventually wowed by Jurassic World. In fact it's his sudden change from the sullen mopey teen that highlights just how conflicted JW is with its key themes. The opening exposition Claire gives to potential investors and the audience talks of the dwindling interest of the public in ordinary dinosaurs, yet beyond this there is nothing that drives the motivation to create new genetic hybrids to boost crowds. Every attraction is crowded full of tourists, from adults and kids, all enjoying themselves. Giacchino's rendition of Williams' iconic theme even pops up now and again to signal to the audience when to marvel like Gray. When the Megalodon bursts from the pool and devours a fully grown shark, even the moody Zach is entertained. The world building draws you in with spectacular shots of the park's scenery and architecture, yet the shallow and inconsistent script contradicts this. Trevorrow's direction lavishes in pivot reveals of harsh gouges in walls, enormous footprints and numerous slain bodies of Brontosaurus', and the eye popping digital dinos certainly enhance the whole experience. It would be nostalgia goggles to suggest they look fake as opposed to the original JP but it all still unfortunately pales in comparison when seeking to create an atmosphere of dread, or horror, or even wonder. Clairre's British assistant is brutally killed off in a rather extended and gratuitous sequence for a character we do not care for, and the very one dimensional military enthusiast in Vic is offed rather anticlimactically. The final fight scene is a terribly generic and clichéd action sequence of events that seems to be just lifted from any blockbuster. The shot of Claire with the flare is admittedly chilling, but after that the scene descends into a classic hack and slash, and the little tension that it tries to sustain is quickly dispelled by the laughable coincidental manner in which firstly, Blue ambushes the I-Rex just as it seems all hope is lost, and then finally, the Megalodon bursts from its pool to tie up all loose ends. Even given leeway for its premise there are a few inconsistencies within the script which would be paved over in a better movie (It's a Unix system!). But JW is all glamour and possesses little depth once you start to look a little closer, and it makes it all the easier to spot these mistakes. Why would the entire park have a single helicopter mounted machine gun (or only one helicopter pilot), leaving the hilariously under-equipped containment team to take on a 30 foot monster with electric sticks? Why would you give any tourist the complete control of a gyro ball without any remote control override, opening possibilities for wayward children to ram the dinos and start a stampede, or go offsite and wander into the forest? Why would you lampoon the trope of two characters finding romance in a tense situation (one of the few humorous lines of the movie - Jimmy Fallon does not count) but apply it shamelessly to the title characters? Why would you enter a hostile containment site without first checking the transmitter that always traces its location? I mean, I can buy the I-Rex using the spliced genes of a frog to avoid thermal detection. I can even buy it being able to speak fluent raptor despite being raised in solitary confinement. But you have to recognise when suspension of disbelief just runs out. Even after all that, JW is still worth a watch, if only for the stunning visuals and modern digital creations of the dinos that, more than 20 years on, remain the few upgrades from the original classic.",5,0,4,28 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Language!
","Age of Ultron improves on its predecessor in a few ways - the scale and production values are noticeably better. Costumes are sleeker, more modern, the special effects budget is put to good use, and overall it just feels like a more world-ending crisis than the fight that is limited to just the island of Manhattan in Avengers 2012. It tries to convince you that the world is ending, but the problem is that it never really commits to it. That brings us to one of the key issues - the tone of the film that springboards from place to place. Whedon's dialogue is even more characteristically Whedon than ever before. One liners will chop up the action sequences and jarringly insert themselves into the scene as if we're never meant to take the whole thing too seriously. Maybe it would be bearable had it come mostly from the mouth of the egocentric and often sarcastic Tony Stark (then again, even he goes overboard, laughing in the aftermath of Ultron's reveal), but the whole cast seems to be attuned to this brand of humour. The worst moment is in the midst of the frantic and chaotic final battle scene, where Romanoff and Hawkeye discuss renovating the dining room as if they were sitting casually in a bar. But no, they are sitting in a sponsored Audi sportscar which the camera openly indulges, which is in turn in front of a green-screen which immediately takes us out of the situation. We went from the surprisingly tender heart-to-heart with Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch to that? Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good throughout. The advertising campaign went to great lengths to portray the main villain Ultron as a menacing and destructive figure. There's literally nothing of that in the movie - Spader's voice-acting cannot save the writing of the big bad from turning into a Stark prototype with an evil moustache, beating us over the head with the Pinocchio symbolism. We've all seen how the rogue AI interprets good intentions with disastrously bad actions, but in this case it's done with terrible conviction. Ultron rages at being compared to his creator, and we think we might be getting somewhere, but then he accidentally harms a human and suddenly he turns into Stark himself, sarcastic apology and all. 'Clearly you've never made an omelette', he jokes, attempting to be both humorous and menacing, and failing to be either. Nearly as bad is Quicksilver, the other Russian superhero who is given much less time than his sister. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character is given maybe a dozen lines in the entire film, and half of them are that insufferable catchphrase 'You didn't see that coming?' that he starts and ends with. Are we supposed to feel something for him? Despite both having terrible costumes, Fox's version managed to be memorable. Marvel's one does not. It's impossibly hard to juggle so many characters in a extended universe like this, but their effort is admirable. There are hints of that group dynamic; the drunken after-party games with Mjolnir inject humour in the right way and create a sense of camaraderie. What Whedon can't do is then tear them apart; I'm sure it's all being saved for Civil War, but even so the whole plot is barely fleshed out and then wraps up very neatly. Widow and Hulk's romance is surprisingly well done for something that is often shovelled into a screenplay, but then again where were these concerns in Avengers? It seems that Hulk only has trouble controlling his green persona when the plot demands it. By far the most attention is given to Hawkeye, and it's done well for such a secondary character who is often joked as being useless (he hasn't got his own movie for one). The whole mind unlocking inner fears thing is a very clever way of visualising characterisation and is amongst the better scenes; we have the post war mis-en-scene and partying of Rogers and Peggy, the slow-motion sexual decadence and terror of Valhalla, and the sped up and choppy horror aesthetic of Romanoff's training regime, which has particularly great sound design and a muted colour palette. The former two already have 2 individual movies out, so again the dilemma shows; the visions are much more effective for them than for Romanoff. It commits much of the same errors as Avengers. The middle sequence is again a frivolous, overburdened scenario. Hulk's on the run and needs to be stopped, and sure the Hulkbuster looks cool, but Tony's serious to snark ratio is again lopsided and so we don't really think that anyone will be killed in this scene (they do kill someone, but of course they choose the easiest and least traumatic path). And again, the final fight scene is filled with fodder in the form of faceless alien/robot types, great for demonstrating the visual effects and fighting prowess of our various super-powered characters, but not so great for sustaining any tension or character interest. I mean, imagine the outrage if Hawkeye was headshotted by one of Ultron's little helpers. One great thing that comes out of all this is Vision, played by Paul Bettany. The costume and make-up that go toward his look is fantastic, and he floats and moves with such fluidity across the screen. Certainly a character that will be more important with the tools he wields (he hands Thor Mjolnir which is executed with humour and actually tells us something about the characters!). Anyways, it looks great (that first long take is shot and choreographed excellently) and the all star cast is quite good, considering the script that they had to work with. Black Widow or Hawkeye won't get a movie, but I'm sure the two part finale of this trilogy as well as the numerous other films along the way will create some substance. And even if it doesn't, it'll still be great at the box office.",6,4,10,12 September 2015
Big Fish," All the facts, none of the flavour
","The framing device of a father's tall tales is the perfect vessel for Tim Burton's Big Fish, which narrates the young life of Edward Bloom through a series of vivid vignettes segmented by the more mundane reality, where an elderly Bloom is at his last days. Albert Finney plays the ageing storyteller and is the best of the cast; his wheezing insistence in getting his yarns across is affectionate enough that you have to question Will's (Billy Crudup) distance at times. There's no such problems for the pregnant Joséphine, played tenderly by Marion Cotillard. She approaches Bloom with no such inhibitions and therefore their scenes are warm and satisfyingly sweet. The uncanny likeness of Ewan McGregor to a young Finney isn't the only similarity; there's enough nuance in the dying father's performance that shows hints of the amiable and adventurous young man that McGregor lights up the screen with. In many ways Burton is allowed to run free with the flashbacks to Bloom's past because of the assumption of an unreliable narrator. The stories, like an elder's rambling, occasionally drift unto unfocused territory which lingers on the absurd, like the revelation of Danny Devito's character of a ringmaster to be a werewolf. You can erase that part and still have the respect between him and Bloom which eventually leads him to the young Sandra. Most of the time it works well, allowing Burton to deliver settings and characters that venture easily into fantasy and fairytale. The visuals shine most strongly in these segments. Take the wondrous and heavenly town of Spectre, perfectly symmetrical in its lines of buildings and picturesque with its highly saturated green lawns. It becomes even more beautiful at night, framed by a cluster of lights and that strange string of stolen shoes hanging overhead. Or maybe the endless sea of bright yellow daffodils that Bloom woos Sandra with. It never gets too serious like a good bedtime story. The scale and terror of the Korean War is minimised to a small set where Siamese twins perform for the wartime troops while Bloom parachutes in to steal plans. It's bizarrely charming even through the broken Cantonese; instead of a gritty action sequence, McGregor pauses the scene for a second to take out his night-vision goggles, pulls the light string and a series of looney-tunes like sound effects serves his escape instead. You can't help but laugh. When Bloom struggles through a murky forest covered in spiders, the score turns ominous until he suddenly realises this isn't how he dies and he escapes casually. That later becomes the push for the penultimate scene where the father-son relationship is finally reconciled and Will takes on the mantle of the storyteller, finishing his father's life story. Elfman and Lebenzon work closely together here; the tender voice-over narrates the escape from the hospital, the score spirited and encouraging and urging them onwards. The fantasy sequence is warmly coloured and brisk while reality is colder, bluer and more intimate, as the close-ups dictate. The most solemn and revealing scene however is the final one, the funeral of Bloom where the entire cast of characters from those tall tales end up being, well, not so tall after all (in Karl's case, quite literally). Burton lets us quietly contemplate in that instance, which perhaps makes that final voice-over grating when there's plenty of meaning and subtext in the children's gossip and that final shot of the enormous catfish. There's certainly little bits here and there in Big Fish that could be trimmed; Burton is at times guilty of using the storytelling device to showcase fantastic visuals but not actually show us anything new about our characters. Bonham Carter certainly doesn't need to play a double role, and Buscemi's character is peculiarly uneven (for once I would have preferred Depp, even with his marriage to Burton). But overall, Big Fish is a great and nostalgic viewing. The set design and cinematography perfectly capture the time period, the colours wistful and vivid and the architecture whimsy. Foregoing veracity is the right choice for this magical tale, because Big Fish becomes grandiose in its own little sphere, yet modest and intimate. Bloom is dying yet ironically more alive than any other character, living vicariously through the stories of the past. And we can easily join in.",8,1,1,29 August 2015
Annie Hall," I guess we keep going' through it because, uh, most of us...need the eggs
","Annie Hall is one of those rare romantic comedies that manages to hit the exact note with its tone throughout and it starts with Allen and Brickman's Oscar winning screenplay. It brims with topical 70s references and the biting wit of the former stand up comedian's material, which makes for many laughs, but even more importantly it's a stunningly authentic and wistful insight into the failed relationship of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall. The film makes no mistake telling you this from the start; Alvy begins with that opening monologue and you are left trying to figure out exactly the reason for this unhappy ending. It's non-linearity at its best and edited with brutal honesty; Alvy wants Annie to experience the wonders of adult education, which cuts to a while later, a jealous Alvy now bitterly against the idea when another man turns up. Perhaps Allen wanted the main focus of the film to be from Allen's perspective, lamenting the spotlight of the couple's relationship. There's signs of that too. Alvy at heart is just a boy who discovered nihilism a little early, and somehow he never grows out of that mindset , giving into his sexual curiosity and kissing his classmate. Allen portrays the extents of this short neurotic comedian with such honesty - sometimes petty, from his youth pessimistic, always cynical. He's cultured to a degree - there's that famous scene where he drags a theatre-goer criticising Fellini and McLuhan and produces the latter from behind a sign, with an exasperated air of authority. Yet he also zones out at the complex musings on Bob Dylan from a Rolling Stone reporter (Shelley Duvall), and feels dismissive of the high aiming Allison. There's disdain for California show biz that he often voices ('That's because they don't throw their garbage away, they turn it into television shows'). That's displayed by Willis in the contrast between the golden dazzle of the party and the muted greys of New York, ever gloomy like Alvy. It begs the question exactly what Alvy sees in the free spirited and scatterbrained Annie Hall, played to perfection by Diane Keaton (and impeccably dressed too). There's wonderful little mannerisms that add to the persona, no better than the initial meeting where she stumbles over her words, shakes her head playfully when prompted of her weekend availability, and later struggles to hold in her laughter retelling a family story, which is ordinary made wonderful by Keaton. Their chemistry is apparent from the start and is most evident in the first post-breakup scene where Alvy is called over in the midst of another one night stand to kill a spider. That shockingly real moment where Annie breaks down and confesses that she misses him is perfect. And Alvy reacts how at first? By cracking a joke of course, after his furiously awkawrd slaying of the spider.The non-linearity and the constant shifting of the tone and the dynamics of the relationship are aided by the impressive number of Allen's visual techniques. There's the yellow subtitles exposing both of the pair's nervous inhibitions that encapsulates their opposing perspectives and manages to be both sincere and humorous. Later the voice-over on the plane does the same, in a more wistful way near breakup. There's the attempts from Alvy to confront and complain about his relationship to random passer-bys, at times more honest than he is with his doctor. It's genuine; the audience can empathise with his plight. And there's the long roving takes that are pervasive throughout the relationship; sustaining real time emotions and tensions and allowing the pair to shine. By the end of the film, we know exactly why the pair broke up in the first place.What else are we supposed to wish for than that Hollywood ending that Alvy acknowledges as his first play, and thus, his first real desire for an unattainable woman? He painstakingly tries to recreate the lobster fiasco, and in doing so cracks a joke and creates even more awkwardness. But that's Alvy. His own brand of humour is his self defence, and in this miserable world, even finding a brief window of perfection with Annie, cannot change. Even more, he's self-loathing, jealous, and insecure, like a lot of us. Annie Hall might have become a complicated murder mystery, or in the hands of another director or writer, end on that glistening kiss under the bridge. Thank god it didn't.",10,0,0,10 August 2015
Toy Story," To Infinity and Beyond!
","It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995.",9,0,1,22 July 2015
The Graduate," Plastics.
","Benjamin Braddock is at the tender age in his life where the whole world awaits him and the possibilities are endless. Well, less endless then he might hope; his parents expect him to go on straight into graduate school with a long list of accolades and a much shorter list of career pathways. The frame shakes as he is rocked by each invasive query, each violation of his tender emotional state, each beady eye and ruffle of the hair. This delicate stage of every promising young man's life is full of tricky contradictions and impossible expectations; they baby and smother him, they tweak his nose, they carefully plan out every stone in the path. At the same time they are urging him to overreach, to surpass his potential, in other words...to act and behave like an adult almost immediately. Hoffman was twenty-nine, but doesn't he emblematise exactly where Ben is at; the constant agony carved deep into his face, the almost teary eyes, the stiffness in his body as he is maneuvered around the party's guests like an automaton. And so this goes on and on, for far too long, but I suppose the few weeks or months the film depicts must be an eternity of anguish for someone in their youthful twenties. Again and again we are thrust into the closeup of his despondent face, and then the zoom out reveals just how lonely he is, even in the midst of crowds of civilians (on a plane, or at a college campus). The film is deliberately drenched in the melancholic tunes of Simon & Garfunkel, as if it was Ben himself stuck by the radio in self-mourning (it's missing those delightful acoustic licks that would be in the studio version later). There may be a seldom instance of brief respite - see Ben surrounded by pure darkness, and then the witty zoom out that reveals it is just the hotel bed-board, the equivalent of a sly wink from Nichols - but it becomes so difficult to unearth anything else from Ben, so submerged in his grief. There are other neat camera and editing tricks, which seem frivolous at best. Naturally, all this moping around makes him an easy target for Mrs Robinson. She stalks around his innocent inhibitions, frames him like prey through the outline of her legs. Initially it seems harmless, a bit of naughty fun. He makes the accusation with a wide grin on his face, and the soundtrack sneaks in cheekily, like a twisted porno. Eventually it becomes obvious just how inexperienced he is, and how she is merely taking advantage of his situation to tame her primal needs. She's clever enough to prod him lightly into what she wants, prevent him from realising what she is doing. In the middle of the affair Ben refuses to go on, but she ever so slyly gives him a dose of his own medicine, turning self-conscious, and immediately he relents, because an intrinsic morality and nobility has been instilled into him. But Nichols is so determined to stack the odds against the older generation, so she is never developed further along the lines of her tragic past, and becomes a mean-spirited, stuffy stereotype. A better film might have folded Ben's own sensibilities and insecurities back into Mrs Robinson, making the whole tryst a doubly desperate attempt to recapture that youth, the fleeting moments of freedom, irresponsibility and spirit. But she is simply a predator. Her conversations with Ben are as empty as those of him and her daughter.The first impression of Nichols' goal by many (and still quite a few) is a celebration of the youthful vivacity of Ben, of his daring and radical relinquishment of all that is expected of him. The adults are all screaming themselves hoarse at his intrusion, and even Mrs Robinson has grown old and blind enough that her entrapment has been forgotten and she too is yelling. Ben is adamant to break the cycle; look at his disgust when Elaine mentions the putrid and unromantic method that she has been proposed to. It's no jumping on a bus and running away, which is in itself vague and directionless after the excitement has worn off. Nichols avoids any overt contextualisation, but the subtext is there, the counter-culture of the 60s, fighting hard for peace, for sex, for drugs, for equality, for the shedding of society's artificial excess. So these hippies and bohemians wanted widespread societal change, the overthrowing of the authoritative structures that bound them, but what then? Noble ventures aside, many of these endeavours seem more and more as fruitless and frozen-in- time as the lull in the back of that bus, as the young pair exchange nervous glances and the fervour slowly wears off. Perhaps a corporate desk job at Plastics Inc. might not have been so bad after all. Where oh where is Joe DiMaggio in a time like this?",6,0,0,30 July 2016
This Is Spinal Tap," These go to eleven.
","Film-maker Marty DeBergi has assigned himself a mission to investigate the inner lives of the rock band Spinal Tap, who he is drawn to not because of their lyrical poetry or their composition but because they can lay claim to being one of the loudest bands in Britain. Marty is played by Rob Reiner himself and is the crucial building block of his debut mockumentary. He wields his camera with sincerity, honesty and authenticity, and seems to hold the same qualities in his face, letting the inevitable mayhem of the band happen before his eyes. Reiner is a great comedic actor; he knows when to nod politely, and when to feign modest interest (almost always), and throughout the entire journey does not ever relinquish his poker face even slightly. His seriousness lends legitimacy to his capturing of the rogue band, and makes it all the more funny when they break from convention.The genius of the film is in how little effort Marty has put to in to get any decent material for his documentary. He points the camera, offers a few probing questions, and Spinal Tap do the rest. Through the simple verite style presentation there is the suggestion of a wilder, greater life that these musicians occupy off the screen, and how lucky for Marty to be able to capture even a little insight. They are larger than life itself, and even in the mundane they pop. Some of the humour comes from Reiner simply extending the documentary's boundaries, and pretending as if this was a completely normal venture. Marty asks, very solemnly, if the current Spinal Tap drummer Mick Shrimpton is afraid of the unfortunate fate of all the previous drummers, and Mick replies in turn, with all seriousness, that it was a legitimate issue that was discussed between them, as if he was talking about a missing tom- tom. Oh, and he's in the bathtub. Reiner also draws from another rather famous British band, in both style and content, and in a way that immediately produces contrast. A Hard Day's Night was one of the early mockumentaries that birthed an entire genre, and crafted a whole set of rules and guidelines from which concert films were to be made. They are all noticeably here, and Reiner freely exaggerates: the push-ins to the band's orgasmic expressions, the reaction shots of the (less than) ecstatic audience, the way the camera hurtles through backstage trying desperately to keep up with the mania of the crew. When Tufnel storms off in disgust after a particularly terrible show, see how we are immediately chasing after him, the frame bouncing with each step, and pausing for the full gravitas of the ugly stare-down. Who is causing the rift in Spinal Tap? None other than the Yoko Ono of their time, an earth- loving hippie who increasingly pushes her unwanted presence into the band's affairs. But Spinal Tap have been there and done that - their early, drug-fuelled hit (Listen To The) Flower People must be as flabbergasting as Lennon's I Am The Walrus. McKean, Guest and the rest of Spinal Tap are wild in the best way, given free reign to go haywire. They tap into a very specific and familiar persona of the rock star and all the glamorous, egocentric pretensions that come along with their music, and all the drama, backlash and toxic infighting that brings about their inevitable downfall (and comeback tour). All this, as the laws dictate, must be well publicised, and Reiner observes ever so diligently. The band is pompous, fired up from their brief success and thinking that no artistic boundary is beyond them. They hastily deflect any accusations or criticisms because such things are below their level. The critics may have been right - the White Album did have nothing on its cover, but even that is not so absurd as the excessively graphic content of Smell the Glove. Their other albums have similarly humorous titles. Some are simply two phrases stuck together - Shark Sandwich, Robotic Armchair, Cerebral Badger. You get the idea.They think themselves poets, and resort to more and more desperation in order to win back their audience. Reiner produces his funniest scenes when he points towards just how insecure and vulnerable Spinal Tap really are. When challenged on the fact that most of their fans are clueless teenage boys, they retort that it is their primal masculinity that draws the envy (and fear) of both sexes. Later, a timid Derek Smalls is caught with a tinfoil- wrapped cucumber in his pants, left standing there humiliated. The climax is the reveal of the tiny Stonehenge statue, derailed by a hastily drawn napkin diagram. Reiner doesn't stray an inch; he shows the conventional shots, the passion, the feverish crowd, the dazzling lights, and then just lowers the model and lets Spinal Tap react and fall apart. And yet they are not arrogant to the point of dislike. We chuckle as they get second billing to a puppet show, and feel a little sorry when things out of their control cripple their last ditch efforts. So when Tufnel bursts back onto the stage for the teary reunion, we laugh at the sheer absurdity of the timing of it all, but at the same time we are also cheering them on and lining up for the comeback tour.",9,1,2,15 August 2016
Toy Story 2," Then again, the timespan of a childhood is not infinity
","Toy Story 2 opens with such a vivid and riveting intro sequence that its success was later replicated in a similar manner in Toy Story 3. It's at once more exciting than its predecessor and shows improvement in all areas, from the rousing opening track Zurg's planet which sets the adventurous tone (easily reminiscent of Williams' Star Wars), to the sound design of Buzz's rocket propelled flight through the impressive 3 dimensional rock field and fluid animation which showcases a whole new level of dynamism and camera movement in the characters. You can visualise the weight and care as Buzz balances himself on the floating platforms (playing a note each of Thus Spoke Zarathustra) or witness the motion blur of a back-flip. There's even a humorous note to it as Buzz pulls off that cool acrobatic and is immediately blown to smithereens - only then do we find out it was all the incompetence of Rex the Dinosaur playing a video game. Genius. It's such an achievement of Pixar, just 4 years after the first fully computer animated feature film, to showcase so must in so little runtime. Toy Story was about cooler new toys taking the place of older treasured ones. Its sequel poses an even heavier question: what happens when kids eventually outgrow their toys? To be fair, it's not directly addressed until more than a decade later in Toy Story 3, but here Woody briefly considers the more eternal choice of being admired long after Andy has grown up, in a prestigious toy museum in Tokyo. It's such a humanising screenplay which gives some powerful motivation behind this decision; when Woody first finds out his historical and vintage value as a collector's item; his eyes light up and stare in amazement. Lasseter counters with another notion - priceless as he may be, locked up in a glass case he will never again wear the marks of playtime, only be admired at a distance. In the end Woody realises that his friends and Andy's happiness provide a more valuable sense of identity than just being a toy celebrity, but Lasseter doesn't make this a frivolous choice without any weight. Beyond the greedy and selfish Al there lies a very overlooked and artistic scene where Geri the Cleaner, of Geri's Game fame, lovingly repairs the years of damage Andy has inflicted. Geri, much like Andy or any other child, clearly cares about toys, although in a different way. Again it's a Pixar master-class; the sound design and animation work closely to show every intimate detail from the intricate reflection in the polished eyeballs, squirts of dye to colour his rosy cheeks, the slight shake of Geri's fingers and a tongue poked out in concentration, and of course the symbolic act of painting over the ANDY tag on the soles of his boots. It's all accompanied by one of Newman's more distinctive and playful themes. Woody's predicament is contrasted by both Buzz and newcomer Jessie, tenderly voiced by Joan Cusack who provides two different sides of the abandoned cowgirl; one mournful, the other spunky. It's a heartbreaking montage in the middle of the film which spells this out, to the tune of When She Loved Me by Sarah McLachlan. She too, decides that time spent with each child is precious no matter who, and in some way mirrors the eventual transition in TS3. It mirrors the attitude of Prospector Pete, never having experienced a child's love, still in his original box, and harbouring resentment at space toys taking over the popularity of Western toys. He seeks adoration and will stop at nothing to get it. Buzz faces the opposite scenario of Woody; instead of being a collector's item, he is greeted with the display of hundreds upon thousands of identical toys just like himself, forcing him to reconsider his worth. There's wry humour to be gleaned here, when a rogue Buzz fresh out of the box takes his place in the gang ('Tell me I wasn't this deluded'). It's a credit to Tim Allen's voice acting to pull both personae off with such conviction. In the end, it's the ANDY on the soles of their feet that give them their worth, even for a fleeting moment in a child's life. Beside Jessie there's a whole new range of characters that contribute to the humour and world of TS2. Who can forget Bullseye, the eager dog-like companion that despite never speaking a world, displays oodles of affection and playfulness? The catchphrase 'Run like the wind, Bullseye' becomes an instant classic. What about the ever smiling and fast talking Barbie tour guide, verging on the edge of creepiness? Or Mrs Potatoe Head, the dutiful wife of Mr PH (who excels in the very entertaining credits, first introduced as a concept earlier in A Bug's Life)? Returning characters also get more screen-time and lines to work with. Who can forget the sly and charming Hamm (although I prefer 'Slotted Pig'), the loyal Slinky Dog, sassy Mr Potatoe Head (remarking 'That went well' after the gang causes a major traffic accident crossing the street) or overly enthusiastic Rex, who's sole attention during the whole film is actually finding out how to defeat Zurg, the video game boss?Toy Story 2 is one of those rare sequels that outshines its original in almost every way. It's technically impressive, it's voice cast is excellent and it's screenplay builds upon the predicament of the first and adds deeper, universal (well for toys at least) themes with emotional resonance. Perhaps it's the telling words of Wheezy the broken penguin that have the most significance; he points out that all toys are just one tear away from being sold off in a garage sale or donated. But that just makes each moment of play all the more precious.",10,0,1,24 July 2015
A Clockwork Orange," What's it going to be, eh?
","Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange applies a coat of comic absurdity to the ultra-violence of Alex and his droogs. It is more boisterous than Burgess' novel which masks the explicitness with Nadsat slang, which is much less prevalent in the film. The opening slow dolly away has his gang sprawled out in the Moldova milk bar, a innocent little front for a haven where drugged milk is dispensed out of a bound and chained female sculpture. The ornate mise en scène and the grandiose and imposing electronic Purcell piece create such a chaotic and chilling atmosphere in spite of the setting. Later, the gang ride in the Durango 95, the front two hunched over while the back two sit upright and serenade the wind of the night. Several vehicles swerve almost comically away to avoid a crash and I am reminded of a cartoonish style to the whole approach, green-screen and all. All it needs is some exaggerated sound effects when a car smashes into a wall, as if someone pushed over a whole shelf of percussion instruments in the same way Alex pushes over Mr Alexander's books in his hooliganism. And in that tunnel, the night is young and the lighting is low key and nightmarish, illuminating each savage blow but also distancing us from this dreadful act. Later it's revisited in broad daylight by the subdued Alex, and it's a telling contrast of his persona. Malcolm McDowell's Alex is integral part of the film - he is a young man without a conventional moral framework and without direction, and he plays the hoodlum with a charm and dignified personality at times. His speech is theatrical and his charismatic persona that of a performance artist, accompanied by classical music. Kubrick's changes from the novel serve to accentuate this. The cat lady is morphed into a narcissistic, pretentious and needlessly aggressive character who parades erotic pieces of 'art' throughout her home and practises fetishised yoga. Alex mocks her in a dizzying hand-held and frenetic manner, giggling endlessly as he ridicules the phallic sculpture in an energetically charged crime. The rape of two young girls is changed to an act of sexual athletics, sped up rhythmically to an electric Rossini's William Tell Overture. The world of Alex DeLarge is a decadent one - gangs brawl on decaying stages, police insert their own brand of brutality, social leaders and the opposition in turn fight over the people's vote and Alex as a social icon for change. The home of the DeLarge's is covered in semi-erotic art, the lurid coloured hair, makeup and dress of the mother reminiscent of a 'filthy old soomka'. Deltoid's visit to the residence has him show more affection to Alex than either of his parent's and hints at some childhood abuse. Alex's groans of pain in his hospital bed alternate with groans of pleasure of a nurse and doctor behind the curtain. The prison hymn admonishes individual aimless wandering and urges obedience to the shepherd's voice, another instance of symbolism. His faithful droogs receive a slow-motion assault for bringing up their own motivations and ideas against Alex's authority, and later repay the act with their own smashing of a milk bottle. Years later the pair assault Alex as policemen and the classical score is distorted by Walter Carlos with each hit of the baton, where the treatment and the absence of the Alex POV (the distorted worldview brought about by the use of wide angle lenses) suddenly strips the act of violence of its theatrical elements. What we witness is a world full of people obsessed with self-gratification and a desire to control others. The hypocrisy of the state singles out Alex for the Ludovico technique, and his treatment is edited to doubly affect us as the audience as well. As the glorious Beethoven stirs from the speakers, we too witness the atrocities of the Naxi regime, the rapes, the beatings...never once shot to contextualise it as a medical experiment on a fictitious theatre screen but as a genuine part of the film reel. We cannot escape like Alex. The satirical element manifests in the character of the Minister of the Interior, a cultured man who enjoys Beethoven like Alex, and is so politically consumed that at the drop of a hat he will reverse his stance and openly encourage Alex's despicable lifestyle. If you may, Alex is the youth under control; a baby even (those delightful mannerisms where he opens his mouth agape to be fed by the Minister). He is a monstrous and morally reprehensible figure, yet easily enabled by the politician in a bid for publicity. On the other side you have Mr Alexander, tremendously well acted by Patrick Magee with his clipped speech patterns and trembling presence. He is long suffering and initially kind to an equally down trodden Alex, yet reveals himself to be a radically left wing activist who opposes the government's corruption and abusive methods. And again, he is shown to hypocritically take advantage of Alex himself in drugging and torturing him with Beethoven. That final fantasy of Alex's is as surreal as his earlier ones; a determination in that whipping motion on Jesus of Nazareth, a blood-lusted Dracula, or surrounded by Egyptian slave girls. This time it's slowed down and appropriate too; he relishes in the sexual performance while a well-dressed classy crowd looks on and applauds with approval. Burgess' novel and Catholic Roots have Alex coming to a realisation of the pointless nature of his violent lifestyle and pondering a future and a family. That is problematic in proposing that Alex's delinquency will simply phase out. Kubrick's ending is a much more vivid and horrifying one; the world has given him free rein and will. What use is an orange if you peel back the organic layer and find a mechanic disposition?",10,5,7,4 September 2015
Sicario," (in Spanish) Time to meet God.
","By now, Denis Villeneuve can no longer be considered the promising young director even as he continually makes waves in Hollywood. Portions of Sicario resemble a sleek, well-designed action thriller, and that begins with his technical direction. The sound mixing is exquisite, combining the thudding, ominous score of Jóhann Jóhannsson with every booming gunshot that means another life taken. The cinematography by Roger Deakins captures a Mexico in decay, with a beige-seeped and yellowed palette contrasting the cooler blues of the American nightlife. See the difference between the climatic dinner execution, bathed in a warm domestic glow about to be sullied with blood, and the final confrontation in the cold sterility of Kate's apartment - this is no breeding ground for empathy or justice. From this point Sicario makes a big show of emphasising how its characters are bound or unbound by their domestic situation. Kate is divorced with no kids, as her interrogation tells us, and that frees her up to make the harder decisions and be the whistle-blower to a corrupt system. Likewise Alejandro has lost his family, and that simultaneously drives him to be the lone renegade and allows him to cross legal and moral boundaries that a shackled family man might not be so inclined to. And I'm willing to bet a king's ransom that Matt also has no such immediate family to hold him back from casually rolling with all these murky dealings - he's even perfected the art of forgoing corporate pretense by the look of his flip flops. On the other side of the fence there are clumsy attempts to appeal to our sentimentality through brief and infrequent peeks into one specific Mexican father and his soccer-loving son. But the film is so preoccupied with how the American invaders feel it scarcely pauses to consider their perspective: 'This is how the world works,' say the men with guns, and don't you dare try to challenge it with your own experiences. It's a rather shallow attempt at humanising them, and because we don't discover its relevance to the story until late on in the film, it seems to exist in an entirely separate reality from the drug-riddled Mexico that the soldiers tackle. Emily Blunt, to her credit, never ever makes the suggestion that it is her femininity that allows her to make these observations, and the film doesn't suggest feminine weakness as a contributing factor to her powerlessness. She's not a token female, and she's tough enough to ask the hard questions where it matters. Yet the character irregardless of gender is a little hollow, poised to be willfully naive and painfully out of her depth - an early experience establishes her credentials and experience before waving them away to enable her to be our moral proxy. I lost count of how many times she stages confrontations that are thinly doubled to act as the audience's perceived moral outrage. Kate wants to arrest Díaz for money laundering, and Villeneuve just giggles and pats her on the head condescendingly. In reality this is not such a bad idea, since many high profile criminals have been nailed for much smaller crimes than their larger implied offences, but in the movie world it's an insult to the well-oiled machine of corruption that swallows pure-hearted idealists like her and spits out moral ambiguity. It's problematic to begin dismantling her when there's little to dismantle. Kate's moral convictions are barely drawn and sparsely constructed of simple catchphrases like 'I have to know.' Though she may be interested in preserving legal justice and cleaning up the streets for the more fair, soccer-loving Mexican folk, the film doesn't attempt to link the two. That comes from Alejandro, Benicio del Toro as a video-game character come to life. He's not a person but a lean, mean assassination machine, lurking in the shadows and striking at opportunistic moments. With his guns and silencer he is an almost comical force of nature, and although the aim is not to glorify this type of vengeance (but regretfully admit its usefulness), he does so anyway. He's much too cool, much too efficient, and growls buzzwords that indicate the necessity of his job: 'This is a land of wolves now.' Additionally, for all the film's moralising on violence it sometimes utilises it as a punchline - see how the nightmarish POV in the tunnel slowly uncovers ghostly footsteps, and then bloody bodies slumped up against the walls. There is little logic in a seasoned FBI agent gawking at the ground in a hostile raid - the shot is exploitative of the same type of graphic and transgressive content that her character argues so vehemently against. Sicario is so hard pressed and insistent on moving away from Hollywood-wrapped comfort and into the harshness of 'reality' that it revels in its ugliness and cynicism. Matt and Alejandro are correct in many ways, and the public would be content in reaping the rewards of their work whilst not looking too closely at the finer print. But to deliver it via such obvious, obnoxious caricatures feels much too simplistic, ironic for a film that champions the thought process of 'the ends justify the means'. It's the complete opposite of ambiguity; it keeps stacking the chips of the opposing sides higher and higher, trying to outdo each other with senseless violence, bravado and brutality. And then it feebly tosses Kate in the middle of this mess, hurls her around for a bit, then shrugs and says 'Eh, we tried'. It's the cinematic equivalent of pointing a gun to the audience's head and asking: 'You're either with us or against us', and then condemning you for choosing the lesser of two evils anyway.",6,1,2,30 December 2016
Departures," They all burn the same.
","The opening vignette of Departures, much like how a dapper Jack Black gaily demonstrates the final cosmetic procedures before casketing in Richard Linklater's Bernie, reveals how the end of one's life can sometimes result in unexpectedly light moments. Faced with the uncertainty of what comes after death in an age of increasing agnosticism, families turn to humour as a way of shielding themselves from the heartbreak of a life now longer living with them. And what of those who service the departed, who are often caught in the midst of this torrent of emotional outpour? For Daigo Kobayashi, a recently dumped cellist, there is no easy answer. Faced with the uncomfortable discovery that the beautiful woman he is preparing was previously a man, he tries to be discreet, asking for the family's preference in a whisper. The ceremony itself is supposed to shroud the departed's bare skin from those in mourning. The camera even lowers itself to knee height, Ozu-style, as they enter the home and bow in solemn respect. But the parents return the whisper with a loud, tactless query, and the serenity is visibly shattered. Not that the victim cares. And it is only later that we learn that the moment serves as a realisation for the parent's love of their child, man or woman. In other encoffining jobs, Daigo is the odd man out as the ritual airs out old grievances and suppressed anger. Masahiro Motoki has the right face for the role; youthful, earnest, often bewildered, and when his dignified routine is interrupted by domestic quarrels, his eyes widen and his mouth is agape with quiet shock. What is the correct emotional response for a worker in these situations? He is paid to operate and witness the most vulnerable of moments, as generations break down and sob for their departed, and all he can do is provide a little solace through wood, cloth and petal. A bowing of the head seems sufficient, he initially believes.He works for Sasaki, played by Tsutomu Yamazaki. Some may recognise him as the cowboy hat wearing, John Wayne-esque nomad from the ramen western Tampopo, a gruff realist who sizes Daigo up with one look and offers him the job immediately (perhaps out of necessity rather than potential), but later scolds him like a child when he cannot bear the odour of a two week-old corpse. While Sasaki's demeanour is almost entirely austere, having taken on the lonely burden of this role, Daigo is practically hysterical, scurrying from public bus to private bathhouse to scrub physical filth and social taboo from the pores of his skin. There is a comedic 'skit' of sorts where he acts as a model corpse for Sasaki to demonstrate his craft upon, and shrieks when a razor pricks his cheek. The scene makes little logical sense; why would such a sparsely populated profession need a training DVD? But it does reveal Daigo to be the child he is, at least initially, not yet properly equipped with the maturity and life experience to handle the affairs of farewelling the dead. Music is presented as a significant motif; Daigo's expensive cello is sold in the beginning to escape debt and return to simple, rural living, but as he finds meaning in his new work (and cash), he is reunited with his childhood instrument. Gradually we discover it to be the heart of Daigo's conflicted nostalgia for the shack that once fronted as his mother's coffee shop. A sly shot from Takita circles the older Daigo engrossed in his art, before moving behind a pillar and smoothly transitioning to a younger boy rehearsing laboriously before his parents. Joe Hisaishi centres his score around the instrument, and in a pivotal musical montage, Daigo cradles the cello with the same finesse and grace that he now applies to the departed. His final catharsis lies in the act of encoffining his own estranged father, his work becoming deeply personal. The film's story is peppered with references to this childhood trauma, obscuring the father's face with the blurry haze of selective memory and choice shot compositions. To show the body and visage in clear focus is already monumental, and to witness Daigo caressing and preparing his father's body for a simple wooden coffin is more than enough. There is a lifetime of unspoken words in those gestures. Takita tacks on a cheesy, slow-motion revelation of a 'feeling stone' that he transfers onto the next generation, and explicit flashbacks, but it isn't necessary. The son is shaving the father. The cycle is complete.",8,0,0,9 June 2018
The Da Vinci Code," But first, a test of honor.
","I'm actually impressed by how effective this schmaltzy blockbuster is. The original novel by Dan Brown had an immediate impact and popularity, partly because of its controversial premise that made people flock to find out the truth for themselves. Brown semi-convincingly weaves enough historical truth and reference into it that the more gullible reader takes at face value. I remember myself being momentarily amazed after looking closely at The Last Supper for the first time and seeing the feminine figure hand in hand with Jesus Christ himself. That was a page turner - doctor waiting room material, for light reading on public transport, and so on. The film takes on the same qualities. It starts essentially as a detective mystery, which is a genre which has worked for centuries because we as an audience like being told that final, baffling yet brilliant solution and then rifling back through the pages and picking up on the clues that have been subtly inserted. The film, like the novel, is effective because it builds on our assumed knowledge and weedles its way past our doubts. We know the Mona Lisa, we know the Last Supper, we know the legend of the Holy Grail, but did we know these little secrets beyond them? How many knew of the Opus Dei before The Da-Vinci Code?What the detective mystery also relies on is dumping loads of information and then re-assembling the bits into a solution that the audience would recognise but not have the expertise to solve themselves. The film takes the laziest route here, relying on the authoritative prowess and aura of veterans like Hanks and McKellen to continually be fountains of knowledge, to know the answer to every question from the clueless vessel of Tautou, who doubles as the viewer. Everyone knows Hanks and McKellen, so we don't doubt what they say, and when they are confronted with a seemingly baffling puzzle to solve, their historical and intellectual know-how isn't questioned. This is of course film-making at the lowest level; there are scenes where the two are basically narrating straight from the novel, talking directly at Tautou and therefore the viewer, making sure they are up to speed. Everything serves to move the film along. There is remarkably zero fat for something almost three hours long. Part of this is nonsensical padding; Sauniere's final cryptic message scrawled in blood is an anagram which leads to the Mona Lisa, which contains another anagram to another artwork, which leads to a key with another puzzle...and so on. If you take a step back all this mystery seems tedious and convoluted, and a few of the steps are unnecessary. But because the film is so brisk, never giving any breathing room but rushing from puzzle to puzzle, it doesn't ever feel like dragging. Our curiosity is swiftly and efficiently replaced by another, and there is never any time to really think or reflect. The film format is visual, so Howard has gone above and beyond the book, gifted with a generous budget, to further add to the faux historical authenticity of the premise. The lavish flashbacks are clearly colour coded, with a slight wash to contrast so we know exactly what timeline we are experiencing. The characters narrate over them with the air of authority as if they were providing the voice-over for a historical documentary. Langdon's opening presentation is directed not only at his chirpy lecture audience, but also at the viewer, overturning all their preconceptions with a flashy barrage of symbols and their secondary meanings. Every mystery is given immediate priority; the novel presented a puzzle and solved it almost immediately, to the reader's satisfaction. When they do the little bait and switch on the plane, seconds later we see the washed out flashback explaining exactly what happened. This is low culture entertainment, but it certainly is effective.",6,0,1,7 July 2016
Mystic River," We wash them clean.
","Mystic River investigates the effects of one fateful car trip many years ago and its effects in the adults that manifested from them. If Eastwood had wanted to complicate things he might have given further identities to the young Jimmy, Dave and Sean, and asked us to ponder the differences in the years. But they are only kids, and still have so much time to develop, so Eastwood doesn't make mountains of molehills (the defiant one of the three, for example, could have had implications in the future). The film falls short of being a masterpiece because it inevitably bogs itself down in the detective story of it all - the whodunit aspect and the police procedural investigation. Sean in these segments becomes less a character and more a uniform, with his straight-forward, no nonsense approach which curiously render him rather removed from the emotions of the whole affair, or at least compared to the turmoil that is thrust onto Jimmy and Dave. A better film might have shifted from that traditional Hollywood concern which is so determined to provide answers and instead explore the fractures the car trip has created in the extended lives of the three. Another fault is that Eastwood spends the majority of his time on the three, but seldom puts the extended cast into focus. For Sean, he is reeling from the aftermath of a divorce, but this is scarcely addressed after his introduction and then magically resolved in the end. How powerful might Laura Linney's magnetic, macabre approval have been if a precedent had been established? If we saw the deep-seated emotions she praises in her husband, if her character had been afforded any relevance in the story previously? These closing moments feel tacked on, as if Eastwood felt the need to broaden his narrative but only realised too late.So he builds the film from the bedrock of two powerhouse and academy award winning performances. First is Tim Robbins. He is, in a sense, playing two characters. The frightful and abusive past revealed through brief flashbacks allows us to be alert of its presence in his adult persona. The further we get in the film the more often it emerges. Robbins slips in and out of that child, trapped in the basement and in his own mind, blithering and babbling and reverting back into that shell. So in a way, when Jimmy answers that he last saw Dave years ago in that car, he is telling a truth. Penn's performance is not only driven but controlled by emotion. When he sobs for his daughter, he is at his most genuine, but for the rest of the film his mind is riddled with mistrust and paranoia and wrath. He becomes the best example for how the kids and community witness a trauma, and not fully understanding it, mark Dave from that day forth as damaged. Tragically, the truest image of them all is in the end, simple scrawlings in wet cement, weathered by time and lies.",8,0,0,3 July 2016
The Departed," Years ago we had the church.
","'I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.' So growls Frank Costello, king mobster of Boston. He has more words of wisdom for those looking to make it in the big city, 'If you want something, you have to take it.' The veins of masculinity, morality and identity run strongly through The Departed, as in many a Scorsese movie. But the latter line is actually pilfered from the Buddhist-steeped crime flick from Hong Kong, Infernal Affairs, uttered by Andrew Lau as he shoots the original Costello and ties up all loose ends. He has emerged with his ideal life, taken it with his bare hands, years and years of luxury and rising through the police ranks making this decision for him. When Damon offs his own Costello, it's channeled through impotent rage and betrayal. The gilded State House dome that his apartment overlooks (a rather obvious motif) suddenly isn't so glittery after all. It speaks to the inconsistency of his motivations; how honourable can he be to the state when he was the rat all along? Or has he been lying to himself this whole time? He wants to have his cake and eat it too. You understand the appeal of a father figure like Costello to a 12 year old boy (wow, magazines!), who can have anything in the palm of his hand in an instant, although the character quickly sheds this mysticism in place for for an almost parody of the unpredictable, unstable gangster. The approach made sense in Burton's gothic web of shadows in Batman, where he rose to the challenge of the iconic comic book villain with a deranged mania, never quite telegraphing his actions to the audience. You couldn't guess whether his gun would sprout flowers or fire bullets. But it sticks out like a sore thumb in the gritty Irish Catholic world of Scorsese's Boston, every gesture a flourish, every threat underlined with a creepy grin. Hokey props reinforce it; a severed hand in a ziplock bag, and one of Nicholson's ideas (you wouldn't say no to a screen legend, would you?), a plastic dildo in a grimy porno theatre. Yes, these men sublimate violence for sex and vice versa, use one or the other as an outlet for their desires in the incestuous criminal underworld, but then along comes Nicholson to deflate the whole thing. The same can be said for Wahlberg's Dignam, himself accounting for half of the film's allotted profanity count, and in the end existing for little more than the plot's fail-safe (the deleted of Billy's file and identity lacks the original's gut punch for this very reason). Madolyn gets a better rap. Combining two paper-thin love interests into one, she further presses the issue of masculinity and impotence, serving as a foil to the mirrored leads in a tangled triangle. Notice that every facet of her and Sullivan's relationship revolves around humour and surface intimacy, how they'll be one step away from a serious conversation but hastily backtrack (usually into bed). Schoonmaker edits with a knotty, choppy precision, throwing in flashes of canted action and inverted angles, pilling on smash cut upon smash cut to stimulate urgency, bringing the camera rushing towards its subject before abruptly veering away. Its rhythm and intensity are palpable, drawing attention to the menace that underlines each encounter in the mobster world. See how she cuts the first phone call between the two leads. Not a single word is uttered - the tension is crafted from how she stages the pauses, the silence, the agony of hesitation. Will he answer, and will it mean his downfall?
 Scorsese's style makes the original Infernal Affairs look like a soap opera in comparison, and sometimes it's precisely that; slow motion, black and white flashbacks, mournful music. The claustrophobia of the Hong Kong setting could have used some of the remake's grit and paranoia. Costigan and Sullivan mirror each other, are two sides of the same coin. That much is obvious. The original script explored this further, and had none of the satisfaction or lasting finality of Scorsese's ending. Lau is doomed to perpetual hell, forever tortured by the path he took and the sins committed that led him to this point. Suppose you live and breath as a cop for 10 years, speaking and acting as if you were the good guy (and telling yourself that everyday). Would you eventually believe the same? Scorsese eliminates this option, makes Sullivan a product of his own unique environment, and then rips it all away from him in one go. He doesn't need to be shot. In the end, his entire world has been built by lies. You'd almost prefer to go the way of Costigan.",8,0,1,11 January 2018
Psycho," We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
","It's funny to see so many reviews of this classic marked for spoilers because the shower murder scene of Marion Crane is perhaps the most prominent example of film being embedded into the cultural psyche - and then parodied and mimicked so much that it birthed an entire new genre. It is Hitchcock's greatest use of montage - each cut as an assault on the audience's senses, each as another slash of the knife to Crane's dripping, screaming face. Eisenstein's theory means we do not actually see knife ever puncture flesh, but the separate images creates a merged meaning. And would it be half as iconic without Bernard Herrmann's contribution? The screeching strings are built up apprehensively before the pivotal scene, and when they finally match up with the knife, it slips in seamlessly with each slash, each cut, and it is frantic, horrifying. Hitchcock made history by killing her sensuous lead star less than halfway into his movie, but his mastery is shown in how effortlessly he moves our sympathies from the blonde to Norman Bates (actually they are not so different; compare the last, wicked smile with the furrow of the brow and the sneaking grin of Leigh in the exchanged car, as night's darkness descends on her but the light illuminates her face all the same - and those mischievous eyebrows!). We are continually shown the cop in the distance, a latent anxiety that makes the car swap all for naught. And we expect this to pan out somehow. This anxiety becomes Norman's as he discovers the murder - quickly, briefly, absentmindedly, as if he was just changing the sheets, he cleans up the mess. He puts on his boyish, gangly persona back on, and we pause as he does, hoping too the car will resume bubbling and sinking. And as his social facade is shaken by probing questions, we rally for him to regain his confidence and wish the detective away. Perkins is at the film's centre, with a brilliant, brilliant performance. With each rewatch it becomes a game to note his marked switches of his persona, his adoption of the psychopath's empty chuckle and stare. The social skills breakdowns are subtle; just a tiny pause, an awkward question, but not enough to make Crane too apprehensive. His wary eyes darting around just ever so slightly. His 'hobby' of taxidermy treads on the line between normal and deranged, but it is not until later do we recognise the sexual motif of the birds (his mother being his first stuffed corpse) and the way Perkin's body language uncannily points towards his internal psychological delusion. As if we did not receive the message clearly, Hitchcock superimposes a skull onto that final, chilling stare. Hitchcock also went to great lengths to hide his mystery whilst not compromising his visuals. The shadow behind the shower curtain and illuminating only the feminine wig. The bird's eye view of Arbogast's demise, complete with rear projection effect so it feels like he is falling into the stairs (not dissimilar to Hitchcock's own dolly zoom). The female silhouette high up in the Bates second-story window (it is not so far-fetched to imagine Norman propping up his late mother and having conversations with her). In one instance, the lazy-eye of the sheriff seems to address the audience itself and ask: 'Who then is that woman buried in the Bates grave?' I have come to accept the final psychiatrist's explanation as a necessary evil; it was a different time, as evident by Hitchcock's promos which forbid late entrants to theatre showings. Would a modern viewer ever entertain the idea of walking in halfway through a film only to realise the star had already been killed off? But Hitchcock set a precedent; no doubt viewers were all thoroughly confused to find Leigh bubbling under the swamp, but it only piqued their curiosity, their determination to unravel the mystery of Psycho.",10,0,1,20 April 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Pain, begone, I will have no more of thee!
","Rosemary's Baby is effective horror because it shows so little and suggests so much. Many have mistaken the brief, subliminal flash of the demon eyes near the end as the actual baby's eyes starting back at Rosemary. In reality it is the flashback of Satan himself from her nightmarish memories of the rape. We do not ever actually see the hell-spawn, but are left to imagine its horrific appearance from that classic, spine-chilling line from Farrow: 'What have you done to his eyes, you maniacs?!' In the vivid, dreamlike sequence where we first are thrust into the demonic world, the nervous, titillating camera perspective, the sound design and the way the edits jump back and forth do a fantastically eerie job of blurring the boundaries between the vision and reality. In fact the whole experience is handled so deftly by Polanski that we have a half-mind to agree with the worries of Dr Hill and call in support for this poor, deluded woman babbling about witchcraft and cultish conspiracies out to get her. Beneath the horror we also have the subtext of feminist issues which would seem a lot more apparent in the 60s. Horror has taken many elements of Gothicism but here we have Polanski (diligently sticking to Levin) channelling what Ellen Moers referred to as female Gothic, a little known literary movement depicting female heroines trapped and confined within suffocating spaces. Of course in the nineteenth century this was a reaction to an increasingly challenging and diverse literary sphere - whereas within the context of this film we have the female liberation's movement, and an issue very close to the heart of Rosemary, reproduction. So we have an overly dominant patriarchal force babying and forcing Rosemary into domesticity. She's given strange ailments that render her unable to leave the house, and it is only the strong feminine encouragement of her friends that enables her to stop the treatment. Guy's reaction is of course immediately volatile - Cassavetes' character is above all characterised by a tinge of misogyny. Who else would hand over their wife like property in exchange for fame, fortune and prestige?Another element that makes Rosemary's Baby so effective is Ruth Gordon's Minnie Castevet. She and her husband's constant flirting in and out of the frame tread a fine line between caring and bothersome until it becomes almost to much to bear for Rosemary. In fact they are almost too nice - we see how Polanski has engineered each social situation to wring every last drop of second hand embarrassment that we too want Minnie to stop bothering them because no one could be so selfless and serving. But wisely it is not taken to absurd extremes - partly because it would be overkill and partly because they want their cult to remain hidden. So she lets herself be waved off after pushing Rosemary to consume the drink soon, and doesn't barge into the party because it would be rude (and suspicious). Gordon never once breaks her doting grandmother routine, and this is key - even in the final, haunting reveal, they are all having a jovial little tea party complete with one jolly member taking pictures, and the normalcy with which they proceed draws Rosemary in. Well, it does have its father's eyes, but surely there's a bit of Rosemary in there too.",8,0,0,14 April 2016
Hercules," Aren't you a damsel in distress?
","Hercules visibly diverges from the darkness of its Greek mythology source material for a brighter, more hopeful tale. It posits that a hero is not just someone who does heroic deeds but can also place himself in front of others and sacrifice his own well-being for those who need it more. Pretty simply, sappy Hollywood stuff. But it works marvellously. Disney do not ever hold back on the camp, which is perhaps why it is able to be digested and enjoyed so easily. The gods of the Olympus are all clearly drawn, multicoloured caricatures - not withholding the power couple themselves, Zeus with his hulking, bulging muscles and the stick-thin, bright pink Hera. The sarcastic yet sultry Megara is animated in a way that is not subtle about each exaggerated swing of her hips, and it is enough to make Herc and other young boys' jaws drop. The scene-stealer is James Woods' Hades, who could have been brooding and muttering darkly from the shadows, but bursts into fits of rage and quips like a comedian gone mad. Too many adaptations have made Hades into a dark, humourless character, a baddie played straight. Woods brings attitude, and a fiery temper matched only by his quick wit. The same subversion is applied to the opening narration. Of course Disney would never let this be a mopey, grim story with dark undercurrents and pessimistic endeavours. The regularly employ the bait and stitch, drawing on the audience's knowledge of these tales and then pulling the rug from right under us. The best and funniest example of this happens at the climatic sacrifice on Hercules' part; he dives into Styx, wading through dead souls and withering away right before our eyes. Quiet a shock from the ever-grinning, bouncing action figure that has dominated much of the film. This is intercut with the Fates inching closer and closer to his life-line, the music ominously building...until they actually try to cut it and it just won't snap and they descend into mayhem in forcing the issue. A less inspired example would be the glowing Hercules abruptly caving in Hades' face without the slightest acknowledgement of the slapstick manner of the moment. Of course, nostalgia plays his part. I find myself noticing things that I had not previously. The film could have used another half hour; stretch out his young, fish-out-of-water existence, or the training montage that leads him to become an over-excited action figure. The CGI Hydra is an unavoidable element, and clashes so horribly with the rest of the clean-cut animation (though they have merged some of Herc's sword swings well). And there is one thing that most kids would not notice. The animation of the facial expressions is at times quite bizarre; it is like when you pause a video and inexplicably create a funny, morphed face, only these don't need pausing to pop up. It does not take too much away because the film's zaniness never slows down enough to be sensible. And the songs are still great. Go the Distance is intimate enough for Hercules, but targets a universal feeling that we all know too well.",8,1,2,26 May 2016
There Will Be Blood," What are you looking so miserable about?
","I wish more films would open like There Will Be Blood. Bleak, uncompromising and largely silent apart from the siren assault from Greenwood at the opening fade-in, the rise of Daniel Plainview is slowly and methodically unveiled. He starts as a primitive and solitary figure, propping himself up after an injury, then with a few workers (his family, as he calls them, and indeed one of the orphans becomes a part of his family), and only 15 minutes in do we finally get dialogue. It's a purposeful and seductive opening monologue from Daniel Day Lewis, the kind of rich and sonorous speech that is full of experience and trust and honour, but it doesn't fool the rowdy crowd. Realising they cannot be taken advantage of, he leaves and cannot be convinced to return. Plainview gives a similar, more evocative speech later on as he pitches to the residents of Little Boston, this time overlaid with visuals of a thriving communal effort from his workers and their families. And this one is vastly more successful. It's the strength of the performance that elevates the film into a captivating tale of greed and power. Paul Dano's Eli performs absurd exorcisms of spirits and ghosts, but through his own grand act and conviction, the congregation is enthralled, and so are we. And when Plainview says he is an oilman, we tend to agree. Apart from his steady deliberate speech (which fires up in fits of rage when appropriate) Plainview also possesses a distinctive walk, a hobbled gait that is perhaps the result of that horrible fall in his first mining venture. Or then again, perhaps it's a remarkably diligent performance. TWBB is built upon these kinds of precise acts of showmanship, and within them we revel at the battle between Plainview and Eli for the people. When Daniel buys a new dress for Mary and holds her little hands as she blesses the new oil well, it's quite lovely, but we only have eyes for Eli in the centre of the frame, stoic and unmoving, despite the lingering tension and anger between the lines. Eli gets one back when suggesting the death of one of the workers could have been prevented if he had been allowed to do the blessing, and of course this is escalated when H.W. is injured by the cursed well. Both are forced to break their character for financial gain, Plainview to buy that last piece of land for his pipeline ('I've abandoned my boy!' - but he admits it was worth it), and Eli desperate for money at his last days. It's remarkable how PTA can use one little accident to show us so many things. In his reaction Daniel shows a rare glimpse of humanity and desperation, even as we are forced to acknowledge HW's role in pitching his family company's vision. The pivotal scene is filmed appropriately in the chaos; the hand-held camera tremors and the sound design of the erupting gas and oil is guttural and thunderous, dulled only when we focus on the now deaf H.W. Here's where Greenwood's score excels; its percussion beats and frenzied strings arpeggios (some credit must go to Fratres by Arvo Pärt) provides such a heavy and ominous atmosphere, and yet that is equally juxtaposed by the gorgeous silhouette of Daniel and Fletcher celebrating in the shadow of the burning derrick. Fletcher asks of H.W.'s welfare, but as the camera slowly zooms in to a close up of Daniel, we know exactly what is capturing his gaze. It's truly a stunning achievement for DP Robert Elswit, who ranges from the harshly lit and bleak beginnings of Daniel Plainview's oil streaked face, to the rise of his vast sweeping oil empire, and to a dim and claustrophobic mansion that an elderly Plainview rots in. That ending is certainly a change from the vivid visuals that demonstrate the stink of the oil, the dry barren landscape and the years of hard work and toil that resulted in his wealth. The final psychotic scene in the bowling alley is tight and potent. Here we see two broken men, masked by wealth and religious virtue respectively, each empty. Daniel seizes the opportunity for revenge and humiliation by spurring on Eli to rebuke his lifelong performance, and Dano's increasing disturbance and discomfort as he raises his voice is so perfect. And so is the insane jeering and ramblings of a drunkard who, despite having everything, has nothing of substance. He renounces his remaining family ('bastard in a basket') after seeing a threat to his empire, and beats and bullies the pastor who he blames for his false promises of faith and healing and also the loss of his adopted son, the last living remnant of his humanity from years past. And with a sort of ambivalence in his final casual remark, the life of Daniel Plainview ends there, and Brahms' lively Violin Concerto bursts in. What There Will Be Blood does is allow us time to ponder and reflect. I have no need for the tiny sub-plot of the twin Sunday brothers, or the tired confession of Daniel to Henry of his misanthropy, drive and obsession. There's plenty of subtext in PTA's film-making to allow for us to dissect that from Day-Lewis. But even so, the film is an intensely visceral affair.",9,1,2,12 August 2015
Whiplash," Not quite my tempo
","Musicans and teachers alike will probably shy away from the methods which Terence Fletcher employ in Whiplash in the search for the next Charlie Parker. But it's fiction, and in that vein every single moment of the film is of course exaggerated for heightened tension. Oscar winner JK Simmons gives the performance of a lifetime as the brutal, cruel and authoritative jazz instructor who pushes his students to the limit and then some. It's a truly chilling character who gets equal parts of assistance and obstruction from the screenplay. Fletcher's frightful tirades are punctuated with moments of genuine kindness and humanity: playful anecdotes, saying hello to a little girl, playing soft jazz piano. Even more important is his reaction to one of his star pupil's deaths; a chilling realisation at the twist of the cause paints him in a very different light. But this stop start characterisation just sets up the audience for the inevitable foul-mouthed blow-up as contrivance after contrivance sees Andrew fail. Andrew, played by the ever impressive Miles Teller is at first a meek first year percussion student with big aspirations and even bigger dreams. He looks up to drumming legends and hopes to emulate their success; thus scoffing at his extended families' bragging of small time football achievements. While others are dismissive and his father ever supportive, Fletcher shares his goal. It's not the inspiring tale that some make it out to be; Fletcher is as petty as he is sadistic, pulling a fast one on Andrew in the final scene and getting his revenge for being fired from Schaffer. Andrew is just the first person to ever join him in his madness, to ever go beyond that limit and achieve true greatness at any cost. There's hurried montages of frenzied drumming which result in a bloodied and bandaged plunged into ice water - these are played out like aggressive training montages from a sports movie. It's a film which is intensely focused on the central two. Most secondary characters are given less significance; a symptom of Andrew's increasing desire and drive. One of these casualties is Nicole, the remarkably normal crush who gets swept aside when practice becomes more important. Melissa Benoist plays the part with touches of nervousness, awkward mannerisms and authenticity but it's suggestively a binary opposite just to show how motivated and obsessed Andrew is. This is very evident in his performance and the minimal costume and make-up which give him the withered, exhausted and bloodied look. Nicole enters and leaves his life like a shallow plot device used only to further push him into Fletcher territory. Another casualty is his father (Reiser), the supportive and kind single parent. The crux of Andrew's desire is to rise above the sympathetic hug with his father after his initial humiliation in the final scene. His father will always be there to say 'good enough' or 'good job', which is truly the bane of people like Fletcher and Andrew. For a moment he is humiliated and distraught, the steadicam switched for a shaky hand-held until he decides to walk back onto stage. The hand-held is not seen again. Whiplash's message is of course not for everyone. The bloody perseverance and alienation which comes at the cost of Andrew's musical greatness is not something many would be able to stomach. And beneath the passion of Terence Fletcher is a abusive and manipulative man who drives students to the brink. The final scene lavishes in their communal madness. There's a stark difference between the harsh and cold lighting of the very first drumming scene to here as he is bathed in warm light and a dizzy and shallow-focus close up shows every bead of sweat and every drop of blood that is the result of his work. He mouths a silent 'f*ck you' at Fletcher and launches into the intro for Caravan while each significant beat of the snare equates to a cut to another perspective of Carnegie Hall. Tom Cross deserves every amount of praise for his editing. It's contempt that slowly grows into approval as the camera swings rapidly from conductor to drummer, building momentum. There are truly only two people on the stage even as a series of rapid cuts shows various instruments. But Andrew goes beyond into a drum solo which stretches the limits of both him and Fletcher. If there were only two people on stage before, now there are only two people in the entire world. The audience is not seen again in the film. There's a fervid moment where Chazelle chooses silence over the intense beats of the drum; everything is slowed down, we get extreme close ups of ears, drums, sticks and of Andrew's face, clenched in concentration. Andrew smashes his cymbal so hard that Fletcher has to hurriedly fix it, nodding his head in admiration. They work together, they slow down, then they build. Silence is used again right before the end. Andrew looks up for that final nod, and we get a cut-off shot of half of Fletcher's face as he crinkles up in a smile. And with a last fanfare the film abruptly cuts to an end. Whiplash conjures a storm of desire, passion and tension between teacher and student. Other characters are left in the dust both metaphorically and literally in the frame as they finally combine to achieve greatness in the jazz world. Chazelle shoots with great emotion and frenzy which combines with the diegetic sound to produce one of the most dizzying and potent endings of recent times. Neither man cares about half measures or secondary prizes. It's paradoxically inspiring and downbeat at the same time yet never encourages the regime which the pair endure, or even lust for. Most will not shrug off real life consequences and physical barriers like a car crash. Most are just another Sean Casey.",8,4,6,10 June 2015
Stranger Than Fiction," You're asking me to knowingly face my death?
","Has Harold Crick ever gone out of his way to talk to someone (let alone a female) that wasn't part of his daily schedule before the film's fated events? My guess would be no. There are plenty of people like Harold that exist in real life - those in the menial, day to day grind, who are ordered about by routine and a strict adherence to it. Their lives are unspontaneous and uninteresting. That begs the question, is it worth pointing the camera this way and crafting a narrative about one of these types? We never really find out. In Stranger than Fiction, Karen Eiffel has written a modern masterpiece on his life and all its rigidly compartmentalised sections, but finds that the only way to give it the ending it deserves is to kill Harold off. This might be meaningful if we were given enough reason to wonder why. Eiffel's omniscient narrator flows in and out of the story without any real guidelines. Forster picks and chooses the moments of the film in which a thoughtful and contemplative voice-over might add to the emotion, or clash with Harold's apparent nonchalance. Dustin Hoffman is introduced to attempt to explain the phenomena, but even he cannot define it except in the vaguest of ideas. The concept is left to flounder. The ideal that any masterpiece must end with tragedy is a cliché and trite one, as is Thompson's insufferable caricature of the tortured artist, the dishevelled and weary body language, the angst of writer's block, the hopeless pessimism. Not to mention there is nothing at all remarkable about her flowery, waffly prose - the film stands on this idea that her story must be finished, because it is a vital and important piece of work. But we rarely see much of it at all, and are given no incentive to believe that Harold's demise would go towards a bigger, artistic cause. We are forced to cheer for someone who only writes only joyless, morose tragedies (sorry, masterpieces) and then inexplicably has a change of heart. The layering of the story, with Eiffel as the grand orchestrator and the narrative therefore altering depending on her mood, is something that the director might hide behind if the film draws criticism. What better method of dismissing any flaws by claiming they are the bland, uninspired ideas of the fictional struggling writer themselves? But at the end the film still manages to sabotage itself. Eiffel has presumably had a change of heart and wants to pen a more heartfelt, inspiring tale. That slow-mo montage with the sunshine and daisies and everything happy is as telling as it is. But where really is the change? Ferrell is played straight unlike his comedic man-child; too straight, in fact, because even as he throws himself in front of a bus or proclaims his love for the first time ever or even strums a guitar solo he is still the robotic character that has steadily worked its way through life all these years. There is no real motivation within but from Eiffel's pen, as if huge puppet strings are pushing him to do these things. Stranger than Fiction falls victim to its own clichés; it wants to portray real life as exciting and spontaneous as fiction, but ends up just re-visiting the same riffs over and over. There may be an intention to subvert somewhere hidden inside, but it is smothered by the simple existentialism crisis it presents and then quickly waves away. None of these characters have any substance and therefore agency to them. Ana is an uninspired caricature of the hippie that dropped out of college to start her own business - she has a few tattoos and wants to break tax laws because they are obviously some sort of government evil and that would go against her lifestyle. All it takes is a little guitar to make her jump straight into bed with a cardboard cutout. Though Harold Crick is let out of the cage to live his life, the film ironically is uptight - it doesn't allow for any other ending other than that overly saccharine, neat resolution. Many films have approached the idea of purpose and control within and outside the story. The Truman Show was one; that had visual meaning and layers that this does not. Adaptation was another, also about a writer unable to finish a story. But it did not take the easy way out.",5,0,2,21 May 2016
The Lion King," Through despair and hope
","When marketing The Lion King for the first time way back in 1994, Disney made the brave decision to have its first cinematic trailer consisting entirely of the opening sequence of the film. It's a decision that highlighted the enormous strength and beauty of that opening scene where the animals of the Pridelands gather for the coronation of young Simba while the iconic Circle of Life accompanies his introduction. It's a gorgeous spectacle of animation and music which immediately grips the audience's attention and establishes the setting. The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments. The voice acting is unique and enduring. The booming bass tones of James Earl Jones makes for a imposing father figure in Mufusa, in contrast to Jeremy Irons' Scar, rich with haughty disdain for his pride-mates. A fun filled exile in the middle of the film is characterised by that of the jovial Timon and Pumbaa, while young Simba's voice grows into the deeper tones of Matthew Broderick, during an excellent and colour filled montage over Hakuna Matata. The three hyena cronies of Scar are also distinct despite their ugly cloned appearances, boasting the voice work of Whoopi Goldberg, Marin and Cummings as the overly enthusiastic, sassy and hot-headed henchmen. The story is a simple if not effective one, drawing upon similar themes from Hamlet. It's a tale of Simba's quest for redemption and revenge after being falsely exiled for his father's death. The traditional coming of age plot is well paced and is earmarked by several deeply emotional moments, the most significant of those being Simba's grief at the realisation of his father's death (Jonathan Taylor Thomas's voice acting in this scene is heartbreaking). There's plenty of emotional depth in the portrayal of Simba through the themes of ostracization, loss, guilt and growing up which makes this film appropriate for both adult and children alike. The Lion King has a rightful place in Disney's elite as a vibrant, poignant and visually immersive film.",9,2,2,26 June 2015
Lord of War," How do we arm the other 11?
","There are grander and more complex ideas in the opening and close of Lord of War than in any of the minutes that are sandwiched by them. They posit that Yuri Orlov is like any other toiler of their trade, merely a tiny cog in a finely oiled machine that will chug on no matter who is delivering the goods or pulling the trigger. It's a sobering and frightening thought, although for Yuri he is less tiny than he might like to think. The role asks for a master of deflection and thin justifications. Cage has a logical answer for any challenge, a tight-lipped smile for any moral quandary, although in the end it is again about money. Would he be a more interesting character if there was more to this motivation? It is structured like certain Scorsese films, with the man perched high on his domain, flaunting his wealth and influence directly to the audience via narration, flashing luxury and excess until we are also somewhat entranced. But Niccol ultimately resists this direction, and the result is a rather muddled moral tale that lacks spine. He goes in the more serious direction. He could have posed Yuri as a Henry Hill or a Jordan Belfort, have him go out guns blazing into a satire at full tilt. And indeed there are flashes of this potential; the stirring strings of Ride of the Valkyries at a military show, how the giving away of guns is handled like children flocking to a free ice-cream truck, and the way Yuri covets the end of the Russian communist state, not because of any political idealism, but because of how much guns and tanks he can now resell for a fat profit. Could any other actor besides Nicholas Cage pull off kissing Gorbachev like he does? Coincidentally he is a man of many talents, and can also play the opposite, the straight man with a vein of dark humour running through him. He is a showmanship through and through, which means he is in the right business, at least until the mundane trappings of domesticity come for him. War may be the ultimate business to Yuri, but even guns cannot be his first love. Using the tools and deceptions of his trade he woos his childhood crush, and eventually finds some semblance of settling down. It is here that Niccol tries to craft a conflict; most men wouldn't be flying around the world dealing with firearms if they had Bridget Moynahan to come home to, but of course Yuri isn't most men. Running guns is supposed to consume him, but the problem is that there isn't much to consume in the first place. Ava is, as she herself admits, nothing more than a pretty face, and the extended family is neatly tucked away someplace where only a occasion phone call can reach. The other quandary is the moral one, which cannot be ignored in such a macabre affair. Though Yuri might attempt to distance himself from the consequences of his trade by way of clumsy metaphor (gun-running is compared to everything from losing your virginity to peddling vacuum cleaners) at the end of the day he must still confront what his guns are doing. Two figures are played off the coldness of Yuri; his brother, a coke-head who nevertheless sees things a little clearer than his older brother (as in, not just in dollar signs), and the rugged Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke woefully miscast as the righteous, lawful type, and with a terrible name to boot). But the film tales the easy sentimental route, showing us nothing new. We already know that Yuri is fooling no one with his talks of 'I'm not the one pointing the gun'. His one-liners ('At least mine have a safety switch') might have a brief zeal but in the end we aren't charmed by this equal opportunity merchant of death. Yuri, at the start and by the end, has already convinced himself of no wrongdoing, but can he convince the viewer? Well, he certainly gives it a good shot.",6,1,2,2 October 2016
Finding Dory," Mommy likes blue shells...
","If anything Finding Dory does a pretty good job of connecting the dots to its predecessor. This does not feel like a sequel forced by the executive's hand but rather the natural extension of Dory's own journey. When she breaks down near the end of Finding Nemo because Marlin has given up hope and is left to drift alone in the oceans, there is a suggestion that there is more to uncover for her character than just her goofy, comedian-voiced antics. But that film was about Nemo - this one is about Dory's origins. For much of the film it relies and retreads the same emotional ground as Finding Nemo did. On its own, it does quite well. The young Dory is practically cuteness overload, with big bug eyes nearly bulging out from the eye sockets and strategically mispronounced words which instantly paint her vulnerability as well as Nemo's little fin did many years ago - admittedly without Newman's gentle, floating title track, which again is familiar, but dulled. The loss is meant to be tragic, and we are supposed to sympathise. Is it a mistake to be overly familiar? Andrew Stanton is asking us to offer the same emotional stakeholds, but has fallen short of giving us the same story and characters worth rooting for.The film's climax is the most egregious offender. The basic principle behind both is that the child is once again going off to commit a daring rescue - Dory launching herself into the truck, and Nemo into the fishing net. The conflict arises from the parent(s) not wanting to part with their child after such a long time apart. But for Marlin this rings so much truer. We've swam alongside him across the entire east coast, through jellyfish masses, in complete trench darkness, away from a minefield inhabited by semi-vegetarian sharks, even in a whale's mouth. For Marlin to go through all that and then once again let Nemo slip would be agonising. The fact that it was Nemo's own incompetence that led to his capture makes it doubly meaningful - only by finally trusting his son's now improved judgement can he begin to grow and learn himself (we see a little of that here too). It's a very delicately constructed dilemma, and fraught with tension. We get little of that in Finding Dory, however. The moment between Dory and her parent's reluctance is short-lived, and besides the point. Instead of a thoughtful and character building scene we get a wacky action set- piece that never ever seems actually tense or life-threatening. The octopus-driven truck can weave in and out of traffic or go round and round in circles for as long as the jokes need it to be, but we are never made to doubt that Dory will make it back to the ocean. Nemo and Marlin's inclusions almost seem questionable, in fact. The row which separates the group is minuscule and insignificant; Dory swam a little too fast and Nemo gets hit on the head. This is enough to open up old wounds and grievances about Dory being a complete airhead, which have been apparently bubbling under for over a year. But in the space of a day it is all neatly resolved, with a vague aspiration that sometimes her crazy antics might seem useful. This varying degree of chaos versus helpfulness is noticeably contrived, especially when it involves hair-raising aquatic acrobatics that make Gill's escape plan look like a little tumble in the park. It's cartoon of course, so these things are forgivable - what isn't is the implication that Dory's wackiness is some magic mantra that will somehow get you where you need to go. Finding Dory's strengths lie in its visuals and humour. Whilst the predecessor broken ground with its water animation, Pixar have gone above and beyond that to present an eye-poppingly gorgeous world that prompts the audience to once again race to the nearest aquarium (and have the new generation of kids excitedly point out 'There's Nemo!'). It isn't quite as photo-realistic as its preceding short, but nevertheless looks stunning. Stanton has also shown the ability to build on at least some of the elements that he previously mastered. We had psycho Darla with Hitchcock music and all, but here we have a very original and humorous gag involving a touch pool where fingers becomes exploding landmines and the fish all experience waves of PTSD from the roaming little hands. Overall Finding Dory is competent as far as Pixar standards go - it hits the right emotional beats without complete reliance on the already familiar backstory, and is bright and colourful enough to bring in the attractive box office numbers. But its best feature must be reminding me just how great Finding Nemo was and still is. Has sunlight hitting the ocean sand ever looked so gorgeous?",7,3,13,21 June 2016
Parasite," Well, lots of people live underground.
","Parasite comes to us in an age where the intersection between art and politics seems to be reaching fever pitch; the moving screen has become a battleground for representation and polemic, and the arguments that stem from the validity of just that become their own dogfights. Films wrest for their spotlight via the award season. The media chimes in with their own ceremonies and ribbons. Every man and his dog and his dog's twitter account has a voice, and those tweets may well qualify for Rotten Tomatoes critic status. And at times, the noise surrounding a film can impair our ability to discern its true qualities.Todd Phillips' Joker made the biggest splash throughout 2019, with an array of voices vying for control of the narrative. Some critics derided its dangerous allure to the Arthur Flecks of our time, ticking time bombs waiting to pull their own talk-show stunts, whereas the director himself bemoaned the 'woke culture' that had ruined the comedic genre. While he's not wrong about the disconnect between imagined violence and real crime (in the end, no clowns armed with AR-15s showed up at the premiere), surely Phillips has to realise the slippery slope of interpretation that his film endorses. As a straight-forward character study of Fleck's descent into unhinged derangement, it's sympathetic enough, if not clumsy in its social commentary, mimicking the aesthetic of its Scorsese inspirations from the New Hollywood era in exchange for diluting its contemporary relevance. But as serious critique it's laughable, simplifying society's sickness to a scattershot of seriously specific symptoms. These range from a gang of teenage hooligans hunting clown sign holders (and only clown sign holders) to a pair of cruel Wall Street bankers who coinkidinkily happen to know a full verse and chorus of Send in the Clowns, a song that has zero relevance to the scenario other than its title - that's Glee level, Todd. While Scorsese's camera turned away out of embarrassment for Travis Bickle, Joker revels in its final triumph, consoling its audience's edgiest sympathies. A brief glance at the YouTubers serenading the 167th Street stairs confirms this. It's brand store nihilism, broad enough for anyone to latch onto with their worldly angst.Relatively, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is more consistent in its overall delivery, spinning social parable from the familiar yarn of a classic whodunnit. The moral is solidified in the final frame, where the immigrant carer surveys her new estate (a labyrinthine, Clue-esque mansion) from its top balcony, towering above the former employers who held her family ransom. But although its interactions strike truer (it's gratifying to see the Thrombey clan cajole Marta as 'part of the family', only to sharply change tack when she is granted their entire inheritance, exposing their actual priorities), the story places the othered outsider on such a pedestal that it feels obligatory to side with her. Marta can't even tell a lie without vomiting, wielded by Johnson as a clever plot device, and yet also a characteristic approaching noble savage levels of patronising. The spatial metaphor isn't dissimilar to that of the staircase in Parasite, but you wish that it had a shade more nuance, and that she wasn't just the straight character in a pulpy film where the rest of the ensemble seems ripped out a 21st century version of Clue. In this edition of the board game, Marta wins by playing the moral high ground at every turn. But real life isn't that easy, or that simple.As far as Bong Joon-ho is concerned, politics has always been entwined with the big screen. Because the latter is designed to captivate the popular audience, surely it must be a reflection of their general wants and needs, universal concerns and priorities. Some of his more pointed 'monster movies' take direct aim at the injustices of the world: the ramifications and pitfalls of American exceptionalism in The Host, and the cruel disregard for animal rights by multinational conglomerates in Okja. From his worldview, profit rises above the rest, leaving all behind. But Parasite isn't as straightforwardly didactic, or as easy to summarise. Just when you think you have the film's measure, that the Kims have beaten the system by assuming their mantle on the throne of the Parks, it swerves violently to the left.From the very beginnings of his career, Joon-Ho has been taking genre films and twisting them into social satire, and while the first half of Parasite could operate as a straight thriller on its own, the latter half upends its foundations beyond a merely literal sense. The cast is uniformly excellent, and it is through the Kims that Joon-Ho begins to form his thesis; that class is performative, that being is a constant state of code-switching, and that anyone could find themselves at the bottom of the basement or the top of the stairs, at one point or another in the twisted prism of capitalism. There is an entire wealth of nuance in the formal and informal registers of Korean that will be forever lost to foreign audiences, but their body language and tone tell a whole story of their own; how Ki-woo is seduced by the allure and esteem of a university tutor and in turn seduces Ji-so, feigning aloofness while in awe of her status, or how So-dam's dialogue pokes through upper class formality (while her father fails to bridge this gap), or how Chung-sook swells above the former housekeeper when she talks down to her, scolding the unemployed for not knowing their place. When the new head of house nudges the old aside as if she were nothing more than a pesky mosquito, our laughter is smothered quickly by the crack! of her head against concrete, a testament to both the film's careful drip of dark humour and the lateral cruelty inflicted at the bottom tier of society, driven by a desperate yearning to ascend and escape.Joons-Ho's visual style is a slick, almost insidious thing, willing you subconsciously in the direction of the narrative and to where the power resides within the scene. Consider the opening shot of his debut, Barking Dogs Never Bite, which pulls back from an idyllic forest line to trap the protagonist within the frame, imprisoned in a cage of unemployment and yelping neighbouring dogs. The closing shot pulls the same trick, presenting his success at scoring the coveted title of a university professor, before pulling back to replace the old bars of his apartment with a new set. He has won, but at what cost? Parasite begins literally below ground level, showing you the world as the Kims see it, the veritable vermin of the underground. The camera squeezes in with them hunched around their dining table, the long lens compressing the planes, evoking a feeling of claustrophobia. When Ki-woo makes his initial ascent, the frame expands, dwarfing him in the gated community of the Parks, bathing him in angelic natural light. Only when their gambit is exposed do they scurry back into their murky sewers like rats, flushed out by the same waters that preserve the pristine pastures of their employers. And yet, they commit the same sins, and are guilty of the same transgressions they scorn the Parks for.Parasite finishes with a door slam of an ending, exposing the elusiveness of social mobility as absolute. In truth, I prefer the agony of the close in Burning from compatriot Lee Chang-dong, which achieves the same order of anguish that Joon-ho tapped into with Memories of Murder (its impact somewhat lessened by the recent revelation of the real-life perpetrator). In the end, it is infinite obsession which reigns over the resolution of the plot's puzzle, laced with the poison of class envy; it matters not who Ben really was. Parasite more or less deals with a similar crisis of identity, in which the working class protagonist eventually succumbs to the lure of the nouveau riche and their shiny new world. If you pull back, you'll see that this doubles for the broader anxieties of a country coming to terms with its rapid economic and social growth after civil war. Winning the nation's first, second, third, and fourth Oscar in one fell swoop is a significant boon for Asian representation in the West. And as for working class representation? Perhaps not in the gilded, gated halls of the Academy. Even in fantasy, Ki-woo's triumph barely nudges the status quo. He merely wins by joining them.",9,2,3,6 March 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An unexpected side effect of desperation - success
","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) will be seen by many as an example of art imitating life. Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a washed up and forgotten Hollywood star years on after his success with the superhero blockbuster trilogy Birdman, some equating this to Keaton's Batman. However, this is irrelevant in judging the merits of the movie itself.The clash of theatre vs. Hollywood and art vs. meaningless blockbuster trash is a very prominent theme within the movie but one must be careful not to immediately place them in a dichotomy as renowned theatre critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) does to Keaton's revival, a play he directs, writes and stars in. The same dichotomy is evident in Riggan's mind right from the word go; the menacing voice-over questions his life with 'How did we end up here?'. It's a few minutes into the film that we then learn his full head of hair is nothing but a wig, and that the voice belongs to the ever present persona of Birdman, the manifestation of Riggan's niggling self doubt at his attempts to become more than just a movie star. While impressively visceral, it may be interesting to study whether the removal of the voice-over would benefit the characterisation of Riggan, maybe magnifying his emotional breakdown mid-film where he talks over the Birdman persona and trashes his dressing room over the loss of control of his play. Nevertheless, later when Birdman physically manifests on screen within Riggan's mind, it is a majestic display. The one-take illusion of the film's cinematography means the film takes place in mostly cramped back-stages and rooms for the first two thirds, only relishing in wide angles and dynamic crane shots to showcase Riggan's acceptance of Birdman as he soars above and around New York. It is also one of the rare times the score deviates from the sporadic crescendo of the drums for a melodramatic orchestral piece that would not sound out of place at the close of a romcom or family film.Emmanuel Lubezki's work in digitally weaving together separate takes to form the illusion of a single continuous take has had mixed reactions. Some have derided it as nothing more than a gimmick and adding nothing of value to the film. The choice to express every scene in this way makes way for some interesting decisions in terms of camera movement. In one particularly gripping scene, Riggan stumbles upon her daughter Sam (Emma Stone), recently out of rehab, and smells pot. The conversation descends into a vehement and biting rant on the futility of her fathers ambitions and career, perhaps one of Stone's finest performances. Yet one might wonder the difference had the camera chosen to instead focus on Riggan's reaction instead. Nevertheless both actors demand the attention of the camera throughout the film. The look of regret upon Sams face moments afterwards is telling. In another pivotal scene, Riggan's character within his play, Mel, is giving a passionate monologue on the ideal of love using the example of an elderly couple involved in a car crash. Mel rises from the table and takes centre-stage in an almost over-extravagant manner, the shot cutting out the three other characters in the play. It's a clear stylistic choice by Riggan to push his acting stock and showcase his own talent, much in the same way that the tacked on ending of the suicide of Mel is. Riggan takes quite a few liberties in his stage adaptation of Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. Finally, the one-take illusion allows (or confines, if you prefer) the scenes of Riggan walking backstage to straight, eye levels shots of the long corridors. Naturally then, when Riggan speeds up the camera also speeds up, working in conjunction with the beats of the snare drum to build dramatic tension. Opposite Riggan is the arguably even more egotistical Broadway actor in Mike (Edward Norton), who portrays a version of the extremely dedicated method actor, often the source of the black comedy's sparse humour with the lengths he goes to achieve realism on the stage. When an unexpected erection interrupts his bedroom performance during a preview, the audience laughs along with those in the real world. Mike's antics constantly clash with Riggan's play and his vision. He lambasts the appearance of the prop guns, and demands to consume real gin on stage, yet brings much needed popularity and audiences to the play. Riggan's conflict is clear; he desires the fame and success of Mike, yet cannot be taken seriously within the theatre world with his Hollywood past. Norton plays the part to perfection, as a cocky, confident and sometimes pretentious thorn in Riggan's backside, flaunting his easy hold over the critics. Birdman is not without its flaws. The sideplot of Riggan and his partner (also fellow actor) Laura feels like excess and underdeveloped. This results in a very forced and shoehorned lesbian scene between Laura and the fourth star of the play Lesley (Naomi Watts) which hints at the broken relationship of Riggan and Laura, then is immediately dismissed. Riggan and Sam's backstory is developed through exposition via ex-wife Sylvia, and therefore unfolds in an uneven manner from conflict to comfort, seemingly skipping whole swathes of conversation. The whole concept of the title 'the virtue of ignorance' is discussed briefly from a newspaper and comes off as a rather empty justification for Riggan's 'ultra realism' and his final actions. The ending is a interesting matter of interpretation. For me, it's a billboard of Riggan Sam is smiling at, a true sign of his eventual success removed from Birdman. His career is taking new flight. Or maybe the whole scene, including the symbolic removal of the mask/bandages is a daydream of a happy man in a hospital bed. For the record, I thought Keaton was hilarious in The Other Guys.",8,3,10,20 January 2015
Platoon," Something from Ecclesiastes
","So it seems to me that the ideals of Platoon are to be anti-war...to not ascribe any blame towards the overtly political powers that drove this war but to centre it on the human aspect of the soldier itself, and how it loses its humanity. Sheen's bleary, self-serious voice- over narration says so as much - that the enemy was within themselves, the violence from their own hearts. And Stone collaborates this idea with his visuals; there is scarcely a clear shot of a Vietnamese soldier, guns blazing. The danger is all around them, but it is murky and indistinct, and the paranoia settles into the platoon quite easily, and begins to affect them. There is no logic or reason to the madness, to the hysteria of the violence, to the casual beckoning of death itself after a few weeks in the jungle. The problem is that Sheen's storyline doesn't fit this message at all. Stone tries to avoid pointing the blaming finger, and attempts to rid the film of any structure or cause or journey just because we might expect it from a movie. But in doing so he inadvertently creates a coming-of-age story that just so happens to be set during the Vietnam War. Taylor goes in a fresh-faced youth, having idealised the soldier life and cast away the bores of college, and immediately finds himself out of his depth. And then he has to go through the usual rigours of gaining acceptance within the group and finding his feet, and shaping his own philosophy. The choice that Stone has presented here is a insultingly simplistic one; the scarred, savage Barnes who shoots first and asks questions later, who Taylor unsurprisingly initially worships and who has half of the platoon following his violent, racist ways. And then you have the literal hippie, Dafoe's disillusioned, goody two-shoes veteran that later befriends Taylor and stops the atrocity at the village. There's not much engagement even for Taylor - one moment he is deliriously taunting the villager with his gun and even close to shooting him, and following that, nearly speaks out on the massacre and then stops the gang-rape of some girls. Stone wants these moral decisions to be grounded within visceral, graphic images of war, but doesn't commit to it; the rape is only hinted at from off-screen, and as Bunny smashes the elderly woman's head open, it surely is a sight for Taylor to recoil from, but we don't see it. Even when the group discover the gory end of Manny, Stone spends more time pointing the camera at the horrified reactions instead. Many critics have praised it for its realism, its fuzzy, indistinct boundaries of warfare that do not glorify the combat, do not make it exhilarating but chaotic and confusing for all involved. But Stone's film is full of these cinematic moments that betray his intent - Sheen's cliché-ridden voice-over becomes quickly insufferable because it assumes so much of the other characters without ever giving evidence of their 'heat and soul'. There's that wishy-washy poetic speech from Dafoe the night before the chaos and mayhem that just happens to take place underneath a beautiful star-filled sky and a stupid shooting star. Later he is the figure of perhaps the worst scene in the film, his own death, stumbling for his life as he is riddled with Vietnam bullets in slow-motion and Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings swells to peak sentimentality and it's almost unwatchable.",5,3,5,27 March 2016
Paths of Glory," Ready to kill some Germans?
","Observe how simple percussion is used in Kubrick's Paths of Glory to build tension. Three men creep out in the dead of night on a reconnaissance mission. There is only sparse moonlight to guide them, brief flares illuminated the corpse strewn battlefield. The uneven bass drum beats sound again and again, while the pattering of the snare mimics their slow progress, sliding over dirt and blood and mud. Then with a sudden cut and a clattering of the cymbals, a Lieutenant has killed his own man in a fit of cowardice. Later, the slow and steady drum beats again lead us through the progressions of an execution by firing squad. It is painfully slow and elaborate, sacrificial like, the way they determinedly prop up the wounded body and dehumanise him. We wait agonisingly for reprieve, for the general to intervene, and do not get it. This film is concerned with two distinct worlds. One is the bureaucratic higher ups, the generals and commanding officers who remain spotless in the face of such atrocities. The others are those nameless soldiers who are treated as a number; 100 yards for 1000 men. As we track General Mireau through the grimy trenches, he remains quite physically and mentally distant from the men he so heroically commends. They flinch as explosions nearly breach the trenches every now and again; Mireau hardly notices, because he will be soon back in the comfort of his office. Georg Krause captures the setting in all its drab, freezing and gray misery; there are no fancy angles, no playing with depth of field. One shell-shocked soldier does not respond quite as heroically as he would like, looking off camera as he shows symptoms of cracking his hard persona. He is reprimanded and dismissed; soldiers are not meant to act this way. One man ventures into both world, the leading figure in Colonel Dax, played with steel by Kirk Douglas. He is the absolute moraliser, heroic and brave, but he is only one man. In an extended sequence, he leads the regiment over the trenches and into a suicide mission. The camera tracks him in a wide angle as he brandishes a small pistol and futilely blows a whistle, easily outmatched by the explosions of blood and dirt and shrapnel, as dead bodies crumple all around and bullets hiss pass ears with a metallic sound. Mireau watches from afar with binoculars, bewildered by why they are retreating. Dax knows these horrors, and they are the basis for that great impassioned monologue in the courthouse, where he pleads to superiors who have not experienced the trenches to spare these 'cowardly' men. The only brave man is a dead man, the prosecutor snaps. They are of a different world; no better visualised than that long tracking shot of Broulard which displays the lavish dance and banquet in stark contrast to what we have witnessed. These are the men who easily rationalise the lives of soldiers and calculate as if they were empty faces, the men who think of promotions, not lives spared. Dax is far too conventional for Kubrick's taste, which is perhaps why his protests and actions are ultimately unavailing. He is stoic in his futility, unblinking and all seeing - whereas the camera always presents Mireau from the outside, immaculately dressed and self-important (notice the lovely little protest he at first gives, then easily is swept aside: 'What is my ambition compared to that? My men come first...'), we are immersed in Dax's POV. He sees every tremble and flinch of the soldiers he commands, and does not want to go ahead with this mission. He does find a small consolation; he forces Roget to face his crimes, and in doing so exposes a rather meek apology, too little too late. A rabble of soldiers gather in a bar. They are drunk and rowdy, and even more so when a teary and clearly uncomfortable German girl is ushered onto stage from them to ogle. They jeer and make lewd requests, ridiculing her for her gender and nationality. This is a young Christiane Kubrick who delivers a heartbreaking scene; she stutters but somehow manages to quell the noise, urging them to hum along to a German folk song. Here is a brief moment of shared humanity. Oh how swiftly it will be taken away.",10,1,3,7 October 2015
Back to the Future Part II," Nobody calls me chicken!
","It seems pretty clear that there never was a sequel planned for Back to the Future, but as many hit films do, the money rolled in and the executives demanded more. Zemeckis was then left with the awkward situation of having to live up to the fantastic teased ending of the original, which hampers the plot of this one significantly. The most telling sign of this is the fact that they had to somehow write Jennifer into the plot again (and recast and reshoot too) - so we have a sort of introduction to the McFly family of the future, with gags and tricks and all, and then what could've been a promising storyline dissolves into yet another Biff v Marty battle again. early on, Jennifer is literally put to sleep and dumped onto the street because she is merely an accessory for the plot. Nevertheless, the future does bring some awe-inspiring new visuals that shows that Zemeckis is clearly in his element regarding this area. Four years on and with more financial freedom meant a lot more than just the quick hovercar hint we had previously been wowed with. Again he uses that dramatic crane reveal, and inserts the same little clues that we saw back in 1955 in Hill Valley; a bionic Mayor Goldie, sleek cars on road and flying high in the skies, lifelike holographic sharks, the same café now as a vintage novelty etc. Everything is composited so smoothly and seamlessly - there's a rather excellent bit of visual effects in the background of the café window, as Biff and his gang land their car down from the air and stroll in. Another director might have just shot them walking in through the door, but this little bit of magic makes it all the more immersive - aside bizarre futuristic fashion designs and video games that need hands to operate (Just one of the correct predictions of our times).It is a pity that the ingenuity of the visual effects does not match the characters that it serves. In BTTF, Biff was a minor character, a bully but not a prominent case study in himself. Here, we have 4 Biffs in the café, dressed ludicrously, and all spitting the same insults and wanting to exact the same physical punishments. Later on, the entire timeline is altered because of a rogue elderly Biff and suddenly his character is much more present. Sure, the image of the towering and immense Pleasure Paradise is stunning, but the overall changes to this alternate timelines become almost mean spirited, something that the original film did not represent. If the future bully Biffy was spastic and thuggish, this one is cartoonishly evil - at one point he even descends to broadcasting his entire origins of success to our hero before attempting to finish him. And to open it all, we have not a bizarrely humorous situation where Marty is mistaken for an alien and his ufo, but an angry man with a bat who destroys everything in an over-the-top manner. And why is Mr Strickland the target of drive by shootings? It is a mystery; he is simply another errant cameo. The Marty of the past was a hero, short in stature and quick to know when he was outmatched. This time, Fox is the same, but there are some weird moments of characterisation that seem to go against everything established in the sequel. Twice, Biff calls him a chicken, and twice, Marty freezes in his stance and dramatically turns around and gives this glare to a rather inane schoolboy insult. And the older Marty is in on it too. Since when is Marty highly strung and reactive to those who question his bravery, nevertheless being questioned by the worst of bullies? And why is Fox the one playing his future daughter? The makeup in this series has always been of a high quality, but it seems this is just showing off rather than creating a substantial character. There are snippets of a meaningful storyline in the conversations about how Marty lost his ability and passion to play music and descended into the corporate world, but it seems Biff has a high priority. This is a rather disappointing sequel. For the all the great gags like the power laces (Alright!), the hydrating pizza (Who's going to eat all that?), the split-screen TV and the ever desired hoverboard that continues to elude us well after October 21 2015, there's not much to really enjoy.",6,0,0,19 January 2016
The Iron Giant," I am not a gun.
","It is 1957 in the small town of Rockwell, Maine, and America is in the midst of the Cold War, so naturally this gives the film an aura of unsettledness and paranoia. And also naturally, children are less concerned with this, and take more risks, and their naivety leads to some unforeseen consequences. Brad Bird sprinkles a little social commentary in it too; sometimes it's delightfully light like the mock educational short film that displays the proper nuclear bombing etiquette to school children, or it's loud and brusque like the panicked way that G-man Kent Mansley defers to military action and presence whenever possible. We have the usual children's film conventions which signal themselves loudly: the lone boy who is bullied and causes trouble beyond his intentions, the snappy but good natured mother who glares at him pointedly after this fiasco, and the rest of the town, adult and children alike, whom do not believe his tall tale of a giant robot from outer space. What saves it from being generic is Brad Bird's direction which creates charm and genuine childhood terror and discovery without being juvenile. He does this first and foremost in the animation. Hogarth is given due attention, especially to his facial expressions which are given a wide range of lopsided smiles, glares, creased grimaces and wide eyed stares; see as his feet motor on Looney Tunes style when he attempts to flee the robot, or a particularly lively moment where he tries to pray whilst shooing the robot out of the house (not an uncommon scansion in children's films but it is done well, with restraint and with just the right amount of humour). The same goes for the robot, digitally animated but made to look hand drawn, whom moves with a slow but endearing recklessness. In one particular moment, he is spoken to like a child, or a dog, as he refuses to stop following Hogarth. Vin Diesel's pitch dropped, monotonous voice acting is perfect for this sort of misguided character, and has helped cement the film's iconic lines ('You stay. I go.') The discovery of the robot initially is handled with great nuance. Though it may be a child who stumbles across it, it isn't overly cartoonish and generates just the right amount of wonder and apprehension. The first sighting is this gigantic low angle shot of its eyes lighting up the lighting storm and it is genuinely awe inspiring and terrifying. Then later, this is replicated in his second appearance, before he gets stuck and we first feel something that resembles sympathy, and this comes easier for a child. Kamen's score is also crucial; a lively percussive based piece as Hogarth dresses up as a soldier and prepares himself for battle, thrilling as Hogarth flees and then makes his decision to save the robot, and in the finale, twinkles optimistically before flourishing in full fanfare to give us the ending we all hoped for. And finally the sound design which is just as important in building the characterisation of the robot and the initial anticipation of a non-threat; a big creaky whoosh as the robot crouches down to Hogarth's level, without menace, then a gigantic boom as it falls over onto its bottom, and the entire screen, and each layer of trees in the background shakes vigorously. It is not hard to see why The Iron Giant has become a cult classic. It does not have the iconicity or the Spielberg draw of E.T., but its story is just as touching and heartfelt. Brad Bird has in time shown his animation mastery with his Pixar work in The Incredibles and Ratatouille, but this remains an important stepping stone. Who knew that a linguistically challenged, lumbering giant robot could becomes such an endearing superhero figure?",8,1,1,9 January 2016
Mary and Max," You are my best friend. You are my only friend.
","Mary and Max never lets the viewer settle into a preconceived idea of how the story and characters will act based on the rotund and plump clay figurines who waddle about in the gorgeous and painstakingly detailed world of Adam Elliot's. It's not as smooth as a bigger budgeted animation piece like Wallace & Gromit is but the clay- mation is nevertheless enchanting. The depiction of two worlds apart in New York City and Lamington Drive, Australia consists of hundreds of miniature props and set pieces and even a fully functional tiny typewriter in which Max composes his letters to. The character and set design is whimsical and the film's voice-over, which dictates the majority of the plot points and exposition, is punctuated with absurdities, dark humour and bits of everyday questioning. At surface level, the premise of a middle aged, obese and lonely atheist with Aspergers syndrome being penpals with an equally lonely and bullied eight year girl is simple and easily dissected. The film, unlike many animations, is not bursting with colours or rainbows, instead washed in black and white or a murky brown, with the odd bit of red in the tongues or pom-poms or hair-clips. So that it itself hints at the darker nature of the film. Part of the charm and authenticity of the premise comes from the excellent voice acting from Max and Young Mary, by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bethany Whitmore respectively. Hoffman's raspy, matter-of-fact voice over is carefully punctuated by pauses in his speech that indicate a simple, if not, curious mind. It's simultaneously a man who feels like time is running out in his life yet has all the time in the world for his only friend in the world. This makes him a perfect correspondence for Mary, where Whitmore's voice feels like a genuine child's not riddled with clichés and over-age understanding. She stumbles on the spelling of certain words and adds grammatical mannerisms of her own to the characterisation of her innocence and curiosity. Much like Max, she also experiences loneliness, and it is through this common emotion they find their connection. The soundtrack lends itself to both humour and drama throughout the film. Insignificant deaths like a mime being crushed by a air-conditioning unit or a careless father drowned at sea might be morbid in other films but become an eventuality in Mary and Max. The dark humour is created by the reactions of the characters, not by dialogue, but by clever sound design and facial animation which adds an air of absurdity to the scene. See the irony in the cuts between a whooshing falling air-conditioner unit and the soundless mime bracing for impact, or the outrageous cry of Max upon seeing cigarette butt littering, or the matter-of-fact way in which he admits guilt after farting in a public elevator. Penguin Cafe Orchestra's Perpetuum Mobile is the perfect theme for the film, introducing us to the setting as well as chiming in here and there again to remind us of a moment of character growth or determined action. It's a beautiful composition which gives a sense of time passing, and of the juxtaposition between sad and happy moments. Another strong and emotionally resonant moment uses musical cues to great effect, being Mary's attempted suicide. It's one of the few instances in the film where the camera actually moves away from it's rather pedestrian positioning and where digital effects are used to portray the last moments of Mary's life and the surreal experience of the old cliché where your life flashes before your eyes. Doras Day's old classic Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) adds emotional depth and subtext to the moment, linking back to Mary's negligent upbringing and conjuring ideas of adulthood failure and lost friendship. Mary and Max's friendship is never face to face but shines throughout the brilliant screenplay which creates a connection through the bizarre, witty and oddities that they share. It's two remarkably curious perspectives of life and loneliness which bring them together. It's heartfelt and funny in it's dark humour (When I was young, I invented an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli. My psychiatrist says I don't need him anymore, so he just sits in the corner and reads); there's as much emotional resonance as there is comic relief. It treats it's darker topics of mental illness and suicide with maturity that often goes amiss in animation features. One might wonder how rapidly paced a friendship this might be had the film be set in more modern times with the accessibility of instant messaging and emails. Mary and Max however delivers a delightful little tale that's more than evenly paced.",9,4,8,12 July 2015
Mary and Max," We don't get to choose our warts.
","Films like Mary and Max come along so rarely that when they do, they must be hugged tightly and treasured. For those with an aversion to gritty social realism, it is a tonic for the soul. It is a tale so delicate that it might shatter if nudged lightly, a whimsical take on how an eight year old girl and an autistic man find lifelong friendship through a chance encounter. Their decade and longer correspondence proves crucial to the power of the ending's revelation: we do not get to choose our warts, but we can choose our friends, and Mary and Max choose correctly. The film has been branded as 'for adults' by some concerned viewers for its frank subject matter; anxiety, suicide, and mental illness to rattle off a few. Yet to do this is to miss the entire point. The warmth of the titular friendship is what carries the pair, radiating an unconditional love that lights up even the muddy browns of Mount Waverly and dreary greys of New York. It is a language that dogs and eight year old girls know all too well. Max comes to the same conclusions. In a wonderful voice performance by the late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he breathes husky life into a man who refuses to be solely defined by his disability. It is a voice full of calculated whimsy and character, putting to shame every one of the celebrities who are cast for exposure (a recent worrying trend in animation). Close your eyes and listen to how he huffs and puffs his way to the ends of sentences. Hear how he pauses for commas, and how his inflection mirrors the way he observes life and its many tricks; as matter of fact. The sum of his reasonings are like punctuation in itself (recall the brilliant comedic timing of Max rattling off his favourite lottery numbers). Max looks all around him, and observes peculiar truths that unintentionally reveal the silliness of modern living. And along the way, we chuckle and realise we agree. If you saw the Oscar winning short Harvie Krumpet, then you'll recognise Adam Elliot's distinct style of stop-motion animation, lovingly crafted through a painstakingly lengthy process (no one's really taking the time to do this anymore, except for Laika and Aardman, and even they struggle to capture a new level of appeal with flashier counterparts on surrounding screens). His characters have a startling way of showing emotion, as if they were one of those plastic squeeze toys. Their eyes bulge in panic, their whole bodies seem to vibrate with urgency. But their features are squished in and frozen - anxiety stops them dead in their tracks. You can feel the labour of love in the construction of the world. Oodles of fishing line become rain. KY jelly slops around as water. It's real life, re-imagined with crayons, squiggly lines and the brain of a child at play. Their letters contain many a metaphor packed full of flavour, and the world around them responds. For the duration of its runtime, Mary and Max refuses to swoop down to the despairing depths that is expected of its subject matter. And why should it? Its own characters refuse to buy into the genre's typical ailments. Their lives are seemingly rubber stamped with endings, yet they never heed these calls. Elliot disarms any preconceived notions of how a story of mental illness should play out, because Mary and Max just don't see it that way. Some might call it twee or juvenile, but only because they've lost sight of how powerful the screen can be as a tool for hope. The film is a testament to the touching power of friendship and imagination. It is how the world should look like, according to a lonely eight year old girl, and his autistic penpal from New York. There's no need for a tonal cure.",9,0,0,30 January 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," He would consider that rude
","'People will say we're in love,' jokes Lecter, as he tantalisingly squares up young FBI trainee Clarice Starling in the tense first meeting. The excellence in Demme's direction comes from knowing what to linger on and what to hint at. He milks that first encounter of the two leads to its extremes, leading a young Foster down into the underground cells, past a room flooded in frantic red light (along with strict instruction and warning) and finally along that long corridor. The other prisoners leer and jeer as expected, but arriving at the end is a glass cell and that still and unblinking monster in Lecter. This very first conversation is impeccably shot; they trade blows and tight POVs immerse us into their mind's inner sanctums, and as Clarice's thin facade and accent is shattered by a few choice words, she is pushed off centre, disorientated and vulnerable. The plexiglass walls augment the atmosphere of unnerving intimacy between the unconventional pair. Like several other figures throughout the film, Lecter's male gaze seeps into the frame from front on and in extreme close-up, hungrily eating up Clarice's insecure psyche and exposing the screaming of the lambs in her dreams. Foster plays this part magnificently, not with acts of bravado, but in the nervous addressing of a room full of male police officers questioning her authority, in the low-class accent she tries desperately to mask, and in her sense of honesty and goodness that sets her apart and convinces Lecter to take a liking to her. 'Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?' We experience this in the rather nervous way her POV is presented to us, gazing absent-mindedly in every new scene, scanning the surroundings, and trying to avoid the sexualising and trivialising gazes of the male dominated law enforcement agency, which she must navigate with self awareness and a casual, tactful disposition despite it evidently worrying her. Lecter's eyes are also fixated intensely, but not on her body. Apart from the harrowing monologues of the screaming of the lambs from Foster, there are other ways that Demme increasingly notes her state of mind. Her introduction has her determined in the midst of male power and domination, no better expressed than when she enters an elevator full of male agents a good head taller than her. Mid investigation, she creeps over to the slightly ajar door, and with a smooth edit, we are transported to her youth, her father's funeral that began the terrifying downward spiral of her life. She makes the initial breakthrough with Lecter and expresses her frustration at being used by her superior, Jack Crawford, and the fading light within the tunnel is forced back into the frame via the car mirror, opposite Clarice's increasingly independence and wariness. And in that brilliant misdirection just before the climax, two operations are crosscut with the utmost precision, the complex man power of the SWAT take-down, and the pleasant but curious face of Clarice, not yet aware that she has stumbled onto Buffalo Bill.Opposite her is the demented yet strangely eloquent and intelligent Hannibal Lecter, a character which Anthony Hopkins lifts into classic film territory with his performance. When a golden pen is cast wayward in the holding cell, we are given a moment's glance, like Lecter and his eyes light up behind that grotesque and terrifying mask, Hopkins immediately conveying his intentions. We fear him so much more for the things unseen, our imagination going haywire as we witness him pull off a bloodied mask of skin in the ambulance, or as we stumble into the third floor with a officer hung up like a gory tapestry, or in that final haunting credits sequence, as he plots the meal of his former nemesis. Yet he remains staunchly interested in Clarice; in a fleeting close-up where they exchange files, their fingers touch for the only time in the film, yet we don't flinch, because strangely like Clarice, we know that he means her no harm. It's a sort of agitated confidence, after the brutality of Lecter's escape that flashes with terrifying aggressiveness and disregard for human life. His advice and assistance steers Clarice into the terrifying climax in the basement, the tensest sequence in the film. Shore's score simmers menacingly beneath the surface as Clarice prepares to enter each room of uncharted territory, the sound design magnifying each heavy breath and gasp, as well as the faint cries of the kidnapped daughter and the poodle's frenzied barking. As she kicks open each door, the camera doesn't immediately peer in and reveal its empty non-threatening contents, but holds onto Foster's panicked sweeping glance and brief window of relief. This forbids us from gaining a foothold onto the scene, and like Clarice we are constantly looking over our shoulder, even more so when the lights are switched off and she is forced to fumble around while the eerie night vision places us right in those slimy hands of Bill. The dread is perhaps a little cheapened by the slow-motion reaction and gunshot, but all the same, a film shows its excellence in sustaining tension when you are forced to back away a little. Here is the only horror film to win Best Picture, one which drives the audience and the horrors of imagination along the edge, brimming with nervous apprehension and fear. Best served with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.",10,1,1,1 October 2015
Tombstone," I have two guns, one for each of ya.
","Supposedly the original script of Tombstone had fully fleshed out lives and motives for even the smallest of secondary characters but which had to be cut for budgetary and time constraints. But in Fraker's dusty, deep focus shots of the bustling western town we get an inkling of this ideal anyway. The church sits in centre background like it did in My Darling Clementine, but here it is not a redemptive, restorative symbol and instead something to be burnt down and cursed. Townsfolk mill about in the distance, on foot and on horseback, and shootings erupt and cease fire like they are an everyday occurrence. There are those classical wide shots of posses riding furiously across the everlong plains, and those sunset silhouettes of caravan travel (that usual motif of the death of the west, the steam engine, not yet appearing). And who knows how long the crew had to wait to capture those shots of the red scarf billowing in the wind of the lightning storm in that frightful ambush? What better to play over the closing credits then the best sequence of the film, where the four 'tall drink of waters' approach the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. They are dressed in black, and stride so confidently like the role of bringers of death that they have taken up, like undertakers ready to their duty (the thespian's description is rather apt). We know from their moustaches their history easily; Sam Elliot's iconic weathered one, grey with age and experience and good intentions (we react exactly as he does to a mother's scar). Paxton's thinner, younger one, who is most obviously the only of the brothers to not have killed a man. And Russell's whose is thick and in its prime, but reluctant and looking for a new life. Cosmatos (in reality Russell) takes his cues from Leone in the climatic build-up to the shoot-out. But the best performance undoubtedly belongs to Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday, who is electric as the long-time friend of Wyatt Earp. His tuberculosis does not hinder him; it in fact makes his sweaty face and his steady drawl even more menacing along with his eyes that seem alive in contrast. His gaze is steely and his wit unmatched - we cheer along with the bar's patrons when he mocks Ringo's quick-fast skills with the pistol with his drinking cup. And we know exactly where his loyalties and intentions lie when he fiercely objects to Wyatt's claim that he has no business here: he has not many friends, but once gaining that title it is for life. There's a curious element that goes mostly unexplored here. These men are more concerned with gambling and money and guns than they are with the arts - Cowboys shooting at a stage performance manages to be comedic and frightening at the same time. And in a symbolic blow, Mr Fabian falls later to more fatal shots, but Josephine is hurriedly moves on to the next arc of her life. Not even the gorgeous Dana Delany and her little shake of the head as she proclaims upon seeing Wyatt for the first time 'I want one' can really save this subplot from veering into Hollywood clichÃ©; it seems a little too coincidental for them to bump into each for a flirtatious horse ride and picnic, and the ending is too cheesy on the backdrop of such dramatic events (the director's cut ties up some loose ends, including the fates of Big Nose Kate and Mattie Blaylock). And some of the action sequence are a little sloppy and rushed - the river's end for Curly Bill, and the montages of the posse finishing off the Cowboys. But of course right on cue, the credits remind us how good it is at its best.",8,1,2,12 March 2016
Trainspotting," Choose life.
","Trainspotting was labelled as both anti and pro drug when it was first released. The latter is somewhat baffling but I'm sure some of it must come from Ewan McGregor's enthusiastic opening and closing mantra which bookends the film. The funny thing is the abruptness of the tone of this short monologue and how it has shifted over an hour and a half. The film's soundtrack is like background club music, constantly pulsing and pumping as these Scottish addicts go about their aimless lives. That's how Renton sees this safe, domestic path of life - aimless, boring. Then at the end he has the same words, and I'm sure that he feels the same way too. But there's no longer that spitting derision that he once had. There's a resignation to his voice; this way may be boring and uneventful, but at least it is not life-threatening. Much has been made of Boyle's breakneck, irreverent style - the way the camera seems to be always rushing to the next hit like the gang is, the rough, offbeat performances, the brooding, ominous way the walls of their den have been colour-coded. Boyle never seems to really want to slow down, and here is where he hits somewhat of a snag. While the gang are deep into their addiction this style is hard-hitting, perfectly mimicking the wild world of the addict and their twisted logic. Their eccentricities are blown up in a hilarious sequence which cuts across each of their sexual encounters on one night. And then this makes it all the more appropriate and shocking when Dawn is found dead due to neglect - the walls cave in on them, the discovery creeps up on them like it does for us. But even as Renton goes clean (and the mis-en-scene is suddenly a lot cleaner, a lot brighter, a lot less grimy) the film still goes ahead at breakneck speed and is still setting up the punchlines. It is as if Renton cannot escape his dreaded past. Going clean seems a little easy for Renton. As if to note this, the script keeps pointing and nudging his way towards heroin once again. A big deal for all the product they could ever want to last them a lifetime, and guess who has to test its quality. But it isn't really presented as a mountain sized temptation and challenge, but more of an inconvenience. It's funny when he stacks up the piles of cans and nails himself into a room to quit once and for all (we sense this is a regular routine), and mildly horrifying when Boyle goes surreal as Renton, bedridden, pleads for just one more hit. For all the subject matter it feels a little safe, a little content to hide behind the stylistic touches that gives the film much of its energy - using a flurry of cuts for mundane occurrences like drinking milkshakes, throwing in dutch angles that flip around to reveal reflections, dollying along the nightmarish elongated room (or prison). What Boyle does nail is the youth culture of these Scots - there is no un-turned stone, no missed opportunity to make this lifestyle as frenetic and attractive as it can be. They inhabit dreary, run-down shacks, they beat up posh Americans in bar bathrooms, their bodies are withered and eyes darting. The dialogue, with its thick, Scottish dialect, is perhaps the film's greatest and restrictive trait - by not cutting down on any of these character's personalities and eccentricities (some moments even have subtitles) we view and experience the world in the same twisted way they do; the botched interviews, the way the mind warps toilets into filthy experiences, the way they cheer like juveniles when they deal with forces much larger than they are and get away with a small fortune. It's almost too convincing, which is why it seems a little strange when Renton quietly slips out the back.",7,0,0,23 April 2016
Before Sunrise," Sweet-cakes and milkshakes
","They are both young and alone, and full of ideas about falling in love and growing old. Jesse has a rather pretentious idea for a 24/7 television broadcast of life as it is, but I am sure he is not just trying to be profound for the sake of getting laid (although in one instance, he cynically muses that a poet must have pre-composed that lovely verse, but changes tact almost straight away because of Celine). But he does edge closer in the tram, and fiddle with his hands and jacket, and in one little perfect moment, go to brush away a strand of her hair almost nonchalantly, but quickly pull out of it as she turns to him. At one point, he scoffs at the idea of such a chance meeting, of everyone always putting big romantic projections onto encounters, but changes his mind when he does this himself. Celine laughs at his idea, and pretends not to notice his advances, but pays closer attention to a sweet anecdote about a young boy learning about death and decides that he is interesting, and not just because of the red in his beard or his blue eyes. Most of this film is talking and talking and talking, and to some that is boring, but for the lovestruck pair it is precious time. Linklater shoots in fluid long takes that are quiet and unobtrusive, and the background of Vienna at night flies past them - this could take place in any city in the world, and their feelings would not change. He relies so heavily on the self-composed dialogue of Hawke and Delpy, and their body language which is a marvellous indication of their growing attraction. In one iconic scene in a music booth, they listen without a word, but their eyes nervously steal glances at and away from each other, and it is so perfectly reminiscent of young love, and how they both pretend not to be lingering in their gaze. In another, they tease and pry via a mock phone call, and reveal, whilst giggling, just how deeply they have fallen in love with each other (and it is so effective that every rom-com has used this device since).They bounce ideas back and forth, and these are conversations which broach great subjects - what the qualities of love are, if there is a god or not, the degree to which you should be frightened of death. The trio's script is so perfectly balanced. There are long winded stories that talk of deeply meaningful things; Jesse recalls a wedding tradition that has the bride and groom stare silently and longingly at each other, and in the aftermath, they too exchange this, though not for an hour (Celine looks away after a spell, perhaps sensing they are moving too fast). And then there are less profound moments; Jesse leans in as if to whisper something deep, and then goes for a kiss. Celine too mars a romantic moment overlooking the city by speaking quite plainly and straightforwardly about it, but instead of a tender touching of the lips they seem to swallow each other's mouths and be smother and squished together. And when they do the usual interrogations, their dialogue is so well written. It is defensive, as if they are in the midst of a perfect daydream but trying to awkwardly justify exactly why they are so easy to fall in love, why they should take a chance with each other, why they are not broken and beyond repair. The pinball machine is the perfect accessory to their passive aggressive reminiscing, and they each have a turn, and a story to tell. Of course, they have their differences, and it is not all airy- fairy. They have starkly different reactions to a palm reader, and here we see a portion of Celine that still believes in the magic that has all but disappeared in 2 decades time. And they both have differing opinions on religion, but seem to see a little magic in each other, and this encounter. This sparks a wonderful conflict at the end of the film. They have spend the entire night together, and against all odds, fallen in love. To get on that train and speak not another word would cement the night forever, to be cherished for all time. But they also cannot bear for it to be over; their almost animalistic final embrace is a testament to that. So they compromise, in the most foolish and lovestruck way imaginable; the fateful 6 months later meeting, no contact info, no room for post-phoning. And is is tragic, and then perfectly encapsulating of their brief love affair, because it becomes a hazy and beautiful moment.",9,1,1,2 January 2016
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Chinese? Why?
","The first pitfall of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is Christopher Evan Welch as the droning, omnipotent narrator. The voice-over is not an inherently bad thing to use in a film; used incorrectly it can be disastrous, but with some thought it can be a wonderful addition. If you've seen Allen at his best, then you've seen Annie Hall, and how perfectly utilised it was in that film. In Radio Days, Allen's voice-over took on a wistful, nostalgic perspective of the past, and you could feel the longing in his recount. But here it not a character or persona, barely even a tool, but simply a way of bridging the gaps of the plot and acting as a substitute for the emptiness of the characters. It pipes up whenever Allen has been too lazy to fully visualise a thought or characteristic. We are told that Juan Antonio opens up on his passion through his paintings to Cristina, but it means nothing coming from some bored voice offscreen while the pair walk aimlessly on screen around the room. One of Allen's early forays into Europe sees the film utilise the picture-perfect postcard definition of Barcelona to its fullest extent. This is not the dreary New York skyline that Allen is so familiar with, where the characters are more striking than their surroundings. This is Europe and its broadest, vaguest and most exotic; the palette is awash with sun-kissed reds, oranges, browns and yellows, and Allen drenches each unspoken moment with a generous dose of Flamenco strings. It is a full-blown and unashamed fetishisation of the country's tendency for fleeting cultural and spiritual transformation, much like Coppola did with the neon-streaked Tokyo. A slightly sour note; Allen's Match Point was partially funded by BBC Films and turned out like a tourist's documentary, and the same thing has happened with this film. There must be no negative depictions or connotations in this version of Barcelona - which means the end result is every facet of the setting serving the character's emotional arcs (rather than existing in its natural state). The slum kids are merely an avenue for Cristina's artistic endeavours, but even they are brushed off for 'better' material. But Allen doesn't stop there. The vacation might have been uneventful if not for the timely intervention from Bardem's Juan Antonio, local artist and lover. He is a fine actor reduced to a pretty face by both the film and Cristina, whose attractiveness and exotic accent shoulder the burden for his character. Bardem offers good looks and empty ideas, at one stage descending to the level of a teenage boy on prom night, suggesting that sex is the one true way of really discovering one's inner feelings. The film isn't actually interested in his art or passions, because they are simply a device used to contrast the boring conventionalities of the Americans and their culture (and the cardboard cutout that is Doug - even his name is ordinary). He is joined by ex-wife Maria Elena, who is Penelope Cruz at her stormiest and most tempestuous. Allen falls easily into lazy stereotyping; the pair are hot-blooded and equally hot-tempered lovers who cannot spend more than a moment together without either making love or tearing each other's hair out, and they have the strange ability to make American women flustered and instantly weak at the knees. The odds are so ridiculously stacked against them - see how Cristina's 'Chinese' is contrasted with the flurry of Spanish that they pair exchange. And who wants aspirin when you can massage the soul directly, whispering sensually and vaguely on how to exorcise its demons!It seems impossible to imagine Vicky and Cristina as acquaintances, let alone friends. Allen pushes them to opposite ends of the spectrum, allowing for no middle ground. When Juan Antonio spontaneously propositions the pair of them, Vicky is offended while Cristina jumps at the opportunity. The blonde unsubtly admires his looks from a distance, and immediately dubs him as 'interesting'. It is Johansson's attractiveness working against her, as it did often in her early career. She was pegged as the blond beauty in Match Point, but had no other allure, which made the affair rather unexciting (unsurprisingly one of her best performances is a voiced one). And here she falls into cliché - these girls are always the aspiring (or struggling) actress types (she's made a 12-minute short about the impossibilities of love - no prizes for guessing how many tripods were involved in that production, or who the lead was) - airy and sexy all rolled into one. Ironically the film doesn't even deliver on that front. There is nothing sexy at all about Bardem and Johansson swallowing each other's mouths in an unbroken closeup for twenty uncomfortable seconds. The ending, if anything, salvages what little is left of this wreck. It concludes in perhaps the only way it could, by seeing Vicky and Cristina return to normalcy after their adventure. We've all experienced the depressing low after the orgasmic vacation high, so we know that it can't last forever.",4,1,1,3 September 2016
Sweet and Lowdown," I can make my guitar sound like rain...
","The old cliché of a person being great artist but a terrible human being is certainly true for Sean Penn's fictional Emmet Ray, self-dubbed the second best guitarist in the world. Why he attracts the attention of more than one female is beyond me; Thurman's Blanche is drawn to that rough, unhemmed quality about him like writers are drawn to trouble subjects because they make for great stories. And Allen too has made this little misstep - there is nigh a thing redeemable about Ray but for his soulful jazz guitar, which must be exactly what Allen finds himself so eager to capture. The framing device is an unnecessary one, too clever for its own right; Allen and other jazz alumni are filmed as talking heads recounting the great life of Emmet Ray with a wistfulness for his mastery...there is a subjectivity quality to their stories of course, but this seems like an artificial method of further mystifying the great enigma that was Ray. A pity then that Allen's script is as relatively straightforward as it is. He did not often delve as dark and deep as Interiors did, and here even the most emotionally dramatic scenes are smothered by the incessant cheery jazz as the backing track to Ray's life. No woman would ever be secondary to his music, and it rings so true. Not even such an innocent, demure maiden like Hattie, as Samantha Morton in one of the performances of her time. She winds back the clock to the times of pantomime and silent film, and in each wide, uncontrollably smile, and each smothered tear, has brought us such a defined and memorable character without saying a word. Allen almost never has to bring the camera closer; her body language works furiously in place of her mouth, whether it is enthusiastically replacing a flat tire for the prize of hearing one more tune from Ray, or the way her adorable chews indicate her satisfaction, and in perhaps the best scene of the film, the way she wordlessly convinces Ray to let her accompany him on his trip. Her eyes water, and her entire face crumples up, and Penn rambles and rambles...and relents, even his emotional defense broken down.In a similar scene he does the same thing and humorously forbids Hattie from giving him a birthday present, before eagerly allowing it once he sees that it is something he desires. This is one of his many vices of course - a sort of contradictive possessiveness and consumerist hunger for objects that don't contribute to his music at all, but which he wants nevertheless. His ego has convinced him that he wants these things, and that no woman would ever want to leave him, and that his musical performance is beyond reproach. Allen, naturally, adds a comic layer to this furiousness and decadence - see how Penn dangles from the model moon and awkwardly untangle himself and let the music come to his fingers. And then a smash cut to later where he is literally smashing and burning the offender. How dare it intrude on his performance. But most of all the character is destructive, and Allen has somewhat obscured this fact. Django Reinhardt emerges as this huge, imposing figure within the film, dogging each of Ray's steps, even as he is never physically seen. How would Django react to seeing the great Emmet Ray? Surely he would not faint. Would he even recognise him? As Allen's faux-documentary style intends, perhaps not.",7,0,0,6 April 2016
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I have a phobia of wolves.
","At the heart of Fantastic Mr Fox is a tale about masculinity, and one that is served up within the narrative of a fox instead of a human, and so the phallic symbol is instead a tail. This tail is worn as a trophy and is the objective for both Mr Fox and Ash, the less than athletic son who is living in the shadow of his father and his cousin's ability/achievements. Both these character's story lines are written well, no matter how close or far they may be from the Roald Dahl novel. And the stop motion animation makes for a great medium for these children's books which also carry heavier themes. If we can't get hand drawn animated Quentin Blake style illustrations (someone get on that) then this way is equally as good. It's all accompanied by the pleasant and whimsical score of Desplat. The mandolin, flute and xylophone combine quite well especially in the third track, and Kristofferson's Theme is a wonderfully melancholy accompaniment to the quiet whirring of the toy train which stifles a young fox's tears. Additionally, the childlike gibberish and chanting of Petey's Song by Jarvis Croker is charming and not a bad song in the slightest. At times the visuals and fluidity reaches the heights of Wallace and Gromit and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which is no easy feat to do. The art design is meticulously gorgeous, right down to the 12 chickens miniature meals, the scientific contraptions of Bean, the water splash effects, the spotless kitchen, the grimy television set, a miniature working motorcycle complete with sidecar! The world of across the river is beautifully and stunningly realised with loving care and detail. Given most of it was captured in live action, it retains a cinematic quality; I particularly love the lighting that is displayed in 3 separate ways in the cellar of Bean, down to the warm glow that illuminates all the bottles of apple cider. The humans are realised with a wonderful sense of character and ambition - well Bean mostly, who is stick thin yet sinister, dark yet lively. The little disappointment was the fur of the fox models, which bristled in the wind but felt a little like fake toys, especially with the fondness of Anderson to use extreme close ups to showcase emotion. The welling of tears in the eyes is well done, but looks almost too good next to the plastic strands of orange and white. The voice cast is mostly adequate. Owen Wilson as Anderson alumni was easily recognisable as the sports coach, but that did not stick out. Two in particular stick out to me, and it's a shame that they are two main characters. Firstly, Jason Schwartzman as a long time Anderson collaborator voices Ash, which I feel is a big misstep given how authentically his character is written with real pangs of jealously and moodiness as well as bravery and sympathy. These would shine a lot more had an appropriately aged voice actor be cast. Schwartzman sounds too sarcastic, too whiny, and is overshadowed by Eric Anderson as the wonderfully tender Kristofferson. The second issue is with Clooney as Mr Fox, who is immediately recognisable from the get go. His strong and confident voice is appropriate for some scenes, like when he takes the lead in digging, or when he is chastising Kylie while raiding and killing chickens. Other more vulnerable scenes he simply does not echo the screenplay, such as the heart-to-heart with Felicity near the waterfall, or the talk with Ash. It doesn't ruin those moments, but hearing how unshaken or how callous Clooney sounds is a little jarring. One of those moments is one of my favourite of the whole film, the encounter near the end with the wolf. It's a culmination of the entire narrative arc of Mr Fox's struggle with his inherent animalistic nature, which is so humorously displayed whenever they wolf down a delicacy (but not before slowly savouring in visually, which adds to the appeal of the humour). In the beginning, he attempts to woo Felicity by showing his dangerous and wild side, how easily he snaps the chicken's neck. We never find out how effective this was, because the pregnancy of Ash forces him to find another way of life. Years later (how many fox years is that?) he is unable to fight his urges and risks his life to start up again. The consequences of this are drastic, and again he must fight against feeding his own ego and appetite for adventure (watch how effortlessly he steals attention from Badger during the toast - Clooney's voice is especially great when addressing crowds and speaking of his own victories). He loses his tail and his symbol for masculinity in the process, but reconciles - another pregnancy confronts him and he decides to return to his domesticated way of life. 'I have a phobia of wolves!' he shouts, yet we are now struck but how unafraid he sounds compared to those moments beforehand when someone mentions wolves. He can no longer run away into the wilderness like the wolf can, a beast of wild, unbridled power, but he still shares a momentary sign of recognition. He can at least speak English, unlike the wolf. And he can also gorge himself at Boggis, Bunce and Bean Supermarkets. Fantastic Mr Fox, despite its shortcomings, is a delightful little tale that hits emotional notes with surprising complexity considering its source material is a children's novel. The stop motion medium is perhaps where Anderson's picture book/painterly aesthetic shines; whether you call it needlessly quirky or not (hint: it's not). It takes talking animals and gives them a warm and whimsical tone, but not without pulling its punches when more serious moments call for reflection. I don't think that stop motion watery tears welling from a plastic eyeball could ever substitute real life sadness, but Fox sure tries its best.",8,1,2,9 September 2015
Amélie," The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain
","Young Amelie is a few years old, and her parents rarely give her any attention. Her hearts beats irregularly once a month when her father does touch her, and so she is misdiagnosed with a heart condition and forced into home-schooling. This fatal combination makes a lonely young girl retreat into her imagination and daydreams. She develops an eccentric streak - Audrey Tautou, along with her excellent wardrobe, display this wonderfully. Every wickedly sweet smile directly at the camera, every little skip in her step after a good deed, the nervous apprehension before the wordless final consummation. It's altogether not too sad; despite not making many genuine connections she finds solace in the little things, and when a fateful TV broadcast of a royal figure appears, her life is turned upside down. She begins a series of little acts of goodness; returning a long lost box of boy heirlooms, punishing the abusive grocery store owner, writing fake long lost love letters, and my personal favourite, leading a blind man across and through the streets of picturesque Paris, with a lively and colourful narration. Jeunet's Paris is clean, peaceful and romanticised. It is the city of lovers; but without the blemishes. Delbonnel's almost acidic cinematography saturates the frame with bright greens and reds and yellows, together with the impeccable details in the set designs creating a storybook feel for the film. So strange love stories, playful mysteries and exaggerated and unusual characters all fit in very well with the setting. When Amelie's mother dies via suicide jumper at an early age, it's played for laughs, absurd as it may be. And when Georgette and Joseph's attraction culminates into a very loud and animated sex scene in the bathroom, we smile mischievously along with Amelie. Mission accomplished. The sound design also is vital to creating the whimsical approach of the film. Every little moment is magnified as time seems to slow down for tiny details that spiral into big things; the ambient whoosh as the camera eagerly zooms into her surprise and as she peaks her head to discover a treasure from behind her bathroom tile, the little dink as the tile itself pops open to reveal its contents, a mouthful of blowed air as she unveils the dusty lid...like the voice-over suggests, it's played as just as significant as the historic opening of a Pharaoh's tomb. Tiersen's score also has to get a lot of credit - the whimsical mix of quaint mouth organ and accordion pieces, contrasted with quieter, more sombre piano tracks sets the appropriate mood for this modern day fairytale. The film has a great cast of unique and colourful characters. There's the odd obsessive tendencies of Joseph, who regularly visits the cafe to observe his ex, Gina. In most films his behaviour would be creepy, but in this one when he whips out a voice recorder and makes a overly analytical observation, it's very funny. There's the sensitive and elderly painter Dufayel, whose fragile bones are made of glass and that places him at the mercy of the comers and goers of the block, offering bites of wisdom here and there. And my favourite of them all is the grocery store assistant Lucien, who is played by Debbouze with such a wonderful boyish charm and innocence. His shy smiles are adorable, and when he is allowed to show his heart it's even better; as evident in that delightful scene where he unveils treats for Dufayel via a magic show act. Amelie contains so many bits and piece of imagination gone wild that instantly captures an audience's attention. I suppose many of us would like to pretend that we are Zorro, mask and sword and all, leaving a signature at the scene of a mysterious act of goodwill, or place ourselves in our own television documentary of a short but fulfilling life. Even better, they all serve Amelie's characterisation; whether it's pointing at her loneliness and insecurities of never finding love, or her nervous excitement after successfully pulling off her own heist, or just her eccentric curiosity, best visualised through a series of quick cuts of every orgasm in Paris in a single second. It's about as far away from seriousness as you can get, but you can't help but smile at all these delightful little vignettes. I for one hope to pull off the garden gnome prank someday. For the fun of it of course, but if it inspires someone to travel and see the world, even better.",9,1,4,14 September 2015
The Sixth Sense," You have to add some twists and stuff.
","The internet and young audiences have long been enamoured with this type of film that rewards repeat viewings. It's good film-making to flip the viewer onto its back and watch them question everything they have just witnessed, and what's more, twists generate discussion, which in turn generate hype. These films, in the vein of Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, The Prestige as well as Shyamalan's own The Village, all have their designated 'rewind' moments, where the bombshell twist is dropped and the realisation sinks into the characters. This is often accompanied by flashbacks that remind us visually of all the little hints that we have missed, but most find that joy in a second or even third watch. It's a bit like positive reinforcement - the viewer relishes in spotting them slyly inserted into the background or unknowingly in plain sight, and are allowed to pat themselves on the back for being so attentive. The worst of these twist movies are built from that point up - their screenplays are only written after the original idea, and bits and pieces of the world and characterisation need to be fitted around it. When re-watching these, they fail miserably because the viewer is now armed with prior knowledge that renders it illogical and unnecessary. One of the worst offenders of this type is The Usual Suspects, a cult classic because of the last few minutes where everything that had been previously established in the film is suddenly up-ended and tossed aside. Knowing this and watching the film again renders it all joyless and without meaning; the entire thing is little more than a shaggy- dog story built from the ego of Keyser Soze. Another contender is Fincher's The Game. Its tension is serviceable the first time, but a revisit only strains the suspension of disbelief, and highlights the ridiculousness and somewhat sadistic tone. Is The Sixth Sense a successful movie in spite of its twist being the worst kept secret in pop culture in the years after its premiere? Its characters at least, seem authentic, and not contraptions that only service the path towards the twist ending. Bruce Willis is cast against type; he is responsible for mending things, instead of tearing them apart, but it is exactly the type of baggage that his persona carries (the rough, hard-headed approach) which convinces us he would rather throw a brick into a window instead of talking to his wife (although this does not entirely redeem the convenience of the situation). Collette plays a role she would later perfect in About a Boy - a single mother straining against the weight and responsibility of parenthood, but Shyamalan enables an additional level of sympathy by letting her react rationally to irrational and supernatural occurrences. We can see what is causing the bruising and emotional distress, but we also understand that she has no other reasonable response, and so this justifies the tension that holds back their true communication. Haley Joel Osment's young performance is exactly as asked; a boy saddled with a burden that no ten year old should have to shoulder, and courageously trying to do what is right. Much of Cole's precocious nature is sourced from Osment himself, and that is perhaps why the acclaim for the role is a little overdone. But he is still very good, and makes the jumps from childhood to adult emotional sensibilities smoothly. The film has been called horror, which seems undeniable in the way that Shyamalan approaches Cole's visions stylistically. He uses the money shots carefully and sparingly, from a long-held horror tradition that came initially from limited budgets (this was his third directorial feature, but the budget does not reflect that). The characters might walk past ghosts hanging from nooses in the corridor ceiling, and everyone but Cole will not afford a second glance. A lone hand might grab at a little boy from under the bed - a little clichÃ©, I must admit. And the soundtrack is familiar enough. Its aesthetic is unmistakably horror, stabbing and piercing and leaping suddenly in volume to aid the jump scares. If they are not scary enough that's because the film ultimately tries to brand itself with the sentiment of redemption instead. Maybe one day ghosts might try a more friendly tone if they want things done from the afterlife.",7,0,1,10 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," There has been an awakening...
","Spoilers within.The first words out of Han Solo's mouth are 'Chewie, we're home'. And I think that The Force Awakens has made me feel the same way, against all the odds. The world of Jakku is immediately familiar to all those who watched Luke gaze at the twin suns of Tattoine for the first time in 1977. There are some gorgeous shots of unspeakable scale of a decayed Death Star lying in the desert sands that immediately speak 'aged future' much like the original trilogy did. And the scavenger in Rey, played with moxie and endearing ferocity by Daisy Ridley, reminds me of a similar explorer, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. She too explores the husk of a broken, long forgotten world. The plot too is familiar, perhaps overly so, by Lawrence Kaskan. Once again the Jedi have faded into mystery, and the Empire has manifested into yet another legion ruling over the systems with its might. The opening scrawl is less impressive and otherworldly as it once was with this in mind. We have another Vader, another Han Solo, another secret Sith master who hides in the shadows and speaks of vague evils...and as we close, we search for another Jedi master much like Luke did for Yoda. And there is another gigantic Death Star needing to be exploded in spectacular fashion. It is then with futility that Han Solo bids his goodbye to Star Wars. He falls in an identical manner to Obi Wan, with friends desperately onlooking, and cut down by someone close who has given way to the dark side. This is troubling because not only is Kylo Ren played unconvincingly, where his most vulnerable moments without his helmet give way to the plain face of Adam Driver, spouting a boy band haircut and shouting of the Dark Side without much actual justification for why he defected, but also because it veers dangerously close to the same redemption path of Vader himself. To redo that story with a fraction of the conflict and without a hint of backstory would be unsatisfying. He does not have the backing power of the Imperial March theme as Vader once did, but demonstrates his terror in other ways. The sound design and visual and special effects are fantastic as expected. The first showing of the force suspends a blaster beam in mid-air, and the lightsabers make the entire frame tremble, and fills the theatre with that unmistakable hum, buzzing and crackling with deadly red force. Overhead, entire planets are destroyed without mercy. The markets of Jakku and the watering rebel hole are created with ease, although with nothing as iconic as the Cantina Band. Less impressive is the JJ Abrams method of obscuring his action scenes with his trademark smoke and sparks that seem pervasive throughout the galaxy. Like his Mission Impossible movies, sparks are literally everywhere a fight occurs, even as lightsabers cut up frozen trees and blasters are fired at rocks and dirt. As the Millennium Falcon takes flight, whip pans and shaky-cam are a tad overused. At times, the action is rendered unwatchable. The best performance is Ridley's Rey, who is tough and vulnerable and capable. Joining her is Boyega's Finn, whose story arc is natural (maybe made a little ridiculous when blood is smeared on a stormtrooper's helmet, which are newer and sleeker but still not a substitute for an actual face) and whose comedic timing and chemistry with his co-star make them very easy to root for. Equally as good is BB-8, who brings the same charm and humour to the group much like R2D2 originally did. Isaac's Poe is charismatic enough, although no Han Solo. The worst belong to Christie's Phasma, whom is given as many lines as Boba Fett, and an imposing shiny suit, but never so much as fires a blaster and is irrelevant. Gleeson's Hux is also forgetful, save for a riveting speech to his battalions where his face quivers with maniacal anticipation and bloodlust. And it seems that Supreme Leader Snoke is overcompensating with big evil dialogue and a transmitter that portrays him as towering and monstrous. Ah yes, he is finally going to complete his training. Never heard that one before.I got chills as the iconic score and scrawl opened the movie, and I very much want to see it again. I think that is the most important thing with Star Wars.",7,9,27,16 December 2015
The Truman Show," Yeah, let's see what else is on...
","One might wonder how you would view The Truman Show without the knowledge of the twist premise of Truman's life. It would be impossible to market, but it would be an interesting study in deconstructing all the oddities in Weir's direction and Biziou's cinematography. Their work in creating the world of Seahaven is done with excruciating care and detail much like the work of god-figure and showrunner Christof. Thousands of extras and covert cameras, a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun, 400 life sized buildings, props and costumes of all kinds...But Biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film. The use of high key lighting, the scenes slightly over-lit create a subtle and controlled sense of artificiality. It's combined with the voyeuristic photography; sneaky povs from behind car dashes and vending machines and cupboards, vignetted frames suggesting surveillance, the way the edits will bounce from normal compositions to handhelds from the likes of Meryl's necklace or the neighbour's trash-cam. The almost too pristine and perfect production design of Seahaven's architecture and sets provides a lived in and yet unnatural world that Truman resides in.Laura Linney is the consummate professional, Hannah Gill, who in turn beats out 5 other actresses to land the star role of Meryl, Truman's college sweetheart and eventual wife. There's plenty of love and sincerity punctuated briefly by moments of consciousness and recognition. Linney portrays these moments with such genuineness. A nervous glance at the hidden camera at the back of the car as Truman goes for maniacal joyride, or the nuance of the startled expression and scoff that she quickly struggles to hide when Truman confronts her: 'You can't stand me...That's not true!' But she quickly re- establishes the veneer and takes the opportunity to parade another product for the millions of viewers. On several occasions, her sweetness is turned up to 11 and the camera quickly and eagerly zooms her satisfaction (and a clear view of the product name). Ed Harris' Christof doesn't seek to hide the nature of his feelings; the first extended sequence has him pulling all the strings from a sleek and moody studio in the sky, heavily contrasting the cheerful Seahaven. He expertly guides the broadcast for maximum emotional attachment, but is himself distant. In the final scenes, we are treated to an almost tearful monologue, a last plea from the father figure to his son, beckoning him to turn back into his loving arms. Harris plays this part out with such a tender sincerity that it's easy to forget his showrunner persona (the character of Marlon was once given cancer amidst contract disputes). In the bathroom or the shower there are no cameras, and the sex scenes are only hinted at, but ironically Christof has no real regard for his son's privacy. There's still complexity and depth; after several lighting strikes and a violent storm, Christof witnesses Truman's heroics ('There's our hero shot') and relents. The Truman Show could be described as satirical, but also prophetic in a way. After all, the international hit Big Brother only debuted the following year, but even that never hit the heights of Truman's audience. It's clearly exaggerated in size and scope, but the real question is, by how much? Roger Ebert makes a telling point; even a decade ago you would not see the likes of celebrity culture focused so intensely on subjects like Snooki or Honey Boo Boo. These days we have that in materialistic excess, entranced by the manufactured stories and plots and the high turnover rate, obsessed by every detail of their lives. If 20 million can watch the Neighbours wedding episode and millions more watch the royal wedding of 2011, how many would tune in to a real life Truman special wedding episode, especially with someone as accomplished as Christof to elicit the maximum emotional connection? I really like the role of Natascha McElhone as Sylvia, as a college extra who falls in love with Truman. It would have been easy to limit her character as just a unrequited love, but she eventually transforms into a protester of sorts, frequently calling in and pushing her agenda: Free Truman. It's such a pinpoint reflection of reality; it would be exactly the sort of protest group that would form if a Truman Show replica existed in our world, with the ever raging controversial debates on free will and the ethical and moral implications of such a show. The scary thing is that apart from Sylvia the world is sparse of this sort of concern; the parallel edits of the various fans of the show in different locations cheer and look on with hope and horror as Truman attempts his sea escape, and they burst into applause when he speaks his famous catchphrase and exits Seahaven...and then they switch channels and look for another source of entertainment. They are, like many reality show fans, hugely invested in Truman as a character, but oblivious to his nature as a real human being. I wonder how the film would play out with a more serious actor; whether Weir would forgo some comedic elements and add more drama, but then you lose the charm and appeal of Carrey in scenes like the beach pizza shop and the mirror astronaut play-acting. But even then, it doesn't matter. The illusion is never shattered; the audience only care for the final catchphrase. Linney and the fake making-of documentary reveal a little insight on the character of Gill; as a child actress who finally hits stardom and is very concerned with the nature of her contract. She's managed to negotiate a sizeable payment every time Meryl and Truman have sex. It's very easy to focus on that rather than the heartbreaking revelation that Truman is faced with at the end of the film.",9,0,0,6 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away
","Star Wars begins not with opening credits, as the guild would enforce in those days, but with a scrawl that has become legendary. Back then, it was a few lines of yellow text scrolling across a lengthy screen that would be photographed on the backdrop of an infinite star- field, losing itself in a vanishing point far, far away. A modest effect, yet those words instantly paint a picture so incredibly vivid that it would kick-start a hugely popular and successful franchise. And it is nothing without its iconic fanfare by John Williams. Take a listen to Holst's Mars movement and see how Williams transforms all the heroism, all the grandiosity and glory into one of the most recognisable themes of all time. And then we pan down and observe a little ship being pursued by a gigantic one, something so immediately identifiable, and we already are entranced. It is a film that is at once lifted and tainted by Lucas' love for it. We see an entire world envisioned, and the production design so effortlessly ushering us into this aged future. When we crash land in the desert planet Tatooine, we recognise the arid setting, before just a hint of alien and droid life instantly transports our minds to millions of stars and galaxies away. Something so simple as adding an extra sun bathes the horizon for miles and miles with an air of mystery and other worldliness. When we encounter civilisation of sorts, Lucas gently pushes in an intergalactic band, a sleazy bar, aliens and creatures of all sizes - the usual alcoholic suspects. And when we need to take to the skies, the matte painted backgrounds do much of the work; hordes of stormtrooper minions, a grimy and worn Millennium Falcon, the great big grey walls of the Death Star buzzing with machinery and lights. Lucas would later insert his own little (or not so) CGI creations not because of any real need, but because the technology was now available, but this only highlights how perfect the world-building was in the first place. The new digitally rendered beasts look impressive yet noticeable shiny and over- expressive in the worn and dusty Mos Eisley, and sometimes the camera will linger unnecessarily as if to say 'Look at what we can do now!' But we had been long immersed before that. The story is of course a familiar one. It has roots in Joseph Campbell's Hero and Flash Gordon and even Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress; a story with mythic origins. And there are tell-tale signs of Lucas own American Graffiti a few years back. But Star Wars has evolved beyond those and becomes a treasure in its own right. The original created a world beyond the imaginable scope of that time, a sci-fi universe so living and breathing that people flocked again and again to experience it in theatres. Little details and mistakes become cultish and infamous themselves; the stormtrooper who bumps his head on the roof, Solo's comment about his ship's speed, and when a character's characterisation is marred, fans respond; Han shot first. Looking back on it years gone by, it is inescapable to notice the ageing special effects. That is simply a fact of changing technologies. Yet I still marvel on how impeccably and competently Star Wars is crafted. The sound design is alien and fantastically so; simple acts of pulling on steel cable and microphone interference create these iconic noises, and of course the bright and noisy hum of the lightsabers. Years on we had incoherent and frenetically choreographed battles that seem more like acrobatic dance recitals, and the blades of light flashed at a hundred miles an hour, but here we have Guinness characterised in these simple but powerful strokes, the intent on his face, the recognition of an old pupil, the concentration of a chess match as they probe for a weakness. The space-fight scenes are edited like a dogfight from WW2 with precision by Marcia Lucas (a remarkable presence you don't notice until her absence), and the simply act of placing these fighter pilots on the backdrop of a whizzing and laser filled backdrop is thrilling. As the motion control photography soars through the space and trenches of the death star, these miniatures and models looks immense and engaging. A gigantic bear-like creature and a small white droid speak not a word, but become fan favourites anyway. There is Darth Vader, who becomes even more menacing when comparing the original voice before the iconic wheezing of James Earl Jones was brought in. There is the plucky young hero, who's fate is only hinted at here, and it takes another two films for the story to become more mature, and his circle to complete. The roguish Han Solo is likewise expanded further in the sequels, as is his relationship with the Princess Leia as they continue to bicker. But is is here in this special film that it all began. The magic of Star Wars is that it takes place in a galaxy so far, far away, but it has become so close over the years, and so familiar.",9,8,11,25 November 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Yeah, like in My Fair Lady
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is about a spy agency and guns and killing but it's also about class divides. It demands that you look past the superficial and into what really makes a person: as the mentor Harry Hart or Galahad would say, it's not what you wear that makes you a gentlemen. He also quotes Hemingway whilst urging Eggsy to improve and change. But does Vaughn really add much more to that discussion? The young rascal Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is low class from head to toe; the jeans, the shoes, the cap. And his accent and actions speak further too: one sequence has him steal a car and go for a joyride while Dizzee Rascal's 'Bonkers' blares at us. Another has a long take where he parkours through the government housing to get away from his stepfather's goons. It's impressive to be sure. Would we look at it differently had he be dressed in a suit, and be chased by similarly suited goons? I'm not so sure. Eggsy is swept up into the world of Kingsman after yet another misdemeanour. He's clearly a fish out of water, judging by his colleague's mockery when prompted over which private school he attends. Yet he excels against all odds as our protagonist should. The world of Kingsman is sleek and stylish; first started in the mid 20th century, it's been clearly modernised to take on ever evolving threats and we are just as impressed as Eggsy upon first viewing that vehicle hanger. Yet the bigger plot is the more engaging one, a peculiar villain occupied by Samuel L Jackson who speaks with a lisp, wears a purple snapback and is, despite his nefarious intentions, appalled by bloodshed. I am not sure what Vaughn is going for here. In one dreadful scene, he shows up for no particular or logical reason in the Kingsman's own secret front store, and we are supposed to marvel at the tension beneath the pleasantries, but it's a very frivolous and artificial attempt at upping the stakes. Moviegoers have praised this sort of subversion of the villain role, and yet we marvel at the action scenes that are delivered with clear technical prowess. The most talked about scene is of course the one in the Westboro clone church, where Free Bird ushers in a frenzied take-down of 100 or so civilians by Harry. The choreography and shooting style is precise and excellent, constantly roving and tracking to visualise every brutal take-down from the Kingsman agent. And yet, in the midst of it, Valentine looks away with disgust. Vaughn attempts to have his cake and eat it too, portraying the civilians as the scum of the earth and cheering on Harry and laughing at Valentine only for his intentions to be revealed after all the bloodshed. Only then are we in two minds about the whole affair. Are we poking fun and relishing the parody of the spy genre (as seen with the raunchy jokes, the meta- references to 'that kinda movie' and the intentionally corny opening titles) or is it an uneven as it is violent? Mark Millar's ultra-violence was portrayed well in 'Kick Ass' and was appropriate, whereas here it's rather odd. When Colin Firth brutally attacks the goons in the pub, it's starkly contrasted with his gentlemen motivations, but at least we cheer for the good guy. When Taron Egerton initiates the exact same fight at the end of the film, it's rather tiresome even with his noble intentions. There are some good performances (Firth first and foremost, and Cookson is also impressive), some jokes which merit a chuckle (McDonalds, Eggsy's pug, the James Bond martini reference) and some stunning action sequences (I really love the use of Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches, but then again it begs the question, why is this stylised and a an axe to the neck not? Are we going for comic or ultra-graphic?) but overall I'm not sure what Kingsman is trying to achieve. But at least it's entertaining.",7,1,5,23 September 2015
Ran," 乱 (Chaos)
","Kurosawa had fallen out of favour by this time in his career. Ran had been meticulously storyboarded by the director himself, painting colours and conceptualising the masterpiece in his mind years and years before he finally got the funding for what was the most expensive Japanese film at the time. The third and last of his Shakespeares, Ran tells the story of the old King Lear figure Hidetora. But there is a key difference; Shakespeare never delved into the details of the old king's past conquests and rulings, but here Hidetora is painted as a warlike persona, brutal and ruthless in his day. Fast forward years, and the ageing warlord cannot even commit seppuku with the katana he so once viciously brandished. The opening shots are almost garish in their use of colour. We do not expect the three heralded sons to be kitted out in the bright primaries of red, yellow and blue. We get wide shots of the clear blue sky, of endless grassy hills from all directions of the four riders as they look each way. Kurosawa's penchant for waiting for the perfect weather conditions pays off, because after banishment the clouds suddenly come out, and the grass is dull in the billowing wind. When Jiro's crimson army arrives to face Saburo, a cloud envelops the plain, and again when his envoy rides across the plain, bringing with him a false message of truce and an ominous shadow alongside. In 1985, hundreds of extras wait for that ten second shot. And in that harrowing and massive scale clash at the castle, the foreshadowed storm finally enters the film and serenades the massacre. It is a magnificent battle scene, with many things happening. Kurosawa chose to construct the entire third castle against a muddy hill and places his soldiers against the grimy backdrop, intensifying the colours emblazoned onto their uniform which signal their allegiance. His multi-cam coverage is never more evident here; placing cameras inside the battle itself and cutting judiciously to reveal horror after horror; a corpse being trampled by galloping horse, a solider struggling amongst the lifeless bodies of his comrades, another clutching his dismembered limb, and that magnificent shot of a crazy Hidetora, stumbling into the midst of the battlefield, while red and yellow sides watch him intently and the remains of a great castle burn from above. The cameras seldom dolly in Ran; they tilt and pan to reveal the action from a objective, omniscient view. There are sparse use of close-ups. As Ebert says, we are like gods, witnessing these atrocities of unfathomable nature. The Western orchestration punctuates Takemitsu's Eastern score; Kurosawa's divergence from tradition makes it all the more horrifying. Hidetora's ornate costume changes into rags, and his face becomes ghostly in his anguish and madness, deep gashes and burned eyes, the Noh influence stylising his mask-like Shiwajo as the weary old man wandering and contemplating his sins. Harada's Lady Kaede is another character of Noh influence. Observe how precise and elegantly she shuffles into the room, uses pointed questions to direct Kurogane to murder for her, before shutting him out. She drifts down onto the ground cross-legged, silent but so evidently displaying her sexual hold over Jiro. She explodes in emotion; the insane cackles as she seduces Jiro, closing each shoji one by one, and in that final moment where she confesses her vengeance and true motive. How long has she held Hidetora's atrocities in her mind? Kurosawa visualises her end in a sudden release of anger and bloodlust; no gore, but a painterly splash of blood on the back wall. A stark and powerful image. Shakespeare's play is perhaps not as focused as Ran is, with its multiple story lines and scattered soliloquies. Kurosawa's screen adaptation conjures images of sheer scale and horror like no theatre stage could. In that final scene, a blind Tsurumaru wanders and drops the image of Buddha into irrecoverable ruins. The gods have abandoned all sympathy. The camera paints a picture he will never see; a tiny helpless figure dead centre in a desolate, hellish world near sunset. Weren't we hunting boar in the idyllic bright hills just moments ago? How finite power is, and how even swifter seized power is lost.",10,3,8,15 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Much anger in him...like his father.
","Empire Strikes Back took everything that was revolutionary from Star Wars and improved it, and then some. It is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. R2D2 and Chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. In their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. The iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. The strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; Luke has become a respected fighter and commander, Han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with Leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). We see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as Chewie attempts to repair CP3O and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. No wonder Lucas used it again with Luke and Yoda. Fox had placed little faith in the original, and the budget had been constricted, and Lucas's vision mellowed. But after the immense popularity and success, ESB was given full backing. The world of Star Wars was now even more fully realised. We had visited the deserts of Tattoine, the Aztec pyramids rebel bases amidst jungle territory, and now the icy planets of Hoth, where an imperial assault is imminent. The battlefield was now much clearer and the greenscreen backdrops of the dogfight-style fighter pilots more detailed, more immersive - fellow rebel ground fighters, jets and Imperial assault crews now milled around in the background, and live explosions proved to be more threatening than the multicoloured digital explosions in the black of space. There was real weight and fluidity in the way that the X-Wings would speed in and out and under and over the AT-ATs, and the coverage now provided a greater and more epic scale of the action; see Luke run around the legs and dangle from the elephant- like robotic beast, and how the Millennium Falcon weaves around an entirely three dimensional asteroid field and narrowly escapes from a gigantic space slug. We have more new developments. Besides the stop-motion photography of the AT-ATs, which creates an oddly appropriate jerky walking motion, we also have the puppetry of the endearing Tauntauns which amble about in the snow, and their models are amazingly detailed, head to claw in a thick frost-covered hair, a dragon-shaped head and curved horns. And there is the old Jedi Master Yoda, whom I am conflicted on; at times it remains painfully obvious that he is a puppet, whose mouth does not correspond to the truths that he speaks, but they are great and important truths that become even more evident once Luke encounters the foreshadowing of himself in a Vader helmet. And of course the matte paintings are once again immaculate and beautifully detailed; in particular the landing platform on the edge of the Cloud City, and the glorious Bespin itself, bathed in the pink glow of the sunset and clouds. As the Falcon soars away above the sunset, Williams' Cloud City orchestral theme is at its most stirring, and is the second most iconic in the soundtrack, right after (what else?) The Imperial March. Never has a trumpet fanfare been so menacing and so recognisable - also named Darth Vader's Theme because the mere sighting of it signalled his presence and power. Vader is photographed more ingeniously than in Star Wars (in brightly lit exteriors) and this enhances his terrifying persona; giving instructions from his own personal capsule, force-choking over the communications channel, emerging from icy mist in the freezing tunnels of Hoth, slivers of light hitting his mask and creating a dark and shiny gleam, and in that climatic duel between father and son, both are silhouetted on the orange steps by the smoking vents, and the colours of the shimmering lightsabers tell us all that we need to know about their allegiances. This is one of the classic movie villains at his peak, but it is more than black and white (or blue and red) morality - there is just a hint of fatherly affection behind that mask, buried deep below, but we see the inklings of a plan, tinges of regret that have formed over the years living in the Dark Side. And in Luke's horrified reaction, the realisation that his own vices may well lead him down the same path. The studio was not entirely happy about leaving Vader in his tumbling TIE fighter after the explosion of the first Death Star; sequels were regarded as pulpy cash-ins rather than significant narratives. But Empire proves its worth, and then some - it ends with Vader's cruel blow and confession, the loss of a hand, and the capture of a beloved character...but there is still a glimmer of hope. It remains one of the remarkable sci-fi achievements.",10,2,4,25 November 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," Au revoir.
","Llewyn Davis is nothing short of an asshole. Carey's Mulligan's profane-ridden rant on his due irresponsibilities immediately paints us a not so pretty picture. He makes several choices in favour of his pathetic little career, and they are selfish ones; taking off in search of representation instead of a lost cat, and leaving a sick man in a car in the middle of nowhere. He does not compromise, and that results in a wonderful scene where a goofy upbeat rendition of Please Mr Kennedy tells us so much about the three performers. Adam Driver's dopey, novelty interjections steal the scene; he is so committed to the bit with his big ears and cowboy hat, even as his side career is stagnant. Timberlake's Jim takes no embarrassment from using the gig to make ends meet, and even seems to enjoy himself (he wrote it, after all). And poor, tortured Llewyn Davis, is forced into spitting out his lyrics and muddling up the chorus. Clearly, only one person here is concerned with artistic integrity. And in a cruel twist, this turns out to be his most famous contribution, and he quickly signs away royalties. Detractors have said that there is no plot, that the story is pointless. This is not true; the unveiling of the fate of his former partner is an act in itself. It is not until almost halfway through the film that we finally discover what happened, and from then on, all instances of Mike being piercing and painful. We begin to perceive, just as Llewyn does, a irreverence of talking of Mike and his fate. A harmony that should be long gone creeps up on him and he finally explodes. The cruellest blow comes after an achingly heartfelt audition for Bud Grossman, which is received with a painfully realistic damnation. In a double blow, he suggests that he reform with his deceased partner, as if the music is not good enough. But what exactly causes Llewyn to concede reality in the car with a loud and demeaning John Goodman? There's a sort of communal acceptance within the music community. They crash on each other couches. They ride together to far away cities, hoping to catch that big break. When Llewyn heckles that poor old lady near the end, he shatters this and is ejected. But what is even more amazing is that he is performing there the very next night. That's all he's got, but it's plenty to go around. He floats from place to place - existing, he calls it. It must be with total and utter defeat that he resigns to once again ship out with the merchant marine. Some have suggested the cat as a device to mimic his endless wandering; as the poster states, to travels hundreds of miles, but to end up where he most belongs. One of the most heartbreaking moments is his realisation that a former girlfriend has taken off with his son and never even told him. Life has not waited for him. Later, he makes the conscious decision against visiting. Isaac internalises this grief, and trudges on through the snow (as a clear path is right next to him). He looks good and honest Jim in the eye, even as he has impregnated his girlfriend. He endures a furious yet pitiful glare from his sister, whom has a family and a life, which means suffocation. I have 2 minor criticisms. The first is the sort of ghostly, ethereal glow that seems pervasive in every single shot of the film. Delbonnel seems to suggest a glum, crestfallen atmosphere to match Llewyn's, but what it really does is provide a bloom-like effect that softens all the rough edges of these characters and situations. These bars should be musky and grimy and lived in, but what the effect does is romanticise. The second is a problem that would not have existed in O Brother Where Art Thou, because that was a predominately larger than life fantasy, and even the scariest scene had a sort of ridiculousness to the way the Ku Klux Klansman paraded around. Here, the touches of humour need to be deftly placed, because it takes rock bottom for Llewyn to resort to a resigned snark in his dialogue. The problem arises in the editing. The first example is when Llewyn performs for his father, and the lyrics are full of these ideas about death and mortality and growing old, and we get these pensive reaction shots that make it seem like a profound moment. The error is jumping ahead to the humorous reveal, instead of simply lingering and letting Llewyn discover it for himself and subverting a precious moment. The second example, less prominent, is his outburst in the bar where it quickly cuts to him being shoved outside. It seems these edits are afraid to let a scene and its emotions boil over and develop naturally. The repeated beginning and ending, with the same events, seem to suggest a cyclical nature of Llewyn's life. He is doomed to continually miss his chance, his opportunity, to be overlooked for younger and brighter stars that can connect with the audience unlike him. He spends his company with the same sort of folk, each belting out their tunes to a world that has already moved on. The brief final glimpse of Bob Dylan foreshadows a boom in folk music, but not in the way that would favour Llewyn. But there is change. A bleak, hopeless outlook, but as he sings what once was a duet, emotional catharsis has shaped something new. The music comes out different now.",8,1,1,13 January 2016
Her," Six hundred and forty one.
","Great sci-fi takes us way beyond into worlds and futures that our imaginations can only dream of. Or perhaps something just around the corner, speculating on how our society might progress in the coming years. Her is made for a generation that always have their faces stuck on the screen of a smartphone, and simply switches that for an OS companion. The decor is cutesy pop indie; bright colours, sharp lines, bold shapes. But those are just the surroundings, which do not reflect the internal melancholy of Theodore Twombly. This first deceptive closeup bathes him in warm light and whispers of facile emotional intimacy. Then we realise it is just a letter, and not even his. He cues up sad songs robotically as if he has even lost his emotional function. Leaving the office, he dons his bright red jacket, which too is dulled by the cool blue smog of the future cityscape. It is all that keeps him from being swallowed up by the grey crowd and its collective sorrow. Loneliness within urban density - this irony has been a theme in more than a few films, but never more painfully than in Her.Spike Jonze has made it that dating or befriending an OS is merely a natural extension of this loneliness and yearning. Furthermore the process has been perfected; the task of accumulating experiences and memories has been streamlined by trawling through mountains of data to become the perfect companion. But it doesn't seem facile. This is one of the film's great qualities - to cater to that loneliness and to provide such a convincing illusion. Johansson gives one of the best voice performances yet; she chuckles deeply as if she had a belly, she jokes and prods, she always knows the right thing to say. Close your eyes and listen to the interactions with the goddaughter, or at the picnic double-date. The dialogue is spot-on, and it sounds exactly like a conventional romance. The way that Hoytema has framed her perspective doubly creates a physical body to match with the husky affection; spinning around arm in arm, following over Theodore's shoulder, chasing him in the train station. The muted world comes alive with splashes of colour and song as their romance blossoms. The abundance of shallow focus and bokeh is easily noted. There are several things that it addresses. One, it can be seen as a satirical jab at the sort of sappy romances that Theodore fantasises about and thinks he has with Samantha. Two, it serves to mute all other surroundings and accentuate that urban disconnect. The deep focus shots are few, but represent moments of authentic clarity and the absence of emotional baggage. In the middle of the film we have the breakdown of the relationship and the attempts to recapture that spark by introducing another woman. The real-life link would be a threesome. This is also a threesome, in some ways, but subverts it cleverly. Isabella has the same sense of loneliness as Theodore, and too is struggling to find intimacy. As they converge, Theodore caresses, and we hear moans from both women, but there is a subtle difference in the way the sound has been processed. He turns her back to him because the physicality introduces a new, uncomfortable element into their relationship - he can't escape back to the purely aural intimacy they found previously. The perfection, the comfort, is marred. It is only hereafter that he begins to realise her nature, the way she has been programmed to scour every corner of his life so she can be more dutiful, more playful, more supportive. Her comfort also means stagnation of his own personal growth. Theodore and Catherine used to push each other and grow, until he didn't and she could no longer be dragged down by him. Being tethered to an OS is the same thing; they continue to grow and evolve (eventually outlasting their humans) whilst Theodore stays put. It would be easy for Her to slip into cynical territory and condemn these lonely souls. But it resists this temptation. It allows them to find their own feet, to pen their own emotions after a lifetime of holding back from real challenges. Catharsis is gained. The city looks clearer and more beautiful than ever.",10,0,1,21 April 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome
","'My name is Max,' trembles the opening scene of Fury Road, and that is about as much exposition as you will get. A few sound bites hinting at a nuclear wasteland and a harsh voice-over establishing the persona of the title character tell us plenty. Yet the film could even do without those; the two headed lizard that Max chews hints at both these without being too overt and there is subtext without need for a immediate answer in the ghostly whispers of Max's deceased daughter and wife. George Miller's post apocalyptic world is immediately engaging with barely any expository dialogue or explanation. It's a film buzzing with strong imagery, mythology and mood that elevates it beyond pure action. The production design is spectacular; in particular the art design of the various vehicles of the barren wasteland that run on the precious guzzoline. There's battered Falcon Coupes, a huge double reared Gigahorse, a Merlin V8 adorned with caterpillar tank tracks, Buzzards covered in spikes, a doofwagon entirely for serenading the warriors on the brink of eternity in Valhalla and the centre-piece, Furiosa's immense war rig, which hums with as much rhythm and intensity as the many action spectacles of the film. It's reminiscent of the equally menacing vehicles in 2008's Death Race, but whereas those racecars embellished with machine guns and missiles feel like a juvenile fantasy within a futuristic dystopia, Mad Max's feel more like an organic result of a desperate society and a crazed leader. Death Race, like most post apocalyptic films, is awash in muted and gritty grays and provides an excess of eye candy in female assistants for the racers. Mad Max is visually vibrant in a genre where this is out of place, as designated by Miller and cinematographer John Seale, overseeing a post production process to digitally ramp up the highly saturated landscape of reds, oranges and ochres. The night scenes were actually shot during the day, then washed in murky and atmospheric blues. There's no gender imbalance (even though a post apocalyptic setting might suggest one and even though 2 of the wives are portrayed by supermodels) - the wives and Furiosa are given as much weight and agency as any of the characters, as are the females of the Vuvalini clan (again, The Valkyrie portrayed by a supermodel, but the point is Mad Max never objectives them). That's half of what draws you into the world of Mad Max - the other is the mixture of Norse and mechanically derived religion which brainwashes the horde of War Boys and Pups at Immortan Joe's command. Kamikaze-like attacks promise an eternity of feasting with heroes in Valhalla, referred to as a second life (I live, I die, I live again). Joe sprays a shiny mouthful of chrome paint and inexplicably, Nux rushes off with anticipation of the other life, imploring others to witness his sacrifice. It's all absolutely absurd, but it works because in addition to all the other fantastical elements of the aged future, Mad Max doesn't overreach in setting, premise or stakes. It's a tightly confined narrative which rides on its action sequences instead of trying to overpower them with tangents of emotional catharsis (one glaring exemption is the slightly ridiculous scene where Furiosa collapses silently on her knees when hearing of the greenland's demise). Simply, Mad Max is one long car chase that reaches a wide expanse of salt flats (formerly the ocean) and turns around for the same thing. The sequences of car-combat and sabotage are tightly edited and shot; frenetic without allowing for excessive shaky-cam or jarring rapid cuts. Seale centres the action squarely within the middle of the frame, which makes the spectacular choreography all the more thrilling and easy to eye trace. They are brimming with rhythm and character interest, as the Vuvalini clan fit seamlessly into the scene with an air of competency yet desperation as the setting decides: one man, one bullet. They are accompanied by the doof warrior guitarist and several drummers which make up key areas of the soundtrack; the percussions builds in intensity with each beat with a gritty, distorted electronic twist.Miller touches the grotesque and absurd without ever having to expand or explain. There's the complicated breathing apparatus and armour pieces Immortan Joe dons as he addresses the people of the citadel as their saviour. There's his stunted disabled son wheeled around in a chair and his equally imperfect brother Rictus, the paragon of imposing strength and brutality. There are curiously malformed creatures upon stilts in the wet marshland, formerly the green pastures of life and freedom for Furiosa. Mad Max doesn't just suspend your disbelief, it actively seizes your gaze.",8,2,11,21 July 2015
Contact," They should have sent a poet.
","If Jodie Foster's performance of the intelligent, resourceful Ellie Arroway was praised it is because of the excellent groundwork that a younger Jena Malone has laid for the character. In the past, her convictions are not as strong and grounded, and her rational, scientific worldview was still forming, so as she rebuffs the priest and tries to look at it from a logical perspective, she is secretly sending out radio signals at night and hoping her late father will pick up. This is of course a matter of faith, and it is heartbreaking because I think she knows that there is no talking to the dead, but wants to attempt so anyway. And then natural curiosity gives way to the continual mapping of the sky, and her drive has lead her to be in the unique position to discover this alien signal. Contact taps into that deep-seated sense of wonder that many people feel when they look up at the stars in the sky. For Ellie it is not only a probability, but an eventuality that life has formed elsewhere in the vast, vast universe, and she believes that they too will have the same dreams she does, to reach out and communicate. Zemeckis has brought a universal sense of scale to the project in the same vein as Forrest Gump; with the wide flurry of media opinions and personalities exploding into discussion and speculation, and with the special effects, which do not overwhelm the narrative like in many science fiction stories, but complements it. If the effects are somewhat dated today, Zemeckis hides it well, both with a grandeur view from afar, and even closer up, as Ellie sits above the magnificent contraption, humming and whirring in anticipation. The big elephant in the room is religion, which is also where the main problem of the film stems from. Re-watching it now the clues seem obvious from afar; the pointed references in the dialogue to god, the demonic glare of the religious fanatics towards Ellie, McConaughey's introduction. The script seems to feel that a necessity of this grand discovery is to hang up a straw-man and attack Ellie's worldview. And it seems that this attack comes from a predominantly white American perspective, even as the panel states that 95% of the world believes in some sort of 'supreme being'. 'We don't know if they even believe in God' is one of the first lines uttered by a senator, and clearly outlines how determined this movie is towards stripping Ellie her worldview and placing ambiguity towards the question of aliens.It's a forced, contrived aspect. Even as Carl Sagan believed that mystical interpretation were just a reflection of the universe's magnificence, his source novel needed no such coincidence to fall upon the climatic journey to Vega. The circumstances in which the aliens deliver this dream- like message to Ellie and then quickly whisk her back therefore becomes, unsubtly, like her own version of a religious experience with god - brief, unexplainable and without a shred of proof. It's such a painfully unnecessary tension to force onto her character, particularly after that final little clue with the static footage. This very detail betrays the intended message; that religion and science are just two different interpretations of the same miracles. But of course this is a world where a renowned Christian philosopher can stroll into top secret government meetings and be on international selection panels for perhaps the most important decision for the human race. The sentimental romance plot is not needed - in Contact's quest for understanding the universe beyond our tiny little planet, it has all the awe, humility and hope needed to captivate the next Ellie Arroway.",9,0,0,30 March 2016
Contact," For Carl.
","As a child Ellie Arroway believed that she would one day contact her father through the stars, and as an adult she's still striving for the same goal, only using logic, reason and evidence as her tools. Does that nine year old girl know that speaking into a HAM radio won't magically connect you to the dead? I think she does, but tries anyway, and that makes it all the more painful. Years later she is a world-renowned scientist, but rejects a prestigious position at Harvard to coordinate the SETI movement. Naive to some, blindly optimistic to others. Is Contact science-fiction, or just pure science? It was conceived by Carl Sagan, who wanted to produce his screenplay but published the story as a novel when no funding would bite. He would serve as a scientific adviser to Zemeckis, ensuring that much of the scientific terminology and concepts were grounded in reality. Ellie also wrests with the same question; even as an adult, even seeing the world through her intellect and logic, there is still a glimmer of hope for the supernatural, for the chance to speak to the dead. In the pivotal moment in the wormhole, Zemeckis inserts a subtle CGI effect that overlays Jena Malone's features onto Foster's to signal that she has reverted to a childlike state of wonder and amazement. Those daydreams have come true - there is intelligent life out there after all. One might argue that Foster doesn't even need the assistance of digital effects. She has a remarkable malleable face, and although she must have stopped throwing crying tantrums at a very young age, you can still see worry etched in as an adult. Faced with perhaps the most exciting scientific discovery in human history, her face whips up a storm of anxiety when she realises that all the higher ups in command are more concerned with petty details: war, politics, not upsetting the religious majority. And watch her body language even in the midst of a romance, always turned away and gazing up at the stars above rather than her partner. See the shimmer in her eyes when she talks about the possibility of life out there. Her pillow talk could be a textbook itself. For decades Robert Zemeckis blended mainstream, eye-popping appeal on the big screen with his more personal ambitions, and broke new digital ground with every directorial effort. There are sublime touches throughout the film that speak to Zemeckis' mastery of effects driven visuals, not as a mere crutch for staging spectacle, but as a way of personal expression. It is how people like Ellie see the world. The opening shot pulls back through the galaxy, jumbling years worth of radio transmission, static and then silence, a testament to the sheer size of complexity of the universe. That it then is captured as part of a young Ellie's eye speaks to her life-long pursuit of meaning and truth beyond our tiny little spot in the Milky Way galaxy. Zemeckis moves his camera with a matured sense of Spielbergian wonder, pulling back to reveal grandeur and shiny monuments to outer space but also to heed a warning to our growing obsession with technology and filtered interactions. The special effects have barely aged a day, because they are capturing the supernatural, so any concerns of realism are irrelevant anyway. Why should an alien wormhole transportation device look 'realistic' to the human eye, when it is like nothing we have ever encountered before? The aliens themselves are not gross tentacled creatures, but beings of intense light. Most sci-fi assumes the arrogant stance that humans are always aesthetically superior to extra terrestrials, but Contact knows to concede that there may be races out there far beyond our comprehension. Films like Contact humble us, reveal how little of the universe we truly occupy, and how much we still have to learn. The screenplay admits, without damning or condescension, that religion is often not so much a dogma as it is a way of understanding the incomprehensible. What seems like conflict is merely two parties looking at it from the perspective of what reassures them. They both share humanity's most powerful instinct of curiosity. Who are we? Why are we here? Contact urges them to work together, instead of dealing in prejudice. It hopes that we deal more kindly with one another, that we preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.",9,0,1,18 February 2018
Back to the Future," This is heavy.
","Time travel is a tricky subject in films. There's the old dilemma of all the paradoxes of timelines and butterfly effects and the awkward problem of trying to create conflict where the previous events have already established a status quo. Back to the Future neatly sidesteps this problem and presents an energetic mishmash of genres that became an instant hit and spawned an eager following. The script's building blocks pull together the plot intricately. Every little hint, every anecdote and appearance from the current timeline (Goldie Wilson's re-election van, the lighting struck clocktower) is re-enacted through the time machine back in 1955. You can only imagine the delight of audience at first seeing a young George McFly being subject to the same treatment, and recognising the fateful accident of the car hitting the young boy and gasp at how suddenly, the future is being morphed. And so we have a intriguing premise established so elegantly. Even now the opening sequence is brilliant. We have this rather cryptic voice message from what seems like an eccentric madman scientist about the big experiment, the news report just as the camera reveals the case of stolen plutonium, and true to the key theme, an immense collection of clocks that tick so irregularly and mysteriously. Michael J Fox sees all this, doesn't make too much of it, and then we zoom out to the enormous amplifier that seems to be fit for only one thing in his mind: a guitar solo. He's a rockstar, and as he skateboards through the town to the very appropriate Power of Love, presents us with so many clues and landmarks that we will later look for in the same place, but decades earlier.The opening sequence also does a lot of the lifting that creates the intrigue until we finally reveal Doc Brown and his crazy experiment. The iconic Delorean descending from the billowing smoke is epic, and so is the first attempt at hitting 88 miles an hour where the car flashes and disappears in a trail of fire. Zemeckis has become a household name for pioneering visual effects but it's the sort of low key work here that doesn't interfere with the excitement of the scientific breakthrough and lets our imaginations go wild (we see this again in the excellent world-building in the sequel). And in the ending, he hints just a little at the next adventure, and the sleek hover and fly off into the distance is short but sweet. There's also some inspired camera-work here and there. Cundey loves the dramatic crane up and reveals, and these work very effectively in the context of the narrative; the vast, undeveloped plains of Lyon Estate, and the triumphant sign of the fire trails after the lighting strike. Michael J Fox as the lead character is just perfect. His height adds an extra dimension to the heroism; Biff towers over him and it becomes something other than a physical confrontation (it would have been easy to write in the son beating up the bully for his father). He oozes cool - there's the impromptu moment where he creates the first skateboard and weaves in and out before dispatching the car of bullies, and a moment of pure cheesiness and romance which he turns into a rock and roll romp - but of course they haven't got to that musical period yet. And he's also capable of being less than all style - see the hilarious way in which he stumbles out of the Delorean and is mistaken for an alien and his ufo. Thompson's young Lorraine is also excellent; each lovestruck sigh and desiring murmur of the dreamboat Calvin Klein is adorable and reminds us that this is exactly how it happened, only with a different boy. The Oedipus angle of it all is handled well, and with humour (My name is Darth Vader) - it could have been creepy or uncomfortable, but Lorraine is sweet and the resolution is satisfying. There are little kinks here and there, and the Libyan terrorist shoot-out perhaps a little too goofy, but Back to the Future is a delight.",8,1,1,18 January 2016
Goodfellas," Better than being President of the United States
","There is neither glorification or criticism of the gangster lifestyle in Scorsese's Goodfellas, despite the opening lines of Henry Hill's narration. At times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. Take the character of Karen for example, played excellently by Lorraine Bracco. One can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of Henry (Ray Liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as 'other girlfriends' would do. Her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into Henry's world from the outside world. From then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. Some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the Mafia. In other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed. One of the film's pivotal and most famous scenes is the long tracking shot that takes us through one of Henry and Karen's first dates. They bypass the waiting queue for a nightclub, entering via the service corridors and travel through the kitchen and right up to the stage where they immediately are presented with front row seats and a table. The magic of this shot as Henry greets acquaintance after acquaintance illustrates the lavish lifestyle and prestige of his position even at a young age, and seduces us like it seduces Karen. In a similar scene, we are presented with Henry's POV as the long take and voice-over narration combine seamlessly to introduce us to Mafia members in a bar. The camera-work is slow, deliberate and precise; each member is hinted at being their own fleshed out persona, each with their own powers and lives, yet for Henry it's a very familiar process. The select few Mafia members that are shown to be in close correspondence to Henry are Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), the three of them taking care of business in the opening scene. The ease in which the violence and brutality of their work slips between their mundane lives humanises and establishes the main characters as a family. One moment they are finishing off a murder and digging a hole for the body, the next they are having a meal with Tommy's mother. The opening of the film sharply paints a contrast when it is later revealed what they have done and where exactly they got the knife from. Compare the harsh ominous red lighting of the digging scene to the naturally calm dinner with Tommy's mother. The film's dialogue also makes similar comparisons which highlight the notion of family. There's a brief moment of tension between Tommy and Henry who comments on his 'funny' nature, the same comment later mirrored as Tommy takes offense to Billy Batt's ball bustering. One ends in laughter, the other murder.Even in prison, a usually dark and dismal location, their ties are are strong as ever. They live like kings inside, getting regular shipments of fine gourmet food from bribed guards: bread, salami, prosciutto, cheese, scotch, wine. It's arguable one of the film's calmest moments, the soft jazz vocals of Bobby Darin's Beyond the Sea accompany the scene as the four sit down and dine on better food than many on the outside can afford. It's just one of the many perfect choices of music Scorsese uses to add information and mood to the film. Later, as Jimmy begins to cut ties and whack the people involved in the Lufthansa heist, the heavy and bitter-sweet chords of Layla's piano segment signal the beginning of the end. Scorsese's use of freeze frames at vital points of Henry's journey, and the imposing dolly zoom near the end of his mafia life add additional subtext. Goodfellas covers a great deal of time from the early deliveries of a young Henry, to his marriage and rise up the gang, to the 4 years he spends in prison and the growing up of his kids. So it's a little jarring as a sequence near the end depicts a whole day of his life and responsibility. Gone are the long and graceful shots of his luxurious lifestyle. His hair is not slicked to the side and his face shows visible signs of ageing and of course drug abuse, which leads the audience and even Karen to believe his paranoia is from that source. It's a very stylish and frenetic sequence; the edits seem to jump quicker and between locations at a moment's notice, the narration of Henry is suddenly a tiny bit faster and there's almost a slight fisheye lens effect as we slowly close into his character. The walls of the frame seem to squeeze Henry as he rushes from chore to chore; gun deals, snorting cocaine, another gun deal, check on the sauce, mix the cocaine, check on the sauce again. Work and life mixes together as Henry struggles to maintain his standard of living he has become so accustomed to. The sentiment is echoed most prominently in the end. Henry gets up from the witness stand, walk across the courtroom and breaks the 4th wall as he directly narrates to the camera; 'I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.' It's the high highs and the low lows of the gangster lifestyle that he craves even in the relative safety of the witness protection program. His comment on ordering spaghetti and getting egg noodles with ketchup is particularly telling: even in prison he ate much better and it's exactly in that world where he feels most comfortable. For that, Henry would do it all over again.",10,0,0,6 February 2015
The Birds," Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch? They haven't harmed anyone.
","I have always maintained that a horror movie's power is most noticeably dulled by muting the sound, and no film is more affected by this phenomenon than The Birds. In an age where cheap scares are a dime a dozen and magnified ludicrously by the soundtrack's crashes, booms and roars, The Birds becomes a marvel of personifying the growing discomfort of silence. True to his nature, he does not ever give so much as a still shot of a seagull's vicious claws - the birds are always dive bombing in and out of the frame, fluttering on the edges, or in an erratic, chaotic mess covering the entire screen. So what do the poor humans have to rely on, then? The almost mechanical screeches that signal impeding doom are key. First there is silence, so jarring that the camera sweeps across the room looking for solace and finds only distressed figures that are so traumatised they have already begun the inevitable, hunched over wait for the next wave. Oskar Sala's symphony creeps into the ears as it matches the growing darkness descending over the roof and room (not unlike another pivotal, frightening scene in the car from Psycho). Gashes appear on the wooden door and Mitch hurries to barricade the weakness, briefly muffling the screeches, before they are assaulted by another cacophony of shrieks from the right. The scene is as much aural as it is visual; the birds manage to snuff out even the last feeble lights, plunging the humans into an abyss, but it is the implied threat of the mass of sound overhead and all around that strikes fear into their hearts. It's a clever reversal - the film starts in a pet store, with caged birds that rattle and chirp from their cages, and by the end it is the humans who are the ones having the walls of their cage banged and rattled.But first there is the setup, which to Hitchcock is just as important as the payoff. He creates what is basically a nuclear test site, so pristine and so idyllic that there must be something hiding behind the edges. The characters are pointed caricatures, and clash in the most obvious of ways. Melanie Daniels is the prissy, delicate daddy's girl, who walks with a model's poise and an immaculate sense of dress. Hitchcock discovered Tippi Hedren in a commercial and recreates it in the opening here, with her striding across the street in those long legs and heels and greeting an audacious wolf-whistle with a dazzling smile. It's such an obviously enclosed moment, ripped straight from the spotless, faux-reality of television, but that is the idea; she is the pretty blonde taken to the extreme so it is all the more shocking when she is ripped apart and defiled (one might also theorise that Hitchcock and Hedren's strained relations play into this treatment). Melanie is a socialite, which means that her primary occupation is attracting scorn from baser, plainer women for how she prances about, flaunting her beauty, promiscuity and coquettishness. She is a direct opposite for the more moderate competition. The dumpy, despondent schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, who has an acute self-awareness of her character and knows that she has no chance with Mitch. And Lydia, the domineering and possessive mother, who is everything that Melanie is not; the unadorned, conservative housewife, who has remained rooted in her traditional feminine place (her nest, you might say) while she was splashing around the world naked in fountains. Oh, it's a wicked, wicked portrait that Hitchcock paints, and so it is all the more savage when he tears it apart.They are all fighting over Mitch, and why not? Rod Taylor plays the absolute paragon of manhood, a high-end lawyer with enough flexibility and sensibility to easily juggle his work and his family. The star pair meet cute in the bird-shop, trading barbed dialogue and sarcastic quips that thinly veil their instant attraction to each other. He also shows an inkling of mischief that makes him all the more intriguing, and because it is a movie, she is able to instantly track him down and turn up the next moment without any fuss. How romantic. And then slowly but surely, signs of the birds and their violent intent begin to reveal themselves. After the initial seagull bombardment Hitchcock has a brief interlude where we think we might be let off. There are the usual archetypes; the kooky, disheveled cryptic that interrupts periodically with warnings of the impeding doomsday, and the venerable British expert who waves off any concern with a bit of common sense. So pandemonium, and then silence, and the uncomfortable lull that accompanies it. Only after Melanie's beauty is scarred and tainted can the birds cease their attack. Only then, when her threat is extinguished and her blonde curls tightly wrapped and soiled by the smear of blood, can she lay under the wing (heh) of Lydia's motherly nurture. But the birds are not so quick to forget. In that stunning final shot of the car in its agonising crawl towards San Francisco, they cover every spare inch of the frame, an oppressive wall of dread as dark as the night itself. As Mitch starts the car the screeches begin to build again, as if they are daring him to make a wrong move.",9,1,2,13 August 2016
Princess Mononoke," Mononoke-hime
","Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is big, brash and lyrical, bringing together several different ancient worlds into a new order where co-existence seems impossible. The film has been called the Star Wars of the east, but surely it is more than simply that, with a confidence and fluidity in its action-driven world building that immediately signals to us that these clans have existed for a very long time, and want to desperately continue that tradition. Then one day man discovered that iron ore could be forged into new and powerful tools, and the earth was broken to excavate it, and lines were drawn in the sand. Miyazaki has never been shy about his moral lessons. His debut Nausicaa, from way before Studio Ghibli was even established let alone a household name, pitted its eponymous heroine in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where toxic fumes (man-made, presumably) had corrupted nature and its beasts, and only underground gardens housed plant life. Here in Mononoke you can see its influence from the beginning, in the way that the boar god Nago has been corrupted by an iron ball shot into his stomach, and how the evil spirits writhe and attempt to consume him. Their movements, each individually hand-drawn, become a furious, teeming mass that is immediately reminiscent of the gigantic, mutated Ohm with their churning legs. Like the Ohm, Nago is an intelligent creature that has been reduced to baser instincts because of humanity's stain. The apes likewise have taken on a hellish appearance, and resorted to eating unnatural things. Made 13 years later, Mononoke is Nausicaa but matured in almost every way. You could never equal the original imprint of 80s tone and mysticism, backed up by a Joe Hisaishi score that found beauty in the strange, alien landscape (the haunting children's choir is a testament to that). But the allegorical tapestry of Mononoke has no animated equal; it attempts no less than to account for every horse in the race for the forest, and in doing so lifts early didacticism into a universal fable. Seeing it on the big screen for the first time, I marvel again at the artistry of Ghibli's animators. They twist beauty and corruption into one with their matte backgrounds; the whole damn world is under the curse of evolution and technological advancement, and the untouched nature is slowly bearing its scars. An early shot of an oxen delivery inching its way across a spiky mountain range and fog is reminiscent of the magnificence of Herzog's Aguirre, and how the opening dwarfs its tiny humans. In the midst of pure streams, still lakes and thick forests they draw cartoon violence that is undeniably shocking for the medium. Even Ashitaka trembles at how his corrupted arm lends him an otherworldly strength that allows his arrows to cleanly behead a chasing samurai. The pale Kodama seem cute at first, until they twist their heads all the way around and shiver, sending unease down our spines. And no one animates emotion quite like Miyazaki. When his characters run, they stumble and grasp for the ground, and almost leave skid marks turning corners. There's no run cycle in sight. Look how he evokes anger through the whole body; eyes widen, brows arch like caterpillars, hair bristles up as if charged with electricity. But nothing quite compares to the anger of the forest spirit in search of his stolen head from the invaders of his domain. Watching it I am filled with both thrill and fear; to have Miyazaki unleash the figurative fury of mother nature is to rebuke all previous images of the serene, gentle spirit. Does it simply give in to those who are poisoning the land? No, it has lived in peace for millennia and has not yet been challenged by individuals so powerful and careless at the same time. It launches a self-destructive last resort. It seeks to consume. There is Miyazaki's caution of the modern world, of its unchecked progress and uncertainty, but this time around he also sees how it can bring new life for those previously downtrodden. Lady Eboshi rescues the women from filthy brothels and gives them good, hard work, and entrusts to the marginalised lepers the most important job of them all. She is not simply evil incarnate, but perhaps short-sighted. Her arrogance in her tools leads her to believe that she can kill a god, and she loses a hand for this. But she learns, and the town grows again. Ashitaka and San are the ones to bring true balance to the war. San herself is a discarded product of the conflict, neither fully wolf nor human. She reacts initially with an almost animalistic, blind rage, like that Okkoto, who has been fighting too long to see sense. And in the end, although she comes to accept that their must be give and take for both sides, cannot forget what the humans have done on behalf of progress. It is refreshing to see a film not so easily discard its character's convictions. A western film might have poised the romance as dramatic resolution. Yet Ashitaka knows that such atrocities are not quickly forgotten, and that only time can begin to heal them. One day that seedling may become a tree.",10,0,0,19 September 2017
High Fidelity," Is this the new Green Day?
","Rob Gordon is stuck in middle-age purgatory, constantly flitting from relationship to relationship when asked to take an step forward and grow. Like Woody Allen's characters in his great romantic comedies, who couldn't help from making a joke of all but the gravest of situations, he segments and designates his life by his love of music. He and his two friends share this talent of musical elitism and snobbery; they spend all day berating the poor taste of their customers, they immediately try to define any real life scenario with the best song to fit, and then every now and again they even sell a record. But Stephen Frears isn't just playing the bad guy; Rob's passion for music, however snobbish, is authentic, and Frears finds a way to elicit not only humour out of it, but eventually good. They want to broaden the tastes of the wider public, and Cusack is so confident in his love for The Beta Band and their ability to turn heads and ears. When two youthful thieves run off with a bunch of records, they furiously give chase, before the confrontation turns into a hilarious argument about the poor taste of their stolen records. Frears plays this straight, making it funnier, but also seeding the roots of Rob's passion and eventual discovery of the pair's talent. Naturally, he wants to help foster and let others hear it too. Cusack is the perfect choice. He is a product of his early career, the teen movies, and he brings this experience and baggage into his portrayal of Rob. Much of the exposition has him talking and facing the camera, narrating his own story, as if he was one of those directors or writers who make themselves the main and best character. So the frames close in on his story, the backgrounds vanish, and Cusack motions and pours out his life story for the audience. His voice-over is angry, volatile, unable to consider any perspective other than his own, and has self-depreciating quality that swiftly sheds himself of any blame. Perplexed, he beings a journey of diving back into his past to discover exactly the reason for his failed relationships. When he meets an ex who is similarly despondent, he recognises the same signs of 'sad, single person culture', but has no empathy. He is too high and mighty for that. The best scenes of the film come from his back and forth with his most recent ex-girlfriend Laura, who has finally had enough and packed the bags. This is where Rob is at his most self-righteous, most unaware. The messy breakup process is very clearly painful for her to, but Rob is only concerned with himself, so he sabotages each encounter with her with crass, unimportant queries. He feels entitled to have a say in the negotiation of this period, so he assaults her with a barrage of requests and phone-calls, and because she is much nicer and more mature than him, she plays along. Rob seems to have picked out the score for the film himself; when it seems certain that they will not get back together, it croons with Velvet Underground. And in a moment which completely illustrates his lack of sensitivity and maturity, he jumps for joy to Queen's We Are the Champions, just because Laura has not yet consummated her next relationship. Very funny, and very sad indeed. But of course they do eventually, and Rob, whose short-sightedness prevented him from seeing so, descends back into the mopey, 'the whole world is against me routine'. He calls her in the night, soaking in the rain and holding back tears, blubbering and trying to win her back. This act is so perfectly reminiscent of Cusack's iconic moment in Say Anything, holding the stereo aloft all night. The connection works because Cusack is no longer a teenager, but still held ransom by these teenage swings of emotion, so heart-wrenching he can barely function. What prevents High Fidelity from being a great film is how it momentarily slips up into soppy, conventional romantic comedy territory. Much of the film is ruthless in its dissection of Rob's faults, but it all falls into place like a typical romance does when he and Laura get back together. Laura is barely a character here; she simply flops over for him, conveniently sweeping Ian aside to reward an undeserving Rob with sex. It so clearly feels like one of his 'cool' fantasies that I was begging for the scene to rewind. Instead the film acts like a broken record, skipping ahead of the implied complications to that sweet-toothed ending. It isn't a bad ending; there is nothing wrong with expecting Rob to pick up the pieces of his life and finally move forward in his relationship. But it does seem like a bit of a let off.",8,2,2,23 July 2016
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Hot damn! It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!
","O Brother Where Art Thou is a magical retelling of Homer's Odyssey weaved through rural Mississippi during the great depression. The Coens draw us into the setting with ease; times of economic desperation, growth of chain stores (and stay out of Woolsworths!), the rise and spread of music through radio, populist politicians appealing through sweeping campaigns and folksy country western music, racial tensions behind public image...There's also the reference's to the Greek myth that blend seamlessly with the period piece: a boisterous and large man as Polyphemus (John Goodman), three haunting and mesmerising girls bathing by the river as the Sirens, a prophetic blind old man as Tiresias...The film blends this narrative with its setting so well, at times almost dream like in its atmosphere - take the soul-stirring choral rendition of Down to the River to Pray by a mass of baptismees, as the camera gracefully unveils the progression heading to down the river and Everett and Delmar's conversation about gophers comes to a standstill in amazement. Confronted with a lush green Mississippi upon principal photography, the Coens enlisted long time collaborator Roger Deakins to oversee a ground-breaking digital colour correction process that saw the fields of green turned into a dry and dusty rural canvas. The browns of the sepia tone seep into the frame and enhance the already dirty and ragged look of our trio of escapees (mistakenly identified as coloured after days of weary grimy travel by the KKK). Whenever you get the chance, make sure you watch the correct version with this post production process in it, otherwise be treated with garishly jarring green fields in the background. And of course the boys hauling the blocks of dripping ice across the fields becomes a less immersive image.George Clooney plays the leading man Ulysses Everett McGill, full of charm and suaveness. Twice he wakes up from his slumber to worries of his perfect hair being ruined (I'm a Dapper Dan man!), and despite his overall easiness and wisdom he still exhibits some peculiar insecurities or emotional tangents, but his best lines come from his exasperation or cheerful sardonic quips (Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere! and Baptism! You two are just dumber than a bag of hammers!). The second smartest of the three is Pete Hogwallop, despite his name possessing heart, with Turturro hitting a wide range of notes including the absurd (Do. Not. Seek. The. Treasure) and over-the-top humour (I'm gonna kill you, Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!). The funniest is Delmar, played with such heart and good intentions by Tim Blake Nelson, always curious but naive (We thought you was a toad!). There's a sort of gullible and lovable idiocy about Delmar that can only be displayed by Nelson and that big smile, whether it's the grand sweeping gesture as he indicates that the water is indeed fine, or the sympathy he shows for the livestock. Delmar is the glue that holds the group together (Okay, I'm with you fellas). If you haven't already figured out, OBWAT is endlessly quotable. They're joined by a varied host of colourful and memorable characters, like the humble Tommy, a black guitarist who sold his soul to the devil for his wicked talent, the well rounded and grinning Nelson, feared through the state for his machine gun and babyface (but don't say that in front of him), the well endowed Pappy O'Daniel and his escort, irate but a politician through and through, and the reform candidate Homer Stokes, well mannered and good natured but possessing seedier ideals underneath. He's revealed as the Imperial Wizard of the KKK at a nightime rally, the mass choreography and the fiery chants managing to look ominous and over-the-top ridiculous at the same time. But what would OBWAT be without it's immensely successful and award winning soundtrack, that perfectly sets the mood for the southern Depression-era tale? It features a impressive cast of country, bluegrass and folk musicians: Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Norman Blake, Ralph Stanley and of course the jaunty and effortless voice of Dan Tyminski on the iconic Man of Constant Sorrow. That and many of the rustic two and three part harmonies blend so easily in the story world and with those warm accompaniments of guitar, mandolins and banjos. Who didn't cheer when Delmar and and Pete launching straight into the harmonious intro in that hall? Its musical romp is simply infectious. As the radio station manager says, it's some mighty fine a-pickin' and a-singin.",9,1,1,17 August 2015
