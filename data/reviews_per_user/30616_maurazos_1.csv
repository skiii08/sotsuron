Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 10's for Borat? Did the world become crazy?
","I can't believe what I can read. 40% of people voted 10 for Borat! Do they actually consider this film as a masterpiece? Must 'Borat' be considered in the same level as 'Potemkin', 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather'? This is incredible! Are the film likes of people really going down, up to the point of considering 'Borat' one of the best films of the history? Must be IMDb considered as a serious website to learn about cinema and know more about films from serious opinions and scores given by the audience? Is the world in a really bad social and health situation than an insane racist and sexist film can be considered as a must see film? Aren't there better movies over there? In addition, the horrible and rude script is not the only bad point of this movie: technical aspects, like photography and music, help to make this film be one of the worst I've ever seen.",1,15,28,29 April 2007
