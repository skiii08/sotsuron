The Blair Witch Project," The final summary of this film.........
","The Blair Witch project had without a doubt more suspense than any other film ever.  However the ending was a huge letdown.  Dont deny it folks, you know you were just like me gripping to the seat saying 'Oh god! Their not going to find......'  as the ending approached.  It was weird though how the film made me feel.  I knew it was fake yet because of the way they presented the film, it was like I instantly adjusted to it and felt that it was as real as ordinary life.  It doesnt matter what I or you think about this film.  Everyone who saw this film reacted differently and it will be appreciated by some and hated by some.  So if you like it, great!  If you didnt, sorry you were disappointed.  It was amazing that when I saw it, my girlfriend told me afterwards how horrible it was, yet how come she turned her head and was trembling as the ending neared?  Just wondering!",10,2,4,11 September 1999
