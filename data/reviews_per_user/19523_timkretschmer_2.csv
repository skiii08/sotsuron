Raiders of the Lost Ark," The first step on the way to a really good Idiana Jones movie!
","Why do I think the third Indiana Jones is far more better and thus deserves to be voted better than the first one does: 1.) It has the right humor. Indy is not so dogged like in the first one. 2.) It features a beautiful woman, not a strange and manlike wannabe beauty like 'Raiders' does. 3.) It features a sophisticated screenplay with character development and supporting subplots. 4.) It shows us more of the great location where it is staged on. 5.) It features better actors like Sean Connery is. So, to make my point as clear as possible: 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' lacks exactly these five points. - In spite of this, it is a good movie and, after all, the one in which the basic idea of Indiana Jones is introduced. But if you can only see one Indiana Jones, than please do yourself a favor and choose the 'Last Crusade'",5,4,14,16 February 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Definitely the best Indiana Jones until now!
","It seems as if Lucas and Spielberg have needed three tries to figure out how an Indiana Jones movie works best. In Last Crusade they did nearly everything as it should be done. It's the one which feels the most like a James Bond movie does - and this is what the both wanted to achieve according to the common rumors and what I personally like the most. The movie has the right amount of humor, wonderful locations, interesting characters, a sophisticated story and, of course, breathtaking action and suspense. Maybe one could have cast the female part more carefully choosing an equally beautiful actress which happens to cause more chemistry in interaction with Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Nonetheless Alison Doody is far the best 'Jonesgirl' we've seen until now. Hopefully Lucas and Spielberg progress again in the next sequel announced for 2008 - if not, they will not be able to blame it on a lack of time.",10,1,3,16 February 2007
