Alien 3," ALIEN 3 is bad, but had promising ideas...
","Alien3, although a somewhat messy script, killing off Clemens (Charles Dance) far too early and the appalling cgi alien effects....I must say that this movie does have some soul and substance, however little... i loved the concept of the prison and the crazy prisoners seeking redemption at the 'ass end of space' as ripley puts it.The movie looks and feels very different to the previous two, having the sepia tint instead of the constant claustrophobic shadowy sets of the first two movies. Opening it up in what feels like much bigger set pieces.Dillon (played by Charles S. Dutton) was excellent, probably the only fully realised character in the whole movie, with some real emotion and depth.Ripley was very different, and inconsistent at times, one minute the fighting machine we know her to be, the next minute she's sexual and feminine. Don't know if the ripley in the previous 2 movies, after all shes endured would just hop into bed so quickly with the first guy who happens to be nice to her.Overall, I actually do like this movie, and obviously I'm sure that's due to the incredible talent that is David Fincher who had the impossible task of rescuing a doomed movie thanks to the money hungry producers Gordon Carroll, David Giler, Walter Hill who know NOTHING about ARTÂ…. They are the real reason why this movie ended up being such a mess. (watch the making of documentary on the special edition DVD and you'll see what I mean). May i also say i think it's disgusting how they treated Giger (the genius behind the design and look of the Alien and also the alien planet from the first movie). The Producers (who also wrote the crappy sequels that didn't work) at Fox are vile and are the sole reason the franchise has turned to 'crud'.To all those who hate Alien3, you should watch it again from a fresh perspective, if you think this is bad you should see Alien Resurrection and the Alien V Predator movies. So bad it hurts.",Null,0,2,1 September 2009
