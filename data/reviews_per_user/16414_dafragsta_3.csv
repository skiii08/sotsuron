The Longest Yard," A good movie to watch with your football viewing buddies.
","Art-house snob or Bruckheimer bandwagoneer, you see a movie like this and know you are just being facetious to make cracks about how it won't be as good as the original. I'm not the biggest Adam Sandler fan and some of his movies I just outright loathe. Somehow I end up buying and watching most of them again and again. (Eight Crazy Nights and 50 First Dates notwithstanding, even then, I can't help but think of Sean Astin's antics in that movie.) Check the director and the lead role credits and your expectations for a shot-for-shot remake should be in the toilet, but who really wants that anyway? This movie is fun. Burt Reynolds adds to the cool cred and I get the impression that he had a lot of fun making it, rather than just seeing a quick way to collect a check.An admirable job was done; shoving a crowbar between The Waterboy and The Longest Yard, though there are a few funny references to the former. It was a gamble to take a somewhat redundant stab at Sandler's somewhat niche (but according to his box office reciepts, not that niche) market, but it plays out well and the humor is different now that Adam Sandler is the cool guy on the team rather than the team dork.",7,0,0,8 October 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Good right up until the end.
","This movie was considerably better than Matrix Reloaded. I think for the most part it tied things up nicely and left just enough loose ends to potentially extend the story. I would also say that Revolutions had a very 'Return of the Jedi' vibe going on. The switching between multiple places worked almost as well as Jedi and the ending left me looking for Ewoks.The acting is lukewarm with one exception. Hugo Weaving earned his paycheck a few times over. Just when I think a monotonous character is doomed to getting an emotionless performance, Mr. Weaving proves me wrong.As I said before, my biggest beef with Matrix: Revolutions is the ending. The final fight is anticlimactic as is everything that follows. Sure there's peace between the humans and the machines but it felt like the directors were ordered to cut it short for fear of the movie running long.",8,4,8,7 April 2004
Meet the Fockers," People are way to easy on this movie.
","The most surprising thing about this movie was that I actually liked Barbara Streisand in it, and I figured my tendencies would reject her on principle. I say this is the most surprising thing because this is this is the most blatant use of sequel-sploitation I've seen in film-making. Let me sum up every joke in Meet the Fockers.'Hey! Remember that really funny moment in Meet the Parents? Here's a reminder of that joke because we couldn't make new ones for this movie.' I usually don't like to go on rants about 'what's wrong with Hollywood' but rest assured if there is something wrong with Hollywood, this is it. Austin Powers 2 was a big romp through past jokes, but somehow that still came off fresh and funny. This movie is more recycled than the only towel at pie-eating contest. Dustin Hoffman's performance was very generic and he definitely phoned this one in. I could say the same for every other person in this cast except Striesand who might've been trying to win some points with the younger audience who mostly know her from her non-flattering appearances South Park... present company included.",5,0,1,29 March 2005
