The Incredible Hulk," Time to end the franchise.
","I don't know why, but the Hulk has enjoyed very limited success on the silver screen. I remember watching the cartoons as a kid, I wasn't a huge fan but it was enjoyable. I didn't quite enjoy the first one by Ang Lee, and I barely managed to finish Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk, despite it starring Edward Norton who is one of my favorite actors.Edward is so wasted here. His role does not require any special skills or talents at all, Bruce Banner could've been played by Matt Damon and it would just be the same. The reason I used Damon as an example is because he is also good at playing characters on the run, ala the Bourne series. I honestly did not really notice any of Norton's special acting abilities, such as his intense speeches or extremely in-depth moments. Bruce Banner is just a guy on the run, and a bit of a romantic. Liv Tyler is even worse, she is her usual bland self. She's quite good looking, but I remember her from Lord of the Rings and Armageddon, and she played the SAME bland characters with her bland emotionless acting. This isn't a criticism of her acting ability as a whole, since I haven't seen all her films, but her role contributes even more boring to an already very boring film. To make matters worse, The Incredible Hulk is filmed so dark, even darker than The Dark Knight. I could barely make out the last action scene. Oh and I know we should suspend belief for action hero flicks like these, but in the last scene where the helicoper ripped vulcan cannon fire at the Hulk right onto civilian buildings... uhh okay..... It's odd really, what is it with superhero films and bland acting? Toby Maguire's Spider-Man, Christian Bale's Batman (incredible actor, but again his abilities severely limited as Bruce Wayne), Neo in The Matrix, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars II. I guess Robert Downey Jr's Ironman is one of the more successful projects in recent times, which is why the movie ended up so popular and even worthy of comparison to the powerhouse that is The Dark Knight. Ironically, the last scene reflects this as if to add insult to injury.",Null,2,5,25 September 2008
Training Day," Didn't like it when it first came out, now i remember why.
","I saw this movie when it first came out. I liked it a lot, the setting, the acting, the storyline was fantastic. But I never really got hooked on it like some people who still to this day, worship it like some kind of cult movie. Back then I didn't fully understood the ending, but I just didn't like it.Today I rented it to watch it again because even to this day, people still bring it up for comparison like with Street Kings, so it seems like it's set a standard for this particular genre. Well, now I remember why I didn't like the ending back then. It was unrealistic. Training Day is all about realism, all about the streets. So how the hell did Denzel get beaten by the rookie, who somehow survived getting killed by the 3 Latino's because one of them decided to grab his wallet before popping him, checks the wallet, sees the photo of the schoolgirl who somehow Jake had saved earlier that day. Unbelievable... and why didn't they just kill him? Why beat him up, why not choke him to death then take him to the bathtub. Won't leave much of a mess either.So Training Day is a very good movie with an Oscar-winning performance from Denzel, but the ending was typical Hollywood 'good cop wins' ending. I guess I'm spoiled by the more modern films which are much more gritty and cruel. Jake (Ethan) wasn't just a good cop, he was NAIVE. I wish there was some kind of twist were Jake screws Denzel over at his own game, without having to resort to pure luck and inconceivable behavior from Denzel where he spares him on the rooftop rather than finishing him off. Unfortunately, unless Jake smartens up and 'becomes the next Alonzo', he will get killed within two months if he goes on to pursue a Narc career. I just hope that for his sake, he gets a desk job or goes back to patrol.The ratings are fair, Training Day is good but nowhere near Top 250 good. The people who go all ga-ga over it and the ending are all teenagers, or equally naive people who still think good people have good things happen to them. Wrong... it's the SMART people that live. Jake was a liability to the force, even if he lives by the end of the movie, if he continues his do-goody ways, he will most likely get popped by some other bad cop. It's unfortunate but nowadays it requires a hell of a lot more than integrity to become, and survive as a good cop. You need to learn politics.",Null,2,3,23 May 2008
Troy," Apollo wept.
","Troy should've been an UNDISPUTED EPIC. The battle scenes were brilliant, almost Lord of the Rings-esquire, but a bit shorter in spans as true to history. Unfortunately, they ruined it by HAVING LEGOLAS SAVE THE DAY.I couldn't believe how the movie ended. I knew Achilles would die, anyone who paid attention in history class knows how he died and the famous term 'Achilles Heel'. I just could've believe Orlando Bloom as ruined yet ANOTHER movie. Totally one dimensional, the producers decided to ride on his Legolas fame and destroyed this otherwise fantastic film. Bloom's character, Paris, can't fight for sheet with a sword or a spear, so he starts using a bow and completely owns everyone in the end. And people rip on Keanu Reeves for being wooden? At least he can play a larger variety than 'Prettyboy' Orlando Bloom. I mean they totally ruined his character Paris by making him look like a coward. HOW DOES HELEN FALL FOR THIS DISHONORABLE BOY? No, it's not Paris' fault, it's completely Orlando Bloom. And it's all you teenage girls who swoon over him, that are encouraging him to continue riding on his Legolas fame-train and now every movie that needs a cheap boost in ratings and box office numbers just employ him for those lovey-dovey scenes. After he shot Achilles 5 times despite Briseis pleading with him, I wished Briseis would walk up and just stab him. And what's with this 'love' theme? I can understand heroes going home every night to love their wives, but they really overdid it in Troy. I mean think Titanic... think of the death scene.... then watch Troy. It's Titanic x 4. Yes that's right, every single death scene is a tear jerker for the preteen. It's sad to see Troy under the 7.0 mark at the time of this review, but the scores don't lie. Unfortunately 'Troy' will not be remembered for very long after we die.Please please don't let Wolfgang direct another Iliad classic like this, my heart can't take it anymore. And they didn't even bother to show Orlando Bloom's death. Yes that's right folks, he NEVER made it out of Troy, he was mortally wounded and his wife begged his former lover Oenone to heal him, who refused because of his playboy lifestyle and dumping her for Helen. And he died pathetically. Obviously this can never be shown in the movie as it would ruin the whole point of having Bloom in there now would it!!",Null,2,6,29 May 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Snape was always the coolest Harry Potter character.
","Sorry for the title but I had to get it off my chest, Alan Rickman's Severus Snape was always my favorite character from the Harry Potter series, and I'm not even a fan of those movies. He delivers a charismatic performance in this wonderful musical masterpiece.And what a masterpiece it was. Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is like no other. The songs are extremely memorable and will play inside your head for days to come. It is quite bloody though, so I don't think it's suitable for a family viewing, which is quite a shame, because it is one of the best musicals I have ever seen from Warner Bros. The duets are mind-blowing and perfectly synchronized. Johnny Depp is always awesome, but it's the characters around him that make the movie, except for the Judge (Alan Rickman), whose background is never really explained, but his on screen presence is so powerful that it more than makes up for the lack of character depth.Definitely watch this, if you can enjoy a fine work of art. Well done Mr.Burton, John Logan (screenplay), and Stephen Sondheim (musical)!",Null,0,0,18 February 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Ben's directorial debut is classy, but much of the credit goes to......
","Ben's directorial debut is classy, but much of the credit goes to the stylish cinematography. The storyline itself, IMO, isn't anything new despite the numerous twists. Definitely see it if you're a fan of the genre. It starts out slow and boring, but do try to pay attention because the smaller details do matter later on.About Casey Affleck however, I remember seeing him in smaller roles in the past, but never really noticed him. Then he became the talk of the town with numerous recognitions for Jesse James, which I have yet to see but plan to rent it right after this. IMO he does a decent job here in Gone Baby Gone but lacks a bit of emotion, and his style of speech is very debatable. His mumbling is unique and probably acceptable for one or two choice characters, but if he always talks like this then it tends to go against him. He is still very far from other fine actors like Christian Bale, but is one to look out for. Decent performance in this film, but the real star here is Ed Harris, absolutely brilliant and shamefully underrated.",Null,0,0,15 February 2008
Burn After Reading," Typical Coen!
","It may not be Snatch, but it has similar elements such as everyone's plots intertwined with each other, and lots of funny dialogue. Definitely not a movie to be taken seriously, which is sad when so many people try to scrutinize it for accuracy and realism. The star studded cast is greatly important as they all act quirky and especially George Clooney, who I used to dislike because of his constant smug demeanor (I used to label him a one trick pony, or a prettyboy), but I'm really liking his new acting style and he is proving his versatility.The score is absolutely brilliant, and contributes immensely to the film.Definitely enjoyable if one is a fan of the Coens, there are a few fantastic laugh out loud scenes that make re-viewing a necessity.",Null,1,6,15 November 2008
21," Good in certain parts, awful towards the end.
","Good god, this is a movie of two halves. The first half is fantastic, I'll be frank here I pretty much loved it. I hadn't read the book, and I might if i ever get the chance, but i REFUSE to acknowledge that i HAVE to read the book to be entertained by a movie. I'm just a regular movie-goer, I knew about '21' from checking out Now Playing, strolled into a theatre and went for a ride. The first half was amazing, the concept was very interesting and keeps you engrossed in. Everyone loves Vegas/gambling movies... the exciting, high-rolling lifestyle, the glamor, the fun. Unfortunately it kind of dropped off near the middle, and completely sank in the end with the textbook Hollywood ending where the hero 'learns a life experience' after screwing up. I heard that the script was altered from the book, and judging from the popularity I can only assume the book was really good (and very real), so the screenwriters should really hang.Seriously, they killed the movie. After the so-called 'twists', it just isn't enjoyable anymore because it becomes predictable and there are plot holes that keep popping up and leaving you in a state of What-The-Eff! I can never understand why the hero (I didn't even bother to remember his name) keeps his money stashed in the ceiling of his room. I'm just surprised his cash wasn't bitten to pieces by mice. There were parts so cringeworthy, that I just couldn't give this movie anything higher than a 5 despite some decent entertainment in the beginning. It gets another point deducted because of the AWFUL acting. The hero's so called 'acting' is completely wooden, I didn't know there could be someone more wooden than Paul Walker out there. His concept of being ticked off or disgruntled, is pulling a smirk and then turning his head away. What is he, some 13 year old teenage girl who's just been denied by her parents to go to the party? Even poor Kevin Spacey got dragged through the mud, his character acting completely OTT when his favorite student (the hero) messes up once, losing I think most or all of his money that he brought along, but he goes NUTS. Since all the MIT students acted like high school freshmen (immature babies), I'm surprised he wasn't more tolerant. The only characters to get any credit were the two Asian kids, the girl played a steady consistent role, and Aaron Yoo, although not an Oscar worthy performance, he always has his own unique style and he again plays it successfully here, playing the easy going laid-back guy. Wait a minute, then again I can't remember his character doing anything significant during the gambling either. Strange... I thought the original MIT team consisted of mostly Asian-Americans. Hmm. And the jealous kid, I think his name was Fisher, was so bad that the movie didn't even give a shoot about him after he got kicked out. I thought he might come back for revenge or something but no, he's completely irrelevant. Wow. And what about their disguises in the final scene. The textbook Mr.Potatohead spectacles and moustache. Classy.So all in all, if you don't mind B-grade acting, a cliché storyline and overlooking painfully obvious plot holes just to get a few cheap Vegas thrills, be my guest. I'm just disappointed because it could've been SO MUCH MORE. Using mathematics (card counting) to beat the system in Vegas, it could've been a classic.",Null,1,1,28 May 2008
Tropic Thunder," Top, top comedy
","An absolutely hilarious comedy and parody with actors literally making fun of themselves and their careers. And like a famous person once said, Ben Stiller needs to be made into liquid form so that we could inject him into our veins. The man is simply born funny! And with an all star cast with Robert Downey Jr. (one of his best performances recently), Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Brandon Jackson, and Tom Cruise who puts in one of the most surprising and almost show stealing performances, you can't go wrong. Must see for any fans who have a decent enough sense of humor.And Tom Cruise is still the man. Love him or hate him, one cannot deny that he is still an incredibly talented actor on the stage. I don't pay too much attention to his personal life because I don't look up to the man, but I respect him and still feel he is one of the finest actors in the 90s and he is still putting out great performances these days.",Null,1,4,1 December 2008
Quantum of Solace," Where exactly is James Bond going?
","So I understand that they are taking James Bond to a new direction, into a new century and giving him a new outlook. Making him less silly (humorous) and more realistic, more efficient. But doesn't that sort of defeat the entire purpose? Ian Fleming's James Bond series is more than just a spy thriller. Where is the womanizing? Where is the witty dialogue and clever retorts? Where is the whole 'smile in the face of danger' from 007? James Bond is not a regular spy, he IS SUPPOSED to be over the top. He is supposed to make you smile and shake your head (but not laugh out loud). Don't get me wrong, Daniel Craig is a fine actor and all, but he just doesn't convince me as Bond. I have heard people suggest that he looks more like a Bond villain than Bond himself, and I have to agree, his cold emotionless face looks more brawn than brains. So I don't buy the the whole 'don't compare Craig with Connery, they are different' excuse. Sean Connery IS James Bond. Daniel Craig is just a fantastic action actor.The storyline is pretty bland. I won't go into detail with it because honestly, I wasn't paying full attention as I had lost it about halfway into the movie. I was simply disappointed that it's just scene after scene of fighting and killing, and not enough interacting. At one point I found myself wondering who would win in a duel between Daniel Craig's James Bond and Jason Bourne. They were that similar in style. Just watch any one of Bourne's films and compare for yourself. Yes I know before they released the movie they were already talking about how cold and efficient Bond would be in this movie, how he would be out for revenge. But James Bond also makes mistakes. Then he is either bailed out by beautiful women, or some amusing stroke of luck. Craig almost never screws up, he just kills and kills, then looks at his mobile phone for more info on the next target.Olga Kurylenko is a pleasant surprise however. Had I not seen Max Payne before this, I would have mistaken her completely for Sophie Marceau, who also played a Bond girl in 'The World Is Not Enough', they look so much alike. She is definitely a star on the rise. And trust Judi Dench to put in a great shift as always, she is probably the only James Bond character that looks legitimate as M in Quantum.I hate to say it but I think the James Bonds are simply getting worse. When Pierce Brosnan came onto the scene, he also received a fair share of criticism but looking back, he exceeds Craig in the suave department. I always liked his arrogant demeanor and the slight smile he always has on his face. Daniel Craig just looks like a tough guy, a 'don't mess with me or I'll snap your neck like a twig' look. Quantum of Solace is a decent action movie, so at least they didn't put 007 in the title, because it just has the characters but it is certainly not James Bond.To Craig's credit however, Casino Royale was surprisingly good. Let's hope if he is to continue the series, they bring back the old style, the AUTHENTIC feel of James Bond, and not just some cookie cutter all out action shoot-beat-em-up fest.",Null,4,6,1 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Breathtaking cinema.
","I am speaking figuratively. You know those moments where you find yourself holding your breath? That's how I felt when viewing Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. This movie is epic. I am not a big Batman fan, I don't own any comics, only read a few when I was a kid. And I have not felt this way since Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. But they are two completely different genres, LOTR was a CGI fest in a fantasy world, The Dark Knight is just fantastic direction in a (reasonably) realistic setting, a compelling storyline with many twists, gripping suspense, heart-thumping battles and brilliant music. I noticed that this time, there was more of a suspenseful ambiance type of sound or beat during the action scenes, rather than just the looped music that was present in Batman Begins, which made the scenes look more like music videos. The Dark Knight is true to its name, very dark indeed.This is a movie that you simply cannot see it just once, and I highly recommend multiple theatre viewings before buying the remastered DVD version. It's ranked #3 in the IMDb Top 250 at the time of this review, perhaps a little bit high in my opinion, but definitely top 20 material, maybe even 10. Time will tell if it can stay there.Christian Bale puts in one of hiss usual shifts, and anyone who has seen his movies (The Machinist, American Psycho, Reign of Fire) knows what he can do. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers, and puts in a very mature and believable performance that surpasses her predecessor. But Heath Ledger is the joker here, pun intended. He really shocked me with what he can do despite all the hype and trailers I had viewed beforehand, and hiding behind his hideous makeup gives him even more freedom and confidence to fully express and release himself. The unique thing about his Joker that makes him so successful is that he is not only intriguing to the audience, he still does a phenomenal job in making you loathe him. Many villains in other movies go over the top these days, which makes the viewer respect them in awe, but in the end fail to achieve their most important objective; the villain needs to be hated! You can't have the audience start feeling sorry for them, unless their character was intended that way. The Joker makes you shake your head in both awe, and disgust. Absolutely brilliant. Just like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Heath Ledger has raised the bar considerably, and put immense pressure on the next guy to play the villain, not just in Batman films but other superhero flicks as well. Eventually his performance may be surpassed, but it sure won't be easy and won't be too soon either! I daresay The Dark Knight could not only be the movie of the year, but also the movie of the decade. Around halfway into the movie, I was already reeling, I glanced at my watch and was shocked to realized it was only halfway. This is the kind of movie that you never want to end.",Null,5,10,17 September 2008
Green Street Hooligans," They are not gangs, they are hooligans.
","Hands down one of the best British films in the last decade, right up there with the likes of Trainspotting and This Is England. Green Street Hooligans takes you to the old firms of English football clubs, and while the portrayal may not be 100% realistic, it is the story telling that counts, and female director Lexi Alexander does an amazing job. The fight scenes were beautifully shot, and the message conveyed was excellent.It is not often where a movie is not only wonderfully directed, but also paired up with fantastic acting. This is one of those cases. Everyone in the movie was extremely convincing in their roles, especially the GSE (Green Street Elites), most notably Marc Warren (The Repairman from Wanted), Charlie Hunnam (as Pete, the GSE leader), and Geoff Bell (as Tommy Hatcher, leader of the Millwall firm). Geoff was only in a handful of scenes but his presence is amazing, he completely dominates on the screen. He is genuinely frightening. Throughout the movie there is a fair amount of banter (jokes) towards 'Yanks', but one line truly stood out as the ultimate diss: Pete insists that they are not gangs, but firms (hooligans actually), they do not drive around with guns and shooting at 8 year old little girls.The ending was a nice touch as well. Lexi Alexander has really outdone herself and hopefully she is involved with more projects in the future. Her directing style has a slight resemblance to Danny Boyle, both of them have a talent for showcasing stylish action scenes, and engrossing storytelling ability. Green Street Hooligans is a must watch for anyone interested in the footballing hooligan scene back in the 80s and 90s.",Null,0,0,7 March 2009
Hancock," Original
","I liked this movie because it was very different from the current crop of superhero flicks like Iron Man, Batman and Spider-Man. Will Smith pulls off his role wonderfully, and Charlize Theron is as beautiful as ever. Jason Bateman delivers as well but his character was a bit on the cheesy side, it's like they just got lazy and didn't bother to develop his character at all. I still have no idea what his ideals are for changing the world, other than giving free food and medicine to the third world? Really weird. Also I thought they dragged out Hancock's rehabilitation a bit too long, he was much funnier when he was being bitter and that was too short.Now about the plot. Some guy on the forums got it right. This is what he wrote, quote and unquote 'There was nothing wrong with the relationship in this movie, and there is nothing wrong with the idea that being in a loving relationship can force you to choose between it, and doing the right thing. Heroism is an act of total sacrifice. If one person in a relationship is constantly sacrificing themselves for something besides 'the relationship', it can easily take a toll on the other loved one.' I just wanted to emphasize that in this review. Hancock actually used his love to save Mary. In the end he was coming back to life anyways, he could have just let her die so he could be 100% immortal forever, but because he loved her, he saved her. I thought that was a really touching scene although possibly a bit confusing for some.Hancock is not as bad as some people make it out, it's definitely less intense than Iron Man but it's a breath of fresh air, and more realistic as we look into the personal lives of the superhero rather than fight scenes.",Null,2,5,13 September 2008
Iron Man," Exceeds expectations
","Starts out a little slow, but gets onto the good stuff immediately. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as Tony Stark, as does Gwyneth Paltrow whose very easy on the eyes, one of the best female leads in a superhero movie I've ever seen. Iron Man has some of the best special effects and cinematography and this is what saves it from being mediocre. The scene with the F-22 Raptors is one of the very best and most memorable, it was simply INTENSE. The final battle was okay, a duel between two robot suits, looked very much like Transformers if I'm being honest.The storyline was cack though. I'm not a follower of the comic books, but I really hated the whole Afghanistan back story. I watch superhero flicks to escape from the real world a little bit, not watch a guy in a robot suit bash the hell out of Middle Eastern terrorists. Although, the scenes where Iron Man flew in to save the day were quite moving and brilliant. There is much potential here and I very much look forward to sequels, I just hope his adversaries are more technologically advanced, and not real world villains or drug dealers. Although they could make pretty good cannon fodder.",Null,1,2,12 September 2008
Valkyrie," Underdog status made this movie a hell of an experience for me
","***NOTE*** This review contains minor spoilers, but they are historical spoilers, not fictional or movie plot spoilers.With all the negative reviews surrounding Valkyrie when it first released, it was way down the list of movies to see for most people. Most flocked to check out the Oscar nominees, or more popular titles like The Wrestler and Gran Torino, even Jim Carrey's Yes Man. But when I finally got around to seeing this once it premiered in Hong Kong, I was simply blown away.Tom Cruise, no matter how his personal life is, delivers on the silver screen where it matters. I've heard some professional critics complain that he was a bit stiff, but to be honest I have hardly ever seen the real Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg even in other films, so I wouldn't know how accurate Tom's portrayal was. The only thing I do know, is that he commanded most of the scenes in the movie. This is no easy task when you're up against Bill Nighy. The other supporting cast was excellent as well, especially Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Christian Berkel, who was absolutely wonderful as Colonel Quirnheim. I do not know too much of German actor Christian Berkel, apparently he was also in Der Untergang which I enjoyed very much, he was superb in Valkyrie. Another point of interest is that, despite already knowing the outcome of the plot, the ending scenes are still extremely gripping and emotional. Bryan Singer deserves much of the credit for an amazing job.As a closing note, no matter if you like or hate Tom Cruise, or whether or not you enjoyed the movie, it did a significant job portraying the brave men that stepped up and resisted. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, General Friedrich Olbricht, Herr Ludwig Beck, Herr Erwin von Witzleben, General Erich Fellgiebel, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim, and all those who lost their lives as a result of the assassination attempt; they tried, they did not succeed, but they will be remembered.",Null,3,5,3 March 2009
Semi-Pro," I gotta be honest here, it's one of Farrell's worst, but still made me laugh!
","I can't bare to see it below 6.0 but I can't give it 7, it's one of Ferrell's worst by far. Wedding Crashers, Talladega Nights (literally made me vomit with laughter, it was so OTT), Old School, and of course the classic Anchorman are all twice or even ten times better. But Semi-Pro was still funny in short spurts, so it's a decent watch ONLY if you don't have too much expectations.Will Ferrell's unique comedy style is very much in-your-face, sometimes even forced toilet humor so he's the kind of guy you either enjoy or hate with a passion. I think he's alright, he doesn't make me cringe as much as some other comedians, and sometimes he really hits it on the nail. He has a great supporting cast here to assist him and they have some great lines. If you like the 70's you will enjoy Semi-Pro. Watch out for the Hippie as well, he's a riot in his two or three scenes! And the two announcers have some great lines between each other.Unfortunately, Woody Harrelson is very much wasted here. Like Ferrell, he also has a quirky style and I was looking forward to both of them goofing off of each other, but he plays a serious role this time, he's the only guy on the team of semi-pros to have ever played in the NBA, and his storyline just sucks. Most of the character development sucks in Semi-Pro, this is one of the weakest areas of the film. You don't really care much for them, so you're only watching it for the funny lines and Ferrell's idiocy. I'm a fan of Woody so I was disappointed they cast him for this, let's hope he and Ferrell can work together in the future and create some more laughs. Definitely a rental for me, unless you're a Ferrell fan then by all means go see it immediately.",Null,1,2,6 June 2008
