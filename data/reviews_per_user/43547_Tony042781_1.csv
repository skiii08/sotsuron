The Avengers," Wow!
","I didn't think this movie would live up to the expectations that surrounded it. But luckily it did. whoever hasn't seen this movie yet, what the heck are you waiting for!? This is a great movie for comic book fans, kids, and anyone who loves some good ol action. I really didn't think this movie would've'e been as good as it was without Iron Man, Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America. So I loved everything about this movie:Acting, action, plot, special effects. The only problem I personally had was just that hulk wasn't in it as much as I wanted. But when he was there it was just epic. Also that the hulk really reminded me of a a gorilla at the end of the movie which i found just funny. But other than that I can ignore the fact that Odin just sent Thor to earth, the Chintari just dying after the mother ship blew up, and the excessive comedic relief. I found it quite strange that the world was in danger of being taken over and all the characters took it so lightly and making jokes. But still this movie was just awesome. 10/10 best movie this year.",10,3,8,4 June 2012
