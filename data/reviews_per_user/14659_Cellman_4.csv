The Blair Witch Project," The Worst Cinematography I have ever seen!
",This movie was one of the lamest movies that I have ever seen.  The only thing that made me happy when it was done is that I didn't spend $7 to go see.  I went to the local bargain theatre and saw it for only $2,3,0,1,15 July 2000
The Big Lebowski," IT SUCKED
","I realize that there are all these cinema people that have obviously voted some high marks for this movie,  that would be the only way to explain the high marks.  I was bored out of my mind!!   As far as I am concerned that means the movie sucks.",4,10,28,22 July 2000
The Beach," Great Film seen it twice!!!
","OK I will be the first to admit that I was not exactly looking forward to this movie.  I thought that it would be a great film for all the teenie boppers of the world.  I was pleasently suprised to find out it was a most enjoyable movie, that really sucks you in.   I wanted to sell my car and go to Thailand in search of an Island somewhere with white beaches.   The cinematics with all of the scenery was awe inspiring.   I loved it!!  The only thing that I didn't really like was how wacky Leo's character got at the end of the movie.  It was a little wierd,  OH well it was well worth going to.",10,0,1,26 March 2000
Spider-Man," BEST Comic Book movie ever made!!
","First off, if you are one of those pathetic film students that is super critical of anything that comes out in a mainstream theatre you can just GO TO HELL!!!  I get so sick of you guys being critical of movies like this.  I can just imagine all the comments you guys are dreaming up in your little heads. <P>People are going to see this movie because they enjoy superheroes.  I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed.  The last few comic book movies were big disappointments, with maybe the exception being the first Superman movie.  Spiderman is a movie that young and old can enjoy.   As the movie grew to a close I found myself wishing that I could go see Spiderman 2 as soon possible.  This movie was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen this year.  I might even go see it again.",10,0,0,5 May 2002
