Mission: Impossible III," Exactly as billed...an action thrill ride!
","For those of you expecting memorable dialog or an intriguing plot, you'll probably be disappointed. You see this movie for the action...period.In the early scenes of the movie, we learn that Ethan has found love and has traded in his field days to train new IMF agents. He's happy and content, until he learns that one of his favorite recruits has been kidnapped. Once he gets pulled into the rescue game, the action grabs you and doesn't let go. I found myself clenched through most of the movie, and only during the rare 'relationship' scenes did I realize that I had been holding my breath.Things really heat up when Ethan crosses a sadistic villain (with a chilling performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman), who kidnaps Ethan's wife. The love scenes come off as a bit cheesy, but exist to explain Ethan's transition from cool-as-ice agent to a man desperate to save the woman he loves.This movie is full of what has made the Mission Impossible series so fun: devilishly clever schemes, the occasionally funny dialog, and most importantly, the mind-blowing gripping action.",7,0,0,13 May 2006
