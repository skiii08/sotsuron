Hereditary," A horror film for the ages.
","Wow...where to start...
this film is probably the most unsettling film i have ever seen. The traditional jump scare tactics are left behind in this. this taps into your brain leaving you with a horrible imprint that will leave you with the lights on when you sleep.
its an absolute emotional roller coaster. from utter despair to sheer terror. the acting from toni and Gabriel is just something to behold.
for me this has to be up there with one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. the ending may not be to everyones taste. but i for one absolutely LOVED it",10,1,2,28 September 2018
