The Ring," Pretty scary
","I think this was a pretty good movie. It had an intriguing idea. I think the use of the videotape was pretty creative. However, there did not seem to be much fulfillment at the end of the movie. The film was pretty suspenseful and not boring. I think it was a pretty good film. The film was quite imaginative but not realistic. You could not watch a videotape and die. I think that the images in the videotape and the story that explained the images was well done. I think it is better than many other horror films. The young boy, Aidan, in the film was pretty good. I think that after seeing it you might feel that something creepy will happen to you and this feeling might last for awhile.I think that it was a pretty good film.",Null,1,2,29 August 2004
