Alien 3," Hugely Underrated
","David Fincher: 'a lot of people hated Alien 3, but no one hated it more than I did.'Don't listen to him. I've just finally got around to the 145min special edition of this film, and it's fantastic to see what a misunderstood gem it really is. OK, so it's not a 10/10, but I felt it deserved that for the trashing it gets here otherwise. Still by no means perfect - it essentially follows the same course as the original film - but with the guts put back into the special ed, what you get is a wonderfully twisted attempt to bring the alien series to a close. What's brave, and almost unique for a sequel, is its ceremonious trashing of any continuity fostered in the previous films, and its aversion to any kind of easy, sentimental notion of hope or optimism (no, she's not going to have children. Or get married...) With the alien itself desperate to protect its own survival, the story hones in on the irrational, pessimistic body horror at the centre of the series, and, well... doesn't wimp out. The original theatrical version was fatally cut to pieces by executives, but frankly I'm amazed this got filmed in the first place. It's fantastic that this exists as even a work-in-progress - after the action-fest of Aliens it seems like blatant commercial suicide. So anyhow, all this guff aside, seek out the special ed of this film and take a look.",10,8,70,21 August 2008
Prometheus," Alien Remix
","This film feels more like the product of a Ridley Scott brainstorming session rather than a fully realised story - take some Alien, some philosophic sci-fi and some mythic tropes, then reheat with great actors and production design. It doesn't really work as a story, although its solid enough and there's plenty of interesting ideas with Fassbender's robot and the thankfully still mysterious origins of the alien (for instance that prologue); it reminds you why Ridley Scott has been such a great sci-fi filmmaker.So, more intelligent than you can rightly expect from an alien film at this point, but I can't help feeling that it would have been stronger if they'd abandoned the connections with the earlier film altogether.",6,3,9,2 June 2012
