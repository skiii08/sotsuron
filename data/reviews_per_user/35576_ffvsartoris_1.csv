Marie Antoinette," A WOPPER OF A FILM... if you like the taste of a suddenly rich Sicilian peasant writ large
","The critic who called it 'Gidget goes to Versailles' was on the right track.... if one wanted to immerse oneself in wretched excess... too many patterns, too many different textiles, too many shoes, too much food, the worst musical score since PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and connect it with a plot that just strung all the tableaux vivantes together in a train wreck... don't miss this.Add to it a very Jewy Louis XVI- Jason Schwartzman looked like he just stepped out of a Seinfeld episode, and could have been fine as a Jewish American Prince, but hardly a French king and Rip Torn playing Louis XV looked like one of her dad's mafia dons who showed up in the wrong film, and it was hilarious.It is true that Coppola did catch in Kirsten Dunst some of the Antonia Fraser she was aiming for... but Dunst's fine performance was like the lonely clam in the proverbial church social clam chowder, surrounded by 50 gallons of tasteless lukewarm swill.IF you want to see how inbred the film business is and how out of touch with their market, by all means see this. It is a lesson in media mafia gone mad.",1,3,4,1 November 2012
