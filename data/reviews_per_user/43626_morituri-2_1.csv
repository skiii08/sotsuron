Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas's Revenge--Howard the Jedi
","This is one of the more frustrating movies I have seen in a while.  There are parts of it I definitely want to see again--the pod race, the sword fight, the underwater city--but that would mean sitting through the rest of the boring movie.  The actors seem to merely be mouthing their lines. Moreover, as much as I thought it was frustrated former English majors-now critics who moaned about lack of character development, there really has to be some development, or there is no story.  You have to care at least a little to be moved when a character dies.  Here, when one of the characters dies, great yawn--Who cares??--and his lack luster performance made it seem probable that he threw the fight just to get out of the movie.",6,0,1,25 May 1999
