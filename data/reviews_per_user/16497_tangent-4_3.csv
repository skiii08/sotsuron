The Blair Witch Project," Creepy, Creepy Creepy!
","I just recently saw it, and loved it!  The movie was a bit of a slow start, but once it got going, it grabs you and doesn't let go!Be prepared to be creeped out!  But, if you are expecting another Scream, or I Know What You Did Last Summer (as most of the younger members of the audience seemed to be), you will be disappointed.  But if you are expecting a creepy horror film that is unsettling and will make you think, then this is the flick for you!",10,1,2,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Maybe not as good as ESB, but entertaining nonetheless.
","I felt that The Phantom Menace was entertaining.  I liked the idea of learning more background on the Star Wars universe.  This is coming from a person who HAS NOT read every novel/comic/ story etc. and am basing this solely on the movies.Eps IV-VI were an epic battle (Good vs Evil, overthrow the tyranny, rescue the princess, and so forth).  Ep I is all about Characterization and Backstory.  Of course it's not going to have the same feel!People should stop viewing it through the lens of ep IV-VI, and let the movie stand (or fall) on it's own points.I found the movie entertaining, although I believe JarJar could be less slapstick (and at least make him intelligble!), and I was disappointed with the presence (or lack thereof) of Darth Maul.  I was expecting him to be the Vader-type (until Anakin makes his debut of course), but only a few lines and a fight sequence doth not a villain make!Despite that, it was an entertaining watch, and am looking forward to Ep II!",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
The Fifth Element," Get out the XL Sledgehammer, boys!
","I personally liked this movie!Imagine a future where everyone is dressed by Gaulthier, and even effeminate black men can get an woman they want (there's hope yet!)I thought the sequences were great! (especially the Diva sequence)The only part I disliked was the 'W-A-R' sequence. (let's hammer the message home with an XL sledgehammer, shall we?)But seriously, you've got to love a movie where Gary Oldman is NOT playing the weirdest character!",Null,0,1,14 July 1999
