Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing
","Warning small spoilers may be contained........
After watching the movie....it ended 5 minutes ago I think I may still vomit.  The movie is amazing in scope and complexity.  However at it's core it is extremely disturbing.  It should be required viewing for any person who has ever contemplated using drugs, and is by far the best argument against legalization of drugs.  The movie cuts to the bone and then goes farther with a depth that will leave the viewer in disbelief. Parents....do not let your children see this movie, this is NOT a movie that is for kids.Dark and gritty, so real it hurts.  One of the best movies I have ever seen, and I am not sure I am able to ever watch it again.  That is how disturbing the movie is.",10,0,0,27 July 2001
