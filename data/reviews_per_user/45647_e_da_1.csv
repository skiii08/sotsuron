Marie Antoinette," Do NOT watch!
","If I could have selected 0/10, I'd have done it. The very opening titles should have warned me of what was coming. Currently, I'm considering suing the film makers for completely wasting thirty minutes of my life. This is the story of a legendary French queen retold by an American teenager whose relationship with history before the WW2 is ... lukewarm, at best. Costumes are fine. The acting is far from outstanding, but quite plausible in considered frame. However, it's the music, that fits the theme as a fist fits the eye socket, and that all is topped? Buried? by the logical and historical faults. If you want to see an entertaining, yet more historical movie about the period of 18th century, see Barry Lyndon.",1,5,8,24 March 2007
