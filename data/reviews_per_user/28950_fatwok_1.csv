Blade Runner 2049," no wonder it flopped at the box office
","no it didn't flopped because of run time, or its R rating, or competition, or luck. it flopped because it was simply a bad movie. none of the characters were able to elicit empathy or connect with the audience. it was just poor acting and directing. there were too many plot holes. the plot was simple. it could have been summed up in a sentence or 2. but it stretched to almost 3 hours. when will they learn that being vague does not automatically convert to suspense. i suspect that most viewers coming out of this movie will be whispering to their friends not to waste their money and 3 hours of their life, rather wait for the video release to check out the expensive visuals. i did. and that, i think, is the reason that this movie flopped this weekend.",2,19,53,9 October 2017
