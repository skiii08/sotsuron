The Blair Witch Project," Overrated, but it needed to be made
","All right, very very briefly:It's overrated (it's not really scary at all, except for the last five minutes, when it really comes alive). But it needed to be made, because it's broken the mould of horror film-making. It shows some intelligence, and the film-makers have reaped the reward of their courage. As an experiment, it's first class. But if you want to be scared, go see Sixth Sense or rent The Exorcist or The Shining...or better still, come to London and go and see the play 'The Woman in Black'. Now that really IS frightening.Mind you, I saw BWP in Sweden, with irritating Swedish subtitles, and a restless audience. And my girlfriend hated it. Not ideal circumstances. Shame, really. Walk in the woods, anyone?",7,0,1,6 November 1999
Casablanca," The best
","There are so many reasons why this is the greatest movie ever made. Here are some of my main reasons:1. There is not one single poor performance.2. The film surpasses a mere love story. It contains some splendid jokes, political intrigue, acts of war, corrupt officials, black marketeering, violence, and moral courage.3. As for that love story, can you think of any more mature exposition in movie history of the classic love triangle? The dynamics between Rick, Ilsa and Viktor are perfectly judged: Rick wants to hurt the woman who left him for what he sees as an inferior man (but whom he secretly admires); Ilsa is torn between her duties as a wife and the partner of an international hero, and the genuine passion she feels for Rick; Viktor knows exactly what his wife is feeling, but finds it easier to be a martyr, because he thinks that's his duty.4. The photography is terrific (example: when Rick opens the safe to get the money out just before Major Strasse arrive - we see only his shadow on the world, dwarfing Claude Rains).5. The music is wonderful, and has proved hugely durable.There are about 100 other reasons to admire this film, but these will do for now.",10,0,0,8 October 1998
Fight Club," Scorching
","As with so many other big films, there are too many comments for mine not to be lost in the mass, so I'll try to be brief.The film contains many platitudes about self-realisation, all of which we've heard before, but it sites them in a context so raw and vivid that they emerge fresh, and thereby communicate themselves to the viewer so directly that they become more powerful, more compulsive. If the film finally runs out of steam - because once you're on the destructive rollercoaster, you can't stop until it crashes - its early sequences provide a hard-hitting (no pun intended) and yet stylish approach to the vacuity of modern life (I particularly like the deconstruction of Ikea, as the proud owner of an Ikea futon).I wrote a novel last year in which the main character, frustrated with the emptiness of his life, is drawn by a somewhat insane other character into more and more extreme behaviour. Having seen Fight Club, I can safely tear up my manuscript, because Fincher and Uhls have conveyed the same message much more powerfully than I was able to.Fincher's direction may suffer from occasional gimmickry, but even the most apparently gratuitous moments are not without purpose. And Uhls's script is beautifully constructed. This is one of those rare films in which the voice-over technique really works.Ultimately, this movie is about subversion - not just against social norms, not just against the bourgeois mindset, but even against cinema itself (as shown by the overt subliminal imagery). It's so good to come across something so genuinely radical, with the cinema now over a hundred years old. Good, too, that it came out of a major studio. And good, let's not forget, that this film is extremely funny.Come on, hit me, you know you want to...",Null,0,1,14 November 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Tremendous fun
","The word 'romp' springs easily to mind, but this time it's highly appropriate. The script is beautifully witty and full of in-jokes without ever being pretentious. True, the film takes a while to find its feet and the historical inaccuracies are still too many to count, but so what? Fiennes has finally come of age and looks in danger of supplanting his elder brother (who badly needs another hit); Paltrow is radiant; and Rush does a surprisingly convincing comic turn. For me, the real surprise was Affleck, whose accent was not too unconvincing, and whose portrayal of a luvvie was as accurate as any today.Oscars will follow, I'm sure. 9 out of 10 (one point docked for the unevenness in the first half hour). I'll go to see this one again.PS Odd how, although this has been cited as a great British success, it was made largely with American money. Plus ca change...",9,0,0,1 February 1999
American Beauty," Beautiful and compelling
","I know this is comment no. 940, but what the hell.American Beauty is in some ways the antithesis of the equally brilliant Fight Club. Both concern men with their best years behind them, stuck in meaningless, middle-class jobs, who embrace extreme behaviour in an attempt to recapture meaning in their lives, with fatal consequences. Fight Club is the more dangerous, more radical and ultimately more nihilistic side of the coin. American Beauty is on safer territory, but its ultimate vision of the beauty of life is more affirmative and uplifting. Both films are masterpieces in their individual ways, but it says something about Hollywood that American Beauty will probably win the Oscar, whereas Fight Club probably won't even be nominated.On top of this, one can only marvel at the performances, at Thomas Newman's wonderful and memorable score, at Conrad Hall's glowing photography, at the poised and profound script, and at Mendes's loving direction, his debt to theatre immediately obvious. The plastic bag sequence had me in tears. If a film leaves me feeling, as Ricky puts it, that God has looked straight at you, then I give it a 10, whatever its flaws. Like Good Will Hunting, this film transcends cinema and touches your life, without ever stirring your cynicism. For that reason alone, American Beauty is a triumph.",10,1,2,7 February 2000
Duck Soup," Top-class
","It narrowly beats A Night at the Opera as the best all-round Marx Bros film, though I find the humour more bizarre in Monkey Business. At least the musical numbers in DS are actually worth sitting through.The reasons it scores so highly are:1) The mirror sequence. The finest comic sequence ever committed to film. Sure, it's old-hat vaudeville, but it's professional, beautifully timed and spirals into wonderful absurdity.2) The one-liners, puns and other jokes. Pick of the crop are the peanut stall interchange, the telephone sequence, the riddles ('what has four pairs of pants, lives in Philadelphia, and it never rains but it pours?') and the final battle (especially the stock footage of monkeys and elephants running to save the army under siege - the kind of thing the Zucker Bros pinched for their comedies). Oh, yes, and the motorcycle routines.3) The satire on politics and warmongering. The Brothers simply deflate the pomposity of the whole deal.4) The fact that Zeppo is actually given something to do.Anybody who thinks the Farrelly brothers are the last word in comedy should be strapped to a chair and shown Marx Bros films over and over again, until they concede.",10,78,94,11 January 1999
Being John Malkovich," What is going on here?
","Is this a film - or an experience? Actually, what is it, and which planet did it come from? Subverting this (and several other art forms), Jonze's 'thing' - I can't call it a film - is so far out of left field, it's on a different pitch altogether. My girlfriend laughed like a drain, but I just sat open-jawed all the way through. What are we supposed to make of it? Does it matter? Jonze himself, when pressed on the film's meaning, shrugs and says 'I dunno'. Perhaps that's a good thing. BJM needs to stand on its own, without even the influence of its creator. Creator? Was this 'thing' created? Or did it just appear from some other dimension, warped into our own by some peculiar combination of cosmic elements? This sounds like a negative review, but I loved it. It's just hard to describe an experience which is unlike any other you've ever had. Leave your expectations at the door before seeing this one, because they'll only hinder you. If this is what 21st century cinema is going to be like, I want in. 10 out of 10, and full marks to the team behind it.Malkovich... Malkovich...",10,0,1,2 May 2000
Good Will Hunting," A slow burner, a fine achievement
","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10,520,570,17 March 1999
The Red Violin," Splendid
","This is art. Real art. So few films try for this much.My sadness is that its appeal will be limited to polyglots, musicians, and lovers of costume drama. It's worth so much more than that. Beautifully shot, sensitively scripted and acted, and cleverly executed, this deserves more awards and greater coverage than it's going to get.9 out of 10. I dock one point because Girard occasionally lets the pace drop to deadly, and because Jason Flemyng and Greta Scacchi irritated me beyond words - but that's not Girard's fault.",9,4,4,27 April 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," No, unfortunately
","Since there are already buckets of comments about EWS, I'll be brief:1) Hard to believe this really was the final cut. Scenes disappear into nowhere, the pace is sometimes deadly slow, and the whole structure looks indulgent, even by Kubrick's standards.2) Too much Cruise and not enough Kidman, who brings a tremendous virtuosity and depth to her limited part.3) As always with Stan, utterly brilliant use of Ligeti's music, which stopped me from hating the film altogether. Nice camerawork and lighting in places, too.4) Good bits: the row in the apartment (contains the best writing in an otherwise unworthy script); the orgy (though only for its style, not for its content); the moment when Cruise finds the mask; er... that's it.5) Why doesn't Sydney Pollack act more often? He's terrific!6) I don't have a problem with sex in movies, but here it was gratuitous and actually rather sad. One can, unfortunately, easily imagine Kubrick doing the editing using only one hand.7) The last line is predictable and stupid, and rather trivialises the whole thing.In short, EWS can't make up its mind whether it's a Hitchcockian thriller or a psychological study of sexual relations within a couple. If SK had stuck to the latter, it would probably have been a very good film. Unfortunately, despite flashes of his previous brilliance, this one doesn't work, and it's sad that this is the note he went out on. Still, at least Cruise nearly manages to act.",5,1,2,18 October 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," Quality
","It now looks pretty old hat, simply because we've now suffered an overdose of romcoms, all cast in the same mould (actually, all cast with the same cast, come to think of it). But this is the first and best of its kind by miles.Marrying Ephron's script with Reiner's light direction is where the film scores over its imitators, along with having Crystal and Ryan appear fresh and untainted by later failures. Ephron clearly used up all her best jokes here and in the first half of Sleepless in Seattle. WHMS really does have a smart line every minute, and not all of them from Crystal ('You made a woman miaow?').Whether the movie's assertion that men and women can't be friends is outside the scope of this criticism, though the ending suggests otherwise. And while using 'Auld Lang Syne' to underscore the climax stinks of imitation (Waterloo Bridge, anyone?) it still makes me cry every time.On the down side, this film has a lot to answer for. It gave rise to a stream of soppy joke-free 'comedies', all set in a large American city, with an easy listening soundtrack, a strong yet vulnerable male hero, a sassy yet vulnerable female hero, a couple of mad friends and a cameo from a well-known director (usually Reiner himself). Accept no substitutes - this is the 10 out of 10 original.",10,0,1,29 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Effectively chilling and intelligently made
","This is good stuff, but since there are already so many comments, I'll be brief:The direction is excellent - everyday buildings sprout monstrous gargoyles (I don't know if everyone spotted it, but there is a moment near the beginning where the skyscrapers in the background appear to have demonic, grinning faces); subdued or oblique lighting intensifies the air of menace; the shocks, few though they are, are impeccably timed.One should praise Tak Fujimoto and James Newton Howard for their excellent contributions.The performances are restrained, but not bland. Colette is at her finest, as usual. Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, one of the best child performances ever (note the bit in the church where, from the balcony, he talks to Willis with the weariness and sarcasm of a much-lived adult).THAT twist...well, it's reasonably unpredictable, but it's a shame it isn't really developed. In fact, the film seems to disappear into a blandness at the end which reminds you it was made in Hollywood - which is a shame, after so much good value along the way. And, as you think about the twist, you realise it's actually illogical. Oh, well, I'll say no more about it.Overall, the film will be compared to Blair Witch, though it doesn't resemble it much. What it's really like is a cross between The Shining (which is inferior) and The Innocents (which remains superior, because it is much more bitter and chilling). In fact, the appearance of the first ghost in Sixth Sense so closely resembles a moment in The Innocents, that I can't believe it's not been copied. Still, this is not really a criticism - this is fine, intelligent, thoughtful film-making, and how often does that come from a studio picture these days?",8,0,0,6 November 1999
The Matrix," Visual feast without much substance
","Felt a bit disappointed with this one. Bags of eye candy, certainly, but all the best bits were shoved into the trailer, so there weren't any big surprises. The moving freeze frames were quite nicely done, but I found the martial arts sequences quickly became boring.Whether the pretentious symbolism works or not doesn't really matter (Christ, Alice in Wonderland, etc. - hey, original, guys!), but given the amount of money spent on this film, couldn't they have come up with a better script? This screenplay is Cameron-awful. The best moment is the in-joke when Keanu does his 'woah!' Brought the house down when I watched it.The acting is pretty variable, too. We don't expect much from Keanu at the best of times, but to see an actor of Hugo Weaving's talent reduced to a snarling, stereotyped villain is saddening (and why does he talk so slowly - was he having trouble with the accent?). I suppose the Reservoir Dogs uniforms are quite fun.Easily the best bit is the sequence with the Oracle. Beautifully underplayed. If only the rest of the film had been this subtle. Admittedly, the break-in at the top security building has an energy and style which is impressive. And I will confess that charging down a corridor with two guns blazing in your fists, while wearing a dark coat and sunglasses, is pretty cool.(Those sunglasses were everywhere, weren't they? Even in dark rooms. Do these characters have a sight problem? Is that another piece of symbolism? Do I care enough?)I give it 7 out of 10, for the visuals, and for evidence of some intelligence at work. But, boys, when you come to do the sequel, do think a bit more about the dialogue, and stop pretending you're George Lucas, because he's not exactly the world's greatest screenwriter.",7,0,0,6 July 1999
Cube," Underrated
","'Cube' seems to have gone down better in the UK than at home, judging by the critics.I was impressed enough to see it twice, at consecutive screenings. It's an intelligent film - the concept isn't novel but the setting is (and let's put in a word for the terrific design of the cubes). Sure, the characters may be stereotypes but their interactions are not so predictable (you don't expect the leader to lose control and turn nasty, for example). Similarly, the dialogue sometimes leaves a lot to be desired (too much 'oh my God!' and 'of course!') - but how would you talk in the same situation?As to the 'why?' of it all, I don't see it as a cop-out, as some reviewers have suggested. The fact is, there IS no 'why', as Worth patiently explains. There IS no conspiracy, there IS no brain behind it - it's a big corporate mistake. Only those desperate for another X-Files Big Conspiracy Theory should be disappointed by this explanation.As for the characterisation, the film suffers (as does 'Seven') from not having enough time to develop its characters properly. But to do so would have generated even more talk, and would probably have got boring. Besides, nobody complained that we didn't really know who Mr Blond was in 'Reservoir Dogs'.'Cube' resembles 'Event Horizon' in its situation and the horror of its exposition - but where 'Event Horizon' just gave us a series of iconic figures to be dispatched in a 'Who's next?' exercise, 'Cube' bothers to give us more. I found myself caring about the characters, I responded positively to the structural approach, I admired the production design and I was regularly surprised. You can't ask for much more from a first feature, and I look forward to seeing Natali's future work.",8,1,2,28 September 1998
The Thin Red Line," Beautiful, mystical but slow
","TRl isn't an easy film. Mystical, shifting, perhaps unfocused, occasionally exciting, more often philosophical, it was a brave decision to make it this way.One should start by observing that the photography is superb (though, admittedly, it would be hard to make this landscape look dull), some of the performances are excellent (Chaplin, Koteas, Nolte), and Hans Zimmer's score is beautiful, seamlessly blending his own string arrangements with the works of Ives and Part.Malick's take on war as a soul-searching experience is rewarding, and makes a neat contrast to Spielberg's gung-ho approach. Nevertheless, I did find myself wanting him to get a move on at times; when the film seemed in need of some propulsion, Malick would stop for some slow-motion contemplation with voice-over, or another shot of an exotic bird. This makes the whole experience dreamy, but slow.The casting isn't always successful: Cusack looks out of place, and you'll miss Clooney's contribution if you blink. As for Caviezel, I found myself just wanting to smack him in the end.8 out of 10, then, for courage, for finesse, for novelty and for intelligence: this is a good film which exhibits all these qualities. But I found myself preferring Ryan - for its directness, for its technical achievement, and for its harrowing detail, which TRL cannot (and does not try to) match.",8,0,1,17 March 1999
Braveheart," One for the Nats
","Just snored my way through this one on TV.Gibson does everything right, but nothing original. So the battle scenes are quite well choreographed, but don't add anything to what we've seen before. And the editing is very fussy, so we don't get any feel for the sweep of the battlefield (perhaps they couldn't get enough extras...). Can't beat Oliver's Henry V on this onePerformances are quite hammy, though Gibson's Scottish accent is not too bad (unlike McFadyen, who really ought to be able to do a more convincing burr than this). McGoohan, an actor I normally respect, seems to think he's Basil Rathbone.The torture scenes must have been cut for the TV version, because they weren't particularly harrowing. The photography isn't bad - nice rolling green fields and misty moors - but you expect a bit more than that from an Oscar winner.Oh, of course, in real life Wallace never got anywhere near York, they didn't paint woad on their faces, Isabelle was only 13 when Wallace died, and Edward I outlived Wallace by a couple of years. Still, it's only a movie, eh?",Null,2,4,11 January 1999
