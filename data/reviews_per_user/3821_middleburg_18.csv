Vertigo," Ravishing
","What an extraordinary experience it is to see this movie in the cinema. Having scene the film as a youngster on an old black and white TV set sitting on a couch with a bunch of young cousins, we were all transfixed. I remembered the story line and the disorienting experience, and how captivated I was by the mystery story for years. I remember that we had to leave my aunt and uncle's home before the final twist of the film was revealed--and I made my aunt promise to watch the film and let me know how it ended. Well, she obviously didn't see the film, as I called her up when we got home, and she told me that the man and woman fell in love and the movie ended with them nice and happy!! So for 30 years, that's how I thought Vertigo ended. Then in the early 1980's I saw the film in its famous re-release as it was garnering its new found critical and commercial acclaim, in all its glorious color, with a New York City audience laughing and clapping and getting so amazingly caught up in this grand cinematic experience. It was, simply put, awesome!There are scenes in this film that are so unique, so surprising , that they genuinely take the breath away. The two shots of Madeleine, as a beautiful goddess-like figure in Ernie's restaurant, viewed from Scotty's perspective in the distance, then up-close as she glides by as if in a dream; the shot of Madeleine reappearing after Scottie's initially humorous, but then uncomfortably obsessive make-over, filmed in a glowing, hazy light, with Bernard Herrmann's ravishing film score welling up in waves of sonorous passion; the surprisingly long sequence without almost any dialog in which Scotty trails Madeleine, containing one gorgeous moment after another - the back-door opening up onto the kaleidoscopic colors of the flower shop, the mysterious silence in the grandeur of the museum; the gorgeous views of San Francisco - the monuments, the colors, the vistas; the truly dreamlike scene in the middle of the towering, dark redwoods; and that vision of the Golden Gate Bridge where Scotty 'saves' Madeleine - it took truly masterful film-making to take an iconic American image, and present it on screen in such a spectacular and unique manner. But the film is not merely a 'museum film' where art direction and cinematography are the most important element. In Vertigo, the story is a 'page turner'. We are watching each of the characters, absolutely fascinated with the twists and turns that abound. The engaging humor, the riveting suspense, the intriguing story line all stem from the manner in which Hitchcock presents the three main characters: - the physically and psychically crippled hero of James Stewart, the enigmatic, but unbelievably alluring heroine of Kim Novak, and the adorable, humorous, lively, human and humane Barbara Bel Geddes - we care deeply for all three of them, tangled in this complex spiral of inevitable sadness and tragedy. I loved the film having seen only 2/3rds of it as a kid, and I now know this film as a great and enduring piece of American Cinema, a true classic.",10,8,11,18 July 2006
Marie Antoinette," Visually stunning, surprisingly touching, and Cool with a capital C!
","This movie is the very essence of cool. Who in the world could make a two hour film that captures the incredible historical complexities of the French Revolution and the political intrigues of the court of Louis XVI? The reason that 'The Queen' works so well is that it focuses on that one week in the life of modern day Britain and the court of Elizabeth II. Truths are stated, complexities described, and the audience gets a real insight into the historical times and the personal stories being told. Try to portray years and years of British history, and the subject would be unwieldy and issues skirted over. Sophia Coppola goes for it, describing years and years in the life of an even more complex time. But she doesn't just do a historical survey. Leave that for the detailed books and college courses. For that is what it takes to come to terms with one of the greatest upheavals in history. Instead, she gives us an Impressionistic fable (worthy of being hung in the Louvre). Visually this is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. I have visited Versailles twice. It was spectacular and beautiful - but this is probably the first time in my experience where a movie is just as good (maybe even better!) than the real thing! Somehow it is MUCH more fun seeing Versailles with the people in their period costumes rather than with hundreds and hundreds of tourists. I predict that Sophia Coppola is going to become one of the great, even legendary film makers. She takes audacious risks. And she takes them successfully! I've seen the movie now twice. The first time, the juxtaposition of modern dialog and expressions with the 18th century milieu, and the modern music with the late Baroque/Classical was jarring. But before I knew it I was totally seduced by the wildness of these juxtapositions. The moment when I became absolutely knocked out by this film, was Marie Antoinette's first walk through the palace, with the endless bowing, and the children with their bouquet's looking like miniature Marie Antoinettes, and that vaguely Oriental music playing in the background. This was an exotic world - fascinating, dreamlike, and seductive.The result of all this craziness and wildness is a movie which is simply unforgettable. I find myself thinking back on those scenes - and I want to revisit this great Impressionistic canvas of a movie. Hedonistic - of course. But Versailles, in all its hedonism lives on, and will always live on. The movie could have become simply a guilty pleasure, or just a cool, hip statement - but it actually goes beyond that - it actually becomes touching, as we feel the ultimate pain of those baffled royals much in the way we were all sorry for the poor rich princess in 'Roman Holiday', or our own poor rich princess Diana. Total thanks for these surprisingly strong feelings comes from an extraordinary performance by Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. There isn't a frame of the movie that she appears in, in which her facial expressions don't speak volumes and volumes - expressions of joy, innocence, wisdom, callousness, and ultimately humanity.I give this movie a 10. Some will say the film is quirky, but I also predict that it will live on as one of the most fascinating films of recent years.",10,12,21,15 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," More than the Heart can bear
","Throughout art, there have been countless stories and books, plays and movies about unrequited love. Some of the greatest stories and greatest works of art are about this very subject. And Brokeback Mountain enters this Pantheon of enduring love stories told with heart and beauty. The contrasts in Ang Lee's film are almost painful to have to deal with. The beauty of the scenery - skies so blue as to be dazzling in their intensity, mountain landscapes that are breathtaking in their grandeur - contrast with the heartbreaking poignancy of this sad, sad tale. The film consists of layer upon layer upon layer of emotion and meaning. The backdrop is beautiful. The pathetic nature of the lives of characters we grow to care so much about during the course of the film, are sometimes painful to watch. But then in the middle of these tragic story lines, there are moments of beauty and peace appearing like flowers suddenly blooming in the desert - Ennis' loving and loved daughters, Jack's humor, the strength of Alma and Lureen desperately trying to make their marriages work, Ennis opening up of his true feelings. The audience watches this life journey and is profoundly touched. We think we know what direction the movie might take at several times during the film, but then like life itself, the film veers off unexpectedly as fate and circumstance suddenly appear and the characters are forced to continually deal with life in all of its complexity - complexity of feelings, of situations, of inevitability, of both happiness and tragedy. The ending is genuinely emotionally charged. The culminating scene between Jack and Ennis where anger gives way to heartbreaking declarations of helplessness, and ruefulness at wasted time and wasted lives is simply devastating. The final scene with Ennis toasting his lovely, precious daughter, followed by that unbelievably tender final tableaux of Ennis, tears flooding his eyes, gently adjusting the photo of Brokeback Mountain is one of the most powerful scenes in recent American Cinema. For the audience, it is a moment that is almost more than the heart can bear. This is a classic film, and it will long endure as one of the most touching and profound films exploring the deepest recesses of our hearts.",10,36,42,27 August 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Ruining a Broadway masterpiece
","Reasons this film is such a heartbreaking disappointment to those of us who consider Sondheim's musical one of the great triumphs of the Broadway stage: 1.The missing song: Can you imagine Oklahoma without 'O What a Beautiful Morning', or 'The King and I' without 'Shall We Dance?' or South Pacific without 'Bali Hai'? By eliminating the Ballad of Sweeney Todd which was a riveting opening number possessing both understated energy, going from the depths of ominous repetitive rhythms to the High penetrating falsettos of the tenors was a terrible miscalculation. Replacing it with just the opening introductory vamp is pointless. I noticed in the comments that so many people who did not know the show complained about the music. The genius of Sondheim's score is that it had a combination of clever songs, heart wrenching songs, lyrical passages - and a memorable, rhythmic driving song--the Ballad of Sweeney Todd -- which appears throughout the show -- at the beginning, the ending and several key spots in between. Without it, you've robbed the audience of a memorable tune -- and you've robbed them of rhythmic drive. No wonder their are complaints about the music! It's missing a key and crucial ingredient. 2. The casting. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are terrific actors - but not in this film. Oh how we miss the over-the-top outrageousness of Angela Landsbury's Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn's manic, desperate Sweeney Todd, and the more recent inspired interpretations by performers like the powerhouse Patti Lupone. Instead we get sour, dour often understated characters filled with pure bitterness and hatred -- robbing them of their humanity. On the stage, believe it or not, we could even identify with the characters. Here we could care less about them. 3. Where's the humor? By focusing only on the dark aspects of the show, there is no fun. The few more-light hearted moments are non-existent. The attempts at movie humor (the roaches in the 'worst Pies in London ' scene, the comic turn of Pirelli's crooked Italian barber, marred in the film by his so obviously beating and abusing Toby, makes the audience just feel uncomfortable. In 'Have a little Priest' both Depp and Carter hardly ever crack a smile - they just sing with bitter irony and almost no facial expressions. 4. Speaking about Toby, another huge miscalculation was making his character a child. In the Broadway show -- he is at the very least a teenager -- even in his 20s. With Toby now a youngster -- his story line becomes pathetic. In the original he was a perfect foil for Mrs. Lovett's and Sweeney Todd's gruesome antics. His revenge is satisfying on the stage. In the movie it is macabre. 5. The singing. Helena Bonham Carter's singing is so weak -- and has such poor diction, she sounds like a little girl without any vocal training. Johnny Depp's pop singing sound ('I will have vennnnnnnnngeance') is such a letdown after having heard some powerful operatically trained voices singing the role. 6. The violence. In the recent version of the Broadway Show with Lupone and company playing instruments in addition to acting (creating its own wonderfully imaginative, circus- like atmosphere)-there was no blood -- just red clothes And yet, when the violent actions of Sweeney Todd were shown on stage either realistically or symbolically, they were shocking - jolting. In the movie, the buckets of blood are not shocking -- we get immune to it. So the whole impact of a musical based on such macabre material is muted.Having said all of this -- one should note that the set decoration -- the scenes of a spectacularly grimy blue-gray London covered in soot and smoke and existing in nightmares is just fine. It's just too bad that such disservice was paid to the spirit of the musical -- what was remarkable, fresh, riveting and memorable is all lost. How sad!!",3,4,8,5 April 2008
Fargo," Darn Tootin'!!!
","'Fargo' has another character - that North Midwestern accent, with its Scandinavian lilt, its folksy charm and its disarming presence in practically every scene in the movie. This film is a hoot! I agree completely with Ebert's beautiful review. It is fascinating, heartfelt, true to character, place and situation, extremely funny, and sometimes painfully violent. I would only add that as an entertainment, it is one of the most disorienting experiences a viewer can find in the cinema. It is fascinating to watch this film back-to-back with the Coen Brothers' 'Blood Simple', a great film in its own right, but which seems like the preparation for their masterpiece, 'Fargo'. The tension is almost unrelieved in 'Blood Simple'. But the ending violence is so over-the-top, that the viewer suddenly realizes that they are really being sneakily had by the filmmakers and that the joke is on them. In 'Fargo', the tension is also unrelieved. But here the film starts with the audience being 'in' on the outrageousness of the events and the almost cartoon-like characters with their outrageous accents. But still we don't know sometimes whether to laugh or feel chilled (with the events AND that bleak Minnesota winter!) The audience experiences two strands of tension - the crime, and Jerry Lundegaard's exponentially growing nightmare. Who doesn't identify with the moment when in total exasperation at the unfolding of events, Jerry has that tantrum, trashing his desk. Granted we haven't all had our spouses kidnapped for money! But we are right there with Jerry, feeling his helplessness. What a tour-de-force of acting from William H. Macy, with France McDormand's human-wise Marge, and Steven Buscemi's SadSack crook creating and leading one of the greatest acting ensembles to grace an American film in years. The audience thinks from the very beginning, that that bizarre Steven Buscemi sure seems 'funny-lookin' in this movie. And when that phrase is uttered in two of the funniest moments of the film, we in the audience laugh, knowing the film-makers are actually making fun of us at these priceless moments. We may be 'in' on the jokes, but the film-maker's are absolutely onto us - and they have fun in letting us know that. Frances McDormand's Marge, with her genuine, caring persona, a smile that lights up the screen, and the most-musical of accents - absolutely nailing the rhythms and cadences of that beautifully distinctive speech (little-known outside that part of the United States until this film came along) is a revelation in this movie. It makes the audience want to see any film she has ever been in before!This is a movie that became an instant classic, plunging the viewer into an alternate universe of feelings, situations and characters that they identify with, are repulsed by, laugh at, and ultimately embrace. You betcha!!!",10,0,2,16 December 2006
The Killing Fields," Human Emotion in a world of Horror
","Seeing the film again some 20 years after its premiere, its harrowing realism, its intense and gut-wrenching scenes of violence and desperation, its incredible suspense and riveting tale of survival is as powerful and heartbreaking today-- perhaps even more so. We can only compare the experiences of the Cambodian nation and people with all the subsequent horror stories--whether in Rwanda or Bosnia or Iraq. The film has, at its core, an amazing story to tell. But notice how so many of the scenes are filled with images of all of the innocents caught up in the unfolding horror story. There are so many close-ups of the 'extras'--their faces filled with sorrow, or disbelief--or blankly staring out like masks of good and evil. The final closeup photos of young and old-- innocents caught up in the awesome and incomprehensible history of a tortured land are absolutely haunting. You sit through the movie and keep asking yourself--why, why, why does such cruelty exist on this earth. I recently visited Cambodia, and the breath-taking beauty of its culture and cultural history, the warmth and friendliness of its people makes the events of the late 20th century almost impossible to believe. And yet the events occurred. The film is emotionally overwhelming--and what gets the viewer through the harrowing scenes are those scenes of basic human decency. As there are endless scenes of violence in the film, there are equally as many scenes of human kindness and compassion--scenes of the love of family members, of the dedication of the doctors helping those who are almost beyond help, of the desperate concern of all of Dith Pran's colleagues vainly trying to help him and of the heartfelt friendship of Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg. Maybe basic human decency and those emotions of love and compassion is what is helping Cambodia recover, and will help all of the desperate people in this world caught up in war and conflict to eventually recover. Let's Hope!",10,0,2,1 August 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," We Are Family
","I love this movie! This rag tag family, beyond dysfunctional, is about an annoying group of people as one can ever hope to meet, let alone have to spend an hour and a half with them in a darkened movie theatre. But little by little they grow on you. Little by little you start to laugh at them, accept them, and then ultimately take them to your heart. Why? Beyond their quirkiness, beyond their ridiculous personalities, beyond the comic book situations they find themselves in is a tale of love and decency. And family! People who need people! (Sorry for the cliché - somehow it doesn't feel out of place in describing this movie!) During the roller coaster journey in that gradually deteriorating yellow bus, they fight, they bicker, they get on each other's nerves, but ultimately they embrace each other, with a knowing understanding that is deep and enduring. That yellow bus keeps trucking along, and that family with their deep, deep underlying bonds of love and genuine affection outwits all those people and life events gnawing at their lives, trying to crush them every step of the way. Gnaw away! It doesn't matter. They'll endure with those heads held high in defiance and pride. Between the almost vaudevillian moments that abound are scenes of such tenderness and real emotions, scenes which are really profound: the grandfather's hotel room bedtime chat with his beloved granddaughter, the way in which the uncle and brother get the young girl to eat her chocolate ice cream in the diner, the wordless hug the girl gives her devastated brother on the side of the road. Priceless moments, all! Annnnnnnd.....talk about funny! The final scene beats out Borat for the funniest scene of the year. It is set up so beautifully, and takes the audience by such surprise - I don't think I've heard belly laughs like that in a long, long time.....at least not since Borat! See this film - relax, enjoy, embrace....and love!",10,2,4,21 January 2007
Doctor Zhivago," A Grand and Elegant Entertainment
","David Lean's 'Doctor Zhivago' is a classic film, one that will live on as long as their are films.  There are scenes in this movie that will invariably becomeindelibly etched in the viewers imagination:  The opening funeral march through the vast Siberian landscape, the grandeur of the Czarist Russian palaces, the march of the revolutionaries through the Moscow boulevards, the train ridestraight out of Dante's Inferno, the Ice-covered interior of the Zhivago country estate (a truly magical moment in the film), the wealth of beauty captured in the cinematography of this film is astonishing.  Julie Christie's Lara is one of those great screen personas--she becomes a woman of such mysterious beauty.  Thefinal scene of Yuri's desperate attempt to reach her in the crowded SovietMoscow is heartbreaking.  And that music score!  The opening film credits with Jarre's genuinely beautiful music, complete with balalaikas sets the mood for this great, grand entertainment.  One of the best ever!",10,71,88,13 August 2004
The Shining," Mesmerizing
","I just watched the Shining again after not having seen it for several years. and what do you know? I got chills. It's a bizarre film, filled with off-kilter touches, but it sure is a Kubrick film--with genuinely haunting images. The melding together of all the various elements--Shelly Duval's unusual acting style, JackNicholson's,...well...Jack Nicholson persona, gorgeous cinematography withthat breathtaking opening and a classic 20th century film score adds up to areally nifty experience. Seen in context of Kubrick's other masterpieces--it is fascinating to see how he weaves his absolutely distinctive style andobsessions into this film. Seeing it in its first run years ago--I remember the audience getting a real jolt, simply by having the word 'Tuesday' appear on the screen. A wonderful moment! And the audience roared with laughter at that.But then there were moments such as the ending that you wished would giveyou one final scare a la 'Carrie' but instead just seems to end. This is not your average horror movie. The way the characters talk, and their sort of insipid dialogue feels sometimes mundane and even kind of ordinary. But then thosemesmerizing images take hold, and the very ordinariness of the dialogue makes the horror that much creepier. We know Kubrick calculated every single instant of his film--and this one is certainly no exception. With this film he remained a master manipulator, and a master artist.",7,0,1,25 November 2004
American Beauty," Amazing!
","American Beauty is a film of such richness, imagination and heart, that it lives in your memory long after the final mesmerizing scenes have faded from view. It is also an unbelievably unique experience. I know of no other film with the same intriguing, beguiling twists and turns--of scenes and surprises that sometimes take the breath away. There are moments in the film where the laughter is genuine, where the intense drama is almost unbearable, where dreamlike visions spark to life with such magic, we almost can't believe what we are seeing, and where tears flow freely with heartfelt understanding and identification with the characters. . And that brilliant color red--in scene after scene--we can almost smell those roses and recoil at the blood. The great film makers that filmed dream sequences--whether it is Fellini or Bergman or Hitchcock--are joined now by Sam Mendes. There are images and scenes and details in this movie destined for classical status: Angela in the bath of roses (what an image!), Ricky's beautiful heartbreaking film of the flying bag, the extraordinary use of music--whether the pop music from Lester's youth or the gorgeous, haunting Newman score which compliments the scenes so perfectly, Lester's scenes at work (who doesn't fantasize about speaking up the way he does?), the gorgeous, gorgeous meditation on the simple, beautiful images of his life passing before his eyes (bringing to mind Wilder's 'Our Town' soliloquy that Emily gives detailing the simple, tender, but oh-so-meaningful moments in life, that make life worth living), the emotional roller-coaster, and off-kilter experience the viewer has as Angela and Lester's final scene goes from genuine eroticism, to tenderness, to wistfulness, to wise and profound understanding. On so many levels this film is one of the great cinematic experiences--as a work of art it can be studied and seen over and over again for myriad details, and as a work of the heart--it can be cherished.",10,1,2,25 August 2005
Dog Day Afternoon," Mesmerizing and Pacino and Cazale Rock!
","What a great film. Where to begin? The opening Elton John music--perfect to help set the mood, which is the only time there is 'background music' so that the effect is like watching a real-time documentary with hidden cameras. Theacting--what acting?? The characters all feel so real and so perfectly drawn from the tour de force of Pacino's Sonny to the unbelievably intriguing Cazale's Sal (what a tragic, tragic shame that his acting career was cut short--but he sure left us with some of the most memorable characters in the history of American Film) to all of the 'bit' players, each a living breathing recognizable person. The New York feel to the film is perfect. The directing of Lumet is just astonishing. As has been commented on--we feel that we are experiencing each and everymoment of this hostage scenario--to the extent that by the end of it we are also exhausted, hungry and sort of in an altered state. Much of the film is like a roller-coaster ride--we do a lot of laughing, and watch the story unfold inamazement--and then that look on Sonny's face in the airport , filled with so much anguish, that the film also becomes incredibly poignant. Have a great,rollicking time--and see this absolutely top-notch film.",10,1,2,18 October 2004
The Graduate," Few Things in Life are Perfect--Well, this film is Perfect!
","Priceless Details in this film: 1. The sultry sound of Anne Bancroft's voice 2. The beauty of Katherine Ross 3. Benjamin trying to ge a room in the Hotel 4. Benjamin's mother's scream of glee at Benjamin's 'wedding announcement'5. Benjamin running toward the camera 6. Every second of the Simon and Garfunkle score 7. The fadeout on Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman right after Elaine finds out 'the truth'. 8. The Hotel staff all greeting Benjamin in front of Elaine capped off with the elderly lady's greeting. 9. That final enigmatic scene in the bus 10. Mike Nichol's intriguing closeup shots all the way through the film 11. The toaster popping up at the end of the 'engagement announcement'scene. 12. The first kiss between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson.I could go on and on...............This is one of the best films ever. Pureentertainment, classy, hip, sophisticated, gorgeous to look at and to listen to. Yep--it's perfect!",10,17,34,19 December 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's Masterpiece
","In a film career distinguished by films of great style, this one is Kubrick's most brilliant, entertaining, and beautifully conceived. There is not a moment which feels dull or forced or unimaginative. Of course Kubrick had a great piece of literature to deal with. People may quibble with his 'retelling' of 'Lolita' or 'The Shining'--I don;t--but this film is so completely true to the spirit of the book, and so beautifully finds a cinematic equivalent of the writing style of the original--that it is truly amazing how he pulled it off. The moment the film begins--with that unbelievably spectacular film score using electronic versions of one famouspiece after another and the vision of that Korova Milk Bar that began, what in the 70's was a really shocking film, we are tossed into a world so vivid and soimaginative. The moments of violence were practically unwatchable when it first came out (now of course we are desensitized to that........hmmmmmmm...wasthis film somehow prophetic?). But these horrific scenes were balanced withmoments that were simply beautiful or really amusing or intriguing as could be. In addition to being an extremely 'artistic' film, it also tells such a great and compelling story, and we get carried away with it. We somehow identify withAlex. We are appalled and we feel guilty at the end as we hear those final ironic strains of 'Singing in the Rain', and are so relieved that Alex is well and good-- that miserable rat bastard! How can this be? Kubrick has a field daymanipulating all of us. I think of any film I have ever seen (and I am a real film buff), this work made me think like none other.",10,0,2,25 November 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Fantasy, Heart, Guts and Magic
","One of the great film experiences of all time! At its premiere in the 1970s, we were stunned. Never before had we seen the inside of psychiatric institutions portrayed with such utter realism. It was frightening and disturbing, and so very bizarre. But, before you knew it, we were suddenly on a fantasy journey as McMurphy watches his phantom baseball games, gets the better of the horrid Nurse Ratched, commandeers that bus for that thrilling boat ride, teaches the Chief to play basketball with hysterically funny results (that scene of Will Sampson bounding down the court so absurdly gracefully created the first big belly laughs in the theater), and we were SO taken with McMurphy and his wonderful wisdom. Oh, but then that dramatically riveting ending, with Nurse Ratched's cruelty and then Billy Bibbit's harrowing suicide--we were now breathless with despair. The way Milos Forman so completely switched emotional gears was devastating. The bizarre made the fun all the more appreciated--the fun made the searing drama all the more painful. But then the final scene of sacrifice and resurrection with the Chief's heartbreaking embrace of the defeated McMurphy, and his escape to a magical freedom made our hearts break, and for more than a few, tears flowed freely. What an amazing artistic achievement. Certainly deserving of its awards, accolades, fame and its place in the pantheon of great cinematic achievements. I enjoy Ebert's criticisms, and usually find his reviews right on the money--but I sure disagree with his take on this film. In commenting on films like the great 'Field of Dreams', he talks about how the magic and non-realism contributes to its artistry and cinematic magic. But with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', he complains about the moments where drama and unreality interfere with the realism. That's missing the point of the film. The film is about human emotion and the great questions of life--of right and wrong--and the director and actors use a surrealistic world and atmosphere (dreams and day to day reality intertwined) to comment on feelings and emotions so complex, so unreal--so beyond our abilities to understand and comprehend. Magic is what this film is about.One last thing--I have long felt that this film has an additional element--that it can be viewed as a symbol of the Christ story in Christianity--where McMurphy represents the Christ figure. I certainly don't mean to be blasphemous about this. But--there is McMurphy and his disciples in the Institution. He teaches them--he creates magic for them. No--he doesn't turn water into wine, or one loaf into a hundred--but he has them watching TV when there is no picture on the tube! He takes them on a fishing excursion, and low and behold, they catch fish! He doesn't bring a dead man back to life--but he teaches Billy Bibbit to speak without stuttering. He could have escaped the institution, but he remains behind with his disciples. Note the extended (almost uncomfortably long) scene of McMurphy's face, as he fights with his demons in silence before he remains behind in the institution. There is no 'last supper'. But...well....there's a 'last bacchanal'! As Judas betrays Christ, there we have Billy Bibbitt wrenchingly betraying McMurphy. At the coda of the film, we actually feel uplift, seeing how McMurphy's spirit lives on with the Chief running out into the world, probably taking that message of decency and righteousness and the possibilities of life with him! I think this is more than coincidence in the construction of the play and the movie. I compare it to Cool Hand Luke. Same symbolic idea. I'm sure!!!However you view the film and its extraordinary impact, you will be mesmerized, entertained and deeply affected. Its cinematic art of the highest order!",10,3,7,9 August 2005
The Queen," Tears for a beloved princess and an all-too-human queen
","The Queen is riveting. It is no simple film, but rather an absolutely fascinating glimpse behind closed doors: the massive closed doors shielding the British Royal Family in their opulent cocoon, the rather more plain doors of the media-driven British government and its movers and shakers, and the doors too often hiding or protecting all of us from the pain of real feelings, real emotions. But then these doors come tumbling down during that awful, shocking week, as visceral now as it was 10 years ago. The political manoeuvrings, the confusion about how to handle such an extraordinary public and private tragedy in the midst of an astonishing, but not necessarily surprising outpouring of national, indeed international grief is shown with razor sharp brilliance. It is a movie that is simply unforgettable. One can view the film from an historical perspective, and be completely intrigued at the way the events unfolded. But what makes the film so powerful are the emotions that one experiences. We remember the sadness of that week, and we get teary-eyed seeing the collective grief of the country one more time on the television screen. That beautiful, complex, extraordinary Diana - without realizing it was part of our dreams of 'happily ever after'. When there was no 'happily ever after' - just the awesome finality of death, we cried - for her and also for ourselves. But in an amazing portrayal of the Queen in this movie, we now look at that week through Her eyes - not Diana's, not ours. Helen Mirren's performance is so unique, so exquisite, that we can't believe she's acting. She is a real person - regal, beautiful, elegant, down-to-earth, eccentric - a full human being. But as the turn of events unfold, her pain now becomes our pain - a pain that we didn't even realize was there. But of course it had to have been there! This movie makes us see that. When she almost becomes a little girl again, and calls out 'Mummy' to the Queen Mother, seeking out her advice, desperate to be comforted, our hearts break. She is even more vulnerable than one could ever have imagined. At the end of the movie, everyone has been transformed - those historical characters are moving on as both duty and the human spirit dictates it must, but we have been transformed as well. We have cried all over again, but this time with a little more insight, a little more understanding and a little more wisdom.",10,1,2,13 June 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," The sociological ramifications of Slumdog Millionaire in the United States
","Slumdog Millionaire, in addition to being one of the most perfect films I have ever seen, has some very real sociological ramifications in the U.S. Ever since 9/11, there has been a feeling of being uncomfortable around those people with brown skin--from the Middle East, from the sub-Continent, indeed even from Latin America. I would say that Slumdog Millionaire is the first major award-winning film introducing to the audiences here in the U.S. a main character who is Muslim. (I'm trying to think of another movie--but I can't--the main character in Lawrence of Arabia was English--although most of the supporting roles were Muslim--but that's as close as it comes.) The audiences here are seeing Dev Patel--and are identifying with him, cheering him on, hoping he 'gets the girl' (in addition to the money!) He is a person, a human being--and America is embracing his character. I know this seems like a real exaggeration--but I think it is not all that far-fetched-- to say that in the same year that we elect a half-African American president, we will be giving an Oscar to a film that celebrates the joys and life of a brown-skinned character from the sub- continent, and a Muslim at that. I never thought I would ever see either in my lifetime--but in one fell swoop, it has happened within the same year. Wow! There is hope--maybe there is destiny--that decency, human understanding and compassion will prevail--we are taught this by a big-eared president, and a big-eared lead character in a commercial movie!! All the nay sayers about this film should be ignored--completely! It is not 'Poverty Porn', it is not prejudicial or judgmental with regard to the country of India. It is not a contrived film, who's sole purpose is to provide manipulative entertainment. Yes--it uses an old-- fashioned, rags-to-riches, boy meets girl-boy loses girl-boy gets girl, where there are good guys and bad guys. This is a story with characters as old as the earliest Greek tragedies, and theatrical presentations from around the world and in cultures in every corner of every continent. But what makes this movie stand out is its glorious beauty, it's rich characterizations, it's basic human morality, it's mind-boggling artistry--I've seen the movie now 3 times--and each time I notice new wonderful details in terms of story line, pure film- making, and structure. This is a classic for the ages--that will live on as long as there are films being shown! And above and beyond the film--is that in having the audience celebrating decency and love and hope and belief in all the possibilities of life--they are forging an understanding of a culture and a people who are no different than any other people--and in so doing, it is creating enduring human bonds and enduring human understanding--this is no small achievement!",10,2,5,14 February 2009
The Birds," 'Why are they doing this.....the Birds?'
","Each time I see 'The Birds' I am enthralled. And yet each time I get annoyed. I am one of those viewers duly recognizing the eternal genius of Hitchcock--and The Birds is right up there with the best of his films. For film magic to really take effect--one of course has to suspend disbelief. And while there are moments that I quibble with in each of his films in terms of common sense or in terms of the way people would really talk or react in the given situations--with 'The Birds' there are so many more of those moments. OK--here goes:What I love about 'The Birds' 1. that famous scene of the birds circling down from the heavens over the burning gas station. 2. The great schoolyard scene--what a visual jolt the first time both Melanie Daniels and the viewer sees the full scope of the perched birds. (In that scene I even like that dumb song the kids are singing--I could sing it right now!!) 3. At the end of the scene where the family, in their own household cage, are surrounded by the frightening sounds of the bird attacks, and each character comes into view with the camera down below looking up at their eerily lit and haunted visage. Disorienting and Intriguing as could be. 4. The variety of the bird attacks--no two are the same--each one grows in intensity--and is so singular. One doesn't really prepare the viewer for the next one. 5. The electronic score. Mesmerizing--right from the word 'Go'! 6. That well-needed moment of repose in the seaside diner with the assorted town characters all chattering away. We're in the middle of a cataclysm, in the middle of our roller-coaster ride, but we enjoy the humor, irony, and sort of comfort of these people all gathered together. (We would not want to be alone during an attack like this--we crave human contact.) 7. The beautiful visuals--whether of the ride up the coastal highway, or the curving Bodega Bay, or the School's majestic position on the hill. 8. The final, eerie landscape of the birds in closeup around the house--to an infinite distance. 9. The intriguing ending--leaving it all up to our imagination as to 'what happens'--and making us want to see the film all over again to search for clues to what indeed happens. 10. Hitchcock's genuinely funny appearance at the beginning walking out the store with his two funny white dogs. Incongruous and adorable.What I find annoying about 'The Birds' 1. I'm sorry-- I know, I know--the opening helps set the mood, and there is lots of symbolism, and lots of Red Herrings as to where the plot might go--but it is still too damn long before anything 'good' happens! 2. Some of the acting is just execrable. Tippi Hedron is beautiful--but that voice!! 3. The whiny kids! They had me rooting for the birds sometimes. 4. Why does Melanie leave the diner for the phone booth? Oh--the visuals in the phone booth are spectacular. But why did she do that? 5. Why does Mitch spend ALL that time hammering wooden boards onto the outside windows of his house, when he should have just taken his family and gotten the Heck out of there? (Of course that would have deprived us of some additional spectacular scenes.) But it just seems silly what he is doing. 6. The sound of Cathy throwing up. (As she delicately coughs a couple of times. If you listen really hard--you do hear the sound of a bit of a 'throw-up sound'--but that may be wishful thinking! I say its just coughing!!) 7. Lydia's character. What an annoying human being. 8. Mitch's opening nastiness to Melanie. Melanie has to have real co- dependency issues to be drawn to him after that unpleasant exchange! I didn't buy it. 9. Some awkward camera shots--when the car explodes in flames, there are three frozen scenes of Teppi Hedron looking from her right to her left--it looks sort of silly. Also, the cook at the end of this scene suddenly runs in saying that the birds are leaving after everyone has already accepted that fact. It comes out inadvertently funny. 10. Cathy's immortal line: 'Why are they doing this....the birds?' It's a classic and a great movie, and who knows? Maybe some of the 'lesser moments' adds to its classic, unforgettable reputation. I've seen this film more times than I can count--and if it were on tonight--I'd watch it again!",8,0,0,31 October 2005
The Godfather," Perfect
","Yes--this is the great American film. It is a work of art from the vision of a brilliant director who synthesized his amazing knowledge of world cinema with acompletely American persona--mob story, love story, suspense story--and gottogether the greatest actors of the time to create a work of such power andbrilliance that it has deservedly taken its place among the great artisticachievements of all time. Everything came together so perfectly in this film. Seeing it in its opening week in 1972 (at a midnight showing since all of the other times were sold out--unusual at the time), we simply could not believe how the 3 hours flew by so fast. It was a breath-taking experience. It was sointriguing, so riveting. From the opening wedding scene straight through to that door closing in Diane Keaton's face--we sat there in amazement. And in thenumerous times I've seen the film since--it has retained its punch and itsmarvelous power to entertain and engage.",10,0,2,18 October 2004
