The Avengers," Avengers a 'no no'
","Folks...In case you're interested in the new 'Avengers' movie, don't waste your time or money. Unlike the first installment, this has nothing but special effects with a disjointed storyline. There are explosions in which most caught in the blast radius would get killed, but leaves nothing but scratches and little or no blood. It's almost stupid, with lines that are supposed to be funny, but are just 'fill-ins' for lack of meaningful dialog. However, the kids in the audience laughed a lot, which made me realize how out of place I was and need to grow up. There will be no next time if there is yet another sequel. Yuck. How disappointing.",1,7,31,12 May 2015
Life of Pi," you get lost in the vast spectacle of it all!
","This movie took me by surprise. I thought it was just about a young boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive on a small boat. But it was much more than that, for it conjured up thoughts, spiritually, visually, and intellectually. The actors were amazing and so, the Director Ang Lee. If you do see it, try and catch the 3D showing featuring the largest BTX screen/ multi-channel surround sound. I'm positive it would still be satisfying without those perks, but you will enjoy it much, much, more because it brings you into the location physically. I almost got seasick watching it because the huge screen was so, all encompassing. This movie features an all-Indian cast with acting skills displayed beyond the norm. Everything was so natural, as if no script was ever written. Spontaneity abounded throughout the film. The only negative: the theater turned up the sound too loud.",10,11,21,22 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," perfectly cast actors - superb!
","Casting director hit gold with choice of actors. Can't imagine anyone else playing their respective roles more perfectly. Especially Jennifer L. who never looks like she's acting. Conveying deep emotional expressions naturally, (which you just can't teach in acting school), she may very well covet an Oscar for her performance. Ditto for Brad C. and supporting actors. The dancing sequence was a bit too short for me. Now I want to see Jen in 'Dancing with the Stars' because she really IS a star! I'm sick of these, 'WHO? WHA? never heard of them' celebs. Perfect match for MAX C. with her tall 5'9' frame. And whadda figure!!! Barely a comedy as most posted. Deeper than the 'I' meets so to speak. The football dialogue confused me. However, it's a football lover's paradise if you're into that 'odds' banter. Great movie! Will buy Bluray ASAP when it hits stores.",10,2,6,27 December 2012
Prometheus," contains spoilers and not so kind words
","Yikes! I bought the 3D Bluray for beautiful Charlize Theron, having enjoyed her in 'Aeonflux'. But this story was nothing but another version of the 'Alien' and 'Species' trilogies. The script was simply horrendous and disjointed! There was no need for language, especially amongst the 'professionals' and crew members. It just made everyone look and sound like a bunch of misfits. Especially with untoward panic and temper tantrums. 'I'm just making this movie because this economy sucks and I need to pay some bills.' So, if you can't act, you're hired! When Ridley Scott makes a bad movie, you KNOW this economy is affecting ALL alien formsÂ…even the illegal ones! 'Hey meester, you want my seester? Everything said in other reviews thus far, mirrors my sentiments. So I'll just be redundant and say, this movie is STUPID, STUPID, STUPID! I want a refund!",1,4,6,24 November 2012
