Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," worst movie i have ever seen
","this movie was NOT funny... not even as the pseudo-comedy it is... the only people that might enjoy it are the retards that enjoy the Jackass films... or people that enjoy the 'borat' character poking fun and making racist remarks at people of other cultures. Cohen got sued multiple times over this filming (with good reason as he used people for the film and at the time without their consent) also there is a 10 minute gay scene that might bother some of the 'puritans' Sure, this film won a golden globe, but look at the films that won a golden globe... 90% of them were horrible films, and those awards are a huge joke. Borat (the film, and character) are about as funny as getting poked in the big toe with a cockroach... a true literal metaphor... I'm just surprised it didn't get put on the list of 100 worst films of all time.",1,1,3,13 April 2014
