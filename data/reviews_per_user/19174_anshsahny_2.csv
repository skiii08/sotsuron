Skyfall," Amazing Film but Slow Too
","Skyfall is the 23rd Bond film. It was one of the most anticipated films of 2012. It was Amazing and did really good on the box office. But Skyfall isn't 'that' amazing film we expected. There were lot's of mistakes. You see Daniel Craig different then ever from his normal roles as Bond but he brings something special into his role thus making it watchable. I am not saying Skyfall is bad but it wasn't perfect. It is a good film and is very fun with lot's of good action and delightful performances. The Direction Sam Mendes took on this movie was just wonderful. We got lot's of facts about Bond in this movie. Javier Bardem is an amazing Bond Villain and excels his performance throughout the movie. Judi Dench gives a splendid performance as well. But one think that made me wanted more was the pace of this movie. It could have went a lot faster like Casino Royale but still, Skyfall is is mostly a fun, entertaining movie.On The Whole, SKYFALL is truly a amazing film but the pace of the movie could have been faster. The Performances are one thing look at especially Javier Bardem. Its a fun movie. Go with a little high expectations and your day wouldn't be bad. Check out Skyfall.",8,3,8,17 February 2013
Django Unchained," Quentin Strikes Again
","In a Quentin Tarantino movie, you expect action, humor, acting and a huge load of blood. In Django Unchained, he does it the right way. Django Unchained is one of the most sleek and the most westernized movie I have seen. Its packed with an amazing story wrapped with brilliant acting. The Screenplay is Original and it is amazing. The dialogues are smart and witty. Django Unchained has Great performance packed actors. Jamie Foxx who plays Django is truly nice in this movie as he is playing a hard role. Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie is amazing and delivers a hard- hitting performance. Kerry Washington is good too but the stand out performance goes to Christoph Waltz who is the most funniest and historic one out of all. He delivers a Oscar worthy supporting actor performance.On the whole, DJANGO UNCHAINED, is a delightful movie which will make you surprised and not disappointed. Watch the movie for the performances and you will enjoy the movie throughout",9,1,3,19 February 2013
