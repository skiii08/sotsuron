The Longest Yard," Total RipOff of from the movie Mean Machine (2001)
","This is the worst ripoff I've ever seen, it follows the movie Mean Machine into exact details, the only real difference is that its American football instead of soccer. The story is 98% the same. They even got the same name on the inmate team, I got really sad when I saw this since I'm a big fan of the original movie. I'm sorry to say this but it 'sucked big time', the script is rewritten a little so it's supposed to look different but they did a really bad work at it, if it was a remake maybe I could have accepted it, but sadly I got only one thing to say to all people who has not seen this movie yet !!! AVOID CONTACT AT ALL COSTS !!! see the real movie, and if you've seen this already, see Mean Machine as well, then you will understand what I'm talking about.",1,2,3,7 February 2006
