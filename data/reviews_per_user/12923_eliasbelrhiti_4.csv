Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious from start to end
","After hearing reviews about how funnny this movie, I could not agree more it is really true what others say about how funny this movie is, I laughed a lot in this film, I don't think I spent 2 whole minutes without laughing, I even laughed at appalling moments including the nude fight between Borat and Azamat. Although I could criticize about its appalling graphics or its use of inappropriate jokes. But honestly this makes the movie a hell of a lot funnier. Sacha Baron Cohen does a fantastic job at playing Borat and making the character and the whole movie absolutely hilarious. I recommend this movie to everybody if they just want to laugh out loud, however you do need to know a little bit about the context of the movie. One thing for sure is that I will at some point buy a Borat suit.",8,2,2,21 May 2020
Forrest Gump," The movie that defines the 1990s.
","Forrest Gump is a film that documents Forrest Gump's life and all the adversities he has faced in his life including being bullied in school due to his mobility, and being found with an IQ of 75, however this does not stop Forrest to do great things including geting in the All-American football and ping pong team, getting a medal of honor for his military service, to running a successful shrimp business and meeting 3 US Presidents.I love the characters of Forrest Gump, Lieutenant Dan and Jenny Curan both have diverse backgrounds which deifines their personality. In my opinion, my favorite character is Jenny, because of her complexity as character and the difficulty to fully understand her decisions that she makes including leaving Forrest after he was awarded the medal of Honor and being defended by him from one of her hippie friends.The cinematography and editing of this film is absolutely fantastic and surely deserved the Oscar of 'Best Film Editing', the movie is very well polished imagewise. Not to mention how great of job the filmmakers did to remove Lieutenant Dan's legs using CGI and of course incorporating Tom Hanks into archive footage of JFK, LBJ, Nixon and the Dick Cavett interview of John Lennon, when the archive footage scenes appears, it is almost impossible to realize that this was edited and that Hanks was originally not in the archival footage, I mean that's how it was when I first watched it.Another note, is the story and plot, I was blown away by how Forrest Gump was easily incorporated into the real world and has even shown to give people some ideas about how to take off their career, including Elvis Presley with the 'Hound Dog' dance moves which in the movie seems that he has gotten the movies from Gump, or Gump first witnessing the Watergate scandal leading Nixon to resign and him and Lieutenant Dan's investments they make into Apple.Also, throughout the film has many emotionally touching moments, including when Forrest first meets Jenny and how they quickly become friends, Bubba and Gump's mother's death, Jenny suffering a breakdown after attempting to commit suicide while high and every single Jenny and Forrest reunions but in my opinion the two scenes which were the most heartreaking and touching scenes were first of all when Forrest was rejected by many of his peers on his first day on the bus and his description of the first time he met Jenny and his friendship with when children, another very heartbreaking and teary moment was of course Jenny's death and Gump's speech to her grave telling her that he misses her and that Forrest Jr. is doing just fine and wrote a letter to her which Forrest Sr. is not able to read.One thing that I obviously have to mention about this movie is the acting which was honestly fantastic and some of the best I have seen on a film. Especially Tom Hanks' acting and portrayal of Forrest Gump which in my opinion looks really natural it looks like he is actually Forrest Gump and he is not playing a role.Overall, Forrest Gump, for me is considered a classic and one of the greatest films I have ever watched. If you did not watch it yet. GO WATCH IT, you will not regret, and I do not think we will see a movie this phenomenal in quite some time.",10,0,0,3 May 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," A Masterpiece and still a masterpiece to this day
","Lawrence of Arabia is a historical drama film documenting the adventures of T.E. Lawrence fighting the Turks in the Arab Revolt during the First World War during 1916-1918 directed by David Lean. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars and won 7 of them at the 35th Academy Awards in 1963, which were the Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Art Direction.The David Lean film is wonderfully and beautifully put together and edited with an outstanding image and picture (NOTE: the film was restored in 1988 and 2012), I was also stunned that the movie instead of having a typical 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio which is mostly seen these days, it had an aspect ratio of 2.20 : 1 as the film's format was originally 70mm, in addition it gave the film a more cinematic feel and made the image of the film a much more panoramic look which I loved. Not only in my opinion was the film fantastically edited and put together but the soundtrack and original score of the film was outstanding and completely matches with the film.T.E. Lawrence is played by Peter O'Toole who delivers an outstanding and seamless performance through the entire 3 hours and 45 minutes of the film, other characters of the film including Prince Faisal who was played by Alec Guinness who also delivers an outstanding performance throughout the film.Although the film included some fictional characters including the Turkish officers who T.E Lawrence, the movie wonderfully documented the adventures of T.E. Lawrence In Arabia and bringing the Arab Tribes together despite the current differences and conflicts they had against each other and then fighting together against the Turks to capture parts of Arabia including Aqaba and Damascus.Overall, even though this film is surprisingly and overwhelmingly long, this film is nonetheless a masterpiece and considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and in my opinion one of the best classic films ever made, and honestly whoever rates this film lower than 9/10 should go see a doctor as this film is nearly perfect in every single aspect from editing to the story. If you have not seen this movie yet, you must go watch it, it truly is one of the greatest films ever made.",10,0,0,8 May 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Worst Spider-Man Movie
","I have seen quite a few of negative reviews about 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' and the Andrew Garfield franchise as a whole, so I had quite low expectations for the two movies. While the first movie was alright (5/10), this one was not good at all, the acting lost its authenticity, Garfield's performance in this movie is the most inauthentic Spider-Man performance I have seen. Other supporting actors such as Foxx and Stone were okay but did not do much to stand out. The plot is messy and I do not understand why 2 villains, Electro was suffifcent and the final battle was not really enternaining to watch. Some of the visual effects were alright in this movie, but other most prominent effects such as Electro and the Electric visual effects were not impressive and felt ripped-off from some other Marvel or Sci-Fi movie.Overall, I think I can deduce that this is the worst Spider-Man movie I have watched, it really dissapoints at all levels unfortunately. Messy plot, bad acting and crappy visual effects. Please do not watch, in fact do yourself a favor and avoid the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise, both the Tom Holland and the Tobey Maguire franchises are a hell of a lot better than this one in almost every way.",2,2,3,24 June 2020
