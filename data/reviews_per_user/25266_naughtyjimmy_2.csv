Skyfall," This is exactly how 21st century Bond/action movies should be made.
","**SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD** I don't often write movie reviews. But today, I feel compelled to.I was dismayed by the previous installment, Quantum of Solace, which was an obvious copycat of the Jason Bourne flicks. It was painful to watch with its shaky camera-work, stroboscopic editing and incomprehensible storyline (I had the feeling the producers decided the plot was something accessory). Actually, the same thing can be said of most action thrillers churned out by Hollywood nowadays: just one action scene after the other, without any plot, let alone any depth whatsoever; they're just disposable products for the average moviegoer more interested in eating his pop-corn or answering his cellphone during the screening than in following a storyline worthy of the name. Typical of the dumbing down of today's society.In stark contrast, Skyfall is the Bond movie I had been waiting for for ages. It stays true to the Bond mythos while daringly breaking new ground never seen before in Bond flicks. A more realistic plot drawing its roots in today's headlines. For the first time, a Bond flick has noticeable political thriller overtones. Settings remarkable for their lack of glamor, at least in the second half. A woman in her 70s as both 'the Bond girl' and a motherly figure to Bond. Smarter dialog with more depth, nevertheless with the odd typical Bond one-liner. Clever editing and beautiful photography, perhaps the most beautiful in the Bond series. Memorable performances, especially from Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes. Perhaps for the first time in the Bond franchise (with the notable exception of Timothy Dalton), the characters are fully-fleshed and NOT mere cardboard cutouts. I really hope we'll see in the next movie more of Fiennes' no-nonsense character, deft at playing power games in the corridors of high government (an ambiguous character reminiscent of the bad guys of Ken Loach's 'Hidden Agenda'). The relationship between Bond and M is also delved into with brilliance.As a longtime Bond fan who's always considered Timothy Dalton's rendering of Bond as the most hard-edged and closest to Ian Fleming's depiction of 007, I consider Skyfall to be the most mature, the most adult-oriented, the most beautifully crafted Bond movie. But just like Timothy Dalton's Bond didn't appeal to mainstream audiences, I fear Skyfall is too serious and too smart for the average moviegoer. I am concerned the producers might decide for the next installment to go back to the campy/light-hearted tone of the Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan eras that was more crowd-pleasing.The infallible superman Bond with no physical nor psychological flaws whatsoever is something of the past. Many people will disagree with me, but Skyfall should be the mold for the Bond movies of the future.",10,4,21,6 November 2012
Rocky IV," Rocky IV has the most amazing soundtrack ever!
","We all know the plot of Rocky IV is awfully thin (Soviet boxer comes to USA. Soviet boxer kills Rocky's friend. Rocky goes to Soviet Union to avenge aforementioned friend. End of script). And this movie has very little dialog. Granted. This movie is actually a 90-minute music video. Absolutely. And it's full of stereotypes and clich√©s on the USSR and Russians etc. Logically, this movie is total trash, and by far the worst Rocky movie.And you know what? Rocky IV is by far my favorite Rocky movie, and one of my all-time fave films. I know this defies all reason, but I'll tell why.I'm a huge Stallone fan, and once again Sly remarkably directed and acted in this fourth installment of the Rocky saga; the others actors sincerely and convincingly played their parts as well; the editing is impressive too. But the real star of the movie is in fact one you certainly didn't expect. As I said above, Rocky IV is a one-hour-and-a-half music video, and its real wonder is actually soundtrack author Vince DiCola. As much as I love and respect Bill Conti's work on all other Rocky movies, I must say that in my mind, DiCola's score on this movie surpassed Conti's and is the 'true', the 'ultimate' Rocky soundtrack. DiCola managed to capture the essence of Rocky, i.e. overcoming one's fears, fighting against the odds, perseverance in the face of adversity etc. I'm referring especially to 'Training Montage' and 'Heart's on Fire' (wonderfully sung by John Cafferty): more than any other piece of music I've heard in my life, Vince DiCola's tunes are incredibly inspiring, unbelievably motivating... Just listen to them, they'll pump you up like nothing else. Whatever your occupation is (physical or intellectual), they'll instantly put you on a high and in the right mindset to achieve your goal. DiCola's music is so powerful, combined with the impressive editing of the training scenes, I would even be tempted to say it has a near-magical power to motivate you. It's definitely the ultimate inspirational music. And the score in the rest of the film, especially 'War' during the final fight, is equally terrific. It makes you root for Rocky from the beginning to the end and feel his emotions.Stallone often had remarkable soundtracks for his movies (e.g. those by Jerry Goldsmith for the Rambo saga) and it's a shame and incomprehensible that DiCola wrote very few film scores (same for John Cafferty, why isn't he more famous?). I acknowledge that the first time I saw Rocky IV, I hated Vince DiCola's music because it was so different from Bill Conti's, but after watching the movie again, I came to adore it. In 1985, it was a score ahead of its time, and more than twenty years later, it still is. It hasn't lost an ounce of its power. Is it humanly possible to compose a more motivating soundtrack? Watch (and above all, listen to) Rocky IV from this perspective and you'll understand why there are so many people who love it.",10,26,30,30 January 2008
