Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazingly awful but makes for a great Rifftrax viewing!
","My first viewing of this movie was like that of many Star Wars fans. I waited in the long lines to see it, I was so excited I was actually about to see a new Star Wars movie. When the iconic opening music filled the theater I could hardly contain my excitement and then the movie started. Almost immediately something felt wrong but I pushed it away, this was Star Wars, it had to be good. I maintained this denial the entire movie, one boring, awkward, bland scene after the next. When the end credits came I was so confused, 'did that just totally suck ass or is it just me'? It had been at least 5 or 6 years since I had last seen this movie so I decided it would be a fun Rifftrax viewing and I was right but the movie seems even more awful then I remember it and I remembered it being really bad! It is disturbing to me that this movie has a IMDb score higher than 4.0, people like this movie for reals?",1,3,7,8 November 2011
Evil Dead," The Boring Dead
","Here is a list of the main problems with this movie.1. The plot: A group of youngsters accidentally summon a demon that must obtain 5 souls by first possessing them only to finally crawl out of the ground in a weaker and more easily killed form? Really? 2. Even though the premise is ridicules the movie takes itself seriously resulting in a movie that comes across as stupid, rather than being fun and enjoyable like 'Cabin in the woods.' 3. In order to care about what happens to the characters (which is where the 'horror' comes from) you must first be presented with actual characters. Cardboard cut-outs don't really do the trick.4. So many stupid little things that I can't list them all. At least make the god damn movie fun if it's going to be this stupid. Why not have Mia riding a motorcycle while fighting a flying demon monster with her chainsaw hand and sawed off shotgun? A little camp goes a long ways!",3,7,11,29 July 2013
Thor," Made for RIfftrax!
","This movie pretty much sums up everything I hate about Hollywood movies. After 30 minutes of watching I still have almost no feel for the characters but rather have sat through tons of boring over the top CGI action scenes that are devoid of any tension because I don't give a damn about the characters. This is one of the most clich√© 'someone from a different time/world/realm comes to modern day earth' movies I have seen and to make matters worse they (the film-makers) insist that it's funny! What a great use of 150 million dollars! Fu@k the poor starving nations, we gotta have more and more expensive movies! Censor the net, do whatever you want Hollywood just keep us entertained with more of your pornography!",1,9,15,10 January 2012
