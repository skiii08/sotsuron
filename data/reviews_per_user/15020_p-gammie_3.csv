Gremlins," Great Movie
",This definitely makes my top 10 plot a man named randy peltzer is looking for a present for his son billy Peltzer just as he seems to have run out of luck he discovers a small Chinese shop and a strange creature known as a Mowgli after a small argument with the shop owner randy finally gets it when the owners grandson gives it to him as well as telling him three rules 1. Don't expose him to sunlight 2. Don't get him wet and finally never feed him after midnight And so Randy takes it home. Billy is 22 and works at a bank (just a little bit of information) Any way Billy as well as his dog who seems to get on rather well with the creature who Billy calls Gizmo Randy tells Billy to remember the three rules. Billy being the typical person that he is breaks all the rules At first gizmo multiples creating 4 more Mowgli who then eat after midnight turning them into Gremlins viscous nasty goblin like creatures With help of his mum Billy succsefully kills off three gremlins except there leader Stripe who escapes to the swimming pool and jumps in all hell brakes loose I'm not really sure why i like this movie probably because of the music and because of the gremlins them selves there cool,8,2,4,13 August 2006
The Green Mile," Excellent movie
",I love this movie plot A man named John Coffrey is put on death row after being wrongly accused of rapping and killing two girls who he was really trying to save he is put under the watchful eye of Paul Edgecomb Percy Wetmore Brutus Howell and Warden Hal Moores. The three prison guards along with the two other prisoners Whos names i have forgotten learn a few things about John one he's scared of the dark and two he has faith healing powers. The reason i love this film is purely and simply because because of the character the development is excellent you really feel you know these people and i couldn't help but feel a little upset when John gets electrocuted at the end. The only person i didn't feel sorry for was Bill Wharton hes the guy who really killed those two girls but apart from that i felt sorry for the other people on death row.,10,0,2,12 August 2006
Halloween," Kind of Boring
","When I started to watch this I thought great I'm watching a real classic, unfortunately the movie doesn't really get going till halfway, all though I guess if you've watched clips, countless trailers and the ending it isn't going to be that exciting. But I feel great to have watched a classic like Halloween with out being scared all though nothing scares me. Anyway back to the point the movie kind of drags and the kills aren't that interesting they sound more like there having sex than being killed, if you're a horror fanatic watch this if you're more interested in blood and gore stick to scream. overall I found this kind of Disappointing compared to other movies I've watched",6,0,1,25 October 2006
