Requiem for a Dream," Dare yourself to see this movie
","Typically when I see a movie, I see it once, then never really think about it. If I really like a movie, which is not often, I'll watch it again if the chance is given. Anything past twice, is a rarity. Only a small select list of movies I can stand watching more than twice and never get bored. Requiem for a Dream is now on that list. I saw this movie three times in the theaters, and ended up weeping every time at the end. This is truly one of the best films I have ever sat down to watch. Screw D.A.R.E, give this movie to schools, and watch the drug problem disappear. You feel like when watching this movie that you know these characters. These are your brothers, sisters, mothers, blood relatives. It is one of the most gut wrenching films ever. While people are wonder how some films are able to be R when they should be NC-17. The MPAA did a grave injustice of making this NC-17. This is a must see for anyone who wanders the dark side of drugs. While Traffic, also a good film, covered the broad range of drugs from different views, this took the side of the actual user and showed the cold hard reality.",10,1,2,6 June 2001
Fight Club," True pay-per-view
","I was one of the lucky ones to get into an overbooked preview of Fight Club, and I got to say this is definitely one of top movies so far this year. Even worth it to see several times. This got tons of praise, and they are all right, for once. Men will enjoy the extreme violence in the movie. While the commericals/ads push about the bareknuckle underground fights, that's only about 1/3 of the movie. The rest is a very well-crafted plot along with excellent actors. So skip one of those pay-per-view fights on TV, go see this instead!",9,1,2,14 October 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A true comedy classic
","I saw this movie the first time when I was eight years old. It still holds a dear part of me of comedy classics, even now at the age of 23. This movie is a true rare classic that leaves no rocks unturned. This movie even stands the test of time, as the jokes are still hilarious even after 25 years. This movie has so many quotes & scenes that will stick to your mind like glue, its amazing. This movie just got re-released in widescreen to theaters, and if you can catch it, do so. Afterwards, be sure to grab the DVD, and grab your friends to watch it. You will watch it, LOL, ROFL, and other acronyms until your gut hurts watching this film. This is about as good as a comedy can get with being too disgusting.",10,0,0,12 June 2001
