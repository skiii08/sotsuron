Casablanca," A True Classic
","`They don't make Â‘em like that anymore!' is a well known saying normally associated with an older person commenting on something done by the younger generation. In the case of 1942's Casablanca, the comment is sadly true. That Casablanca is one of the all time great films is accepted fact. That it is a great story set solidly in its unique times and was done by several of the finest actors and actresses of any era is also accepted fact. What is not well known today is that expectations were low for this film before its New York premiere in November of 1942. Casablanca was a great war time morale builder for a United States of America still reeling from the sucker punch of Pearl Harbor. It remains today a film of intrigue, patriotism, love and human drama. That it holds up so well after 60 years may be its greatest accomplishment, and among Casablanca's many accomplishments are three academy awards. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns Rick's Cafe in Casablanca, a port city in French Morocco with no small amount of  back-stabbing and double dealing going on, but an important one because it is a major gateway to freedom and the west. Into his cafe and life walk freedom fighter and ex-concentration camp prisoner Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his beautiful wife and Rick's ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Soon we are caught up in a three way love triangle, desperate escape attempts, menacing Nazi officers, roguish police officials (Claude Rains) and Casablanca `business' men (Sydney Greenstreet). I believe I can assume that most people reading this have seen the film so I will just say that Casablanca has a semi-happy ending as we learn that there are many situations in life that we do not understand because they are not always what they seem. In the end, 60 years after its release Casablanca holds up because it is a fine human drama made oh-so-believable and real to us by its all-star cast. The wartime atmosphere is really only icing on the cake, but what fine icing it is.And what a cast. Humphrey Bogart. What man would not pay a hefty price to be able to look into the mesmerizing eyes of Ingrid Bergman and say, `Here's lookin' at you, kid.' Ingrid Bergman, the finest actress of her generation and, in the history of cinema's Grand Dames, perhaps the Grandest Dame of all, for those innocent dark eyes could make any man melt in his shoes. Claude Raines, dapper and elegant even in within the roguish role of the corrupt police Captain Louis Renault. (Isn't it interesting that yesterday's `bad guys' are in many ways more admirable than the so called `heroes' of today? Another sad commentary on our jaded times. However, in fairness I should point out that, although we suspected it all along, by film's end Renault turned out to be a better man than director Michael Curtiz wished us to think). Peter Lorre, in a small but important role as the weaselly Ugarte, gives the impression he would knife his grandmother for her church donation. Last but not least, Sydney Greenstreet, in my opinion the most menacing presence ever on the big screen, as the opportunistic Senor Ferrari turns in his usual masterful performance. It is a pity that Mr. Greenstreet's body of work in film was not greater. Still, many of the dozen or so he appeared in before his death in 1954 are considered classics today. So -- great story, superstar cast, wartime propaganda (slanted toward America and her allies. I wonder, what would have happened to Casablanca had Germany been victorious? I suspect it would be known only to a few film historians and most copies would have been destroyed. But, Germany didn't win and we do have one of filmdom's greatest readily available on VHS and DVD). Allow me a last comment on one of Casablanca's most memorable scenes. Late in the story, the Nazis are drunk in Rick's Cafe and singing loudly. I can just imagine the reaction of the 1942 theatergoers when suddenly Laszlo appears in the cafe, sees what is happening, and leads the rest of the cafe patrons in an impromptu singing of the Marseillase. The scene is powerful today, in 1942 it must have been emotional beyond description. As Bogey might have said, such is the stuff that film legend is made of!

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," An American Legend Fights a Private War
","It is not surprising this film had an Anne Rice type feel to it as it was shot in Louisiana. What is surprising to me is how, as one friend described it, such a ludicrous storyline could capture my fancy as it has. I suppose my fondness for horror films with catchy names has something to do with it. However, this one is more professionally done than such films as Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter or Billy the Kid vs. Dracula. (I'm not forgetting Buffy the Vampire Slayer!). If you have read the book, well written by author Seth Grahame-Greene, you are familiar with the story. I believe he did very well in taking a giant of American history, placing him in such a preposterous situation, and pulling it off with dignity and taste. The storyline, in case you are not aware, is straightforward and simple. As a child, young Abe Lincoln, (very well portrayed by Benjamin Walker), witnesses his mother being attacked by a vampire. After her death, he vows revenge. As it happens, a few years later the mysterious Henry Sturgess, (Dominic Cooper), injects himself into the life of Abe, now a young man. Sturgess trains Abe on how to be a vampire slayer. They create for Abe a specially made ax with the blade lined with silver. Older viewers will be reminded of the old Wild, Wild West television program. You will love the martial arts style ax work of Abraham Lincoln as he fights vampires to the death!We are deep into suspension of disbelief territory now, but that is the fun of films like this. Sturgess assigns Abe the vampires to be slain and Abe follows his directions to the letter. Eventually we are introduced to head vampire/plantation owner Adam, played by Rufus Sewell, who was my favorite character in the movie. His 'enforcer,' the beautiful Erin Wasson as Vadoma, adds spice to an already colorful story. Time passes and Abraham Lincoln is introduced to politics by meeting Stephen A. Douglas, (Alan Tudyk in an uncredited role) and eventually becomes the President of the United States. Abe has long since given up active pursuit of vampires, but learns the hard way that vampires and their hidden agenda are behind the secession of the southern states and the true cause of the Civil War.There will be no spoilers here. View the film to see how Honest Abe Lincoln ultimately saves the Union. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter runs 105 minutes, just about right for a film such as this. The special effects are nicely done and, for a film about vampires and blood, the gore is not excessive. Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, perhaps without intending to, injected a slight feel of a European view of the American Civil War into the story. This film will not be for everybody. Some will be offended at the use of Abraham Lincoln's name and reputation being used in this way. But, as stated earlier, it is done with dignity and Abraham Lincoln is every much the noble hero in the movie as we view him in real life. Something just as offensive, if not more so, is the use of the Confederacy as a mask for vampire domination. President Jefferson Davis is seen making a devil's deal with the despicable Adam and, for those of us with southern ancestry, this is disturbing. But, we need to remember this is a work of fiction, certainly not believable fiction in any way and I am certain there was no intention on the part of the writer to be disrespectful to anything or anybody.I would recommend this film if you like modern day horror film making. It is not a great film. It is a good film and highly entertaining, which is all a film such as this needs to be.",Null,1,2,27 June 2012
Chinatown," Cinema Classic
","`C'mon Jake, it's . . . Chinatown,' so utters Joe Mantell, one of the finest and least known character players of his generation, to Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes at film's end. Those of you who have seen the film realize that it is not about Chinatown at all, but what it stands for in the story: broken dreams and that things are often not what they seem.	Chinatown is a great film, truly one of the all time greats. As I type this I have the video jacket in front of me and the production / cast credits on the back read like a Who's Who in Hollywood in the1970's. (Chinatown was released in 1974). Robert Evans, Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Hillerman, Burt Young, John Huston. Robert Towne, to name a few, persons all well known to the public or whom someday would be. When viewed in this context, it is easy to understand why Chinatown is such a classic.	The story is too complicated and convoluted to go into detail here, as all of the great gumshoe films of the 1940's were, but a recap is in order. It is 1930's Los Angeles. Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is a private investigator making a nice living performing surveillance on wayward spouses. One day, a wealthy woman shows up wishing to hire Jake to trail her husband, who happens to be the Los Angeles water commissioner, only it turns out that the woman who did the hiring is not the man's wife. Gittes should have paid better attention to the alarm bell which went off in his mind because he is soon involved in public fraud, murder and family scandal. Along the way he falls in love with the water commissioner's real wife, the smoky and secretive Evelyn Mulray, ably played by Faye Dunaway, and a woman who is hiding a dark family secret. 	I won't give the finish away, but it does end in Chinatown in an unexpected and tragic way. 	I am not certain Chinatown could be shot and produced today as it was in 1974. There are excellent interior/exterior and location shots of 1930's architecture which today would be almost 30 years older. Director Roman Polanski's influence upon his pictures is, in my view, unique, for I have never seen anyone draw emotion out of his characters as he does. (I was reminded of this when I recently viewed The Pianist). It is a pity that his well-documented problems with the American legal system have kept him out of the United States for so many years, for I doubt that we will ever have the opportunity now to see if he has another American masterpiece within him, as was Chinatown and 1968's Rosemary's Baby. 	Another example of Polanski's genius is how he managed to make a masterpiece of a story which was shot in bright color but should have been filmed in black and white. (My imagination runs wild when I consider what Humphrey Bogart would have been like as Jake Gittes, or Sydney Greenstreet as the quintessentially evil Noah Cross, portrayed by John Huston and the father of Evelyn Mulray, together as they were in The Maltese Falcon, another film noir classic). Polanski not only used color but vivid color to turn the picture within itself and present a dark story in the full light of day. 	Jack Nicholson was a year away from his big success in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Faye Dunaway, who earned a place in my Grand Dame Hall of Fame with her performance as the benighted Evelyn Mulray, was at the height of her popularity and powers in 1974. Huston as the sinister Noah Cross will keep you awake at night after your first viewing of this film. Players such as John Hillerman and Burt Young would go on to greater success and popularity . Chinatown owes much of it's success to these players. 	A last word about the previously mentioned Joe Mantell who had a small role as one of Jake's investigators. He did utter the film's most famous line, but that is not all of his story. Mr. Mantell appeared in a 1960 Twilight Zone episode titled, `Nervous Man in A Four Dollar Room,' where he literally had to change his entire personality in real time on camera, Marc Scott Zicree, writing in The Twilight Zone Companion, (copyright 1982, Bantam Books), has this to say about him: `Joe Mantell is an actor not generally known, but he should be.' 	In Chinatown, even the bit players were great performers.",Null,0,2,16 June 2003
12 Angry Men," A Who's Who of Character Actors
","This is another classic film which I am certain nobody realized would be a classic when it was made. I doubt that director Sidney Lumet realized fully what he had in the cast he assembled, for many of the names were not yet household words in 1957, the year 12 Angry Men was produced. 	The names are impressive: Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Robert Webber, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Edward Binns, John Fiedler and a very young Jack Klugman are the players we recognize today as belonging in the Who's Who of American character actors of the era. Edward Sweeney and George Voskevec, capable artists in their own right, round out the cast. 	The story intrigues. Except for short sequences at the beginning and end, the story takes place entirely within a stuffy jury deliberation room. A jury of 12 men is charged with determining the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. In the beginning of deliberations, only Fonda believes the young man innocent. The story's brilliance comes in how it progresses to 11-1 for a guilty verdict to finally a 12-0 vote for acquittal. Along the way, we are introduced to each of the jurors in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The reasonable juror portrayed by Fonda, the hot-headed ultra conservative played by Cobb, the shallowness of Warden's character, and E.G. Marshall's thoughtful stockbroker are a few examples of character development within the setting of a jury room on a hot night.We learn much about the background and psyche of each juror as we progress along and the talents of each cast member shine brightly within the framework of an interesting story, a story which contains more than a little bit of social commentary on the times in which it was filmed. 	12 Angry Men is a must see for anyone interested in the human psyche and social commentary.",Null,0,0,18 August 2002
The Others," A masterpiece
","The Others is a great film, excellent in every way. Every now and then something truly outstanding comes along and so it was with The Others. Nicole Kidman, quite possibly the most beautiful woman of our time, checked her ego at the door and dressed down to portray a depressed war widow with two young children. The mood and atmosphere are perfect and one waits with eager anticipation the next offering of the film's young director, Alejandro Amenabar. 	The time is just after World War II and the place is a gloomy house sitting in the mist of the Jersey Isle. One is reminded of Wuthering Heights with the constant sense of Gothic dread and unease which Amenabar so capably created. Grace's (Kidman) children are ultra sensitive to light and the house must be kept dark at all times, a point which Grace hammers home to the new house servants who unexpectedly show up at her doorstep to offer their services. It seems they have worked in this house before and know it well -- too well as we soon see. Grace's daughter claims to see visions of others in the house and Grace worries about her emotional health. The daughter is precocious, her son unhealthily timid and it is obvious Grace is a very burdened woman. 	Grace becomes convinced that the house is indeed haunted and the suggestions of hauntings are what make this film a masterpiece. Unexplained sounds, sightings, shadows and timely creaking doors come along at just the right time. By the film's last few minutes, we have learned about the mysterious house servants and Grace's husband. We are now on the threshold of learning a dark secret and experiencing an interesting plot twist. 	The use of shadows, lighting, sound, music and the body movement of the players (I have not mentioned what a fine supporting cast appears with Ms. Kidman, another important reason this is such a fine film) bring back memories of the conventional haunted house stories of days gone by. 21st century technology is an asset, not a burden here, and that is, sadly, not always the case. It is interesting to note also that The Others is every bit as atmospheric viewed in your living room as it was on the theatre big screen and  that is a credit to Amenabar's skill. You may even say his genius, because this is one fine piece of work. It may very well be that this becomes his signature offering, for it will be very difficult for him to top The Others.",10,0,0,22 May 2002
