Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nothing missing? How about a script?
","Okay, perhaps I'm guilty of breaking the cardinal rule when it comes to blockbusters: expecting a good script.  Most blockbusters concentrate on the effects and action, and the directors and producers hope that these will distract you from realizing that the story is mundane and the plot and dialogue were conceived over lunch at Spago.  I expected Star Wars to be different.  I was mistaken.Star Wars is a special case, of course, because we know how the entire thing will eventually end.  This kind of viewer foreknowledge poses a special challenge for the writers because for the most part the plot is already established.  The writer has less room to work.  Even so, the script Lucas wrote for Phantom Menace was especially poor.  The dialogue was uninspired and uninteresting, the plot development cliched and predictable.  If I didn't know better, I could have sworn I was watching a reproduction of 'Star Wars' with a new troop of actors.The script's shortcomings, as usual, meant that the special effects had to carry the film.  Unfortunately, they don't.  We've reached a point where special effects are common-place elements in film.  It's no longer a matter of WHAT is done, whether it's staging a big starship dogfight or big battlefield scene with computer animation.  Everyone can do that now.  Now it's a matter of HOW you do it, and that places the onus back on the script-writer to be creative and resourceful.  I can think of only two times in Phantom Menace where the special effects impressed me, and in both cases it was because I found the effect clever rather than dazzling.  Very few of PH's effects are things you haven't already seen in other films.Lucas deserves credit for one interesting plot development, depending on how he uses it in the coming installments.  That development is the story behind Annakin's birth.  With this story Lucas has a real opportunity do something interesting and substantial in the next installments.  It remains to be seen if he has the courage and creativity to realize the potential that's there.Is Phantom Menace a bad film?  Not exactly.  Is it a good film?  Not exactly.  What we're dealing with is a mediocre film with some engaging moments spread among many tedious ones.  Go see it, but leave your expectations at the door.",Null,0,1,25 May 1999
Memento," Dark and interesting
","Others have noted that if the last thing the main character remembers is his wife dying, then he shouldn't remember that he has short-term memory loss. Some might consider this the fatal flaw of 'Memento'.  I recognize it as a flaw, but I don't find it fatal.  'Memento' makes a poignant comment on the role emotion and prejudice play in the construction of memories.  By sequencing events in a finish-to-start chronology , 'Memento' manages to envelope the audience in the same bewilderment that the main character (Guy Pearce of 'L.A. Confidential fame in a terrific performance) experiences while also playing on our emotions and prejudices.  We have to struggle to keep the plot straight, and as events prior to the ones we've just seen unfold, the assumptions we've made about the characters get challenged and the characters' actions take on new meaning.  We have to reinterpret everything that's happened just as the main character does.  Dark, stimulating and stylish.",9,0,1,30 October 2001
Snatch," Near top of genre
","For years and years in the 50's and 60's the western was the leading genre in movies.  Now, the gangster film currently enjoys that title, and 'Snatch' stands as one of the more enjoyable of that lot.  'Snatch' sets out to entertain, pure and simple.  As you'd expect from a film about Cockney gangsters, the film offers distinct, quirky characters.  It helps greatly that skillful actors inhabit each part and clearly relish the opportunities. Add the visual and editing stylishness informed by the director's experience with music videos, good choices in pop music (except for the Madonna stuff), and lots of plot twists, and you get an entertaining film. It's not Oscar-worthy stuff, but it is fun.A word about Brad Pitt's accent in the film.  Many have called it the worst Irish accent they've ever heard.  This would be an insult to Pitt's craft but for the fact that it's plainly explained in the film that he's not Irish.  He's a 'gypo', or gypsy.  And while he may have Irish ancestry, his gypsy vocation incents him to muddle his pronunciation and accent to something that sounds vaguely like speaking but is nearly completely unintelligible at first blush (one catches on after a few listens).",9,0,1,3 October 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," I haven't read the books, but...
","I think this movie could have been better.  While I loved Grant's portrayal of Daniel as well as Firth's perfectly understated portrayal of Mark Darcy, I couldn't help but think that Zellweger wasn't the best choice for Bridget. Weight gain or not, she's hardly the average-looking woman that I assume Bridget is in the books.  The idea that someone this cute would have trouble meeting a companion wasn't particularly convincing.On top of that, Zellweger's Bridget seemed downright happy-go-lucky, not weighed down by her situation.  There was very little bitterness, if any, on display, and Zellweger didn't communicate the kind of desperation you'd expect from this person.  While she spoke/wrote of eating and drinking too much, these were usually presented comically and had no dramatic weight. There are real people in the same sorts of predicaments who pacify their disappointment in drink and food, and it's rarely cute or comical.  The movie would have benefited greatly from a truer representation of Bridget's disappointment, making the ending that much more satisfying.",Null,1,1,16 April 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Well done fluff
","This remake of the Rat Pack original is about what you'd expect out of the material and director.  It possesses a good pace, isn't too indulgent and has a certain style to it.  That it's almost completely predictable is beside the point.With Pitt, Clooney and Garcia in this film, my wife couldn't have been happier.  The one with whom she's most enamored, Clooney, smirks a lot, can't act and isn't believable.  Luckily Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould and Brad Pitt CAN act, and along with Andy Garcia they put on quite a show.  Reiner, in particular, hits just the right note, and given that he was hired to replace Alan Arkin just days before they started shooting (Arkin had become unavailable due to illness), it's all the more impressive.  Gould, fitted with the perfect wardrobe, was born to play this role.  Years ago Pitt met the fork in his career path and chose 'actor' over 'movie star', and that choice is evident here.More could have been done with the screenplay, particularly the dialogue. It doesn't percolate the way you'd expect it to in a film like this.  Even so, the story telling is tight, and the editing paces the film just right. Soderbergh directs with a sense of style, particularly the post-caper seen in front of the waterfall which is a clever, if incongruous, way to let the actors take a bow.  Basically, this film is fluff, but it's well done fluff.",7,0,1,27 December 2001
Donnie Brasco," Great addition to mob film catalog
","Based on real people and events, Donnie Brasco covers territory that I've not seen covered in other mob films. It examines the price that gets paid by those working undercover as well as their families. While unflinching in portraying the brutality of the mob, the film weaves a thread of sympathy into the fabric of mafia life and suggests that what motivates mobsters isn't always money, power or savage instinct. As much as possible, Donnie Brasco humanizes its mafia subjects without excusing their brutal acts and reveals the fundamental trap of gang life.Pacino and Depp are truly masterful in their performances. I watched the film once again last night, and it's just a pleasure to watch them work. I can't imagine any other pair of actors approaching the verity they bring to the screen. I highly recommend Donnie Brasco.",9,0,0,6 February 2007
