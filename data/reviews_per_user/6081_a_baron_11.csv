Insidious: Chapter 2," Insidious: Chapter 2
","As horror films go, this one isn't at all bad, although there is the usual confusion with ghost/dream sequences. A psychic is murdered while trying to exorcise a ghost, apparently by someone or something from the other side. A boy is possessed, or has been possessed, or is he still now that he is a grown man with a family of his own? Part of the confusion is that this is a sequel. It turns out that the culprit is a serial killer who committed suicide by jumping out of a hospital window, and in turn he was under the influence of his mother who insisted on dressing him up as a girl. There are a couple of parapsychologists/ghost hunters involved, and what appears to be an attempt to inject a bit of comedy into the film, which fails dismally. Its real redeeming feature though is that there are some genuinely scary moments, not in the spook department necessarily, but like that time in 'Jaws' when the shark turns up unexpectedly.",7,0,0,23 June 2015
Angels & Demons," Angels & Demons
","This film is said to have an estimated budget of $150,000,000. When one considers some of the crowd scenes and special effects, that is credible. Nothing else about 'Angels & Demons' is. To begin with, the founding of the Order of the Illuminati can be dated very precisely to May 1, 1776; Galileo kicked the bucket in 1642, the same year the greatest scientist who ever lived was born, and he died two decades before Adam Weishaupt was born. Doubtless there are many other errors/poetic licences herein, including geographical ones.The most improbable thing about the film is its timescale - no way all this could have been accomplished in the space of a single day, less than a single day. Having said all that, even if you are not a Tom Hanks fan, you may find the fast pace and non-stop action/suspense to your like.",7,0,0,22 July 2019
Monster," Monster
","Although Charlize Theron won an Oscar for her performance here, deservedly so, the film bends over backwards to put a human face on Aileen Wuornos that she doesn't really deserve. True, for those at the very bottom of society, life does seem like a conspiracy to hold them down, something that is evident here, but Wuornos had her chances. There is no mention in 'Monster' of her marriage to a much older and extremely wealthy man, a big chance that she threw away by brutalising him. Her love interest Selby (in reality Tyria Moore) was a butch lesbian and absolutely nothing like the delectable Christina Ricci. Having said that, she was undoubtedly the only good thing in the serial killer's life after they met, and did her best for her. Here, she is portrayed as a little girl lost sponging off Wuornos, and in awe of her prostitute image.The first victim - Richard Mallory - is shown brutalising and raping Wuornos after the 'trick' turns sour; in reality, although Mallory was a sexual deviant, there is no evidence that in their encounter he was anything more than a man who paid for sex and ended up dead.The film ends effectively when Wuornos and her lover part company, although we see a glimpse of her first murder trial, but nothing after that. Not a bad soundtrack either, but although 'Don't Stop Believin'' is a great song, it sounds lyrically dissonant here.",8,0,0,4 February 2015
Hostel," Hostel
","This one gets one point for special effects, and one more because there is no zero rating on this site. Three red-blooded young American males touring Europe with backpacks and sowing some wild oats meet up with a stranger in Amsterdam who persuades them that a hostel in Slovakia is where they should be, where the girls are...heck, why wouldn't they? If they knew what lay in store for them they would have been on the first plane back to the States, but alas...This is another sick fantasy from the brain of Quentin Tarantino, the hostel in question is run by people who supply victims for an outfit that offers a service to people with equally sick minds, strap him - or her - to a chair and kill him as quickly or as slowly as you like. The police are in on it too, in fact this is an enormous conspiracy, it has to be, which begs the question, can it really be run at a profit unless its clients are billionaires?Fortunately, this sort of operation cannot exist in real life, unfortunately there are plenty of warmongers, terrorists and serial killers on the loose doing similar things, which begs the question, how many of the latter have been inspired by the likes of Quentin Tarantino?",2,0,2,26 December 2015
The Babadook," The Babadook
","Amelia is a young widow; her husband, the father of her son, was killed in a car crash seven years ago, and if the boy is not mad he is slowly driving her nuts with his obsessing over the Babadook, a mysterious entity which is really only a character from a rather weird children's book. Or is it real? Certainly he seems to think so, and his obsession is so out of hand that he is as good as thrown out of school, and is causing his mother's friends to ostracise her. Well, if you are invited to a birthday party where you throw a young girl out of a tree house, what else can you expect?As far as psychological thrillers go, this is not a bad offering; we've seen it all before of course, as with 'The Exorcist', but this film - which is really more of a play with two leads and a side cast - has no real resolution, though it must surely have been a baptism of fire for 7 year old Noah Wiseman. Few roles he takes on later in his career are likely to be anywhere near as trying as this.",7,4,9,16 February 2015
X-Men," X-Men
","The original X-Men date to 1960s American comic books and were created by the recently deceased Stan Lee along with Jack Kirby. The line-up here is somewhat different but will be more familiar to the younger generation, who will probably miss the joke about yellow spandex.As usual with films of this nature, the plot is both predictable and fairly irrelevant: a supervillain and his henchmen are Hell-bent on either world domination or destruction on a massive scale, and the good guys are here to see this doesn't happen.With this film also it is probably best not to read too much into the origins of the characters and any political allusions, ie about people being alienated, hated or even murdered because they look different or are different.Where 'X-Men' scores is of course with special effects, and it does so grandiosly, unless of course they really did destroy the Statue Of Liberty in the climatic finale?",9,0,0,22 July 2019
Crash," Crash (2004)
","Most people would agree that America is obsessed with race, certainly its politicians of a certain political bent are. This film is set in Los Angeles only a decade after the O.J. Simpson double murder trial, and before that the disgraceful Rodney King incident which was followed by the even more disgraceful Los Angeles riots after the acquittal of King's uniformed assailants. All the same it is difficult to believe that all the principal characters would have been as obsessed with race as they are portrayed in this film, and it isn't only the whites who are bigots.Weird happenstances and outrageous coincidences happen every day, but those herein beggar belief, and would a police officer really have sexually assaulted a woman in front of both her husband and his own partner during a traffic stop? In 1985, Anthony Pacho was indicted for fondling shoplifting suspects; although the former Glendale police officer would eventually plead guilty at Los Angeles Superior Court to lesser charges, it is most doubtful if a veteran officer would have jeopardised his pension with the sort of outrage depicted here two decades on.As for the redemption in this film, bad people can do good things, and do all the time. Alas, there is no redemption for some, including the people behind 'Crash'.",2,0,1,21 May 2020
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange
","The character Doctor Strange first appeared way back in 1963. As all, certainly all the major, Marvel superheroes have long since made it to the big screen, his appearance was long overdue. The film loses nothing for those who are not au fait with the man himself; obviously it can cover only a tiny percentage of his adventures, so naturally it concentrates on his origin.Also unsurprising is the fact that it has been updated – just in case you didn't realise there was no WiFi in the 1960s – but the plot is, well, difficult to follow at a first viewing. There is no sex worthy of the name, and for the most part only comic book violence, so it may not be suitable for adults. Its strong point is special effects, even if you don't understand them either, and just in case you have never heard of him, watch out for a three second cameo appearance by a 93 year old Stan Lee.",7,1,1,22 June 2017
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters
","If you didn't realise from the title, you would have done from the first couple of minutes, this is a fantasy, and therefore not to be taken too seriously. It isn't exactly a modern take on the famous German fairy tale, but there are one or two anachronisms here and there, their weapons in particular.There isn't that much of a plot to it, suffice it to say that a particularly evil and powerful grand witch has some dastardly plans afoot including child sacrifice, but with the help of a white witch, an autograph hunter and a friendly troll, the fearless siblings might just defeat the forces of darkness.This film has some half decent special effects, as well as witches who ride on broomsticks and kick like Bruce Lee. The big question though is who is the target market? Certainly not prepubescent kids with the sort of language used here.",7,0,0,31 July 2015
Sinister," Sinister
","A novelist turned true crime writer moves into a house where a mass murder was committed; one of the victims has not been found, a young girl, but she is presumed dead by the local sheriff, who doesn't like the newcomer on account of things he's said about police officers in general. Our scribe has of course told his wife about the connection, although she has no idea they are living in the actual house where the murders were committed, and when she finds out, she is understandably livid. Well dear he tells her, the victims weren't killed in the house but in the back garden, hung from that thar tree. Unsurprisingly, she's not buying it. On top of that, their son suffers from night terrors and his daughter wants to move back to their previous palatial home. Naturally this doesn't wash, and of course he wants to both solve the murders and find the missing girl alive. Then he makes a mysterious find, some old style film and a projector in the attic which the police and everyone else appear to have overlooked. When he views this film and with some help from a junior law officer who has a degree in criminology, he becomes convinced this is the work of a serial killer who has been at large since the 1960s. Or could this be some sort of cult? More to the point, how much of it is in his head?His helper with the badge points him to an academic who suggests there is indeed a demonic connection, an ancient deity called Bagul, the devourer of children. So is he looking for a serial killer, a demon, or maybe he should just pack up and run? After yet another scare he chooses the latter, but is flight the right thing? Somehow you get the impression this is all going to end very badly.This film has some good atmospheric moments; the implication is that the ghosts of the victims are not in his head, and some of the happenings defy rational explanation. Many films of this type are confusing with dream sequences, flashbacks and so forth. By and large, 'Sinister' avoids these pitfalls, but don't watch it if you like happy endings.",7,0,1,29 May 2015
Sin City," Sin City
","How to describe 'Sin City' - Twenty-First Century film noire with a splash of red thrown in, fantasy combined with comic book violence and sadism? Somewhat disjointed, especially if you haven't read the associated graphic novel. On the other hand, perhaps the viewer is not meant to read much or anything into it.This one is strictly for devotees of the genre. At around two hours it is also heavy for the uninitiated. Its saving grace, if it can be said to have one, is a half-decent soundtrack.",6,0,3,8 January 2020
