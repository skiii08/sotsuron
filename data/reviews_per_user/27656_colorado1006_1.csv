10 Cloverfield Lane," Pointless, Ridiculous & Abandoned Story Lines
","This was a stupid movie that probably could have been good. I don't understand the whole story line of his alleged 'daughter.' What ever happened to her? That story was abandoned, so what was the point in introducing it in the first place? He was obviously a psycho too, but the only person with a fall-out shelter. Right. I never once really believed anything was happening outside. Then it turns out to be ridiculous in the end. One girl single-handedly takes out the big bad alien (with a molotov cocktail no less) but our military couldn't destroy it? Sure, that's believable. Ugh.",3,0,0,11 July 2018
