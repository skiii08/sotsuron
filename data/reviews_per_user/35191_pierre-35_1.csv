Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great visuals, poor movie making.
","The settings were spectacular as were some of the action scenes. But the movie was nothing more than a children's fairy tale with little plot and concepts which too were simplistic. If you want a visually entertaining film with no stimulation for the mind, this is for you.",6,0,1,25 June 1999
