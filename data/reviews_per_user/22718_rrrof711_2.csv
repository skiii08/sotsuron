Skyfall," Lame
","Who wrote the reviews for Skyfall, new James Bond movie, corporate hacks at MGM? Everyone on IMDb hated it. worst Bond movie evar... I love the James Bond franchise but was extremely disappointed with this movie. The best part of the entire movie was the intro! still a bit flashy and over zealous in it's approach mimicking the Goldeneye intro or Casino Royale but going way overboard. Great song for Bond intros just wished they had toned all the mirrored images and obvious spoiling of the main sequences in the movie. I would rather watch Die Hard for some asshole shooting people with a vengeance. The plot was so watered down it made me think a high school kid wrote it. Reminded me of Mission Impossible without the fast paced quick thinking wittiness. A couple of good one liners but overall kinda lame.",2,8,22,7 February 2013
Lucy," An amazing, smart, action packed joy ride!!!!
","First off, this is one of the best written, choreographed, acted and thought-out movies I have seen in a long time! The action is intense but so are the mind bending philosophical quandaries and scientific/pseudo-metaphysical theory busting propositions/hypotheses.... I feel like this movie may be too much for some people to wrap their brains around but it has such great effects and fight scenes it could probably keep a teenager occupied for the full hour and a half (if their parents let them watch it). This movie can be compared to others but aren't most movies nowadays ramped up contrivances of past scripts and monologues????!!!! The idea of this movie reminds me of James Bond movies, Jackie Chan movies and the movie Altered States. It has a little bit of everything for everyone (except young kids). Though, if you don't like action, Scarlett Johansson, surreal ideas or Morgan Freeman, you might not like this movie.",10,7,12,3 October 2017
