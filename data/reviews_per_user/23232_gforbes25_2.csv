United 93," An Excellent Gripping Film
","I saw this movie last night with a friend and have felt numb since leaving the theater. At the close of the movie, we all just sat there. It was as if we were all at the funerals of those who perished on that tragic day. People were sobbing.Words can't describe what transpired in that movie theater last night. You quickly forgot you were at the movies and the actors pulled you in to the point you felt you were actually on the plane and this was happening to you.The brave people on Flight 93 are the true hero's of September 11, 2001. Go see this movie.",10,3,10,30 April 2006
Finding Neverland," Awe Inspiring...
","I have never posted on here, but have been a big fan of this website for quite sometime. I enjoy reading other comments, but have never posted one before, until I saw Finding Neverland. This movie left my in tears for several minutes after it ended. I watched it with friends and we were laughing at how emotional it got us. What an amazing journey this movie takes you on and it tugs at that inner child and vivid imagination we have in all all of us.Wonderfully acted, Johnny Depp is just brilliant. You are there with him, the whole time seeing what it is like to be in his head. Kate Winslet is wonderful in this movie. These two actors are simply that best we have in cinema.This is bar none the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I can never recall having a movie this much on my mind long after I have watched it. You must see this movie, I assure you it will land its way on your top 10 list.",10,3,3,17 April 2005
