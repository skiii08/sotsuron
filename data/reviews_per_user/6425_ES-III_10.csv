The Blair Witch Project," A letdown of major proportions in amateur film-making!
","I was so damned excited to see this film when I first heard about its premise - three film-students go out in the middle of nowhere in search of a local myth, and never return, though their film footage resurfaces a year or so later.  And while I'll probably be crucified or burned at the stake for saying it, I certainly don't see what all the hubbub is about! I come from a pretty decent film background, and have viewed plenty of student-work that's both similar and superior!  So, first, I have to ask -- what's the attraction?  Three people get lost in the woods while making a documentary on a local legend and eventually die, making this what some people are calling `the scariest film ever.'  I don't think so. `The Blair Witch Project' (great title, by the way) is filmed in the documentary style, yet it divulges the whole scam prior (that the film is staged), making me wonder how viewers can insert themselves into the characters' dilemma or feel any of their pain and anguish.  I agree that the fear of the unknown is oftentimes the spookiest, but if you're in on the joke, then it's known (and therefore invalid).  I wish that the truth of the filming would have been kept a secret; that the directors and company would have kept their mouths shut and let the media-ball continue to roll - then, and only then, would `The Blair Witch Project' have been scary.  Sure, you could fire right back, saying a documentary that encompasses fiction is every bit as justifiable as `Halloween' or `The Shining,' but then again, those two films had genuine stories and backgrounds - nothing ever happens in this film that justifies fear. I understand the directors' intent to reveal real fear, rather than produce digitally-effected monsters that spew blood and goo from their eyes and noses -- and I think it's true that the human imagination conjures up plenty of s**t scarier than any three Stephen King books -- but put a real ski-mask-clad chainsaw-wielding half-breed in the woods with these three characters (in actuality), and watch how quickly their lost-in-the-woods scenario and mysterious pagan stick-figures become secondary.  Hey, Marlon Perkins' Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom specials are real and rousing, but they're not really scaring the pants off of anyone, y'know? Secondly, though to a lesser degree, the movie is pretty poorly made (a fact acknowledged by the film-makers), due to a lack of budget.  And while I celebrate the crew's resourcefulness, the hokum is nonetheless still present (does the fact that you're shooting in a documentary style vindicate amateur film-making?  Only future directing jaunts from Myrick and Sánchez can answer that one).  Still, there are a lot of good scenes: Heather's self-filmed confession (completed when she runs out of faith) is unsettling, and some of the locals' stories are just great.  Plus, the creepy ending is pure art no matter where or how it was shot.  And not to be overlooked, the crude bundles of twigs and unsettling stick figures actually look like they were created by a Wicca-starved witch or hermit. Sure, there was a mini `Blair Witch' craze that swept through the American underground, but I'll still take `The Sentinel,' `The Shining' and `The Exorcist' any day!",Null,0,1,5 June 2003
The Big Lebowski," Going Against the Grain Here
","This from the makers of Fargo and Raising Arizona? The Big Lebowski stars Jeff Bridges as Jeff Lebowski, a cranky, unemployed, foul-mouthed, pot-head slacker embroiled in a mistaken-identity farce. I've never liked Bridges' ponderous acting, and he doesn't score any points for me here as the self-proclaimed `Dude' either.Anyway, two goons break into his apartment thinking he's Pasadena millionaire Jeff Lebowski and proceed to rough him up and piss on his throw-rug.  `That rug really tied the room together,'' the Dude moans. Miffed, he tracks down the real Jeff Lebowski and steals a Persian rug, unwittingly becoming jumbled-up in a kidnapping caper.  The Big Lebowski then hires the incompetent Dude to make a money drop for Lebowski's kidnapped trophy wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), but his short- tempered, pistol-happy, Vietnam-vet bowling buddy Walter Sobcek (John Goodman) bungles the plan, accelerating the two into a bizarre state of affairs.There's a lot to like, but not enough to keep the viewer seriously engaged. That's due to the fact that half of the characters are amazing, and half are routine oddballs.  Sex-crazed Latino bowler/pervert Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) is worth seeing, and Sam Elliot's mustache alone is worth the price of admission, but Elliot is some critically wasted talent here! Plus, I've never seen an actor overact as much as John Goodman does in the first half. and if I see Steve `Can I Get Any Other Role?' Buscemi play another little creepy loser I'm gonna die!  On the other hand, Julianne Moore (Boogie Nights) plays erotic artist Maude Lebowski sexy and rough - there's a memorable scene where she covers part of her body with paint and hurls herself through the air in a leather harness to create a piece.  Plus, the Big Lebowski's right-hand man, Brandt (played by Boogie Nights' Philip Seymour Hoffman), is equally absorbing.  Nevertheless, it's a patrol officer (played by Michael Gomez) who gets the biggest laughs as the Dude picks up his recently stolen car from the police corral - blink and you'll miss it!The film offers bursts of enlightenment in an otherwise quirky `indie-feel' movie, but doesn't really commit to the audience at any given point. Perhaps the Cohens are purposely treating us to the languid, uninspiring existence that is the Dude in hopes that we'll be quiescent enough to enjoy their blundering film.",Null,0,0,8 November 2002
Amistad," No new tricks here, just the same archetypal Spielberg
","Spoiler, perhaps?  After ripping movie-goers off with The Lost World, Steven Spielberg tosses out a less-then-fulfilling flick, this time in the guise of Amistad. True story: in the summer of 1839, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) and fifty-some Africans aboard the Spanish slave ship La Amistad break free of their shackles, kill the crew, take control of the ship and reclaim their freedom, hoping to return to Africa.  However, without any navigational skills, the Africans bank on two surviving members of the original crew.  Too bad, because after two months, an American naval ship captures the Amistad and the Africans are charged for murder and piracy. OK, now you've got fifty Africans who don't speak English or Spanish, an abolitionist named Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) who just stands around, a young real-estate lawyer named Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) and pro-slavery President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), who only wants to appease the South.  Mix them together and you've got a typical `good versus evil' Speilberg film.  And let me tell you something, ole Stevie sure has a hard-on for these dastardly, `I'm-an-immoral-symbol-of-everything-that's-wrong-with-America-and-the-system' villains: Amistad maintains that white people are generally evil, just as ET and Jurassic Park painted humans capitalistic and exploitive and Schindler's List made everyone who wasn't Jewish in the 40s `bad.'  Hell, even The Color Purple made an argument that most black men were ignorant and irresponsible.  In other words, enough is enough!!  Speilberg, one of the world's most talented film-makers, has succumbed to making carbon-copy connect-the-dots movies, and gloats in the disappointing results. Schindler's List was both suspenseful and amazing, but why re-make it (as another giant turning point in American history).  Next, Speilberg can make a version for the Native-Americans, then one for the Irish, then one for Croatians and maybe when he's done, he'll get back to making movies again. If creating a film of this magnitude, why not focus on Dredd Scott or Nat Turner stories. The movie isn't un-watchable by any means, and Spielberg pulls some strong and shocking scenes out of his bag of tricks, but we've seen this stuff before.  Highlights include Anthony Hopkins (as former President John Quincy Adams  the film's hero) and his great eleven-minute court-room speech, as well as the performances from Djimon Hounsou and  Matthew McConaughey (in his best role).  Let's just say I wasn't spellbound.",Null,0,3,5 June 2003
Blade," Slingblade this ain't!
","Spoilers, perhaps?  Wesley Snipes stars as Blade, a modern-day vampire hunter pulled from the pages of Marvel Comics' '70s schlock-o-rama title, `Tomb Of Dracula.'  He doesn't have the afro, the goggles or the orange trenchcoat, but nonetheless Snipes' version would kick the s**t out of the Marvel character!  Because Blade is a baaad man - a seemingly immortal killing machine who possesses the superhuman strength and evil cunning of a vampire but none of their weaknesses (daylight, garlic, etc.).  Born a `daywalker,' he relies on his blood-cursed heritage to understand and conquer the undead enemy. From the opening scene, a bloodbath of epic proportions, viewers know this film is the real deal - no pulling punches here.  Built around countless action scenes, it employs amazing effects, plenty of video-game carnage, sensational camera angles, bizarre sets and excellent fight scenes.  But, as usual, it's got a pretty archetypal action/sci-fi storyline: Blade and Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), in the middle of a bloody crusade of vampire-vanquishing, unearth a diabolical plot hatched by their preeminent adversary, the vampire overlord Deacon Frost (an overacting Stephen Dorff). Using the different vampire keys, Frost tries to seize control of the House of Erebus, become Bloodlord and reign over all vampires to suppress humanity in a bloodsucking Armageddon.  And kudos to the final confrontation between Blade and Frost in the illusory vampire mosque - someone actually dies without coming back six or seven times (just like the old kung-fu movie showdowns)! N'Bushe Wright (Dead Presidents) plays Karen, a blood specialist who doesn't really do much in the film but follow Blade around and solicit the plot of the movie, and Traci Lords plays Racquel, a pretty vampire seen only in the opening sequence - two needless characters. With the aforementioned opening scene and characters like Pearl, `Blade' rises above the other sci-fi induced comic-book movies (like `The X-Men' or `Daredevil') as pure fun and eye-popping entertainment.  It's nice to see a company like New Line Cinema; one with the balls to make rough and tumble films like `Last Man Standing,' `Rumble In the Bronx,' `Boogie Nights,' `Dark City' and `Spawn.'",Null,0,1,5 June 2003
Blade II," A very meaningless sequel with little redemption value...
","I could be wrong, but there's not a lot of plot going on in this follow-up to the surprise '98 hit `Blade.'  Again, Blade (Wesley Snipes), the half man, half vampire, gets to save humanity from a blood-drenched Armageddon in a very violent, round-about way. Here, Blade aligns himself with a militant group of vampires (The Bloodpack) -- originally trained to kill him -- to battle a new genetically-enhanced strain of super-vampires called Reapers who feed on both vampire and human. The hunt takes Blade into the compound of vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), where he meets Nyssa (Leonor Varela), Damaskinos's exotic daughter.  His infiltration unveils many secrets of the vampire sect, but not too much more, unless you consider fighting scenes a crucial part of the narrative. To the film's credit, super-Reaper Jared Nomak (Luke Goss) is highly entertaining, and del Toro creates some pretty stunning visuals, like the vampire autopsy and the Reapers who have a scar down the center of their chins that spreads out into retractable jaws.  Outside of that, the only redeeming factor is Blade's mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), as crusty and bad-mannered as ever.  The film actually throws in a useless, unrelated subplot just to have Kristofferson back for the ride -- he didn't die, but was instead infected with the vampire virus and taken overseas (of course!). Still, `Blade II' is nothing like the first installment  instead, it's all flash and blood and guns and `Matrix' kicks.  The first brought `humanity' into the picture; this one ignores it.  For example, when Blade's industrial unit is attacked by messengers from Damaskinos, a ten-minute fight ensues before the invaders  risking death -- stop and let Blade know they're just stopping by to deliver a message (maybe have some blood and crumpets).  And the characterization is horrible  the Bloodpack is easily one of the worst and least-memorable collection of heavies I've seen since 1997's `Con Air'  bombastic, predictable, stereotypical, and pumped full of steroids. Furthermore, outside of the physical stunts, this couldn't have been a very challenging role for Snipes (he only has five minutes of dialogue scattered throughout the film at best).  Why bother using an actor at all  just digitally generate Blade in the next flick!  Oh, and did I mention that everyone in the film knows some type of martial-arts must be a vampire pre-requisite or something?  I hear those late-night vampire karate-schools are all the rage out in LA!",Null,0,0,5 June 2003
Face_Off," The duality of Archer and Troy
","[Lots of spoilers].  Exchanged identities always make for an interesting story when done accurately (see Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Mark Twain's `Those Extraordinary Twins' or even Pudd'nhead Wilson), and this is one that's done right!  The substitution of identities, guises, and faces is the thrust of esteemed cult/action director John (Hard-Bolied, The Killer) Woo's Face/Off, a really weird movie.  Full of more riveting twists, layered plotlines, and nerve-racking action than just about anything since The Usual Suspects, I'm both surprised and refreshed that something this creatively twisted rolled off the Hollywood mass production line and was revered by popular culture.  Better yet, I'm happy as hell that both Nicolas Cage and John Travolta had the balls to play such bizarre characters! Travolta's character, adamant FBI agent Sean Archer, goes underground to investigate the location of a biological weapon planted by his arch rival, the sadistic terrorist-for-hire who killed his son, Castor Troy (Cage).  In doing so, Archer undergoes a radical procedure in `advanced medical technology' that involves the surgical removal of Troy's face Â– it's actually transplanted onto his bare skull in order to enter prison disguised and obtain information from Castor's paranoid schizophrenic brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola).  But things go haywire when Troy, emerging from a coma, transforms into Archer and wreaks some serious havoc upon his life, both at work and at home. `A game of cat-and-mouse' hardly describes the paradoxical contest that Archer and Troy, each trapped in the enemy's body, engage forces in. The evil Troy goes home to Archer's wife (Joan Allen) and teenage daughter (Dominique Swain), convincing them that he's the husband and father they know.  Yes, for years, Archer has been no-nonsense and unromantic -- imagine the surprise of Archer's wife when the `new' Archer treats her like a new lover!  Meanwhile, Archer is sent to a high-security prison where the inmates wear magnetized boots that allow security to keep track of every footstep. Woo gleefully harvests Machiavellian versions of the good and bad epitome of morality and depravity, constructing a flip-flop plot that involves the families of both characters and an awesome mirror stand-off scene where both characters, trapped in the other's body, gaze at their own reflection (which in reality is the other person behind the mirror).  This is one movie you shouldn't miss!",Null,0,0,8 November 2002
Good Will Hunting," Essential Resolution?
","Twenty-year old Boston `southie' Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is madly charismatic and absolutely intelligent and understanding, but is, at the same time, a loose cannon; a roughneck-psychopath who lashes out at the nearest target.  And while that may be the stark, conflicting, didactic point the film is making, it also serves as its weakest element.  So what if he `finds himself' at the end by hugging Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams)  he's still a presumptuous and brazen maniac with severe psychological problems (and a societal mutineer that's half humanitarian, half dipsomaniac).  I don't think he especially meets his match in McGuire  he just gains a friend with a solid foundation that only points part of Will in the right direction. Hunting has a photographic memory (he's like Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character without the autistic disorder, or Little Man Tate), and can solve problems that only frustrate Nobel Prize winning mathmaticians.  Eventually, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau (Breaking the Waves' Stellan Skarsgard), who saves him from a jail sentence, and he is introduced to McGuire.  Now, Robin Williams is one of my all-time favorites, but I didn't like him at all in this film  he plays the role far too cutesy.  I didn't particularly believe his struggle, his stories or his fleeting tough-guy flash.  He just seemed over-emotional and gooey, downplaying his high-strung energy.  Likewise, he could've been brainier and more quick-witted; more of a match for Hunting (their silent chess-game should have been replaced with a shouting match of facts and figures).  On the other hand, Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and tries to help him, is both absorbing and playful (just as she was in Grosse Point Blank).So I have some objections with the film, but it's still, for the most part, a smart, involving story with good characterization. It's got individual flashes of brilliance within an otherwise predictable story.  Apparently, Damon and Affleck wrote the movie years ago, and finally got to see the project made  good for them!  In their defense, the two spin a great underlying theme about the working class, and how straightforward (and thus, romantic) it is to be an unassuming bricklayer.  Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) says it best when he tells Hunting, `You're sitting on a winning lottery ticket -- it would be an insult to us if you're still around here in 20 years.'  I just didn't experience the essential resolution I was, perhaps, supposed to feel by the final frame.",Null,7,14,8 November 2002
Men in Black," Worth Seeing...
","Men In Black is an excellent film, if only for its subtle exploration of our society's paranoid alien folklore.  Every conceived alien conspiracy theory is covered (with the exception of crop designs) and handled creatively, often tying into several neighboring conspiracy theories.  For years, America has murmured quietly about UFO/FBI cover-ups, alien life and the mysterious `Men In Black' who show up asking questions after every unnatural phenomenon  finally Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones give us the answers!An action-comedy, Men In Black accosts the highly-funded yet unofficial government agency, Division 6, headed by Zed (Rip Torn).  There Agents K (Jones) and J (Smith) keep tabs on the sizable alien population of the US and investigate and regulate all alien entities that enter the planet's NYC port, many of which are completely harmless.  Apparently, aliens have lived among us for some time (a wall chart shows a picture of every alien on Earth  among them: Sylvester Stallone, Newt Gingrich and Dionne Warwick). Anyway, while on the job, the MIB agents uncover the deadly plot of an intergalactic terrorist named Edgar (Vincent D' Onofrio) who's on a mission to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies currently residing in New York City.  Thus, in order to prevent imminent doom, K and J must track down the terrorist.Director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family and its sequel) isn't over-excessive with special-effects, chase-scenes or unnecessary explosions  in fact, everything is skillfully placed for a purpose (what a concept!). As aforementioned, the film plays with some pretty ridiculous notions, producing some wicked little witticism (tabloid newspapers are the best source of reporting as far as Jones' character is concerned, while the exhibit at the 1964 World's Fair was nothing more than a flying saucer cover-up). Just remember, reality is often times more weirder that science fiction  Men In Black inclines viewers to side with the conspiracy version of history in a most entertaining way.  Frighteningly enough, some of the scenarios and theories presented in the film can actually be backed up by facts, which could prove a bit much for those already a bit unhinged.  I say see it!",Null,0,0,8 November 2002
Con Air," Junk-food cinema for the Nintendo generation.
","There are two kinds of action flicks as far as I'm concerned  the elaborate, well-thought out vehicles that suck the viewer in with good characterization and worthwhile plots (stuff like 'Die Hard,' 'The Fugitive' and 'True Lies' to name a few recent cinematic highlights in this genre), and the ones that rely on explosions, relentless fight scenes, big budgets and plenty o' effects ('Eraser,' 'Die Hard II,' 'Rambo,' and any number of action sequels).  'Con Air' is wedged somewhere between the two, though closer to 'Die Hard II' -- you sorta care about a few of the characters, but not enough to stand up and root for them unabashed.  Still, it doesn't really matter, because by the final lap Jerry Bruckheimer has reduced the film to action-mockery and Explosions R Us (the same fate 'The Fifith Element' suffered).Bruckheimer, with his late partner Don Simpson, engineered flicks like 'Beverly Hills Cop,' 'Top Gun,' 'Days of Thunder' and 'The Rock'  'Con Air' is more of the same; a film that feels more like an arcade-game than a work of art.  It's junk-food cinema for the Nintendo generation.The star of the show, Nicolas Cage's ex-Army Ranger Cameron Poe, is finally getting out of lock-up after eight years to see his family; imprisoned for defending his pregnant wife in a bar fight and killing a hooligan (personally, froma legal standpoint, I don't see how he could have gotten sent up river, but hey, this is Hollywood).  So, for God-knows-what-reason, he's sent aboard a C-123K plane in the Air Transport division of the U.S. Marshal's Service, a carrier that transporting some of the nation's most dangerous felons across the country to a new super-maximum security facility.  But guess what -- Poe suddenly finds himself mixed up in a carefully detailed skyjacking masterminded by Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (played unequivocally by Malkovich).  And, as you might guess, Poe becomes a reluctant hero, fighting to thwart Cyrus and his band of 'lifers' from massacring everyone on board as the damaged plane careens toward disaster on the famed Las Vegas strip. The criminal superstars are probably the best part of the film: there's Malkovich (awesome in every role he's played), black militant Nathan `Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer who arrives on board encased in custom-made restraints patterned after Hannibal Lecter's in 'The Silence of the Lambs.'The film's most riveting scene comes when Buscemi, the soft-spoken serial-killer, has tea with a little girl who's likely to become his next victim  the little girl and he instead sing `He's Got the Whole World In His Hands.'  Other than that, and a few other scenes, the movie is basically a procession of swift set-ups, oddball characters, spiked colloquy and action sequences.  If you like bright lights, loud noises, guns and explosions  don't miss this one!",Null,0,0,25 June 2003
Jackie Brown," Tarentino Stumbles...
","Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, but based on Elmore Leonard's 1995 bestseller Rum Punch, the ridiculously too-long Jackie Brown is like Pulp Fiction on a weight-reduction plan.  Gone are all the fattening calories like long-winded, witty dialogue, ultra-violence, street-humor, over-the-top character development and good roles for everyone (`Tiny' Lister, Chris Tucker and Robert DeNiro play stock characters with next-to-nothing to do).Let's just say the best thing about Jackie Brown is... well, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), a hard-up stewardess who supplements her meager income by smuggling cash into the US for a gunrunner named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).  Grier, the blaxploitation she-god of 70s tough-cookie flicks, barely misses a step, proving she belongs back on the silver-screen amidst Julia Roberts and Sigourney Weaver.  But Jackson, on the other hand -- I found myself caring less and less about his near-unexciting character!Crime goes unpunished until Jackie is nabbed by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LA detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowman), at which point a cat-and-mouse caper begins.  The cops pressure Jackie to help bring down Ordell, threatening prison if she refuses (Ordell wants to kill her before she does). So, with the help of sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie launches a foolishly daring plan.The biggest problem with Jackie Brown is that Tarentino made a film with `real' salt-of-the-earth characters  the kind of conspiring people you see in local bars who live right around the corner.  Unfortunately, most `real' people we know are boring and limp; certainly less-than-dynamic.  And that's not why we love Tarentino, it's why we love film-makers like John Sayles. But Tarentino himself set us up for this fall  two sensational films followed by an ordinary film?  Let's hope Tarentino has got a heavy brand of cork and rubber in his next bat when he steps up to the plate again -- I'd hate to think of him as a two-trick pony!  At least there wasn't a chase-scene to end the film.",Null,3,6,8 November 2002
