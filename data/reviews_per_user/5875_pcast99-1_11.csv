The Avengers," A very entertaining comic book movie
","There was a lot of hype and build up leading up to this movie for the past few years, and it has finally come and I will say it has lived up to its hype.This movie deals with Thor's brother Loki trying to take over the earth by harnessing the Tesseract, an energy source with immense power. Nick Fury then assembles Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to stop him.The movie starts out a little slow, and the plot is very simple, bad guy wants to take over the world and will do nothing to stop until he does. It's clichéd but still pays off because of the amount of action. The violence itself is cartoon like, so it is safe for all ages.One other issue I had was the Hulk only has two appearances in this movie, but in each he is the best hero to watch and definitely makes this movie awesome. Mark Ruffalo also has given the best performance as Bruce Banner yet seen in movies, he has far surpasses Eric Bana and Edward Norton.Joss Whedon understood this movie is about giving audiences what they want to see with lots of Marvel superhero's in one movie, thrilling action sequences, humor and pure entertainment.This isn't a perfect movie but it is still a lot of fun to watch and even if your not a comic book fan you will still like this film, definitely give this a watch.",9,3,7,31 March 2013
Fight Club," One of the most engrossing movie's I've ever seen
","Fight club is a very baffling film that may change you're perceived outlooks on life and society. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give in my opinion the best performances of their careers, and it's David Fincher's best film to date.The film deals with an unnamed narrator who works for a crooked insurance agency and the dullness begins to eat away at him until he develops insomnia. later on he meets up with a man named Tyler Durden, one of the best movie characters ever. They begin to cause all kinds of chaos to vent their frustrations on society.The writing is very captivating and crisp, and as the movie progresses I completely lost track of time and couldn't get up for anything until the movie was over and literally left me speechless.Some viewers may be confused about the message and the ideas presented will anger some, but it's still incredibly good and the most underrated movie ever.",10,0,0,6 September 2012
No Country for Old Men," Great performances and tense scenes, but the ending angered me.
","I first saw this movie on DVD about two weeks after it came out, and I didn't really know what to expect because I didn't know what it was about. But the first three quarters of the movie was so intense and thrilling that I thought It was going to be a masterpiece... but then the ending came and left me confused and wondering what message the film was trying put across.The main character, Moss(Brolin), ended up getting killed by Mexicans off screen, and I couldn't believe that the Coen Brothers would kill off the main character for no reason and leave the audience wondering what happened.All in all the movie does have a lot of brilliant writing and great acting(especially from Javier Bardem), but the ending really could've been changed.",9,4,6,26 February 2011
Saving Private Ryan," Who would have the nerve to call this film overrated?
","Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie of all time, it beats apocalypse now by a long shot. I've seen this movie dozens of times now and the opening battle scene on Omaha Beach never ceases to amaze me. The realistic war scenes are gory and violent, but that's exactly what our great WW2 hero's had to go through.The acting was great all the way around by all the actors, especially by Tom Hanks. I've seen other war movies but none have compared to this, so why are there some idiots out there who say it's overrated? They obviously are jealous they don't have the talent to create a masterful war film like this.And by the way, I still don't understand why the Academy Awards didn't give this best picture in 1999, the voters to me were obviously paid off by the Shakespeare in Love producers.",10,1,2,26 February 2011
Insidious," An above average horror thriller
","I watched this movie on Netflix not too long ago, and I want to say I do like horror movies but most movies supposedly pertaining to that genre in the last ten years have sucked, so when I heard about the hype I thought it would be very enjoyable. The movie is made by the guy who created the Saw series, James Wan, and I liked the first one but the rest were dumb to me. I was eager to view this, and I wasn't disappointed but I feel the hype was undeserved with some calling this a horror masterpiece and all.The movie starts with a family moving into a house and the young son of the family falls victim to demonic forces and lays in a coma as a result that nobody can explain. Strange things start happening and eventually the parents call in paranormal investigators who explain to them the son is in a dimension called 'the further' which his son is lost in and only the father can rescue him as he had experiences as a child.This movie I felt would have horror clichés, and I feel it was wearing movies like Poltergeist and The Exorcist on its sleeves.But the movie does have a few good genuine scares, and it does manage to build suspense, but I felt the demonic figure in this movie looked a little fake, and the last forty minutes of the movie was predictable and not as good as the opening half.But by all means it's an above average horror movie and audiences will get what they're expecting.",7,0,0,24 April 2012
Schindler's List," A pure utter masterpiece!
","Before I watched this movie I had heard a lot of great things about this movie, that it's Spielberg's best and one of the greatest movies ever made. And I have to say when I finally watched it, this was the only movie I knew immediately after that it was a pure masterpiece of film making. I knew this was a movie about the Holocaust, but I didn't know who Oscar Schindler was, so I had to do some research and saw he saved over a thousand Jews from Auschwitz. The movie started out a little slow, but It focused on different characters to build up depth and development. About an hour in I was so captivated by the realism and accuracy I couldn't look away even though it is very graphic and violent. The scenes in the prison camp were spot on, and each actor in this movie gave a flawless performance. Liam Neeson was perfect in the role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were great as well. I'll end by saying this movie will open your eyes to the horrors of what happened in the Holocaust, but it will also give you a sense of hope.",10,11,16,15 July 2011
The Hurt Locker," A high tension war thriller, very worthwhile viewing
","I've just finished watching this movie and I will say it's one of the most thrilling films I've seen in a while. I also want to say I have a cousin serving in Afghanistan so I do know what it's like to have a family member serving overseas.This movie starts out in the beginning of the Iraqi invasion in 2004 and a bomb squad unit loses one of its members, and it's a very intense and detailed scene. The squad then gets a new leader Sgt. First Class James, who is rugged and somewhat careless of his own safety and doesn't always listen to his teammates, which leads to tensions between the three of them.The movie consists of the three defusing bombs planted in populated areas and each scene is very intense and you get nervous watching the movie and it makes you feel as though you're right there in the field.I think this movie was very well deserved to win best picture and war movie fans will definitely enjoy this film.",10,1,3,16 February 2012
There Will Be Blood," I loved this movie, but I can see why some people wouldn't.
","I watched this movie on AMC a few months ago because of the hype surrounding this movie. It was released the same year as No Country for Old Men and I heard a lot of people say this should have won best picture that year and is one of the best movies of the century so far. I had no idea what this movie was about aside from drilling for oil, so I didn't know what to expect.The movie starts out with no dialog for over fourteen minutes and focuses on Daniel Plainview mining gold and then oil but when they strike oil a young father is killed in an accident and Plainview takes in his infant son.The movie then flashes forward to a now moderately wealthy Plainview being told of oil in a small desert California area and he sets out to buy the land.He then meets a young preacher boy who distrusts Plainview and wants money from him to start his own church, and the two form a lifelong dislike for one another.As the oil fields begin to prosper Plainview begins to get more greedy and miserable and ends up pushing away everyone close to himYou'll have to watch the film yourself to see what else happens but I must say this film has some of the best acting I have ever seen in a movie, Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano completely blew me away and the movie is hard to look away from.That being said however you do have to have patience while watching this movie and those who don't like talkative dramas probably won't like this movie, but I loved it and now consider it one of my favorite films and I do think it should have won best picture over No Country for Old Men.",10,2,4,9 March 2012
Signs," It isn't terrible, but it's still illogical.
","I am going to say I don't hate this movie but to me it is rather bad and the plot has some huge holes in it that some people need to consider before praising this movie.The whole movie deals with aliens that have touched down and are terrorizing Mel Gibson and his family, by the way Mel Gibson in this movie is a lapsed priest after his wife died in a car accident.The idea sounds interesting, but there are huge plot holes in this movie: 1. Water is lethal to the aliens which will kill them by contact, yet the aliens came to a planet covered by 75 percent of water, precipitation is constant and dew settles on corn at night, so the aliens running through the field should have been killed instantly.2. When the aliens finally break into the home the family fleas into the basement, and the aliens that are capable of inter-space travel and cloaking their space ships cannot get through a wooden door.3. After the family holds them off, the next day Joaquin Phoenix opens the door and goes upstairs without taking the ax or any other weapon with him, sounds extremely ignorant to me.This whole scenario is ridiculous but on a positive note the movie does have some pretty good scares and an effective soundtrack, and the acting wasn't bad either.But those things are not enough to save this film for me, but those reading this if you can stand giant plot holes then by all means see this film, but all others it's better to avoid it, watch M Night's previous two films instead.",4,5,9,8 April 2012
Sin City," Cinematic entertainment at its best.
","I first watched this movie on Spike a couple years ago and I was eager to watch because I remember there being a lot of hype put into it when it was released. I have never read the graphic novels it's based off of or any of Frank Miller's works but I still enjoyed this film more than any other film in the last decade.There are three stories in this film and each have brilliant acting performances and thrilling and sometimes shocking imagery. I personally liked the hard goodbye the most. Mickey Roarke completely threw himself into the role and is one of the most bad ass characters I've ever seen in a movie.The movies' visuals are amazing and iconic, and I feel they marketed an Oscar nomination. The action scenes are intense and violent.This is without a doubt Robert Rodriguez's best film and it's guaranteed not to bore anyone.",10,0,1,10 December 2011
Jurassic Park," One of my favorite movies based off one of my favorite books
","I wanna start off by saying I've seen this movie well over a hundred times now and the visuals still amaze me every time. I read Michael Crichton's book about five years ago and it has had the same effect on me as the movie has.People have often complained the movie has no character development and relies on the amazing visuals but I say that aside from the visuals there are some very intense moments of terror and awe that most science fiction movies today lack.And I agree that the character development from the book didn't translate to the film but I will point out that Michael Crichton himself took part in writing the screenplay and supervised it and he himself loved the film so you can't really say it's insulting to the novel.But I will encourage people to read the book before they watch the film or if you've already seen the movie, read the book because it is more in depth and very exciting to read.Both the movie and book are very highly recommended.",10,2,2,12 February 2012
