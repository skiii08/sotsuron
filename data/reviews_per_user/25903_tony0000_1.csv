The Blair Witch Project," Truly Scary
","Funny story: I had just started dating a woman. I suggested we rent Blair Witch Project. I never see 'scary' movies, but I had heard it was scary and vaguely imagined our sitting on the couch and her spontaneously clutching me during the scary parts or my putting my arm around her in a protective way, or something like that. Seemed like a good plan. So we saw the movie. Boy did the paln backfire! I was terrified from beginning to end and had to stop the movie multiple times because I was so shaken. In contrast, she generally enjoyed the movie. So the date went well only in that she ended up cuddled up to me so I wouldn't be so scared. I have come to realize I have a very low tolerance for scary movies, but even then I have to think the movie was awfully disturbing!",8,0,2,16 May 2006
