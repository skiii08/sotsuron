Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just three more facts against this painful movie
","I have read all the reviews about the things people dislike about this movie, and I happen to agree with them all. I just want to complain about three scenes which anyone brought up yet and almost made me feel sick: 1 - Every time the gunganÂ´s king mumbled and gestured spitting all over the place 2 - Starship captain saying 'We are loosing droids... fast' just when RD-D2 and his mates are repairing the ship 3 - Starship captain illustrating the audience that 'The whole planet is a city' when they are arriving to Coruscant (was it too hard for us to guess that one?) The only thing that can redeem this movie is Ayden Christensen getting Queen Amidala to bed in Episode II. Shameful movie. Excuse my english",Null,0,1,4 February 2002
