The King's Speech," An inspiring biopic movie!
","Outstanding! A movie you must see. I saw it online, (yeah, I didn't have enough money to buy movie tickets), and I definitely loved it from the beginning to the end. Well, I'm Mexican, not very informed about British history. But before i started watching it, I read a little about king George VI, so I watched the movie with further information about the King and his inspiring story. One of the things I loved the most about the movie was the performances of Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth, both great actors. And also, the historic context of England in the 30's, the king George V, etc. Historically correct, inspired and inspiring, with great performances... The best movie of the year, and in 40 years, it will be a classic.",10,0,0,13 March 2011
