The New World," Horribly directed and edited
","While it was visually fantastic and the potential was there, the directing and editing was awful. This movie was very choppy with no real way of allowing the movie watchers to tell time, especially at the beginning, nearing the end of the movie you can catch up a bit on the time-frame, but only by the fact that there is child who becomes involved. Once again the potential was there and parts were fantastic, but the directing and editing really were something to be ashamed of. How anyone watching could be entertained is beyond me. The acting on another note was quite well done, so hats off to all the actors as they did quite a fantastic job.",1,1,8,3 February 2006
