Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," pirates are back and better for it!
","I watched the preview last Thursday.I cannot disagree more with one of the reviews which suggested the latest version is a bit dull.On stranger tides is not only better than the last two instalments but nearly as good as the the original.The storyline is lucid,plenty of jokes which made the first movie good,less use of nonsense CGI and absence of two characters actually gives a new lease of life particularly since Ian McShane is as expected just brilliant.Penelope Cruz appears to be hiding in long dresses to hide her obvious problem at that time.All in all the best movie outing for sheer fun since Inception.Its a popcorn movie and does a good job of what is expected!",8,55,106,14 May 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A buddy cop movie from 1800s! What's wrong with Guy Ritchie?!!
","I watched Game of shadows with hope as I enjoyed his earlier outing of Sherlock Holmes even though I am a big fan of the books and TV series. The last movie was different and attempted to modernise the story to keep the interest of the game generation. This one is truly awful! Firstly Both Sherlock and Mycroft are reduced to being clowns at times in the hope of funny lines which just fall flat.The movie is just a buddy cop movie from 1800s and not even a great one at that!Watson played by the directors buddy curiously seems to have more to do than Shelly(yes,that's what his brother Mycroft calls him in the movie!)himself. Whats wrong with British Directors and their obsession with homosexuality! Here there are numerous double entendres and references to gay time with Holmes and Watson! A particularly ugly scene is one where Watson falls between Holmes's legs and they banter!Holmes doesn't wear masks but looks more like a Tranny with his ladies attire with lipstick all over his face.Sadly all these don't even raise a smile which I could have accepted if that was the reason behind everything.The idea that Holmes was a cerebral sleuth is long left behind with the director Guy Ritchie's obsession of slow-motion action scenes. The point is Guy Ritchie had one of the best characters, scripts,etc and didn't need to reduce it to just plain rubbish British crime caper.If the names weren't Sherlock Holmes and Watson, I could have accepted it as a pretty ordinary buddy action movie with some good scenes.This is pathetic!",1,27,54,22 December 2011
Skyfall," Even Bond has to face World Recession!
","After the last outing of Bond with quantum of solace, the next Bond has to be better and it is by a long way! But it is possibly unique among all Bond films to look different and almost resembles a Jack Reacher story than a Classic Bond. The director is different and it shows (long pauses ,scenes which are quiet and with just dialogues, more character development for some characters while some seem woefully short, dark and bleak almost like a Harry Potter movie ), the music directors different and it shows as it has none of the classic Bond soundtrack being played in the background except about 3- 4 times,the title soundtrack is hardly used and many scenes are very very quiet). It was rumoured that Bond Franchise had financial problems with MGM,etc and it shows.Except for one chase in Turkey and 20 minutes in Shanghai/Macau there are no exotic locations,sets or for that matter even gadgets. You wouldn't be surprised if this movie is liked by the older generation as it resembles one of those 70s thrillers where one man takes on the system while being forced to go back to basics (ala Charles Bronson,Reynolds,etc). All in all it is a good movie although for me it is not a Bond Movie per se. I have no idea about the need to make Moneypenny black or introduce some gay elements to Bond/Villain exchanges! Naomi as future Miss Moneypenny is actually the brightest spark in a movie where Daniel Craig really looks old for a Bond role however why the need to tamper with something that is rooted with tradition? Regarding gay tendencies,maybe just a reflection of the Directors liberal streak. Lastly whatever the box office receipts of this movie this has to be the last outing in a Bond Movie for both the Director and Daniel Craig.",5,17,37,27 October 2012
Apocalypse Now," The most perfect version and superb on IMAX! A must-buy for fans!
","I don't rate a movie as a 10 but this is the closest I've come to doing that.As someone who has watched the original, the redux and the 6 hour workprint versions, I can tell you this is the most perfect version of this classic.
Firstly with Dolby atmos and 4K,it looks and sounds spectacular on IMAX save for the first 10 minutes for technical reasons,I'm told.
This version is shorter than the redux but longer than the original at 183 minutes. But importantly, this is the most cohesive and watcher-friendly version.It is not just that some scenes were added but importantly a lot of small changes made to a lot of scenes which makes the narrative smoother and a very pleasing descent into the madness towards the end.
This version makes the entire role of Bob Duvall so so clear and perfect;Brando is given exactly the right amount of scenes and the unnecessary scene with the playboy playmates included in the redux is axed which is perfect for the movie.The french plantation scene is included but edited and added to make it so much more coherent with the story. Some scenes at the last bridge on the river are also edited to show the madness but not drag the movie down.
I cannot recommend more to buy this version for fans of this classic.This for me is a must-buy!",9,6,7,14 August 2019
War Machine," Why even attempt a comedy when you don't have a clue?
","Brad Pitt had the comedic touch in the movie 'Mexican'. He was not too bad in the Coen brothers movie either. Here he is abysmal,lost and just so bad it is depressing. He would have been served well watching Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies to understand how to pull of a silly character who thinks too much of himself.Instead he tries to be funny as in a sitcom and sadly even fails at that. Does Netflix have way too much money to just waste money on such low quality projects? This movie should be shown to all who are in the process of making comedies to understand what can go wrong. Hope Pitt gets a better shot soon!",5,20,45,26 May 2017
Spectre," Bloated,Derivative and barely better than Quantum of Solace!
","How can you making a James Bond film boring? Well,there are very many answers to that question here. This a bloated,over long (last 30 minutes could be chopped off), slow and uninspiring Bond movie which should surely end the association of Daniel Craigs,Sam Mendes,Sam Smith and co from the Bond Series.What's right about it :The opening sequence,intro scene to Spectre and a few light hearted momentsWhat's Ordinary about it: Pretty much everything. Firstly it is bloated and overlong with the last 30 minutes feeling like the last 30 of Terminator Genisys.We all know what's going to happen and just waiting for the sequences to end.Not a good feeling.The title song is a good song although does not suit the Bond Film. Similarly it felt the title sequence was uninspired by the theme and CGI with snakes awful.One of the worst title sequences of Bond films.Editing is the worst possible.Every scene appears to be about 5 second too long making the movie slow and heavy.The usual pace of a Bond movie is missing and all the actors seem slow and uninterested.Acting seems uninspired and possibly uninterested? It felt like an Old Man's Bond movie with all main players in their 50s(??) - the 40-plus but older looking Craig,Ralph Fiennes,Cristoph Waltz,Monoca Bellucci in her 3 minute role,etc The other heroine Lea is a good actress but not suited for a Bond Girl role.Her eyes look sad and full of emotion and just did not have the glamour for a Bond Movie.Pray tell me,why are Daniel Craig's suits and shirts so tight except in the last scene which was a proper Saville Row suit.Why was the theme song or even the Bond theme not used in the movie except in about 3-4 scenes.The rest of the time it is some loud action sound going on all the time?! This has to be the end of the Collaboration of Sam Mendes and Bond Movies.This is an ordinary Bond Movie and barley better than Quantun of Solace but barely. The gold standard still appears to be Craig's 'Casino Royale'.",5,13,36,2 November 2015
