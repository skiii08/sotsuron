Blade Runner 2049," The most interesting part of the movie was...
","...the return of the giant Atari sign from the original Blade Runner.OK, quick story synopsis. Bones found of a Replicant who's given birth. How was it possible and where is the child (now adult)?I'm sorry, but having waited 35 years for this movie it just didn't press any buttons for me. It's an hour too long, the story-line is weak to non-existent and doesn't get answered, the theory of Deckard's origin is again teased at but not answered (even though there really is very little in the original to point to him being a repilicant).This is another SFX over substance movie. Looks good, although very dark in the 3D version, but there just doesn't seem to be the energy and edginess of the original. It all seems too NICE. Having seen the original movie over 30 times, I'm not sure I'll bother returning to this new story. I have to agree with Rutger Hauer about trying to add to a perfect movie.",5,305,578,7 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," One of the best films in ages.
","From the opening scenes, I realised that this film was going to be something special.  Having been disappointed by such films as T3 and Bruce Almighty, it made a change for a film to live up to it's billing.The special effects are stupendous, and used to move the film along, rather than carry a poor script.  The end fight sequence moving between the shafts of light is superb.There are many laugh out loud scenes, and at no time does the film slow down.  Well paced and well written, I can only hope that any future sequel is as good.Recommended for all the family, this is a definite 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,16 August 2003
Armageddon," Why the harsh words for a GREAT film?
","Sorry, but I read many of these comments and wonder if it's the same film. Everyone I know considers this one of Bruce's best films.  He's finally playing the lead without all the usual macho crap.An asteroid heading for Earth (not new), only one possible chance for survival (again, not new), a bunch of weirdo's from an oil rig to save the world (new!)Who can watch the scenes during the NASA medical checks without laughing, and who can watch the end without a tightening of the throat?  My girlfriend recently turned on the TV 15 minutes before the end of the film and was still in tears at the finish!All in all, a really good film to kick bad and relax with.  If you want Bruce running round shooting people, rent or buy practically any other film he's made.  If you want to see him actually having to act for a change, get this and ENJOY!",9,1,2,10 June 2003
Alien vs. Predator," Alien3 is a masterpiece compared to AVP...
","Bad script, bad acting, characters who you don't care if they live or die, enough plot holes to sink the Titanic in, and extreme boredom until the last 10 minutes.If these are the type of things you like in a movie, go watch AVP. It is truly awful. How this ever got past the test screenings I'll never know.None of the characters in this film have anything approaching the type of on-screen pull that the original Alien crew did, or even the original Predator cast. You just don't care enough about them to be bothered when they're killed. The Aliens are their usual killing selves, but even the Queen seems a bit of a wuss compared to the one in Aliens. The predators aren't as mean as the originals either.If you want AVP, go read the comics. Don't waste 2 hours of your life sitting through this. Get the DVD on rental, cause you sure as hell won't want to buy it!",3,0,1,22 October 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Better than expected, but only if you've read the book.
","In this, the fifth instalment of the series, we find a very different Harry from before. Here, he is beset by insecurity and anger at the fact that he feels people and events are passing him by without his input. Is this normal teen angst or possibly is it Voldermort affecting his thoughts? Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix, a fighting force of wizards against Voldermort, but without much success.No one believes Harry about He Who Cannot Be Named returning, and the Ministry of Magic is out to cast doubt on Dumbledore and Harry. To this end they place a teacher of their own in to Hogwarts. Delores Umbridge starts a series of events designed to promote the Ministry and discredit any other view. Harry starts fighting back with a secret series of training sessions in Defence Against the Dark Arts.Throughout this time, Harry keeps getting visions which he thinks are due to his connection with Voldemort, and these lead to a spectacular ending involving a fight between the Order and Voldermorts Death Eaters inside the Ministry itself.Now to the actual film. The beginning is so disjointed, with jumps from scene to scene without any follow-up that at times it becomes difficult to follow. Many story lines are shown as annoying spinning headlines from the Daily Prophet newspaper, and so much of the book is cut from the first half that several people sitting around us in the theatre complained that they had lost the plot within the first 45 minutes.Fortunately, the last half of the film is more stable but there are so many changes, scene swaps, plot losses and more that as a stand alone film without having read the book, I'm afraid it just doesn't make the grade.Far better than the Goblet of Fire and a good attempt to fit an 800+ page book into under 2 1/2 hours, but because there are so many things happening in the books that don't appear in the films, I'm concerned that book 7 might throw some spanners in the works as to the things that have been skipped.",7,0,1,14 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Very good, but better editing could have made it much better.
","A superb 4th movie here. Darker and more scary than the previous three, but it could have been so much better.There are several places throughout the film where comments are made that seem to make no sense, obviously because a preceeding scene has been cut. Hopefully this will be sorted in the DVD release.So much of the book has been cut though, and several things that occur in future books have been overlooked (How are they going to blackmail Reeter Skeeter in the next film, when in this one her secret isn't revealed?) In future, and especially The Order of the Phoenix, they MUST do it in 2 films to preserve the great story, rather than cutting half the book as they do in this one.Overall though, another good film, worth the wait.",7,1,2,23 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," All the feelings of a wet handshake
","After the 'first' two films, I admit I wasn't expecting too much, but the hype had me hoping. Unfortunately, I was right to not expect anything above the others.The two main problems with this film are that, firstly, none of the characters have any sort of life in them. They are such mediocre people with no warmth at all. Even the love scenes are cold and distant. The second problem is the script. It's awful. Some of the lines that the characters say are so corny and cringe-worthy that you can't believe they were written by the same person that wrote the original trilogy.The SFX are, as always, stunning. The fight sequences are well worth watching. Unfortunately neither of these can make up for the rest of this disappointing film.Go to see it, just to complete the series, but don't go in expecting anything as engaging as the originals.",6,3,6,22 May 2005
V for Vendetta," An astounding film.
","Having never read the graphic novel I went in to the theatre without to much idea of the film. All I can say is that it is a stunning piece of work, and certainly the best film I've seen in the past several months.Hugo Weaving plays the V character to perfection. Verbose upon first appearing, his quotes from Shakespeare always seem relevant. V is an unknown, we end up knowing barely more at the end of the film than we did at the beginning. He is a fighter for what he sees as justice, but understands that his actions are based on hate and revenge. It's what makes the ending so good (keep a good eye on the screen during the final shots!) Into his life comes Evey, a girl with a past who is just trying to make her way in the totalitarian state that is Britain in around 2040. She helps him see his feelings clearly for the first time through a series of meetings and actions that keep the film running smoothly.This is not an 'action' film but a curious type of love story that grows using the backdrop of overcoming a fascist government. Well acted and scripted, I was glued to the screen throughout.Special mention must surely go to Stephen Fry, who's character, like the man himself, seems outwardly happy and sure but hides a soft and easily hurt interior. John Hurt as the megalomaniac bible bashing dictator also makes it one of his best parts for many years.All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to kick back and enjoy.",9,3,9,20 March 2006
