The King's Speech," A Seamlessly Layered Multi-Faceted Visual Experience
","Tom Hooper's extraordinarily self-possessed crowd-pleaser conveys by way of true cinematic form the account of a man duty-bound to speak to the world with a speech impediment. It must be excruciating enough for one who stutters to address another individual. To handle a radio microphone and know the British Empire is taking note must be a nightmare. At the time of the titular speech, a quarter of the world's people was in the Empire, and naturally they'd be listening, including Germany, with special interest.Britain was going to war with Germany. King George VI's spectators needed resolve, precision and tenacity, not hesitant trip-overs disrupted with angst-ridden silences. This was a man who never sought to be king. After the death of his father, the throne was to succeed to his brother Edward. But Edward relinquished the throne to marry the woman he loved, and the responsibility fell to Prince Albert, who had grappled with his voice since childhood.Hooper begins this thoroughly pleasurable film with an aesthetically top-notch point-of-view sequence of Albert, struggling to open the British Empire Exhibition in 1925. Before a packed stadium and a radio audience, he clutches in misery to make the words emerge correctly. His father, George V, has forever deemed 'Bertie' a cut above his brother, though bewails the establishment of media, which entail a ruler to be seen and heard on broadcast events.The triumph of the film comes, as far as I'm concerned, centrally from invariably being with and inside the king. Sensitively, we devote a vast amount in the character, and that understanding is delicately pushed along by using remarkable visual compositions. Wide lenses are used very close to the actors' faces to exceedingly evoke their and our emotional response, camera movement and lighting makes it persuasive and keeps us betrothed to the fearful ruler. Not only do I honor the audacious framing choices that visually share Bertie's discomforted struggle speaking, but there is also exquisite regeneration of the look of early color stocks.At that 1925 speech, we see Bertie's wife, Elizabeth, her face beset with pity. As it grows apparent that Edward's fixation on Wallis Simpson is incorrigible, she realizes her Bertie may meet more public disgrace. He sees numerous speech therapists, one of whom tries the old marbles-in-the-mouth custom. Nothing works, and then she finds an unsuccessful Australian actor named Lionel Logue, who has set up a speech therapy practice.Logue doesn't realize initially who is referring to him. And one of the focuses of the film is Logue's way of behaving toward crowned heads. He proposes to Albert that they speak in unceremonious terms. Albert has been reared within the majestic vacuum of the monarchy and take offense at such conduct, not because he has an eminent view of himself but because, well, it just isn't proper. But Logue understands that if he is to become the king's counselor, he must first become his acquaintance.This handsomely produced film is abounding in period nuances and fastidious class differences. Director Tom Hooper makes fascinating choices with his locations and visuals. The movie is mainly shot in interiors, and most of those spaces are an impressively rendered composition overlapping the constricted with the expansive. That's extraordinary in historical dramas, which highlight scope and splendor and that. Here we have elongated passageways, a bottomless and tapered master control room for the BBC, rooms that appear markedly geometric.The film mainly interests the actors Colin Firth, reserved and polite, and Geoffrey Rush, generous and outgoing, in psychosomatic labor. Helena Bonham Carter, who can be hardhearted, is here alive with benevolence, discretion and affection for her husband. This is the woman who became the beloved Queen Mother of our time, living to a hundred. As the men have a scuffle of self-control and spirit, she attempts to iron the situation. And in the broader realm, Hitler finds supremacy, war nears, Mrs. Simpson devastates, and the feared day looms when Bertie, as George VI, will have to address the world and wage war.Hooper's handling of that loaded scene is virtuosic. Firth interjects his anxiety and keeps the obligatory, virtually British-patented fortitude in the face of adversity, while his personnel and family are frightened on his behalf as he strides toward a microphone as if were a gas chamber. It's the one scene in the film that must come off, and it does, and its poignant effect is astoundingly deep. Finally, what we have here is a first-class historical drama and a commanding intimate one. And two contraries who stay confidantes for the remainder of their lives.The R rating concerns Logue's use of expletives. It's absolutely incomprehensible. This is an outstanding film for children and teenagers whose parents will blindly follow that they should forbid their kids from seeing it and let them see RED and the Twilight saga instead.While I'm raving, I might as well add that I think it terribly sad to find criticism of Danny Cohen's cinematography on message boards on grounds that it doesn't follow basic rules of composition. It's not common to find a film that merges all aspects of the world it creates into such a seamlessly layered multi-faceted visual experience. Quite close to every film we see is either shot in wides for epic scope and majesty or from the small-scale voyeuristic perspective, and even on the rare occasion that a film does both, it's at any given moment doing either one or the other. By that token, one might go as far as to say that most films fail to capture half of the story they depict! That is, by the standards set by this transcendent picture.",10,0,1,14 February 2011
The Mask," A Candy-Coated 1990s Madcap Patchwork
","I guess the reason why I liked this movie so much as a kid can't be safely detached enough from the reason why I found it so pleasant revisiting it on a whim. So I'll just get it out of the way now: Yes, I still get choked up when Stanley's dog Milo cries for him outside of the jail. OK? There. But it's not just that. It's that this dog, really named Max, is not just a prop; he's a bona fide character. Few movies have taken it upon themselves to really give the dog something interesting to do, but this dog not only emotes to tear jerking effect but also performs exciting unexpected feats, following the bad guys' car, intercepting the mask from the bad guys, all done to please an audience of children, of course, but nonetheless done exceedingly well to that end.The opening shots of The Mask give the impression they were recovered from a distraughtly shoestring 1950s sci-fi movie. Marine salvage operations bring about the breakage of an antiquated trunk that's lay for lifetimes on the bottom of the cove, and a peculiar wooden mask drifts to the surface. Shortly thereafter, unhappy bank teller Stanley Ipkiss, an amiable geek played by Jim Carrey, is gazing into the murky waters after a frenzied night of embarrassments. When he glimpses the mask drifting with some debris, he for some inexplicable reason thinks it's a man in trouble and jumps in to save him. All he retrieves is the mask.Metamorphoses are naturally the heart of comic literature. Billy Batson yells 'Shazam,' Clark Kent scurries into a phone booth, Bruce Wayne slides down the pole, and invariably an inconsequential pushover befits a comic-strip hero. No wonder pubescent kids react to these stories so fiercely. Think about what happens to Stanley when he dons the mask. He's instantly changed into a delirious cyclone of aggravated liveliness, clad in a banana-yellow zoot suit, a intersection congealing the Joker, Aladdin's genie, and rudiments of The Shadow.One of the crucial design choices must've entailed the Mask character's makeup. It renovates Carrey's facial appearance into a much bigger, comic-bookish caricature, while all at once the facade is still able to authentically move. The effect is a movie character who appears half genuine, half comic strip. And director Chuck Russell is up to utilizing special effects to shift easily between what might be possible and what is unquestionably not, as the Mask spins like a fast-tempo jazz hydrometer and gleefully triumphs in circumstances that would've overwhelmed poor Stanley.The plot starts with luckless Stanley utterly smitten with statuesque client Tina Carlyle, Cameron Diaz's debut. She trifles with him in the bank while taking clandestine videotape of the vault for her boss, the violent Dorian Tyrel (a quite well cast Peter Greene), who manages the Coco Bongo Club, where, sure enough, Tina's the catlike diva. The plot otherwise features Richard Jeni as Charlie, Stanley's sounding board, who familiarizes him with the charades of the Coco Bongo Club; Peter Riegert as a cop who notes the Mask's tie lookss to be of the same cloth as Stanley's unbelievable pajamas; and Milo, Stanley's dog, who's no less than as cunning as his master.It's also this manic energy and 1990's madcap patchwork that holds together a narrative that is every trace as imitative and baseless as it can be. The art design on the movie goes for the loudest possible 1940s film noir aspects of plenty of superhero comics, and the Coco Bongo Club seems reprocessed from Criss Cross or Out of the Past. Stanley's apartment looks like an adolescent boy's bedroom; all that's lacking is a sign on the outside of the door saying 'No Girls Allowed!' The appearance of the film is as much entertainment as anything else. It's been alleged that one of the crucial traits of an actor is a capacity to share the delight he takes in his performance. You could say The Mask was anchored in that.",8,0,0,17 November 2010
Black Swan," Ruthless Perfectionism
","Clint Mansell tries to root this film's score in Tchaikovsky's classic ballet Swan Lake, though with revolutionary conversions to it. The film itself does the same. Vivid, visually invigorating, reflective, strange, well-cast and mercilessly severe like all of his films, Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is a singular experience, told with fanatical power, superbly and enigmatically bizarre. It fixes on a performance by Natalie Portman that is out-and-out courageous, and epitomizes the clash of good and evil in Tchaikovsky's ballet. Ballet, opera, musical theater, most traditional performance affords itself overindulgence. Ballet is one of majestic motion, of the fantasy of conquest over reality and even the certainty of Newton's laws. But it requires from its performers years of arduous precision, the sort of bodily and psychological preparation that takes control over ordinary life. This clash between the superlative and the real is overwhelming Nina Sayers, Portman's character.Her life has been bestowed to ballet. Was that completely her decision? Her mother was a dancer once, and now bestows her life to her daughter's dancing. They split a petite apartment that seems alternately like a sanctuary and a chamber. They giggle and prattle like siblings. Something seems off. Conversely, the thrilling physicality of dancing is captured in Matthew Libatique's 16mm cinematography, with the psychosomatically unsettling scenes and, especially, the dance scenes.Nina dances in a company directed by the domineering Thomas Leroy. The scope of his self-image is indicated by his present season, which will re-imagine the masterpieces (as Aronofsky seems to be doing to the very same production). Having discarded his former lead dancer and lover, he's currently auditioning for a fresh lead. Swan Lake needs its lead to play contradictory roles. Nina is undoubtedly the finest dancer for the White Swan. However Thomas finds her too 'perfect' for the Black Swan. She dances with skill, not emotion.Thomas, the brute, is notorious for having trysts with his performers. Played with threatening overconfidence by Vincent Cassel, he evidently has ideas about the chaste Nina. This generates a predicament in her mind: How can she liberate herself from the procedural perfection and sexual suppression imposed by her mother, while keeping constant to their lewd domestic relationship? There are also rudiments of All About Eve and Dostoevsky's The Double in her relationship with Mila Kunis' polarized character.As much a rousing night terror as it is a mature theater melodrama and a daring sexual initiation for its protagonist, this hypnotically fanatical film will be reminiscent to some of Aronofsky's predecessor, The Wrestler. Both illustrate determined showmanship in the name of a calling, initiating the obliteration of personal lives. I was prompted also of Aronofsky's virtuoso debut with Pi, about a man driven berserk by his pursuit of the complete mathematical expression. Ultimately, his The Fountain was about a man who seems to overcome the whole coordinate system of existence. Aronofsky's characters make no little plans.The focal plot scaffolding of Black Swan are time-honored: backstage enmity, life imitating art, bottled-up rage and painfully submerged lust. Aronofsky floats dissonantly from those trustworthy procedures into the mind of Nina. She starts to confound existential borders. The film opens with a dream, and it becomes apparent that her dream life is adjoining with her conscious one. Aronofsky and Portman track this audaciously where it takes them, into a fever dream blurring the fine line between a performer playing a role and a psychotic succumbing to delusion. The ensuing psychosexual commotion about a single-minded ballerina could've effortlessly been ridiculous and overexcited, but Aronofsky is able to twist those prospects to his benefit, and seldom aside from the films of David Cronenberg have the physiological effects of psychosis and its delirium been so primordially, plainly and roughly described. Polanski's Repulsion also seems a major inspiration in its story of repression leading to madness in a virginal girl.Portman has never played a character this possessed before, and never confronted a larger physical trial. Aronofsky has a way of drenching his stars in ice water, then crashing in for the most candid possible close-up, literally and figuratively. Someway she becomes exaggerated and nevertheless remains in character: Even in moments of excess, you don't spot her acting. The other actors are like dance partners keeping her in the air. Barbara Hershey gives a completely attuned performance as a mother whose love is genuine, whose faults are not intimated, whose own strictness has all been zeroed on the formation of her daughter.The misfortune of Nina, and of countless young performers and athletes, is that flawlessness in one aspect of life has led to forfeit in most of the others. At a young age, everything becomes concentrated on satisfying someone, and come what may it gets clenched that that idol can never be satisfied. One becomes ideal in every aspect save life itself.This sincerely exhaustive conquest has an exquisite climactic peak. All of the theses of the song and existence, all of the analogies of narrative and dance, all of the mystification of reality and trance rally in a striking elation of soaring fervor. There's indeed but one place this can take us, and it does. If I were you, I wouldn't consume too much time struggling to understand precisely what occurs in a matter-of-fact way. Just lose yourself in the moments of muted, temperamental lyricism that yield grandiloquent visuals, in-your-face emotions, and a time-honored soundtrack that gets turned to full volume.",9,1,5,30 December 2010
Changeling," A Seamlessly Persuasive Success of One Rivetingly Acted, Written, Shot and Edited Scene After Another
","This brooding film may not acquire as much credit as it should for the same reason that many films with flawlessly attractive stars do not. Angelina Jolie plays a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles who returns home from her job as a telephone operator one day to discover that her nine-year-old son Walter has disappeared. She has no idea why or how. All she knows is that the last thing she said to him was that she promised that tomorrow they will go to the movies. There is a powerful maternal instinct in Jolie which fuels her performance as a woman who goes through so much. She has a look that does not only evoke glamour and sexiness, but also a relative familiarity with the film's time period. Jolie puts on a powerful emotional display as a tenacious woman who gathers strength from the forces that oppose her. She reminds us that there is nothing so fierce as a mother protecting her cub. She inhabits this woman so deeply and persuasively that the camera is hardly conscious of Angelina Jolie, superstar and Goodwill Ambassador. But then again, there is no actor in this film that is anything but entirely convincing. And then, the camera has the same effect, and we are completely absorbed. And angry.Changeling opens as a typical story of a missing child, but it fundamentally stays outside the structure of a family drama to focus on a portrayal of a woman whose self-determination is seen as a menace to a male-dominated culture. The time and place are sketched as a city that acts towards women as if they are out of control, and defective when they have reservations about the reasoning of men. An assessment that the film has therefore been subject to sexist contempt derives contrast with that aimed at the women of this heavily engrossing drama's 1920s setting, suggesting maybe that attitudes towards independent, career-minded women have yet to entirely disappear in the prevailing years. Our protagonist challenges male-bred social beliefs and pays for it.Screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski carefully chooses not to crack down on the atrocious events involved in the story, favoring to tell it from Jolie's outlook. He sticks close to the facts of the case, something I wish more docudramas would do, because if the story is worth telling, it is bizarre enough that supplementing it with too many dramatized or fictitious aspects would call into doubt its reliability. There is just a handful of points at which, due to the lack of information, dramatization is necessary. But I am adamant that one does not read too much about this film before seeing it. Walk into the theater without any knowledge as to what happens. You know about Jolie's character and you know that her son goes missing. That is too much. Let the film take you on its journey in much the same way it takes her. The experience without preconception is that much more absorbing.Eastwood and Straszynski's seamless succession of one rivetingly acted, written, shot and edited scene after another puts on view that psychiatry became a device in the gender politics of the time, no more than a few years after women's suffrage was guaranteed. While women were no longer second class citizens, further upholding their individualism, mental institutions turned out to be major means utilized by the male establishment to lead to female disempowerment.As a director, Eastwood's continually been a classicist captivated by the decay beneath legends, and his films proliferate in a country's ethical drawbacks, in its outlook on a system's refusal to admit to its blunders, his latest film appears more densely linked to the War on Terror than his openly anti-war films. There is ample material for an analysis of maternal-spiritual displacement, though Jonathan Glazer's Birth never gave into elementary melodrama.Eastwood uses a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of security and contentment which incapacitated the movement toward equality throughout the former half of the 20th century. The closing shot in the film is a three-minute take in which Jolie walks off to ultimately grow to be lost in the crowded street. The camera pans upwards to show miles of city blocks, people walking the streets, cars passing and streetcars along tracks. The amount of visual effects, technical logistics and creative cinematography and production design all of this took must have been grueling, but to us, it is simply the atmosphere taken into the periphery of the experience.",8,7,11,11 November 2008
Love and Death," A Novel Spoof
","Love and Death is a novel idea, because of all the spoofs---Airplane!, The Naked Gun, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, these horrible new ones like Meet the Spartans and Superhero Movie---Love and Death parodies things none of those other filmmakers would think to. The main thread of the plot is framed like a Russian novel with direct hints at Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, complete with imposed philosophical debates, and freely sprinkled across the film are direct send-ups of Ingmar Bergman films, namely Persona and Smiles of a Summer Night.Love and Death is a special, unique film, a testament to the inventiveness of a certain comic mind, when Woody began exercising not only more ambitious experimentation with the comic possibilities of cinema, but also more cinematic ways of telling an actual story, polishing the banana-peel attitude of Sleeper on the journey to Annie Hall, and, like What's Opera, Doc?, an feat of artistic deflating that bolsters the value of art. Woody Allen meets Dostoyevsky, and the two contrast misanthropic viewpoints: The world is a 'big restaurant,' God is an underachiever at best, 'subjectivity is objective,' etc. Allen joins unwillingly and a black drill sergeant hollers at him. Allen's darling Diane Keaton in the meantime engages lovers as the old husband retires to his bedroom carrying a herring.The plot is Tolstoy via Bob Hope, with enough room for Mozart and Prokofiev, Eisenstein's stone lions, pistols at dawn with Harold Gould, reflections on the word 'jejune.' The splendor of Ghislain Cloquet's cinematography is part of the gag. Same with Prokofiev, who is intrinsic to the evocation of Czarist Russia, and yet it gives the film a very lively sound. Splendor can hardly appease the heart of a grouch, however, so Allen gets the noose ready, changing his mind at the last minute to start poetry and, later, revolutionary assassination. Other flashes of sublimity include Napoleon insisting on more cream for the pastry that is to carry his name, and the divine presence that assures safety but flakes out at the last minute.Perhaps the first of Woody's films where God and the meaning of life are linked to the question of whether or not life is worth living. He says to Keaton, 'What if there is no God? What if we're just a bunch of absurd people running around with no rhyme or reason?' To which she says, 'But if there's no God, then life has no meaning. Why go on living, why not just kill yourself?' And then of course Woody, 'Well, let's not get hysterical; I could be wrong. I'd hate to blow my brains out and then read in the papers they found something up there.' Keaton audaciously makes the presumption that if God doesn't exist, then life has no meaning and one might as well commit suicide. Woody asserts that if God doesn't exist, then humans are absurd, and he seems to bow to Keaton's implication, to the extent that he implies that if God does exist, then one shouldn't commit suicide. He'd hate to pull the trigger only to learn that God actually does exist.Such illustrates the film's approach, which is to contrast grave matters with a lively comical disorder. At times that's merely a case of setting up a threatening scenario and assaulting it with a punch line, but Allen repeatedly finds a way to make his point visually. That's not to say Woody isn't still chiefly a verbal comic, because he is, and one of the movie's running gags is a perpetual argument about the philosophical and moral choices continually offered the characters.Allen's idea is a straightforward one. Picture the basic Woody character, and put him in Napoleonic Russia. Raise him to be a 'militant coward,' draft him and send him off to fight the French, and then marry him to Diane Keaton who feels sorry for him because (she hopes) he will be shot dead in a duel. He's the ideal foil for the Keaton character, who always wants every situation both ways, with alternatives. There are dozens of small moments when their looks have to be just so, and they virtually always are. There are tinges of humorous import that could have gotten lost if all we had were the words, and there are entire scenes that play off facial expressions.",10,1,1,30 July 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Portrait of American Bigotry
","Borat! is the funniest film to come along in more than a year or two, and it's also the only comedy I find truly 'shocking.' What I mean is, every time the Farrelly brothers come out with a new movie, critics say it's shocking and the shock value is plentiful and all of that, but when I watch any of the eight or nine movies they've made, I laugh and I enjoy it, but I'm never shocked by anything. When Freddy Got Fingered was released, it apparently was so shocking that a single exodus from one showing was of an epic proportion, but when I saw it, I just found it to be ahead of its time, if a bit poorly directed during its shocking moments, which I think could be what threw audiences so off-guard during those scenes. Borat! not only made me cackle like an idiot, I also found my jaw to be on the sticky, gum- and-popcorn-laden floor, being too fixated on the literally stunning instance of authentic shock to pick it up and reattach it to my face.I will not describe any of these scenes to you because if I do, the shock will be killed, or at least maimed, for you, but what I will say is this: Borat! is unfathomably hilarious. Its dirty, filthy distasteful and purposely offensive humor is what made it a head and shoulders above how funny it would've been had it not been that way. My point is strengthened greatly not only by all the ethnic and country-based slander but also by the practically record-setting amount of nudity in this movie. One thing that takes the movie down a few is its awful unintentionally kitchen-sink atmosphere that makes the film less of an enjoyment for me, but Cohen and Davitian are so hilarious that I dismiss this minor flaw. In fact, Sacha Baron Cohen's seamless accent and clever Middle Eastern-to-English grammatical foul-ups could be what made me laugh the most.I'm not sure I understand the head exec for 20th Century Fox. What he did was limit the theaters playing the movie, because he wasn't sure if the masses were going to get it. More simply put, there's nothing to not get, and also, each of the hysterical trailers produce waves of laughter in just under three minutes before a movie starts than most mainstream, wide-release comedies do in an hour and a half. Doesn't he understand that when your typical present-day audience sees trailers like that, whether they think they'll even like it or not, their curiosity is provoked too much to resist? But there is a lot of speaking out against this movie from all different interest groups. The movie heavily loads itself with rotten Jewish-aimed humor, so people online are all engaging in forehead-vein-throbbing spewings of fury about anti-Semitism, but I'm sorry to say that ignorant as they are, they don't seem to notice all the different last names of the credentials involved: Cohen, Goodman, Levinson, Siegel, Martei, Bernstein, etc. The movie is produced predominantly by Jews, conceived by and starring a Jew that is so Jewish that his first and last names are Sacha and Baron, the most Jewish things I've ever heard in my life. Also, Larry Charles, the director, has directed countless episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm, the HBO show for Larry David, a Jewish comedian who makes fun of his people all the time. The Kazahkstan fallout is all basically a touchstone to go back to. I mean, you'll be stunned at what they do to Jews, but then what they do with blacks, Christian right-wingers, all forms of southern and Midwestern Americans, feminists, gays, fat people, and I don't want to give them all away, but anyway, what drives the film's paper-thin plot line is its goal to offend literally everybody. And that's what's so unoffensive about it. But it is shocking. I'll give it that.",8,3,9,5 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Underwhelming
","The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's version too contemplative and overstylized. In fact, I have very picky comic book fanatic friends who thought it hit the nail on the head. But to me, on top of being understylized, it failed to deal with the interesting facets of Stan Lee's character. The backstory is itemized through flashbacks which are generally in the opening credits. William Hurt's mad Army general took on radiation expert Bruce Banner to revitalize WWII military bio-force enhancement research. Banner exposed himself to gamma radiation, which causes him to transform into a colossal green monster, and the hospitalization the general's daughter, a cellular biologist who was Banner's colleague and, naturally, his lover. Instantly a renegade from the U.S. Army, Banner has eluded them for five years.Not all of us are writers, and The Incredible Hulk is not the sort of movie seen by people who take the existence of a writer into account, but let us really try to consider the dilemma of creating a story about the Hulk. You are taking in hand two different characters: Good- natured scientist Bruce Banner, and the berserk, devastating Hulk, who explodes into flurries of raging onslaught whenever he's annoyed, which is normally because the U.S. Army is more often than not wracking him with automatic weapons and missiles and tanks. There is still the remarkable uncertainty of whether or not Banner is actually cognizant within his Mr. Hyde. In the Ang Lee version, he was, relatively. In this version by Louis Leterrier, director of another disaster movie, Transporter 2, the most sufficient Edward Norton's vague, mostly closed-lipped Banner can supply is that being the Hulk is like an acid trip, and all he can evoke are abstract splinters of events.Ang Lee's disastrously received Hulk was to a certain extent inspired in the way it arranged the Hulk tale into harmonizing clashes with repressive father figures: Betty was dismayed by her father, the general, and Banner agonized as a consequence of the Hulk genes originally created by his father, a scientist who passed them along to his child. In this forgettable by-the-numbers summer blockbuster, Betty, now the consistently underwhelming Liv Tyler, still has significant troubles with her father the general, now William Hurt, owing to his ludicrous campaign to utilize the Hulk formula and generate a line of Hulk soldiers. Throughout the movie, Hurt so rashly and uncontrollably drenches countless square miles of open space in his military capability that one can only doubt if he has a senior officer with anything to say about having to answer for the indefinite mass of casualties of flinging endless fire at the Hulk with an utter lack of any benefit. Even if they did have some effect on the Hulk, how does that serve their cause really? If Hulk is dead, where's the Hulk formula? And again, Betty and Banner are in love, but don't follow through because the whole Hulk issue is a big concern, although I admit to a clever moment that brings enlightening insight to the Hulk story: Banner cuts short his great opening to have sex with her because when his heart rate exceeds a certain point, he becomes the Hulk.The film flaunts an astounding early shot, not so much for any technical virtuosity but really for its exposure to a beautiful locale as we soar above a hill in Rio de Janeiro, seeing thousands of microscopic, colorful shacks crowding each other. After that, Leterrier's movie, unlike his Transporter 2, is not downright bad, for it has a diverting enough plot turn regarding a Russian special ops expert played by Tim Roth whose function is to become the bad Hulk, only with a mutated cranium to boot, and the movie has a clever little device at the end. It is essentially that the movie is so light, shallow, and only entertaining to a similar degree as a Luc Besson film, which, aptly enough is with whom Leterrier has worked on two previous films, Unleashed and the aforementioned catastrophe of a sequel. The fact is Lou Ferrigno not only has a cameo as a security guard but also evidently does the voiced over roars of Norton's Hulk.I have yet to understand why such a capable actor like Edward Norton would not only star in but script doctor The Incredible Hulk. After an immaculate string of performances in Primal Fear, Rounders, American History X, Fight Club, 25th Hour, Frida, and even Death To Smoochy, it is almost as if he wanted a break from doing so many high-quality movies and a walk-through, generic-mean genre pleasure like The Incredible Hulk.",6,1,3,24 September 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Gambling, a Most Dangerous Pastime
","Do you know those kinds of movies where you laugh but you want to do more than laugh, you're excited but you want to jump up and scream about it, you're surprised but you want to just tell everyone in the theater about how surprised you are, and it's so clever that you want to remember every single line so that you can hastily tell all of your friends the best scenes? This is the epitome of that movie. Its script is possibly one of the wittiest ever written. Its story is so tightly knit and full of perfect twists and surprises that the director so gracefully and steadily adjusts extremes in moods for, and the dialogue is so inspired and hilarious, so witty that David Mamet has finally run up against his true competition. The dialogue is so funny because of how literal and nitpicky the characters are with each other, so no matter what situation they may be in, they can suddenly happen into some silly semantics argument. The dialogue is full of clever non sequiturs and human notices and details that it blows most of the silly, pseudo-clever dialogue from other crime films in this vein. It's that type of script that, instead of making you think of who has influenced the work, makes you think that the writer has gone beyond a simple influence and created a style all his own.The direction of the film, while most people will surely say it's inspired by Tarantino, is very inventive and elegant, a bit reminiscent of De Palma if anybody, and the work of someone who is very much a master of mood swings, as the tone of the film swoops and shifts but never throws the movie out of balance for one second. Another thing that's very original and quirky about Lucky Number Slevin is that it is a field day for all minorities: There are black gangsters at war with Jewish gangsters, the boss of which has a gay son, there's an Asian heroine, and something for every other one. It goes out of its way to go against the grain but appeal greatly to gangster fans with expectations.The cast delivers some of the most absorbing and distinguished performances of their careers, especially Lucy Liu, who plays a character the filmmakers must've pathologically cast a completely contrary actress for, playing an eccentric, chipper kook, almost a cartoon, rather than the cold and intimidating dominatrix that's been the staple of her career. Male fanatics of the crime genre, of which there are many, won't be able to resist the idea of Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both playing crime bosses in the same movie, and Bruce Willis playing assassin may be a bit deja vu-inducing but it cannot get tiring. I've never seen Josh Hartnett so entertaining, enjoying every second he has on screen.Lucky Number Slevin is a must-see for any fan of movies. It's a melting pot of pleasure.",8,2,5,3 October 2006
Requiem for a Dream," A Brutalizing Foray into the Vanguard
","I was in the seventh grade when I impulsively borrowed a VHS tape from an older classmate. I knew nothing about it. It simply looked interesting. I went home and watched it. I had no idea how to react. I felt numb. I felt truly horrified and became obsessed by the feelings this movie gave me. At first, I thought this meant hate, but I gradually found myself fascinated by the notion of seeing the film again. And I realized that if a movie can make you feel so strongly, it's a special film. I have seen it a cautious handful of times in the many years since, and it has yet to lose its effect. Incidentally, I owe a great deal of credit to this film for opening a door for me to pursue more, better, powerful films.Much of what haunted me the first time was the performance of Ellen Burstyn. It is rare that we find movies that feature such dauntless, ballsy and absolutely frighteningly real performances. On one continuous level, she is the embodiment of so many million frail, forgotten old ladies with small worlds and big worries but simple pleasures. What gives her a savory glimmer of hope in the story is such a flight of fancy to such a normal, lonely old woman. On another continuous level, the culmination of her character's course into a nightmarish dreamscape is utterly harrowing. There is nothing to be found in the brutalizing climactic sequences that she says or does that is not excruciatingly undergone by Burstyn. Old women don't get many substantial roles in movies, but isn't Burstyn's Goldfarb the call to action for more? Rarely do we get performances this raw, unrelenting and real from anybody.What is remarkable about this landmark gateway for the new century of American film is how emphatically director Darren Aronofsky shows the psychological conditions of his addicts. When they use, a window opens fleetingly into a world where everything is as they dream. Then it slams closed, and life is basically a scrounge for the money and drugs to open it again. Nothing else is nearly as motivating for them. Aronofsky brings a new imperativeness to the drug movie by trying to recreate, through his idiosyncratically personal approach, how his characters feel, or yearn to feel, or are scared to feel.As this down-to-earth nightmare suddenly begins, a widowed housewife is chaining her television to the radiator. It's no use. Her son frees it, and wheels it down the street to a pawn shop. This is a typical visit, we amass. Anything in his mother's house is a conceivable begetter of cash for drugs. The son's girlfriend and best friend are both dependent on drugs as well. So is the mother: to television and sugar. We recall the actors, however remotely. Honestly, save for Marlon Wayans, I had hardly noticed the central cast in any films I'd seen previously. Or at least that's my subjective perception after seeing them in this, to which there's no comparison to the vast majority of the rest of their work, no matter how impressive. Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb is mussy and overweight in her blowzy house dresses. Her son Harry, played by Jared Leto, is bony and preoccupied. So is his girlfriend Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. His best friend Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans, who has minimized all the juice and nerve of his zany personage in the silly movies he's made with his brothers and is just trying to survive in a diplomatic enough way. Tyrone worries, rightly, that he's in trouble but Harry is in more. Burstyn isn't disinclined to play Sara Goldfarb entirely as a disintegrating undoing. Leto's suppurating arm, whipped by too many needles, is like a logo for his life.Aronofsky is transfixed by the way in which the camera can be used to project how his characters see things, showing us some things and withholding others so that we are first submerged into a nonobjective abstraction and then snatched back to neutrality with the chill of the imperturbable real world. As many times as I've seen modern-day visual stylists produce new and innovative camera and editing techniques, those of Aronofsky's, which he has not recycled for his successive efforts, remain truly original and unique. As much as stylistic conventions and easier, more pleasant viewings are important for the sustenance of cinema, its survival depends on mutations and new forays into the vanguard.Aronofsky uses extreme closeups to show drugs immersing his characters. First we see the pills, or the fix, filling the screen, because that's all the characters can think about. Then the injection, swallowing or sniffing because that obliterates the troublesome outside world. Then the pupils of their eyes dilate. All done with intense amplification of sounds. The movie was given the valuelessly ignoble NC-17 rating by the MPAA. Anyone under 17, or over, no matter how young or old, who feels like they may be inclined to dabble with drugs might want to see this movie, which plays like a virtual hell. Many from my own age group have claimed to be much less intrigued by the idea of hard drugs after seeing this film.These sequences are done in fast-motion, to show how rapidly the drugs take effect, and how unsatisfyingly soon they wear off. The intervals flirt with hopeless discomfort. Aronofsky cuts between the mother, a prisoner of her apartment and diet pills, and the other three. Early in the film, he uses a split screen in which the space on both sides is at the disposal of the other. Sara and Harry each have half the screen, but their motions enter into each other's halves. This is an forcibly persuasive manner of showing them alone but together. In an unforgettable ending sequence, he cuts between all four major characters as they lurch toward their irrevocable journey ends.",10,0,1,10 April 2009
3:10 to Yuma," I Realize Very Late the Raw and Real Force of Genius Russell Crowe Is As an Actor
","3:10 To Yuma thrives on the fascinating human chemistry of the two main characters, Christian Bale's unlikely hero and Russell Crowe's intimidatingly self-aware villain. The dynamic between them is so brilliantly indescribable and ambiguous in its portrayal of personality. When you leave this film, a bloody, fast-paced western, you're going to be pondering the subtextual motives of these two characters as a reaction to the unmatchably entertaining and fascinating climax. What you should remember is that we ourselves rarely know the reasons for things we do. Russell Crowe's character is such a richly drawn villain, especially for a western, because amongst all of his ruthless murder, ability to take charge of a vicious, rotten gang, and shark-like expressions is a man with a mind that's aware and open enough that he is capable of surprising himself. The expansive outreach of his character to his opposing company throughout the film just consumes you.The root of the film's expert delivery is the depth and intricacy of the script, which claims solid development to the point where it can be free to to take thematic liberties and create an unpredictable hot-cold-and-lost-in-inconclusiveness relationship between everybody.I was at first turned very much off by the frustrating animal violence early in the film, but I was progressively turned back on. Russell Crowe completely embodies a rugged manliness that suggests that he was born in the wrong era, as if he were a walking museum exhibit. It's almost alarmingly lifelike to see how genuinely he wears his scopically perfect character. The expansive intellect, not to mention the artistic and romantic sensibilities that are filled in around the edges, are not unequal in realism in Crowe's performance. He is making me realize very late the raw and real force of genius he is as an actor and a movie star. Alongside him, there is just no real way Christian Bale can match him. No matter how affecting Bale is, Crowe's villain is the sort that steals the show and pinches for every penny of it. However, the unlikeliness I speak of in Bale's hero is personified unreservedly as a farmer with such a good-hearted nature that he doesn't even recognize his own breaking point, which comes when he volunteers to assist the transportation of Crowe's notorious character to the gritty town of Contention. Bale shows us a tough everyman with a rifle who can carry himself just as well as anyone else despite his bum foot, but traces over him with the sad, innocent scavenging of a lost ego. Crowe and Bale are doubtlessly the best hero- villain coupling I've ever seen in a western.This western is doubtlessly the best American western I've seen in a life. If only they hadn't bothered with the stupid animal violence early on.",8,1,3,12 October 2007
The Sound of Music," The Perfect Musical
","The string between bona fide sweetness and sappy over-romanticizing in movies is very difficult to describe, but Robert Wise's masterful and infinitely entertaining musical epic The Sound of Music is not a minor instance. The depiction of that meager good, true purity, is so superbly played by the supreme cast. There is not one moment where I feel like I'm watching plaster-smiled caricatures that come along with so many musicals. What I cherish so much about this film is its happiness and its meaning, its characters' feet being relatively close to the ground and yet their heads up in the clouds.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been overlooked for being beneath the benchmark of their generation like George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein and others, but it is also unquestionable that their work on this, the perfect musical, have endured the trial of decades for the utter aptness of point in time and situation of the infectious songs that support the dramatic course, that are actually a part of the stream of the story, rather than interrupting it in its path like Singin' In the Rain. And their intrinsic catchiness carries on with both school and professional musical theater in innumerable revivals.The musical numbers work magic visually, as the choreography is sometimes almost logistically impossible, but not in that it uses any special effects. Many musicals would either be much better without the music or much better without the story. The Sound of Music's fun and energizing music is inborn. I would not have the story any other way. It would hardly work.Taking place in Austria's beautiful countryside, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is studying to become a nun but is not sure if convent life is right for her. She's just too musical and spontaneous. Can you blame her? So she is sent to be the governess to seven children, ranging in age from sixteen to five, of an overzealous widower naval commander, Captain von Trapp, played with seamlessly masked resentment by the great Christopher Plummer. Maria and the Captain right away conflict on the way the children are cared for. The Captain has been raising them in keeping with the ethics of military authority, whereas Maria wants them to take pleasure in life as children. In spite of the children being initially naughty and unwelcoming to Maria, in spite of Plummer's overwhelming rigidity, we love them all immediately.Would a Captain whose wife has passed away not find the naval discipline that he'd been living with for so long to be his first mechanism against the pain and heartbreak of his wife's death? And is that not an indirect manner of showing love to his children, by making their lives so strict and systematic that they cannot take the time to reflect on what life is like without a mother? The Von Trapp family is lovingly developed and, as should be the perogative of any story by no means excluding musicals, are the footing for the rest of the story.The reason The Sound of Music works so wonderfully well is because we are lost in the same perfect world with this unique but natural little family in which love, music and beauty are one, and then when the outside world doesn't slow down for them, we are there with them.",10,3,10,12 October 2008
Marie Antoinette," A Very Good, Oft-Misunderstood Act of Sympathy for Perhaps the 1st Victim of Antagonizing Celebrity Misrepresentation
","Like Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation, this follow-up highlights the isolation of being a woman and bounded by a world that understands how to exploit you but not how to appreciate and understand you. It demonstrates Coppola once more capable of extracting interpretation from actresses who are hardly ever compelled to express it. Kristen Dunst uses an innocent passivity as the title character, as a 14-year-old Austrian princess who is basically bought and traded to the French court to connect with the naive and oblivious Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) to manufacture an heir. She has self-possession, composure and cheerfulness, and they are limited to a world that provides her no manner in which to gainfully convey them. So she clowns around and spoils herself, contained by a bubble of harsh and unyielding royalty's code of behavior. Greed and isolation can breed arrogance, ignorance and lack of empathy.I know what many who have yet to see it probably think, and this movie is not instructive and comprehensive regarding the real government of the era. That is for the reason that we are exclusively inside Marie's world. And it is enclosed within Versailles, which excludes all peripheral certainty. It is an independent structural land mass that shuts out affairs of state, realism, destitution and the general public.Schwartzman portrays a sexually unreceptive pout who would more willingly offer condolences than assume an operating position. Danny Huston is amusing as Marie's older brother, introduced from Austria to gently infer to young Louis one or two essential hints on the subject of a little thing called sex. Horndog Louis XV played aptly by Rip Torn in a hilarious casting choice, would without a doubt need no encouragement to have sex with anybody, as his mistress, a madame played by Asia Argento (another daughter of a famous director) instantly discerns.Coppola does something I like very much, which is making use of setting to characterize the existence and personality of the characters. Permitted undivided admission into Versailles, she illustrates a civilization neurotically committed to the pampering of Marie Antoinette. Coppola's film has been passed judgment upon by some for her application of a modern pop top-lathering, mainly the emo pop rock soundtrack, but also inconsistent dialogue, jarring infringement of characteristics of the modern world superimposed upon 17th century France. But no one in the movie lives in 17th century France. Several people in historical movies appear in some way conscious that they are living in the times of yore. Marie gives the impression of a modern-day liberal-minded teenage girl, which sure enough she is, and the up to date pop allusions tempt the audience to share her what-the-hell attitude with ours, or should I say let-them-eat-cake. Shakespeare mixed eras, too.All criticism I have gathered of this film's respectable enough but quickly faded reception could easily alter its breakable sparkle and relegate its dreamy and heartbreaking affection for the real Marie Antoinette to the rank of an informative depiction by misunderstanding its unconventionality. However, its falling off can be mostly attributed to the common marketing stupidity in that few theaters in fact showed the movie on the publicized release date. In the face of the fact that the trailer presented a release date that was inevitably assumed to be nationwide since it said nothing of limited release or select cities, the movie only went to big cities on its opening weekend and in select theaters at that. It abstracted almost a month for it to trickle down to the majority of local cinemas and by then too much time had gone by for an adequate turnout. Everyone knows Marie Antoinette was guillotined and we expect her gruesome death with an unpleasant interest. Coppola skillfully circumvents a decapitation, and stays away from overstuffed riotous mob scenes by using light, sound and a balcony to manage Marie's execution as a curtain call. As she was made by the aristocracy, for all intents and purposes, to take the part of a princess, she is naively loyal to her imposed function.It is not needed to know anything about Marie Antoinette to get pleasure from this movie. Some of what we think we know is mistaken, as she was perhaps the first victim of antagonizing celebrity misrepresentation and today's interpretation of history has a lot of its residue. As maintained by Coppola's rendering, she never said, 'Let them eat cake.' 'I would never say that,' she defends angrily. What she says is not 'cake' but 'custard.' But, in spite of what you would think, the more you know about her, the more you might realize, as Coppola's sideways approach alters the poise away from practicality and into an undertaking of compassion for a sensitive, free-spirited person imposed upon by things and people that deserts her natural need for individual freedom outside her high-society surroundings. Prior to being a queen, prior to being a hostage to fortune, Marie was a young girl coerced from her home, stripped naked, and scrutinized like a commodity. It is beyond belief with what lack of interest or concern for her feelings the court lords and ladies exploit her for its gratification and decadence, and from our reaction to this film and the inevitable thought of her death, we then perceive with a strong sense of injustice that in exterminating her they disposed of what little guilt of which they were capable.",7,0,1,14 September 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Kiss Me Deadly Around the World in 80 Days
","This cultural legacy is still a movie of splendid imagination and swift pace that clutches you with its very first playful image, dashes you through a progression of remarkable escapades, and drops you back in reality two hours later with a juvenile smirk. This movie commemorates the stories we exhausted our youth plowing through in comics and movies, where the hero gets out of bed wondering what intrepid feats and shocking terror he'll be surviving in the next couple minutes. And indeed, it marks off the rainforests of South America, the surroundings of Tibet, the barrenness of Egypt, a clandestine submarine base, a remote island, an ancient cryptand an American archaeology classroom. Our hero tangles with vicious Nazis, slippery gravediggers, inebriated Sherpas and devious Frenchmen. It all culminates in the literal wrath of God, building to that dazzling meltdown with tarantulas, boulders, spears, falling rock, flaming airplanes, runaway trucks, preserved tombs and of course, snakes, all the while riding horse carts, biplanes, motorcycles, submarines, ships, trains and trucks.Indy and Marion outlive a chain of ghastly snares, tricks, surprise attacks and doom worse than mortality of which Lucas, Gordon and Kaufman propose numerous, Karen Allen equaling Ford bit by bit through the film's romantic, comic and action-tilting requirements: A drinker and fighter, Marion is promptly established as no measly damsel in distress. And one chase features a truck, three jeeps, a horse, a motorcycle and a tremendously arduous stunt in which a character must achieve a 360-degree rotation of the racing truck. All is realized with the touch of a master entertainer at the helm, merging stunts, visual effects, painstaking technique and pure sweat. The crucial bounty sought by Jones, Belloq (Moriarty to Indy's Holmes), the U.S. government and the Nazis alike is the Ark of the Covenant.Two elements make this defining film more than merely a triumph of spectacle: Its sense of humor and the quaint stylishness of its characters. This is time and again a hilarious film, the biggest laugh coming from the ancient and obvious gag involving a sword and a gun. And to the standard of the 1940s' Lone Ranger, Dick Tracy and Flash Gordon serials, the personalities of the crucial characters are extremely charming. In this first outing, Ford creates an aloof, modest, persistent character.Raiders of the Lost Ark is like the dieselpunk successor to The 39 Steps, Saboteur and North By Northwest, relentlessly putting the action in adventure. Lucas' idea was to imbue with fresh energy an old dramatic style, with its thrill-seeking, sharply winding composition always building to exciting release. It takes us back to our youth. Virtually all summer movies today attempt that, but it's easy to become immersed in today's dime-a-dozen blockbuster dreck and forget the true profundity of difference between saying that about a mediocre film and about a Spielberg film, the Indiana Jones phenomenon in a very distinct way. Today's Armageddons, Snakes on a Planes, REDs, Fast and Furiouses, Wild Wild Wests, Sucker Punches, Die Hard 4's, and yes even Indiana Jones 4's try to achieve their errand by being childish instead of childlike. The original Indiana Jones trilogy, beginning here, is the quintessential template.Ford brings every scrap of his terse appeal and physicality to his Indiana Jones, a reserved professor who releases his inner gallant in vigorous quest for fortune and glory in precious artifacts that belong in a museum. One of the moments that connect us to Indy is when he's slipping off of the side of a bottomless pit, having hardly caught hold of a root protruding from the earth. Spielberg cuts to a close-up of Indy, smiling in respite, but when we go back to wide, the root yanks out of the earth and he's about to fall into the void. That close-up unites us with Indy, that momentary 'Whew!' amidst all the chaos.Spielberg gives dutifully focused meticulousness to clever and resourceful action sequences, scored with exactness by John Williams. The stunts, photography and editing so conscientiously applied to the myriad chases and scuffles are the gauge for action-adventure films since in their lucidity and vigor. The quest is the whole, with Jones showing his nerve, but ultimately meeting consuming powers with wonder and humility. The religious tinges and sweeps against mortality are crafty pickings on the part of Spielberg and Lucas. They know moviegoers want to lose control and get excited, to devote themselves to a story not just to defer disbelief, but to believe. Reality can hold its horses for now.Raiders endures for numerous reasons, not least of which is due to Spielberg's supreme dexterity as a visual storyteller and his knack for finding electric performances in his actors that nevertheless slip right into the whole cacophony. His style is masterful, and yet invisible. Every individual set piece is breathtaking in its tempo, joke delivery and emotional upshot. The scene in Marion's Nepalese bar begins with a beefy drinking game. This is promptly trailed by some romantic friction as Indy returns to her life and they parley over a supposedly missing relic she might still possess. Eventually, Nazis arrive led by a dark, goggled, panting sadist. The action that ensues has everybody giving the mortal skirmish their all, but it's all the punctuating details that make it unforgettable, bullets puncturing a barrel of whiskey and Marion leaning over to guzzle some before it spills, Indy wrestling with a brute whose arm is aflame, and the Nazi ringleader ordering his machine gun-wielding henchman to just shoot them both. Unlike most present-day action films, Spielberg crafts dynamic pictures with diverse on screen action.",10,1,2,28 October 2011
Spartacus," Nice Look Back On 1960s Technicolor Lushness
","Spartacus is a Roman epic with Laurence Olivier in one of the greatest performances I think I've ever seen. It's also an ambitious early vehicle for Stanley Kubrick. And, it's an important point in cinematic history because it was the first film to openly defy the black list by using the work of blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, and billing him. The most entertaining thing about it, aside from Olivier's fierce, intense, and successfully infuriating performance, is the dated look of the lavish and obviously fake sets, the bright and blown out Technicolor cinematography, the opening slave revolt and the costumes and weapons and firetruck red blood. It's a movie of the times. It also marks my confirmation that Laurence Olivier is a brilliant actor. He draws such an intimidating facade for his prideful and puerile militarist, hiding his weak fear for humiliation in his battle for power against the truly confident Gracchus. I have seen Olivier in Sleuth, in which he gave a wonderful performance, but he didn't shoot to the top of my list as he does here.",8,3,4,21 December 2006
United 93," To Watch This Movie Is to Be Met Head-On BY the Miserable Anarchic Actuality of September 11, 2001.
","The reason Paul Greengrass's intensely unsettling docudrama is so potent and effective is because it does not play as if to know that any time has gone by since any given second of the unspeakable events of 9/11. The entire film, every facet, exists on screen in the most immediately present tense. The dialogue, which is generally improvised based on rehearsals Greengrass held with the cast, is anchored in interviews in the flesh between actors and families of those they play. Hardly of the passengers in the film are alluded to in any manner by their names, a touch gives light to the alliance rather than any distinct gallantry.This momentous cultural, artistic and historical achievement makes a measured endeavor to steer clear of not only name actors, but actors with whom we are really even very facially familiar. In a sense, the film takes more chances as a narrative than it does as a dramatization of 9/11, because it makes no effort to depict the passengers or terrorists with exposition or backstory. In most movies about ill-fated journeys, we meet a handful significant characters like the selfish businessman, the quiet, surprisingly heroic man with a skeleton in the closet. What we discern about the passengers on United 93 is just what we would know if we had been on the plane and sitting near them: Nil save for one or two fine points of physical appearance.Screen time aboard the plane interchange with time spent inside the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, air traffic stations, and a military room. Here, too, there are no histories, but experts thinking and communicating in the immediate. Numerous of them played by the actual people involved, they have an unprecedented expertise of jargon and courses of action. When the controllers see the second plane crash into the World Trade Center, they flinch with disbelief and terror, and that instant in the film feels as real as it felt to me on that universally eery day, no matter how normal it was in terms of my own routine and everyone else's in spite of all the cataclysmic new chapter of history building in the background of the day.This gut-wrenching masterpiece of tension is supremely overpowering because it gives a picture of all of its characters as just anyone shut into an inevitable advance toward the end. Oscar-nominated British director Greengrass's disturbing docudrama includes no politics. No speculation. No private dialogue between anyone on screen, and so of course there aren't any jingoistic pro-America monologues. The film pathologically avoids the big picture.We watch United 93 as the passengers and crew get on the plane and it gets ready to depart. Very soon, the first plane is engulfed by the ominous flames in the World Trade Center. Living in that flash, we share the bewilderment of the air traffic controllers. There is a thin silhouette of assorted procedures that come into focus, deliberately without expansion or analysis. I am one of the many who see this film and recall the now infamous scene in Fahrenheit 9/11 in which George W. Bush sat inert in a kindergarten classroom in Florida for seven minutes after being informed of the attack. We see the reality that he's informed, so what was he waiting for? This, a taut, spare dissolution of its events' primordial cognizance does not reach for that understanding, because the people on the screen do not have the vista of retrospection.The third act of the film is some of the most harrowing cinema I've experienced since the first time I saw Requiem For a Dream years ago, as the last twenty minutes concentrates on the despair aboard United 93, when the hijackers have taken over, hack flight attendants, slay the pilots and ostensibly have a bomb one click away, the passengers erratically overcome their fear and attack of mortality and bind to rush their victimizers, all having been reconstructed from the 33 telephone calls from the plane and from the cockpit voice recorder. Greengrass is bursting to be as truthful and precise as possible. There is no fabricated showboating, no dramatized arguments among the passengers, no specific champions. The passengers are a horrified assembly of strangers. Even while these courageous passengers spend their last minutes fighting tooth and nail, we know nothing about them, none of the information about them which we can of course look up now. It could be us on the plane, petrified and alarmed.",9,2,4,30 November 2008
Deja Vu," Aw Man, Tony Scott's Toning Down
","As opposed to the growing ambition, heart-stoppingly violent tension, and grandiosity in what Tony Scott's been leading up to with his past two movies, Man On Fire and Domino, is deflated with Deja Vu. Deja Vu is just another action thriller about a cop and a bad guy, an interesting twist and an 'unexpected' love interest, corny comic relief tech teams and a PG-13 rating. I wanted more out of it, because ever since the final credits started rolling for Domino, I was expecting Tony Scott's next film to be next to the biggest rush of grunge, sleaze, eye-candy film-making, and music video editing I would ever get from a movie. I'm sure that somewhere deep down I felt that his next movie would have to be a lighter, almost cute actioner, because it's very difficult not to be stabbed with angry words from a studio exec who just flushed millions of dollars on a flop that read 17 or 18% fresh on the Tomatometer, not to mention the amount of cockiness and filmmakers' rebellion that was so aggressively lunged into Domino, a sort-of-biographyish action extravaganza that featured two stars of Beverly Hills 90210 playing themselves as they get their noses broken and later find themselves screaming as they happen to be there when a crazed Mexican is ripping a man's arm off with Tom Jones's cover of Mama Told Me Not To Come blaring over the soundtrack.Nonetheless, Deja Vu is a good, neat little thriller, even if it doesn't pack a punch or feel as twisted and comfortably numbing as Domino, Man On Fire, True Romance, or even Scott's earlier work like The Hunger and The Last Boy Scout. Deja vu might explain the all-too- familiar characters or the never-ending cycle of love interests that just has to lay its turf in every adventure film, action fans will have a decent time with it, thriller fans will love it, and Denzel fans will be making noise in the theater and aggravating the daylights out of the rest of the audience as usual.Washington, who has played this very same down-to-earth yet abruptly raging cop as many times as Willis has played his tough cop, Eddie Murphy has played his wisecracking cop, and De Niro has played his cocky, boisterous tough guy. This is one of the hints that this is just another action movie, because the star playing the tiring staple role for millions of dollars is a key element in most. Who should've gotten more screen time was constantly inflating but never too routine or drudging Val Kilmer. In a film full of actors with not quite enough charm to carry their corn-stuffed formula roles, I would've much preferred him as the hero. With the exception of Jim Caviezel, taking a huge turn as the ruthless, murder-driven villain from famously playing the most kind and decent man in the world in The Thin Red Line and taking the next step to Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ, the rest of the cast is just, well, there.",7,2,4,26 November 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Show Me the Way to Go Home-Bohm-Bohm
","This movie pleases one's spirit. It's alive with ingenuousness, resilience and joy. It's also a hilarious comedy and an adventure. It's like other seminal Spielberg films like Close Encounters and the Indiana Jones trilogy, a movie you can mature and age with, and it'll never lose its luster. It's a story of companionship and devotion, and there's nothing manipulative or anti-intellectual about that. It's simply the personal sentiment of a master filmmaker's inner child. Critics and viewers of my generation, that is to say thirty years after the film's initial release, have been made so scornful by the saccharine lugubriousness of Spielberg's many Hollywood imitators in that time that they are repelled by what they see in this film as the romanticized America that Hollywood and politicians struggle to assure us actually exists. Well why don't we take a break from being presumptuous post-modern snarks and look at what's actually on the screen? Sure, the movie is set in and around a sprawling American suburb. The split-level houses stretch up and down the coiled drives, etched out of hills that become forest just beyond the backyard. But this suburban world, with its unsupervised kids, deeply lonely and depressed parents, busted toys and trademarked snack food, could've come out of The Ice Storm or American Beauty. Except one night in those woods, a spaceship lands, and eccentric little glowing silhouettes shamble through the night, seeking plant samples or whatever. Thenhumans turn up, powers that be with flashlights and trudging boots. They converge on the spacecraft, and it's coerced to desert one of its crew. This forsaken little being is discarded to a horrifying world of dogs, raccoons, car exhaustand nosy little boys.The movie is in effect a psychic autobiography, a picture of Spielberg as a normal suburban kid distinguished by a singularly impassioned, spiritual imagination. The hero is a certain little boy named Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, who doesn't give the impression of a coddled, over-trained kid. He's spontaneous as hell, hypersensitive, plucky and naive. He just knows there's something living out in the garden, and he waits all night with his flashlight, attempting to entice the alien to appear with a universally appealing inducement: Reese's Pieces. They become friends. The E.T. secretly moves into the house, and the movie's midsection is a continual development upon the idea of an extra-terrestrial's induction into bedrooms, TV, phones, refrigerators and beer. The alien has the capabilities of thought transference, and it shares its feelings with Elliott. That's how Elliott understands that the E.T. longs to go home.What's particularly magnificent about all of those moments is that Spielberg builds them out of Melissa Matheson's genuine plot developments. At each point from start to finish, this respected event picture is truly a narrative achievement. It unravels particulars about the E.T. It builds on the behavior of Elliott, his mother, brother and sister. It embroils federal space organizations. It deals with extra-terrestrial medicine, ecology and contact, and it rouses real laughter and sentiment.Much of those triumphs hinge on the extremely weird E.T. itself. Through its strange little waddle, its shrill screeches of shock, its exploratory replications of human tongue and its bizarrely raspy drone, E.T. becomes one of the most endearing imagined creatures in the movies. It's a success of special effects, of course, but it's also one of imagination, because the filmmakers had to conceive of this things, and experience our world through its wholly alien perspective to fashion a being so totally compelling. It's a triumph of empathy. While E.T. is the more obvious and frantic orphan, Elliott is in his own way bereaved of a home.",9,1,2,28 October 2011
Lifeboat," One of Hitchcock's Subtlest Efforts
","'It is the nature of a man as he grows older ... to protest against change, particularly change for the better.' -John SteinbeckIt is movies like Lifeboat that prove the merit of film as an art form, not quite because it is nearly a magnum opus but because it tells a story by John Steinbeck that most would envision as a stage play, and puts it on film in a purely cinematic way. From beginning to end, the entire film is set within a lifeboat in which a group of American and British citizens are stuck after their ship and a U-boat sink each other in combat. A German survivor is allowed aboard after some debate, but could be the U-boat captain. His belief in his vision as inscrutable as always, Hitchcock's pace is steady, consistent, never allowing a dull moment, not to mention does not let his imagination cease and give up his gimmick of appearing in the background somehow.An assortment of American and British civilians scramble into the same lifeboat after their ship and a U-boat sink one another in an attack. Walter Slezak plays Willi, a German survivor, who is hoisted aboard and denies being an enemy officer. During a fervent wrangle, Hodiak's Kovac, the practical enthusiast who shapes the limited, raw material of the lifeboat into serviceable survival apparatus, and who demands the German be thrown out and left to drown. Less flappable aptitudes triumph with Garrett, played by the shrewd and receptive Hume Cronyn, asserting the German's POW status, and he is accepted onto the boat.Kovac is the voice of the bottom-line gung-ho Conservative. Bankhead is the voice of the diplomatic level-headed Liberal. They manage to pull together and survive, even bond, despite their radical differences. Indeed the young nurse played by Mary Anderson is the voice of pacifism. It's about how they deal with the entrapment with the presence of a Nazi during the war, learning to accept the Nazi propensity for amassing as many targets as possible, even if they don't understand it. Bankhead knows foreign language of enemy while Kovac shuts out anything the German says. The charm is that we like and perfectly understand both rivals. Then there is the millionaire Rittenhouse, played by Henry Hull as the rational mediator yanked from left brain to right in moments of mob impulse; the tragic seaman Gus, played by Bendix, the folsky everyman stripped by his wounds and delirium of the horse sense that made his life meaningful.But it is the character of Joe, played by Canada Lee, a black working man, who is the unadulterated temperament is a tranquil control group of the ensemble, as is Slezak's SS monster. Brilliantly placed at completely opposite ends of class, culture and present significance, they both share a common wisdom that transcends that of the other characters. The times when Joe opens his mouth come as a surprise, yet they are more meaningful than the stubborn conjectures of the other survivors. Willi, as it were, could initially have been Steinbeck's most intimately drawn characters. He sees obedience as a gift from his master race to these lower creatures, and surrender as the gift they should graciously reciprocate to him. They are the clay on Hitchcock's forming wheel. And the collective unconscious of them all is the sea.Tallulah Bankhead, more of a fascinating person than a fascinating actress, maintains her enjoyable presence throughout. With all her crudities, doubts and confusions, there is nothing in the world she so reveres as beauty and pleasure, as opposed to Hodiak's manly man who takes charge, rationing the little food and water available, gradually finding his control taken away by the enemy, with Slezak's great unruffled imposition. William Bendix also harnesses his character's sympathetic situation to magnify the tension in scenes of suspense.Due to the careful visual composition of its consistent narrative structure, the mood in the boat is determined by a sense of survival, fueling the film with riveting interest. There is special attention given to the technical film-making in Lifeboat, not because it takes place in a tight space for two hours. There have been scores of films that have done that successfully. It is Hitchcock at the helm that seems to draw attention to its claustrophobic setting. How did he do it without letting it get boring? Where did he place the camera? How did he get that shot? If one looks beyond this inclination, one can see that this is indeed one of those early times in Hitchcock's prolific, indefatigueable career in which his style seamlessly remained hidden to stealthily intensify the story, as it is supposed to be.",9,1,3,31 August 2008
In Bruges," An Erratic Effort
","Contract killers Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the former a clumsy hatchling with easily ruffled feathers, the latter a calm veteran whose patience only intensifies Farrell's aggravation, are sent to the picturesque old Belgian world of Bruges by their edgy, ferocious boss Ralph Fiennes and told to await further instructions. While Gleeson peacefully absorbs the sights and historic buildings, streets and quays, Farrell is pessimistic and finicky, irritated with the lack of local nightlife. From the wild playwright of the feral, hypersensitive Lieutenant of Inishmore, this is a wonderfully enjoyable set-up for an action/comedy buddy crime film. It prepares itself with comic dynamics and quaint atmosphere, just as it markets itself in trailers, but it lets us down with an erratic handling of its tone as a jarringly dark twist in backstory unravels itself. It could have balanced its mood swings if it did not so convincingly set itself up as the duo comedy as which it was marketed.The pace accompanies the tone in the dunce corner, the film's running time being nothing more than filled by the subplot of Farrell striking up a romance with a thieving drug dealer he meets while she is working as a PA on a movie set with a temperamental dwarf actor.There is nothing wrong with a film that gets darker and darker as it unfolds, but In Bruges's missteps lay in its disappointing effect as well as its odd feeling of severing us from it, as despite its beautifully antiquated medieval scenery and occasional moment of fulfilling humor among a promising cast of great contemporary English actors, its struggle with its own contrivance being transparent more than the story's capacity to absorb.By either following through with the spirit of its exposition or helming better control over its landslides into melodrama, it could have avoided being an incoherent disappointment which, if I came across it one day with a lack of better choices, I would still watch again. I sense it as a film that has the potential to grow on you despite its nearly crippling flaws.",9,3,7,18 August 2008
Se7en," A Ballad for Modern Apathy
","A bleak, gruesome, horrific and clever thriller, and filmmaking of a distinguished kind, it tells the tale of two detectives, one all set to retire, the other at the outset of his career, and their efforts to catch a jaundiced but cunning serial killer using the Seven Deadly Sins as his narrative. As the film begins, we meet Somerset, a painstaking veteran cop who lives a lonesome bachelor's life in what seems like a furnished room. Then he meets Mills, an impetuous young cop who indeed requested to be transferred to Somerset's district. The two men probe an exceptionally grisly murder, an obese man having been hog-tied and force-fed to death.His sin was gluttony. Shortly Somerset and Mills are examining similarly creative murders concerning greed, sloth, lust and the like. In each circumstance, the murderous means is fitting, and revolting. Somerset deduces that the murderer, John Doe, is using his crimes to sermonize. The look of this pulp meditation is vital to its achievement. This is a very sinister film, the murk regularly diffused only by police flashlights. Even when all the lights are on in the victims' apartments, they shed merely ashen, despondent puddles of illumination.While the story is present-tense, the set design evokes the 1940s. Gary Wissner, the art director, uses dark blacks and browns, cavernous shadows, lights of sickly yellow, and a lot of dark wood furnishings. And it virtually always rains. In this cutthroat world of darkness, Somerset and Mills move with increasing fear. Somerset perceives that the killer is using ancient literature as a muse, and researches Dante, Milton and Chaucer for clues. Mills opts for Cliff Notes. A leg up comes with Somerset's feeling that John Doe must have a library card. But the stiffs amass, in bitter thickset detail, as terrifyingly vivid as one sees in commercial films. The few twinkles of soul and hopefulness come from Mills' wife One of the most skillfully and innovatively edited contemporary American films, perhaps its most beautiful montage features Somerset in the library researching the Seven Deadly Sins while his friends, the library custodians and guards, share their boys'-night-out loft ritual, with an unexpected blackly comic punch line: When the sequence ends, Fincher hard-cuts to Mills losing his temper at these confounding research materials. The contrast between Somerset's reservedness and erudition and Mills' man-this-sucks horse sense and youthful dopeyness starts to make pretty broad strokes, but there is some charming buddy-cop undercurrent that works without a glitch into the glass sheen of the film's atmospheric tone. It's because Andrew Kevin Walker's script and Freeman and Pitt's chemistry that the film is so moving. For instance, the chasing of John Doe through the streets gives Mills the till-now belated chance to show his bones as an impressive, dedicated cop.The material independently could've been managed through numerous approach, but David Fincher pinpoints suggestive atmosphere, and Walker writes dialogue that especially for Morgan Freeman is judicious, learned and lyrical. Ultimately, it sinks in that the killer's sermon is being urged directly to the two investigators, and that to appreciate it, they may have to imperil their hearts and their psyches. Fincher's fatalistic noir ballad is distinctive in bringing the killer on screen with half an hour left, and gives him a speaking role. Rather than just being the game of a hunt, he's exposed as a warped yet eloquent enemy, having contrived a hideous plan for finishing his sermon.",10,0,1,7 September 2011
I'm Not There," The Whole Really Is Not the Sum of Its Parts
","Todd Haynes's complex portrait is an endeavor to wholeheartedly take into account the paradoxical conflicts and ambiguities of Bob Dylan by fabricating itself upon vast inconsistencies. Haynes's method is to craft six Bob Dylans and use six actors to play them. In this fashion, each Dylan is coherent and unswerving on his own terms, and the existence of Bob Dylan all together need not bind collectively.There are so many Bob Dylans that it is easier said than done to place which ones you like, and on which you look down. I have never followed his work or his career other than finding a small handful of his songs to be catchy, but many people spent years detesting Dylan on the foundation of one thing and then submitted to a change of heart after another thing years later. Rarely has such a publicized celebrity internalized himself so indulgently as to obscure his trajectory and conceal his essence, and ultimately, the masses are left with the work, which is all the creator is truly obliged to contribute to them.What Haynes achieves is the deduction of the heartening parentheses and forays that maintain that everything springs and seems sensible, and to illustrate what is in actuality disorder and confusion beneath the versatile juxtaposition of each strand of the movie. One of the actors is a little black kid who claims to be Woody Guthrie; a second is a Greenwich Village folk singer played by Christian Bale, a third is Heath Ledger, appearing in the same film but never in the same shot as his future blockbuster counterpart Bale, as a performer acting in a Hollywood movie, who takes it easy and starts a family, a fourth is Cate Blanchett curiously in one of her most arousing screen appearances as a folk hero who estranges his followers by changing from acoustic to electric, a fifth is an actor played by Richard Gere appearing in a western about Billy the Kid, a sixth is a Dylan surrendering to a controversial interview regarding his career, and then we double back again to Christian Bale, who plays a purposely skewed agent of ambiguity, either a seventh Dylan or a renovation of the first, now a born-again Christian.No attempt is presented to rationalize how these Dylans are really one whole Dylan, which is the purpose. By fashioning this patchwork of Bob Dylans, Haynes assembles a portrait not of the man but of our incompatible perceptions. Coming away from 'I'm Not There,' one has replenished one's palette for a few of Dylan's songs, we've seen six exceptionally able actors put to the test for the first time in a long time by taking on the roles of components of a total person. And I was very fond of the Fellini references in Cate Blanchett's thread.",8,0,0,8 September 2008
The Big Lebowski," A Bizarrely Winning Fargo Follow-Up Seen Best Through a Haze of Bong Smoke, Whether Yours or the Characters'
","The Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski is a friendly, clumsy comedy about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is illustrated by the narrator as 'the laziest man in Los Angeles County.' He lives merely to go bowling, but is taken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with calamitous results. We all know people like the Dude, and so, supposedly, do the Coen brothers. They rooted the character in a producer named Jeff Dowd. Both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderliness.The Dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong Lebowski, but before they discover that, one has already peed on the Dude's rug, sparking intense hostility: 'That rug really tied the room together,' the Dude laments. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak leads the vendetta. Sponging lines straight from Bush 41, he declares that 'this aggression will not stand' and insists the Dude 'draw a line in the sand.' The Dude drops in on the real Lebowski, leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaire's conspiracies.Rich Lebowski, wheelchair-bound like General Sternwood and staring into a fireplace like Major Amberson, wants the Dude to deliver his wife Bunny's ransom. This plot is countered by Maude, Lebowski's eccentric daughter from a past marriage. Julianne Moore, who played a porno actress in the great Boogie Nights, here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist, swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness. L.A. in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus. The Dude is prone to lively fantasies when he's punched out or knocked unconscious, which occurs frequently, and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful POV shot from within a bowling ball.The Big Lebowski tears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere. That isn't so much a failing as its technique. The Dude, who rocks a lot of ganj,' swigs White Russians mixed with half-and-half, begins each day full of determination, but his devices steadily melt into a fog of lost chances and misconstrued intent. The atmosphere is set up right at first, when the narrator begins sufficiently well but ultimately admits he's lost his own gist, a droll curveball drawing our attention to the incidence of screenwriters who will never be unwilling to remove all support from us even after it has been literally soiled by a shaggy-dog-story character we may or may not ever see again in this chaotic plot.This could never equal its predecessor Fargo, but it's bizarrely winning, like its hero, played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, potbelly, ponytail and Bermuda shorts so bulky they may have been scrounged from his sounding board and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak. Their other teammate is Donny, who may not be too sharp-witted, but it's difficult to know as he's never permitted to finish a sentence. Set at the time of the Gulf War, here are characters whose language was created by earlier times, Vietnam, flower power and the Twilight Zone. As with Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski shows us a protagonist whose doofus-y simplicity appears to be his sole defense from the real world. He and Walter's very idea of real life may be wrought by the narrow ways they have to express it. Bridges does more with his downcast physical expression than countless comics can manage by laying it on thick.From its opening credits, The Big Lebowski indeed appears and feels like a shuck-and-jive. That's why the recognizable premise of a staged kidnapping complete with betrayals is only outwardly commonplace. Crime and reason are not the concerns here. What matters is how hard-wearing the two or three characters we're most concerned for are, despite the misfortune generated by their own ineptness. The Big Lebowski---a surrealist farce cooked up by the unruly Coens out of odds and ends of the deep-rooted and the new-fangled, the philosophical and the primal, in a fraction of LA where heightened reality crashes with autistic character interaction---amounts to noticeably less than the sum of its frequently lively and entertaining parts.",8,1,2,11 July 2011
Star Trek," The Forceful Relationship Between Entertainment Cinema and Its Audiences.
","J.J. Abrams is, as has been made quite evident by now, a time traveler at heart, a heart which loves everything old: old faces, old times, old manners, old franchises. In an age when cinema has become entirely its own storytelling beast, its own approach to manifesting drama, the more accustomed acting for the camera being less and less drawn from the theatre, one greatly admires the work of actors like Chris Pine, the malleable concrete which forms the basis of Captain Kirk's reconstruction, and Zachary Quinto, who has a look of infinite dexterity in his obvious physical proclivity for Spock, who don't have to bounce around and reel off monologues ridden with words accentuated on paper with all caps, instead utilizing the great amount of character in their faces. They are never uninteresting. But before I allow you to conclude that my point is that this new Star Trek reboot is a unique, unadulterated piece of talent free from its interrelations of media bondage, it should be made clear that it is a big 'Hey, how ya doin'?' for Trekkies, much of the impact of the story being implicit to followers of the half-century franchise. To boot, the film's highly creative director J.J. Abrams, perhaps due to the lion's share of his career having been spent in epic TV projects, directs this starter-up as if it were the pilot to an all-new Star Trek TV series. I have never been more conscious of the fact that the story arch will not conclude here but in multiple sequels to come.The pre-title sequence is incredible. The intensity of the action and the emotional impact of the scene's progression are not taken for granted, as Abrams makes great use of the music score and manipulation of sound to augment it all to full effect. Flash-forward to the rebellious youth of angry, reckless, fatherless James Tiberius Kirk. This segment is just about the only one in the whole film that loosens up within the iron grip of a domineering fan base. Once again, the music choice is interesting, the scene is loaded with action and implications of the futuristic setting, any and everyone is enjoying themselves.Writers Orci and Kurtzman seem to fully understand that genre films often include clearcut plot assurances like moral certainties and action set pieces so that solving the film's conflicts can be submitted to the genre. Even parodies or criticisms of a genre rely on the audience's acquaintance with it. Thus, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek succeeds within its genre. I suppose what makes me less than partial to this film is the general ideological notions of the world of Star Trek.Where Star Wars presents a story of intelligence in the universe existing a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, full of interplanetary travel on an everyday, almost casual basis, suggesting the fascinating notion of life on Earth possibly in the prehistoric era, Star Trek suggests that humanity on Earth, primarily Americans with the exception of a few token foreigners with characteristic specialties, is the ennobled savior of the universe against countless other forms of intelligence which learn more from us than we learn from them. I believe that if Romulans can emerge from the future to create black holes out of planets and Vulcans can live for hundreds of years and share thoughts, experiences, memories and knowledge through physical contact, not to mention live by the phrase 'Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations,' which we still have yet to discover, it is not likely that they are the less evolved or efficient beings in comparison to humans.Both films and their audiences are culturally operated. What a film means can and does change, but basic idealized views are taken for granted by the story. These conclusions are rooted in reiteration, which leads us to assume things unless they are outwardly countered. But that alone is not the mark of the text. It may assume particular messages and inferences, but it exists to take risks, to work through theoretical dilemmas, the purpose of the movie hero breaking new ground in relation to such things. In part due to this movie in particular being a franchise rejuvenation, they are not reproduced so much as refreshed, not so much repeated as reworked.The fascination of film is reinforced by initial fascination already at work within the subject and the social establishments that molded it. Indeed, the filmmakers would've found their balls in a salad shooter if they disappointed enough fans. I believe that there is a lot about this movie's creative process that I have yet to know, hence I am sure that this film is more of a success than I realize.",7,1,7,28 July 2009
As Good as It Gets," Contemporary Classic
","Jack Nicholson, from what I've seen so far, has never given a bad performance in his life. This is no exception to that claim. Even more, As Good As It Gets is a slight departure from his trademark screen persona, a snakily charming, confident, and dry man with a penchant for almost comically devilish eyebrow movements and sharky grins. Instead, here he is an older man with insecurities so overwhelming that he desperately hides it all underneath a wry and crude meanness that he jabs at nearly everyone he meets, harming them first before they can do what he fears out of a corrosive neuroses, which is that they'll harm his fragile ego first. He only begins to realize how much he yearns to be liked after so many unfortunate things happen to his neighbor, inadvertently causing so many fortunate things to happen to him, giving him a taste of how good life gets before things once again even out, making him want to become a better man.Helen Hunt's tremendously human performance stands out almost as far as Nicholson's, a feat that has since the 1970s been quite difficult to accomplish. To equal Nicholson's naturally upstaging presence is quite impressive. She seems almost as if she was born to play the waitress whose ill son is constantly on her mind but always keeps that winning smile on her face. She is very funny and deeply felt, imperfect and in such a realistic way.The film's breakthrough comes from Greg Kinnear, whose charm affects the sensitive role he plays, a homosexual painter, constantly under the heterosexual gun, often held by the nasty shell of the Nicholson character, and unfairly given the inarguably shortest end of the straw, yet always patient and accepting enough, until he reaches a point. Kinnear has an airy promptness and propensity for physical drama that make him a perfect counterpart for the other two stars.Something I find infinitely appealing about As Good As It Gets is its focus on the dog as a character. The dog is billed (as three different dogs) in the credits, and is developed as a character, as an interesting friendship grows between him and the Nicholson character, and grows into an adapter for the relationship between Nicholson and Kinnear.As Good As It Gets is one of the most well-written films I've seen recently. In it is hilarious humor, heartfelt character drama, and a chain of seemingly unrelated events with three different people rippling towards each other. Its extensive running time is due to its passionate development and concentration on these three very different people and their colliding lives.",10,1,1,24 December 2006
Citizen Kane," A Hugely Boastful Celebration of Style
","Citizen Kane is a film that has a lot of unprecedented stylistic freedom in terms of the time in which it was made, and that would of course cause an impact upon release. Orson Welles worked in radio and theatre. He was not practiced in film. This was his first. But all the imagination and passion he had in creating images on radio and in his mind were depicted as ambitiously as they could be in Citizen Kane. It begins with a news reel, then with a scene with several men wherein we never see their faces, but their silhouettes. We see points of view from inside a snow dome and cranking in on us through solid objects like windows and screens and people. Kane has something a lot of movies, even great ones, don't have, and that's raw vision. Raw vision is great, because it's entirely personal.The problem is that Welles made such an overwhelming effort to announce his presence both in front of the camera and behind it that the film's story is of secondary importance, subordinated by his main concern which is how differently it is told. I speak objectively, I believe, as I did not live during a generation that was so directly impacted by the film's revisioning of cinema. I am accustomed to films by directors who did and in turn managed to heavily influence mine. I find its widely hailed position as the #1 greatest movie of all time to be the most grandiose excess of praise of which I can readily think. There are many scores of movies from the 1940s that hold up much better over time. That is not to say that Kane is corny or archaic by today's standards but that the vulnerability of unused audiences to being blindsided by its style and ambition is much less perceptible. I must not be in such a small group who sees the tremendous self-importance and braggadocio exclusively exuded by Welles.Are you not the biggest ham in the world if you make a film debut as a writer/director who casts himself in the role of extremely rich tycoon Charles Foster Kane who dies in his gaping mammoth mansion Xanadu, before which uttering his last word which reporters and producers obsess over trying to understand?Welles is extraordinarily smug and narcissistic, but he does very much know himself, because Kane is really not so much written with William Randolph Hearst in mind as he is with Welles himself in mind, and his life came to eerily resemble Kane's.",10,1,2,25 July 2007
Monster," Audacity, Craft and Humanity
","It's not that there's not the occasional film about unattractive women, or average-looking without magic cheekbones, with enough body fat to feasibly menstruate. It's that they'll hire statuesque, ideal blondes who'll gain artistic weight, sit for three hours of makeup to facilitate the appearance of a simple human being like the rest of us. Should a film about a real person be in competition for a Best Makeup Oscar? Nevertheless, all the same, what Theron pulls off isn't a performance but an incarnation. With audacity, craft and humanity, she purely draws us into Aileen Wuornos' final frantic attempt to be a better person than her luck proposed. Her performance is so concentrated and forceful that it becomes a reality for us. There's no trace of negligence in her eyes as she directly imparts what she's feeling and thinking. There's the eerie impression that she's forgotten the camera and script, candidly focusing her notions of Wuornos.Watching this, I've no awareness of makeup procedure. I simply watch one of the realest people on the screen. The movie opens with Aileen telling God she's down to her last $5, that if God doesn't lead her to spend it right she'll end it all. She walks into what happens to be a lesbian bar and meets the 18-year-old Selby, who's been sent to live with Florida relatives and be 'cured.' Aileen's steadfast that she's had no lesbian encounters, and to be sure her rundown life as a bottom-rung hooker's left her with no predilection for sex at all. Selby's own sexuality works effectively as a way to offend her fundamentalist parents and indulge her longing to be wanted. There's a striking scene when the two bond with unrefined sexual vigor, but in time sex is irrelevant judged against distraction, watching TV, and acting out their personal soap in second-rate curb motels.Monster's partially derived from the real Wuornos' prison letters to an associate recounting her life and her despairing relationship with Selby Wall, but you can't help but wonder how can we bank on what she says about herself? How can we be sure about those letters' truth or sentiments? Certainly, there'd be truthfulness to be found in them, detecting hidden meaning, analyzing, deciphering, but Monster plays so directly that there are no angles to contemplate, no veils we might be on the brink of peeling away. However, that's the irony of telling the story not as an omniscient investigative report but as a subjective dramatization: Aileen was an wild, unrestrained personality behind a face aged before its time, devastated by sun, booze and all varieties of cruelty. Psychotic, maybe. Beset with rage, unquestionably. Not a sound woman at all, whether or not she'd never killed.Aileen's proudly the guardian and bread-winner, also bringing back cars that Selby doesn't ask too many questions about. Does she know that Aileen has begun snuffing her customers? She does and doesn't. Aileen's murder binge becomes considerable long before Selby focuses on it. The crimes themselves are set off by Aileen's hatred for prostitution, a lifetime's disgust for how men have treated her since she was a child. She's but one male friend, a devastated Vietnam vet and fellow drunk. Although she first kills in self-defense, she's also lashing out against her past. Her encounter of love with Selby brings revolt disentangling from her memories. The most disturbing scene is the death of a good man who truly wants to help her, but has appeared so late in her life that the only way he can help is to be gotten rid of. Aileen tells her story, and her voice, both narrating and on-screen, seems from some angle to be the vehicle for the story, if not its whole reason for being. But each character within it speaks with their own voice.Aileen's body language is startling and captivating. She doesn't know how to inhabit her body. Theron spends a range of small arm straightening, physical adjustments, head tosses, hair touchings, as she apprehensively attempts to shake out her anxiety and look composed. She handles her cigarettes with the insecure bluster of a 13-year-old trying to make an impact on a kid. There's but one moment in Monster when she appears comfortable, content with herself. The scene will account for itself.Christina Ricci finds perfect pitch for Selby, so persuasive some take it for bad acting, when actually she's very moving in her rendering of a poor actor. She plays Selby as naive, weak, in over her head, picking up signals moment-to-moment, paving her actions out of ideas sponged from bad movies, old songs, barroom romances. Selby must've walked into a gay bar for the first time just a few weeks ago, and looked anxiously to fathom how to present herself. Selby and Aileen frequently try to extemporize the next line they imagine the other wants to hear.Despite questions outside the material itself, Monster declines to objectify Wuornos and her acts of violence, to take advantage of her legend in the disparaging approach of true-crime sensationalism, persevering in seeing her as a fully dimensional person entitled to our consideration. She's been so viciously misshapen by life that she seems incapable of decency, yet when she loves for the first time, she's moved to strive to be a better person.She's tragically unfit for this mêlée, and doesn't have the assistance of cleverness and reason. She's empty of normal honorable principles. She's brash, uncontrolled, outraged. There's no justification for what she does, but there are causes. The aim of the movie's to bring them to the fore. If life had given her anything whatsoever to use, it'd be a much different story.",10,0,1,21 October 2010
Amistad," A Beautifully Made Film, a Somewhat Superficial Victory
","Slavery in and of itself could, I imagine, be viewed essentially as an issue of legalese and territorial ownership, at least to those taking advantage of it. One of the confounding truths offered in Steven Spielberg's Amistad is that seven of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices in 1839 were slave-owning Southerners. His skillfully made Dreamworks opener zeroes in on the statutory condition of Africans who rebel against their abductors on the high seas and are brought to trial in a New England court. Slavery itself is not the core of contention. Rather, the court must choose whether the defendants were born of slaves, in which case they are guilty of murder, or were illegally brought from Africa and therefore had a right to rise up against kidnapping. But the law's clarification is not distinguished as much as it could have been for a movie with that as its core issue. The international slave trade had been abolished by treaties by this time, although those who were already slaves continued to be owned by their masters, as did their children. The ethical cutting of corners of that clarification is extremely cold-blooded, but on it relies the defense of Cinque, the leader of the Africans, and his comrades defiant.Amistad, like Spielberg's Schindler's List, is not just indignant opposition to moral deprivation. We do not need movies to persuade us of the evil of slavery and the Holocaust. Both films are about the ways good men attempt to collaborate pragmatically within a morally deprived government to clear merely some of its prey. Schindler's techniques are brilliant, create tension, and result in a more arresting and impactful film than the bureaucratic stratagems in Amistad, where lawyers in powdered wigs attempt to decide the homeland of men whose language they do not speak. Having nothing to do with the ethical quandaries concerned, Schindler's List works better as a story as it is about a tightrope con game, while Amistad is about the hunt for a determination that, if found, will be of minor importance to the millions of other slaves. On the whole, the movie doesn't have the sensory explosiveness of Spielberg's seminal historical films, Schindler, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, which all moved me to tears.The instances of the most feeling in Amistad transcend the central story. I speak of a mortifying scene where, with food running low on the ship, the less durable slaves are chained together and thrown over the side to drown so that more food will be left for the rest. And another sequence in which the bilious innards of the slave trade are gazed upon, as Africans kidnap people of rival groups and sell them to slave traders. A scene where Cinque sees African violets in John Quincy Adams' greenhouse and is crippled by nostalgia. And Cinque's recollection of his wife left in Africa.What is most vital about Amistad is how it gives faces and names to its African characters. The slave named Cinque emboldens as a memorable human being, a once-free farmer who has lost his wife and family. We see his wife, and his village, and something of his life; we grasp how heartlessly he was torn from his life and dreams. He speaks no English, though takes in a little while in prison, and a translator is found who helps him communicate his human disgust at a legal system that may free him but will not acknowledge the all-too-obvious essence of the crime against him. He learns enough of Western civilization to discern its dissonances, as in a scene where another slave expresses with an illustrated Bible how he can relate to Jesus. And there is that inevitable moment between lawyer and client in which McConaughey's character finally talks to Cinque as a man and not as a rook on a chessboard. 'Give us free!' Cinque cries in an immense scene in the courtroom, causing all to confront how little a 'not guilty' verdict would matter to the absolute reality of his case.Djimon Hounsou's performance relies considerably on his screen presence, which is a powerhouse. Some of the other performances are somewhat let-downs. I was taken aback by how little substance or screen time was given to the Morgan Freeman character, a former slave turned abolitionist who in his few scenes tells of the mines of humanity that stay buried. Maybe that's the point: It's not about being black at the time; it's about the laws of the time. Matthew McConaughey is obligated by the film to have his head in the clouds as the defense attorney; he plods along from cold-hearted legal objectivity to a touching realization of sympathy that we were all expecting, and while we are satisfied for him we are not by any means much moved. Nigel Hawthrone plays Martin Van Buren, who is portrayed as a waffling case of backbone deficiency who just wants to keep the South off his back. Another fun highlight is how he is accosted with demands by the Queen of Spain, played by a pubescent Anna Paquin, who is upset that she can't have the new toys she was excited to get.The axis of this film, basically, is in Anthony Hopkins' haunting performance as old John Quincy Adams, who speaks for 11 minutes in defense of the defendants, and holds the courtroom, and us, movingly absorbed. It is one of the great movie courtroom speeches. However in applauding it, I broach the film's main concern: It is too much about the law and not enough about the victims. That John Quincy Adams triumphs in his noble cause is a wonderful accomplishment for him and a huge weight off Cinque's shoulders and his follower slaves, yet in the tragic entrails of American slavery, it is a somewhat superficial victory.",8,0,2,24 May 2010
Iron Man 2," Tony Stark, A Self-Made Man Who Worships His Creator
","Believe it or not, Iron Man 2, not during but after I saw it, made me ponder. It made me wonder about the endlessly precarious concept of privatizing the military. Look at the dangers we've witnessed, ones that have come true that we've taken lying down, of privatizing our health care system, our news sources, energy, mortgage associations. Tony Stark, apparently the coolest, hottest, richest and most famous guy on earth, after acquiring most of what he has as a war profiteer---as fans know and as the first movie tells us---he now has an unbelievable weapon that he wears and uses for long-distance transportation and frankly for fun. The government wants it, but it's his suit and he insists on doing whatever he wants with it. I'm not so sure I blame the government.Couldn't something that wreaks the kind of havoc that the Iron Man suit does be put to more productive and controlled use under the supervision of the people and their representatives? I look at Tony Stark and see---can't evade---a man in less discernible control of his ego than five Kanye Wests. Also, a man that rich is going to do anything, because he's confident he can---and he will---get away with anything. Yes, Stark is made out to be one swell guy, saving us from the danger of another guy in a weapon suit, even though that guy only really seems interested in hurting Mr. Yay Free Enterprise Stark, but he's Russian so we don't like him, so there's your reason for his being the bad guy. I feel we should spend less time rooting for Iron Man and being warier of his lack of discipline, natural monopoly and concentration of assets as he provokes more danger than he's worth. But hey, I'm not suggesting Stark apply for statehood; his ego already has anyway.I honestly really do go into colossal Hollywood blockbusters wanting to like them. I want to enjoy myself and admire the movie I'm enjoying. The most admirable quality of Iron Man 2 is the most admirable quality of Iron Man 1, which is that in spite of whether or not characters are hackneyed or effects are overblown and tedious, the rapport between the performers is always engaging, natural and razor-sharp. Naturally, the movie was pre-sold by Downey's charm. The movie has an enormously effective non-sequitary sense of humor that delivers huge laughs by undercutting any zeal. These big CGI set pieces, after all, take a whole lot of logic for granted. This example seems unanimous among viewers: Tony Stark, seemingly on impulse and out of nowhere, chooses to drive his own car in the Monaco Grand Prix, and Ivan Vanko mounts dauntlessly in the middle of the strip, dressed like a deviant jouster and sporting electric whips that can slice a car in two. He nearly destroys Stark, which is so thrilling that we almost overlook questions such as how Vanko knew that Tony suddenly decided to drive his own car in a race he wasn't even attending personally to begin with, or why in the hell the crowd does not flee but stays to collectively react throughout this cataclysmic fight like they're at a football game.The absolute highlight of the film is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, the classic Pushover Up To No Good. In a movie not only brimming with star ego but star ego that could cut diamond at a thirty-foot distance, Rockwell is pure refreshment. He is always a completely natural actor, as much himself as a character will allow him to be. In all, it seems as if the script is trying to make him all weasel, all antagonist, and Rockwell defies any two-dimensionality by making him, yes, a weasel, yes, an antagonist, but also a whole person. His way is by being laid-back and without affectation.Nonetheless, the dialogue scenes are so effective and enjoyable that when an action sequence comes around, it only inspires me to think about how the guys can stand it within those suits. Yes, the suits are shatterproof, but their bodies aren't. How many staggering plummets, ferocious poundings and sly detonators can you withstand without shattering all of your bones? Wouldn't the weight of being encased in iron make the blows hit harder? Stars can be acceptable as to need the skeletal least character in the story. They're watched for their own sake, not for their representation of a scripted character. It's about the cast itself, not what it's doing here. We love Don Cheadle, but largely what he's given to actually do here is oddly find time to chat with Downey while soaring through a typhoon of assailing missiles. (How slow must a missile be if your crony has time to advise you to steer clear of it?) I don't know what it says about Scarlet Johansson's quality as an actress that she's upstaged by her own backside. But she's given good performances in great films, and I think the issue has more to do with Jon Favreau's preferred camera angles and my being a guy.The vainglorious behavior comes naturally, but now it's advantageous as a put-on, a case of mistaken nonentity. The sequel to Iron Man does not offer a changed man. Within the hardware, impaired humanity becomes even more so, as inviting challenges of selfhood cross with a high-tech wet dream made everyman. I guess there are lot of young men who need icons like Iron Man. Narcissism and self-deception are survival mechanisms without which many of them might just jump off a bridge.",7,0,2,5 August 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Fulfilling, Honest Romance Dryly Flaunts Huge Laughs
","Jason Segel, the writer and star of this surprisingly great entertainment, is plagued by melancholia. The film evinces that he likes to feel like a star, at least in the ragtag circle he's amassed of Judd Apatow's expansively talented posse. His character here is a TV musical sting composer who has spent five years adoring his girlfriend, television star Sarah Marshall despite living completely in her shadow like some deposed tsar still doing his seemingly post-middle-age royalty routine for flatterers/bartenders. His journey seems essentially to aim as high as he may in love, not settling for second-best rundowns, and yet to still secure the same kind of neutral lifestyle with a righteous babe with brains, bod and spirit, the challenge of the journey being to realize that that has been his circumstance for five years.Director Nicholas Stoller seems to surrender to a higher power, so to speak, by being entirely malleable to Segel's material, providing merely a backdrop for the cast to let loose with the goofy, impeccably timed extemporaneous hilarity to which they've become accustomed under Apatow's philanthropic wing. This is indeed the charm of Stoller's elusive touch from the illusory helm, showing an unusual degree of flexibility for a film director.In subduing any style, the story flows very deeply, mainstream romantic comedy or not, and allows Segel's underdog lead quite an expose of a journey to 'forgetting Sarah Marshall,' a catharsis of the id which conquers his depressed self-image. Along the way are quirky escapes such as Russell Brand's about-face in my perspective as surprisingly interesting in the role of the title character's new narcissistic rock star boyfriend, Paul Rudd's burnt-out surfer, Bill Hader's ungraceful friend from back home, Davon McDonald's silver-tongued bartender and Jack McBrayder's hilarious rendition of a repressed young religious virgin who's just gotten married. The highlight of the film is Jonah Hill's Hawaiian waiter, who comes to be an awkward, overzealously pushy fan of Brand's. As with Superbad and Knocked Up, he sprinkles fleeting nuances of over-the-top inflections that inspire huge laughs.As is Apatow's agenda, it's a romantic comedy aimed at guys. All the men in the film get in touch with their feelings, inadequacies and gross idiosyncrasies, rather than safely remaining with the limitations of merely a hot guy who's cool and cocky. And indeed, these films have a much better probability of being satisfactory entertainments, because in spite of their condescended genre they give honest impressions of what it's like to be a horny young guy who seeks the approval of his friends and the women to whom he's attracted. From a film like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we are fulfilled by the best one can hope for in a film of its kind, and it does that by releasing the leash of social pressures. Jason Segel is funny because he depicts himself as so insecure, but there is nerve in doing that because he imparts to us that there is wisdom in insecurity.",8,0,2,18 May 2009
Stripes," A Hundred-Dollar Shine on a Three-Dollar Pair of Shoes
","I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails.You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training.The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them.Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.",7,4,5,7 September 2011
Hostel," Humans are Capable of the Truly Unspeakable
","Hostel is the second film by Eli Roth, writer and director of Cabin Fever, which I did not like, personally. I found that Hostel, however, was an improvement, although I think Roth is still warming up. Hostel shows that Roth can make a movie with smart intentions towards its structure, but unfortunately it falls short of what it could so easily be, a nearly unbearably intense horror film. Instead of being scary like the slowly paced, mysteriously gleeful exposition seems to prepare us for, it becomes a gorefest and a chase film. That is all enjoyable, but Roth has yet to truly scare me.What I especially love about Hostel is that Roth demonstrates his complete lack of fear or hesitation in giving an audience complete satisfaction of their anger and frustration, and yet at the same time, he is very patient with his story. Roth lets his characters be human and whole in the most interesting avenues to employ realistic approaches to them, one of them being to masquerade them as token fratboy slasher film stick figures, and at the same time, they are impatiently, furiously, monstrously vindictive.The film's scenes of gore are range in effect, and they are all good. There are very brief yet extremely disturbing images, and there are extensive scenes that are actually quite fun because of the suspense weaved by the clever situation that faces graphic violence at point blank range.Hostel simply doesn't have the impact it needs to be what it's supposed to be. It doesn't pack a punch. It packs more of a John Cleese eye poke.",8,1,1,18 June 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Kids' Movie Where You're Not Supposed to Think and You're Not Supposed to Do Anything but Escape for Two Hours and Return to Your Life Afterward
","The fantasy genre provides us with a way of viewing the universal conditions of the world, the environment, governments, and other large-scope subjects with an objective eye. Somehow, all we seem to get out of it nonetheless is the spectacle of these stories, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Northern Lights series, the Narnia series. There is a lot more that could be done with The Chronicles of Narnia. I am not sure of whether or not I'm talking about the original work by C.S. Lewis as well as this film version or just the latter, because I have never read the books. From what I've seen here, and thus from what the new generation of children are seeing, is innocent abandon. There is no real import in the concept of a wardrobe that arbitrarily leads into an alternate world without humans full of mythological creatures and talking wolves and beavers.I feel as if the concept should've been put in the hands of Neil Gaiman, who once wrote a novel told from the point of view of a bus. I am thrilled by the idea of a humanless world, but not by populating it with humans. I enjoyed the non-human characters, and I enjoyed the audacity of the filmmakers who allowed Tilda Swinton's witch to be a truly vicious villain, an icy, power-hungry and completely ruthless baddie. I was affected by a scene between her and Aslan, a wise and idealistically good lion, and I can imagine how much children would be bothered by it. But for what? Is this the three English siblings' fortunate escape from the harrowing WWII from which they've been sent away by their mother?Everything about the story seems entirely unsystematic and with no real underpinnings, except that Aslan seemingly represents Christ for devout Christian C.S. Lewis. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch as if to represent Satan. Why does time go on in Narnia and when the siblings return to the reality of the British manor home they have only spent a few seconds of reality? Why is the alternate reality called Narnia? It is all a haphazard succession of building blocks leading to what to which all of the fantasy adventures lead: the big battle between these creatures and those creatures. Pure good and pure evil. Black and white. Love and hate. More diverting scapegoating and jingoism for the kids who recently lost their father and are only left to bicker with themselves till they stumble upon a parallel world, which to them is an emotional distraction more than anything else. They could make their goals to retreat back into the wardrobe, but they would rather consume themselves with drama that is far removed from their own. Is there anything wrong with that? No, it's natural. But why would fantasy settle on such common human weaknesses when it supposedly transcends every other everyday convention?It's a kids' movie where you're not supposed to think and you're not supposed to do anything but escape for two hours and return to your life afterward. That is not the way we are supposed to look at things. We cannot turn our minds off, no matter how hard we try. Children absorb everything. They absorb histrionics and dramatics. One appeal of the story could be that its magic and myth are determined not by the arbitrary world-building technicalities that many fantasy writers pull from their sleeves, though that certainly still occurs here as much as in Tolkien or Rowling's stories, but by the markedly English tenacity of the human kids. I do love that this film, like countless other kids' movies, humanizes and familiarizes animals of all kinds. But the story offers not much in the way of acceptance or moral dichotomies.",7,0,0,19 January 2009
Public Enemies," I Would Not Care About the Inaccuracies as Much if the Film Didn't Disguise Itself as a Painstakingly Genuine Docudrama.
","Public Enemies masquerades in digital camera-work, painstakingly nuanced settings and period details that go so far as to be actual objects held by the characters in real life, the movie disguising as a hyper-realistic docudrama when it is really a complete and utter butchery of history. I would not care about the historical inaccuracies as much if the film were given a more romantic treatment by its cameras, sets and props. It is a novel technique for Michael Mann to bring his recent adoption of digital film-making to the Hollywood biopic, but it gives us every signal that we are watching dramatized history when we are watching nothing but fiction. So there have been many biopics which have taken poetic license, but why do so when the true story is head over heels more intriguing and surprising? When compared to opening the film by featuring Dillinger in prison breaks he did not and could not have been involved in, thus propelling the narrative in a fictitious direction immediately, I don't mind the script having Dillinger and Melvin Purvis meet each other; it is undeniably Mann's echo of the key scene between cop and criminal in his masterpiece Heat, in a strikingly different context. (Rather than blending into the hustle-bustle of L.A., Purvis and Dillinger talk on either side of jail bars in the middle of the sticks, in a time where men on opposite sides of the law knew the starkly defined doctrine of right and wrong too well to permit themselves empathy for each other as the two leads of Heat do in a modern age where the line is much thinner.) But consider the gunfight at the wooded lodge: In reality, over seventy exiting patrons were accosted by mistaken FBI gunfire and Dillinger's gang got away clean. Purvis was not a cool, patient hero but an under-qualified officer tormented by his constant mishaps under pressure. Mann uses it as an excuse for an admittedly spectacular Tommy gun fight between cops and robbers. As a result of his urge to force in great gunplay, every single Dillinger associate who survived him in reality is killed in the movie, all instances being completely different than the way they actually died. Baby Face's real death was a sheer phenomenon that this impatient and simple-minded film revises completely.Mostly, it is Mann's focus on Dillinger's relationship with Billie Frichette that mutes its impact. Dillinger never had less than two girls at a time, whereas this film not only jacks the tear jerking romantic love-at-first-sight convention up to 100 degrees but also portrays Dillinger's legendary death purely in terms of how sad it is that the lovebirds won't be seeing each other anymore. This, too, affects true account in unnecessary and even implausible ways.This is not a terrible film. Mann finds great success in bringing Dillinger's middle-class folk hero status to veritable life. Johnny Depp is not playing the clever hood based on other movie gangster performances he has seen. He fits into a kindred link with the man's earthy, down-home clarity. He plays Dillinger as a fact, and we thoroughly believe every behavioral note he hits. It is a perfect performance. That goes for every performance, in their own ways, whether they're hemmed by the script or they require something off-putting like Billy Crudup's transatlantic accent playing J. Edgar Hoover.Maybe the reason Mann and his co-writers permit him to outlive his associates is because in the minds of the succeeding generations in flyover country, he has. Born and raised in Ohio, I know older people who have but a very few degrees of separation from Dillinger. As opposed to the American coasts, where the country truly is a melting pot and not nearly as much comes as a surprise or a break from the norm, the American Midwest is an incurably normal region of general traditions and populist values, where a dangerous criminal who was involved in the deaths of several police officers, robbed at least two dozen banks and four police stations, escaped from jail twice and was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood considerably stands out against the backdrop. Thus the deeds of Dillinger and his gang controlled the attention of the American press and its readers during the Depression era, a period which led to the result of the current, more advanced FBI.As an entertainment, there are so many highlights here, especially Stephen Graham's maniacal portrayal of Baby Face Nelson. Tommy may not have been named after a gun, but here we learn he unequivocally should've been. There's Marion Cotillard's prudent, humble performance as Dillinger's main squeeze, the various creatively captured Tommy gun fights and the idealistic use of Otis Taylor's great song 10,000 Slaves. But whatever rationalizations can be made for the romanticization of the Dillinger story, there simply is no reason why we should be deprived of the remarkable, fascinating and truly presently poignant true account of it, which is incomparably more engrossing.",7,0,1,16 September 2009
Bloody Sunday," A Compelling Return to the Startling Immediacy of the Cinema Verite of the 1960s and '70s
","Both sides concur that the eponymous civil rights demonstration in Derry, Northern Ireland, ended with a skirmish between some of the demonstrators and British army paratroopers. Ultimately, 13 demonstrators were dead and 14 in the hospital, one of whom later died. None of the casualties were British troops. A formal inquest proclaimed that the soldiers had defended its position against armed demonstrators. Some of the soldiers involved were later honored by the crown.Outside this understanding, there's a dispute so profound and indignant that three decades later Bloody Sunday is still an open gash in the lingering, disputed account of the British in Northern Ireland. Paul Greengrass' Golden Bear-winning film is shot on 16mm, made in the manner of a documentary. It encompasses roughly 24 hours, beginning on Saturday evening, and its central character is Ivan Cooper, a civil rights organizer in Derry. He was a Protestant MP from the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party. Most of the 10,000 demonstrators on that Sunday would be Catholic. That a Protestant led them reveals the separation in the north between those who stood in unity with their co-religionists, and those of all beliefs who just wanted the British out.Cooper is played by James Nesbitt as a completely excellent guy, hopeful, diligent, who walks boldly through hazardous streets and has a good remark for everyone. He knows the day's demonstration has been prohibited by the British government but anticipates no conflict, as it will be diplomatic and peaceful. As Cooper distributes flyers in the streets, Greengrass intercuts measures by the British army, which is fully resolute to take a muscular position against 'hooliganism.' Several British soldiers have been killed by the IRA, and this is an opportunity to settle scores. The British continue giving themselves tell-tale indications of how to prevent violence when they say things like, 'If they see the Paras, that'll inflame the situation.' So basically, the people demonstrating for their rights will only become violent if the troops try to stop them from demonstrating for their rights. Which they do. So the British knew the truth before the atrocity even occurred.Greengrass also establishes some other characters, including a young man who kisses his girlfriend goodbye and assures his mother no hurt will come to him, classic threatening omens in a movie. And we meet the Derry police chief, troubled by the ferocious doggedness of the soldiers and asks, not irrationally, if it wouldn't be more prudent to just allow the march because it's clearly going to carry on anyhow. Greengrass reconstructs proceedings with striking realism. When he shows a movie marquee promoting the Schlesinger film Sunday Bloody Sunday, it's a tiny anomaly, a deliberate shot in a movie that aims for cinema verite. He's served by the incidence of thousands of volunteer extras, some having demonstrated on Bloody Sunday and are relatively playing themselves.Cooper and the other influentials are on a truck which pilots the procession, and from their POV we can see that when the march avoids the army's spot, some hotheads instead start to throw rocks at them. At Major General's headquarters, commands are given to counter decisively. Data lines are obscured, orders are hazy as they dispatch down the pecking order, and soon rubber bullets and gas grenades are substituted by the shatter of actual bullets. Once this begins, we get the truest visceral sense of how difficult it must be to resist physical retaliation, and thus the true profundity of pacifism.Greengrass sees marchers struggling to control some of their comrades who are armed, but his film is unmistakable in its conviction that the British fired first and without mercy, and he shows one injured demonstrator being eliminated execution-style. One of the marchers is based on Gerald Donaghey, who, after being wounded, was searched twice, first by doctors, then taken to an army section where he died. Soldiers then 'discovered' nail bombs on his person that had been 'overlooked' in the earlier searches. This is part of a frantic effort by the army to plant evidence and validate a slaughter. OK, there are two sides to the story, but 14 dead marchers alongside a complete lack of dead or wounded soldiers seems telling. The Greengrass standpoint reproduces the rage of the anti-British groups, and the army's self-satisfaction after being acquitted in the initial investigation was simply infuriating. This raw, ultimately brutalizing tragedy is an extremely valuable vision of what occurred that day. And as an act of filmmaking, it's stunning: A sense of urgent and present-tense reality pervades every powerhouse moment.",10,3,6,6 May 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," Can One Forsake a Passion?
","This psychophysiological thriller begins with the meeting, after many years, of Benjamin and Irene. She's a judge. He's a retired criminal investigator. They're a little too happy to see each other. Twenty-five years ago, when she was assistant to a judge and he was an investigator under her, they were caught up in a vicious case of rape and murder. Benjamin visited the crime scene, and the dead woman's body powerfully told of the crime's cruelty. Two workers were arrested and convicted. Benjamin was never positive of their guilt. Now he tells Irene that on his own time he wants to write about the case.There's a revelation that comes that I felt caused the film to be overcooked, but regardless, slowly the emotional grandeur and tragedy of that aim become plainer after this begins an interesting backward-and-forward excursion through time, between Buenos Aires in the 1970s and the turn of the new millennium, which reintroduces both the crime and the unrequited sentiment that's lingered all these years between Irene and Benjamin. That's where their individual allure emerges. Actress Soledad Villamil is mature, strong, rational and probably cast for her eyes, as the film has masses of close-ups, and they're essential to hiding secrets. Playing Irene at ages 25 years apart, she's never too young or too old, but standing right there.Ricardo Darin makes her admirable cohort as Benjamin. His rank was too low, his salary too little, her presence too self-possessed for him to believe the hints he must have known she was giving. He's one of those men on whom a beard seems preordained. There's a melancholy about him. He has never stopped thinking about the murder case, and we get the feeling---although the movie is oblique about this---that the investigation was mismanaged at the time owing to Argentina's contaminated right-wing politics.Without being too open-faced about it, the film reconstructs the threads of two stories, the murder case and the fragmentary feelings between Benjamin and Irene. It's packed with lucid characters. There's fully drawn and effective comic relief Sandoval, played with a fine balance between gravity and lightheartedness by Guillermo Francella, is Benjamin's alcoholic assistant, rather sidekick, in the investigation, one of those drunks who may be bungling but is not hopeless. He and Benjamin, and all the legal-side workers, participate in the amusing ritual of referring to each other by fancy monikers. Morales is the husband of the dead woman, even now fanatically preoccupied with her death. Gomez has at all times been Benjamin's true suspect, and there is an astonishing scene featuring him in a soccer stadium that I have no clue how it could've been filmed, FX or not.The camera is like an omniscient character. There are many wonderful shots in the film, like that which opens the film and is later repeated. Various scenes take place that'll be retold later, using the retelling as part of Benjamin's evidence in the solution of the crime. The shots that are repeated somehow take on a greater dramatic force.Juan Jose Campanella is the writer-director, a gentleman who weaves a thorough (perhaps overly so), enthralling, adoringly constructed film, an epiphanic story where blinders are removed, suppressed desires are realized, self-limitations are accepted, the protagonist takes unusual actions, behaves oddly, anxious about the future. We get to fully know the characters, and the story details their complications and desires with fitting admiration. There is the continual feeling that they exist in the moment and not at some position along a predestined gamut. And though the film is a little bit overdone as I say, the cast doesn't act as much as it lives life candidly under invented circumstances.",9,2,3,13 October 2010
Black Book," One of the Greatest Films I've Ever Seen
","Carice Van Houten, an actress I've never seen before in a film, delivers one of the finest performances I've ever seen. One of the most beautiful creatures and most fascinatingly deep actresses I've ever watched, she as the heroine practically makes the movie what it is. Her character is very well-developed in the film's writing, to what I imagine is a highly personal extent, and to see her keep her feelings constantly in check, act under great pressure, show such self-reliance, and feel so heavily at once, not to mention sing so beautifully, is riveting to see.Paul Verhoeven is a director whose films have always interested me on account of the inextricable edge, something he cannot help but give all of his movies, even those he's made in the American mainstream like RoboCop and Basic Instinct. He is an artful director, but does not thumb his nose at bald representations of immorality, evil, ruthless violence, and also completely casual exposure to sex and genitalia. This does not make him self-indulgent or partial to shock value as many would think and as many directors are. What this makes him is a director who does what artists must do, and that is take chances. He is an unflinchingly bold filmmaker.The window into Verhoeven remains fogged. After 35 years and over a dozen films, the analytical outlook on the Dutch filmmaker should've by now congealed somehow or other, nevertheless, as with fellow agitator Brian De Palma, to mention him in cinephile crowds is still a capricious thing. Arguing masterpiece or monumental bomb for Showgirls and Starship Troopers is just the corner piece of Verhoeven's discordance. What keeps Basic Instinct and RoboCop from being acknowledged by so many 'serious' critics as the crackerjack works they are, on the other hand, isn't so much their standing as Hollywood thriller aerobics as their unapologetically turbulent manner, the persistent madness on the screen pushing us into wondering if he's for real. Yes, Verhoeven is for real, and never more so than when confronting religion. The visualizations of rapture and hellfire in The Fourth Man are too animal to be deconstructed into a crafty gag, while beneath the medieval raping, looting, and salivating of Flesh + Blood are eruptions of Christian images.What I shouldn't do here is beat around the bush about the cinematic style and how well-made the movie is, which I tend to do a lot because I happen to find production values and a story with depth and weight very important. What I should do is simply state that this film happens to have a lot of things that I always, without fail, enjoy seeing. The plot is loaded with revenge, intricate plots, sneakiness, impostors, and other such relative things. The screenplay is wonderful overall and, despite how much I know that American audiences will enjoy it, I believe that America could hardly produce a film so founded upon characters that are truly unpredictable in their stances as good or evil. The movie itself is of course anti-war, and the heroine is a woman even Satan could sympathize with. However, it also relies on a lack of conservative scrupulous judgment on the viewer's part. Sebastian Koch plays an SS officer whom Carice Van Houten's character must seduce in order to infiltrate the group of Nazis that have massacred her family and other Jewish refugees. But can the audience feel sorry for him? Can we recognize that there is a true individual beneath his politically horrendous exterior? Black Book scores as high as a movie possibly could in all of its departments, because the filmmakers have an honest, naked perspective on humanity and the truth about good, evil and that which is in between. And because of this, its characters are completely real and intensely affecting, its surprises are genuine to our intelligence, and we are fully engrossed. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen.",9,7,14,18 April 2007
127 Hours," Eliminating the Sieve
","Occasionally someone will make a huge misstep and get loads of time to dwell on it. Aron Ralston, the hero of the ninth feature film by the skillful, vitalizing Irish director Danny Boyle, has one of those. He goes hiking in the rough country without telling anyone where he's going, and then in a cavernous, constricted crevice, gets his forearm ensnared between a boulder and the canyon wall. What would you do? I'm not sure if I could've done what he does. It entails a grisly test for Aron, and for us. It's not always easy watching him do it. Yet, as always, from such traumatic roots, it's quite awe-inspiring what a compelling and gratifying film Danny Boyle has made out of it.As gut-wrenching as it is genuinely moving, this flashy, rousing but ultimately intimate and inspiring adventure docudrama fuses one of Boyle's most stunningly lively directorial efforts with an excellent performance from James Franco. For the bulk he contends with one approximately 10-foot-radius space, and one actor. There's a happy-go-lucky preamble in which Aron and a pair of young trekkers have a swim in an underwater cave. Later, in figments of the imagination, other people and pared-down events from his life appear to pop in.The film heroes who involve me most are not loud. They don't swagger to a beat, make lugubrious moral proclamations and restore faith in the inherent good of the world. They're common people confronted with a necessity and face their predicament. Indeed, Boyle interestingly enough refers to as his version of The Wrestler in regards to creating the portrait of an existentially desperate protagonist. Franco does first-rate work signifying the two necessary features of Ralston's character. He's a brash, overconfident traveler who trusts his dexterity and loves skating on thin ice, and, contrarily though it'd seem, he's got horse sense and animal instinct enough to do inconceivable but necessary things to himself to survive. One characteristic finds his predicament, and the other solves it.The question is, Can you take it? It's absolutely gripping. Films like this are neither fast-paced nor leisurely. They feel largely like they're all one moment. They exploit our profound nightmare of being confined somewhere and finding that there doesn't appear to be any means of escaping. Aaron is at any rate opportune to be standing on a stable footing. One can imagine the boulder lodging a little higher, leaving him suspended from the ensnared arm.Abruptly, his world has become very clear. There's the crevice, the sliver of sky above, traversed by an eagle on its recurring flight path, his camcorder, decreasing water and food and his insufficient little utensil. Who can hear him shout? The two girls have long since made tracks and won't realize he's missing. For anyone to happen to discover him is unimaginable. He'll die or act.Equal parts food for thought and triumph of the spirit, 127 Hours is a task in overcoming the unfilmable. Boyle employs superb cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, determining the immensity of the Utah wilds, and the extremely particular minutiae of Ralston's trivial ration of it. His editor, Jon Harris, accomplishes the subtle mission of showing his crucial act of bodily harm exclusive of ever totally showing it. For us, the nastiest moment is not an image but a blood-curdling, stomach-turning sound. Most of us have never heard this sound before, although we know precisely what it is.Torture and violence are so everyday in the movies. They're seldom amplified to the degree of true medical reality. We and the characters feel impervious. 127 Hours eliminates the sieve. It connects us. One aspect that cinema can indicate but can't induce is the violence of the grief concerned. I can't conceive of what Aaron endures. Possibly, that made it simpler for the real Ralston, because no matter how, his choice controlled the length of his misery.Boyle's stylized, claustrophobic drama warily doesn't make him a hero, more of a skilled sportsperson caught by a transitory determination. He could've easily been the guy in the adventure films whose bones and tattered clothes Hollywood characters find long after. He does what he must, which makes the film so gratifying. We could do it, too. The choice is in our blood, which chooses to go on.",8,0,2,29 April 2011
Finding Nemo," A Joyous Encouragement to Expand One's Experience and Acumen of One's Environment and Inhabitance
","Andrew Stanton's rejuvenation of Pixar by deep-sea adventure is a joyous encouragement to expand one's experience and acumen of one's environment and inhabitance. Look at Marlin, Albert Brooks' clownfish protagonist. In the opening scene, his wife is eaten by a barracuda along with all of their eggs, except for one. Marlin finds that egg and promises it he will never leave it, naming it Nemo. His journey is a testament to the catharsis and philanthropic imposition of chaotic situations, ones that happen within the context of the natural pitfalls of one's existential habitat. Parallel to his titular quest for Nemo is Nemo's own quest for the sanctuary of his father, and so in the superconscious of this deep-sea adventure, opposite energies are negotiated. Marlin's principle of orderly civilization, maintained by fear and the haunting wounds of his loss, is converged with the reality of messy nature. Stanton's precept paints the natural world with a wildly natural brush.The Pixar films are the American vanguard's long-overdue equivalent of Japan's Ghibli Studios anime films by Miyazaki and Takahata. The reason is that they are creating a new standard for American family films, filtering out the complacence and tampered ideology of the contemporary cartoon-animated Disney films and the like. This has, naturally, been ignored in pertinence to this particular film: The film's prominent use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animal as pets in America, even though the movie portrays the use of fish as pets with strong negativity and saltwater aquariums as elaborately tricky and expensive to maintain. In Vanuatu, clownfish were being caught on a large scale for sale as pets, motivated by the demand.But I believe a lot of kids know better. A movie like Finding Nemo portrays nature not only as something to fear and not only as something to seek out, but both, enmeshed in a sort of way that applies to what these characters, Merlin, Nemo, a flighty little regal tang called Dory with Ellen DeGeneres' voice, learn about themselves. They are oppressed by the sea's natural peril, but transformed by experiencing the very nature of the sea.The film has its handful of cornier moments, bits of humor that are meant more for the clean minds of wholesome children and their mothers, but they do not detract any more than they may in one of Steven Spielberg's more fantastical films for younger audiences. It nonetheless assumes you are absorbed in its world rather than popping it into the VCR during a birthday party. It makes sense, it tells a thematically diverse story, it has lessons, and it's moving. But more than anything, it's fun.",9,0,1,18 May 2009
Superbad," A Teen Sex Comedy, But Honest. We Call That A Paradox.
","Not only has the film been advertised incessantly with scenes of Jonah Hill in 1970s outfits and music from the '70s and '80s, but the film opens with a very funky '70s-style opening sequence with funk music. Then, the story begins, and the first thing that happens is a cell phone conversation, involving very up-to-date cell phones. At this point, you are taken quite aback. As the story progresses, you realize the acutely contemporary condition of teenage partying and sex among teens. What time period does Superbad think it's in?! The '70s motif confuses me to this second. It's something that can easily sever your tractor beam to the movie as the audience. However, this acutely contemporary look at the sphere of teenage sex and parties that I speak of is quite stunningly honest and poignant.The greatest charm of Superbad is how it laughs with us, as everyone knows that sex is not at all the way one thinks it's going to be like, yet our main characters, played by very brazen and loud Jonah Hill, nervous straight man Michael Cera, and iconic geek Christopher Mintz- Plasse most certainly do not know that. To put it very simply, it's the long-hoped-for antithesis to the American Pie films, which treat not losing your virginity before high school is over like the end of the world that nobody should be made to think that it is. They're tailored for an even younger audience than Superbad is, heroicizing wham-bam-thank-you- ma'am guys and girls that are too cool to give certain people the time of day, and romanticizing that naive yearning for sex when we're in high school. Superbad is quite hilarious and comfortable because of its honesty with the subject, not any sort of shallow perpetuation of fitting-in mentalities in pre-teens turning into teens.The boldest highlight of the movie, one of the funniest and most enjoyable things I've seen in a movie lately, is the plot strand involving Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as two cops who have no inhibitions with rebelliously fudging the law for their own good time and bringing the character well known by even those have yet to see the film as McLovin, played with a stunning dose of gawkiness by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, along for the rest of their shift, letting him do things like fire a gun and have beers with them, all leading to the message the film sends pertaining to people even older than those who will be seeing this movie and understanding the virginal naiveté of the characters. The film just hits a lot of notes that most teen movies of now don't bother to send, and in fact oppose.The script, written with great wit and both an ear and a memory bank for teenage dialect and mindset by Seth Rogen himself and Evan Goldberg, weaves the film along very gracefully throughout, clocking a day in the life, up until the tacked-on ending, which may just be a product of the intimidating demands of studios and audiences that feel deserted or confused without a film that ends like nearly all the rest of the teen movie bunch. Don't forget what it was like to be a teenager, before we wanted to admit that maintaing strong friendships is more important than partying and sex.",8,1,5,16 September 2007
The Great Dictator," Chaplin Talks! And Boy, Does He.
","Gambling with the set-in-stone Chaplin character developed over decades was daring, and it could backfire any time. The film's climactic sermon, for instance, spills over of schmaltz. When a dictator's imposter nervously approaches the loudspeakers, then starts to talk, Chaplin himself is inexplicably bootlegged into the story. He condemns repression and eulogizing social equality, but it collapses the farce and ends the movie as a lecture, followed by swelling music. It's terminal when Chaplin suddenly retunes the movie's strings, which might've been his purpose for making it.Chaplin speaks straight at us, in his own voice. No comic relief. Even as Chaplin acknowledges and utilizes sound's potential here, he reminds us of the more real assets of silence. For instance, Dictator Hynkel spurts a lengthy sentence to his typist, who hits a couple of letters. He bids a split-second expletive, and she types for numerous lines, tolling the carriage return. He's speaking pseudo-German, basically discontinuous coughs and stammers, with intermittent words like 'cheese 'n' crackers' and 'Katzenjammer kids.' When a pen won't abandon its holder, in exasperation it's just repetitive, abusive English. Sound mostly is just ineffective rage.There are other German terms that reappear among the claptraplike Juden. He's particularly keen on shouting these words, his face cramming the screen like Melanie Laurent's vengeful big-screen visage in Inglourious Basterds. Hynkel doesn't like brunettes either, but his counselor proposes pursuing Jews first. Then he can handle the brunettes and govern an entirely blonde world, himself the sole dark-haired individual around. He's so delighted by this, he waltzes with a bouncing globe to Wagner's strings. It's pure Chaplin, simultaneously fluid and silly. The nonchalant intermingling of terror and absurdity here and elsewhere is disturbing. It's not always hilarious and wasn't meant to be, but the celebrated gags and wealth of comic pantomime here are all indelible, a translation of the world into burlesque.Watching Chaplin's simulations of losing physical control, he appears to be truly collapsing into inopportune objects and people, but with accomplished, athletic poise. But it's not spoof or derogatory commentary. It's also not just the idea that totalitarianism can be deposed with hilarity. It's also the idea that anyone can be a fool. And the disconcerting result of Chaplin's becoming Hynkel is that he gives him some of his own charm. Hynkel doesn't actually dictate so much as take counsel, fantasize, love himself, throw tantrums. He's too timid and persistently uncomfortable around the sunny, unsubtle Napaloni.Chaplin relegates world history to a string of acts and caricatures sponged from his own work. The Gestapo are adaptations of the big bully who'd been chasing his Tramp since his dawn period. The Jews communally befit a Tramp variation, tender, crafty and reasonable in a mad world. Paulette Goddard reprises her enchanting urchin, but she's not so innocent here, with an enormous amount of rugged sex appeal. It's not much of a riposte to Nazism's upsurge. But Chaplin was up to something else. Ultimately, the Nazis aren't condensed into comic-strip clowns, but elevated to a much broader human madness.The movie's charm rests on the link Chaplin draws between the little guy and the oppressor. The brutes chasing Chaplin as prey are under the auspices of Chaplin the predator. He's his own tormenter and the voice of defiance against his own madness. The casting keeps tying what its plot undoes. The barber momentarily wielding a razor over someone's throat seems more threatening than Hynkel ever does. Hynkel in his demure moments essentially acts like the barber. In the climactic sermon, Chaplin begins to tirade like Hynkel. Wrath with good intentions is still wrath. He attacks the dictator in everybody, and his equating of oppressor and oppressed not only suggests that the clown could've been the evildoer but that even the good and the victimized, characterized by the world's favorite clown, aren't to be entrusted with such power. Chaplin's best extra hint, having made his authoritarian silly, is to evoke how much destruction even silly folk can cause.",8,1,2,28 October 2011
Hot Fuzz," One of the Most Brilliant Comedies I've Ever Seen
","Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, 'S*** just got real.' Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.",10,313,362,30 April 2007
The Others," Unusually Thoughtful and Affecting Ghost Film
","The reason Amenabar's work on The Others is so above the fare of a given ghost film is because it turns out to be a beautifully philosophical musing on death, how death is something even the dead are not prepared for, because the psychological fear assumed on earth overpowers the physical seamlessness the real thing may have. There is also an honest undercurrent of perspective on how religion may effect the mental state of afterlife, complemented by another concept that may or may not be hopeful or comforting to people, which is the idea that spiritual and materialistic connections in this life may carry over into the next.The film flows gently like the English countryside it portrays, patiently executing a brilliant build-up of seemingly purposeless events and phantom motives that serve as exterior for the perfectly coinciding ones that later reveal themselves.The multi-talented Alejandro Amenabar, who wrote, directed, and also scored the film, has crafted an unusually thoughtful and affecting ghost film. Nicole Kidman's nerve-shattered, heart-ravaged performance as the strict Catholic war widow who spends her life protecting her two photosensitive children gives just the right conservative, classical yet realistically drawn upon approach. Christopher Eccleston, playing Kidman's husband, may be quite dull, but Alakin Mann and James Bentley, playing Kidman's children, are either not from the assembly line of cryptic horror movie children or they're from a fresh batch.",8,1,2,6 February 2008
Brokeback Mountain," More Touching Than Most Heterosexual Love Stories I've Seen.
","A lot of my friends think I'm some woman trapped in a man's body, or in a nutshell, less respectable, because I freely admit that I cry at movies. These friends of mine are either very shallow, or much less secure with themselves than they appear to be. Either way, I came out of this gem of a film crying until the streaks of tears running down my face dried and hardened my skin into a thick, sticky glue. I don't think I've been touched by any love story between a man and a woman the way I have been by this man-to-man love story. It infuriates me to know that this movie has had such a hard time because it's about a gay male relationship. I mean, in the year 2006, people are mad because a movie comes out that they don't have to see about a couple of dudes.I went to a local theater with a friend of mine to see it, having found that it was finally playing in Cincinnati. Up until the day before, I was constantly checking theater listings here on IMDb and finding that it was playing almost everywhere, except for southern Ohio, not to mention a few of the southern states. I was excited going to see it, finding an incredibly long line of people leading into the theater.I was enjoying the movie until, fifteen minutes into it, a voice sounded over the entire theater. It boomed, 'Attention, attention, attention. There has been an emergency reported. We ask that everyone please evacuate the theater through the exits on either side of the screen.' And so, we all evacuated. I'm wondering whether or not it's a fire, but when I saw three fire engines, three ambulances, and an uncertain number of intermittent police cars, what other conclusion could I draw than the likely possibility that it was a bomb threat. I'm sure there was no bomb, but the theater has to follow procedure. They have no choice. I went to see it again the following week.Cincinnati is not the only place where we have to worry about the desperate, inexplicable measures of religious or political fanatics whenever we want to see a movie. In Salt Lake City, it was banned. They claimed that they didn't want children to see it and be influenced by the homosexual activity in it. However, they are letting Hostel play there. You remember in Hostel when those people were mutilated with chainsaws and that guy held a blowtorch point blank in that girl's face, baking and disintegrating it? Why are these people not worried about their children being influenced by the gruesomely sadistic activity in Hostel?It's difficult to be influenced by homosexual activity. Homosexuality is a natural sexual orientation. A gay person is born attracted to their own sex just like a straight person is born attracted to the opposite. It's naive to say that homosexuality is a choice. Try it yourself just to make sure. Let go of your inhibitions and choose for a day to be attracted to your own sex. Try to fantasize about them. Even try hitting on them. Unless your are naturally attracted to men or women, you won't truly be.Look at it in terms of common sense. Who would choose to be gay? Being straight is safe, because that's what the majority of the population is. Being gay is a much harder life because you have a much smaller number of people to choose from, and you're constantly oppressed, perhaps even beaten to death like Matthew Shephard. Which would you choose?Oh, and by the way, remember Bound? It's another great movie with two gay protagonists. However, they are lesbians. Do you recall this much protest at any point with Bound? No. So let me get this straight. Girls having sex with girls is cute. Guys having sex with guys only gets them the attention that Mr. Shephard got in Laramie. Huh. Well, I must say, that boils it down to incredibly self-centered and ignorant male-dominated society, not to mention a pathetic weakness and insecurity in men that almost makes me ashamed to be a man.Brokeback Mountain is one of my favorite films now, and it really stimulates emotion the way a love story is supposed to. Ang Lee's brilliant direction keeps the film at a steady, constantly brisk pace at the same time it keeps the film in a low key, in a calm, docile mood, no matter how jarring or tear-jerking it can be.If you want to knock it for having gay guys in it, go ahead and knock all the other gay guys in history: Tennessee Williams, Margaret Cho, Christopher Walken, Joe Pesci, Nathan Lane, Stephen Sondheim, Edith Head, Alan Ball, Gus Van Sant, Alan Cumming, Walt Whitman, Jean Cocteau, Alice Walker, Charles Laughton, Nigel Hawthorne, James Ivory, George Cukor, Billie Holiday, Tchaikovsky, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Francis Poulenc, Anthony Rapp, ad infinitum.",10,31,36,12 September 2006
Ed Wood," You Can't Help but Root for the Underdog
","When Tim Burton makes a movie about Ed Wood, one assumes it would be some sort of an ostentatious lampoon, as in Mars Attacks for instance. Wrong. Ed Wood is either a stroke of luck for Tim Burton in regards to acquiring great material it's kismet for him to helm, or what I truly suspect, which is that it's a deeply personal and knowing labor of true, joyous passionate love and mature, careful craftsmanship.Whether or not the movie is totally accurate as a biopic doesn't matter. It's about more than just an account of Ed Wood's life. It's about a passionate young storyteller breaks down doors, bares his soul, deals with merciless criticism, estranges relationships and fights the system only to prove himself an infamous hack and laughing stock. He was eccentric, relentless, even a little delusional maybe, but he could've been anyone.This is the film I would argue proved Johnny Depp as an established, certified great actor. He captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood surviving, owing to a hilarious capacity for seeing the silver lining in the blackest cloud. The script imagines him as a model American dreamer, an idealistic underdog with little to be so hopeful about, since he was also a model American failure.Something people forget is that Sarah Jessica Parker is a good actress. Something people take for granted, though, after the millennial works of Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola and Jim Jarmusch, is this early example of colorful departure casting by Bill Murray. But the stand-out is the landslide hallmark of Martin Landau's long career, totally disappearing into a darkly hilarious rendition of Bela Lugosi.It's not just Landau's amazing performance that makes him stand out though. Really, at the core of the movie is Wood's friendship with Lugosi, who he genuinely loves, and who comes to depend on him. We see Lugosi alone and withdrawn in a tacky little house, settled in the hollow melancholy of his faded glory and addiction. His first scene is an exquisitely crafted gag showing him trying on a coffin for size. And Wood is able to relieve the despair, if just fleetingly, in a last-minute streak of roles which gave him amplified renown, as the star of some of the most legendary and respected horror classics ever made, and then of some of the most infamous and derided.",10,2,2,26 January 2014
Insomnia," Standard Fare But With Interesting Themes
","On one hand, when you see Insomnia, you've seen it all before. On the other hand, there is a theme that makes it fresh and entertaining rather than a wasteful rehash of scores of other cop thrillers about catching a tricky murderer in a small town. The story takes place in a small Alaskan fishing town where a local teenage girl is found murdered. An LAPD detective played by the inimitable Al Pacino, along with his partner, are sent up to lend a hand in the investigation, working with an eager local rookie played by Hillary Swank, still crisp and unpolluted by her job. Now, at the same time, a severe Internal Affairs inspection back in LA is inevitably going to put Pacino under a tornado of scrutiny and indictments. And he is, indeed, guilty of planting false evidence against at least one suspect in an earlier case. He worries that a lot of of his legal convictions will be annulled if Internal Affairs learns the truth. He does not want his life's work ruined, nor does he want these offenders released. Early in the movie, his partner discloses that Internal Affairs has proposed an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony. Pacino tries to talk his partner out of it, but he, seemingly complicit in some way in Pacino's crimes, says that at the end of the day he has to take care of himself and his family first, so he thinks he has no choice other than to agree to the deal.All through the film, Pacino grows to be increasingly unbalanced because of shooting pains of shame over another big cover-up that occurs when he concocts a shrewd scheme to bait the killer back to the crime scene, and angst on account of the menace of being exposed. Swelling his disorientation are the phone calls he gets from the killer, who does not distinguish himself, but who knows of Pacino's regretful deed and about his effort to conceal it. This is the reason, yes, but from the moment he arrives in this small town, his entire biology is confused by the perpetual daylight of Alaskan summer.How much longer can he lug this load of liability? How would he normally if he were not in a place so out of his element in so many ways? How intricately can one function if an essential bodily purpose is not met?Robin Williams ascertains his bona fide acting chops in this film, not only because it is a serious role as a villain in a thriller but also because the amount of control he is capable of having over himself, allowing himself to subordinate to a story that does not entail him playing himself. Whenever he plays a serious role, he does show just how multifaceted and complex he is not only as an actor but as a person all around. His villain actually projects that unpredictable sudden adjustments from one moment to the very next.This enjoyable thriller is not on par with Christopher Nolan's fascinating previous film, Memento, but in his helming of it he does show that he can make an effective film if he subdues himself and refusing to give in to experimental progressions of nonlinear storytelling or elaborate twists and other plot elements that don't do much but telegraph how clever he is. Insomnia was a chance for him to sharpen his skill with atmosphere and the power of hiding. And what a cool atmosphere this movie has, a dismal snow-covered town of only a handful of people, almost like a dream.",10,0,0,17 September 2008
My Neighbor Totoro," Miyazaki's Absolutely Hilarious, Culturally Significant Story of Existence, Location and Expedition, Rather Than Rivalry and Danger.
","This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.Miyazaki's films are in particular viscerally entrancing, using a watercolor look for the backgrounds and working within the unique anime tradition of characters with big round eyes and mouths that can be as minute as a fleck or as enormous as a cave. They also have an spontaneous authenticity in the way they mind minutiae.The movie tells the story of two young sisters who share a wonderful bond. As it opens, their father is driving them to their new house, near a boundless forest. Their mother, who is ill, has been moved to a hospital in this community. Now think about that. The film is about two girls, not two boys or a boy and a girl, as all American cartoon films would be. It has a resolute and loving father, in contradiction to the recent Hollywood affinity for selfish or absent fathers. Their mother is sick: Does sickness happen in American family cartoons?A neighbor boy later tells them their new house is haunted. But not haunted in the American sense, with ghosts or forbidding creations. When the girls let light into the shadow, they get just a peek of little black fuzzy dots scampering to refuge. ''Probably just dust bunnies,'' says their father, but there is an old nanny who has been employed to look after them, and she suggests that they are ''soot sprites,'' which like empty houses, and will pack up and leave when they hear laughter. Perhaps I'm reading too much in, but during this scene, I feel like I caught a brief reference to Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, as one sister stares transfixed at a crack in the wall.Assent to how the father composedly receives their account of arcane critters. Are sprites and totoros for real? They surely do in the minds of the girls. So do other hilarious beasts, such as the Cat Bus, which bustles through the forest on eight fast paws, its big eyes working as headlights. Instead of letting the children be scared of hauntings and the soundness of their own minds, the elders teach them to like and enjoy it all. They go along with it rather than irrationally making them feel silly.While it's not necessarily clear whether or not the adults actually consider them, not once does Miyazaki trot out the relic children's literature adage of The Adults Who Think The Child Is A Liar, So Child Is Going To Have To Save The World Without Them. This welcoming approach to accustomed Japanese spirit-creatures imparts a telling distinction between our two cultures. In America, there must always be something to fear, always a scapegoat, always something or someone to antagonize. No matter how equally violent or aggressive the history is of Japan, they do not thrive on fear factors. It is a beacon of great hope and pleasure to me that family films are the rudimentary place where cultural difference is easiest to discern in the movies.My Neighbor Totoro is made of existence, location and expedition, not on rivalry and danger. This is made crystal in the engrossingly extensive sequences involving totoros, which actually are not Japanese myth, but were indeed created by Miyazaki specifically for this movie. In these sequences, Miyazaki gets no mileage out of any trite ideas about the dark and dreadful forest. It's only nature. Is the film sometimes corny and absurd? Yes, but it knows when to be quiet and real.One of the funniest scenes I think I've ever seen on film occurs when the girls go to meet their father's bus. But the hour grows late and the woods grow dark. Without a sound, matter-of-factly, the giant totoro joins them at the bus stop, standing to one side as if it's been there the whole time. It starts to rain. The girls have umbrellas, and give one to the totoro, who is fascinated by the raindrops on the umbrella, and jumps up and down to render free a downrush of drops from the trees. Watch how coolly and constructively the scene has been handled, with the night, the forest, the lateness of the father seen as a circumstance, not an omen. The movie needs no villains. I remember that Winnie the Pooh also had no evil characters at first, but that in its new American version evil weasels have been interposed into his benevolent setting.But it would never have won its worldwide audience simply owing to its fuzzy heart. It is also full of mortal humor in the manner in which it perceives the two exceptionally authentic, realistic little girls, and I refer to their characterizations, not their physicality. It is side- splitting in the scenes involving the totoro, and in the scenes with the ridiculous Cat Bus. It is a little tearful, a little hair-raising, a little out of the blue and a little enlightening, just like life itself. The film expresses a refreshing ideology with Miyazaki later deepens and defines in his more recent films. Look at the minimal amount of external things in these girls' lives, or their father's, or the nanny's. Their story exists as a situation rather than a plot, and suggests that the uncertainty of life and the makeshifts of invention afford all the enterprising escapades one needs.",8,6,8,6 May 2009
Juno," Cute. Period.
","What Juno is is a cute film. It's not great, it's not beautiful, it's not hilarious. It's cute. It's from the Wes Anderson/Jeffrey Blitz/Dayton-Faris school of film-making, an eccentric independent comedy made on a so-so budget that prefers the deadpan and understated way out. It puts to good use tangible social touches like the hamburger phone, the different expressive clothing styles of the teenage characters. But let us please stop giving Juno so much kudos. I simply do not understand this. 2007 is a year of almighty standard-setting American films. Why are we putting this one so high up on a pedestal? If American audiences are to praise a film of this effect, why has there hardly been any recognition congratulated to Blitz's Rocket Science, a funnier and much more insightful film within this said school of recent indie cinema?At first Juno seems almost socially handicapped with the way the title character acts when first meeting two prospective adoptive parents for her unborn child, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It seems as if Juno intends to shock them with her opposition to verbal self- control or formality. It's not unclear as the story builds that she is unaware of what kind of person she is thus her approach to people is like a take-me-or-leave-me compensating attitude. The scene is not directed to par.Overnight Hollywood success story Diablo Cody's script gives Ellen Page, a great young actress who gave an unreal performance in Hard Candy, a machine gun barrage of zingers, one-liners, and wry comical references to music and cinema that she turns out to be Woody Allen reincarnated as the hip, cocky, middle-America teenage non-Jew.The ending also goes in the wrong direction for a film that we all are finding so touching. It does not leave me with the right spirit its ending should have. I will make it clear though that I do not want my resentment for this film's random accolades and popularity to distort my view of the film itself. I will close with my overall verdict on Juno, which is that it is a cute teen movie with just enough laughs, decent performances, and obscure references for me to have enjoyed myself.",7,1,5,18 May 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," You Know What? It's Absolutely Fun.
","I was a complete sucker for the effects this time. I have grown to dislike franchise films based on the starving and then desperately feeding sweets to mainstream American audiences, the sweets being computer-generated visual effects. Well, this one got me. Gore Verbinski, the director of all three films in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, has a deep, intuitive understanding of the fear, drama, and peace that can be derived from water. The film may not have the brilliantly elaborate sword fights that its predecessors had, but there are many unbelievably dazzling sequences involving pirate ships and the effects the gargantuan ocean has upon them. Horizons, whirlpools, the deep, reflections of the starry night sky, and waterfalls all have their heydays in this epic pleasure of a glossy Hollywood film.The story is an extensive, elaborate, complicated, extremely verbose one, and most adolescents and children prone to Disney films will often find themselves lost. That is no judgment on their intelligence, only on the expectations the writers have of their target audience. I, however, thought the story hardly left anything to be desired. The fantasy elements of the series are induced with great creativity, as opposed to many fantasy films, which usually tend to have stories that center around incidentally fantastical worlds, with invented creatures, completely objective goals like finding a ring that controls the fate of a race of beings. The Pirates films are actually heavy on plot, and in this third installment, the travel between this world and the afterlife in Davy Jones's Locker is cleverly done. The humor is also becoming more daring, with cynicism, and extreme dryness that is not R-rated, but gives off vibes as though it is.Johnny Depp has become such a sizzling hot property, and since his nuclear burst of popularity in 2003 has widdled to a universal liking by all and a box office fueled by a stalker's obsession among angsty 13-year-old girls, that the filmmakers have become extremely self-conscious in their handling of Captain Jack Sparrow. I was impressed very much by his introduction in At World's End, which was very fresh and not so corny emerging from a coffin with his guns in his hands across his chest so that the audience can cheer. It brims with happy-go-lucky creativity, but the gimmick is carried too far by being continued and built upon in several scenes throughout the rest of the movie. But I won't deny that there are points where it gets interesting. If I'm being vague, it's because I don't want to spoil it.One thing I'm definitely becoming concerned about is the amount of violence that's being allowed in Disney films. Smokin' Aces was released in January, and it was a mêlée of grinding, shrieking action violence complete with several gruesome shootouts and a couple of snippets of torture. It was rated R, and no, it was not released by Walt Disney Pictures, but by the standards being set by this film, which opens with a child amongst a line of condemned being prepared for hanging and has a surprisingly disturbing scene wherein Davy Jones's tentacles impale a single man's head through each orifice, it very well could be. During Smokin' Aces, or any other R-rated action film recently, I was not disturbed, and did not make an irksome face, at any violent scene, though several are shown and the body counts are high. In this PG-13-rated film, there were three sequences where I grimaced. Why would the violence be harder in a film designed for kids that is given a much more generous rating than a film designed for older people that is given a very standard rating that is given away like confetti at a parade? Anyway, the verdict is that it is one vastly entertaining epic ride where the characters, as they always are in the Pirates films, maintain an interesting and hairpin-turning arch throughout the series, and the performances by Depp and Geoffrey Rush are as charming as ever. This is coming from a film buff who begrudges billion-dollar franchises founded upon treating audiences like junkies who are so numb and disabled that all they are able to eat now is ice cream.",8,23,37,28 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," One Can't Fault A Superhero Movie For Being A Superhero Movie
","Spider-Man 2 was a masterpiece of character drama that managed to keep an audience of comic book fans and superhero buffs and kids gripped even during large gaps without action. It was incredibly riveting and the cinematography was never corny the way it tends to be with many superhero films and especially Sam Raimi films. It was a landmark. Spider-Man 3 is fine, but it just doesn't hit as hard. I'm not feeling anything for it right now. I know it's a good movie, but I saw it yesterday and I forgot until now to write my review. It's not a forgettable movie in the sense that you're indifferent the entire time. It's just another comic book flick.I think part of the problem is that I'm for some odd reason fickle in my viewpoints on several things in this movie, and I'm usually very hard-headed about what I think of a movie, right down to the last frame. For instance, the story seems very contrived and constructed rather than led to, but on another hand, the almost ad-libbing, seemingly improvised script draws interest from the audience. Examples include that there's a Sand Man, but there's also an alien venom. Or that Harry still wants revenge for his father's death and won't listen, but he will, but he won't. Peter gets pushed around and handles it in unpredictable, self-destructive ways, but will Spider-Man still save the day? The audience desperately wants to know, not just for their sake but for the togetherness of the movie, how all of these strands are handled and woven together by the end.Another thing I'm torn about is the episode of the film dealing with the venomized spidersuit, where Spider-Man is influenced by the black alien venom. This isn't a spoiler, so don't worry. You see that in the trailer. My problem with it is that that is my favorite part of the movie, because I enjoy everything he does when he wears this venomized suit. I think the audience is supposed to like certain things he does to an extent and certain parts of it are meant to be productive to him and thus making the venom addictive, but I happen to commend all the vindication and rebellion by him in the duration of this part.I'm certain of a few things, though. One of them is how the Sandman, played by the odd casting choice of Thomas Haden Church, comes to be the Sandman. It's ridiculous, completely not believable, and even though one can't fault a superhero movie for being a superhero movie, there are certain things that need to be believable. I can't stand not giving it away in order to explain it, but I want those who are reading these reviews on here to be able to use them for what they're meant to be used for: Persuasion and direction of one's expectations. The reviews with spoiler alerts serve no purpose, because you can only read them after you've seen it. What's the point? Anyway, I do however find a lot of the special effects pertaining to the Sandman to be awesome, especially in the first scene where he appears, falling apart but still moving and gathering up again.So the verdict is that Spider-Man 3 does not surpass its predecessor and perhaps in film series that are constructed continuations for the sake of franchise rather than large-scale stories that last that long to be told simply can't be as memorable because of how many times we've seen the same characters already, almost like an episode in a television series. But, it is very entertaining in that fast, fun, undemanding Hollywood way.",7,0,0,9 May 2007
Match Point," A Seamless Convergence of Philosophical Matters and Unfaltering Emotional Experience
","Match Point, an utterly absorbing and stimulatingly tight experience, seems to imply that you can just commit any horrible deed you want and get away with it, but really, we have to accept that life is arbitrary and existence is indiscriminate, often an insignificant and dismal experience with no purpose, and that love relationships are exceedingly arduous, and that in spite of everything we need to stumble on a way to not only survive but lead an honest and gratifying life. Many interpret that what the film is saying is that anything goes, but I think it essentially poses the matters: given an impossible situation in which we're all alone, how does a certain individual persevere, or even why should he choose to persevere? Sure enough, the choice is hardwired into him, and us. Spiritual people don't want to allow the truth that cancels out their myth. And if it is an arbitrary life, they're bust.There are masses of us who choose to lead totally self-interested, careless lives. They feel, because nothing signifies any absolutes and one can prospectively get away with anything, they will. But one can also make the choice that we're alive, other people are alive, we're all hanging by the same interdependent threads and we've got to try to make it as honorable as we can for ourselves and everybody. This is why Match Point's story makes such perfect sense to me, because this is so much more virtuous and even much more Christian. If you accept the uncomfortable reality of human life and choose to be an honorable person despite it instead of living in denial that there's going to be some sacred prize or some penalty, it feels more sincerely dignified. If there's a prize or penalty and you act well, then you're acting well not out of such selfless intentions, the same professed 'Christian' intentions.The lack of God in the universe matters, however. It's a shame, and yet just when you can acknowledge that, ironically, can you then continue to lead what people call a Christian life, namely an honest, just life. You can only truly lead it if you recognize what you're up against at the outset and shuck off all the fabrications that lead you to make choices in life that you're making not truly for honorable reasons but for securing a nest egg in the next world.Match Point is a millennial fable about class, the unpredictable reversals of destiny, the base thirst for gaining access to the social echelons, and living with skeletons in the closet. And this shifty fable of social luxury merges Allen's droll scripting with the puzzlement and difficulty of making such crucial life choices. Our main character likes the easy life he's married into but is claustrophobic. He's a character who gives us no traditional, conventional or ethical reason to care about him, but we follow him and hope that he gets what he wants. It's not that what he wants is bad, it's that it's a shame that that's what he wants. But this is his life at thispoint. This is all he, and we, have. What difference does the outside world's morality make if the outside world has no bearing on his truest feelings and doings.It's a silky ethical dilemma, well thought out to its very last shot. Much of the story's friction grows from the expectation that our man will soon be exposed. This genre anticipation is generally gratified in stories concerning infidelity, deceit or higher crimes. Also, not that this is by any means one of his comic efforts, Allen also draws on the British setting to infuse a dormant sort of social satire technically reminiscent of a comedy of manners, which also brings the convention of a class impostor. Allen outwits the anticipated finale by having the decisive clincher work opposite its conventional purpose as the straw in the wind.It's this understatedly amusing and roguish attitude merged with such an acutely urbane and stately atmosphere that makes Match Point not actually a homecoming to form for Woody Allen but one of growth: an elegant piece of gliding camera movements, artfully composed shots and seamless edits. He gives conceptions of his characters and tensions with palpable sharpness. But honestly, Match Point is a story intended more to demonstrate a line of reasoning than to observe a societal situation or a certain cast of characters. It is one of the very few film experiences that is at once an object of scholarship---an exemplary merged perspective of the contemporary cultural and environmental situation as a psychological and anthropological school of thought---as well as a seamlessly inflected emotional experience---insatiably carnal abandon, crossed with the pervasive social pressure for gaining right of entry to privilege and money, and living with shameful secrets you can never, ever, share or confess to anyone, that you must carry with you to your grave, when you cease to exist.",10,0,1,14 October 2010
Midnight in Paris," Just What the Doctor Ordered
","I liked every single little thing about Midnight in Paris. Woody Allen, one of the most astonishingly prolific writer-directors in American film history, after a consecutive string of anxiety-induced dramas about the cruel indifference of life, he has finally given release to a well-deserved and surprising reflection. Believe me, reflection is the right word. Without compromising his signature melancholy longing, Woody has woven an utterly breezy, life-affirming and still personal and hilarious comedy, populated by a charming and sometimes joyfully surprising cast who look to be enjoying themselves, and the buzz is infectious. In a now rare ecstatic mood, he daydreams about youth and the excitement a young writer urgently wants to preserve before it becomes smothered in the dehumanizing daily grind, takes that stress and calmly, confidently drifts into a world he romanticizes with such warm, savory atmosphere and a true master's storytelling economy, and coming to a perfectly aimed close, where the story should and must end, and with tidy reconciliation it does, and boy, do we hate coming back to reality when the lights go up.As per his usual, Woody provides one more couple at the apex of marriage and finds conflict in that universal clash between security and passion. Hollywood screenwriter Gil and fiancée Inez have accompanied her parents to Paris and the excursion shows up their differences in a most prickly manner. She's all about shopping for priceless chairs while he wants to take midnight saunters in the rain. Indeed, he loves Paris so much he wants to move there, an idea she rejects like he's nuts. Meanwhile, she grows impressed by an conceited, know-it-all professor, who precludes every pontification with 'if I'm not mistaken,' the satire being that his enlightenments are usually untrue. One evening at midnight, dismayed by the seeming trajectory of his life, Gil bails on her to walk alone. As he sits down to pull himself together, an antique car drives up.Revealing any more would be a cruel deprivation of your pleasure taken by the amazing grace of the film's fluid, elegant surprises. The crisp pace, firm cutting and old-fashioned invisible style leave you longing for more as the movie whooshes by in 94 minutes of enchanting pleasure, what they always meant when they used to say 'movie magic.' The indomitable soundtrack includes some of Cole Porter's most remarkable songs. The smart period and present-day chic wardrobe and sumptuously arranged interiors are also entitled to year-end awards acknowledgment. Woody, who claims indifference to his work so frankly, clearly takes delicate care of the filming of his stories.Characters in his 42nd film, aside from but not exclusive of Gil himself, have a sole crucial attribute which really provides the actors scope to have loads of fun with their roles. The ensemble is enormously exuberant in their typecast character parts. Cotillard is the right choice for the charming pixie-like spirit who distills and unravels Gil's passion, but McAdams has the high-maintenance modern young American woman down pat. She is the ideal distillation of how most of Europe views us, and brings real emotions to Inez that inspire our genuine reactions. No surprise. Woody's invariably above marginalizing female roles.Surprise is in the welcome familiar faces we stumble upon throughout. Adrien Brody's priceless take on a certain Spanish cultural icon, for instance, is delectably memorable. But it's a gem in a convention of gems. Wilson is Woody's best-ever casting of someone else to personify his customary self-doubting and hung-up character. Expressing obsessive sentiment with witty jousting and the ubiquitous dread of death are consistent with the deep-rooted Allen opus. You surprisingly don't wish he were a young Woody instead as he injects lots of wide-eyed ingenuousness along with just the right dash of the director's classic nebbish.Wilson makes Gil so genuine, so keen, about his hero worship of the experiences he's mysteriously introduced to. He can't believe them, the refreshing humility and worldly genius of them. Essentially, he's leading with his nose here. Both it and his performance are engagingly bent, as is commented on subtly in the most brilliant in-joke manner in Brody's scene. That's it. Starting now, no more spoilers of any kind. This is hard for me, but necessary. The trailers don't spoil it, but now the reviews are everywhere and audiences have flocked to it. But by jove I'm doing my part to preserve it for whatever it's worth.I think of aged burgundy or antique clocks in regard to the spirit of this hilarious and exciting little film. It begins with a montage of postcard-worthy tableaux of the City of Lights in the sunlight, in the rain, and then in the sunlight again. It's a musing, a reverie, clearly. But what gives it such an ebullient sense of wonder is its eternal central theme. The story, in its clear-cut but understated way, proposes that no matter what period we're in, we take its value for granted. So we reflect and see superior days gone by. And yesteryear, naturally, is a discriminatory daydream. Allen's profound esteem for the film's deliciously romantic universe doesn't stop him from giving it an old comic pro's joshing as well. It all works self-assuredly and sublimely on its own conditions.One would think some moviegoers might be baffled by this annual release from the filmmaker, just as they deeply are by one out of your average three Woody Allen films, since cultural literacy is hardly ever brought to the movies anymore, to say the least. And yet, it's success in theatres is wonderful. Perhaps in an economy like this, just as screwball romantic comedies were celebrated in the Depression, this is the pure ideal for what the movies need more of right now. So many moviegoers take Allen for granted, though Midnight in Paris has and will captivate even the most worn-out old-hand moviegoers. There's nothing not to love about it. Either you relate to it or not.",10,2,5,24 October 2011
Zodiac," Filmmakers Will Learn From This Film
","The very first thing I will mention about Zodiac is its absolutely brilliant cinematography. The constantly dim lighting, the washing of scenes in tan and taupe, the overall grittiness, capture powerfully David Fincher's seamless attention to ardent period details. Every single spec of the screen is at all times ensured as a precise replica of the time in history that the film portrays. That includes perfect costumes, even when people are dressed shabbily and informally, hairstyles, and other visual touches in that field. The use of music of the times is very effective, executed in a similar style as Scorsese and Spike Lee would tend to place certain retro hits in scenes of violence and montages, meticulously and subtly manipulating the volume. The scenes wherein we are given glimpses of the Zodiac's cruel work have great dramatic effect. Overall, the atmosphere of this film is scrumptiously dark and eery, even though the majority of it follows the three men leading their own branches of investigation.This film, as wonderfully made as it sounds, spoils itself with its excessive length. I am usually one of those people in the audience who savors a film that runs two and a half or three hours, because I think longer movies tend to leave a deep impact, they're more passionate, and they have longer, more drawn-out stories and even single scenes. The problem with Zodiac is that its length is unneeded. There is a bit that can be cut. Because the movie runs longer than it should, the effect of the cinematography, the period details, and the dark atmosphere lose effect. Like most good things, too much can spoil your appetite. By the arrival of the last forty-five minutes, one is full. And by then, perhaps because the movie realizes it needs to cram the information it hasn't given yet, it becomes more of a seminar on the Zodiac killer than a story, the characters explaining and the closing texts that true stories often end with being too much and too long. The movie does not decrease to the point where it is bad. It simply tapers in impact.The cast is great. Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, and Jake Gyllenhaal create very realistic people. Robert Downey, Jr. plays himself, rivetingly and entertainingly, even if his end of the story could easily be a good deal of what could be cut. Chloe Sevigny delivers well, the timid element of her role being usual for her and the straight-laced maturity being the opposite. Brian Cox serves a bit of dry comic relief in his role as a laid back yet tightly wound doctor with a hint of snobbery.",9,1,5,4 March 2007
Milk," A Much-Needed Biopic of Perhaps the Most Important Politician of the Last Half of the 20th Century, As Well As a Blow to the Nuts of Prop 8
","After seeing Milk, a much-needed biopic of perhaps the most important politician of the last half of the 20th century, I have a renewed respect for Sean Penn. He is among the contemporary powerhouse testosterone-heads like De Niro, Pacino, Hoffman, Hopper, Nicholson, you know, swarthy New Yorkers who use heavy method acting despite today's cynicism towards it. He was at one time the prototypical Hollywood punk who punched extras and photographers, did drugs and chain-smoked. Here he faithfully and lovingly reflects one of the most honest, understanding and loyal people in history, to an extent that none of his said peers have shown the balls to.I see this film as not only a product of incredible dramatic and visual talent but also a righteous breakthrough of humanity in a most trying time for it. We never hear about the countless important gay men and women in history, but now Gus Van Sant, himself gay, has at last given us an accessible mainstream movie about one of them. To prove a significance for themselves today, when their basic rights are still being challenged, they, and we, have to relate to one of them in the past, as this film makes clear.Harvey Milk became the first openly gay American elected to public office. He made a prevailing plea to closeted gays to come out to their families, friends and co-workers, so the straight world could stop vilifying a theoretical, nonrepresentational perception. But so influential was the movement he was key in motivating that I believe his demand has now virtually been regarded, apart from some willfully primitive regions of the country.Van Sant's masterpiece begins with Milk remembering into his tape recorder about an individual passage that sparked at the ripe age of 40! At that cut-off point, he grew discontented with his life, determined he wanted to really accomplish something. A Republican stock researcher, he mingled with hippies in Greenwich and tiptoed the closet door, waving out hesitantly. He was in love with Scott Smith, played so becomingly by the underused James Franco. This is all absorbed from one scene, shot in a single, mostly stationary take. They moved to San Francisco, opened a camera shop and saw that even America's leading, most strident gay community was being methodically victimized by police.What made Milk such an effective politician was that he didn't go into politics as much as he was pressed by the motivating proof he witnessed every day. He ran for the Board of Supervisors three times before being elected. He campaigned for a gay rights ordinance. He organized. His tongue was always in his cheek yet he always helped as much as he could. He built a coalition with liberals, unions, longshoremen, teachers, Hispanics, blacks and others with shared needs for equality. He ripened his gift for public relations. He became an invigorating spokesman. By now branded the Mayor of Castro Street, he secured public office. It was an oppressive platform from which to confront firebrands like fagnostic Anita Bryant, who Milk would taunt with his wisdom and confidence by calling her always by her first name.Beautifully crafted, enveloping massive amounts of time, people and spirit without a frame of half-heartedness or drained momentum, this tenderly handled picture tells the story of its hero's ascent from disgruntled middle-aged hippie to nationwide icon. Entwined are his romances. He remained dormantly in love with Scott after they separated due to his political concentration. He is instinctively caring even of a second lover who becomes irrationally resentful of his political life, when the practical thing would be to sever the bond.His most critical rapport was with Dan White, an apparently straight fellow supervisor, a Catholic who said homosexuality was a sin and canvassed with his family in red, white and blue. A thorny pact formed between Milk and White. If I were to criticize the film at all, I would lament that the depiction of the camaraderie between Milk and Mayor George Moscone is given far too little screen time.There is no misstep in the taut, multi-faceted screenplay, the potent cast or the first-class technical film-making. There is not one shot that isn't given rich creative nuance. What's more, the film is so faithful to its period that it seamlessly uses stock shots wherever possible, opening with archives of police raiding gay bars, then Dianne Feinstein's announcement that Milk and Moscone had been assassinated. Knowing Milk's story beforehand didn't make the archival candlelight march at the end any less overwhelming. It was the effect of one man's resolution too late in his life for him to have ever expected. Milk adopts emboldened importance after the victory of the appalling Proposition 8 as an electrifying honor of a key gay figure who would be raising hell right now.",10,7,14,15 December 2008
The Prestige," One of the Smartest Films Recently
","The Prestige is a film founded upon wit and intellectual conflicts. The Nolans don't want to challenge the audience as much as they just want the audience to know how brilliant they are. And they are! The Prestige is spectacularly brilliant and full of terrific surprises and excellent twists. For any moviegoer who gets a great kick out of a battle of wits, a game of revenge, and an all-around sneaky plot full of schemes and cons and tricks, The Prestige is the movie of the year for you.The cast is very convincing, especially the two leads and Caine, who after half a century in movies will never become too weather-beaten to pack a punch, enjoying the tricks they play on us as much as Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are. The Nolans, though they love to show off a bit, in this case by tacking one too many surprises, they are not yet on the road to self- indulgence like many of today's most impressive auteurs like Shyamalan for instance. They will no doubt be knocked by a few critics by Christopher's use of elaborate, multi-layered nonlinear plot structure, telling two flashbacks at the same time while driving the story with the present day. Following, Memento, and even Batman Begins have flaunted the nonlinear technique to the point where, like Tarantino, they will be accused of using it as a gimmick. However, this technique comes in very handy in building the tension in the story. The film is somehow able to surprise the audience after its already shown us the outcome of something.Once again, it spills a little overboard with its twists and turns once it's satisfied the audience with a dazzlingly brilliant climax, but overall, the film is brilliant and weaves one of the finest suspense threads in awhile.",9,3,6,21 October 2006
The Terminator," Tired of the Franchise? Don't Forget It Stands On Its Own Legs Quite Well.
","Given that the world can take this movie completely for granted now, one can forget how gradually Cameron unravels what's happening with the two nude men who emerge one night from a torrent of voltage: One, a colossal Germanic beast, dispatches of a crew of punks to obtain their clothes first thing after he instantaneously regains his orientation. Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over: Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter. The second nude, Michael Biehn, doesn't have the same massive figure or imperviousness, but he has the vigilance and taut physique of an animal, stealing clothes too, managing to pinch a gun.By this stage we're beginning to note that this smaller man may not entirely be so formidable like the other, as he's conspicuously not killed anyone yet, but we still don't understand how any of it relates to the opening title card describing a war between humans and machines, or why both men have such a concern with the three Sarah Conners in the metro area phone book. It swiftly becomes clear to us which of the three is the one who counts, as we meet her in the form of Linda Hamilton. We see how tedious her life is, with her co-worker observing, in what we don't yet recognize is irony, that in 100 years, nobody will care. Then Sarah finds on the news that someone with precisely her name has been viciously murdered. Thinking little about it, she arranges for a night out with her roommate Ginger while the LAPD, led by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen, have to manage the second execution-style killing of a Sarah Connor in one day.We still don't know what's happening, theoretically at least: We saw the giant man murder the initial Sarah, we're not familiar with the second, and neither man has yet verified himself as trustworthy the slightest bit. So when the smaller man manages to begin stalking our Sarah, we've every cause to presume that he's trouble, and so does she, having by now gathered the murders lead straight to her. She dodges into an ascetically '80s club to call the police and disappear. Two presumably deadly, anonymous, wordless men hunt the same woman in the packed nightspot. At least one now has a substantial arsenal. Eventually, half hour in, one says his very first line of dialogue: 'Come with me if you want to live.' With hero and villain now conclusively determined, the movie's remainder is utterly a chase, Schwarzenegger pursuing the two humans through LA, slaughter and nothing else on his agenda. I remain unendingly stunned by how superbly Cameron sustains the tension: Unquestionably in that first half hour, there's not one second that's missing heart and soul, when even the essential exposition of Sarah's life is managed with utmost effectiveness. Even in the enormous info-dumps that Biehn is burdened with, we have no sense of the film slumping under the load of it all. When he bothers to tell Sarah, and us, the plot in essence, it comes directly after a climactic point, when we're viscerally prepared for the film to let us decompress.There's the cost-conscious way that Cameron shares information about Biehn and Schwarzenegger, ensuring that we'll be engrossed in deciphering who they are. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned. Sarah as a convincing, appealing person is much due to Hamilton playing a young woman of no seeming significance pushed into a nightmare and never permitted to find her balance. This is usually the part that feels like just a bookmark, but Hamilton emphasizes her uncommonly distinctive sense of a woman in an '80s killer-stalking-girl flick.Biehn, never my favorite actor, nevertheless seems a sinewy, astute beast as much as a human. It evokes the frantic anguish of his future life, and makes us pity this tattered endurer. Meanwhile, the epically iconic rogue of the film: It takes authority, and in Schwarzenegger's case, a grand succession of close-mouthed expressions, tweaks of the head. He may be a machine, but he's a convincing one. It's a categorically star-making performance.Cinematographer Adam Greenberg encapsulates a grimy, murky world, scattered by overpowering fluorescents. Stan Winston's Terminator endoskeleton is the stuff of legend, even if some of the animatronics in certain shots are charmingly old-fashioned. Of all the collaborators, still, it's composer Brad Fiedel that merits the most affection: His throbbing, techno-flavored theme leads one of the finest film scores throughout all the 1980s, and it's maybe the best instrument Cameron has to use in maintaining the film's propulsion. It's exciting, dissonant and harsh, that unremitting bass line keeping the movie seeming like it'll never brake, not unless the menace is quelled. Cameron's assurance in his material brings his debut far beyond the standard of all the other films where the screenplay is merely a cause for explosions and car chases: It's a plot with import and desperate interests. Though the characters may be standards, they have persona, and their future is an issue of sincere apprehension.",10,2,3,7 September 2011
Cloverfield," Truly Brilliant Technical Film-making Applied To A Usually Dull Class Of American Cinema
","Cloverfield transcends the reputable superficiality of Hollywood monster and disaster blockbusters. It goes beyond the simple eye-rollingly indulgent gimmicks and effects. The combined effort of the filmmakers results in a technical masterpiece in terms of suspense. There is an incredible intensity to the story and an extremely impressive relentlessness overall. This is due to the effect of revealing only what is observed through the camcorder incidentally held by only two or three of the film's characters, the reason according to the story why we are privy to any of what goes on at all.It is preposterous for any consumer camcorder to endure past a 300-foot drop as it eventually does here, but nevertheless this technical device does so many wonders for this riveting monster film. It causes the viewer, if the viewer does not remain obstinately opposed to the film's identity as a Hollywood disaster movie, to be absorbed entirely in the story rather than the film-making. The movie's world becomes all too important to us because of how immediately and naturally this gimmick tears down the tangible obstruction between audience and on-screen life. Cloverfield succeeds at something the vast majority of American movies strives to do in this generation, which is tell a story while flaunting directorial style that appeals to the young eyes trained by the high-tech nature of this day and age. The film's premise, a video file recovered from a digital hand-held camera by the US Department of Defense, relies upon the organic use of a camcorder's perspective, a perspective which because of its accessibility ironically seems so much more immediately familiar to our eyes than 35mm film or computer-enhanced color-corrected hi-def video.Cloverfield is a truly scary movie that, despite its depiction of college-age characters with a huge social circle and a Manhattan setting, achieves a nightmarish claustrophobia. Though so much happens and on such a large scale, we only see so much, which is the object of unfolding a story on film. One cannot deny the effect of a giant monster that military is firing at with desperate force yet we cannot see, or destruction seen vaguely from the realistic faraway vantage point, or seeing straight from a character's perspective when they fall victim to alien predator.",8,0,0,21 July 2008
Catch-22," Gem of 1970
","Catch-22 is one of the funniest black comedies I have ever seen. It's full of great sight gags, more daring versions of run-of-the-mill army jokes, satirically realized characters that are written to take devastating aim realistic versions, et cetera. Aside from all of that, the reason that it is all so funny is because of the surrounding point of it all: Alan Arkin's character simply cannot escape the binds of the military regulations and rules, which come in the form of an endless stream of subtle catch-22s. The premise of course is founded upon the catch-22 that Arkin faces when trying to be declared insane so he doesn't have to fly anymore missions, a hilarious boundary of opposing yet still compatible reasons, but throughout the film, a flow of smaller catch-22s decorates the plot. I haven't read Joseph Heller's novel, but having seen the film, I can say it's a brilliantly delivered satire.The film's zipping pace adds to the tongue-and-cheek tone of the movie. Mike Nichols almost always brings an acute intensity to the style and pace of his movies, and so in this film, the story is told through overlapping scenes, fixated cinematography comprised in several scenes of one long take, blaring and constant sounds, and grippingly animated performances from the cast.Alan Arkin, Anthony Perkins, Bob Newhart, and Jon Voight deliver most of the laughs, all of them somehow assigned to different roles for humorous delivery. Arkin and Perkins, though their characters are very different, are the livewire physical comedians, Newhart is the gawky neurotic butt of schemes and chains of cause and effect, and Jon Voight is the dry exaggeration of the coldly, proudly capitalizing American entrepreneur.Catch-22 was made in 1970, beginning a decade of the most potent crop of films there would be until the turn of the 21st century, the later spurt of cinematic high points lasting a lot shorter than a decade, for now in America, our films have developed a peculiar pituitary disorder in which the maturity has receded greatly and reduced itself to a childlike state. Let's face it. There really aren't too many great films right now. More legitimately put, you can't just walk into any movie nowadays with the sure feeling that you'll enjoy yourself. You have to choose wisely and carefully now to make sure you don't spend two hours watching a contrived, formula-deformed disaster. Catch-22 is the perfect example of the creative intelligence, sophistication, and razor-sharp talent that went into movies in the 1970s.",10,5,10,19 March 2007
Snatch," A Music Video Populated by P.G. Wodehouse Characters Updated to Modern London's Crime World
","Cinematic prototypes lean toward having an agelessness about them, an idiosyncratic appeal that exceeds years and settings. A relatively new model has been trying its frontier, the consciously stylized gangster. These incessantly stylish, exaggeratedly talkative, morally vague antiheroes have crowded the cinema backdrop. An exciting cross-reference to the question of whether or not the stylistically cutting-edge criminal is consistent and attention-grabbing enough to last is put into high-gear in Guy Ritchie's sophomore raid on the modern London gangland. Packed with jump-cuts, high shutter speed, a loud multi-generational pop soundtrack, harsh locales, style-sprayed dialogue and heaps of comic irony, Snatch. can be seen as the premier template for hyper-stylized testosterone cinema of and since the new millennium, except a closer going-over---and you'd not be in the minority if you gave it numerous---exposes something even more thrilling.Snatch. is essentially a manic fusion, mongrelizing the Gen X and Y movie gangster with a varied range of archetypal potboiler constituents. Indeed, there are enough quaint, glib villains in it to give Mamet, Tarantino and even Scorsese at least a blip on the radar screen of their challengers, but at its core is a classic caper comedy. It's not ridiculous, actually, to picture Cary Grant playing Mickey fifty, sixty years ago were that heyday the time for this fast-paced amalgam of the underworld mythologies of the fixed boxing match and the diamond heist. Ritchie is the cinematic counterpart of a disc jockey, sampling traditional British thriller plotting and mixing it with ultra-modern atmospheric ingredients to form a witty and exhilarating mélange.Ritchie's rearing in commercials and music videos give Snatch and its chronic freeze-frames a gasping pace, owing to cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones and editor Jon Harris, who move heaven and earth. John Murphy's score lightheartedly varies on Jewish and Slavic formulas that sustains a tongue-in-cheek tone of buoyancy, at the same time the production design suggests one after another frayed London lower-class scene with stark naturalism. Ritchie keeps everything whirling frantically and cheerfully along, with all the audacious excitement of a bright kid intoxicated by the utter thrill of flying his own kite.The chaotic, tricky plot is given its much-needed bookends by Turkish, an unlicensed boxing promotoer attempting to expand by dealing with formidable figures like many-tentacled crime lord Brick Top. In an effort to rig an impending match for Brick Top, Turkish solicits Brad Pitt's movie-stealing gypsy Mickey, who appears incapable of correctly taking a dive.Across town, a flawless gem has been stolen by Benicio Del Toro's unassuming Frankie Four Fingers, who is expected to deliver it to America for Cousin Avi. Though, as one might imagine, there are snags: Rade Serbedzija's calculating Boris The Blade wants the diamond, and it's up to hired gun Bullet Tooth Tony help retrieve it.As the film begins to unfold, the various cliques of characters appear to trail independent fates until Ritchie's cunning script lures them together in the last 40 minutes. Less domino-like in structure than Lock, Stock, Snatch manages these innumerable brackets of people and interlaces their paths. The dialogue is lively like its predecessor's, though cheekier instead of riotous, while composed in the same breed of Cockney Runyonesque.The quality of more peripheral performances is conspicuously flimsy, but let's not lose sight of the overall upshot. The performances fluctuate in quality, but all are distinguished by a good-humored liveliness. Big splashes include Dennis Farina's frustrated American Avi, excavating a cornucopia of crass-American-traveler humor, Vinnie Jones' pokerfaced drollness as a more gentlemanly, if bullet-toothed, variation on his Big Chris in Lock, Stock, and Alan Ford's menacing eccentric Brick Top. Of exclusive reference is the impeccably cast dog that features more significantly in the action than we initially expect. Less flashy, but softly holding the whole lot together, is Jason Statham's bone-dry breakthrough as Turkish, who along with his sheepish partner, the memorable Stephen Graham as Tommy, gets more than he bargained for.This indelibly quotable audience fave is far from faultless cinematic art, but it's an electrifying exercise and a halcyon cult-smash stand-out by Ritchie. For those who grieve for the old Ealing comedies or the farces of McCarey and Wilder, and don't disapprove of a spot of gunplay, blood spatter and dismemberment, or an immensity of profanity generously strewn throughout, this is a refreshing and stirring experience. May the post-modern gangster standard keep on coming, as long as they keep as imaginative, as hilarious and as absorbing as the hyperlink tapestry of Snatch.",10,0,2,14 October 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," For a Chess Player, He was One Hell of a Filmmaker
","Kubrick's cynical vision of the progress of technology and human stupidity assumes the delighted impression of a film that got away with something. LBJ was in the White House, the Republicans were priming Goldwater, both sides considered the Cold War with bleak gravity, and the world was learning to get used to the term 'nuclear deterrent,' which meant that if you kill me, I'll kill you, and then we'll all die. 'Better dead than Red,' several believed. Others believed the reverse. The options were not attractive. The Bomb eclipsed foreign policy.Then the great BAFTA-winning expatriate's masterpiece of satire, paranoia and straight comedy released with the power of a splash of ice water. What Kubrick's Cold War send-up illustrated was not men reliant on machines, but vice versa, particularly the mad Gen. Jack D. Ripper.Proceedings on Ripper's army base are interconnected with scenes aboard one of the B-52s, and with an urgent assembly in the Pentagon's War Room, still one of the most unforgettable sets ever built for a movie, with its immense world maps impending over a vast committee with an undaunted sphere of light above it.The screenplay, by Terry Southern with Kubrick and Peter George, twists this premise into a black farce, clarified by bursts of sharp satire. Some of the dialogue has penetrated our lexicon. The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British ambassador, who doesn't have the correct change to call the White House and save humankind, is one of the movie's most exceptionally brilliant gags.If Sterling Hayden creates a scowling, unreasonable Gen. Ripper, George C. Scott is inspired as his foil, Gen. Buck Turgidson, who chomps gum, gnarls his mouth, and discloses one statement of dire straits after another to the President. And Sellers, as president, has a succession of awkward hotline exchanges with the Soviet Premier that slashes nuclear annihilation to the degree of an excruciating social faux pas.The defining passage on a subject so crushingly unpleasant that all one can do is laugh, Dr. Strangelove has the highest form of verbal humor: The self-destruct device self-destructed, we learn, and you can't fight in the War Room. And counter to the theoretical deliberations in the Pentagon, there's the uncomplicated nationalism of the B-52 pilot, Maj. King Kong, who assures his crew there's going to be upgrades and streamers everywhere. His departure from the story stays one of the most recognized moments in contemporary cinema.The one part of the film, still one of the finest political satires, that doesn't quite succeed is the War Room sequence that comes between Pickens' rowdy ride and the ultimate nuclear montage. Sellers, as Strangelove, quarrels riotously with his disobedient bionic hand, yet the dialogue doesn't seem to go anywhere, and the scene feels peculiarly unproductive. In an earlier shot in the War Room, we've seen an elongated table covered with cakes and pies, and it's understood Kubrick meant to end the scene with a pie fight. Dr. Strangelove would've been perfect if he kept in the climactic pie fight. That's true brilliance. Without it, the film truly does feel as if it's missing a final scene.Regardless, seen after over half a century, like a morbidly sick Looney Tunes short it feels extraordinarily crisp and unsullied, a lucid, impudent, treacherous lampoon. And its eagerness to pursue its scenario to its commonsense close has an integrity that today's spineless gift-wrapping mechanics would almost certainly sidestep. Its black and white photography aids, moreover, putting an unembellished visage on its lethal political absurdities. If movies of this derision, cleverness and rancor were still being made, the world just might be better at staying on its toes.",9,2,4,26 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Good, the Bad and the Totally Unnecessary
","This, the first film ever to use Lucasfilm's now pervasive THX sound technology, is both a seasoned movie and a fresh one, not only as the one 1997 Special Edition that I did not see theatrically and recently saw (!) but also as the initial film. It ends the chronicles of the pivotal human characters in the series, mainly Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. It brings back other characters who seem either more or less than human, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, and the darling robots C-3PO and R2-D2. I wonder how fascinating it would've been for Chewy, 3PO and R2 to have arcs the way the humans did. After all, humans seem to be the minority in this galaxy: In this sixth and consummate episode in the Star Wars saga, we meet various inimitable characters, including the implacable Jabba the Hutt, who is like a goiter that was possessed with a life of its own and grew and took control as an evil leader of other strange beasts; the adorable, fuzzy Ewoks, the mammalian aborigines of the forest moon of Endor; a terrifying desert monster made of sand and teeth, and obnoxious little rodent creatures that hasten across the corners of the frame. And there is an admiral for the Alliance who's like a sapient dinosaur who began a career as a general and statesman. These are the most intriguing characters, to me, anyway, which is never more apparent to me in the original trilogy than in Jedi, with its overtly trite soap opera passages between Han, Luke and Leia that resemble General Hospital more than anything else.Regardless, one thing this film and its two predecessors never do is blow much time on establishing first acquaintances. Unlike countless visual effects and monster movies, where new creatures are introduced with elaborate entrance moments, each of these films immerses its alien creatures into the heart of the action right away. That's possibly why the film has such visual ebullience. Jabba's throne room, for instance, is peopled with countless oddball creatures, some of them just half-gleaned in the periphery of frame. The camera in this massive soap opera coasts nonchalantly past organisms that would supply the highlight for other movies.There's a whirlwind chase through a forest, aboard airborne motorcycles. After many of the bad guys have run into trees and gotten pulverized, you find yourself wondering why they couldn't have just flown above the treetops, but never mind, it wouldn't have been as much fun that way. You could probably guess that my favorite Star Wars film is Empire based on what I name as my favorite sequence, where Jabba and the bounty hunters take our heroes into the desert on his hover-barge to be fed to that terrifying sand and teeth monster, because I find great inherent tension in any scene where the characters are hovering above a depression in desert sand inhabited by this creature, in whose belly 'you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.' The director is Richard Marquand, whose previous film was the wonderful dramatic thriller Eye of the Needle which, aside from mainly being a great character-driven performance piece, evinced his deft hand for suspense.Now that I've discussed the initial film, I will close by discussing the Special Edition, the turning of a 134-minute movie into a 135-minute movie by means of a solid minute of garbage. I'm speaking mainly of two features that likely aren't news to anyone reading, the first being the awful dance sequence in Jabba's throne room early on. I cannot comprehend why one would wedge in a set piece that drags the pace and provides brainless shots of aliens doing modern pop dances. Maybe I'm a purist, but a film that was an unheard-of spectacle fresh to the technological vanguard in 1983 should not delude itself with modern-day trivialities. The second objectionable annex is the ridiculous Hayden Christensen superimposition in place of the original elder Anakin Skywalker's spirit. Why in hell would Luke see a vision of his father that he never knew? Other than that Lucas wanted to merge the external chronology of a series of films spanning several decades, it has no other purpose but to annoy me personally. My own little opinion of Lucas' career and what he's done to and for the film industry could be boiled down to this: Just because you opened the door for the next generation of filmmakers doesn't mean you have to hinge your career on opening more doors, because some or most or all of those doors will be Pandora's boxes.",8,1,3,23 June 2010
MASH," Hooray!
","MASH is, purely and simply put, a great whoopee cushion on a condemned man's electric chair of a movie. It appears to be heartless and mean-spirited, but it is quite derivative of laughter. Really, that's a testament to the film itself. The film is about medics and nurses during the Korean War who, when they're not sewing a mutilated kid's limbs back on or something to that effect, are constantly making targets for pranks and practical jokes out of nurses and authority figures and even potential patients. There is a sadness lurking behind this hilarious comedy that comes through in Robert Altman's lyrical dryness and cinematic stoicism despite what manic things happen on screen, and that sadness is derived from the fact that these ironically cruel and coldly funny doctors can only survive the tragedy of the war, the details of which they stare in the face every day even closer than the soldiers themselves on the battlefield, seeing every nook and cranny caused by every bullet, bomb, knife, grenade, and whatnot, if they betray their feelings and project completely carefree personas.Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould are a great male comic buddy team, the likes of which I haven't really seen in awhile. I haven't watched any Abott and Costello films or Eddie Murphy cop films lately, but I used to all the time, and Gould and Sutherland reminded me of how simultaneously corny and fun a comic duo can be to watch. I simply love watching them together, as they are funny in the most basically goofy and masculinely physical way. Tom Skerrit is their third banana, just as able a comedian but with not as much screen time together as Sutherland and Gould do, as they form a terrific, very real guy-to-guy chemistry with each other that captures that very truthful ambiguity between close bonding and arm's-length buddy-ol'-pals that we all experience.A great counterpart for them on screen is Sally Kellerman, the unamiable nurse with an affinity for the truly bad person that Robert Duvall cleverly and realistically plays. Kellerman is the constant butt of their purposely sexist and humiliating high jinks and gags, and in one scene near the middle of the film, she explodes with tearful anger to a commanding officer, hilariously and pathetically unleashing her completely unladylike, ungraceful, manneristically unattractive pure form, which is a brilliant touch.MASH is yet another wonderful gem from the 1970s, a decade ripe with enough of the greatest and most important American films of all time to last through decades that need that compensation. And for those seeking comparison between MASH the movie and MASH the television show, I love the television show and grew up on it on account of my mother, who was once a fanatical viewer of it. I think the show is hilarious and very very sharply written, especially in the middle to later episodes. But I think the show was more like an after-school special when it came to delivering the message that MASH initially conveys, whereas MASH the film sends it in a more refined and artistic way where we pick up on it by experiencing the nature of the characters. For those looking for a comparison between MASH the film and Catch-22 the film, two war satires based on controversial novels both adapted in 1970 that went through a friendly competition for success, I will tell you sincerely that I love both of these films equally, but if you're looking for a more intense and fast-paced film, see Mike Nichols' Catch-22. MASH is wry, cold and cynical, and it works beautifully that way.",10,1,4,23 July 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Some People Can't Escape Their Fate
","I haven't liked a single Guillermo Del Toro film that I've seen. I didn't like Mimic, Blade II, or Hellboy. That's not all he's made, but that's three strikes. I felt like that would be the last of the Guillermo Del Toro films that I'd see, until Pan's Labyrinth comes along and gets tremendous praise. I thought, well it actually looks good, and I'm sure every director, even the lesser ones, has his day, and so I decided to see it. I saw it, and I was disappointed.The movie has atmosphere, which I always like. I like how the film never leaves the Spanish cabin and the woods that surround it. And I also enjoyed the magical creatures, the good ones and the bad ones, when they were actually shown. The problem with the movie is that it's so uneven that you come in not really fully knowing what to expect and then somehow leave with the feeling that you haven't gotten what you expected.The film takes place during the Spanish Revolution, and attempts to center around one little girl's adventure into a world of fairies, gods, and heavenly creatures, the Revolution being the antagonist that may keep her from reaching the etherial life as the princess of this world. This is hardly effective because the movie is 80% Revolution and 20% fantasy. The audience is subjected to waiting through scenes, even violent and action-packed ones, instead of enjoying them. This is not because these scenes are badly done or boring, but because we didn't come to see a movie about the Spanish Revolution and the evil of the little girl's warlord father. We came to see a fantasy. The scenes of fantasy are very enjoyable, but in all, they probably add up to about a half hour. The remaining hour and a half is lost focus.Pan's Labyrinth is uneven in many other ways, too. For instance, it's a fantasy about a little girl, but it's rated R. The film is advertised like any other fantasy film, much less a fantasy film about a little girl, and there's nothing R-rated about it. So when we see that R rating, what are we to expect? Right up until the second I sat down in the theater, I had no idea what I was seeing. All I knew was that it was called Pan's Labyrinth. And it's because the movie doesn't know what it is, what it's about, or who it's about. Is it a fantasy about a little girl, or is it a drama, or is it both, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about a fantasy world, or is it about the Spanish Revolution, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about the little girl or is it about her father?Maribel Verdu's performance is terrific, as is that of Sergi Lopez, Ivana Boquero, and Ariadna Gil, and the cinematography is beautiful, capturing the atmosphere I speak of, but they hardly effect one who is watching a completely unfocused story. I think that's the end of the line for Guillermo Del Toro in my book. I gave him one more big chance after three strikes, and he still couldn't quite cut it. Benicio Del Toro is a fine actor, but his brother should maybe work for a publishing company or something.",7,4,9,21 January 2007
Knocked Up," Plays the Consumerism Game and Releases Astute Communication
","Knocked Up did its applaudably, insightfully wise job. It lured its conventional teen target consumers into a hard-to-miss universal social commentary. It is stunningly enlightening and intelligent, not in a vernacular or high-brow sense but emboldeningly sharp in its assertion of wisdom and sensibility within the mainstream American culture of regular pop culture-driven people of today.Judd Apatow is so honest and wise in his portrayal of the all-American knocked-up situation, that everything makes sense despite how stupid things are. Take for example the most obvious and necessary scene in the movie, which is when Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl get drunk and wind up at her house having sex. Rogen is battling to maintain an erection and fit a condom on while keeping the pace. Heigl gets impatient and says, 'Just do it!' Of course, she's trying to speed up the fastening of the condom. But also of course, he interprets that as 'Forget the condom, let's go.' This clearly pivotal moment in the movie could so easily have been botched.Apatow is very much above the stick figure story. See, a lot of the time when Hollywood wants to make a commercial movie with a message pertaining to an oft-confronted conflict in or because of American culture, they simply take a classic scenario and fill in the blanks, which would just be character names, place, et cetera. Knocked Up begins with its characters. It also sets the stage for hilarity at their expense. Rogen is not just a horny American Pie party animal. He's an immature Jewish Canadian who is building a website of all the great nudie film scenes with his LA pothead friends. He lives there and doesn't pay taxes, living on an injury settlement. Heigl is a competent, together, motivated woman who is promoted anchorwoman for E! TV and lives with her sister, who is married with a family. She goes to a nightclub because she is rewarding herself with a good time and he goes to the same nightclub because he and his friends spontaneously decided to go. This pairing is an extremely socially and psychologically perceptive comic manipulation. Their occupations and immediate social personalities are specifically and deeply opposing.It's not just a farce, however. It takes itself seriously. Seth Rogen's character's personality is actually a good model for describing the climate of the film. It's hilarious with a whip-smart sense of timing and comeback, yet it isn't simply a breezy clown because there's so much aggression and passion behind it's sense of humor. This leaves room for the most comfortable and considerate poignancy in a Hollywood movie directed at young people in years. All of the couple's fears and mutually irritating idiosyncracies naturally threaten the delicate situation that they try so hard to take with a grain of salt, and their own friends and family become infected with the same feelings between each other. Heigl's sister, played by Leslie Mann, is in the most typical hetero marriage in the world: an unhappy one. And because of their close sibling relationship, their instabilities and uncertainties complement each other.Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen are hilarious together and Jonah Hill, whose natural over- the-topness works well in the subsequent Apatow/Rogen film Superbad, here playing one of Rogen's stoner friends, whips out many a razor-sharp laugh line. The dialogue in this film is so absorbing, hilarious, smart, rhythmic and quotable that David Mamet, Quentin Tarantino, Neil Simon, and Dashiell Hammett are surely seeking to visit Apatow for inspiration. No, I wouldn't rank Knocked Up with the likes of Glengarry Glen Ross, Pulp Fiction, The Goodbye Girl or To Have and Have Not, but it's certainly the cinematic speech beat for the present American pop culture. It has its fingers vigorously pressing against its pulse.I know I'm building this film up a wee bit, and I should in all fairness report that the movie struggles to begin. The first five minutes or so strike dread into one's heart because the rap blaring over the soundtrack, the shots of Rogen and his buddies partying, and Heigl's existing-condition life look like one's in for a simple coasting through Hollywood 16-to-25 age group fluff. Nevertheless it certainly overpowers its brief early expectation by a landslide.",8,7,14,2 March 2008
Alien," A Masterpiece of Suspense
","Ridley Scott opens Alien in a completely foreign atmosphere, with detailed images and objects that we've never seen and detailed sound effects that we've never heard. The camera moves around slowly and quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right under our noses. The commercial spaceship, the distance it is away from earth that's impossible in this age and surely for another several decades, the planet the characters land on, and practically every means of doing ordinary things are all, well, alien to us, and we cannot help but feel bewildered and tense. The scenes of suspense are some of the most powerful I have ever seen. You cannot watch certain scenes in this film without being caused to jump. Ridley Scott is such a cognizant and clear-minded director that he has built the entire film around the seemingly incidental effects it has on us.The story is original, and somehow very naturally disturbing. Everyone is away from home, everyone has a lifestyle that doesn't even exist in the present-day reality, the science-fiction creations are all twisted imaginings. The plot hardly takes any turns. It's actually rather simple, and yet every scene is unpredictable, the writing is truly scary, and literally everything is done right, right down to the handling of the character of Jonesy, the cat.The creature itself is a disturbing, vivid creation. I mean, have you ever thought about how odd this thing is? It looks almost like a Frankenstein's monster of machinery and mechanical parts. When it is first seen, we hardly even realize that we've seen it. That is how scary this movie is.",10,1,3,6 July 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Thankfully Not Interchangeable With a Theater Production and Distinctly Cinematic, Atmospheric and Voyeuristic
","At this point, I feel Tim Burton has redeemed himself after Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's certainly his best movie by far in almost a decade. It has a spectacle-centeredness that is better tamed in this Burton film than his last few. And that's because it does something very surprisingly rare in movies, which is deliver truly, deeply, savagely satisfying revenge. Seeing the film being my first time experiencing the story of Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber, the film's story is a very pleasant surprise. Most bloody revenge films are anemic when it comes to the pay-off, like Carrie or The Prestige for instance. Burton does not disappoint in his handling of this material. Sweeney Todd gruesomely goes for broke. It does not hold back on the bloodletting. The blood's theatrical color in giallo style has an excitingly insatiable effect.Being an adaptation of a Broadway musical, it thankfully doesn't detach me with the expected light and prancy demeanor. Its tone is very gritty, it's historical London atmosphere a masterpiece of art direction, and it does with an adaptation what I think is truly effective, which is stand on its own without the source material by making it inextricably cinematic. Dante Ferretti's Victorian London is, like his L.A. in De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a city of the consciousness, space tinted by disfigured perceptions. The musical numbers are very tightly directed, a lot of them very voyeuristic in a way that a stage production could not be.Johnny Depp's performance is a very convincing one, further severing the tendency for Burton's films to have a detachment that makes them less compelling and more forgettable. He oozes dominance, a more imposing Depp than what we normally see him do. Alan Rickman matches his emboldening presence with another intriguingly infuriating villain.",7,1,2,18 April 2008
The Best Years of Our Lives," A Convential Topical Film
","William Wyler was inarguably a supreme Hollywood craftsman who thrived under the studio system from the 1930s to the 1950s, an important example for today's filmmakers to discover and follow. His painstaking methods with actors are cruel and insensitive, though there is something to be said when he has directed 31 different Oscar-nominated performances by 31 different actors, 13 of them having won. What is so important about his film-making style is his subtle language that holds complete bearing over the tone of his films, a technique based on long takes and the dramatic possibilities of deep focus shots.This suitably extensive film begins right after WW II, as discharged servicemen played by Dana Andrews, Harold Russell and Frederic March meet while hitching a ride home to a Midwestern city in which they all happen to live. One was a captain and bombardier who still endures from nightmares of combat. Russell had been in the Navy and lost both of his hands with mechanical hook prostheses in their stead. March served as an infantry sergeant fighting in the Pacific.Wyler himself was commissioned a major in the Air Force during World War II and on his return to Hollywood shot The Best Years of Our Lives. Having such fresh and similar experience to his characters, this should have been at least as powerful as The Heiress because of how personally he perceives it, just as he did The Heiress. And while it holds touching passages, this epic hometown drama does not pack the wallop it promises. It is a traditional melodrama about the troubles of servicemen struggling to be relevant to life in postwar America and readjust to the lives to which they return, and as this it is good, not dull or badly made by any means. Despite a flat performance by Russell, one for which you can't blame him, for he never was an actor before but a serviceman himself who trained paratroopers with explosives with an outcome identical to that of his unfortunate character, this film is capably dished up by its especially good performances by Fredric March, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and Hoagy Carmichael, who can act out dialogue while playing the piano, in addition to clever deep-focus setups.",8,1,1,4 September 2008
The Town," Contrived, Hackneyed, Schmaltzy, Conventional, Spectacularly Entertaining
","There are certain scenes in The Town that skillfully use the psychological commands we insistently hurl at movie characters. For instance, Ben Affleck's fond of Rebecca Hall. If she sees the tattoo on the back of Renner's neck, she'd find out something she can't find out about him. Jeremy Renner without warning meets the two at a counter. With firm looks and behavior, Affleck hints at him to leave. We do, too. Renner aggressively loiters. He doesn't know the tattoo's a tell. If a film can carry us to this situation and make us feel angst, it's done something correctly. Nevertheless, the dialogue so often feels forced, especially in the film's mid-section. John Hamm is given many lines that act more as self-conscious metaphors and similes---'This isn't Tommy Hopscotch anymore,' or 'This is the not-effing-around crew so get me something that looks like a print because this not-effing-around thing is about to go both ways'---than as steps to create tension or reveal character. Affleck's alternately somber and confrontational monologues are either too affected to be taken seriously or they're beautifully written and delivered but nevertheless not motivated enough to feel any more than contrived, just as much of the plot is.The Town opens by directly informing us that Charlestown breeds more bank robbers than anywhere else in the entire world. But rather than showing us real people, we're given crime drama stereotypes, in thrall to a mawkishly sentimental formula. Affleck is the leader of the heist crew with a heart and a burdened conscience who becomes romantically linked with an idealized female figure of innocence, played by Hall, whose personal life seems to only be comprised of volunteering to help children and do earnest day-to-day activities, all purely incidental in order to serve Affleck's character arc. She doesn't seem to have a life of her own at all. The crew's second banana is Renner's unhinged, trigger-happy urban barbarian with an insular sense of honor among criminals. The crew is comprised of two other neighborhood guys as well, but we're given nothing about them at all. We see them intermingle, we see the foursome masked while performing spectacular robberies, but nothing that ultimately happens to these other two matters. They work for Pete Postlethwaite, the emblematic neighborhood old-timer who keeps the subsequent generation's angry young men bound to the eponymous segregated populist environment to do his dirty work.But The Town is not a bad film. It may be hackneyed, schmaltzy and conventional, but as Ebert once intelligently observed, what makes a movie good is not what it's about but how it's about it. It's certainly not as gritty as its opening words oblige, nor is it exceptional as a crime drama unattached to those words about Charlestown, but don't we watch those gangster films from the 1930s and '40s with the same trite, ham-handed and forcibly conformist scripts, Cagney, Bogart and Robinson spouting the same artificially prosey lines, and enjoy them to the point of rapture? Nostalgia, right? Well that's just what Affleck is going for with The Town: An atmospherically nostalgic, sentimentally driven elegy to the narrow streets of Boston. And in that subjective milieu, it's a very absorbing, highly adventurous entertainment.Something else that observant movie buffs admire about silver-screen gangster classics, but regard less about more modern films with the same dramatic tackiness listed above, is the technical structure. As over-the-top and ham-handed as White Heat, High Sierra and the great original Scarface are, especially by modern standards, they're shot, edited and directed with more than a deft hand for tension and brutal in-the-moment action. So is Affleck's The Town. For the first half hour, it's edited with a particular, emotional and suspenseful edge that not many romantic Hollywood films are. Of the many impacts provided by the overtonal and associational cutting is its dropping of us, the audience, straight into the initial dilemma of the story. And as the film progresses, there is the occasional suggestive use of editing, not just manipulating the temporal length of the cuts or its rhythmic characteristics, but to elicit a reaction from the audience even more complex than from cutting simply based on the length of a shot or the literal connection from one situation to the next.The most spectacular entertainment to extract from the movie in terms of narrative are certainly the heists, their getaways and repercussions. The robbery sequences themselves pull few punches. I've often wondered what security guards, law enforcement, bank employees and the like think and feel when faced with films like Ocean's Eleven and The Italian Job. Are they especially detached from the exhilarating spectacle of a witty machination like that, or do they sometimes actually resent the sugar-coated treatment of the sort of experience they've either had or fear to have? The Town is one of those heist films that maintain both the rush of a good movie heist sequence and the ferocity of the armed robbery of an establishment.",7,0,2,21 October 2010
Closer," A Filmed Play, But Alas a Well-Filmed, Very Moving Play
","Closer could have been a perfect movie had it not been so faithful to the theatrical chemistry between characters in Patrick Marber's original play. The dialogue is very very clever, and despite its unrealistic airs, it works. But because of its rhythm and pace, which is powerful nonetheless, it still seems like a play. One should not see a movie and be reminded of watching a play, because suddenly the fact that it's a movie becomes meaningless. The oneness of an individual creative medium, no matter how much it may have in common with another, is very important to maintain, because it is nothing without its continuous substantiation and comprehension in the world, and the enjoyment of it is so extremely beautiful and impactful because it is full of inherited memories and influences of the creation and development of it.Despite this, Closer is a very moving story exploding with incredible acting from its petit cast, Mike Nichols again drawing out the very best from each of his actors. His main achievement in directing this film is his treatment of his actors, whose power and consumption in their roles are so unremittingly personal portrayals that the unmistakable theatricality hardly deters them at all, which is why it is not an indefensible flaw.Marber's characters are so deeply realized that they have the prevailing effect of truly real people, whose sexual experience has given them a collective conscious which affects the mature and wise emotional atmosphere of the movie, physicalized by the staggering current that connects these four people. Likewise, this film is a very emotional experience that moves you and makes life clearer for you, however much experience with sex and relationships you may have.",9,1,1,5 August 2008
Battleship Potemkin," This Film Is Now Obsolete.
","Sergei Eisenstein wrote Battleship Potemkin as a revolutionary propaganda film, but also used it to test his theories of 'montage'. The revolutionary Soviet filmmakers were trying out the result of film editing upon audiences, and Eisenstein endeavored to edit the film in such a way as to generate the utmost emotional reaction, so that the viewer would feel compassion for the defiant sailors and extreme dislike for their pitiless overlords. In the style of most propaganda, the characterization is clearcut and uncomplicated so that the audience could unmistakably tell with whom they should identify.In both the Soviet Union and abroad, the film stunned audiences not so much for its political message as for its violence, which was explicit by the standards of the age. The film's capability of having great bearing on political ideas by means of emotional reaction was observed by Joseph Goebbels, who said 'anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film.' This remarkable influence felt and feared by tremendously powerful and influential people is something that never happens in regard to cinema today and hasn't for at least half a century now. Do you know why? Because film is a seminal part of life now. It is a part of the media, and it is easy to overlook one movie in favor of another, or film entirely for another facet of the media, like television. When this picture emerged, it was pure, ripe, brand new, almost surreal to its spectators. Eisenstein's theory of montage has been diluted and adulterated by now to the point where it is either completely ignored or thought of as kindergarten. In 1925, who would have though that a moving picture could provoke such a reaction? Who would have thought it had the capability to change someone who watched it?Now, this film is obsolete. Film-making has advanced too far for this film to have any kind of effect on the contemporary viewer. The dialogue, as in the title cards, feel too painfully scripted, due to having no need to acknowledge during the writing how people, especially common sailors, speak. The title cards that don't represent dialogue are so self-explanatory that they make the images futile and redundant. 'Bowl of soup.' Oh, really? There are great closeups of canons, but aside from them, there is no composition, which had not been established as firmly as Eisenstein's montage theory. One shot juxtaposed with another doesn't necessarily say it all. One has to direct the forces withing a shot for a cut to serve any purpose.I have tried this picture twice. I have felt nothing. The movie's legendary moment is in the scene of the slaughter of civilians on the Odessa Steps, in which soldiers shoot a mother who is pushing a baby in a carriage, and it rolls down the steps in the midst of the escaping mass. This image has been imitated in Brazil, The Untouchables, The Godfather, Joshua and 28 Weeks Later to name a few. These are the only ones of which I can think that I myself have seen, and each one has a more exciting 'Odessa steps sequence' rendition than the original 'Odessa steps sequence.' There is nothing wrong or flat in Eisenstein's sequence. It is well shot and well edited, and why would so many great films imprint off of an unbearably boring film? Because to the generations to which their makers belong, it still had resonance, and it left an effect upon them. But can you watch Brazil or The Godfather and feel that Potemkin, in your own perspective regardless or history's, even compares?",7,16,25,7 October 2008
Taxi Driver," A Truly Mysterious Noir
","This truly mysterious film is not about a city but about the endurance of Travis' soul, and out of all New York he pegs only those details that sustain and bolster his fixations. He is an ex- Marine, Vietnam vet, composer of conscientious anniversary letters to his parents, taxi driver, killer. The movie seldom digresses terribly far off from the exclusive, deeply abstract manner in which he views the city and lets it traumatize him.It's a place, first of all, occupied by women he cannot have: unapproachable blonde women who might find him attractive for a second, who might join him for coffee, but who ultimately will have to shake their heads and sigh, 'Oh, Travis!' because they find him odd. And then, even more inhumanly, the city seems colonized by men who can have these women, men ranging from clowning political hacks to street-corner pimps who, all the same, have in common the mystical aptitude to address a woman without getting everything wrong.Travis Bickle is an old-fashioned romantic at heart, but he settles for the lowest common denominator of diversion when he can't sleep because of how small his sociopathic mind is. He follows no political issues, music, movies, not much except his job. He could on paper look for fares anywhere in the city, but he's invariably carried back to 42nd Street, to Times Square and the whores, street freaks, and porno houses. It's here that an ugly kind of sex comes closest to the external, the sex of buying, selling, and using people. Travis isn't into that, he hates it, but Times Square nurtures his rage. His sexual frustration is focalized into a loathing for the dregs he consumingly scrutinizes. He tries to violate the repetition. There is a masterfully melancholy scene so painful that camera pans away into a doorway. It's as if we can't stand to watch Travis feel the grief of being rejected. This is fascinating, because later, when Travis goes on a murder spree, the camera goes so far as to assume slow motion so we can see every nuance of the violence. That Scorsese finds the rejection more disturbing than the murders is compelling, because it helps to clarify Travis Bickle, and maybe it goes to some degree toward defining one variation of urban violence. Travis has been ostracized so methodically, so frequently, from a piece of the action that ultimately he has to hit back in some such way.Scorsese's distinctive noir doesn't disclose more than a decent fraction of what we want to know, even through the narration of Travis himself keeping a diary, because his diary is given in present-tense. We're not told where Travis comes from, what his particular issues are, because this isn't an investigation, but a vignette of some days in his life. We don't know the niceties of Travis's abstractions, but in an eerie sense we know what we need to know of him. The film's a masterpiece of evocative character study. Scorsese's techniques sorts out fine points that suggest feelings, and that's the result he wants. The performances are both strange and realistic: He goes for moments from his actors, rather than slowly developed characters. It's as if the required emotions were written in the margins of their scripts: Give me anger, fear, dread. Robert De Niro, as Travis Bickle, evokes despondency, agitation and passion while totally maintaining mystique, and in many of his close-ups, Scorsese employs slow motion virtually below the threshold of our consciousness to prolong the foreshadowing and manifestation. Cybill Shepherd, as the blonde beauty, is an iceberg languidly retreating into sympathy. And there's Jodie Foster, shockingly cast as a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis wants to 'save.' Harvey Keitel, a veteran of Scorsese's earliest work, is the pimp who manipulates her, and he evokes the sure brand of severity that's all subterfuge.These people are introduced essentially in very brief moments, like smoky shadows forebode to utterly eclipse them. This cinematic shard of steel, to which John Hinckley's subsequent actions were frankly a testament, is a hell, saturated in Bernard Herrmann's fluidly disillusioned score, from the opening shot of a cab emanating from dark, gloomy veils of apparent overcast to the climactic killing scene in which the camera ultimately looks straight down.",10,1,2,5 November 2006
Shutter Island," 'There's No Moral Order As Pure As This Storm.'
","Shutter Island begins encircling us with the first sinister notes even under Paramount's logo. Like the ensuing film, they're menacing. This is Martin Scorsese's haunted house movie, given the insatiable quivering apprehension we sense when thrillers don't defuse all the suspense with action sequences. He's a master of accompanying image with music. This is one of his very most effective endeavors in music placement. He seizes the piano and strings of a minor piece by Mahler for every drop of its sensory character, waxes Kubrick with Penderecki's dissonant clusters, finds parallels with John Cage's hypnotic incoherence, the steady tonal pulse of Ingram Marshall.Shutter is an obscure, jagged island off Boston, where a Civil War fort has been acclimated to a prison for the criminally insane. We close in by boat under descending skies with Marshals Teddy and Chuck, played by the strikingly symbiotic duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. They're to inspect the vanishing of a childkiller. There appears to be no way to escape the island alive. The evasion of one prisoner might not necessitate the involvement of Feds unacquainted with the circumstances, but we never question that element. Not after the foreboding enclosures of the prison appear, the investigators guided into the office of Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley with that ominous charisma he's gotten down cold in his career's latter half, continually deflecting all Gandhi-typecasting.Experiencing the novel before the film was my mistake. It took four theater viewings to completely separate the two. The film's more lavish, much less concise than the unfolding, and especially closing, of the book, but there are stunning additions by Laeta Kalogridis that flood the film with thematic alarm bells, making it resonate more deeply and pensively than even the revelatory rattling of the novel. Scorsese chisels through the real world inch after inch. It's plain that Teddy has no notion of what he's getting into. The premise seems elementary: The woman's missing, Teddy and Chuck will search. But the frigid concrete walls ensnare them. The offices of Cawley and staff, equipped for war commanders, look thinly modernized from silent Fritz Lang or Robert Wiede films. Flashbacks convey Teddy's torturous experiences since WWII, which provided classic noir's bleak percussion. Shellshock could be seen in men struggling to appear self-assured in their veneers of undistinguished outfits, heavy smoking, fedoras worn low. DiCaprio and Ruffalo both assume this appearance. While Ruffalo purposely seems more like a disposition than a character, DiCaprio fittingly makes it feel more like a buoyant front.DiCaprio commands some astonishing emotional scenes, modulating sharply between suspicion, aggression, bewilderment, agony. Had Paramount not postponed the release to a less Oscar-wary date, DiCaprio would doubtlessly be nominated. Indeed, the entire cast is outstanding in performances so unusual in substance. Many are figments, double-blinds, imposters, even mere functionaries. But all color Teddy's journey so dynamically. Michelle Williams effectively embodies a broken dream. Ted Levine inhabits an ominous duality as the Warden, who arguably may define the loonies-running-the-asylum cliché, but is he so loony? Maybe he's seeing more clearly than everyone else. Patricia Clarkson looks so unlike herself, possibly because her scene seems so convincing, yet so off-kilter. Emily Mortimer and Jeffrey Dean Morgan could be all Teddy's looking for, yet both baffle and intimidate him, and us.There's a flashback merged with a dream that may be the closest Scorsese has ever brought me to tears. He uses Max Richter's tender strings, loss literally raining all around Teddy and the wife that'll only be real, in his arms, for another few moments. Scorsese's never done a scene remotely as surreal, or romantic, before. It's astounding seeing him extend his breadth into untapped territory. Indeed the film's foremost impact is on one's senses. It's a premonition of disquieting enigmas: How did this woman escape from a locked cell in a sealed ward, its panels able to endure cannons? Why do Cawley and the dubious Dr. Naering, played by 81-year-old Max Von Sydow---who I'd still dare not mess with---feel like they're lying? Why do the prison's practices spark Teddy's flashbacks to freeing Dachau? These sorts of wringers are at film noir's core. Characters never enter a noir without some major burden. They have unresolved dilemmas, submerged anguish. Nevertheless, why are the others so odd? Kingsley tastefully bleeds intimidation whenever he smiles, then mixes his signals with kindly etiquette so gracefully that he might as well be wiping off the menace with a silk handkerchief. Not to mention two supporting actors, most memorably psychopaths in Zodiac and The Silence of the Lambs, here play lawmen.There's electrifying imagery in Shutter Island. There's a lighthouse, a cave on a cliff, dizzying falls to waves pounding on rocks below. A storm draws nigh. Light drips through clouds. The wind seems sorrowful. That's what the movie is: Ambiance, foreshadowing, the deterioration of Teddy's self-assurance, even selfhood. Scorsese induces pure dread, in various keys. Sculpting Robert Richardson's grandiose, angular, intensely colorful cinematography is Thelma Schoonmaker's trademark use of manipulated speeds, freeze-frames, those dang flashbulbs, as well as the ever more discriminating and poetic use of the cut from one shot to another that we always find in Scorsese's work.Some either think the ending doesn't hold water or the movie building towards it doesn't. What would be more gratifying? Compared to other films with similar twists, Shutter Island is much more understated, without the urge to repeat earlier moments for redundant effect during the revelation, which instead is played gradually, dawning on us. This is all of a story, even the pieces that don't seem to click. One's inclination is to distinguish what goes before, and make rational deductions. However, what if you can't peg precisely what went before? What if there were concealed things about various characters? What if the movie's perspective isn't objective but splintered? Where can it all go? We wonder. So does Teddy.",9,2,5,2 June 2010
Ocean's Thirteen," I Hate Nines
","I frankly think that audiences walk in with the exact opposite attitude towards the Ocean's films than the one I walk in with. Those who don't like them seem to come out with such a tainted look at everything, like even the best parts of the film are actually flaws. The people who like them seem to come out thinking that they've just seen a cute little romp devised as nothing more than a cash register by and for the millionaires starring in and making it. These people aren't wrong, but there is definitely a difference between Hollywood gloss with the mushy brain of an adolescent pyromaniac and that with the imagination of truly talented screenwriters.Ocean's Thirteen, like the first two, is my kind of film, a slick, elaborate caper with hues of revenge and a dryly ditzy sense of humor. If this is your kind of film too, then sit back, and just be mutable with the problematic inconsistencies, my friend. The heist is a summation of the furthest expansion of David Levien and Brian Koppelman's wildest ideas, all contrived to integrate in a very fun and witty way. If you're complaining halfway through about the excessive and perhaps wanton use of laborious gadgets of either complete fantasy or costing of more money and time than would be practically involved in whatever robbery, then you should've watched the first two soon before seeing this one to get yourself geared up again. People perhaps don't pay close enough attention to the small details of dialogue and story inferences in the Ocean films, because truly every ridiculous point has an explanation decent enough to be bought somewhere in there. There's one point where the gadget aspect of Danny Ocean's plan, which if mapped out would take a trigonometric genius, where I could've drawn the line. I won't explain the instance for fear of giving anything away, so all I will say is that if you're going to seduce someone, seduce them. There is no easy chemical or technological way out of the hard part of it, but there's a small bit of dialogue that's very comfortably and gracefully in character that permits this little excuse for the writers not to elaborate a clever seduction scene.But if there's any real peeve, anyone should have, it's what I'm about to mention, yet nobody ever says a word about it: First, they needed eleven people, but we bought it because Danny and Rusty thought long and hard about how many people they would need to pull off a virtually impossible heist on a Las Vegas casino vault, which had never before been successfully robbed. In Ocean's Twelve, we bought it because everybody owed Andy Garcia their own share of the debt, and the plot gives way to a sensible reason why there would be a need for a twelfth parcel at the last minute. Now, if you are a master thief that has proved himself to be such, why do you need thirteen people to rob a casino? You're a master! You don't need that many! I do understand the necessity of maintaining the regular appearances of the stars we expect, but then why not involve Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones in this one at all?The cast of course is a joy to see, and they all reprise their roles with the careful amount of familiarity. The heel-clickingly pleasing casting choice of Al Pacino is of course a satisfaction to the commercial portions of our movie-going mentalities, and of course we all know who he plays. I personally found Ellen Barkin to be underused and in need of further screen time. She's still very hot and still a very engrossing actress. To see the same on-screen pairing of her with Pacino as we did 18 years ago in Sea of Love is quite an interesting and unexpected element of the film, especially when in Sea of Love they played passionate people, tugging violently at each other's emotions. Here, they stand next to each other, rarely exchange words, and almost never look each other in the eye.Soderbergh, who has brought a very fresh and inventive touch of heavy style to the series, creates yet another advanced version of the world of colors, shades, editing, and gloss of Ocean's Eleven. Here, we're accosted by pinks and purples, and otherwise every color in the film is filled in like a lush painting or a Technicolor film by Powell and Pressburger, and title cards are given special backgrounds breaking from the action of the film, behind 1970s-style, almost African-style font. Having always been one of my favorite directors, he stays fresh and clever. Perhaps one minute, you'll think, this movie doesn't have the emotion or scope of a finale, but then you realize that all the characters and environments are those of a cold, earthy gloss. No tempestuous chemistry exists between anyone or anything, and that is part of the universe these films create. Ocean's Thirteen does everything a good, fun heist movie does.",8,1,4,18 June 2007
Barry Lyndon," The Pomposity of Greatness
","Some people find Barry Lyndon a unique, as a result of being remote, effort in a sort of transcendental film-making. Others find it a pretentious flat tire. I shake my head at the latter view. How can anyone be bored by such a daringly resolute film, unless they've become such sleepy filmgoers that no movie can make an imprint on them unless it complies to their expectations? Stanley Kubrick's three-hour adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque tale, which succeeds transcendently as a film which experimented with film stock, lenses and natural lighting, may not be a great entertainment in the traditional sense, but it's a reckless augmentation of directorial clarity: Kubrick saying he's going to make this text work as a model of the way he sees the world. The chamber music saturating the soundtrack is so delicate and sophisticated yet so primitive, as is the setting and time.This four-time Oscar-winning period film is substantially hostile in its deliberate coldness. Many of its turns take place offscreen, the cleverly opinionated narrator tending to tell us what's about to happen and we learn long before the film ends that its hero will die broke and unfruitful. This disclosure doesn't much dishearten us, because Kubrick has directed Ryan O'Neal in the title role as if he were an oil painting. He would be a dauntless man of power were he not seeing tunnel vision.And the film has the pomposity of greatness. Aside from how much it cost, how many years it was in the making, not being the commercial success Warner Bros. had been hoping for. How many directors would have Stanley Kubrick's self-assurance in taking this body of history and drama, this basically small yarn of a young man's rise and fall, and completing it in an approach that ultimately bids our approach to it? We not only see Kubrick's movie, we see it in the mindset on which he demands.His title character is a young man to whom things occur. Barry appears to take hardly any knowing charge over his life. He falls into a short-sighted adolescent love, quickly has to leave the community after a duel, enrolls just about inattentively in the British Army, fights in Europe, defects from not one but both sides, falls in with significant and shady compadres, marries a woman of affluence and charm and then devastates his own world because he misses the morale to endure in it. And all of these things feel capricious. Young Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's son by Sir Charles, despises Barry from the start. The marriage is not a happy one, yet they celebrate a new son. Barry enjoys himself and philanders whilst keeping Lady Lyndon in apathetic isolation.The key is that the Baroness's son is another Redmond Barry. We're reminded of the righteous renegade young Barry. And we see through the depictions of the world around him that conquering was the inclination to acquire love. He was conquered as a young Irishman, as the rejected third of a love triangle, thus his likewise response was to conquer one's rivals, which heightens the intensity of the Baroness's pain and desperation when she is subjugated by him after being of such dominant distinction. In the end, who's conquered who?",10,6,11,19 April 2009
Full Metal Jacket," More a Showcase of Kubrick's Powerful Instincts Than a Dramatic Narrative of the War
","Standing alone, Full Metal Jacket is yet another showcase of Stanley Kubrick's powerful instincts with gritty compositions, drawing out disturbing qualities in his actors and creating an atmosphere in which each of your senses are not so much drawn in as intensely experienced when applied to it. As one among the group of films in the 1970s and '80s about the Vietnam War, it is about the subject matter, yet the subject is not even close to being as deeply felt by the filmmaker. Oliver Stone brought his own front-line experiences to Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and even Heaven and Earth, all of which engage an audience in emotional hurricanes. Francis Ford Coppola achieved the nightmarish effect of war in Apocalypse Now because he subjected himself to such hurricanes in his own nightmarish experience of making the film; he made ruthless, often amoral decisions which largely impacted many of that movie's most affecting images. It's a great film that does not want you to like it. Full Metal Jacket suffers at the hand of what makes most of Kubrick's work great, which is his reasonable detachment from, his automatic response to the material.Full Metal Jacket has by many young men been memorialized as a favorite, on account of its vividly foremost performances by R. Lee Ermey, as the drill commander who barks more catchy one-liners than one would imagine truly incites fear, and Vincent D'Onofrio, who with serene innocence reacts understandably to such laughable quips, which makes him a target from day one, a benign, overweight airhead whose metamorphosis is a masterpiece of horror.There are many scenes in the latter half of this chillingly dry film that seem more theatrical than cinematic, or documentary-like. The first act, easily the most popular among the movie's myriad fans, is promising because it intimately follows a select few faces in a ruthlessly strict boot camp. We are seeing an aspect not much before seen, to markedly memorable, not to mention extensively quotable, effect. What comes later, in the combat zones leading toward and during the 1967 Tet Offensive, sees the boot camp segment as a tough first act to follow. Scenes of the focal platoon's reflections on their casualties, sadly ignorant views on the war, lounging banter, are at times robotically scripted, stiffly physicalized.The movie's final arrangement, in which our platoon is trapped in a desolate zone with an unseen sniper, is brilliant, however. They are projecting every American fear generated by the upending preoccupation with not knowing what against which they must defend themselves. When they finally discover the shooter, point blank, the augmentation and diminishment of the characters who've made it thus far depend on whether or not they realize how little they truly did know before that moment. Even the central character, if one could call him that, does not seem to know just how many volumes it speaks.",10,0,1,9 June 2009
Empire of the Sun," A Great Film
","Empire of the Sun is just as wonderful of an example of the ethereal, soul-grabbing magic Spielberg creates as any. It's an aggressively arresting epic that develops heavily and suddenly takes a turn with a harsh whirlwind of a dramatic tempest.In his very first role at the age of twelve, Christian Bale racks the audience like a barrage of machine gun bullets, delivering sensationally in maybe the most demanding, evolving, and extensive role for a child I've ever seen in a movie. John Malkovich, as he always has, steals every scene he is in, playing the coldest but most generally charming supporting character. Among other highlights of the cast are early performances from Miranda Richardson, playing a very sorrowful Englishwoman who augments as much as she can before the chance of diminishment heightens, Nigel Havers, playing a doctor who amidst all the pressure that keeps him on edge manages to keep Bale's rampagingly passionate youngster down to earth, Joe Pantoliano, even this early in his career playing life's punching bag in the form of a nagging sidekick, and Ben Stiller, the film's biggest surprise, in a bit part among many other no-names in the group of American boys at Malkovich's feet.Empire of the Sun tells a dynamic, lavish, and heartfelt story of a young English boy, adventurous and wide-eyed as can be, obsessively fascinated by airplanes, belonging to a rich family in Shanghai during WWII who is hit like a ton of bricks by the Japanese occupation. The most impressive thing about the film is its portrayal of this young boy's alien perspective of all that suddenly happens and his furiously fast learning of his situation, adapting to all that devastates his life.Those who feel that slight twinge of bias against Steven Spielberg for his mind-blowing and never-ending box office success, you are really missing out on the brilliant work of one of those filmmakers who is truly a master at what a movie, like a novel, is supposed to do, which is suck you into every sensory element of the world of its characters.",10,5,11,31 December 2006
Corpse Bride," An Atmospheric Parody of Tim Burton's Most Detailed Perceptions of People and Things
","Tim Burton's films are cultivated by the same halfway goth preteens that melt over Johnny Depp, and the feeling of the multiplex theater crowded with them on a late Friday or Saturday night with your own dynamic yet passive group of friends is felt through Corpse Bride even while one sits at home and watches it on a DVD rented from the public library. If Burton has fallen off in recent years with Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you must admit that there is still an atmosphere such as the one above mentioned in his more recent and continuing films. Whatever he does to carve and style his work for each generation's wave of odd but commercially compelling target audience is a great talent for subtlety.While it isn't something very special that will stay with me much later, Corpse Bride is a film of Burton's I've truly liked after awhile not having made movies on the same wavelength as Ed Wood, which I adore. In Corpse Bride, the virtuously atmospheric clay animation is the outcome of Burton's very specific, meticulous, and imaginatively analytical ideas and artistic demands. The animation is able to depict parodies of his most detailed perceptions of people and things, and the clay element gives the film a very Gothic look which is his trademark. I was also surprised by the wonderful impact of the emotional finale.",7,1,2,10 September 2007
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The Overwhelming Power of the Human Face
","You will not appreciate the experience of silent film until you know the face of Renee Maria Falconetti. In a medium without words, where the filmmakers conceived that the camera seized the heart of characters through their faces, to see Falconetti in Dreyer's landmark is to look into electric, almost extrasensory eyes that will never relinquish you. She also embodies Joan with an unrelenting monastic guilelessness, moving as if in a dream, her body language so slow and meditative. She answers questions in taut earnest.Dreyer had been given a large budget and a screenplay by his French producers, but he sacked the screenplay and turned in lieu to the archives of Joan's trial. They told the account that has become folklore: of how a rustic provincial girl, dressed as a boy, led the French troops in their triumph over the British occupation forces. How she was captured by French loyal to the British and brought before a church court, where her conviction that she had been emboldened by celestial apparitions led to accusations of blasphemy. There were many cross-examinations, supplemented by torment, before Joan was burned at the stake. Dreyer coalesces them into one trial, in which the judges, their faces wrenched with their alarm at her dauntlessness, hover over her with roars and charges. Men here who think they represent God are the cruelest to her. She remains undeterred. Believing her would compromise their beliefs. So she is punished for the same thing that drives them to punish her: Faith.There is not one single establishing shot in all of Dreyer's passion play, which is filmed with eccentric, idealistic mystery by Rudolph Mate completely in closeups and medium shots, creating apprehensive proximity between Joan and her oppressors. Nor are there freely interpreted perceptible connections between shots. What does this signify to us? There is a lexicon of shooting and editing that we subliminally presume at the movies. We figure that if two people are talking, the cuts will make it appear that they are facing one another. We expect that if a judge is challenging a defendant, the camera position and editing will make it evident where they stand regarding each other. If we see three people in a room, we presume to be able to say how they are situated and which is nearest to the camera. Almost all such visual expectations are absent from this film, replaced by an all-encompassing disjointed effect.Alternatively, the placement of cuts shapes the film into a sequence of surprising panchromatic imagery. The prison guards and the ecclesiastics on the court are seen in high contrast, frequently from a low angle, and although there are frequently knifelike structural shapes behind them, we are not certain precisely what the distance is. There is a shot of three priests, likely positioned from front to back, but shot in such a way that their heads appear piled on top of each other. All of the faces of the inquisitors are shot in bright light, without makeup, so that the clefts and blemishes of their skin appear to evince an ailing internal life.Falconetti, in comparison, is shot in more delicate grays, instead of blacks and whites. Also without makeup, she appears austere and absorbed by internal certainty. Solitude proves her only on-screen companion in the whole film. Note an exchange where a judge asks her whether St. Michael indeed spoke to her. Her serene face looks to propose that whatever happened between Michael and herself was so far outside the compass of the question that no answer is possible.Why did Dreyer splinter his space, obscure the visual impression and shoot in closeup? He might've wanted to eschew the refined snares of a historical drama. There is no landscape here, save walls and arches. Nothing was put in to look pleasing. You do not leave talking about costumes, granted they are all real. The preeminence of the faces asserts that these very people did what they did. Dreyer dismantles the church court of its ceremony and respectability and reveals its members as obese charlatans in the pay of the British. Their fixed eyes and mercenary mouths violate Joan's asceticism.To us contemporary audiences, accustomed to films where emotion is reflected by dialogue and action more than by faces, a film like this 1928 sequence of expressions is a disconcerting undertaking, so penetrating we worry we will unearth more occult than we wish, although watching with the Visions of Light soundtrack makes a hugely profound difference. It is deeply moving music, and also allows a less demanding experience from a modern audience. It is a testament to the film's power that it also features a performance by Antonin Artaud, who wrote of a need for a 'Theatre of Cruelty,' by which he meant a fierce, physical grit to eradicate false reality. He believed that text had been a bully over subject and implication, and wanted in its place a theatre comprised of a unique language halfway between concept and action. Our compassion is provoked so vigorously for Joan that Dreyer's visual methods don't even play like aesthetic decisions, but like the remnants of Joan's experience. Depleted, emaciated, frozen, in perpetual despair, merely 19 when she died, she lives in a chimera where the faces of her tyrants surge like savage nightmares.",10,2,4,15 October 2009
Gone Baby Gone," A Venerating Directorial Debut About How Some People Should Not Be Parents
","The first thing any viewer will notice about Gone Baby Gone is that it does for Boston what Deliverance did for the Cahulawassee River. The streets are filled with some of the most sickeningly ugly, obese, wiry, and disfigured people you've ever seen. And, as one indescribably feels every here and there during the film, it seems unnecessary or uneven. Nevertheless, it is really Ben Affleck's undercurrent of shock that he forces us to face about Dennis Lehane's reflection of the relentless nastiness of human beings. This film is a vengeful testament to superficiality and wrongness of all claims against Ben Affleck on the basis that he is a boyishly attractive movie star and other gross underestimations of 'pretty boys' in Hollywood like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Ben Affleck, yes, handsome Hollywood hunk, directs a film that, instead of flaunting style, grits with a hard-edged rusty- kitchen-sink realism.His younger brother Casey Affleck, an endearing character actor, gets his break as the lead here, in a down-to-earth, street-smarts role as a private detective who is used to handling vicious, shady people in grimy, scuzzy areas of Southie, but even having grown up around it can't prepare him for what he will have to witness and decide. Coarsely sexy Michelle Monaghan, who was hilariously callous in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, plays his detective wife, a motherly sort whose compassion she knows may blend dangerously with her work. The most powerful performance in the film, however, is delivered by the barrel of volatile explosives that is Ed Harris, who I don't ordinarily find as appealing as I did here, enlivening his capability of being intimidating and silently warning you of an ominous, lurking, terrifying side of him. He delivers a beautifully down-home monologue at one point about the innocence and rudimentary forgiveness of children. He chokes up, but shoves the tears back with anger. (His partner is played by John Ashton, who it's good to see again. Where's he been since the Beverly Hills Cop films?)The film's uncompromising brooding with its dark, extremely depressing subject of child abduction pays off with certain poignant moments, possibly showing wisdom in both Lehane's writing and Affleck's rendering of its effects, as the movie shows us the importance of the effacement, recognition, and understanding of even the most painful experiences because they are what make the great ones great, as are reflected in the most disturbing images of the film and the most relieving ones. The story's culmination to its ultimate dilemma is such an uncompromising example of facing the world, in which black and white is a myth and grey is virtually always the reality. And no matter what the resolution comes to be, it may not boil down to black and white even still.",9,0,0,16 February 2008
American Hustle," Talk About Being Conned, Everybody! Come on!
","The opening scene of Irving Rosenfeld, arguably Christian Bale's furthest left-field role so far, refining his comb-over and crowning it with a spray of aerosol heralds the start of something great. Alas, it was all drivel thereafter.David O. Russell's raid on grifters and graft in the late 1970s is full of smug put-ons. Though he has selected a cast entirely comprised of hype-magnet zeitgeist stars to draw the crowds, it only exacerbates the self-seriousness of the script, which is pandemic with high camp and laughable pageantry. These people talk way too much. About nothing. Just for Russell's pride in his own riffing. Beginning with the title card, 'Some of this actually happened,' the film unceasingly reminds us---often through various characters in carelessly derivative voice-over---that life is a con game, and we all lie. We lie to others, we lie to ourselves. And that it's the American way. And American Hustle isn't clever about making this point. It makes it, makes it again, and in case you didn't get it the first few times, a character says it out loud. Then another one does. And before you know it, you find that it's the self-congratulatory Russell and his overrated cast, not to mention the hordes of critics raving about it, that are conning themselves.Like Russell's other films, there is quite a bit of humor, but in this case, not all of it is intended. One scene has Jennifer Lawrence going on and on about her nail polish over an important dinner with Irving and Jeremy Renner playing an Italian-American mayor. What initially is marginally charming descends rapidly into a maddening sequence, much too long and breathtakingly vain. And symbolic of the movie in its entirety.The dialogue is so labored, so artificial and pretentious that everyone involved must've felt too highly of themselves to probe as deeply or use thinking as critical as they all have in past work. Certain scenes seem either pedantically constrained, just have no purpose, or both. Take for instance a particularly eyeroll-inducing ladies room showdown between Adams and Lawrence, while numerous lines are groaners. 'After Vietnam and Watergate, we're just starting to trust politicians again.' Seriously? 'I just want to be loved!!!' What is this, Clifford Odets? 'My dream was to be anyone but myself.' Thanks for telling me, you self-mythologizing drama queen.Meanwhile, when you didn't think the GoodFellas and Casino procurements were transparent enough, there's De Niro in a fleeting cameo as a vicious mobster which has no more effect than that of a gimmick of a declining legend riffing on his career staple.Even the essentially perfect casting of comic genius Louis C.K., in just the kind of bit role I could really get used to seeing him play, can't relieve the film of its hollow ego trip. Once you've unraveled the movie's trendy gloss-over, you've got an overblown wannabe of an undertaking, stuffed with nothing more than the bluster of hand-me-down inspiration, gaudy artifice and lugubrious schtick.",5,4,10,4 January 2014
Top Secret!," Ah, I Don't Care Anymore. It's Just Hilarious, So Watch It.
","Here's a movie so abjectly campy and poorly made that enjoying it is like watching a performance while someone next to you obnoxiously chews gum the whole time. It is so obviously shot on studio sets. Actors are so obviously wearing make up. During the hilarious German magic salesman bit, whatever the German sprays in the spy's face makes the spy's make-up smear more and more. I can't quite figure out if Val Kilmer is just all-around wooden or if the Zuckers just don't tend to use his better takes. The musical sequences are truly boring, except for the rug sequence which is pretty cool. What it ends up boiling down to is an unending stream of puns and coarse visual gags one must wade through hopeless production values to take pleasure in.Regardless, if one can, there is one sequence that's such a unique example of expressly cinematic humor that I'm surprised to find it here rather than an early Woody Allen comedy. The hero visits a Swedish bookshop. The scene relies not on why, but on English played in reverse, which sounds Scandinavian. The entire scene does this, with English subtitles. This is funny enough at the outset, before we even get it, but it becomes exceptional at the end of the scene, when it finally gives itself away. This is a level of filmic wit so far beyond comparison the surrounding movie that it's almost a contradiction splattered in the middle of it.Nevertheless, like a Mel Brooks film, this movie will readily go for a laugh wherever one is even distantly liable to be found. It has political jokes and boob jokes, dog poop gags, and ballet jokes. It teases two utterly divergent Hollywood genres: the spy thriller and the Elvis Presley musical. It concerns an expatriate who escaped America by balloon during the Carter administration, an associate of the French underground named Escargot, and Omar Sharif contained in a flattened automobile.Unlike Airplane!, which devoted itself to sending up one, very easily identifiable kind of popular film and which was performed by a large cast of recognizables whose careers were secured by such films, Top Secret! is based on no directly familiar forebear. It's by and large a lampoon of East-West espionage movies, as they might have been fashioned to go with a star like Elvis Presley or Frankie Avalon, something that no East-West espionage film ever remotely came close to doing. But now that I think about a lot of the shameless WWII propaganda using A-list dramatic talent, why not go all the way and put Paul Anka and Fabian on the frontlines with the dirty Japs and crouts? The foreseeably threadbare story in Top Secret! has something to do with an East German plot to bring Germany back together, ostensibly by containing the United States fleet just inside the Strait of Gibraltar. There's also something about a secret weapon and, more important, a huge cultural festival in East Germany designed to distract the attention of the Western powers from events in the Mediterranean. This really is a funny idea, too. I mean, can you imagine the Joint Chiefs being so concerned with whether or not Leonard Bernstein shows at a cultural festival that they would neglect to look at their daily intelligence reports?",7,1,3,26 October 2010
The Godfather: Part II," 'Michael, I Never Wanted This For You.'
","Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, 'You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago.' What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, 'It had nothing to do with business.' The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once.",9,20,25,22 February 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Adventures of Government Agencies That Go Unchecked
","In 2007, one expects nearly every big-budget American film to be less than impressive. I saw The Bourne Ultimatum and was thrilled the way action movies don't always thrill anymore. It thrilled me because there is definite mind paid to the film-making and screen writing. The action sequences are not a commotion of loudness, fast cutting, and violent movement. They are masterpieces of that good old friend suspense and inimitable tension. Take the sequence at Waterloo Station for instance. In a crowded place, there is Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon with a riveting assertion of each of the major elements of his character from his lack of memory mixing with vengeful aggression towards those responsible to the rigid and infinite training he must've completed in order to be realistically near superhuman. In this place compressed with endless streams of people, he must perfectly guide a person by phone so as to evade top-notch surveillance by the CIA's leading forces while beating up or killing guys following that person, all without drawing the attention of the overwhelming crowd in the terminal. That's a suspense sequence. Sir Alfred Hitchcock is turning to his side and fluffing his pillow in mid-dream in his grave.There is a fight scene in this film between Bourne and a rotten-to-the-core assassin in a crumbly apartment that is so intense that one feels as if they are involved in the fight first hand. That is what the ideal fight sequence is supposed to do. You are supposed to love the good guy, boiling with anger at each hit he suffers, and absolutely relish every hit suffered by the bad guy. Shot in such a way that sustains a rhythm of speedboat rate, and also one of those rare action sequences where dramatic acting comes into play even amidst the ultrajittery camera-work and editing, create this beautiful effect that other action films, especially the shallow ones that only serve as cash registers, wish they had.A peeve of mine, while we're on the subject of flimsy Hollywood blow-em-ups that serve as one of the many reasons why the rest of the world laughs at us, is the constant use in many of those films of musical score that is orchestral yet lathered in techno beats and sounds. I really cannot stand that kind of score. The Bourne Ultimatum is one Hollywood action film that does what I never thought one would do again, which is underscore with great orchestral music. Making film score fast and suspenseful can be done with an orchestra, you know. In fact, I don't think technologically synthesized music is very engaging at all. The Bourne Ultimatum knows this. Just thought I'd add that.Director Paul Greengrass uses cinematography throughout the film that, though it is glaringly dizzying still has a subliminal effect on the audience, leaking a paranoid, nervous feeling into each scene, and we thus know, by the excessive conspicuousness of it, that we are being manipulated, putting us in Bourne's position, fueling us with a riveted clenching of our hands to the arms of our seats, bruising the forearms of our dates and mothers. Not to mention that the scenes in New York City are some of the very very best I've seen in any recent film. Winter in New York, giving the climax of the film such unexpectedly affecting urban twilight atmosphere.The tight, very professionally structured script is engaging in its use of the mysterious operation Black Briar, a truly effective title for a truly evil-sounding operation, the contents of which I cannot disclose without spoiling anything, contents that are pretty topical around the edges right now for America. Let's keep making movies like this with indirect affronts to unconstitutional goings-on, giving the characters involved the same wryly indiscriminate portrayal as David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney do here.This was a pleasant surprise. Save for the silly, very needless and obvious final shot, this is a genuine showcase of the stuff real action adventure thrillers are made of.",8,1,3,2 September 2007
Fargo," Heck Ya Mean?!
","Fargo opens with the message that it is 'based on a true story,' and closes with a retraction that its 'persons and events' are fictional. 'True story' is a joshing dramatic contraption, obliquely causing us to accept certain elements we might not normally accept so easily. Regardless, Fargo is concordant with the intonations and distinctions of modern small-town life. When Chief Marge Gunderson stands at the first crime scene and counts three dead bodies, she accurately recognizes that the culprits are not from Brainerd. Endeavoring into the city on her inquest, she asks a friend for a tip on a good place to eat, and is guided to the Radisson buffet. Jerry Lundegaard is as boxed in by his sales manager's job and his cruel father-in-law as any inmate in a jail cell. He's shuffling a stolen car and a double fraud. His son hurtles off from the dinner table to meet his friends at McDonald's. His wife toils manically at every domestic chore, chopping, stirring and knitting with as much rapidity as she's capable of. Against these homegrown nuances, the crimes protrude as brutal and barbaric. There are unpleasant parts. Everyone recalls the scene with the wood-chipper. More cold-blooded is the scene where the poor hostage, blindfolded and barefoot, attempts to escape on foot in the snow, and Carl Showalter makes fun of her. There are also the shootings, callous and abrupt. Against this Chief Marge, seven months pregnant, applies cozy small-town buoyancy as a way of ferreting privileged info out of crooks.Our introduction to Marge comes far into this atmospheric and genre-less film. The crime aspects are at this point engaged. We've met Jerry, the auto sales executive with a ridiculous scheme. We've met Carl and his laconic, merciless accomplice, both memorably played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, who have settled for it. These are eccentric, off-kilter, incomparable characters, yet when things lose control and Marge and her husband Norm are presented is when the movie unearths its heart. Marge Gunderson is one of a sprinkling of characters whose names always abide in our recollections, like Travis Bickle, HAL 9000, Walter White. They are totally, daringly themselves in stories that rely upon exactly who they are. Lacking all the fetishistic glamour of other Hollywood policewomen, Marge is the chief in Brainerd, Minn., continues to have periods of morning sickness, inhales all the processed, frozen, prepackaged, canned food she can get her hands on, speaks in a Minnesota dialect where 'yeah,' pronounced 'ya,' is showered like a motto. She's a born cop, really sharp. Although one might find the lack of response by the State Police to the murder of one of their own highly questionable, at the crime scene local police chief Marge nevertheless promptly and efficiently deduces what occurred, and discerns there were two killers, one big, one small. Her partner, not so nimble, doesn't catch on that 'DLR' signifies a dealer plate: 'I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work there, Lou.' There is a scene some people seem to think baffling between Marge's first and second interviews with Jerry, when she has dinner with a high school classmate Mike Yanagita. It's a disquieting hiatus that, when it comes to motif---a forlorn guy lying hysterically, failing to mask his anxiety---weighs in as pivotal. Mike functions as an echo of Jerry, and the dinner scene works like the connector between Marge's first and second interviews with him. The next morning, she is about to revisit Brainerd when a high school girlfriend tells her that everything Mike said was a lie. That's the alarm bell that compels her back to Jerry, and is somehow superior to the recourse, a single interview with Jerry that just swelters him out.William H. Macy's performance is a cave-in of dread and agitation. Here is a man who just wants one thing: a $750,000 loan from his affluent father-in-law, so he can purchase parking lots and make some of his own money. His office's vertical blinds are used visually like prison bars. If he can steal the money, he can buy the lots. Yes, his wife will have to be abducted, but he'll have to be big about that. He knows nothing about the kidnappers, and lawyers are hounding him all day for data that would reveal the missing car. And there's Marge, sitting across his desk, bright and sprightly, asking him questions he cannot answer. Macy wilts, his smirking grin a cringe, his restraint like a nerve clasp, and things cram him further in.The snow and cold endow the Coens with cinematic reference marks and an inescapable feeling of location. The opening shot fades in to Jerry's desolate venture to transfer the car with a haunting folksy Carter Burwell score. High-angle shots reveal two frosted parking lots, which the Buscemi character curiously decides to boost license plates and make a ransom exchange. When Jerry struggles to satisfy a discontented client, the goofy man and his wife have their goose-down coats amusingly heaped in their laps. The frost and gloom oppress everything, and in the middle, in their snug envelope, are Chief Marge and Norm. The Coens have been said to gibe their characters, but their affinity for Marge generates the healing power of Fargo. Marge is the spark plug, alleviating grief and mending law and order. As a result, this might be the warmest film the brothers have so far made, and no less exceedingly ripe and uniquely engrossing than their other works.",10,0,1,30 May 2010
Burn After Reading," Joel and Ethan Coen's Arm's-Length Scoff at the Modern Age
","'I would tell students to make their characters want something, even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn't get it out all day. I thought that was wonderful.'  Kurt VonnegutThis comedy, Joel and Ethan Coen's arm's-length scoff at the modern age, never started from ideas but from character. And what interesting characters they are, all embodied sharply by a dream team cast of some of the most wonderfully enjoyable actors and actresses working today. We have never seen Brad Pitt or George Clooney play such inane and idiotic characters, and they are in top form. Pitt just got finished giving a chillingly real and bafflingly evil performance as Jesse James. Now he is playing a happy-go-lucky fitness trainer with nothing but air inside his head and a pompadour on top of it. Clooney, who even in his least emblematic performances as the title character in Michael Clayton and Bob Barnes in Syriana, has always played cool, level-headed earthy 1960s throwbacks, here plays a jittery, quick-tongued swinger with a double life. As such, not only do we feel as if Clooney is making fun of himself but he does as well, and accordingly his character's paranoia and overreactions are squared and cubed.I have not laughed as loud and as extensively in a long long time as I have at John Malkovich, a poised and sophisticated veteran CIA analyst brimming with frustration and stress, thus a drinking problem, whose therapeutic endeavor to write a memoir is sabotaged by a bunch of complete idiots. His enraged reactions and bloodshot peeks through the cracks of his elegance are some of the funniest comic acting in the world. He reinvents the phrase 'F***ing morons!!!!'What you know of the plot from trailers and TV spots is enough. It is not a film that relies on plot. The plot hinges desperately upon the inanity of the unabashedly modern characters that screw it up to the point where the film itself basically resolves with two sideline characters, one of them a government man played with the trademark dry and straight-faced insensitivity of J.K. Simmons, implying that there really hasn't been much point to any of this. 'What did we learn? Not to do it again. I don't know what we did, but...'The absurdity of its characters, with the exception of Malkovich's CIA rogue Osbourne Cox and his shady wife, played with Tilda Swinton signature brand of pompous feminine callousness, is silly in every way. Their reasons for doing the things that they do are regarded by them with such ardor and desperation, which causes you to find yourself laughing even when there is no verbal or visual punchline. And what makes this comedy what it is is that there is no real farcical contrivance. It is a farce sparked by the decisions of these goofy dimwits, the most determined and driven of whom is Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke, who has the same go-getter willpower of most of her characters. How does she always seem faultlessly cast in everything she does?What is most admirable about this work by the Coen brothers, still spinning with the oomph from their inordinately brilliant landmark comeback No Country For Old Men, is that they initially intended to sit down and write a spy movie, because, what the hell, they had never done one before. But they came up with this, the only espionage-related traces of which are in the mere occupations of very few of its characters and the incidental effects of the rest of the characters on two CIA superiors and the very confused Russian Embassy. Joel and Ethan were fine letting the ideas come and the juices flow and letting the script go where it wanted to go. If they had worked through any doubts with what it was turning into and restricted it to the bounds of a spy movie, it would not have been nearly as good and we would never have been granted this skillfully pointless portrait of, as CIA analyst Osbourne Cox puts it, 'the idiocy of today.'What the Coens have maintained is the sleek cinematography and occasional and completely unexpected outbursts of brutal violence that one expects from an espionage film, not to mention completely facetious typewriter-font captions as displayed by the main credits and location footers. This is really the scaffolding of the film's charm.",10,1,6,24 October 2008
Watchmen," A Richly Compelling Experience
","I was skeptical about Zack Snyder as a director before this film. I hated the Dawn of the Dead remake and I thought that 300 was simply an exercise in style and technical mastery with everything else lathered on top. Roughly two hours prior to seeing this film for the first time, I listened to David Edelstein give his review on NPR, saying that Snyder, in showing reverence to the material's roots as a graphic novel, keeps the camera as still as possible and drains the life out of the film. I don't just disagree with Edelstein. I doubt he and I saw the same film. The movie I saw was a masterpiece of spectacle, a liberation of Hollywood style, a richly textured, densely layered epic that boldly inverts all the conventions of superhero movies and comic books. Due to the American victory in the Vietnam War as a result of commissioning two superheroes, Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian, to fight for the U.S., Richard Nixon is shown to be elected to his third term as President. By 1985, however, he has outlawed masked vigilantes and rising Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union threaten a devastating nuclear war. The film begins in the apartment of Edward Blake, whose identity is revealed soon after his brutal murder. Following this is one of the most inventive and mesmerizing opening credits sequences I have ever seen, a montage of historical scenes painting, almost literally, an alternate history from World War II through the 1980s involving masked heroes. The montage plays 'Times They Are A-Changin'' sung by Bob Dylan, and includes implicit twists on historical events such as JFK's assassination.The whodunit of the Comedian's death begins to piece together with a global masterplan. The first phase in the plot may be to eradicate the Watchmen. Unlike the Superman films, for instance, Watchmen understands that it's difficult to profit from the complete devastation of the planet, but there was a nuclear deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that pressured precisely that.The ensemble cast of superheroes (almost outnumbered by the amount of bit players prosthetically masquerading as iconic people of the times) are clad in classic comic book costumes. Rorshach's cloth mask, with its constantly fluctuating inkblots, is one of the most fascinating superhero garbs ever, always in constant motion, telegraphing his black-and- white view of the world, and how his views shift depending on the overriding emotion of his given mood.When I say that I was skeptical of Snyder before, I mean that I felt he didn't quite understand cinema enough to be at the helm of such visionary contributions to it. Dawn of the Dead is screamingly pretentious and 300 is beautiful but shallow. But Watchmen not only leaves such an indelible stylistic impression, but also protects its vision with a certain wisdom concerning starpower. There is hardly a name actor in the film. The most well-known faces in the film are scarce: Billy Crudup is masqueraded entirely in an computer-generated image for the vast majority of his screen time; Carla Gugino has little screen time at all save for scenes that span her character's vast differences in age pertaining to the story. Snyder impresses me here, because he understands that casting major stars in these roles would allow the audience to project their own assumptions of a superstar's persona onto his or her character. And he doesn't want that. He wants these very unique characters to flourish in their own right, and for the actors to serve them, not the other way around.The Watchmen and their distinguished endowments are all the better capable of seeing how weak they really are, and granting all but Dr. Manhattan are human and on the same side, their capabilities are not infinite. Dr. Manhattan, living apart from time and space, is reasonably detached from the future of our infinitesimal planet.Watchmen has a philosophy of time and space that is strikingly similar to that of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. Dr. Manhattan observes his peers knowingly, having learned through his universal superpowers that everything simultaneously exists. Each 'superhero' is deeply flawed, and their effect on the world can hardly be said to be more positive than negative, or more negative than positive. Their effect simply is. By the end, the Diabolical Masterplan that has been discovered is something that Manhattan claims to understand 'without condoning...or condemning.' There is hardly a way to argue against it, even though one knows how monstrous it is. Such dilemmas preoccupy all the Watchmen, and are exhibited in a film experience of unique, arresting beauty. It might seem unlikely to take solemnly a naked blue man, indeed afforded a penis though no discernible testicles, but Billy Crudup brings a moody distance to Dr. Manhattan that is oddly poignant. Does he recall how it felt to be human?Watchmen brings remarkable persuasion to these characters. There is even an unsuccessful attempt by two superheroes to have sex, something to which all humans can relate. One masked avenger is a product of superhero rape. I suppose it's needless to say that the film is exuberant enough to be seen more than once. The more one sees it, the more one has to say about it. It's difficult to master all the niceties and connotations, but also difficult not to have a compelling event.",7,5,10,25 March 2009
Man of Steel," Why So Serious?
","Zack Snyder's charmless reboot drudges along without its having an elite cast making a spot of difference. To begin with, as Snyder should've, why does David S. Goyer cloud, convolute and dampen up an origins story that has held up for 75 years, and why would Christopher Nolan be so enamored of doing so that he would spearhead a whole new franchise? Muddled, uncoordinated flashbacks lead a displaced Jor-El to Metropolis in time for General Zod's arrival on earth to destroy it withsecretly hoarded genetic codes? No trademark costume change, no dumbfounding earthlings with his superpowers and no rapport with Jimmy or Lois Lane. Here, the Daily Planet is as gloomy and underwritten as the obits.The last hour is a thoroughly exhausting, wearyingly preposterous binge of super-colossal devastation that makes you want to escape the movie, for it to just be over so you can leave and go home and watch the original films, a range of equal portions humor, sentimentality and spectacle deftly measured through and contrasted by the grandeur of Krypton and its ultimate destruction, Clark Kent's Spielbergian growing pains and finally his saving of the world from one of its own. Superman is so winning and indelible because despite being invincible, he's trusting, awkward and virginal. And that crucial element makes even those movies' cheesiest moments credible.Crucial to this re-imagining being the antithesis of those classics is Batman apostle Nolan. Whether he's to blame for the movie's overwhelming vainglory and conceit is hard to know but easy to assume. It's so somber, the humor can only ever be from our ironic detachment. One thing is for sure. It's no fun, whether Superman mopes and ponders or he's constantly finding himself in proximity to an unusual amount of disasters. Not only is it perpetually frowny-faced, it's monotonous, unthinking, smothering and so endlessly brimming with explosions that one can't help but flip the bird at the screen on cue.As the obvious, laden and trite dialogue suffers under Snyder's pedestrian helming of quieter moments, the director---with the subtlety of a baboon---ignores pace and running time almost as much as he ignores character and audience appeal as the uncontrolled 'climax' elongates into oblivion, literally, leaving Metropolis an irreparable pile of debris. It needs to be said that the visual effects are as authentic as anything you'll see at the current multiplex. But under Snyder's watch, it's like being constantly clubbed with a Mona Lisa.Above all and more than anything, I so badly wish the movie would have suspended the inundating cavalcade and carved out more than a little wit.",5,2,6,22 August 2014
The Color of Money," The Last Play for the Envelope
","The characters in The Color of Money have a deep love for the game of pool, but what the movie shows us is the intricacies of hustling your opponent and making the proper haggle or deal. However, it's not quite a con film because as the audience, we're looking beyond the money and the hustles. What it seems for the first two acts to mainly be about is the generational divide between the three main characters. Humility comes naturally to the genuine old pro of a bygone generation of hot rods and guys in visors (he assumes Carmen doesn't work), but it doesn't come virtually impossible for the hot-blooded young Brat Pack generation stud (he can't conceive of how appearing to lose helps him win).Played by Tom Cruise the same year he did Top Gun, Vincent is almost too broadly young-dumb-full-of-cum. 'Let's not make a federal production out of it!' During the first half hour, we watch this extraordinarily impulsive guy and are pulled in mainly by the question of how on earth Eddie's going to whip him into some reserved, masterful grifter. The blustering after Eddie saves him from being pulverized by a bar full of angry hustlers, shouting he'll stick a cue down a guy's throat, blow them away with a cannon. What is he, 15? It may sound humdrum, like maybe there's going to be a love triangle that buds from Carmen's own very confidently commercial mind, but this cliché is deferred for the sake of the singular integrity of each of the three central characters. After Carmen sizes Eddie up, only beginning to work her womanly wiles on him before being patently discouraged, she knows she has to take him seriously. What the old man wants, he goes after with expertise, cunningand desperate hunger. And it's compelling to watch him scheme.Scorsese is a master of momentum. Even he himself has expressed on many occasions that he doesn't understand sports, has little interest in them, yet this is his second sports-related film. With Raging Bull, he used that sport as metaphor. Here, he uses game as skill, as art. And the wild results of each situation lead to another set of dramatic circumstances and questions of what each character is intending to happen contrasted with how things play out. Michael Ballhaus' camera is as clever and careful about 'human moves' regarding the characters in front of it as they are. We're pulled into the mental whirlwind of life on the hustle.About 45 minutes in, Eddie shoots his first break in 35 years. Newman perfectly plays a guy who doesn't know if he's still got it, finds out he still does and plays like he already knew, all under a lifelong guise of veteran confidence. Scorsese shoots it perfectly. It's almost like sexual release, followed by the strutting elation that rubs off on Cruise and bonds the two. They're no longer just wise old guy schooling immature young guy. They're a pair of hustlers at the top of their game. But will the young one know how to take it in stride like the old man, or will his ego spin out of control? The dilemma becomes a matter of a jackpot by Eddie who reveals himself to have his own innate approach to the game: He just wants to play and show everyone he's the best. Why should Eddie want to break a horse that's already a champion? How far will he push this young man to recapture his own youth? Scorsese's real achievement here is not merely overcoming the challenge of a sports picture or a johnnie-come-lately sequel, but in pulling us into a character trifecta until the last 45 minutes, during which we see Eddie's quest has never been about Vincent, when there is a shift in the film's tone and atmosphere. Newman's character becomes a machine painstakingly observing a skill to astonishing precision, and that skill comes to be portrayed increasingly less like a hustling device and increasingly more like a reach for the big time.",8,1,2,9 December 2006
28 Weeks Later," A Digression From The Original
","28 Weeks Later has a wonderful beginning. Before anything happens, there is already a quiet tension, a talent being displayed masterfully by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the director in place of Danny Boyle for this sequel. There is great intensity and great moral conflict presented with Robert Carlyle's character. But then, as the film progresses, there is not much more that can be said about it.Yes, when the inevitable gorefest begins again, there are some truly intense and disturbing sequences of rage-infected people and their attacks. Without spoiling anything, one of them involves a single bound person and an infected person's singular, fixated brutalization, and another involves a mass of people locked in a pitch black corridor with a growing number of infected people, the attack being in the dark with occasional flickers of light presenting only two or three frames of horrifying images. However, Fresnadillo becomes too reliant on strobing slow motion and grandiose computerized explosion effects, all of which are a bit dull, with the exception of a later sequence involving a helicopter's blades against a field of rage-infecteds.The violence continues without relief and with a completely morbid atmosphere, and if it were not kicking to the side so many themes and strands, wrapping them up so quickly once the expository portion of the film ended, it would seem handled better. Unfortunately, however, it all grows old and stale after awhile. There isn't much thought given to much of it after awhile. We hear the same dialogue, see the same sort of undeveloped characters, and see the same buckets of blood and gore that we've seen in countless other group-survival-oriented horror and disaster films.Where is the allegory and paranoid awareness of the underbelly of humanity that the original film had that made it so far above the average sort of film, the genre of which I mentioned at the end of the last paragraph? This one even seems to abandon a part of the plot that is presented early on that seems very important.The movie is entertaining enough as a gorefest, a very gloomy, depressing one, but if you're expecting a sequel that lives up to the substance of the original, then don't bother. This is probably just going to turn into just another sloppy slasher franchise.",7,0,2,13 May 2007
The Thing," A Skillful, Though Far-Fetched and Shallow, Gross-Out Flick
","John Carpenter exercises as much control over his films as possible. As a pointer to this, many, including The Thing, bear his name as a suffix of sorts in the title. And Carpenter's film relies on its special effects, which are among the most laborious, revolting, and shocking spectacles by its time accomplished by Hollywood's technical wizards. There are times when it appears we are jutting our heads right down into the rancid, gore-gushing jaws of the unidentifiable, as the Thing metamorphoses itself into creatures with the body parts of dogs, men, lobsters, and spiders, all entrenched in gummy intestines. And Jesus, those poor poor dogs. Designer Rob Bottin's work is groundbreaking and extraordinary, yet because it endures in a near abyss in terms of emotional investment, it becomes too aesthetically oppressive and something of an enterprise in abstract art more than film.A spaceship crash-lands on Earth a zillion years ago and is entombed beneath Antarctic ice. There is an organism in it. It is thawed out and researchers in 1982 are ill-timed in finding out that it has the ability to mimic all life-forms. Its urge to live and enlarge is ravenous. It starts to simulate the sled dogs and then the scientists at a secluded Antarctic research station. The central issue comes to be who is real, and who is the Thing.This follow-up to Escape from New York is a skillful gross-out flick, hands down, not to mention scored not by Carpenter himself as per his usual but by the great Ennio Morricone, who departs from his usual aesthetic and composes a very low-key pulse to the movie. However, John Carpenter's The Thing is ineffective in two regards: the shallow drama and the far-fetched actions of the scientists on this glacial frontier. Characters have never been Carpenter's forte. He prefers to see us cardiac than see us concerned with the traits of his characters. This time, though, regardless of some pragmatic pigeonholing and some competent boilerplates like the Leader, the Screw-Loose and the Lush, he has occupied his ice station with people whose essential function in life is to be accosted from behind, which is all the more disappointing because he casts some really good character actors like Keith David and Wilford Brimley. The few scenes that foster actual drama are submerged by the scenes in which the men are mere trip wires for a blitz by the Thing.That brings us to the other problem, credibility. We know that the Thing tends to bide its time until a character is alone, and then ambush, consume and replicate him. Well, the first instinct against this quandary is a padlock buddy system, nevertheless, constantly, Carpenter lets his characters to ramble off alone and return with odd looks on their faces, until we're almost baffled as to who may have been contaminated and who hasn't. At the conclusion of the movie, the survivors ultimately happen upon another whom they all thought before had either died or been contaminated and imitated. Because it had been made clear earlier that the Thing rips through clothing, why their suspicion of whether or not this returning character is real as he is still wearing the same intact clothing as before? I guess one way to look at all this is the obstacle in the way of their survival: the human weakness of constant proclivity for conflict and suspicion keeping them from an obvious goal. But perhaps that takes more than simply letting them disregard the elephant in the room and devolve into slasher film robots.This ostensible remake is all in all a freak carnival, a make-you-sick movie in which kids on dates can giggle every time there's a scare. There's nothing wrong with that, especially since in that sense, it delivers well. I like being scared and I was scared by various moments in this film. It's readily apparent that Carpenter made his decision at the start to focus on the special effects and engineering and to let the story and people to be a side effect. Since this material has been done before, and to superior effect, as close in release period as Alien in fact, there's no requisite to see this paraphrase except if you are intrigued by what the Thing might look like while starting from slippery, unidentifiable innards then forcing out horrifyingly enormous crab legs and mutating itself into a dog. In which case, see it high.",8,1,3,19 May 2010
The Hills Have Eyes," Still Weighing It
","I've never seen the original Wes Craven version of The Hills Have Eyes, so I will not be comparing this one to that one. However, as its own beast, it's good, but it's frustrating in some ways. It's apart of this new batch of slasher and horror movies, where the cinematography is boisterously gritty and choppy, the script and the acting are more contrived in the melodrama department than horror films before the 21st century, etc. It seems to have boomed since High Tension came to America and though its plot disappointed it carried itself in a manner and style much above average, keeping us riveted with its brutalizing tension and suspense. Its director, Alexander Aja, spends his sophomore effort here with this film.His suspense remains very fulfilling and very nervous, his cinematography is stale and overused by now but it does work well, his attention-grabbing stylistic details are kind of fun, and Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan are good, even if their roles are almost painfully cliché. That is this film's biggest drawback. It not only completes a competent checklist of all horror/slasher/survival film/thriller/sci-fi clichés, but accents a few of the more frustrating ones. Among these particularly frustrating clichés are the use of animal death as a precursor to the terror upon the humans. Yes, I'm very biased because I am an incredible animal lover and I hate it when animal cruelty is seen as 'Hm. Strange,' and when humans are terrorized, not only are they surprised at their dangerous situation after they've practically ignored their pet(s) being mauled, but they treat human casualties as something so incomparable to the death of an innocent animal. But aside from this bias, aren't you tired of knowing as soon as you see an animal in a horror film that that animal is going to die? Another painfully hackneyed inanity here is its entire exposition. The film almost confuses itself, for instance by making Quinlan's character a strict, structural mother and still making her the cool mom that can talk about pot with her kids. The dialogue is so loaded with routine that it defeats itself when trying to develop its characters.The horror franchise is almost founded upon giving the audience what they expect, which is entirely the WRONG WAY TO DO IT. Horror films need shocks and surprises, yet nearly every one, even these new high-production-value slashers, can't help but succumb to them. However, Aja has somehow kept The Hills Have Eyes suspenseful enough to entertain, even if he let it be too much of a stereotype to be memorable.",7,0,2,9 October 2006
North by Northwest," Now I Don't Mind Being Abducted Every Now and Then, But
","Over time, it seems like Hitchcock went from a sure-fire formula for fast-paced thrillers to glossy melodramas to thrillers of a philosophically and symbolically ambitious order. North by Northwest looks like a tinker toy or a daydream after The Wrong Man and Vertigo. Hitchcock and Lehman are not especially serious about their whodunit and allow the spirit of Hitchcock's Gaumont halcyon days to breathe with new VistaVision life. With a whimsical bearing and an offhand drollness, they're spinning their welcomingly familiar wheels right from the start as they unravel a cheerfully unlikely plot. Their literal and figurative pinnacle is carried a little too far and there's the occasional hazier patch, but they do pilot us on a most picturesque, absorbing and joyous chase. Hitchcock's glossy, ironic, mistrustful thriller encapsulated the spirit of the time entirely: Cold War dubiousness, refined modernization, the entomological commotion of city life and a suggestion of alarm behind the silky suits of prosperity.Shadow of a Doubt was another, in my opinion better, thriller by Hitchcock that evoked the darkness beneath a civilized gloss. It was one of the things Hitchcock was best at doing. He could make a cymbal a signal of death and a glass of milk too, for that matter. But what makes North by Northwest charming in its own right, aside from one of the greatest film scores ever written, is its modernism. It's not a matter of tradition as a façade, but the closest thing to the life we return to when the movie's over. This is the world being lived in at the moment of the story's unraveling. And yet you can still be picked out of huge crowd and mistaken for a spy. A fancy art auction can still be a life-or-death strategy game for a microfilm of government secrets.Cary Grant gives the 39 Steps and Saboteur formula a three-dimensional quality with a persona that had aged like wine. Thinking of the dashing, black-haired dork of The Awful Truth or Gunga Din or Arsenic and Old Lace, it's so welcome to see him twenty years later managing those inimitable contortions, flabbergasted looks, nippy grins and gallantry with certified style and refinement. He may be the wrong guy, but he's still culpable for the smugness, materialism and negligence in his expository interactions. Thornhill is a lucrative ad exec, making a living by misrepresenting truth and deluding society. He shall be divested of his self-satisfied finish by progressively more noxious situations, and redress his improprieties before he can be freed from indictments of lethal ones.This, more in the first half of the movie than the second, brings out the best of his bone-dry incredulity. He's hilarious because of how petty he makes his more-than-legitimate outrage seem, like when he tells his kidnappers it's one thing to be abducted, but he had tickets for the theatre tonight that he was very much looking forward to. Even close to the end, he's justifying his endangerment of himself to see all the intrigue through to the finish because he doesn't want to shortchange the incomes of his dependent mother, ex-wife and bartender.Again though, if you need Cary to play off a female co-star, why in the world would it not be Irene Dunne? You need a distinctive, idiosyncratic charmer to add depth to Eve Kendall, because she's nothing more than another in Hitchcock's long line of passive blonde decorations. And after Doris Day drew out one of his fullest, most urgent female performances in The Man Who Knew Too Much, the safe, cursory timidity of the boundaries succumbed to by Jill St. John seems bolstered.While not as cunningly inventive as Strangers on a Train, or as shrewdly flirtatious as Notorious, this is one of Hitchcock's most pleasurable American thrillers. It just doesn't have the drum-tight, pared-down briskness of The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes, so it carries on too long, softening the mold holding together an assortment of scenes and actions it's obliged to make room for, such as the crop-duster sequence of course, as well as the manhunt on Mt. Rushmore, or Thornhill evading his pursuers at an auction by shocking the room with ludicrous bids. Still though, they're model set pieces, with a graciously high cinematic spirit.",8,0,0,3 November 2011
Judgment at Nuremberg," A Resounding Power No Matter What Era In Which You See It
","Tracy channels a refreshing patience as a humble Maine judge exported to don the gown of chief justice in a tribunal comprised of judges facing judges. Clearly, the scales should balance. He and his fellow adjudicators sit across from an even number of other adjudicators. One'd think they'd all see eye-to-eye. And yet, Judge Haywood finds himself indecisive of how four respected judges like himself could've passed sentences resulting in genocide, castration, ethnic cleansing and ultimately, how an entire country could be permissive of these atrocities. The film's his teeming, deliberate process of making up his mind.The black-and-white cinematography emphatically reflects the courtroom environment's utter formality and procedure. Each and every shot's perfectly balanced in equal terms of space, overlapping planes, converging focus. One shot's repeated constantly, the slowly revolving camera fixed on its subject then crash-zooming into that character at a point of rising vigor in his/her monologue. It's very effective, but the sudden crash-zoom's repeated use, rather than once, twice at most, begins feeling rather arbitrary. Why this point in a speech rather than that? Lancaster, though sounding quasi-transatlantically staccato rather than actually German, has the still, silent ferment that brings his symbolic purpose to full impact. For two hours, he's essentially silent, motionless; in the third, he accosts us with one of the most telling, socially aware, discomfortingly honest monologues ever performed. I suspect his character's a symbol because his omnipotent speech condemning himself and his fellow defendants for complicity in the Reich, that it's not that they didn't know the truth but that they didn't want to know, is something that must've been, probably still is, a feeling running to the existential core of many Germans. Yet it doesn't stop there: Why do we Americans support our leaders in punishing minorities, preemptive attacks, an ever-deepening divide between classes? When Lancaster's finished, in another of Kramer's blatant demonstrations of balancing scales, Schell follows his defendant by raising Churchill's premature praise of Hitler, the Vatican's platform of approval. He also mentions earlier an American Supreme Court justice's support of eugenics.It's difficult not feeling a strong connection to Garland as Schell cross-examines her. She bares such pitiful vulnerability, nearly crumbles before our eyes. In a movie constructed mainly of extensive monologue, this scene's comparatively short, yet provokes an impact unique to any of these other powerhouse scenes. The point, seemingly, in the film's larger scope, is not merely her agony but Schell's ruthlessness. In even broader terms, we find that despite Schell's brutally controlling provocation of witnesses, he's not a monster but a great defense attorney, as well as a man of logic fully aware of his courtroom function and as a human being battling his inexorable personal stakes in his defendants' guilt or innocence.Indeed, no central character's either hero or monster. None entirely understand the macrocosmic fulcrum in which they're entrenched. One may find the scenes outside the courtroom dull by comparison, that they could be omitted to streamline the action, mainly where Haywood befriends Dietrich's level-headed German war-widow, who gives him her perspective on the war. But in a film constructed completely on counterweight and parallels, there must be Germans causing suffering, and Germans caused to suffer. Just as there are evenhanded Americans like Haywood and vengeful Americans like Widmark's prosecutor.The nature of Clift's posture, his utter wariness against the past, his debilitating anxiety and feebleness, the texture of his accent, is entrancing. Perhaps it's distasteful to suggest that his deteriorating health and looks resulting from his mid-1950s car wreck was a perk in his later performances, but here, I believe because we associate him with the sublimely handsome young man of I Confess and A Place in the Sun, there's something so tragically off-kilter about him here. But it's not merely the physical post-accident impact, it's equally the devastating vulnerability he carries from a truly pain-filled life that he dauntlessly brings to his astonishing early scene as a truly sympathetic character.The movie's massive in the breadth of its questions of individual complicity in government crimes. Where's the end to the blame? There's no doubt that the men on trial here are guilty. They supported a bigoted, oppressive war machine. But then that must mean that those who supported the men on trial are guilty, and also their supporters' supporters, and so on. What we find at the roots of these apparent sometime advocates of Hitler's regime is altogether a stockpile of rationalization and justification deriving straight from nationalistic pride. 'Above all, there was fear,' Lancaster's Ernst Janning defiantly divulges. 'Only when you understand that can you understand what Hitler meant to usWhat about those of us who knew the words were lies and worse than lies? Why did we sit silent, take part? Because we loved our country! What difference does it make if a few political extremists lose their rights, if a few racial minorities lose their rights? It's only a passing phase. It's only a stage we are going through.' And so on.It isn't just mammoth monologues that gush with subtext, it's also single-sentence replies, such as when Haywood's told, 'Those millions of peopleI never knew it'd come to that,' to which he responds, 'It came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.' That the film ends on that line is a clear alarm bell that this film's not merely an indictment of the Nazis, but the severest warning to all human beings of judiciary positions everywhere. I know that it's become a tired hat-trick to compare any political state of affairs you don't like to Hitler's Reich (I'm talking to you, Beck), but let's be realistic here: What will happen if a government's legal system secures patriotism and nationalism as higher obligations than pure justice?",10,0,1,9 August 2010
Apocalypse Now," All the Children Are Insane
","The most startling thing about Apocalypse Now Redux may not be the reinstated footage, but the new Technicolor dye-transfer prints. Rather than chemical color development, dyes are transferred to the film directly, bringing about the genuinely astonishing '40s, '50s Technicolor look: Sumptuous, striking, razor-sharp, glowing, with deep, authentic blacks. The consequently voluptuous and wringing wet material look of a film like this is what's threatened by digital projection. Coppola also thrusts the blanket off with the re-mastered soundtrack, which envelops us. To return home from the hell-on-earth production situation on the Philippines with a film of such specialized mastery is mind-blowing. It discredits modern apprehension. To watch it is to be elevated to the pinnacle where movies truly can actually take you, but just so seldom do. The film is a timeless cathedral hall echoing with the genuine reverberations of the war in Vietnam, in all their convolution and grief.The story involves a voyage upriver by Capt. Willard, who orders a patrol boat to infiltrate enemy lines and determine the mysterious fortification of the virtually legendary Col. Kurtz, one of the Army's most decorated combatants, now commanding his own group of tribesmen. When you unearth who Kurtz has become and what he is thinking, you can see how the war took such a large role in malforming the elemental American idealism. The movie is a succession of set pieces. The most famed is the attack on a village, announcing itself with the helicopter loudspeakers blaring Wagner at the petrified students and teachers, enduring with Lt. Kilgore, hard-wired to disregard the value of Vietnamese life, and his blustering audacity on the beach, multiple times distracted completely from brutally killed or suffering Vietnamese villagers by the subject of surfing. Other sequences are also in the everlasting remembrance of moviegoers: The drugged tedium of the river expedition, the unexpected barrage of bullets that massacres a boat, the Playboy Playmates entertaining the much too frustratedly eager troops, the trancelike ultimate advance toward Kurtz's compound, the shadowed Kurtz and his grim maxims, the sniggering acquiescence of the stoned photographer, the Citizen to his Caesar.To the magnificence of these scenes in their movement to Kurtz's famous last words, Coppola supplements 49 minutes, most of them invested in a stopover by the platoon to a French cultivated area, a colonial leftover that somehow endures. At dinner the Americans and French argue the colonial saga of Vietnam, and Willard's eyes encounter those of a widow who'll finish the night in his embrace. Other restored footage comprises dialogue and exploits on the boat, later comic relief with the Playmates, and added Kurtz interchange. Most importantly, this Redux is not merely a Lucas- or Spielberg-style 'special edition,' a slight variation on the same song, but an original version of the movie, from scratch. Coppola and his longtime editor Walter Murch, one of the very best at his trade, re-edited the film from the initial uncut raw footage, and so probably even some of the shots that seem the same to us are different takes than those we experienced before.The 1979 version frightened Coppola, he says, feeling it was too long, too bizarre and didn't answer itself in a sort of typical climactic battle. Confronting financial ruin, he fashioned it for the conventional audience of its era, and 20 years later, seeing it again, he found it comparatively meek. To deem this ordeal middle-of-the-road or tame in either form is a peculiar ruling for Coppola to decide on his film, but then he has a record of being rash and perplexing. My own sentiment is that the 1979 version was neither conventional nor tame, but grand, ambitious filmmaking on a magnitude within the spread of but a handful of directors, Tarkovsky, Lean, Eisenstein, Kurosawa. Right down to expressive decapitated heads and the shadow of arrows accosting a boat populated by lost, disoriented men, Apocalypse Now is the modern Aguirre in cinema terms, as well as modern Conrad in literary ones. The Redux consequently prompted my doubts. I was ecstatic to see the supplementary footage. But did the movie require it? No.Regardless, some of the newly seen footage seamlessly crosses the work's threshold and evaporates, deepening it. That would take account of the river footage and some instants with Hopper's photographer. The new Brando footage, including some more barbed examination of the war, is an important adjunct. What gives me the most discomfort is the French plantation sequence. It's protracted enough that it sidetracks from the movie's complete sweep. The river passage sets the film's pulse, and too much time on the banks arrests it. But the sequence is cogent and even abrasive, despite the glaringly cringe-worthy music during the love scene. Carmine's inexplicable use of educational video-level synthesizer music, which is inspired when it's low-key, but is otherwise unforgivable and agonizing. Again, Coppola being completely baffling.Longer or shorter, redux or not, and whether or not one morally agrees with using the actual ritualistic slaughtering of an actual animal as a dramatic tool in a fictitious story, and whatever other issue one may have with a unique cinematic affair of such runaway, limitless passion to an almost transgressive degree, Coppola's overpowering head trip is, regardless, one of the crucial dealings of a film-goer's life, a threshold test, a virtual reality even. To have it in this stunning print is a treat, your eyes and ears awash with its lingering vision and the reverberation from the continuous rotor blades of helicopters and from distant blasts.",10,1,2,7 September 2011
The White Ribbon," A Staring Contest with Danger
","This monolithic piece is set in rural Germany in the years before World War I. All has been calm and resolute in this village for as long as it can remember. Baron, farmer, pastor, doctor, schoolteacher, tailor, servants, children, all perform their designated functions. It is a male-dominated, dogmatic community, that is, the form of community that was common at that time throughout the world. We are told the narrative by the schoolteacher many years after it happened. In the film, we see him young. The old man wants to recount with impartiality and efficiency. He won't deduce or speculate. He doesn't have the answers. He'll consult only the verifiable truth. The initial one is this: While out riding one morning, the doctor was injured when his horse falls over a trip wire. Someone set up the wire. Could they have been certain the doctor would be their mark? Some malicious power is at work in a small village, initially suspected in a chain of unrelated 'accidents.' This compels the villagers, who all know each other, to watch more cautiously. Is one of them responsible? How can that be? One person couldn't be accountable for all of these off-putting occurrences. Have many been overcome by a depraved contamination? We're conditioned to view such plots as thrillers. A film by Michael Haneke is never that cut-and-dried. It all may have been committed, but what if there appears to be no guilty party? What if misfortunes affect good people who are not as good as they believe they are? Haneke's sense is that we can never be sure.Other occurrences transpire. Each of these acts must've been done by someone, but the same person could not have competently done all of them. There is account of where certain people were on certain occasions. It's like an enticement to play detective and figure out the perpetrator. But the evidence never corresponds. Of what would evidence even consist? It might just be a matter viewed from the perspective of distrust. Life goes on in a conventional manner. The baron stabilizes his people. The doctor continues his work, yet he's shockingly callous toward his mistress. The teacher teaches, and the students study, and they sing in the choir. Church services are observed. The white ribbon is worn by children who have been immoral but will now try to be moral. The crops are gathered. The teacher charms the pretty village girl. And doubt permeates. There is an urge to resolve the enigmas. Arbitrary cruel deeds generate chaos and dismantle the people's faith that life falls into place. The idea that the verifiable truths cannot be made to connect is as disheartening as if the earth opened up under their feet.Haneke makes the mystery more intriguing than its resolution. It's too much of a cinch to suggest the film is about the birth of Nazism. If that were so, there would be many more Nazis even now. It is plausible to say that when the suppression of 'terrorism' is valued more than the protection of freedom and independence, tyranny strengthens and becomes its own enemy. If we are to stop terror, someone must be leader. The role of course goes to those focused on exacting control. Accordingly, all not under control is evil and must be stopped, and that's how the benefits of the state become higher priorities than the benefits of the people. Maybe the gist is that we become so unnerved by threat or catastrophe that we'll forfeit freedom, even expect to. Do we believe we're safer in a totalistic society? Many do. But things eventually flare up, and the Berlin Wall falls, or we see the Green Revolution in Iran. The catch-22, as some philosophers have observed, is that activists become consumed with driving their cause that it becomes a vicious circle.For what little respect I have for a filmmaker who authentically slaughters an animal in nearly every one of his films, including this one, I have to accept that many admirable filmmakers have also done less than admirable things as people. Kazan named names. Gibson claimed Jews are responsible for all wars. Ford spent a career teaching a pivotal generation what to think of the savagery of Native Americans and the heroic superiority of their oppressors. Herzog authentically killed an assortment of animals in Even Dwarfs Started Small. We just have to judge their work for its own value, not how it reflects their character. Haneke's ingenuity lies in implanting deep ambiguities in films fixed on the day-to-day lives of everyday people. He cold-shoulders the clear-cut resolutions of most films, in which everything is resolved by the roughshod conquest of one side. His films are like twisted fables, professing that bad things sometimes occur merely because they occur. The cosmos ridicules man-made order and does what it will.The film is aesthetically excellent. It returns to the beautiful artistic density of Ingmar Bergman. It's in black and white, naturally. Color would undermine its impact. In terms of cast, the real stars of the film are the children, who are perfectly cast and oppressed by so few lines they evoke so much disheartenment and bewilderment purely in their faces. Purely as it is, The White Ribbon tells an elementary allegory in a village about little people and indicates that we must face the randomness and unavailing complexity of our universe and achieve equilibrium between doubt and refuge.",9,1,5,22 June 2010
Dreamgirls," Greed and Bad Judgment Bred by Success
","Dreamgirls is not something I would've imagined myself wanting to see at the beginning of 2006, but now that we're at the end of it, I'm so glad I didn't pass it up. It is so full of passion, energy, heart and soul that you feel like every single one of the singers, dancers, and actors has leaped from the screen, shaken you back and forth, slapped you repeatedly across the face, spun you around in circles, and shoved back into your seat by the time the credits have begun to roll. Even if you are not a fan of musicals, you will enjoy this film tremendously if you give it a chance. I promise you. I almost want to give you my name and phone number so that you can call me and tell me I was right, because I will be. I've never been very interested in musicals and glamorous stage productions like that. I've never seen Seven Brides For Seven Brothers or Showboat and may not. All I know is that Dreamgirls is a great movie with success in the writing, the cast, the direction, and the earth-shaking, heart- pumping, explosive music.I think one way to rejuvenate a freshly dead person is for the EMT to play the soundtrack to this film and this corpse will be dancing and jumping and thrusting and spinning around and stomping. In a way, Dreamgirls is a very important film, especially in a time underscored by awful, truly monotonous rap music played by thugs and womanizers who use nothing but drum machines and their brutish and inarticulate speaking voices. This film really demonstrates the mind-blowing volume of the contribution black culture has given to music. It depicts a time and a place in American history when we were just beginning to hear these sounds and were not able to help but be moved by the heart, soul, blood, sweat, tears, and flesh poured outrageously into a single performance. It also depicts the dawn of the debilitating effect industry and profit has that dominates and creates great obstacles for that passion. Everyone from the title performers to Eddie Murphy's Jimmy 'Thunder' Early is riveting. Jennifer Hudson is without argument skyscrapers above what is typically expected of a performer from American Idol. She delivers one of the most shockingly amazing performances as an actress and as a singer that I think I've ever seen. I may not have ever seen anything like it. It's also very refreshing to see Eddie Murphy in a good movie again. This just may be the best film he's ever made, and someone with his talent and presence doesn't deserve a career of bad sequels and awful Z-list comedies, like he's made for himself, and has finally climbed into a role that shows us the fine actor he is, holding down his side of the screen just fine with the subtle tempest that is Jamie Foxx and an old pro in the character actor game like Danny Glover.Bill Condon, the film's director and adapting screenwriter, draws heavily to my surprise from Scorsese, his style being increasingly very clear and gradually more and more blatantly barefaced in the jump-cutting, bull-charging camera movements, and subtle juxtapositions emotionally affected by music. Condon's intense projection of the story is brilliant in its outcome the very same way Scorsese's is, creating a long movie with a ram's pace. Dreamgirls will leave you feeling like a million bucks. It is among the ultimate feel-good films and is one remarkable argument for musicals.",8,1,5,29 December 2006
In the Name of the Father," Never Abandon the Fight to Clear Your Name
","If you avoided this film or put it on the back burner because you thought it would be standard or simply just a people-pleasing, fairly dull drama that would maybe be the kind that would be shown in school because of its cultural value, then just see it for yourself. It's incredibly well- made, it's fast-paced, brilliantly acted, and very passionate and interesting.Standing out in the stunningly engrossing cast are Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson, who are both always wonderfully appealing, and though I'm not sure I'll ever see Day-Lewis in any performance that surpasses the magnetism and captivating charm of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York, he wows here, conveying such a deeply felt character. Thompson, whom I just recently re-watched in Primary Colors as an entirely different character, proves herself a true chameleon, completely taking all forms of her role.It isn't approached from the angle of structuring the story the generally most appealing way, even though it seems like it, intercutting flashbacks with the present and such. It simply follows the characters through their own arcs, and the film becomes the most interesting and engaging film I've seen in weeks. The hardships they endure, the conflicts that fall into their laps, the drama that ensues, and the prospect of justice are all just so absorbing that you have to see it to believe it. This film consumes you.",9,0,0,24 October 2006
Being John Malkovich," Everyone is Searching for Who They Are and Who They Want to Be
","What makes Being John Malkovich provoke so deeply is that it is not simply an oddball flight of fancy but an exploration of Charlie Kaufman's deeply realized questions and thoughts explored through the story. However, the film is certainly pathological in its exploration of themes and modus operandi in ways that are not done in American movies. Its romantic plot strands, its ending, the subplot of revitalizing the art of puppeteering, and the nonchalance of the characters' workplace having low ceilings because of being placed between two normal floors are all either far-reachingly hilarious eccentric ideas much like ones one may conjure when half asleep yet still conscious and visions and even scenarios bleed into your actual environments, or they are aggressively resentful of pat plot tunes.Cusack very comfortably plays a character created by forces not afraid of a hero who's blunderingly unsuccessful with women or not very socially popular. A dark territory where ego has to reach a little bit to get a hold, Cusack, Kaufman, and director Jonze knew that more people would identify with him much more intensely and honestly than a confident, clever, attractive man. He's the id of the creators of the traditional leading man and consequently the men who've grown up latently emulating them. Cameron Diaz has the same attitude towards her role, the personification of the basic drives, feelings, and impulses of the most head-turning social women. Kaufman's characters are amoral and egocentric, ruled just by pleasure and pain.Like all films, there is the love interest, and subsequently the love triangle, but it's not there to fill in any blanks. The female characters are not decoration but very invigorating and thought-provoking characters. Catherine Keener, owner of the most beautiful smile ever captured on film, eats up the screen, just as I would like her to do with me, as a cruelly unattainable object of desire, rejecting not as a reaction but as a first move.Jonze was wise not to employ the safety net of the inventive and meticulously coordinated style of the fascinating music videos he has directed, and instead trusts the effect of Kaufman's inspiring script to stand alone without disaffecting visual technique lathered on top. This film is a highly admirable and important onslaught that hopefully by now has hemorrhaged its influence into the much expressed overcommercialization and underused creativity and exploration of American cinema.",9,6,12,18 April 2008
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Saga Grows with Its Character.
","Like its two predecessors, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an out-of-this-world triumph in production design. But it's the first to depict not only the sensation of yearning propelling the characters at the heart of the world constructed by Stuart Craig, but a grasp of the way the supernatural lies beneath the ordinary, rather than merely frolicking whimsically at a frivolous remoteness from it. It's far less self-conscious about how to gratify an audience as immediately as possible and isn't as unquestioningly cooperative with the conventional modern family blockbuster mold. A new director with a diverse point of view can recoat and ventilate a series that could otherwise fall back on tired reiteration, which it previously seemed poised to do, and Alfonso Cuaron, a clever, unique and energetic filmmaker with a highly sensitive eye for quirky nuances, has done what few sequel custodians ever achieve or care to achieve, stimulating the characters and story arcs.His exceptionally lensed wizard cosmos is coarser and grittier than Chris Columbus's. It seems immediately more hazardous, more utterly captivating and more authentic. While the two first installments were set largely in the passageways and classrooms of Hogwarts, this one stays behind in the eerie forests and soggy pastures outside the school walls, a backdrop that accentuates Cuarón's flair for inducing the poignant, physical influence of natural environments. His work always having crossed all cultural and stylistic barriers, his was a name that was certain to electrify the spirits of critics more than the greater part of die-hard Harry Potter aficionados, who tend not to see many unrated, subtitled films or to be familiar with the names of many foreign filmmakers, were prone to react with a shrug.Harry, Weasley and Hermione drift on the threshold of teenage years, and whereas they seem nervier and more competent than before, the perils they confront appear far more serious and their own vulnerabilities deeper. At the start, in the compulsory Muggle-baiting scene, Harry's boiling resentment at his orphaned situation and his malicious adoptive keepers finally overpowers him. As the plot follows him---as opposed to normal, in which he's a piece of a clockwork plot---toward a battle with the man who allegedly slayed his parents, a fugitive convict played by the great broad-spectrum villain Gary Oldman, Harry's carefree civility is dimmed by sorrow, anger and moral bewilderment.If Rowling's success is in not allowing her child characters to languish but thoughtfully delving into their maturation in a way that only some, if any, children's literature have before, then the films' producers' is in electing Cuarón to take charge of the franchise's first physical and mental transitional stage. Not only is Harry getting bristly, but Weasley and Hermione are shedding their juvenile hides in surprising ways, and Cuarón stages everything about their lives in a minor register. The soundtrack buzzes with recognizable themes, only now heard in minimal arrangements on archaic instruments instead of the swanky orchestrations of the first two films. The pubs now look authentically aged and dilapidated. The Hogwarts castle now sits among a much less steady, much more jagged panorama. Colors are subdued. Cuaron's signature use of hand-held verite-style camera-work contributes a further closeness, occasionally a claustrophobia that's precisely truthful. Even the costumes echo the fidgety contradiction of character moods: The Harry's school uniform tie is at all times crooked.Sinister and visceral, this really is a grim fairy tale, in which Harry confronts bigger doubts and threats than before when he would play Culkin to Voldemort's many Pescis and Sterns. And I don't mean Sirius Black. What great madcap wizard doesn't seemingly target Harry? Before Harry even disembarks for his third year at Hogwarts, it's obvious that threats will come from within. Cuarón and recurring screenwriter Steve Kloves deal with antagonistic, temperamental adolescence like Stephen King: Harry's thick with anger, almost savoring too much the intoxicating occult capability he has. The literal flare-up of infuriated conjuring he directs at Uncle Vernon's thoroughly deserving sister evokes Carrie at the prom. The first scene, right from the start: What happened to our kind, wholesome little Harry?",9,0,1,21 May 2011
Ratatouille," Brilliant
","What Ratatouille's got that nearly every other family film hasn't got is that everything about it is honest and real, with of course the exception of little nightclub societies of rats. It explores many things that I think it's wonderful that young kids will see at an early age in a film like this, a family film, the kind that they should trust. One major thing I'm speaking of is the atmosphere and portrayal of Paris and the nature of the restaurants. Not only do we learn about the foods and what goes on in the kitchen, but we also see customers that are insinuated as rich Americans who visited the restaurant last time they vacationed in Paris and always get the same thing, and other such details. The film is rich rich rich with details, by the way, which should fascinate all who see this, young and old alike.But what I'm really getting at when I say Ratatouille is more honest and true to life is it's truly profound message, a deeper, more thoughtful one than most family films. I'm not saying that family films necessarily all have token messages and common sense morale. I'm saying that hardly any of them truly say anything thought-provoking the way this one does. It's about creation against simple survival. It uses its fun little concept of a rat who prefers fine cuisine to garbage to maturely symbolize that theft is simply surviving, and adds nothing and gives nothing, whereas creation is making your mark on existence, and exercising life and earning the finer things. The film glorifies sophistication as well as it parodies prudish French poise.The only flaw in the film I see is the stale device of the fantasy guardian angel of the fat deceased master cook Chef Gusteau. What this particular role in the film delivers could be done in the clever way everything else is.You may wonder why I feel that this is one family film where kids can trust its realism when the film is about a talking rat that controls and understands human beings. Well, I can support my point about the film's message by referring to a clever key scene near the beginning where we see that rats talking to each other from their point of view, then briefly see the rats having the same conversation from a human's point of view, and it's made clear at that point that, though we as the audience understand them when they speak in Patton Oswald's voice, they can only be vocally understood by each other and not by humans. I told you the film is rich with details most family movies wouldn't have. You'll be shocked at its maturity.",10,0,0,16 July 2007
Aliens," No, It Doesn't Match the Original, So Stop Pretending
","Ridley Scott's superb Alien opens in a completely foreign atmosphere, making us want to be there, attracting us mysteriously. The camera moves around slowly and quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right under our noses. James Cameron's Aliens is too impatient. There is no build-up of suspense, there are constant close-ups, everybody's made up to look attractive, and the exposition is only long because it seems to think that extension equals suspense, or that there's some quota to fill and then you can play around with your big guns and gore all you want. Cameron presents us with an action film, big fun, special effects, blow this up, blow that up, but there is an hour and 45 minutes of waiting around for it, and less than an hour of action and violence. There is a good 20 minutes of nonstop action that is actually paced quite well and feels very intense, but it's aggravating to be kept from it for so long just so the film can appear as patient and effective as the original.The original Alien knew the magic of claustrophobia and the effect it can have. Cameron's nature is to do everything he can to outdo. So, he makes a bigger movie, with a bigger cast, and a bigger spaceship and bigger, louder scenes of violence, when that is not what you need to outdo the first Alien. There's nothing wrong with making the sequel more of an action film than a suspense film, but instead, he donned the film with the appearance of being patiently suspenseful and, since the film is about a big bunch of marines going to blow everything up and the film makes no attempt to be subtle, all we're doing is sitting and waiting, whereas in Ridley Scott's original, we were sitting bruising our dates' forearms.One thing I must add though, is that Jennette Goldstein should've become something bigger than she was. She is a fantastic actress, and extremely hot at that. She's the biggest highlight next to Bill Paxton here in Aliens, as she is to Paxton in Cameron's once wife Bigelow's Near Dark. She should've become a star.",8,8,15,16 July 2007
The Exorcist," A Powerful and Novel Approach to Horror Cinema
","Oddly, it's sometimes the repulsiveness of imagery that surpasses 'horror,' becoming captivating in its revoltingness. This contrary advantage of primeval effect is the core of Friedkin's vision. Regan's thrashings are ugly, ferocious, but they've such effect on us since it's seen: Friedkin directs the viewpoint of these moments from the point-of-view of those seeing.And each setting's especially natural. This is also what made Jaws so exciting. No Transylvanian mansion with thunder, lightning. Throughout the whole scene between Burstyn and Cobb's detective, there's a deathlike silence. Just their voices, the sporadic tinkle of a cup. This amplifies our sensations. Burstyn's agitation becomes ours. Seconds after Cobb departs, Friedkin stuns the tautness with a piercing clatter and Regan's shouts. Burstyn dashes inside the room to terrified astonishment as books, papers, records, toys orbit hysterically.Visually plot items are realized with that contrary entertainment. Friedkin augments the authenticity of these scenes by not underscoring them. The dialogue, sounds, images bring the effect. And Friedkin knows how to develop to that dreadful pragmatism. Firstly, Regan says her bed shakes. We glimpse a black-and-white photograph of her, adding plain uneasiness to her pose. When she urinates on the floor at the party, the abnormality becomes visual. Seeing's believing.Friedkin intensifies each new shock, culminating in the masturbation, surely the most powerful moment due to the degree of debasement. We're constrained to watch, as Friedkin's wicked advantage is the lure of unspecified dread brought alive. Friedkin creates apprehension with his first image, black-and-white sunrise dissolving to an overwhelming orange. One practically feels the gleaming surges of heat. At the archaeological site, picks strike soil, sounds intensifying, shriller still when Von Sydow trembles finding the talisman.Apprehension becomes conflict. Von Sydow informs the keeper that he must leave. Then, he's almost run down by a black horse and carriage, a malevolent forewarning. Friedkin visually achieves a sensation that something horrific's impending. Von Sydow searches through the ruins, and faces Pazuzu's massive, menacing statue. Dogs fight ferociously, the effigy rigid versus the wailing winds while Von Sydow's bowed figure stands in bold resolve, action illuminating character.The feeling of dread and fear lives not just in the shadows but in broad daylight. Friedkin dissolves to barking neighborhood dogs in the damp gray over Georgetown, the bedroom of Burstyn, who hears bizarre scraping from her attic. Friedkin's taken us to a climax, a fearsome, unrestrained world, then deposits like a ride, gets underway again to the next climax. In illustrating the bizarre but accurate, the biological and cognitive potential justify the possession, also utilized to exciting, vile effect.As each medical option's reduced, the tension mounts as we see the possession intensify, causing Friedkin's attaining our surrender, agreement. Burstyn's sure Regan necessitates a priest. Burstyn's portrayed, basically, as an atheist, though her passion in this situation persuades us that she's certain her daughter's definitely possessed. The horrors begin in ordinary settings. Once we behold the cross masturbation, Friedkin's taken us from leg-pullers like attic scratchings to Regan's vicious, outlandish doings.Screams intensify tension, topping scenes emotionally. Friedkin employs sound as character. We're pacified fleetingly by silence, then the scream shocks. The distinction from tranquility to disorder in the dream sequence has the upshot of thrashing us instantaneously from relative comfort to a animal anxiety.Moreover, the handling of light contrasts is effective for its paradoxes. As in the dream, silver medal strikes black rock, cut to Regan in a vibrantly lit examination room, an icon of righteousness descending onto blackness, contrasted with Regan's hideous exploit in the barren luminosity. Familiarities such as tennis-playing students juxtaposed with Inspector consulting Miller about church defilements and McGowran's bizarre demise. Even in the daytime terror of the masturbation a gloomily shadowed image crowns the moment before the subsequent luster. Friedkin's most dazzling paradoxical disparity's in Von Sydow's re-emergence, a black outline in the lone gleam, wearing all black, invigorating the impression of wickedness Friedkin's founded, handsome visualizations assuming threatening connotations.The possession's cruelty is directly counter to Miller's vulnerability-become-power-via-selflessness. When he's introduced, he's visiting his mother in a dilapidated apartment. Her delight at seeing him is unadulterated, but he's swarming with self-reproach. He advises other priests but thinks he's losing his faith. When his mother dies, his remorse crushes. Nevertheless, despite private difficulty and misgiving, he does battle for a stranger. While he's not swayed it's a possession, Miller acquires the bishop's consent to do an exorcism. To Miller's disenchantment, Bishop thinks it best to have a man with practice: Von Sydow exorcized a demon years ago in Africa. Friedkin again expresses that Von Sydow and the demon are deep-rooted enemies, from their confrontation in the ruins to Regan's manifestation intensifying with Von Sydow's entrance.Friedkin advocates no principles, just illustrates the dismay defeated via fierce eradication. Nevertheless, it's the majestic shock of Miller's ultimate revelation and sacrifice that outdoes 'horror,' becoming enlivening. It's all the power of a twilight sky observed through a nihilistic lens.",10,6,8,3 October 2008
Saw III," No Comparison To The First Two
","What a way to ostensibly finish off your franchise. This franchise has been the group of the most ideal horror films, at least for me. Once I got through Saw, it shot straight up to the top of my list of best horror movies. Despite what snobs may say about it, it has everything the perfect horror movie should have. It has a scary, claustrophobic atmosphere, characters that aren't stupid teens going camping, eery abstract music, constantly different killings, and never a happy enough moment. It really had an effect on me, an effect that really shuddered me, because I'm not used to being truly scared by a horror movie the way I'm supposed to be. Only a handful of other horror films have scared me substantially. Saw II, though it didn't scare me as much, still maintained a creepy if not claustrophobic atmosphere and effected me with gore the way very few other films have. Saw II has a great understanding of the sensitivity of body parts like eyes and veins and knows how to get the audience's goat by exploiting them. Saw III is lackluster in both the scariness of the original and the gore disturbance of the second one.Saw III was said to be gorier than the first two films put together, and what it really is is lacking in the amount of gore of either of them individually. Yes, it has some gritty scenes and plenty of blood and body parts, but it's far from consistent and never is it as terribly creative or shocking like it is with its predecessors. Its atmosphere is not very creepy, either. The way the first film was claustrophobic in that it put us directly in the characters' bone- chilling situation, this film is claustrophobic in that it's missing something by not expanding further. We keep feeling like there's supposed to be more to the story, more to the action, more to the violence and the horror, but there isn't.This third installment in an otherwise brilliantly frightening series of movies insults the audience's intelligence in the execution of its twists, it ends too quickly to be affecting, and its plot itself seems forced. A part of the story that I like involves its main victim, a grieving man whose son was killed who is pitted in games wherein he has to battle himself and control his vengeful thoughts. I also like seeing behind the scenes of the first film, the showcasing of the first film's backstory, even if knowing everything now that we didn't know when watching it---even if it's a severance for the most chilling parts of its story---detracts from the fright. It may not be as scary anymore with the footnotes Saw III provides.",7,2,3,5 November 2006
Tropic Thunder," Promising Start Then Wrings Itself Dry Even Before Halfway Mark
","I will begin by saying that fortunately there are no token female characters. Ben Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen (I swear they hired him for his name) are mature enough not to contrive any demeaning roles for actresses when they aren't necessary in a movie about the making of a Vietnam war film.All but stealing the show, Robert Downey Jr. is not merely funny but also very good and sometimes even subtle as Kirk Lazarus, an Australian actor who has won five Oscars and has surgically dyed his skin to transform himself into a black man. So committed is he to this role that he remains in character at all times, seemingly convinced that he is actually black.This exasperates his fellow actor Alpa Chino (ha), a rapper who was born black and blasts Lazarus for his method acting delusions. I'm going to take the opportunity to say that Alpa Chino, like many rappers viewed by many blacks as demeaning, promotes his own chauvinist merchandise, notably Booty Sweat, an energy drink that keeps him going in the jungle. It's also intimated at one point that Chino is gay, meaning that he is posing as something he is not as well. So let us stop the 'controversy' over this 'troublesome' issue of the film. Anyway, Lazarus is nit-picking of Tugg Speedman (Stiller's character), who starred in a terribly unsuccessful family film called Simple Jack, a movie reminiscent of Jack with Robin Williams or a low-grade Forrest Gump, about a mentally handicapped farmer who thinks animals can understand him.Unfortunately for this movie, it is Simple Jack that saves their lives when they're taken prisoner. The bored druglords have only one video, an old Simple Jack VHS, and think Speedman is Jack himself. It is here where the movie really starts to overexert itself. The movie opens with promising trailers establishing three of the characters, not only Lazarus and Speedman, but Jeff Portnoy (a typically livewire Jack Black) whose specialty is fart humor. The promise of the trailers is gratified by the hilarious subsequent scene: During the shooting of the memoir of Nick Nolte's creepy Vietnam veteran, the stars, one an action star Tugg, one a five-time Academy Award-winner, one a rap star, one a low-brow drug-addled comedian, and a character actor, behave unreasonably and self-importantly, resulting in a $4 million explosion going off with no cameras shooting. With filming a month behind schedule only five days into shooting, the media dubs it the most expensive war movie never made. The frustrated and scapegoated rookie director played by Steve Coogan is ordered by the artfully profane studio executive played by a shockingly made over Tom Cruise to get the production back on track or risk having it shut down. With inspiration from Nolte, the director drops the indulged and pampered superstars into the middle of the jungle, where he implausibly mounts hidden cameras and special effect explosions manipulated so that he can film guerrilla-style.If you saw the film up to that point, you would not understand why I'm so disappointed in it, because it really is hilarious up till then. It simply takes a nosedive by further developing its brilliantly narcissistic characters in such hackneyed caricatures and relying upon screaming and explosions for cheap laughs.The breadth of Ben Stiller's film however is quite amazing. It's a war epic, an echo of Altman's The Player, and an echo of his own Zoolander, and it is the only thing that could end the four-week roll of The Dark Knight. So I will give him that, because in spite of any grave and fatal flaws, it certainly is an intriguing vision. And anyway, it's on Stephen King's list of favorite films of 2008. And so who can argue with Stephen King?",6,0,1,20 October 2008
Die Hard 2," Bruce WillisOur Last Line of Defense
","Die Hard 2, subtitled Die Harder, barges Bruce Willis into an obstacle course of rapid brutality, and he finishes in front in each one, such as in mortal tussles for guns, leaps onto conveyor belts, a discharge from a cockpit, leaping onto the wings of planes about to take off and fighting with cops and bureaucrats. All in one day! Why is Willis so persuasive in a movie like this? Perhaps he associates a roughly strapping build with the bearing and behavior of Everyman. The title of the movie characterizes the essential story material: Here is a man who will not bail out, who will not concede failure, who determinedly persists through the threat of catastrophe. The trials and hazards he encounters would dishearten a Jason Bourne or a 007, but for this guileless cop with the receding hairline, there is no option. When all is said and done: 'My wife is on that plane!' McClane seems to have the worst holiday luck I've ever heard of as he's in Washington's Dulles airport expecting his wife's flight to land on a congested Christmas Eve. And scheduled into the same airport simultaneously is a military jet bringing a South American drug overlord to justice. An expert crew of terrorists, led by a former CIA operative, plots to take command of airport operations by mechanically circumventing the control tower. They'll interfere with the airport lights, leave dozens of planes circling overhead and then bring about fatalities, as a heads-up. What they want is a standby plane prepared to shanghai the fascist away.Willis, who has a cop's seasoned eye, pegs one of the accomplices, follows him into a luggage-handling area and finds that a plot is brewing. Regardless, he can't get anywhere with the chief of airport security Dennis Franz, who begrudges an outside cop in his jurisdiction. After a death and countless other indications including a plane crash, the security chief ultimately concedes he may have a dilemma to deal with. But even then Willis' work is not finished, and by the end of the movie he is still virtually unassisted contending with entire planeloads of militants in mortal combat.This is the archetypal big-budget blockbuster Hollywood action movie with rapid cutting and a fast-moving, bombastic narrative. Since it is so capably hammered out and well-directed, it cultivates a propulsion that hoists it past various and sundry plausibility fractures, indeed canyons, that should have toppled it. Exhibit A, at some point at roughly the middle of the movie we find out that 'there are 18 planes up there but only 5 of them have those phones.' OK! Great! Now the pilots can inform each other that the airport is in the midst of a siege and they shouldn't listen to the phony tower. Yet, because the script insists that they remain in peril till McClane saves the day, they all heed the same approach tower frequency. What's more, how about the scene where the tower apprises the circling airplanes that they'll be out of radio contact for a couple of hours, and the jets should simply continue circling? Why can't those planes just get on the horn with other ground broadcasters, and be redirected to other airports? Weeeellthen Willis' wife wouldn't be up there in the sky and in grave trouble, that's why.But a more fundamental issue concerns the entire liberation undertaking itself. Who would ever have the funds, the apparatus and the conviction to stage such an enormous and problematic terrorist operation just to bail one drug-connected dictator? However, be that all as it may, I don't care. Die Hard 2 is as absurd as the Bond pictures, and as much fun. And during a Hollywood period (the '80s and '90s) when violence and mayhem are sanctioned to usurp creativity and substantial drama, this is a particularly skillful picture. It tells a story we can relate to, it has many colorful peripheral characters and it handles the action sequences---not to mention location shooting in extreme conditions---with seemingly effortless purity.There is a plane incident to which degree we weren't sure things would go as far, and it's quite shocking. Another fun moment features a mercenary's opportunity to get an up-close look at an icycle. Another shot places the camera's eye hundreds of feet waaay up in the air and then flings Willis up until his nose just about butterfly-kisses the lens before he begins to fall to Earth again. The director of this snug $70 million comfort food is a Finn named Renny Harlin, whose other credits include the unrealistic but exciting Cliffhanger, the tiringly escapist but hilariously gruesome The Long Kiss Goodnight and the excitingly ridiculous Deep Blue Sea. Like Dutchmen Paul Verhoeven and Jan de Bont, Harlin took Hollywood commercial movie-making, churned it and endowed it with fresh momentum.",7,0,2,24 May 2010
Quantum of Solace," Perhaps the Most Stylistically Unique of the Bonds Pictures
","One criticism I've heard from critics regards the opening car chase, with Bond under constant machinegun fire, that it's so hurriedly cut and accused of obvious but perplexing CGI, that for the most part we're looking at blurred images leaping off each other, intercut with Bond at the wheel and POV shots of approaching monster trucks. I was surprised to find I did not agree with this common critique. My only problem was that hundreds of rounds of machine gun spatter as close as they are to Bond's very back windshield seem to just disappear into thin air, but of course Bond fires a single final shot that not only successfully wounds one of his dispatchers but sends the pursuing car over the cliff to crash and burn. But hey, when has an action hero ever been killed by machine gun fire, regardless of the seemingly endless ammunition hailed upon him?One of the more annoyingly titled Bond efforts, the movie's titular Quantum organization's objectives and values are entirely unknown, but they favor the shadows. All they seem to do is hire mercenaries to fulfill hits to control being implicated in them, and the lead villain here schemes for his branch-off company to manipulate Bolivia's water supply, which I assume is part of a larger plot to be revealed in the 23rd film.This direct sequel to Casino Royale is directed by perhaps the most stylistically unique filmmaker to be at the helm of the uber-commercial 007 franchise, Marc Forster. There is actually a bit of the director reflected in the finished product this time. As, Amalric wanted to wear make-up for his role as the ruthless lead villain, but Forster made clear that he wanted Greene not to look bizarre, but to appear as the charming and attractive young actor always does to symbolize the veiled evils of society. To the die hard Bond fan, this could go two ways: A plus or a serious minus. The reason the first 21 Bond films were far removed from personal artistic control was because there are olden customs indoctrinated into the cinematic Bond tradition which must not be compromised. Quantum of Solace compromises them for the first time since Dr. No. Bond does not sleep with Bond girl Olga Kurylenko. This I admire. She is not a bimbo but a strong female character on her own vendetta. Maybe the pattern of chauvinism in these movies is finally tapering off with Craig's arrival.Daniel Craig is a strong actor, especially in testosterone-leaning movies. So, he continues to be a good Bond, but this second outing for him marks him as the least conversational Bond in almost 50 years. M has more dialogue than 007, who has become a normal schmuck who asks for normal drinks. Greene is not a cartoon villain in the least, in fact quite a topical one. Also no Moneypenny.I understand the purists, because the recent series reboot is growing further removed from the spirit we've been used to, one which has not so much been lost but has been built upon since 1962. It feels like Brosnan's been gone a lot longer than he has. But here's the thing: That's OK. Brosnan was the closest we got to Sean Connery since Sean Connery, and it was a great seven years. But since when does the strict maintenance of all the proper traditional elements serve the purpose of creativity? Perhaps the 23rd and 24th Bonds will continue in an even fresher direction.However, I did have a problem with the movie's disregard for tradition. We're beginning to lose the dry humor and snooty British suavity. Those two things are vitally important to the James Bond movie. Bond is becoming Bourne, which is to say he's becoming more and more American all the time. Our franchises must not absorb the cultural diversity and personality in its universal trends, which in this case is the robotic muscleman on a vendetta. I'll tell you who I liked better than Bond: CIA go-between Felix Leiter, played by the wonderful Jeffrey Wright, whose rise to stardom seems to be going slowly but it's definitely a sure thing. He gives Felix, who for years has been a stick figure, an individualism hiding under his stoic shell which eavesdrops in scenes of CIA plotting, rather than merely listening.I am also a fan of the, so far, underrated opening title sequence, in which brilliant songwriter-bandleader Jack White and the quite talented Alicia Keys perform the oft- disparaged theme song which, with its clear focus on recording studio production, mixed acoustic and electric instrumentation, vocal-centric aesthetic and signature White Stripes rhythmic feel, does not stray far from good spy film music in the least, as has been said by many critics.My verdict is that Bond 22 is not one of the lesser Bond pictures, yet the series has a long way to go before the filmmakers will feel comfortable enough to truly take a unique stylistic turn, for here, we just have another unforgettable but visually juicy action entertainment.",8,2,4,25 November 2008
The Dirty Dozen," Inglorious as Ever
","This out-of-the-box milestone in the American war genre kicks off on the edge of pure malevolence, the hanging of a pitiable, groveling military prisoner, pleading for mercy. Witnessing the execution is Lee Marvin's Major Reisman, who appears inflexibly distanced, but we soon find that this is in part a subterfuge. His presence at the hanging was somehow an infliction by his arch-rival ex-commander, Robert Ryan's Colonel Breed, who always finds new ways to make Reisman suffer quietly. The sole power mitigating these adversaries is Ernest Borgnine's competent but equally stubborn General Worden, who gives Reisman the newest in a string of patience-testing duties: Pending D-Day, Reisman is to head a squad of twelve soldiers to a remote French estate where various eminent German officers will be socializing to exterminate a key share of the Nazi pecking order just early enough to render the Germans powerless facing invasion. Desperate enough, and Reisman understands. The predicament is that his eponymous dozen are to be amassed from the lines of military detainees, condemned for murder or other appalling offenses.So even before he ushers a platoon into its virtually guaranteed slaughter, Reisman must train that group from twelve brutal psychos, who are a colorful balance of archetypes: the honorable sort fallen into damnable circumstances, Charles Bronson's glacial Wladislaw; the livewire fueled by rancor and bitterness, John Cassavetes' Franko; Trini Lopez's pleasant Chicano Jimenez; Jim Brown's the self-protective black man Jefferson; Donald Sutherland's amiable dunce Pinkley; and Telly Savalas' smiling lunatic Maggott, whom God tells to slay loose women.Deceptively formal, the movie smites into three quite clear-cut acts: In the first, we Reisman gather our crew of outcasts and swiftly learn that, to make good troopers of them, he must crack their angry spirits. In the second, the crew, having solidified under Reisman's authority, learns to collaborate implicitly and be a relentless force; in the third, they carry out their blood-spattered onslaught on the château. The dramatic tension crescendos, and so does the film's dissonant pitch. Indeed, the emotional arc divides into thirds, too, starting with the bleak and dishonorable introduction. That callous hanging supplies the threat over what ensues, whether it's the glare of utter hatred in the characters' eyes, or Reisman's unequivocally distant method of psychologically tormenting his underlings. The final act eschews implied horror for in-your-face brutality.Aldrich, whose career beyond this film unfortunately hasn't much endured in the collective awareness, was one of those directors who was bold enough to gaze, undaunted, at the butchery his characters' behavior produced, and his staging of the climactic carnage is utterly unfeeling, truly one of the most acidic reminders of the battlefield's absolute amorality I've ever seen: There are no good and bad sides anymore. But there is definitely still camaraderie, as each character casualty feels both outrageously unexpected and excruciatingly protracted. Aldrich's unique, subversive vision is the prevailing influence on Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, both portraying a massacre in which Nazis are annihilated in a manner that assumes distinctive visual ricochets of the Holocaust. It is, frankly, a very delicious war movie, bobbing and weaving sharply through one of its decade's most atonal screenplays, commandeered by one of the very finest directors of Hollywood's transitional phase.But what of the mid-section, considerably the most protracted? All in all, the stage during which the Dozen begin to faithfully rally as an efficient brotherhood foreshadows not the bravado of its blood-doused culmination, but the terrain of Hogan's Heroes. The disposition of this innermost tier is emphatically that of Dude, Chance and Colorado making music in the jail, or Cool Hand Luke winning the respect of Dragline and his posse. Reviewing their grand imminent mission smacks of the cheerful bluster of a caper movie. There's an extensive sequence in which Reisman proves to Reed the efficacy of his men with a cunning war game that, aside from being thrilling in its own right, makes us laugh audaciously somewhat like when Duke and the other M*A*S*H boys uncover the shower tent to prove Hot Lips Houlihan's a true blonde.The movie swings so very brusquely from blustery bit of cockamamie entertainment about mischief makers in war to revolting, spirit-demolishing picture of men dying in a genuinely throttling finale, with deftly unseen transition, brought off by Aldrich's harshly resourceful directorial style, and an astoundingly choice dramatis personae. Does Reisman need the weather-beaten apathy that Marvin brings to him, or does it just look like it because Marvin's personification of those ideas is so naturally graven? Likewise, the very corporal look of many other players fortifies the distillate of each character in fast-sketch, for instance Borgnine's bloated, beleaguered Worden, and Bronson's swarthy, pensive Wladislaw.The first two hours are such a good-humored model of the Hollywood system fermenting a grim yet unchallenging war film. But Aldrich and his writers deliberately elicit that heavy sudden swing into capricious mayhem as a way of pulling the rug out from under the emblematic spirited combat picture. By bringing its curt climactic setback full circle to the grisliness of the beginning was able to be concocted into a willful and lasting bushwhack.",10,1,4,3 November 2011
Gone with the Wind," I Don't Feel Sorry For You, Confederacy
","Imagine if Schindler's List was made from the Nazis' point of view, with our sympathy being invested in them. That is my way of describing Gone With the Wind. It's a bona fide epic of absolutely magnificent film-making that, since it can hold its own shockingly well right now in 2007, must've been the holiest of holies in 1939, but it's made from the point of view of the Confederates during the Civil War. Hello. They wanted to perpetuate slavery. This film is an adaptation of a novel that works as propaganda for the wrong people. That's not excusable the way The Godfather is excusable in its glamorization of an organized crime family or Cool Hand Luke's glamorization of prisoners. This film actually makes these slaves look healthy, well-fed and treated with dignity, downplays the wrongful deaths of loyal horses, and treats the South's blind pride and nomadic, Leonine attitude towards anything nonchalantly, like we aren't supposed to analyze it.Somehow, I find myself hopping on the band wagon anyway and finding this film to be great. Margaret Mitchell, though she is the brain behind the film's aforementioned justification of the Confederacy, writes a story with unabashed love and emotion. Eventually, we learn to love these characters as individuals, the drama is constant and affecting, and thus the film overall is a very intense experience. The film's cast is led by the tremendous performance of Vivien Leigh, whose realization of hot-headed, selfish, greedy, impetuous and aggressive Scarlett O'Hara is clearcut and realistic. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the oldest slave who is somehow able to bark orders and take charge in some situations, has riveting moments of her own, especially one near the end that has an almost contemporary feeling in its elusive steadicam shot that loses itself in her gushing monologue. Olivia De Havilland inspires the most emotion from the audience, becoming the sweetest and most compassionate character you could imagine in that particular time and place, almost like an otherworldy personality in that setting.The cinematography, the most staggeringly beautiful thing about the film, is full of beautiful framing, rich colors, and a look as if it were made just this year. There is a scene where Leigh and De Havilland are speaking in a dimly veiled room, and we only see their silhouettes. This is breathtaking film-making for 1939. The music is wonderful and lush, the epitome of a large-canvas orchestral score.However, I could never see this film ever again. The length is not what bothers me, because there are many favorite films of mine that I would not mind any more if they were four hours long, but if the first two hours were as hard to swallow as those of this film, I definitely would. This movie's first half panhandles for our sympathy during scenes of wounded Confederates and weeping townsfolk. It displays a society that was naive, barbaric, and lazy yet arrogant, proud, and melodramatic, two trios of adjectives that are preposterous when hand in hand. However, once the intermission is over, the second half begins, and that is when the film is truly interesting to me. It becomes a saga that could've been set in many different contexts, because the last two hours are all about the individuals themselves and the motives each of them have that tie themselves in knots. The drama then is truly felt by me.Let me finally note that the only older film available in any of the six video stores in Gatlinburg, Tennessee is Gone With the Wind.",6,3,8,9 August 2007
No Country for Old Men," A Study in Frontier Logic
","No Country For Old Men is a film that is carefully, meticulously constructed to linger, which it does. It's a film that, despite its cold, ominous eccentricity, is very down-to-earth, pessimistic, and wise. It's imagined so precisely that many details will not dawn on you till later, the appearance of a limping dog early in the film for instance. The film progresses naturally, untouched by any sort of convention, vogue or standards, and moves by way of its deep-rooted outlooks and views.Visually, No Country For Old Men is of the highest cinematic order. The camera moves so deliberately and many images extract so many microcosms in life, a translucent reflection in a blown-out keyhole for example. Many shots rely more on a dooming presence in the out-of-focus background than in the unsuspecting foreground. Violence is portrayed on and offscreen as genuinely as this ungoverned yet restrained film possibly could. It's a standard-setting work of cinema, if that isn't shamelessly extreme in complement. It's so solid, you feel like you could go to Google Earth and rove around its settings finding no boundaries that divide the film set and the real external world. What I found to be outstanding, a strenuous thing to be in a film the sets the bar so high, is its use of sound, which very much opened my mind to the potential effects of the design of such in the movies. The film never uses music. Each scene is given seamless, faultless attention to ambient noises. In a hotel room, for instance, we hear that humming that we can never really locate. Also, there are at least two scenes where your heart is in your throat on account of the simple discerning of a transponder.In his third appearance in an incredible movie in 2007, following Grindhouse and Amerian Gangster, Josh Brolin gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. He completely embodies a sort that is very relatable and likely to do some of the questionable things that he does in the story, a shrewd pragmatist that is resourceful and invariably stubborn, intractible, and changelessly intent. He speaks few words, he's dry as desert sand, and does not think for one second about the consequences or alternate outcomes of his dangerous choices in the film. Hindsight and deliberation don't exist in his fixed and steadfast world. The chase that ensues as he sees practical possibilities as practical inevitability written in stone in taking $2 million from the site of a gruesomely fated heroin deal is to him something he must staunchly work through with a stone face.Javier Bardem, in the first film I have ever seen him in, is a presence to be reckoned with. He bears a knowing perception that telegraphs such a deeply dangerous villain. He's beyond the distance between audience and screen. He is so aware, precise, analytical, and thoughtful that he almost sees us peripherally. Pursuing the money that the narrowly engrossed Brolin has taken liberty of, he is what human beings have never faced or understood about fate. He has a mysterious philosophy that carries him serenely through a non-participating life of casual murder, perhaps that he somehow has reached an absolute certainty that there is no afterlife, that life is ultimately meaningless, and that his understanding of that existentialist conclusion admits him the privilege of controlling the fate of those he comes into contact with. How much of a match is Brolin against Bardem? The resourcefulness of the two men is transcendentally absorbingly suspenseful.Serving as the film's actual hero is perhaps Tommy Lee Jones, who plays a creaky, weathered small town sheriff who avoids the federal investigation of the incidental heroin deal to protectively pursue Brolin. His manner puts off the audience, yes. All of us who have seen this film in theaters will agree. But the key to his philosophies, idiosyncracies, and pontifications are in how he also puts off other characters. Jones, an actor who is often very deterring in how glacial and inexcitable he can be, is really the only actor I can fully and seriously imagine playing the sheriff. The beauty in the film's dooming, melancholy realism begins and ends with him, as someone who has preoccupied doubts, conscious inquiries, and learned understanding that he does not communicate. When he talks, he's saying things that make sense to his views but never his actual views. To those who he shares the screen with, as well as to us, he's an old man whose mind wanders, as he humbly admits in one scene.The three very incompatible key men never share a frame with one another, except for once very lucidly late in the film. How disconcerting, how painfully obstructing and displeasing. This is the ambiguous epitome of the film's consuming achievement. We are left wondering, pondering, and even if we don't, it lingers still. Images, lines, characters, scenes, they make our own minds wander the next day and the day after.Kelly MacDonald, the beautiful Scottish actress from Trainspotting and Gosford Park, has a authentically basic and second-class role, which a woman would in her character's place, as Brolin's wife who, despite having severe misgivings about her husband's steel-engraved plans to secure the money, she still cooperates. She is gently endearing in her performance. There is a scene where she does something that I normally can't stand in another person, which is making lip sounds. However, to my indescribable insatiability during that moment, she feels so tenderly real and pitiful and the scene takes a turn of my newfound investment in her.Despite the Coen brothers' trademark quirky character embellishments, everyone in the film is screamingly real. And that is why this film is so haunting. It may be dryly funny, off- putting, and subjective with the mindset and behavior of its West Texas characters, but it's all a part of the film's nitpicking at the frightening what-ifs of reality, of life on earth.",10,3,8,25 February 2008
District 9," First Contact Might Be Better Handled Without Aggression, as Can Be Understood by Moral Attitude, Not Policy.
","Peter Jackson has used his name to gain the widespread hype and attention needed for a film like this to succeed. That's a good thing, but the film is actually directed by Neill Blomkamp, a South African director who shows a need for a different mentor, if that is their working relationship. Blomkamp's structure shows both elegant and sardonic economy in giving us the exposition. District 9 is a self-contained, symbolic parable that sets out as a documentary made in a sci-fi universe. Oddly enough, it gradually begins to almost literally dissolve into a bullet-paced thriller, and from there an exploding bodies convention. But when it does, the story has entirely absorbed you in its backhand-slaps.The story, adapted from a short film by Blomkamp, is told by way of the sci-fi genre so that the social issues relevant to him through what he's seen so closely are dealt with from a fresh, exotic perspective. Indeed, the title itself, as well as the premise, of District 9 are apparently drawn from events in South Africa during the apartheid in Cape Town called District Six. That is all I should say, because the strongest element to the tension is the way it conceals each still developing plot point so that it all surprises us from the very beginning. I am curious as to how closely the true story and the plot of the movie resemble each other, if the real account has been degraded by the artifice, especially when the climax devolves into nonstop futuristic gunfire turning countless figures in a row into showers of gore and goop.Whatever the case may be, it is absolutely refreshing to see a sci-fi film with truly engaging concepts rather than machine wars or magical lands that have no bearing on anything whatsoever, which though they have their quality canons have been done to bland and stale excess. And the special effects, set design and various facets of practical and aesthetic details build organically from those clear concepts and serve both allegorical and perspective-shifting backstory purposes. The acting is not pat by any means, but rather ingeniously real in the case of a few particular main players. Sharlto Copley, who evidently was reluctant to take on the role, is totally and completely becoming as his neurotic, quick-on-feet character.I don't believe that most special effects-driven American audiences, including the audience with whom I saw the movie, want to think about what it's trying to say about state reliance on worldwide corporations as a means of privatized government and military. But I'm sure that they'll enjoy their fictional representatives here as evil characters they'll love to hate. I doubt they'll know or particularly care if the film refers to contemporary evictions and forced removals to new suburban ghettos in post-apartheid South Africa and the resistance of their residents. Most Americans are all but unaware of the high-profile attempted forced removal of Cape Town settlements to temporary relocation areas or evictions in the shack settlements. But I believe they'll deeply sympathize with the oppressed aliens in the film. And it is that audience reaction that will gratify those in the know, many of whom will be people, like me, who only read up after seeing the movie. And that is the most important benefit of films like this.",9,1,5,1 November 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Heroism Is In the Eye of the Beholder
","How sad and painful the story of Robert Ford is and how grimly telling it is of the shallow and insensitive nature of people as a mass. It is a western, yet it's a very patient and ominous western that plays out more like a Terence Malick film than a John Ford or Sam Peckinpah one. Westerns, by the very nature of the backdrop they set for their stories, portray primitive and unwittingly obsolete ways of life confronted modern technological or social changes. This may be depicted by showing conflict between natives and settlers, or by showing ranchers being threatened by the Industrial Revolution. American Westerns of the 1940s and 1950s emphasize honor and sacrifice. Westerns from the 1960s and 1970s have a more negative examination, lionizing a disloyal anti-hero and bringing to light the cynicism, viciousness and discrimination of the American West. The earlier westerns skim the glorious surface of the time and the later ones dig deep into the brutal nature of people in the era, but neither approach is bad. However the typical American-made western uses these elements to tell a simple morality tale that leaves room for barfights, shootouts and the salvage of helpless, entirely dependent damsels in distress. The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford exceeds this by combining the two views and creating a dark, cruel portrait of a dark, cruel time. When the movie ended, I sat staring at the screen, my thoughts entirely arrested by what I had just watched.The only aggravation of which I can think is the film's narration, which gives away subtext right as we would be absorbing it just as clearly without the narration. Sometimes the narrator is needed, sometimes it appears that the narrator baby-steps us through a scene that might be too hard for our little brains to comprehend. I still dismiss it with the wave of my hands, however, because it is there more for the purpose of setting old storyteller sort of feel of the time, and storytelling is the axis of the lives of both Jesse James and Robert Ford, and how they came to meet.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James is greatest performance, bar none. He is so chilling, not only because he can alternately appear so convincingly vulnerable and lethally menacing uninterrupted from one moment to the next, but also because he gives you the distinct worrying impression that he could truly live a life completely alone, leaving a thorough variable for the outcomes of anyone in his presence. There are many scenes with James where the most telling things he does are very difficult to script and were likely moments where the actor is given to impulse and improvisation. These happen to be some of his best scenes because Pitt renders him with a very clear and acute understanding of his careful, private, manipulative, sensitive personality. In a moment when someone lies to him, well or not well, Jesse doesn't make a very telling face. Pitt simply wears a blank, expectant expression that opens up a gash in the scene where we feel just as certainly as he does that what's just been said doesn't fit. He radiates a subsequent awkwardness to all around him, including the audience, and he somehow seems untouched by it, the only person still appearing comfortable in the room.There is an almost frighteningly natural chemistry between Casey Affleck, who plays the weak yet eager and ambitious Robert Ford, and his idol, Jesse James. His submissive yet obsessive character, hungry for attention and admiration, and James's calmly dominant and sadistic ambiguity towards him is epitomal of real, searing, almost borderline sexual connection between two people who were almost bound by fate to meet and affect each other.Sam Rockwell, one of the most lovable, natural and underused actors working right now, is always a delight to see, his trademark happy-go-lucky imperviousness creating great spark as Robert Ford's older brother Charley, who laughs along with Robert's tormentors but very slowly reveals a more concerned side when his dense mind begins to realize that it's not all fun and games.Andrew Dominik is an auspiciously promising new filmmaker whose successive efforts will hopefully equal this beautifully shot, giftedly atmospheric, all too real masterpiece, but it's difficult to fathom whether or not they could exceed it.",10,0,1,15 August 2008
Bridesmaids," A Smarter, Funnier, Ultimately Not a Whole Lot Less Petty Sex and the City
","I would say Kristen Wiig fixes a bawdy, plucky and boldly estrogen-soaked banner in the male-dominated raunch-comedy genre with this comedy from the Judd Apatow workshop that his fans have long been hoping for, were it not for that the dilemma at the center of the film is an earnest jealousy over who gets to plan a girlfriend's wedding and lose all self-control when you're not chosen to do so. It's not empowering in the way 9 to 5 or A League of Their Own are, but more like a smarter, funnier, ultimately not a whole lot less petty Sex and the City.Wiig plays a has-been cupcake entrepreneur whose bakery went bust in the downturn and whose love life comprises ad hoc sex with her obnoxiously vain bed pal, in a hilarious turn by Jon Hamm. Indeed, Bridesmaids opens with one of Wiig and Hamm's vigorous sessions in bed, an unmistakable broadcast that this is a movie that doesn't want much to do with restraint like most chick flicks. When Wiig finds that her lifetime best friend Maya Rudolph is engaged, and that Wiig herself is to be maid of honor, the new reality propels her into a cave-in of resentment, unhappiness and self-pity. But when it's revealed that Rudolph's bridal party will also involve the moneyed, statuesque, impossibly proper Rose Byrne, Wiig's anxieties filter into extravagant circumstances of uncontrollable impulses. This New Money snob is plainly a challenger for Wiig's BFF position, a rallying call Wiig confronts with a swelling succession of ill-advised efforts at one-upswomanship, each bombardment including at least a couple of cup sizes full of explosive laughs.As funny as these moments are, it's the smaller, more perceptive ones in this Apatow production that I hoped would make it worth appreciating, for director of Bridesmaids is Paul Feig, creator of Apatow's early call to arms for all his talented regulars, Freaks and Geeks, also both touching and hilarious. And indeed, an early scene here with Wiig and Rudolph, in which a chat effortlessly rolls from blowjobs to finely conveyed inside jokes, seizes the patterns and mutual implicit back story of friendship without a glitch. When Wiig meets a romantic-interest policeman named Rhodes, played expressively by Irish actor Chris O'Dowd, the sense is likewise discreet and credible. But this diverting but unfocused formula comedy, which gets this handful of qualities so spot-on, doesn't appear to grasp that it's wide of the mark for much of the remainder: It's content to indulge in graphic and humiliating inconsequentialities, and bashful about the material about which it should've been graphic and indulgent.Wiig has the unaffected beauty and self-deprecating showmanship it takes to be a star comedienne. She so deftly manages both the laughs and the more tender frowny-faced side of Bridesmaids that the movie's supporting characters often don't have the opportunity to come into their own. Paul Thomas Anderson's talented consort Rudolph is too often demoted to judgmental on-looker of Wiig's behavior.As two of Wiig's fellow dyed-to-complement entourage, Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper have virtually nothing to do, except one scene culminating in amusingly maudlin drunkenness. In fact, the one eponymous character who imperils to give Wiig a movie-stealing hustle for the envelope is the groom's husky sister Megan, played by an unvaryingly laugh-out-loud Melissa McCarthy.It's an excessively manufactured hodgepodge, attempting too many comic ideas that ultimately drown the core theme of what a modern woman needs from friendship, love and marriage. If the movie was meant to be bolder, it definitely had a apt satirical foil at its center. The issue of overindulgence, which inculcate the series of extravagant parties in the long build-up to the overstated wedding that ends the movie is left virtually ignored. Never does Bridesmaids ever try for real biting stuff. So at the same time as it feels unreasonable to carp that Bridesmaids never comes together as a cutting satire of the demeaning protocol of getting married that it portrays, the existence of other comedies in Apatow's canon, perhaps especially Feig's work, which develop their character arcs into something more complete and poignant, prevails as an gauge of Bridesmaids' lack.",7,0,2,14 October 2011
Man on the Moon," Not So Much a Celebration of Any Comic Figure as a Portrait of One's Passionate Agenda and Pursuit of It Until the End, No Matter How Strange It Was
","What is most important about the effect of this film is that it stays faithful to Andy Kaufman's intractable conception. Oh, it polishes things up slightly. Indeed, 'all the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes,' Kaufman tells us directly at the ingenious beginning, which is a brilliant tone-setter. Yet fundamentally it remains allegiant to his personage: A guy who would try you, lie to you and orchestrate laborious tricks and facades. The movie doesn't manufacture him into a tender, misread guy. And it doesn't grovel for laughs. When something is not working in Kaufman's act, it's not working in the movie, either, and it's not funny but excruciating.Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karascewski, the same writing team who penned Tim Burton's similarly visceral biopic of another obsessively off-kilter aspiring artisan, Ed Wood, this nuanced film has a monumental performance from Jim Carrey, who auspiciously vanishes within the character of Andy Kaufman. Carrey is as big a star as Hollywood has, and still rather early in Milos Forman's eighth American movie, we forget who is playing Kaufman and become enmeshed in what is happening to him. Carrey is himself an obsessive performer who will do anything to get a laugh, who wants to amuse, whose veneer is zany and saccharine. That he can extract the intricacies of Kaufman's comedic misery is quite awe- inspiring. That he can quench his own compulsion to kowtow takes a sort of maturity nobody expected out of Ace Ventura. Not only is he working without his own buffer, he's playing a guy who didn't know what that even was.The film, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, begins with Kaufman as a vexatious child in his room, declining to go out and play, preferring to host his own TV variety program for the cameras he perceived to be concealed in his bedroom walls. His material was compelled by poor nightclub and lounge acts. He understood that a live performance is seldom more intriguing than when it is going wrong.This highly creative, admirably relentless movie, which because people are stupid ended the then nearly decade-long succession of Jim Carrey movies that had very successful opening nights, follows Kaufman into the L.A. standup circuit, where a talent manager played by real- life former Kaufman co-star Danny DeVito, sees something in his act and signs him. Kaufman is soon a sitcom star, a regular on Taxi. He presses for 'guest bookings'' for his 'protege,'' a hilariously repugnant lounge act named Tony Clifton, who is played behind seamless makeup by Kaufman and sometimes by his accomplice Bob Zmuda. Kaufman steadfastly refuses to admit he is Clifton, and in a way, he isn't.",9,0,0,26 October 2009
Saving Private Ryan," A Work of Art
","In Hollywood war film tradition, epic warfare orbits on the actions of already acquainted heroes. In Steven Spielberg's judicial and exacting masterwork, thousands of horror-struck and nauseated men, most of them green to battle, are chucked into the grimace of devastating German fire. The opening sequence is as detailed as any war footage. In the blood-soaked opening steps, the landing forces and the enemy never connect eye to eye, but are just faceless clots of men who have been commanded to shoot at one another until one side is overwhelmed.Spielberg's camera makes no comprehension of the engagement. That is the function of his approach. For the individual soldier on the beach, the landing was a cacophony of clamor, sludge, gore, entrails and morbidity. The scene is filled with various nongermane fragments of chronology, as when a soldier has his arm blown off.This landing sequence is essential to form the remoteness between those who give the order that Pvt. Ryan be saved, and those who are dictated to do the saving. For Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men, the landing at Omaha has been a melting pot of crossfire. For the Army Chief in his Washington office, war feels more secluded and nationalistic. His advisors doubt the judgment and even the plausibility of a mission to save Ryan. That sets up the second act of the film, in which Miller and his men infiltrate spryly inflamed French terrain, while entertaining defiant ideas about the prudence of the assignment. All of Miller's men have served with him before, save for Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies), the translator, who speaks excellent German and French but has never fired a rifle in rage and is frightened nearly to the point of his morality's deterioration. The war was fought by civilians just like him, whose lives had not readied them for the brass tacks of combat.Steven Spielberg is often thought of as a throwaway name to refer to when speaking of the greatest directors of all time, mainly because his movies are often romanticized, Hollywood blockbusters and not hard, tough, cool grungy stuff. Spielberg, while he demonstrates a mastery of pace and story crescendo that should be taught in every film school in the world, proves with Saving Private Ryan, not to mention with the more recent Munich, that he is capable of true grit and shocking realism.The story begins with the most gut-wrenchingly violent battle scene I've seen in any war film. This prolonged sequence depicts D-Day in the most realistic possible way, not only with gore and violence but also with the ambient violence that must be dealt with in moments of hasty contemplation and desperate but emotionally diluted dialogue. The film then segues into a story that applies the deeply affecting theme of the mother. What makes the film so profound is its core drawing of sympathy from the audience for the common boy's mother and the pain and worry they endure in times of war that we can only imagine.His cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who also shot Schindler's List, brings a newsreel texture to a lot of the footage, but that's rather elementary next to his most substantial stroke, which is to make everything manifest lucid. Following the meticulous pandemonium of the landing scenes, Kaminski handles the attack on the machine gun nest, and an extensive climax concerning the fortification of a bridge, in a way that keeps us aligned. It's not simply men shooting at one another. We learn the plan of the action, the subtle victory of optimism over despair, the spontaneity, the corresponding locations of the soldiers.Hanks has a subtle sense of drama in his personal commitment to the role of Capt. Miller, an English teacher who has outlived ordeals so overwhelming that he doubts if his wife will even place him. With a reserved, collected, and even exacting bearing, his hands nonetheless quiver. He is on the verge of breakdown, but he does his best since that is his duty. All of the actors, all the countless noteworthy faces, playing the men under him are compelling, somewhat on account of Spielberg defying the inducement to make them stereotypical caricatures in the custom of WWII movies, and makes them emphatically everyday.Everything approaches the third act, when Private Ryan is found, and the soldiers determine what to do next. Spielberg and his screenwriter, Robert Rodat, have done a penetrating and personally transcendent thing: They have made a philosophical film about war in effect thoroughly in circumstances of action. Their sweeping ode says things about war that are as intricate and demanding as any essayist could likely assert, and does it with expansive, forceful imagery, with brutality, with coarseness, with movement, with rapport. It is conceivable to get across even the most sensitive notions in the most elementary words and actions, and that's what Spielberg does with keen instincts, because he signifies his impressions in visceral reactions, not words. Steven Spielberg is as technically accomplished as any filmmaker alive, and due to his mammoth eminence, he has admittance to any asset he entails. Both of those facts are relevant to the punch of this seamless period piece. He knows how to express his emotional fervor about men in combat with utmost moralistic intensity, and he has the apparatus, the greenback and the running dogs to make it happen.",10,2,5,31 October 2006
28 Days Later...," Above-Average and Character-Driven
","I'm going to start off with my pettiest criticism so that you'll forget how cheap I am by the time you're finished reading: This movie starts off by establishing that animal rights activists are at fault for spreading the 'rage' virus because they set lab animals free from their cages, only to find out too late that they've been turned into foaming, savage predators. I'm not saying that Alex Garland, the screenwriter, vilified animal rights activists on purpose, but isn't that the overall effect of the scene? That they're ignorant, malevolent anarchists who don't know what they're doing and cause massive destruction? I find that highly contemptible. But the rest of the film is fine.I remember when this film was released it was a breakthrough for both Cillian Murphy and the use of grainy, gritty digital video cinematography in mainstream movies. By now, we've already been introduced to the latter. When the former awakens in an empty hospital and leaves, he finds a forsaken London. In a sequence of astounding shots, he wanders with not a single person within reach, seeing from old wind-beaten newspapers of a virus that twisted human beings against itself.So opens this character-driven take on the post-apocalyptic horror movie, which starts as an above-average horror film and continues as an stimulating, however action-packed, inquiry of human nature (and yes, only human. In spite of the fact that this spread from chimps, there don't seem to be any animals that attack or are attacked by the rage-infected).Though famously indecisive regarding how to end this movie, director Danny Boyle, who by this time had made the enduring contemporary landmark Trainspotting, gives his sci-fi drama an abrupt documentary impression, making the film scarier through being more realistic, while at the same time making the movie less expensive. It makes you wonder about the formula credibility of movies like this: A more expensive film would have had more traditional action heroes, and less screen time in what would be a less patient stride to expand the gradually familial relationship between the unusual characters, each of them being everyday people transformed by inescapable circumstance. Throw enough money into this movie's broad concept, and it would have the penetration of the Resident Evil films or the Dawn of the Dead remake. Garland's script develops characters who seem to have a reality at a distance from their part in the plot, whose behavior determines what they do, where they go, and why.Naomie Harris's seemingly inscrutable, at first less than approachable black female becomes the bossy member of the intimate cluster, wearing the toughest and least emotional shell, imposing a hardened survivalist boundary. Timid Cillian Murphy would probably have died if he hadn't met her. Sooner or later they find solace with two other survivors: Brendan Gleeson's genial and resourceful father and his teenage daughter Hannah, of whom he is strongly protective. They've overwhelmingly fortified in a high-rise apartment, and use their hand-cranked radio to receive a broadcast from an Army unit near Manchester. Should they count on the broadcast and journey to what is illustrated as a safe haven? After some debate, the group, who seems to bond more and more every minute, resolves that the smartest thing to do is to take the chance.In a lesser film, and almost certainly an American one, there would be a sex scene between Murphy and Harris, but Boyle and Garland's work finds the fitting pitch in an instant where she pecks him on the cheek, and he's the one that blushes.The rage-infecteds bring up questions like, How long can one live once infected? Since London seems empty at the beginning, I assume the infecteds we see were survivors until somewhat lately. Another thought: Seeing as they run in hordes, why don't they attack one another? Its driving strand of the zombie-like outbreak seems allegorical, the film punctuates its assertion of a human's most rudimentary self in the climactic scene, which fulfills every ounce of pent-up aggression in you, the viewer, and though the third act does not quite live up to the promise of the first two, this climactic bloodbath is the highest point of the film.",8,3,4,28 October 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Ah, the Good Old Days
","There is something about a Hollywood blockbuster entertainment with Spielberg at the helm. The script is never quite as ridiculous, the effects are never quite as deflecting, the acting never quite as phoned in as, say, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay picture. This intense sequel, an inimitable essence of the 1990s, is the sort of movie that pure entertainments once were, and that is the sort of escape, release, leisure every so often. The film's star is one of the most lovable actors in the world, the wry and able full-time comic charmer Jeff Goldblum, who is a clear indication of the movie's era, which, believe it or not, has passed us by already.Perhaps it's more satisfying for me to watch a blockbuster from my childhood rather than those that are being released today. Yet, I don't suspect it's entirely the nostalgia, because the movie seemed no more or less pleasing now than when I saw it at age nine, a larger- than-life gorefest of magnificent, painful suspense in a packed theater with my cringing mother. It could also be that the tiresome blockbusters in more recent years are perhaps recycled goods that, while they grow with the developing technology, refuse to grow with audience's experience with such similar stories and dying ingenuity. Spielberg's stop- motion, ridiculous corny dialogue back when it wasn't yet so corny and wasn't yet quite so riddled with cheap gratuity, and bygone use of a memorable orchestral score are the true welcome escapes.Moreover, the Jurassic Park films, The Lost World being by far the most fulfilling one, demonstrate a significant implication that may hopefully be heeded by the youngsters who routinely go through phases with the giant Hollywood franchises such as this, one of letting nature run its course gracefully, to leave nature be, to recognize the harm, vanity, infection, and especially the danger in exploiting it and forcing it out of its biological process. This is something Michael Bay has not, will not, and does not want to do. Yet it's something that Steven Spielberg has always done, planting good-natured seeds in the young generations throughout which he's made an impact.",10,1,1,18 August 2008
City of God," More Movies Should Be Like This One
","City of God was made to be remembered, it was made to rivet its audience with every frame, it was made to evoke all emotions, and it was made to be an epic. It succeeds in all of these areas, because it avoids any point where there could be a dull moment. Most films allow gaps in pace with the confidence that they can be made up for with other fantastic points. City of God has you so wound up in it that it leaves you wanting more.It's made in the vein of Scorsese's crime dramas, with lots of jump-cutting, a jukebox soundtrack, flashy camera and editing styles, wildly entertaining yet ardently realistic violence, and a large amount of characters that are all strangely balanced, some fading in and out and showing up at surprising times when we've forgotten all about them, some driving the story. The film was revered by scores of critics, but also panned by many of them, surprisingly, for its tinsel style and flashy visuals. I say that it's ridiculous to look down your nose at such a grandiose and spectacular film such as City of God for what is the focal point of the art of film. Films are initially something to look at. They're designed for you like what you see.City of God is not only one of the finest films to come out recently. It's a milestone. More movies should be made with the same ambitions and goals from their makers as this one. Then, maybe we'd have some better ones out of Hollywood.",10,1,3,18 October 2006
Drive," Get Ready to Be Played Like a Piano. And Pounded Like One, Too.
","The first time we see the Driver, he's the wheelman for a getaway car, who evades police pursuit not simply with speed and force but by taking calm advantage of the street landscape and outmaneuvering his chasers. Its up there with some of the best car chases I've ever seen. By day, he's a stunt driver for action movies. The two jobs are no contradiction for him: He drives. As played by Ryan Gosling, he's in the convention of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name and Alain Delon's Jef Costello. No family, no past and ostensibly few feelings. He's an existential hero, It would seem, characterized completely by his actions.That would meet the criteria for the hero of a tedious action movie, but Drive is an utterly graceful implementation of style, and its feelings may be submerged but they resonate intensely. The mystery of Gosling's wheelman is surrounded by a fertile balcony of tangential actors who are clear about their plans and suspicions, and who have either reached an understanding with the Driver, or not, yet another example of the old Hollywood noir tenet that a movie breathes not merely through its hero, but from its shadows.The Driver actually lives somewhere. Somehow that seems amazing. Played by Carey Mulligan, his neighbor is a model for defenselessness. She has a young son, Benicio, who appears to motivate warmth in the Driver, though he isn't a demonstrative sort. They become friendly, but soon, her husband Standard is sprung from prison. Counter to our almost certain expectations, Standard isn't resentful or antagonistic toward the new friend, but evaluates him, sees someone formidable, and find they can help each other. That will supply the locomotive for the story, and as Irene and Benicio are threatened, the Driver unravels intense feelings and allegiances, and suffers massive peril at little real advantage to himself.The film is populated with characters who bring volumes to the screen, counter to the Driver, who brings nothing but pure presence. Ron Perlman looks to be a major operator working out of the petty frontage of a strip mall pizzeria. Albert Brooks, every bit as formidable as you'd never expect, plays a producer of the sorts of B movies the Driver drives stunt for, one of his business ventures as a powerful local mobster. These people are cold-blooded. More benevolent is the great Bryan Cranston, as the sort of guy the Driver has to have backing him, a whiz at car repairs, and supercharging.Drive appears to have little CGI. Most of the stunt driving seems authentic, with cars of mass and heaviness, instead of ridiculous animated fantasies. The whole movie, actually, is incomparably more genuine than the typical action-crime-chase fabrications we've become bored with. Here's a movie with deference to writing, acting, technique and well-informed moviegoers. The crucial feeling you want to experience during a chase sequence is participation in its intent. You have to worry. Almost always nowadays, we're just watching fast machinery.Ryan Gosling is a magnetic actor, a modest one. He exemplifies aura and unaffectedness. For as long as we've been seeing him in movies, he's demonstrated a knack for discovering striking, commanding characters. An actor who can make us believe he's become smitten by an anatomically correct doll can realize practically anything. Drive looks like one kind of movie in the ads, and it is that kind of movie, but also a rebuke to most of the movies it looks like.",9,3,8,28 October 2011
The Lives of Others," Praise
","What an auspicious, overwhelmingly impressive directorial debut this film is. It's difficult to think of any American director, even our finest, who made a true milestone during their first time in the director's chair. The Lives of Others is seamless. The pace of the film is intense, steady, fixated, allowing smaller things, technical situations, difficult to imagine on film, to become riveting moments integrated into the film as a whole. The drama of the movie's story is sternly realized with an almost cold perspective that allows realism that is impartial, though the film's stance is very obvious and clear. The historical detail of the look and feel of East Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall in the 1980s is very bleak and clearly portrayed as such by the impeccable camera. According to a friend who saw this movie with me, who was studying abroad at one point in East Berlin during the time it takes place, the realization of setting and time period is perfectly realistic.Something about the film that I am personally drawn to is the involvement in the subject matter of intricate plots, intrigue, elaborate schemes, and overall sneakiness, all of which are present in very fulfilling form and perfectly organized within the plot, which still allows great emotion and cinematic voice.Ulrich Muhe, an actor I've seen in a few of Michael Haneke's films, may seem to many American viewers to be overly stoic and hardly dramatic, but his portrayal of an externally cold, stand-offish introvert of very few words is brilliant. His performance is actually quite a dramatic challenge. The self-control required to play the role with the gradual intensity that he does is a joy to watch, as are the performances of varying degrees of animation, tone, and persona by the rest of the cast, mainly Gedeck, Koch, Tukur, and Thieme.The Lives of Others is possibly the greatest German film I've seen so far in my life. It is wonderful, surely even for those who aren't familiar with the political matter of the story.",10,4,6,27 March 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Now This Is Where I Get Kind of Negative
","I treated my first viewing of the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. If a movie hits it big, I feel obligated to see it, because people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen Lord of the Rings. Before the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I said that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones with extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, extremely late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.I wrote in my review way back when I re-watched this film's predecessor, 'Despite having never read a syllable of any of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, I was perfectly able to appreciate Jackson's passionate adaptation. It is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. No, I am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. You know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. And no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. However, these components come with the territory, and I can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign.' I should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately I did not. The same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when I first saw the first film.The dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. I could not get past them this time around. I simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that I've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. For instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying 'didn't' or 'can't.' This is a small example. When things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, I only begin to wonder why they speak this way. Why do some characters speak in variations of English accents and others speak in American ones? Is this a question answered in the books? Perhaps I should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so I figured I would be fine. Does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? An adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. But, for the sake of the film's logic, I hope that there is reason given in the books for Middle Earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. The biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way I've spoken of but haven't yet explained. You know what they do: They begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. And the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. I could go on and on, but in the interest of time, I'll move on.The battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. There was no intensity. The camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. The dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. As I watch, I see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. I felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed.What I liked about this film was the plot strand involving Gollum, Frodo, and Sam. I felt compassion for Gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. I also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. Just as I did in the first movie, I love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and I love the Gothic and extravagant use of lighting. During the climax, even though I was disappointed in how unriveted I was in the battle, I enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together.I gave this movie every chance when my natural proclivities were against it. I was assuredly paying attention, which didn't help me: Once Faramir's party reaches Anduin, one of Gondor's people says Mordor's seized the eastern side. So how do they get to the western side? If they use the sewer that Faramir later sends Frodo and Sam into, why did he explain to them what those sewers were? They'd have seen them already, just like me, who doesn't have to see this movie anymore. And for that I'm thankful. I didn't dislike this film, but I would add The Fellowship of the Ring to my collection and refuse to allow this sequel. I simply don't think I could watch it again. I hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be.",6,0,1,22 March 2007
Schindler's List," One of the All-Time Quintessential American Films
","Steven Spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen Schindler's List, one of the all-time quintessential American films. Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.Oskar Schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the Holocaust. Schindler is a crass businessman from Czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of Jews to manufacture for the German military. He is a coldly opportunistic member of the Nazi Party, smothering the army with bribes as well as SS officials in charge. Funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. Not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley in his best performance next to Sexy Beast, a functionary in the local Jewish Council who has contacts with the now underground Jewish business community in the Ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. Schindler makes the Nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while Stern actually does the handling of the organization. When Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less, this means that the Jews themselves get nothing. Their wages go to the Reich. Schindler's Jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and Stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps.Schindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. He's doing it because of the financial benefits. His realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. It is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. It is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. There are many scenes even aside from the Krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. Truly the most unforgettable performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, playing SS official Gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense.",10,30,51,5 August 2008
Across the Universe," The Perfect Incarnation of a Song, a Testament of Love Surviving So Much
","Because this film lingered in my mind because of its brandished originality and progressive contribution to the movie-going experience, I looked through a little bit of history behind the subject matter. As nearly everyone aware of this film knows, it's a musical with a story outlined and directed by a selection of Beatles songs, one of them sharing a title with the movie. In the song, there is a lyric that expresses an overbearing accost of creativity and ideas, 'words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup.' It came to Lennon after the minuscule matter of hearing his wife talking up a storm. That night, he kept hearing those words over and over and took advantage of the indefinite streak of thought, developing it into something of a song. When he was done, he apparently went to bed and forgot about them and in the morning, he found them and brought them to his piano, where he began to play chords, and find pitches to match the words.This process can be assumed about the way in which this film was made, as its style, spirit, and flow all suggest. The perfect incarnation of a song, an idea very tough to execute but intensely, brilliantly, enthusiastically, very imaginatively, and boldly so by Taymor, and as anarchically as the studio's PG-13 limitations would allow her to. The idea of the premise is something that is hard to imagine sitting down and brainstorming out and rather something that accosts you at any given time, convenient or not, and you can only record what has spilled from your mind at that given moment. The film executes the concept by finding themes, subject, and feelings that match the skeleton that is the outline of all of the songs. One of the most telling keys to the aforementioned is how the story opens with the allegory of an Englishman coming to the US, then proceeding to affect and inspire the lives of a diverse range of Americans he comes into contact with.Perhaps my favorite part of the film is the Hey Jude sequence. To me, what is portrayed is all that that wonderfully uplifting and energizing song can be about, and consequently a imaginative personification of how it can make you feel.The film's story, revolving around the arching transformations of our culture throughout the 1960s seen with the focus upon a group of people who become affiliated with each other and drift in and out of each other's lives like the tempests and flights of fancy that were very much what the Beatles' music was for people's lives in that era, which is the central reason why Taymor's vision is so wonderfully ablaze with the true meaning of the word 'brilliant.' Not just because the premise sounds unfamiliar compared to what we normally see. To me, a director like her is yearned for in the cinema when it comes to giving tangibly emotional identity to feelings and meanings that are hardly thought to be possible to express in movies. Aside from the uniqueness in the importance of the film's axis concept, an important example is the character of Prudence being depressed because of the impulsive heterosexual attractions of Lucy, played by the stunning Evan Rachel Wood, and Jude, played by the potential rather than kinetic energy of Jim Sturgess, and of Sadie (Fuchs) and Jojo (McCoy) and how much more complicated her own sexuality is and how difficult it is to express it even in a time of such sexual freedom and change, and how painful that must be. It's a small part of the story, just like it was a small part of one's attention during that era.This film goes with its own flow with absolutely no regard for a judgmental view, thus you are forced to go with the flow, take its chances, and accept its rambling taking of license. I admire any film that does so.",8,5,11,18 January 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," A Definite Masterpiece
","What transfixes me throughout every scene of this sinewy, offbeat film is the extraordinarily pragmatic realism of the hurtles Sonny and Sal confront inside the bank. Not even twenty minutes into the film, we find we're already seeing things absolutely no other crime film has ever included that are astonishing in their dramatic persuasiveness. The head teller and the bank manager picking apart Sonny's plan with him. One clerk's husband calls and asks what time the robbers will be through so he knows if he has to cook for himself or not. While ordering the bank manager to help him block the back entrance by moving a big desk, Sonny asks offhand why he'd hire a diabetic as a guard, and is told in ordinary person-to-person terms what a guard's salary is and why poor old Howard has that job.And when does Mulvaney the bank manager, played by captivating unknown character actor Sully Boyar, tell hostage-taker he'd like to see his family again but if someone must be taken, take him? When he's helping his captor move a big desk to block the back. They sound like regular working urbanites so caught up in the daily grind of city life that they might as well be making small talk in an elevator. Later, the phone rings, Sonny picks up, it's a sicko telling him to kill 'em all. Sonny hangs up after four seconds, moving on. The female tellers sit and sweat while giggling about the same silly things---'He said the f-word.' 'Well, I'm a Christian and my ears are not garbage cans.'---in the thick of a hostage situation and a media circus. Poignant, real.Every nuance of Pacino's performance is incredibly realistic. He practically possesses the audience, as we can begin to expect certain things from him and care about him because he's played by an actor who completely subsists as him. At points when characters speak of him off-screen, speaking of things that we are surprised to hear about him, that take us aback and color his image, Pacino has prepared the size for those turning points to fit in. His improvised scenes are exceptional as well, and are in fact some of the most riveting, nail-bitingly intense scenes in the entire film. In such scenes, he is matched by the great actor Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon's becoming fulfillment of his role.Indeed, this is by far Durning's most riveting performance. He works so well here because in shouting matches with Sonny, he looks and sounds entirely his age, not a movie character. He's fat, middle-aged, tired, just as surprised as everybody else. He runs short of breath, trying desperately to keep up with the pressure cooking higher all around him. As Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti, Durning epitomizes the thankless job of a police officer more candidly and perfectly than any other movie cop I've ever seen. One of this stunning succession of brilliant scenes is the first time Sonny emerges to talk face-to-face with Moretti in the street, which begins with a protracted pin-drop silence and slowly, steadily, invisibly culminates in deafening, ear-splitting chaos.Lumet opens the film with a montage of city scenes in NYC with a good getting-up-in-the- morning song like Elton John's Amoreena and with the same indifference ends up on Sonny, Sal and their friend waiting outside a bank in a car, an image that just happens to continue. This is a great way to demonstrate the it-could-happen-anywhereness. Lumet's overall direction of the film is beautiful, indicative once again of the masterful mainstay of cinema in the 1970s. The climactic final ten minutes are ruthless in their steadily unraveling, almost unbearably intense tragedy. It's not only one of the most effective uses of sound to create drama I've ever seen, but everything concludes exactly as it would in reality.",10,25,31,2 October 2007
Kick-Ass," The Starting Pitcher of Young Guy Movies in 2010
","Watching Kick-Ass, we realize other films are working at one quarter speed. We've seen so many superhero movies. Especially after the Dark Knight watershed, Hollywood's as crazed in its search for comic-book options as Dobbs was in his search for gold in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. We feel we're familiar with all the angles on the genre, but then comes this movie, itself a comic book adaptation, about several superheroes, that, very simply, does it better. It's fresh. It doesn't spoof or satirize; it just plays an original tune with all the same notes. It's directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie's hyperkinetic thug films, but directed Layer Cake. So we wonder, who was learning from who? Kick-Ass tells the basic story of the Ordinary Teenager, who wonders why nobody's ever decided to become a superhero like the ones in his comics. The reasons are obvious, but when you're one of those invisible kids in high school, your big pipe dreams begin to be your plot to prove yourself. So he decides to become a real-life superhero himself, despite having no powers or training in the least. The movie does not shy away from realistic ramifications of fantastical encounters, and during his first attempt to fight crime by trying to stop a carjacking by two local thugs, he's indeed beaten, stabbed, and even hit by a car. He's hospitalized, convinces medics to say nothing of his costume, to say he was brought in naked. But now some of his nerve endings are damaged, giving him a slightly enhanced capacity to endure pain, metal plates have been placed in his skeleton to sustain his bones.The assigned villains of the story are big-city Mafiosi, led by Mark Strong, returning to the role he unreservedly plays best, the tough, dominant boss who doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is his son, who gets his own drivers, bodyguards, respect. Mintz-Plasse is the rare character actor iho's so naturally funny that the first time we see him, I started to laugh, even though he's not doing anything really. There's just something about his look and manner; he's like Woody Allen for our generation. He becomes Red Mist, Kick-Ass's ridiculous yet cunning costumed nemesis.The charm of this movie is the interweaving of so many rich superhero characters into a fast-moving but expansive plot with a cheerfully tasteless sense of cruel humor. I'm of course speaking mainly of the father-daughter crime-fighting team of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. We're introduced to them when he promises to reward her with ice cream after a training session involving shooting her point-blank while wearing a bulletproof vest. She masters the martial arts possibly more than any movie fighter of any age I can recall. She's particularly skilled with lethal knife-throwing, and is rewarded a foot-long knife by Dad somewhat like a samurai is rewarded a special sword by his sensei. She fearlessly confronts a hallway filled with gun-sporting gangsters, shoots, stabs and beats them all to death. The movie's not taking the easy way out: They don't wail on the floor; she brutally takes their lives, apparently experiencing no emotions about it. She uses heavyweight profanity like a Guy Ritchie thug, and is the toughest, most effective character in the whole story. This is ballsy, fresh and reactionary comedy.Outside of the superhero and mob characters, all of whom are richly and colorfully defined, the movie is nevertheless just as guilty as the next mainstream movie of not having any clue how to portray high school kids. I'm told that in Mark Millar's original comic, the girl of Kick-Ass's dreams goes from uninterested to appalled when he reveals his secret identity. That'd perfectly befit the film's disregard for the easy way out, which allows it to be so fresh and intriguing. But Hollywood won't have it, as in the most unreasonably stupid scene, he breaks into her room, explains his deceptions and in a completely implausible turn they begin having passionate dirty sex. However, where this would normally sever a movie from my engrossment, this one's working at such a vigorous frequency that I remained interested in its explosive set pieces and ink-black humor.Perhaps it only seems smarter than it is: There's a scene where Vaughn confidently demonstrates a knowledge of what the audience already knows, where Strong, and we, see Kick-Ass walking down the street from behind, he follows him, eagerly attacks him, all of which occurs without ever giving us exactly what we suspect, but what's more admirable even then is how Vaughn never found it necessary to show the face of the phony Kick-Ass; he knows we know it's not actually him. However, it's never elucidated how they find out later that the Kick-Ass imposter who they attacked was only an imitator and not the actual Kick-Ass. If nobody's aware of who Kick-Ass really is up to that point, how do they know the imposter wasn't the actual Kick-Ass? Well, at any rate, it's difficult not to have fun at this movie.",8,3,7,16 July 2010
Gran Torino," A Character Study of a Grumpy Old Conservative Man
","Eastwood plays the lead as a man blasting with intensity, most of which he uses to the advantage of the macho notion to contain his feelings. Each word, each literal growl, seems to have escaped from submergence like steam. Archie Bunker expansion Walt Kowalski, a retired and widowed Polish American auto assembly worker and a Korean War vet, lives in a changing craftsman-style Michigan neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants.It's a character study I've been waiting to see, a study of the old Conservative man. Walt is the classic model. His intolerance of ambiguity or uncertainty, lack of openness to experience, need for simple resolutions and personal structure, and his feeling threatened by the idea of losing status or self-assurance are all established in the first half hour. He has no tolerance for his two sons and their families. He sees them as indulgent and self-involved, sidestepping him except if it's not somehow to their advantage. His sons see him as always unsatisfied with them. I saw them as quite normal, only reacting to his bitterness. Really, he is remarkably judgmental. Immediately after seeing the film, I thought it a flaw that Walt's only sign of racism was a quota the screenwriters filled for derogatory terms: Gook, zipperhead, swamprat, dego, spook, mick. My favorite is Dragon Lady, but other than that, no vital signs. But looking at him as a whole, he's not so much a racist as a guard, defending his own security. He sits on his porch protecting the doctrine that your right to life ends when you're on his lawn.He sees a carload of Hmong gangstas try to push the shy, bookish Thao into their troublemaking. When they coerce Thao to try to steal Walt's cherished Gran Torino, Walt comes a lightbulb flicker away from blowing his brains out. Then Thao's likable and intuitive sister Sue comes to apologize for her family and offer Thao's household services and Walt unwillingly agrees. When Sue is intimidated by some black punks, Walt's gaze tightens focus and he gets involved because it is his way.The idea of a 78-year-old action hero initially sounded to the studios similar to how it sounds to the common film-goer, but Eastwood has spent over forty years making it his trademark. The film is an action movie in more of an internal sense than external. Eastwood's harshness is as much said as shown. Even at 78, he can make 'Get off my lawn' a formidable annex to 'Make my day' and 'Do you feel lucky, punk,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he is quite convincing.Sooner or later, his life becomes awkwardly close to these people. Walt makes no apologies for who he is, and that's why, when he begins to feel protective of his neighbors over his own family, it determines meaning. Eastwood's potent requiem isn't a liberal fable, as oddly opposed to fifty-plus-year Republican Eastwood's previous, and superior, film Changeling.This, apparently the highest grossing film of Eastwood's entire career, is about the overdue evolution of a man's finer essence, and about the power of integration. This isn't a noble metamorphosis as it would've been if Walt were a bona fide bigot. It's a movie geared toward generations close to Walt's, which is admirable. There aren't many bankable directors or stars as old as Clint who brave the themes perspective of those who share his era and old-school outlook. Yes, the final unraveling into the end credits feels too blanket and sleepwalked, happening a little too hastily, but Walt's epoch likes it that way.",7,0,4,22 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," War Is All-Consuming.
","There is not much about The Hurt Locker that hasn't already been said by nearly unanimous critics and audiences, but being such a feverishly subjective experience, one is bound to have brought one's own relative fears, perceptions and sense of both surprise and inevitability to the experience oneself. Regardless of where those reactions individually come from and the relationship they have with a given scene, that in itself is the experience of the soldier in combat. The actors on screen do not work from prose monologues but through instinctive reckonings of who they are and what they feel. They are not good fighting evil. They see less good and more evil in everyone and everything with each passing day.Kathryn Bigelow has always been a very skillful director of Hollywood action movies. But this is a whole different beast. She has certainly put her hand to varying themes, settings and subgenres before, but The Hurt Locker is in a class all by itself as the film where she has focused every fiber of her ability into fashioning a unique, unfettered film. Yes, an uber-masculine action film, a film about the Iraq War, but rarely are we so unaware of the distance between ourselves and the screen. It is not just the only film about the war to have been successful thus far, it is an experience she has fought tooth and nail to give us.There are two name actors in the film. One of them dies in the very first scene and the other appears for a minute or less near the end. Otherwise, we spend the film's protracted duration in the unadulterated presence of actors we may or may not have seen before, unable to comfort ourselves by connecting them with other roles in other films. There are no masks of stardom any more than there are facades of set design or non-diagetic visual effects. We inevitably believe that they are not acting at all, that they are living the very lives and doing the very things on screen.The film was shot by United 93 cinematographer Barry Ackroyd with hand-held 16mm cameras, usually with four cameras rolling at once. It is gritty, grimy, saturated in sweat, overexposure, underexposure, and the expansion beyond dualism. This is the way we believe the bomb squad's experiences look and feel, because that is the way we undergo our physical day-to-day existence, by looking at the small, representative systems and the entire complex structure at the same time. The eye always has and always will see conflictingly with the lens, though with various focal lengths and an energetic editing approach---indeed you are guaranteed to never feel aware of a cut---the lens gives us that mutual negotiation of opposing perspectives, which inescapably embodies the sense of complete involvement.It isn't just the self-contained plays depicting the three conflicting sergeants in the bomb unit diffusing improvised explosives that have our hearts in our throats. The building rage and paranoia pervades every moment. One night, the three sergeants, played by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, who never completely like or hate each other, get more wasted than anybody I've ever seen and take turns smashing each other in the stomach. But this is not quite aggressive enough to satisfy one of them, Renner's Sergeant First Class William James, who lives and breathes confrontation with potentially fatal threats the way a drug addict is never satisfied with more than enough of their substance. He is not bad or cruel. He is not easily offended, he is gregarious and honest. But he is like that in the field as well, such as when he insists on approaching a suspected bomb without first sending a bomb disposal robot on his first mission with this company.Bigelow will never be the same filmmaker she was before. Near Dark, Blue Steel and Strange Days are exciting thrillers, and they demonstrate her flair for atmosphere, but at the helm of The Hurt Locker, she demonstrates an outright mastery and total understanding of the effects of the camera, the mental creation of the third shot when one shot cuts to the next, and the most unequivocally honest application of life's sights and sounds to those of cinema. She has the brass balls to take a subject matter proved to be box office poison and give it her relentless all.",8,2,11,4 October 2009
La Grande Illusion," 'French or German, duty is duty. I would've done the same.'
","Jean Renoir's 1937 time capsule of poetic realism is all about tone, a tone of longing and cynicism. It has a heightened aestheticism, but one that doesn't draw consciousness to the representational aspects of the film. Long, fluid takes counterpoint the mood with a brisk pace. A bored restlessness. This film is a lot of things. It's riddled with symbolism, it has no interest in the war going on outside the walls of its POW camp setting and it captures a great feeling of male bonding and camaraderie. It's as if they're boys and the camp is a new school to them. Everyone alike complains about the food, the cold, the smells, what have you. Enemies are only enemies because it makes sense politically, not on personal level. 'It's good to see you again, gentlemen,' Joseph Von Stroheim says. 'I'm sorry it had to be here.' Even the planning of escape is patient and leisurely.Their easygoing attitude is in part disillusionment. They see the sternness of the neighboring boot camp: 'Those children acting like soldiers. In here, the soldiers act like children.' Dry, sometimes silly humor complements the attitude. When a German officer tries to cheer up an exasperated Jean Gabin in solitary confinement, it feels like the scene in Animal House when John Belushi tries to cheer up Flounder by crushing a beer can on his head. The central drive of the story, a plan to escape, seems to be out of a sort of rebellion against boredom. As one German says, 'The war's too long.'When I first saw this film at a screening at the Taft Museum, I loved it but I felt the ending ruined it. It felt tacked on, unnecessary. But now, seeing the film again, I've changed my mind. The farm woman is a widow, they're fugitives. Hey, lonely is lonely. She and her daughter are naive, the POWs are disenchanted. They refresh each other.In this humanistic war drama, there is more frustration between classes than the sides of WWI. Everyone learns to give and take, without betraying who they are personally, without denying differences of culture and class. 'Playing patience? Yes. I'm a realist,' says one aristocratic character as he and the other prisoners hydrate themselves with small dreams, digging a tunnel by night, dressing up in drag to awaken their memories of womanhood, commemorating the smallest and most tentative of defeats to the enemy as news dribbles in from the front, or von Stroheim's sensitive care of a geranium in his fortress bedroom. I love Von Stroheim, his extreme Germanness and how he uses his character's injured spine to complement it. It's one of the many nuances that complements the paring down of all the characters' views of life. The grand illusion is nationality. It's man-made, and so are borders.",9,1,1,22 February 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not So Much an Emotional Experience As It Is a Tremendously Impressive Technical Achievement
","Following the procedural but audacious Zodiac, this film shows Fincher on his own reverse-evolutionary course. The story opens with a man who has suffered the loss of a loved one, putting his talent to creative and profound use in a way that wishes for those who we've lost to return. And then we see the concept of his work put into practice, and though there are miraculous aspects, elements and moments in the unique subject's life, it has the same well of tragedy, heartbreak and loneliness, just different kinds, making them harder. And we see that no matter who one is, life is defined by its tragedies.In spite of this, I never shed a single tear, never felt my heart sink. David Fincher's questionable epic, really his first non-thriller, to me, is not so much an emotional experience as it is a tremendously impressive technical achievement. There is not a single frame that could have been better shot or edited. Atmospherically, it is a masterpiece. In the creativity of envisioning the character of Benjamin Button throughout all of the stages of his life, it is a masterpiece. But that is essentially the aim of the film, rather than having you leave it with one of many life-affirming cathartic experience under your belt.It deliberately spreads its scope wider than necessary. We begin by seeing the elderly Daisy, a barely recognizable Cate Blanchett, on her deathbed with her daughter in a New Orleans hospital as Katrina approaches. Daisy then narrates perhaps the most incredible sequence of the entire film, of a blind clockmaker played by Elias Koteas, who was contracted to construct a clock to hang in the New Orleans train station. Subsequent to the news of his son's death in The Great War, he sustained an even deeper occupation with his clock, which he deliberately conceived to run in reverse, perhaps to artistically honor the grief of mourning parents of soldiers, or with the dream that it actually would bring back those who died in the war.Back to Daisy. She asks Caroline to read aloud from a diary containing photographs and postcards written by Benjamin Button. Caroline begins to read as the story transitions to Benjamin's point of view. For a film with such a transcendental concept, and one with such import, this narrative format is quite stale. If only it could've simply told the story without the stretched scale and let us be Caroline, let us react the way she does, rather than detaching us to watch Caroline dramatize the emotional worth for us. Brad Pitt, in the virtually monolithic title role, goes through many changes but at a few of them looks very much like himself and at some points even younger. I don't know what my Kinsey rating is, but he simply is one arrestingly beautiful man.At any rate, we go into a movie or a book with the supposition that it will tell a story in sequential time. We understand and discern flashbacks and flash-forwards, even when the signals are very subtle. If a story moves in reverse, its scenes indicate a chronological progression seen backwards. Even if a scene recurs, it has its place in chronology. If time is splintered into diverging avenues, it is about how the characters try to have power over their existence. Even 21 Grams, The Time Machine, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, et. Al. require the inescapable command of time.There was another film in 2008 that isn't nominated for Best Picture or anything secondary or tertiary in importance, or listed among the favorites of the year at all, and it's an admirably extreme contemplation of the procedure of existing and getting older. But people en masse need time for it to grow on them. Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York will be beheld and treasured in time.",6,1,2,19 January 2009
Children of Men," One of the Most Beautifully Made Films of Our Time
","The lush yet bleak ambiance of the film is created by the absolutely astonishing cinematography. Every setting is given such character by the attachment the camera has to the film's people. There is a profound quality in the scenes of hand-held camera-work, and also a beauty in perspective during its long shots. There is even a scene, a spectacularly different and uniquely suspenseful chase, that is filmed during the process of night to dawn to daylight, something that I have surely not seen before in a movie. The cinematography of Emmanuelle Lubezki, which is also what walks away with most films to his credit, such as The New World and Sleepy Hollow, is a reestablishment of true visual artistry in the movies. Cuaron's masterful and unHollywoodlike pacing magnifies the effect of the lens in the wonderfully different futuristic world of England he creates.The violence in Children of Men is very disturbing, only because of the realism given it by the cinematography. Throughout the film, violence is always portrayed as something seen from afar or seen through one long moving take, like the perspective of someone there. For instance, there is a scene shot from inside the car occupied by many of the film's characters, and a frightening omen of the impending violence is seen far ahead, and all that happens is seen from within the car, the camera panning, the outside perfectly choreographed and fantastically stylized.Cuaron is one of cinema's finest recent directors, and a lot of that is evident not just in the visual style of his films, but also the many subtleties. In Children of Men, many characters use guns, but the hero, Clive Owen, never touches one. He's always in more danger than anyone else, making his entire journey all the more thrilling and powerful. Also, he eavesdrops in several intermittent yet extensive scenes, revealing a secretive side that only the audience can know about him.Clive Owen, whose range expands and whose presence grows with each surpassing performance, Michael Caine, who in his fortysomething years on screen has never failed to steal every scene he's ever shot, Chiwetel Ejiofor, whose presence is very strong, Claire-Hope Ashitey, who makes a breakthrough here, Pam Ferris, who give all to the melodrama her character particularly experiences, Peter Mullan, who gives another fun little bit part, and Julianne Moore, with her limited amount of screen time, all pack a punch.Children of Men also has one of the greatest soundtracks in recent years. It is filled with great older rock music, surprising alternative stuff, and a hauntingly subtle score. The film is also, perhaps aggressively, a celebration of love and affinity for animals, every character seeming to have dogs or cats or farm animals that they are attached to, all of which freely roam through every scene. This is a magnificent break from the increasingly infuriating bad omen of the death of the family dog that has been plaguing cinema for years along with a few other animal-based clichés. There is literally nothing wrong with this movie. It is first- rate cinema.",10,2,6,7 January 2007
Casualties of War," Compelling Pivotal Subject Matter Out of Context In De Palma's Context
","I want to say Scarface, The Untouchables and Casualties of War are Brian De Palma's best films, because they are his most serious in subject matter. But the truth is that his best work is in films like Sisters, Snake Eyes, Femme Fatale, The Black Dahlia. It is one thing to make a hyperstylized erotic thriller, because there doesn't have to be anything sincere about the film. But he brings the same sort of stiffly disassociated acting, point-of-view-shot set pieces, stock characters and melodramatically contrived dialogue to the story of a platoon in the Vietnam War and the rape to which they subjected a village girl. The movie's structure is not so much about the act as about the climate building to it, the dehumanizing authenticity of battle, the way it advocates brute force and rejects those who would try to live by a superior gauge.The pivotal sequence of the kidnapping, the march, captivity and gang rape of the girl is excruciating because it makes it so distinct how ineffectual Michael J. Fox's character's ethical fundamentals are in the face of a weapon cask. The other men either never had any issues about what they are doing, or have lost them in the bastardizing course of combat. They will do just what they want to do, and Fox is basically impotent to stop them. Based on actual events, this film makes it apparent that when a group histrionic of this kind is astir, there maybe is veritably nothing that a 'good' person can do to save the day. And its analysis of the actualities of the scenario is what's best about the movie.What is not so good are the scenes before and after the compelling pivotal subject. The movie begins and ends some time after the war, with Fox on a subway, where he sees an Asian woman who reminds him of the victim. The dialogue he has with this woman in the movie's last scene is so bound and stilted and tries so hard to manufacture a buoyant denouement into a grim movie, that it's as if it belongs in another movie.Defiant encounters with two commanding officers, Dale Dye (what a shock...) and Ving Rhames, are persuasive, but then the result appears half-baked and almost annexed. More than most films, mostly on account of the vital element of peer pressure, it relies on the potency of its performances for its impact, particularly on Penn's performance, but no one is a real character; everyone is an over-the-top caricature. Penn, with unmistakable conviction and enthusiasm in spite of the cartoonishness, is the bombastic leader of the bullies; John C. Reilly makes his movie debut here as the eager, dim-witted follower; Don Harvey is the sadistic right-hand enforcer for Penn; John Leguizamo is the quiet, sheepish guy who's not as bad but has no backbone. Although Penn's self-dramatizing comes from his deep sense of integrity to the frugal standards of De Palma's style, it seems that Fox is the only player whose capacity to turn ideas into realities and translate experience into words is not affected by the affectedness. Perhaps he's perfect for a De Palma leading man, as he does away with the frivolous.Objectivity is not De Palma's strong suit, which I don't necessarily see as a flaw: Who's truly objective, really? But maybe the movie would have been more impactful if it had just preserved the account as realistically as possible, devoid of De Palma's idiosyncratic artifice, his perfectionism too private and defensively preoccupied. That much would have included everything necessary that the movie has to show us.",7,10,13,5 July 2009
Event Horizon," Made of Whatever Materials at Hand
","Event Horizon is a bustling makeshift handiwork made secure by impressive production design and performances from actors who aren't easily embarrassed, but it begins with panache. It has the nuanced space vessels moving grandly against the domain of stars, it has the abysmal roar of the massive generators, it has sets boasting convincing technology, and it even has those high-pitched, jabbering, hardly discernible voice-like noises that remind us of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which give you the eerie sense that tiny creatures are plotting against you. The year is 2047. A rescue mission has been sent to Neptune's proximity, where seven years earlier the titular deep space research vessel vanished. As the rescue ship Lewis and Clark nears, its transmitters read that the temperature on board the other ship is freezing. No indication of human life is recognized. But there are signs of some other sort of life all through the ship. I love movies like this. I enjoy the dated fine points. Case in point: Everybody on board the rescue ship smokes, which is improbable in 2047 on a deep space mission where, later, the carbon dioxide air scrubbers will perform a vital function. And the captain, Laurence Fishburne, wears a leather bomber jacket, bespeaking that Neiman Marcus remains booming decades from now. I liked all of that stuff, though there wasn't much import to it.What happened to the ship named Event Horizon? Scientist Sam Neill might know. He created the ship's gravity drive, which candidly resembles a minor variation on the Machine in Contact, with three metal rings gyrating around an axis. The drive supposedly conceives a black hole and then sucks the ship through it, so that it can travel astronomical reaches in a second. Neill gives the binding junior high lecture on this process, taking a piece of paper and showing you how far it is from one side to the other, and then folding it in half so that the two edges meet, describing how that occurs when space bends. The crew members nod, observing sternly. They're an exceptionally qualified space crew, on a mission where space and time are livelihood, although they seem to know less about quantum theory than most of us home entertainment couch potatoes do. It's back to Physics 101 for them. They're more like a mix of marine caricatures, as is the case with the zealous and scripted deliveries by Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson, and even buddy cop foils, as is the unfortunate case for Richard T. Jones, playing a character cursed with so many horribly retarded lines that I hold the entire cast and crew responsible for not voicing the need for another rewrite: He's even carrying on like an Eddie Murphy bit when catapulted into space at one point.So, anyway, where did the ship go for seven years, and what occurred while it was there? Why is the first team all dead? Alas, Event Horizon is not the movie to field these issues. It's all flair, pay-off and special effects. Each scene revises the fundamentals: Early in the film the Lewis and Clark nears the Event Horizon through what I think is the tempestuous gravitational field of Neptune, with endless thunder, lightning and commotion. However as soon as those effects are taken advantage of, the remainder of the movie takes place in the tranquility of space. And although we are regaled with quite pleasant shots of Neptune, the crew members never regard the planet in astonishment, or acknowledge the remarkable spectacle that would shift any Earthling's paradigm forever. They're always so preoccupied with their obligatory, often cheesy dialogue they're heedless of their environment.The open-faced muse for this entertaining enough sleepwalking exercise in genre expediency, by the director of Mortal Kombat, is an incomparably superior but far less accessible film, Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, where a space station courses a colossal planet. The planet in that film is seemingly alive, and generates delusions in the minds of the space station inhabitants, making them believe they're back on Earth with their families. Same thing goes down in Event Horizon, where the crew members sublimate family members and colleagues they long for/cherish/blame themselves for the loss of, although where Tarkovsky was integrating the submerged psyche with the view of a planet as a single organism, Event Horizon exploits the figments and illusions of memory predominantly for jolts and cries of wolf, as well as distilling the antagonistic forces into a single supernatural villain stalking the ship like another Alien film.It is declared bleakly at one point that the gravity drive is an example of humanity going too far, into reaches we should not dare. There is a charge that someone has 'broken the laws of physics,' and from the way it's accused you'd think perpetrators will be put in jail or charged with damages. Naturally there are no 'laws' of physics, simply conclusions about the way things appear to be. What you 'break,' if you break anything, is no longer a law but just an outmoded view, now replaced by one that makes better sense. Soundly implanted in this movie is a mistrust of actual science. That's probably why its characters know so little about it.",7,0,1,30 May 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Public Justice, Private Happiness
","I'm always ready to censure the MPAA in whatever way I can. When they say, 'Strong brutal violence including a rape,' we think, well rape is strong brutal violence! You could've just said strong brutal violence without giving anything away! But in the case of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I'm beginning to see why they make that distinction. I could've seen someone get killed with seven chainsaws and not be as disturbed as I was by the rape scene that occurs a few minutes short of an hour into this surprisingly standard but strangely bewildering film. This rape is foreshadowed by a forced blowjob. The man is in knowingly and insatiably sadistic control of the woman. Then comes the rape proper. It goes on longer than it needs to in order to make the point that this woman is brutally raped. What is it telling us? An emotional point of reference, I believe, for the unraveling of the investigative plot later to come.Walking into this film adaptation of one of the most astonishing literary success stories in years, I was excited because of my previous experiences with Swedish cinema. The subtleties, the artfulness, the minimalism especially. Bergman, Sjostrom, Kaurismaki. I was off-put by the very mainstream American handling of the story, which is frankly, on the surface, quite an American creation. It's a mystery thriller, two unlikely underdog heroes teamed up to crack an ongoing case. And that's great! But there is also an edge to this story not unlike Mike Yanagita's scene in Fargo. During the story, we are subjected to seemingly extraneous chronicles of pure evil, harrowing brutality and subtext that seems constrained by the otherwise tight clockwork of the case-solving plot.Nevertheless, I am continually intrigued by said unorthodoxy of its structure. I have yet to read the book, and maybe I will soon. I love the first shots of the saga's heroine, Lisbeth Salander, as she walks alone through pedestrian tunnels. This is where I become absorbed in the tone and style of the picture. And I'm not let down as her character arc continues. She is truly one of the most intriguing main characters I've seen in a movie in a very long time. She is a mystery, characterized by significant hang-ups in her interactions outside of those she knows or chooses to engage, along with unvarying yet strangely contrary patterns of behavior and interests. I love her chemistry with Blomqvist, the journalist-under-fire who seems to be our central protagonist, how their arc together flirts with formula, but ultimately defies it.The performances are effective all around. But while all of the performances are powerful, including those of Michael Nyqvist as the admirably zen journalist, and Peter Haber as the implacable brother of the vanished girl in question, this movie and this character are endemic to Noomi Rapace, to the degree that casting anyone else as Lisbeth in a way almost sounds fool-headed. She commands a sophisticated and enticingly refractory performance in a story that shaves off coatings of society cues and behavioral expectations to reveal camouflaged penalties women suffer for their selfhood.",8,4,8,5 September 2010
Saw II," Making a Sequel to Saw Without Being Redundant Would Do What Saw II Has No Choice But to Do, Which is to Air Out the Mystique That Made the Original What It Is.
","This is the sequel to the horror film that mortified me more than any other horror film to this day. That horror film's sequel is the shocker that has come closer to making me ill more than any other horror film. It is either chance or a universal understanding of certain disgusting things of which I am hyperaware. As Twisted Pictures's $4 million survival horror sequel opens, someone finds out that a very important key has been implanted behind his right eye. He finds a scalpel nearby. The biggest doozy is when a group of victims comes upon a pit filled with thousands of used and bloody hypodermic syringes, with a key to an antidote hidden within. I have never come so close to passing out during a movie. And I have seen one whole hell of a lot.Saw II is a lot of impact in its brutality, but does not compare to its predecessor in terms of sheer fright. James Wan and Leigh Whannell's original Saw is claustrophobic, fear of the dark, fear of clowns, a horrific villain we only scarcely know thus one we only scarcely understand thus one that scares us. Making a sequel to this film without being redundant would do what this film has no choice but to do, which is to air out the mystique that made the original what it is.It is a very enjoyable film because the film features the Jigsaw Killer finally being apprehended, but trapping the thoroughly unscrupulous arresting officer, played by Donnie Wahlberg, in one of his own games while showing another one of his twisted machinations involving eight people in progress at the same time. It also explores Jigsaw's philosophical back story, which seems to feel more coherent in concept rather than in execution.Co-writer and director Darren Lynn Bousman, the Splat Pack newcomer who, beginning here, was tied to the Saw franchise for three of its outings, gives the film a brooding graininess and relentless grit, and frankly he does not resort to unnatural editing to manufacture a peak of intensity like James Wan did with the original, though Wan made a better film. There is, nonetheless, a feeling of expediency given to Saw II that undercuts the intensity anyway.Characters like Xavier, played by bouncer-turned-actor Franky G, a ruthless drug dealer among the eight victims, provoke shock and angst from us but that doesn't stop him from being ridiculous. Consider a character who, having abandoned the other seven, realizes that one number of the combination to the safe which holds an antidote they all urgently need, has been written on the back of each of their necks. He begins to endeavor upon stalking and killing them to see the numbers on the backs of each neck, rather than hastening their escape by notifying them all of what he knows, which would have them all working together as quickly as possible to achieve their common interest to survive this nightmarish situation. I can understand a character who is cold, selfish and ruthless, but I can't understand why such a person wouldn't keep his fellow captors alive if it would benefit him.By and large, Saw II is pure gorefest entertainment. There is more ferocious cruelty at a higher frequency than its ancestor, and less of a chill by the end which you cannot rationalize.",7,0,1,10 November 2008
Paranormal Activity," The Rare Quality of Quiet and Anticipation, Even Nothing Going On.
","Paranormal Activity is a cunning little horror film, so well made it's authentically creepy, that comes insisting it's the real thing. Without any sort of traditional opening or closing credits, it opens by thanking the families of the two central characters and closes with one of those Current Whereabouts Unknown title cards and a screen of copyright notices. This was ostensibly a film made without a director, a writer, a producer, sound, catering, grips, makeup orwell no it does have a cameraman. All of the footage is shown like it had been found afterward.As in Blair Witch, Rec, Quarantine, Cloverfield, et al, the plot gimmick is that one of the two characters recorded it himself. There isn't a single shot that defies that premise, even if certain ones appear practically unfeasible without other hands on the camera, but I may be wrong. A grad student and a day trader who've been together three years have now moved into a house in San Diego that doesn't look much occupied. It's well enough decorated, yet everything seems recent and there's no untidiness. Micah meets Katie out front one day by filming her on his new video camera, which she finds bulkier than his other one.They've been disturbed by auspices of some kind of ghostly goings-on in an upstairs bedroom. Micah's brilliant spark is to film in the house, leaving the camera rolling as a quiet watchman while they sleep. Like any man with a new toy, he grows consumed in this idea, the bottom line, for him, isn't Katie's despair but his movie. After one significant shock, she asks him doubtingly if he indeed went back to pick up his camera. One advantage of the plot gimmick is that for extended stretches of time the camera is apparently left on with no one running it. It's on a tripod at the end of their bed while they sleep, and we watch occurrences while they're sound asleep. Some of these things are considerably minute, and I won't outline any of them. The basis that they occur anyhow is the key. That they appear to occur by themselves, observed by a fixed camera, makes them scary, particularly because there are some shots that look beyond the bounds of possibility without special effects, and there's no discernible sign of any, looking as carefully as one can.He is usually off camera. She is in front of it in nearly every shot, and for all intents and purposes you could say that this is a predominantly one-woman show, and of Katie Featherston's performance it's sufficient to claim it is excellent for the aim of this film. She's not Emma Thompson, she's a young woman who looks and talks completely like she might be an everyday college student who has newly moved in with her boyfriend. Micah acts, well, precisely like a man. The sort who still has a rock band at thirty. Katie has been disturbed by some kind of ghostlike apparition since she was a child, and now she's gravely bothered, and Micah's reaction isn't much concern but a resolve to get it all down on camera. Nearly all horror movies are about teenagers for purely commercial reasons, and this film has the quality of showing us completely and totally relatable young people.I of course know thanks to IMDb that Paranormal Activity does actually have a writer-director, Oren Peli, and naturally other technical credits. Though akin to The Blair Witch Project, with which it's of course likened, it goes near and far to look like a film found after the fact. It succeeds. It demonstrates that quiet and anticipation can be more engrossing than machine-gun fast-cutting and manic effects. For long durations here, not a thing is going on, and trust me, you'll be paying strict attention.",8,1,2,30 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Diet Bulworth and Manic Pixie Dream Girl Literally Outrun Fate with a Hat
","We open as Matt Damon, a surefire candidate for senator, is familiarized to us via a pretty uninspired hodgepodge that includes the as-themselves cameos we now wait for in politically themed films, to provide what might misguidedly be referred to as realism. But he loses his lead and, rehearsing his concession speech in a hotel restroom, discovers Emily Blunt hiding from security. Instantly attracted to each other, of course, they kiss before being interrupted, of course. But, inspired by this stranger's generic advice, he makes a truly candid speech that revitalizes his ratings. But he ends up falling for that fleeting woman, becoming increasingly distracted from his career, despite mysterious men collaborating to keep them apart.Yes, they're agents of fate itself, so the lovers must either literally outrun it, or accept a predetermined path, which, ironically, the story unashamedly does almost from the get-go. And in due course, a characteristically paranoid Philip K. Dick tale about the easily broken textile of reality is reassessed as a comforting parable about true love's fortune and the correctness of the divine plan. This reassessment aspires to induce the intense visceral emotion of a high-flying romance that exceeds time, space and the natural order of things, but George Nolfi's writing is short of the crisp, relevant impact such material needs, which it isn't anyway when you already have a brilliant Dick story there's no legitimate worldly reason to substitute! And yet, the film still uses Dick's name, basically as an advertisement. Nolfi takes Dick's idea and runs, letting go of pages along the way, until he's left with only a torn title page, and a strained adjoining of two reasonably agreeable, remarkably featureless individuals that rouses none of the profound, awe-inspiring excitement essential in a storyline so deep in philosophy and metaphysics. Their rebellious romance never even moves much past the convention of the contrived encounter of two potential lovebirds in serendipitously unusual circumstances, followed by the contrived interval of mopey separation. It's but one de rigueur element of a script that grapples for a consistent shape, even resorting to Magical Negro and Retro Chic clichés, to significantly be about more than beautiful people fleeing from badass-looking bureaucrat-style villains through an expressive cityscape.After the initial disappointment in the film's resorting to manipulative schmaltz, its social implications are no surprise. Whenever Blunt and Damon are broken away, he takes for granted that, unless he can find her again, he'll never see her again. Sure, it's hard to find a woman in NYC when you know nothing more about her than her first name. It's a comparatively trouble-free achievement, however, to locate a superstar Senate nominee. But regardless of the movie's depiction of Blunt as an independent, progressive chick, she never takes any enterprise in any way to reconnect with the love of her life, nor does it ever dawn on anyone that she could. When Damon loses her number, she sulks for three years! When he's forced to forsake her in a hospital, she waits, brokenhearted, for 11 more months. This one-sidedness is made unmistakable when a divine courier praises Damon for his determination against all chances and then praises Blunt for, well, going along. This rare dud in the fight-the-system disposition of films portrays itself as a tribute to forging one's own future, provided, namely, that you happen to be a guy.But the point is that Dick's musings on celestial formalities have a mischievous, sardonic tone, and Nolfi's gratuitous revamping is less effective. The trilby hats, which grant extraordinary powers when worn by the members of the Bureau, and later the hero, are particularly difficult to take seriously! They're incapable of crossing interdimensional doorways that convey them instantaneously across Manhattan unless they're wearing, yes, their hats. But to be fair, on the whole, the script forces gullibility not with its offbeat imagination but with its dull particulars: We can't buy that security is in dogged search of this clearly harmless uninvited guest, nor, to name another plot point, are we persuaded that Damon's career would be wrecked by media hype about him mooning his college friends. If you're going to botch Dick, at least be as consistent as Dick.This movie is for those who want to have their fate both ways. The movie sustains the notion that an omnipotent 'Chairman' has a plan for our existence, yet this plan is not so inflexible that it excludes freedom. And yet when we seem to bring that self-rule to bear, we find we're still sticking to a master plan, one so vast even the 'adjusters' working at Earth level can't keep a handle on it. Deus ex machina performs such a key function in the way events resolve that it's challenging to leave feeling anything other than resentful, like a potential piece of brilliance has been unkindly run off with.",5,1,2,21 May 2011
World Trade Center," What Happened?
","I mean...man...Oliver Stone. That's right, the genius behind Platoon, The Doors, Natural Born Killers, JFK, Born On the Fourth of July, Midnight Express, and Scarface, the 'Emperor of Excess,' who got to where he is with his fearless edge. World Trade Center has no edge. If I'd not known it was directed by Stone, I would've actually said something like, 'Stone would be aggravated if he saw this.' Maybe he is, but the difference is that it actually is directed by him. Its problem is that it has the spirit of your average corny patriotic fluff. The dialogue, the characters, the plot itself, the slow-motion shots of melodrama...they're all on par with the work of some studio director-for-hire.The film starts off very well. It begins with the quiet atmosphere of early morning in New York City. It has a growing suspense. There's an effectively disturbing minimalist depiction of the attack on the Towers. After that, the movie takes the Pearl Harbor route and inflates with stale dialogue and token worried-wives-sitting-at-home characters and aggravating clichés such as those. yes, it's a true story, but the fluffy treatment of it is what takes it down.Perhaps Stone just wanted a surefire way to bring himself back up to the top after his long absence punctuated by the box office disaster of the underrated Alexander. A movie about 9/11 is both controversial and intriguing enough, and with his name attached, everyone knows they're in for a slashing perspective, but for whatever reason, he took the safest route through the story. Maybe he had to, because JFK and Platoon were made decades after Kennedy's assassination and the Vietnam War. Perhaps not enough time has passed for the masses to really be ready for such a harsh blunt-eye view of the September 11 attacks. I know I am, though.Hopefully Stone will get back on track. He's been off of it for way too long.",6,1,4,14 September 2006
Black Hawk Down," A Combat Blockbuster That Does Not Trivialize the Experiences of the Troops
","Neither a nationalistic constitutional in military muscle nor a sublime allegory about the fruitlessness of war, this Bruckheimer-produced blockbuster chronicles a U.S. military raid that went miserably awry when Utopian intentions ran into unforeseen defiance. In Somalia, in 1993, 18 Americans were killed, 70 more were wounded, and inside days President Bill Clinton pulled out troops that were on an altruistic errand. At that point, some 300,000 Somalis had died of starvation, and the U.S. purpose was to assist the arrival of U.N. food shipments. Somali warlords were more concerned with insulating their territory than feeding their people, a beforehand word to the wise of the sort of fanaticism that led to 9/11.Ridley Scott's $90 million thirteenth feature is unbending in its intent. It wants to chronicle as precisely as possible what it was like to be one of the soldiers under fire on that mission. Hour by hour, step by step, it patches up the sequence of actions. The idea was to set up an unforeseen incursion by helicopter-borne troops, joined by ground forces, on a meeting of a warlord's top lieutenants. This was thought to be such a bottom-line errand that some soldiers left behind their canteens and night-vision gear, expecting to be back at the base in a few hours.Enemy rockets brought down two of the helicopters. The warlord's troops rapidly cohered and surrounded the U.S. positions. Roadblocks and trifling transmissions hindered a support convoy from convening. And a cruel crossfire blossomed into a struggle of shame, remorse and erosion. The Americans gave better than they got, but from any perspective angle, the U.S. onslaught was a total mishap.The confrotnation indeed appears to have disintegrated into a gory free-for-all. Ridley Scott's realization is to relinquish it to some coherent degree to the audience. We understand, more or less, where the Americans are, and why, and what their situation is. We follow several leading characters, but only the sharpest of us may keep track of them and discern one from another. The movie doesn't rely on dialogue or characterizations. It is about the coordination of that day in October, and how training did help those soldiers to secure their own lives as well as probable when all the designs went wrong and they were forsaken.Showing implicit resilience in the face of a logistically mind-boggling production, Scott's compositional approach makes use of the aspect on that day of aerial spotter planes with infra-red sensors that could expose the action of the humans below. As the engagement unravels, Sam Shepard and his fellow officers can follow it on screens, but are incapable of taking advantage of this news. It is a valuable means for keeping the audience informed. We trail various dispersive strands: A man falls from a helicopter and is injured when he misses his descent rope. A pilot is taken prisoner. Frantic melees expand in streets and rubble as day turns to dusk. The Americans are short on ammo and water, confronting attackers not too reticent about subjecting themselves to peril.Though designed for action fans, Black Hawk Down doesn't have leonine limelight characters like most war movies. The leading characters are played by stars who will be acquainted with persistent moviegoers but may be hard to tell apart for others. They include Josh Hartnett, who makes us truly belief his character's concern for public welfare, as a staff sergeant in command of one of the raiding teams; live-wire Ewan McGregor as a Ranger specialist whose specialties are paperwork and coffee-making until he is pressed into service; Tom Sizemore as a veteran who provides steady counsel for younger troops, and the ardent William Fichtner as a chivalrous fighter who seems to have mentally embedded every atom of training, and exemplifies it inherently.The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak eschews the glaring hues of celebratory combat movies, and its desolate, granular shades steadily spend of light as night falls. The later scenes of the movie feel chilly and forlorn; the surrounded troops are alone and endangered in the night. The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Steve Zaillian, working from a book by Mark Bowden, understands the material and tells it so clearly and efficiently that we are involved not only in the experience of the day but also in its strategies and unfolding realities. Works like Black Hawk Down help audiences comprehend and invest in the real experiences of combat troops, rather than dispensing them into formula entertainments.",8,0,1,8 July 2009
The Dark Knight," Transcends the Superhero Genre
","So why doesn't Batman just kill someone like the Joker? Consider all the lives it would salvage. Batman has declined unswervingly to ever kill at all, substantiating that if he kills, he would be no better than the criminals he is avowed to stop. But doesn't an intractable vow not to ever kill seem almost selfish? Or is it? Generally we think a person is compelled to do what would do good for the most lives, but what if that is taking a life? Which is of greater consequence, doing good or avoiding wrong? One of the layers that I am grateful that this film is given is its consideration of the principles of killing to put a stop to imminent killings, which is the predicament Batman confronts when he weighs his personal beliefs against the numerous lives that he could save from the polar opposite carefree killing spree of the Joker.The best superhero movies are ones wherein impossible moral tests are presented philosophically between the troubled hero and the villain who is unentangled by such dilemmas, with the exception of one like RoboCop, which depicts a future in which there's no morality but law. But in spite of fulfilling this rewarding criteria, The Dark Knight is not just a superhero movie, and that is what I like about it. It takes on the tone and plot structure of Heat, The Departed or Serpico. It's a film that rises above its beginnings, surprising us as a gripping crime drama about moral dilemma. It does not, however, bring us to care more about the characters than we would in another superhero movie just because of its extensive backstories and reminiscing monologues. The performances are not quite deserving of the objective exaltation they are expected to merit. But what makes it so much better than any other superhero movie is its rethinking of the prospects of the 'comic-book movie.'Not only a tremendous improvement over not only Batman Begins and the preceding Batman films but the only Batman film, it's not a simple tale of good and evil, and by that I mean that it is a tale of good vs. evil, but it is not by any means a simple one. Batman is the zealous crusader for good, no matter what. The Joker is evil, and the most interesting aspect of his character is that he is never definitely explained. Batman is under the greatest pressure he has ever experienced as Gotham is riotously angry, blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others, having taken the law into his own hands. The Joker is an impetuous, eccentric psychopath whose deeds have exploded epiphanically into his head to cruelly pose moral catch-22s for Batman, the police, civilians, even the remaining Gotham crime element.What anyone could've perceived months before the release of The Dark Knight as the biggest box office boost a movie could ever be incidentally given by a mere twist of fate is also the most talked-about element, the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Will he win the first posthumous Oscar since Finch? Well, I wouldn't be surprised, and it wouldn't be such a ridiculous thing, but I really want to look beyond the hype and stroke of tragedy of his performance. His clown makeup slapdash and shoddy, his cackle indicative of unfathomable wounds, he creates clever circumstances that force Batman, Commissioner Gordon and DA Harvey Dent to reach insufferable resolutions. By the end, the entire honorable groundwork of Batman is in jeopardy. The Joker is a fascinating villain in The Dark Knight, and surpasses even Jack Nicholson's portrayal. Ledger did deeply understand the impulse and anarchy of this new rendering of the Joker. There's a little of everything in him. One cannot rely on his character being coherent, so there are endless surprises to him. In addition to Ledger's movie-stealing oddball charisma, the brilliance of this version of the Joker keeping his intentions obscure, knowingly forcing people to jump to conclusions which he'll then fine- tune to his best advantage, is the benefit of one of the most interesting things about the original character: With how much vehemence should we malign him? Is he joking?The cast, loaded with greats, Caine, Oldman, Freeman and of course Bale, does not quite give Oscar-worthy performances. Bale, having developed a determined understanding of the Batman/Bruce Wayne character, still takes some awkward steps, such as a petty one but a misstep nonetheless, a moment where he uses his severely raspy Batman voice when he is alone with Morgan Freeman, who knows his identity so there's no reason for him to disguise his voice. But Christopher Nolan does not allow the special effects to upstage them, and nearly any viewer must be taken aback by how intensely the drama involves us. It is habitual for a comic book movie to preserve a detachment from the story, and thus their recurring audiences care little about the coherence or effect of it. The Dark Knight is made by filmmakers who believe in the classic blockbuster that engages us.The effects are remarkable. They concentrate on the anticipated explosions and disaster, and have some first-class, highly structured chase scenes. To boot, there is a handful of momentary shots of the Joker so well composed and hauntingly portrayed by Ledger that they stuck with me more than anything else, strangely. This movie may hit same notes as a film noir or a cops-and-robbers picture, but it still doesn't play with the full deck that those sorts of movies tend to have. The collective conscious of Gotham seems to be occupied with nothing but crime. Aaron Eckhart's character, Harvey Dent, the blonde, blue-eyed lion of a city hero, has such an iron-clad moral compass that it is a little shocking the extent to which he goes. Nevertheless, who cares? What a ride.",8,3,9,30 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Grows Some Chest Hair.
","It's blistering. Harry is overcast with lonesomeness, bullied by his abusive cousin Dudley, also in the testosterone throes of puberty. And this is when Dementors attack, those hellish soul-eaters, the terror keepers of the wizard prison. What they're doing here is unknown at present, but that's what makes it especially tense. Newbie director David Yates' refusal to go easy on his audience, regardless of age, is evident right away. There's magic here, but there's nothing saccharine or bright about it. This is magic as power, as an illustration of familiar human urges both dignified and horrendous, as something as real, bleak and patent as the tattered, graffiti-scribbled pedestrian tunnel, severely lit in gray-green, in which the Dementors assail.This fifth installment in Harry's imaginative and budding chronicles perfectly amalgamates the nimble humor and frivolous charm of the first two films and the cockeyed growing pains of the brilliant third and troubled fourth. Unlike so many fantasy stories, each episode provides new perspective, as here when Harry familiarizes Weasley with the experience of riding the London Underground, upturning the awe you'd expect from a Harry Potter movie: The wizard folks in awe of such commonplace phenomenon as we Muggles undervalue. Indeed, this wholly achieved world seems newly fertile and vivid: The wizard newspaper all of a sudden gives the impression of Minority Report's dynamic newspapers. Maybe highly developed magic is more or less interchangeable with technology.As opposed to The Goblet of Fire, the hormone-racing gravity being introduced in The Order of the Phoenix to the once very light-hearted saga is smartly balanced, not relying so heavily on whose dates are successful, whose crushes are requited, rock bands, dances, and instead looking to the rebellious impulses of our largely anti-authoritarian, autonomy-seeking teen years. Instead of a focus on mawkish romantic tropes, there is a sense of hormonal aggression. In the climactic sequence, the use of magic wands practically resembles a stand-off with guns a la the video games and action films teenage boys grow attached to at the age of the characters.In addition, a Roald Dahl-style new touch pops into the magical assembly of eccentrics, Imelda Staunton's scene-stealing Delores Umbridge, a fully engrossing character whose only flaw is her way too on-the-nose name. She seizes more than a small amount of interest as the conniving schoolmarm in blush-shade attire and weird feline fixation, as voodoo is paradoxically reimagined as genuinely shocking pink. She's a new teacher who brings a tyrannical say-so to the esteemed classrooms and hallways of Hogwarts, as she coaxes her way to despotism. It's a pitch-perfect concept for this particular stage in the saga of Rowling's maturing character, and neither Staunton, Yates or screenwriter Michael Goldenberg make any missteps in bringing her to the screen.Rather than placating and patronizing the sensibilities of teens in a Twilight-oriented manner, Order of the Phoenix speaks to the defensive rising of the teenage attitude. Hogwarts is under relentless bombardment by the venal, undemocratic Ministry of Magic. Miss Umbridge is persecuting him and wreaking fault on him. He and Dumbledore are objects of a propaganda crusade. Harry's 'love' interest is found to be less than loyal. He's wracked by shame and perception of pending peril. Harry is one estranged wizard.On the face of it, it may appear Yates, already an old hand at British television, is simply meant to continue the franchise in a practiced but not unique way. No, Yates brings a new visualization to the series and gives it pulsating vivacity that was sadly lacking in Goblet of Fire. He is a clever, elegant stylist. He is cinematically practiced, and character is a main concern for him. He uses black in a way very keenly attuned to the coming of age not only of the characters but their fans. In most fashionable modern movies, CGI grows unnecessary and mercenary almost as soon as it appears. However, Yates uses special effects as an internal part of the magicians' real world. The effects never engulf or overpower character. They're exceptional, largely because they unite with characterization and Mark Day's supremely artistic editing. Like Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban, it does not reinvent the wheel. It just keeps it ever spinning.",8,0,1,21 May 2011
Annie Hall," La-Di-Da, La-Di-Da, La La
","Annie invites Alvy up to her apartment for the first time. They have a drink and chat. Subtitles tell us what each person's thinking throughout. We see that what they're saying is not what they're thinking. More particularly, because they're essentially preoccupied with impressing each other and forming a new relationship, we see a dialogue wherein they're both too engrossed in assessing their own performance to totally partake. They censure what they're saying as they're saying it, and accordingly, their actual interaction becomes practically hollow. What makes this scene hilarious is the incongruity between what both people are saying and what they're thinking. Normally, we don't get such an advantaged spy-hole on a conversation. And watching this scene, we become conscious that these discrepancies between thought and speech surface along with the prospect of romance. The deeper connotation's that romantic relationships are somehow very different from friendly ones, that romantic ones characteristically involve deception on some level.Alvy ruminates on his elementary school days, where there's an off-the-wall incorporation of the present with the past. We hear him narrate about his class as we watch the action. At some point though, the adult Alvy steps into the scene, intermingles with the children and teacher of his past, who then act like they're living in the present along with him. The wittiness here's rooted in the peculiar temporal absurdities regarding him and his classmates, who are hilariously children and adults simultaneously. And it nurtures vital issues about the connection between our childhood and adult actions, between genetics and culture in shaping behavior. When we hear the kids talking about what they've become as grown-ups, we instantly start to laugh in wonder at how they got from this to that. How do innocent seven-year-old children, with like cultural backgrounds, grow up to be so different from each other? What inborn temperaments and fusion of occurrences in their lives led to such wide-ranging identities? Allen proposes no answers for these questions, but he undoubtedly instills these uncertainties. They encompass the background feel for the rest of the film. To be sure, one of the key ideas of Annie Hall is our powerlessness to ever get a thorough grasp of how and why people change. Periodically, we're offered self-spoofing philosophical masturbation about this multifaceted subject, but never are we given an ultimate resolution of it. The insinuation's that we may never have a complete one.Like Seinfeld, Annie Hall taps reflexive humor from everyday occasions: quarrelling about whether it's tolerable to enter a movie after it's begun; withstanding tedious cocktail parties. I can conceive of George relating to Alvy's slant on romance: He doesn't want a woman who'd want him. And mightn't Kramer have been disheartened as a kid over the expansion of the universe? Why does dialogue always seem more real in Woody Allen films? Because he doesn't begin conversations with someone arriving, end with them leaving, transposing trite formula onto an otherwise good story. Instead, it works to conceive variations, opening scenes in the middle of things, ending dialogues without prolonging them, without people straining to bring things to a finish. He keeps characters' words from delineating the sense of opening and closure. As well, many comedians kill jokes by giving too much or little information that gives us our grasp, or by either hastening or prolonging the pace of the information delivery. Consciously setting us up to laugh needs a sharp familiarity with a scenario, including delicate particulars about the vibes and expectations of an audience, then making them abruptly conscious of an unanticipated change, such that some initial notions about the situation are spontaneously changed.Slimly built, anxious, rambling, bespectacled, wildly gesturing, highly strung, and a ceaseless wit, Woody as an actor is both familiar and personal, and with her ditzy proclivity for men's clothing, WASPy background and airy exhortations, fish-in-the-Manhattan-sea Annie is the spot-on counterpoint to Alvy's Jewish NYC valetudinarian. Though she's remembered more for her fickle naivete, it's Annie's obscurely morose tendencies---she requires pot to take pleasure in sex, her analyst proposes five sessions a week---that gives her profundity. And what gets us stuck on her is the breezy sweetness, idiosyncratic beauty and natural comic timing of Keaton herself. Whether she's playing herself or a variation on herself or what Woody envisioned, it's all her. Even that iconic look. And yet the word I believe best describes her performance is effortless. She simply doesn't hide her reactions, doesn't seem to have a fixed Method-style concentration on character, motivation. She's just herself in 1977.Allen uses broad comedy, breaking the fourth wall and even a cartoon sequence to break comic distance and allow us to see from Alvy's point-of-view. It's an unassumingly compelling vehicle for imparting philosophically valuable ideas, highlighting unanticipated incongruities in each scene, using them to reap fresh thematic understanding. Joking's not subject to the same criticism as other exchange of ideas, and this makes it viable to persuade the audience to consider thoughtful subjects generally not dealt with. In so many scenes, nearly every one, Allen draws on absurdist humor straightforwardly to broach fascinating theoretical doubts, and gets the audience to contemplate them. Indeed, it's repeatedly the case that the raising of such questions is a central part of the film's subject matter.Creating a stream-of-consciousness narrative, Allen uses an intellectual style of editing, but also a buildup of cutting based on the mind's distortion of time, multifaceted visual arrangements and stage-managed chronological length of shots to fuse the film's effect on us for a more concentrated, conceptual effect than eliciting our most straightforward, reactive sleepwalk through a standard formula. At the end, we're left with more questions about subjects like love than we had at the start of the film. It looks to be Allen's aim to point up that there are no simple answers to particular crucial questions about life, to cultivate our understanding of the complexities involved in grasping such complicated matters.",10,1,2,20 October 2010
Toy Story," If You Saw This As a Kid and Haven't Seen It Since, Feeling You Have Outgrown It, You Must Revisit It, For You WIll Discover Quite the Contrary.
","Toy Story fashions an existence as its characters know it out of a couple of young kids' bedrooms, a gas station, and an expanse of suburban freeway. It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks. And the result is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie experience that does not diminish with age.For kids, a movie like this works immaculately because it tells a fun story that presumably exists already somewhere in their minds when they are playing with their own toys. They can relate very deeply to these toy characters because of the role toys play in their lives. Older viewers can be even more immersed, because you find that after all these years, you still have such emotion invested in these toys. When Woody peeks from the toy chest at his boy, Andy, sleeping with Buzz Lightyear in his arms, I am truly touched. If you saw this as a kid and haven't seen it since, feeling you have outgrown it, you must revisit it, for you will discover quite the contrary.In a way, it could have been even more interesting and rewarding to have been your parents' age in 1995 when the film emerged as the first film animated entirely by computer. To us as kids, visual nuance was the last thing on our minds. The most rudimentary elements of the cinematic experience were all that mattered to us, and we were transported. Now, we are completely accustomed to Pixar's series of family films that transcend what one normally perceives as the cornball throwaway inanity of so many of them.John Lasseter opens the film in the---let's face it---spoiled 8-year-old's bedroom, where the toys come to life when their owner is gone. Each of the toy characters is rich and detailed. The playroom cunningly figures in well-known toys from real life, which may be product placement, but who cares when it functions as a great way for us to relate that much more with these characters by means of direct familiarity.",10,0,0,22 October 2008
The Graduate," Masterpiece of Direction
","I had never seen The Graduate all the way through until yesterday, ashamed of being a movie buff who'd never seen it before. I loved it. It isn't the zany comedy I thought it would be, however it's something much more urbane and cerebral. Really, it's just a demonstration of some of the greatest film direction I've ever seen.Mike Nichols brings a quiet intensity to the movement and rate of the film, almost like a suspense film. Relative to Scorsese, his insinuation of time lapse is done with a mixture of hard cutting, closing in and closing out of tight shots, and a jukebox-like switch from one piece of music playing over the soundtrack to another. His camera-work altogether is an intense, very fixated series of extended shots, some of them taking us through long-lasting periods of action beginning with the profile shot of Dustin Hoffman on the automatic walking belt at the airport during the opening credits and his sustained closeup as he walks through his parents' party and is constantly stopped with several people invading the frame, creating the feeling of his space being violated. The film is in essence of series of shots like these, and it has a tremendous effect on the style, atmosphere, and pace of the film, especially during its scenes of wry humor, as does the recurring soundtrack integrated with Simon and Garfunkel and David Grusin.The early performance by Hoffman is very entertaining, a much-imitated comically shy young man who opens up only to inadvertently reveal himself as a force to be reckoned with, and Bancroft's performance is one for the books, riveting in her screen time as one of the great femmes fatale, both performances sharply contrasting in charisma to the less memorable Ross.The Graduate is one of the milestones of the 1960s, one of the greatest decades for cinema, and it carries on its lingering influence.",10,1,2,17 December 2006
Avatar," The Lion is Back to Roar Again.
","When all is said and done, when you look at Avatar as a movie apart from its social phenomenon, you are supposed to find this a parable for Western politics. Cameron clearly does. Indeed, implicating computer technology for its central role in man-made destruction, Avatar nevertheless utilizes the very same to create some of its innovative and hugely influential visuals. The bulk of Cameron's work displays an apparent distrust of technological advancement which is peculiarly at variance with his elaborate deployment of state-of-the-art cinematic technology. His post-Vietnam and post-feminist action epics---Aliens, the Terminator movies, True Lies---draw upon both technological and nuclear anxiety in the midst of Reagan's resurgent Cold War politics.Avatar itself is fundamentally hailed for being a technological advancement. It is an exceedingly, outlandishly gigantic visual experience unlike anything we've seen before. It has an explicit Green and anti-war message. The writings on the wall dictate that it launch a worshipping faddism. It contains such visual embellishment that it surely sweetens repeated viewings. It even authors a new language to which I doubt human beings can do justice. It is the quintessential event movie, one of those films you feel you need to see to keep up with social discourse. Setting Napoleonic, Bond villain-esque humans against virtuous extraterrestrial rebels is a hopeful U-turn of the Aliens stencil, but perhaps requires Paul Verhoeven's keen comic-book intensity to drive the reversal into real subversion.The human analogy on the lush, Earth-like moon of Pandora is a ten-foot-tall blue-skinned species of sentient humanoids called the Na'vi. An Earth corporation is mining a valuable mineral known with mystifying ambiguity as unobtanium. But for us humans to brave outside of our landing domain, we use avatars, Na'vi doppelgangers grown naturally and mind-controlled by humans who lay down wired up unconscious on the ship, which is where the 3-D element becomes more than just an ogling tool and takes on a metaphysical effect. While functioning as avatars, we sense and feel like Na'vi, and have all the same physical skill. The most interesting element of this is how the hero is a paraplegic. Rather than being a self-evident badass, he's been recruited since he's a genetic match for his dead twin brother, for whom an expensive avatar was constructed. In avatar state he is exhilarated by his magnified ability to walk again, not to mention being ten feet tall, and his compensation for this assignment he will be given a very expensive operation to recover movement in his legs. Theoretically he's good to go, for if his avatar is harmed, his human body is elsewhere.The Na'vi survive in their world by having a deep relationship with it, living as one with nature, and being thoughtful about the creatures they share with. In this and various other ways they symbolize Native Americans. Like them, they discipline another species to have them at their disposal, like giant flying dragon-like creatures. On that admirable note, I found the significance tapering into impatience nearing its obligatory colossal climactic showdown between humans and aliens. After all a character has done that has betrayed the noble Na'vi, returning to them with a demonstration that he has tamed a supposedly untamable dragon-like super-creature, all is forgiven. It's just too sexy for them to stay mad anymore.Indeed the bigger it all is, the cockier. Every bit of James Cameron's muscle seems to go into making our eyes bulge and genuflect in worship of the 3-D dazzle on the screen. On one hand, it's an outstandingly accessible exhibition of defying capitalism and championing the up-hill battle for the defense of nature, but done with mostly stale dialogue and boilerplate characterization. Essentially, it's a $237 million, 162-minute montage of cardboard allegories and plot devices, made by putting a bunch of screenplays in a blender. But we still say Wow! And why not? If you can get a theater full of people here in the American Midwest to flock to and cheer for America getting conquered by an indigenous tribe in war, then you've got one amazing work of spectacle. It's the experience, more than the allegory, that's worth a nod.",8,2,4,4 May 2010
Grindhouse," Like If Scorsese and Coppola Got Together To Make a Double Feature Called 'Italian'
","Robert Rodriguez's feature, Planet Terror, has a script that is not purely the stuff of B-list cheese chock full of blood, goop, breasts, and guns. It is purely the recycling of that stuff from an eager fanatic's mind. While it's being set up, it's very intriguing, but like all Rodriguez films, its sustained plot later on is stale and routine. Also as always, his stories are held together by the single clever quality in them, which is the inventiveness of weaponry and scenes of violence, the main instance being namely in this case Rose McGowan's large machine gun attached to her body in place of a severed leg.It has a wonderful atmosphere during its exposition. It switches around several characters in different settings, all fashioned with a surreal, exotic style. Simultaneously, Rodriguez very much keeps in the vein of grindhouse mimic. The screen is grainy throughout every frame and intermittently distorted and fumbled by an incompetent fantasy projectionist, and the amateurish spirit of the film is entirely appropriate, even if that quality bears no difference from the rest of Rodriguez's movies.What is concerning me the most about Rodriguez's latter films is his increasingly blatant affinity for castration. It all started with Once Upon A Time In Mexico when Antonio Banderas crushed two men's genitals into a jelly with his bare hands. His next film, Sin City, contains three major castration scenes, not to mention several references and threats pertaining to groin violence throughout. Now in Grindhouse, there's a character who has a collection of testicles of the men who've betrayed, crossed, or failed him, complete with a scene that demonstrates this. This is a ridiculous, troublesome and largely disconcerting phase Rodriguez must promptly nip in the bud before it grows out of hand, as the subject seems to grow more prominent in each film, and he becomes known for this by a unanimously concerned audience. It doesn't help much when the dog violence occurs, after he seemingly gains our trust that he will not give into the dog casualty cliché.Overall, Planet Terror is more Rodriguez fun-fluff with passion not so much driving the story and expression but the technical film-making itself, and not even in the language of it but in the fun to which Rodriguez always panders in the mere use of a blue screen, holding the camera himself, editing it himself, scoring it himself. This is perfect, however, for the theme and nostalgia of Grindhouse.Tarantino's Death Proof is a different story. Death Proof is a work of more substance. The script is focused on the chemistry and relationships between its female friends, and it portrays these characters and their interactions with what Tarantino might seem to think of as realism. The story moves with an undoubted, forceful unpredictability. Its surprises are the stuff of real movies with a narrative manipulating decent thrills and reactions from its audience. This is all good, but is it the stuff of grindhouse cinema? Death Proof begins with the look and feel of an old 1970s camp flick, but gradually that fades and Tarantino cannot help or hide that it is a real movie. The reason for this is that honestly Tarantino is and always has been above 'grindhouse' cinema and kung fu or Z-list car chase popcorn flicks. His movies, despite his desperate attempts to portray them as sendbacks to this class of cinema, have always resonated with the expression of a real and gifted filmmaker. I think that the reason the grain and inept projectionist gimmick in his cinematography here fades is because he cannot help but shoot and craft a film the best way he can to tell the story in the most effective possible way, not that he does but that is a goal he seems to indecisively try to reach.Death Proof has a pretty terrific car chase, and when seen in the theater, as this film within the fabric of the outer movie Grindhouse is strictly intended to be. Does the chase begin as yet another 'homage' of his to an earlier favorite? Yes. Is it gripping and are your feet pressing harder and harder against the floor as if you yourself are urgently trying to control the brakes and gas pedals of the cars in frustration caused by suspense? Yes.The film's vital flaw, a summation of all of its smaller flaws, is that unfortunately both features are interchangeable. Rodriguez's Planet Terror has the theme and nostalgia but none of the wit and narrative passion, and Tarantino's Death Proof is virtually vice versa, just as one could say when comparing any other given pairing of movies by the two men. If Grindhouse's nostalgic statement were not so painstakingly clear based on the fake trailers and the two feature directors' previous work, then it would be lost in what's basically a double feature of two directors who are doing nothing more than what they always do. What both don't seem to realize (or maybe they don't care) is that they've made entire careers out of paying homage to grindhouse. For the fifteen years both directors have been working, they've not yet made truly personal work. They've stayed perpetually in the mindset of the ol' days of fun, bad no-brainer movies. The only difference is that Rodriguez doesn't seem to have any potential beyond that sort of film and Tarantino seems to fear making a movie that's entirely his own, perhaps because if he did, then he couldn't deflect criticism with justifications prepared by his uses of homage.The highest points of the movie really are the trailers before and in between features. They are some of the most entertainment and hilarity you will ever get from going to a movie theater. They are what truly make you feel like you are in that fantasy world, where you really feel like you're in some old sleazeball movie house from generations ago.",10,1,7,9 April 2007
Mission: Impossible," Lalo Schifrin, Meet Danny Elfman.
","The plot of the original summer blockbuster re-imagining of Mission: Impossible is a virtually unfathomable maze of post-Cold War duplicity, though the fine points barely count. It's all an arrangement for exciting chase sequences and a skilled computer theft procedure, intercut with that most dependable of spy movie supplies, the midnight meeting under a street lamp in a frosty foreign city.Cruise is Ethan Hunt, specialist spy, whose mission is to stop the stealing of a computer file holding the aliases and true identities of all of America's infiltrators. It's not sufficient to just obstruct the guy. Cruise and his team are supposed to snap pictures of the opponent taking the information, and then pursue him until he drops it off. This procedure concerns a check list of Cold War chestnuts: Bifocals with incorporated TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in ornate disguise, exploding cars, shankings, shootings, bodies falling into a river, and the like. Naturally the entire sequence focuses on an embassy party in Prague.Self-consciously baroque and formal as always, this is nevertheless still certainly one of director Brian De Palma's very best works. Rather than trying to bring his preference for stylistic flamboyance over substance to material of substance, Mission: Impossible is perfectly suited for him, as it affords him the ample playground for his often subtly deceptive and reflexive exploration of voyeurism. It comprises a chain of impressive set pieces. Any deeper engagement with the film is overpowered by the strict adherence to spectacle.There are so many double-blinds in the first 45 minutes that we're trained to judge nothing and no one merely by facade, not even their facades, because they may be ornate Adrian Messenger-style latex masquerade. And the drive of the visuals stops us from asking commonsense questions like, Is actually reproducing a computer file onto another disc the one way to get it? Don't you guys have hackers? Like most De Palma films, this Tom Cruise vehicle is all polished lather and procedural dexterity. The characters are not terribly intriguing, save Vanessa Redgrave as an information broker, who extracts a trace of melancholy in a film too impulsive for apathy of any sort. The assorted stratagems of Cruise and his associates and enemies don't hold water under analysis. And that makes little difference.This is a movie that lives in the moment, and we must be in the moment to take pleasure in it. Any off-putting doubts from earlier in the film must be resolutely subdued.De Palma is proficient at grand, slow-moving vistas of tension and violence. This $100 million action film gives him the chance for more modern versions of the vintage wordless action sequence. There are three here: The introductory scenario at the ambassadors' soirée, a fragile feat of computer burglary and an absolutely incredible bullet-paced climactic chase that I would call a masterpiece were it not scored overmuch. It's where a helicopter trails the express London-Paris line into the Chunnel with Cruise and the now revealed ultimate villain clutching on top of it.The computer burglary scene will strike a loud chord with anyone who has seen Rififi or Topkapi, both by Jules Dassin, who became renowned for his extensive heist sequences executed in utter silence. Topkapi also shares in common with Mission: Impossible the method of hanging a thief from an opening in the ceiling to circumvent ultra-sensitive security mechanisms on the floor. This time, De Palma gives us a computer safe room engineered so that sirens will wail at any sound above a particular decibel level, any weight on the floor, any variation in temperature.Naturally it's handy that the decibel level is set high enough that it isn't activated by the sound of a computer copying a disc, which is exactly what it should be resisting. Fitting, too, that the infra-red rays safeguarding the ceiling hatch can be so expediently contended with. And quite opportune for the audience that the rays are made discernible to the untrained eye. If you want to see infra-red rays thoroughly explored in a caper, watch Grand Slam.The main thing is, Cruise looks hip and holds our interest while doing clever things that we don't completely grasp, doing them so rapidly and with so much elegance that we put our questions on the back burner and glide with enjoyment. When the movie ends, it turns out there wasn't anything apart from the wind. Our relief, apparently, is that we enjoy ourselves.",8,4,4,22 February 2011
Saw," Mortifyingly Claustrophobic Splatter Film
","When I first saw this ideal sleeper hit, I was absolutely terrified. It wasn't that it was violent or Gothic. Rather, it was that it is claustrophobic even when the story reaches beyond its main setting, an unsavory dungeon warehouse bathroom. Saw never comes up for a breath of pleasant fresh air, even by the mortifying end, an end that will make even the most adventurous or free-flowing of viewers become at least scared of the dark. This was the most scared I had ever been by a movie from the horror genre. I loved it for its nonstop bearhug of creepiness.The film opens as Adam wakes up in a bathtub full of water, getting out of the bathtub and screaming for help, then Dr. Lawrence Gordon tells him that screaming for help is no good because he tried it already, meaning he was awake some time before Adam. How could Adam have been submerged water for so long without drowning? No matter. Bearhug of creepiness. Now, in the neglected industrial bathroom, Adam and Gordon are chained by their ankles to pipes at opposite corners. In the room between them is a dead body with a revolver and a micro cassette recorder loosely in grip. Lawrence and Adam each find tapes in their pockets labeled 'Play Me.' According to the disguised voice on the tape, Adam has to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence must kill Adam before six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be deserted to die captive in this room. This is the irresistible set up for Saw, one so intelligently designed to inject us with great tension in the first single minute that I dread the idea of ever seeing it in the quintessential modern-day American horror film theatrical experience, surrounded by a nearly sold-out rowdy, shouting, giggling, starting and restless audience. It demands our intention.Its concept, which is unraveled which the crisp enough pace to ensure that we are enduring the suspense, is one which does not just play on our irrational human fears that usually result in horror films like Jaws, Night of the Living Dead or Rosemary's Baby. It connects with true misery, helplessness and paranoia to its terrors. For better or for worse, this is a real breakthrough in the realm of debuts among young fanboy filmmakers. And you can tell that James Wan has some growing up to do: His movie inserts, flashes back, speeds up and machine gun-edits too much. Wan could have intensified the horrific atmosphere by letting an image speak for itself without screaming at us that it's an intense moment.But the talent, ambition and spirit behind his work, not to mention the wit and flair of Australian screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who stars as the panicked Adam, is highly infectious. With the surfacing of the 'torture porn' genre in the past decade, the Saw film series, together with similarly relentless shockers like Eli Roth's Hostel and Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects, is often discerned as an instance of the frequency of manipulatively attractive and stylized graphic violence and gore in contemporary horror films. Nonetheless, Saw is perhaps the very least exploitative of them all, especially Hostel and The Devil's Rejects.Splatter pictures, owing to the wear and tear of special effects and extreme amounts of blood and guts, have a propensity for exhibiting an explicit attraction to the weakness of the body and the sensationalism of its maiming. Saw is, yes, an inordinately violent movie. The word might actually be sadistic. However, Saw's gore and brutality come inherently from its concept, which is designed to horrify us.Saw may be a great horror film, but it is not quite a great film. By and large, its cast gives B- movie performances. There are suspense sequences in which a character makes a glaringly unrealistic choice. Wan needs to mature into a more confident filmmaker with a better understanding of the language of editing. In spite of these things, it's the kind of horror movie of which we need to see more: A horror movie that is as smart as you.",9,1,3,6 November 2008
A Clockwork Orange," The Psychosomatic Associations of Music
","It's all been said about A Clockwork Orange, I think. From McDowell's eerie iconic performance to the controversy over its supposedly 'pornographic' violence to its satirical portrayal of governmental and civic abuse of liberty, this utterly genre-less work of sublimity remains one of those mystifying pinwheels of the cinema. Kubrick's painterly, insoluble kaleidoscope is most often explained as political satire, or dystopian sci-fi, or a crime drama, while its intersecting allure to the horror fan community is clearly pervasive. Though I don't pretend to entirely understand this film, I nevertheless find it profound and unique, especially in its loaded portrayal of the psychosomatic associations we make with music, or that music makes with us. A crucial musical instant in Kubrick's inspired carrying out of Anthony Burgess' inventive story comes when Alex bursts into song in the bath.He's just been beaten and almost killed by his former 'droogs' who've been rehabilitated as policemen by manipulative judicial rule, looking to safeguard its society even if it has to confine them to do so. In desperate search of a home, Alex has unconsciously meandered in from a rainstorm only to realize he is back at the place of one of his 'ultra-violent' crimeswith a doorbell whose chord tone is the opening bar of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Here, years before, he and his milk-guzzling goons disabled a radical writer, Patrick Magee in enjoyably frenzied form, and raped his wife throughout a standard night on the town. Magee's eyes exceptionally gush excruciating sonorities and a full to bursting house boy whose sculpted physique and size guarantee that the master's safety will never again be disturbed.The cold-blooded delinquent's initial anxiety at being recognized by his now wheelchair-bound host swiftly scatters as Alex remembers he wore a Pinocchio-penis mask, craftily supplementing the brimming jock ensemble of the hooligans' costumes, throughout the real-life nightmare. More substantiation of his obscurity is discovered in the day's paper where the freshly sprung 'reformed' criminal's mug gilds the headlines, proclaimed as a mammoth triumph for the government's crime layout. But the warm, foamy water unwinds the liberated fluke, who feels so at ease that he thrashes out one or two choruses of Singin' in the Rain: Trouble is, that was the jingle he felt unencumbered enough to bawl while having his 'in-out' with Magee's voluptuous wife. Hearing the same crooner who reduced his life to rubble sets the author off to extract a musical vengeance: Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.To make Alex not dangerous to recommence his life in the social order, and preclude the government thousands in prison costs, he's barraged with gruesome imagery of violent promiscuous sex, brutal beatings and genocide until any inkling of these appalling ways causes a bodily nausea of vomit-inducing magnitude. Played relentlessly throughout this total indoctrination, Beethoven's most illustrious, celebrated and astounding conception, a personal beloved of the classical-music enthusiast whose ménage à trois with a pair of lascivious girls from a record shop scored by Rossini's 1812 Overture remains the most feverish intercourse in cinema. Inadvertently, the born-again peacekeeper has the same stomach-turning response whenever the Ode to Joy is heard. Kubrick uses the music in a remarkably accomplished way. In the early moments, we hear Ferenc Fricsay's 1958 recording with a barefaced product placement predicting the imminent social evil of fusing business and art, but when in the hospital, the music is as synthetic as his mind-blowing rehabilitation. But using the chic simulation has import on various planes: The reproduction just cannot substitute the real thing.The closest I've come to a firm grasp of the film as a whole, in terms of its production and costume design, is the notion that whatever society we would actually see in our future, unlike most futuristic films, really would be something to which we'd be stumped on how to react. Like this film's period-combining architecture and unthinkable use of color and decor, it would be hypnotic to experience, somewhat different the more we return to it and very off-putting and even at times uncomfortable in its expression of sexuality. But somehow, although the film is now 40 years old, we may not be far from a point at which all desire and interest as derived from our sex instinct, plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical, from violence to dress sense to hang-outs decorated entirely by nude mannequins that dispense milk from their genitalia to a teacher showing up at Alex's house, laying on the bed with him and grabbing his groin. It's a world that seems contradictory in those ways to mainstream society, especially in America, where we're still very uptight about sexuality outside of hetero gender-role normatives, but leave it to the visionary who brought 2001 to the screen to envisage a society devoid of many conventional inhibitions, in a story about inhibitions.",9,0,1,4 June 2011
From Hell," An Extravagantly Dark Grand Guignol Period Graphic Novel Adaptation, Unrestrained By Any Particular Target Audience
","The story of Jack the Ripper, working in the depraved and underprivileged Whitechapel district of London in 1888, shocking even by any Whitechapel benchmark of the time, has been feed for myriad movies and books, both fiction and non, and even recurring news that the case has been closed have not satisfied our curiosity. This anamorphically shot Victorian- era serial killer drama is a vivid, atmospheric work by the talented Hughes Brothers, who certainly made quite a departure from their prior string of films which included Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp.Though maybe not quite as enthralling in this as Ian Holm, Johnny Depp is creative and becoming as an opium-addicted widowed inspector whose drug-induced dreams generate clairvoyant insights into investigations. The resonance of Sherlock Holmes, another fan of the pipe, is instantly recognizable, and Al and Allen Hughes's drastic departure from 'hood tragedies provides its hero with a pushy assistant in played by Robbie Coltraine, a policeman sent to heave Depp out of the opium dens and jog his memory of his duty.Drawing a fairly dark performance even from Heather Graham, this movie is murky, dank and exhilaratingly so. The movie almost feels devious or illicit. There's a remarkable shot that begins with the city of London, cranks down past towers and trains, and plummets into a cavernous cellar where a Masonic group is sitting in judgment of one of its affiliates. You are stricken with the conception of the vigorous physical evolution of the historical metropolitan area, and the underground mechanisms of the Establishment. In an era when social morals were severe and pitiless, mischief behind closed doors was a flourishing, hot-blooded activity. Countless, maybe all, wealthy and respectable men took part in secret sin.The Hughes Brothers dive headlong into this universe, so far from their native roots and previous subject matter, embellishing and invigorating everything they depict. Their source material is graphic novel by Alan Moore, and some of their extravagant black-and-red cinematography feels influenced by modern comic book illustration, with its angry slants and angles and overstated vantage points. The production design targets garish settings, dripping wet color schemes, bottomless shadows, all painting a lavish picture of an 1880s world of subterranean corners and locales protected by the utmost evil of power and corruption.Watching the movie, I am astounded by how reliably it takes you surprise. Its charm is that it doesn't seem to cater to any particular target audience. Its comic book origins may suggest a younger male audience, but its history, as well as its use of drama much more than violence, doesn't seem made for the same folks, though its gushing blood and, literally, guts, certainly do. It is its own beast, perhaps more in the tradition of HushHush, Sweet Charlotte with a touch of surreality about a side view of an utterly nasty society, dishonored with a trickle- down effect of debauchery and ruthless self-preservation.",8,0,1,2 November 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Promising
","Reservoir Dogs is was started it all. This is a fact. The Sundance Film Festival had in 1992 what was basically Arthur C. Clarke's 2010, the year they made contact. Tarantino broke new bounds in his debut with Reservoir Dogs, Rodriguez broke new bounds in his debut with El Mariachi, Allison Anders with Gas, Food, Lodging, Gregg Araki with The Living End, Jimenez and Steinberg with The Waterdance, Tom Kalin with Swoon, Anthony Drazan with Zebrahead. The one that stuck with everyone and lingered and served as the omen for what was to become a new wave of cinema for the past 14 years was Reservoir Dogs.As much as I get sick and tired of the truly excessive worship Tarantino receives, one can never ever say his movies are bad. He is one of the few great independent filmmakers that started with a low-budget debut that was actually a truly great film. Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, two directors whose films can hardly ever be rated below 9 or 10 on this IMDb rating scale, both started off with films that weren't terribly great, and not only that, they like everyone else started off with short films and student films. Tarantino's career just started with this color, star-studded, completely un-campy, blood-soaked drama and has never once gone downhill since. The cinematography gives it the perfect look and gives off intermittent volatility, the editing very subtle even if the keenest, sharpest movie obsessive can tell when a cutaway is a cutaway and an insert is an insert. Do I think he should be mentioned as someone you can never compare to whenever a director makes a crime film? Should every other movie be deemed average or a little above because by comparison Tarantino's genius is no match? No. And I get very frustrated whenever I see instances such as these, which happens to be all the time. Nevertheless, the man is an extraordinary filmmaker, a master from the beginning, which is something you can definitely say is rare.The cast, all having been in jail at some point in their off-screen lives, is generally excellent. This is one of Keitel's best performances by a long shot. Buscemi turns in an incredibly smart performance, letting us know that he is possibly the smartest one of the whole bunch. Roth is a chameleon, always shocking us with Mr. Orange's transience. Tierney, famously the main livewire during shooting of the film, radiates that unspoken, indirectly communicated grit and spunk in only a few, mostly fairly docile scenes. While the late Penn lingers between false and passable, Madsen is the most memorable and unique. The cold, unpredictable nature of Mr. Blonde appears with the utmost effect in his performance.This being what has to be a viewing that contributes to what has to be hundreds of times I've seen it, just like most people my age and my sex, I forgot how much the film itself is a film outside conventional storytelling. It begins, as you all know, with a bunch of guys in suits, tough and cool manly men, sitting around a table in a coffee shop theorizing on the song 'Like A Virgin' and systematic tipping of waitresses. Then they leave. Then the opening credits start. Then one of them is bleeding to death in the back seat of a car being driven at a grueling pace by another of them. Our thoughts suddenly shift. The film continues in this manner. The plot unfolds in ways where our minds take hairpin turns from what we were immediately expecting and gives us something much better and much more riveting and unpredictable. Though his later films elaborate on his brilliance in writing, Reservoir Dogs remains a clear demonstration of Tarantino's shining gift for the power of the pen. He has what even most of the greatest screenwriters of all time don't have, which is a knack for never giving us what we expect and making us love it and want more no matter how extensive the running time. He also has what every great screenwriter has, and then some.",10,1,3,6 November 2006
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," One of the Most Important Things Cinema Does is Jar You, Make You Finally, After Endless Media Intake, Say, 'Wait, What the Hell Am I Watching?!?!?!'
","This film begins with four men of power, the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate, and the President, agreeing to marry each other's daughters as the initiation of a depraved ceremony. With the help of various young collaborators, they capture nine young boys and nine young girls, and take them to a château near a small town, the site of a WWII civilian massacre. Shadowing them are four middle-aged prostitutes, collaborators as well, whose activity in the depravity will be to depict aphrodisiac tales for the men of power, and who, in turn, will viciously abuse their young victims.His Excellency, the Duke, says, 'It's seeing those who don't enjoy what I do, and who suffer the worst, that provides the fascination of telling myself I'm happier than that scum they call the people.' And every unpleasant fraction is embraced and extended. The camera remains on the blood dribbling from the victims' mouths when strong-armed to ingest food filled with nails, and on the stool cover their lips when forced to eat feces, which their captors gladly eat.I don't think I have ever seen such relentlessly stomach-turning content, let alone comparable content done with such poise and sophistication. There is such rich, vibrant color, it is set in a tremendous palace, and we are affronted by the calming white of the chapter headings. The film takes place during the WWII occupations, but we forget all about that until one arbitrary moment when a plane, ostensibly a fighter jet, flies above the storyteller's window. She observes briefly, then it's out of her head again. The actors don't play at all like they are in a tragedy. They all seem so indifferent. The film feels designed to show not the joy of sexual perversions but, instead, the objectification and exteriorization of the body in the unnatural social macrocosm imposed by neocapitalism.Pasolini's libertines are neither de Sade's blue-bloods nor a Romantic-era novelist's diabolical protagonists who confront their culture but calculating, monstrous government officials who are driven by resentment and ineffectuality rather than lust. As for their nude and acquiescent sufferers, they are no more than exchangeable and undesignated objects. The palatial manor where the libertines indulge their unflappable sadistic games and mishmashes is less a domain of pleasure than an inescapable death camp.The title isn't giving you a choice in what to formally call the movie. It's vital to Pasolini's message that the title be Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom. Oddly, the key word is 'or.' By placing de Sade's most notorious work, or anything imagined by the Marquis de Sade, in the Republic of Salò, the short-lived puppet state of Nazi Germany who staged Mussolini as leader, Pasolini screams a correlation between the dreamt-up cruelty of the libertines and the actual occurrence of Italian Fascism. Pasolini spent some of his early twenties in the Saló Republic. There, he witnessed a considerable myriad barbarities of the Fascist collaborationist forces. But this analogy does not rule out most other political and corporate machines. One doesn't have to be as patient during the film as one would think in order to see that it's not an exploitation film but an everlasting argument against the anarchy of power. Power provides such decadence and self-indulgence that life can truly but nothing but a banquet. Note the unspeakably horrific, deeply troubling ending, which not only takes the cake concerning the film's torture, gore and violence but juxtaposes it with the smugness, blindness, and desensitization of the masses. This film could easily be a metaphor for ENRON, the Bush administration, any dictatorship, Darfur, ad infinitum.I'm unsure of whether I could see this film more than once. I may be able to see it again a long time from now. But isn't that a good thing? One of the most important things cinema does is jar you, make you finally, after endless media intake, say, 'Wait, what the hell am I watching?!?!?!' I feel as if I've truly seen just how far cinema has ever gone in a particular direction. Amidst all the satires, sociopolitical commentaries, horror films or controversial cult films that have come since 1975, I don't believe any, no matter how superior in entertainment quality they are, no matter the brilliance and importance of their makers may be, have branded such an artistic scar on the common notions of the controlling human world, explored as much that is not said by accustomed depictions, exposed as much that is disremembered in social and cultural agreement. There may not be another work of cinema available that better enacts such a provocation to common depictions, to social and cultural agreement, than does this cinematic torture device.",8,5,8,15 February 2009
Total Recall," A Classic 1990s Action Pic, Perfect To Watch Stoned
","By now, Total Recall is one of those classic action flicks we've seen a million times on TV, but we overlook Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance, judging it as nothing more than action hero presence and not really acting. But Ahnuld is one of the reasons the movie works. He isn't a hulking superman, although he incidentally fights like one. He's a baffled and alarmed guy, deceived by the edifice of reality. And in his susceptibility, he opens the way for this hilarious and ultraviolent Philip K. Dick adaptation to be more than simply a violence and special effects run-around, although the latter half conforms to such.There are loads of action and violence in Total Recall, which frankly would be the perfect movie to watch stoned, and practically every frame appears to inhabit one or more special effects. This is one of the most multifaceted and visually attention-grabbing sci-fi movies even still, in spite of how heavily dated it is now. What would happen to one's mental purity of essence if it were possible to be equipped with memories? If your whole past could be plugged into your brain, taking the place of the experiences through which you had really lived, up till that very moment unashamed for having treasured the things akin to those lacks and wants that caused you to do the things you have done? That's what looks as if to happen to Quaid, the Schwarzenegger character in Total Recall, which should have kept Dick's original title, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, while periodically neither Quaid nor we can be certain. As he did with RoboCop, Paul Verhoeven creates a desensitized and cynical future, where Quaid lives with his curvy blonde Sharon Stone wife, and works in construction. His life gives a pleasant impression, but he keeps having these violent dreams about Mars that ultimately move him to sign up with a controversial travel agency that endows you with the memory of the perfect vacation as opposed to all the work of achieving a perfect real one.But is this a packaged memory, or a real experience? The movie plays tantalizing mind games with the likelihood, pivotally in a great scene where a doctor and Quaid's Sharon Stone seem to appear out of thin air to convince him of one of the possibilities. Mars is in the middle of a revolutionary war between the forces of a greedy, power-drunk captain of industry, played with great comic book-style verve by Ronny Cox just as he did in Verhoeven's RoboCop, and a group of rebels. There is a mystery involving a huge reactor that was ostensibly assembled by aliens on Mars a million years ago, and has been discovered during mining operations. And can the sexy Rachel Ticotin trust Quaid, who doesn't know that they were lovers some time ago? Total Recall moves from side to side among different translations and planes of reality, whereas all at once filling to the brim with fertile details of a messed up future.I am baffled by the thought that in the future, firearms of all kinds would not be outlawed inside an airtight glass shell like the one in which Earthlings must remain on Mars. There are to be sure quite a lot of moments in which people are sucked outside when the air seal is shattered, but that doesn't stop the movie's villains from never hitting their target, or for that matter the good guys from ever missing theirs.But one can argue that the gaping inconsistencies in this quintessentially 1990s Schwarzenegger picture are on purpose, because the science depicted is laughable all the way through, and right from the start. At many points in the movie, characters wind up outside on Mars, and right away begin to inflate, their eyes popping and their faces ballooning. This is just an example. And from a good deal of what I have seen of Verhoeven's work, such as The Fourth Man, RoboCop and Starship Troopers, he knew how silly this was, and cynically satirized the action adventure tradition's cavalier approach to realism, mortality and violence, which frankly is preferable over an action picture with these approaches that takes itself seriously.",8,0,2,28 October 2008
Rocky," An Involving Movie In the Face of Its Otherwise Hackneyed Substance
","American cinema in the 1970s was marked by the new generation of filmmakers' bombshell of originality, liveliness, sexuality and a fervor for the artistic importance of film itself, with a pervading emphasis on realism, subversive political themes and sexual candor. But what won Best Picture in the year of Taxi Driver, Network and All the President's Men---the legendary arguable masterpieces of three of contemporary cinema's finest directors---is this paint-by-numbers inspirational sports flick. Stallone's screenplay is the most wholesome 1930s Hollywood fantasy. It's the tale of Rocky and his girl Adrian, when he, because of conditions too irrational to go into, is given the chance to fight the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, fashioned after Muhammad Ali so sketchily as to be a practically senseless misuse of character. It's not sufficient enough to even be defamation, but by making the Ali-like fighter such a garish fool, the film treads regions of undeveloped racism that might not be all that undeveloped.There are intermittent twinklings that the film may be condescending to the subordinate end of the proletarian attitude, as much if not more than the characters who continue putting Rocky down, like Gazzo's bodyguard and the (black) boxer who taunts Rocky after usurping his locker. Then again, Avildsen is known for creating such indistinctness with films he made before such as Joe---which dealt with what mainstream film hadn't yet dared about the neutral depiction of overt racists, junkies and gritty urban living---and the great Save the Tiger, which punctured stereotypes and sought longingly and urgently for answers to the seeming moral predicaments of modern times. Rocky is a devolution of that thread.However, there are some extremely fine actors in other supporting parts. Burt Young is convincing as Rocky's best friend, a drunk jerk, as is a both deservedly Oscar-nominated and very underused Burgess Meredith as Rocky's antiquated trainer. It's actually Shire who comes off the best, Coppola's sister and Connie in his Godfather saga. She's a genuine actress, truly moving and also droll as a budding bachelorette who comes behind schedule to sexual life. She's so effective, actually, that she almost adds credence to Stallone's performance, which is frankly way too goofy. (I keep getting the impulse to mock him out loud in that mongoloid exaggeration of Italian-American brute brogue.) So Rocky, by day, is a petty debt collector for a neighborhood loan shark played by Joe Spinell. Rocky's the kind of character who evinces his genuine compassion by thinking twice about breaking a stakeholder's thumb. At night, as we all by now very well know, chases a substandard boxing career in rundown sporting rings. But consider when Shire sits, crying and furrowed, in a corner of her small bedroom. Her brother has wrecked the living room with a baseball bat. Rocky, the guy she has become smitten by, enters. She timidly asks him if he wants a roommate. 'Absolutely,' he says, which is precisely what he should say, and how he should say it, and why Rocky is such an involving movie despite its otherwise ultimately stale framework.",7,2,3,6 May 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," When You Look in the Mirror, Do You See Yourself as You Really Are or Only Your Appearance?
","Viewed by some as a psychosexual thriller, some as a bitter comedy about how Tom Cruise falls short of getting laid, this is most likely neither, a cerebral film that works on various planes, imaginary, physical, transcendental and everything that falls in between. A hypnotic, thematically perceptive, sumptuously atmospheric, merely every so often bothersome piece, an intensely challenging consideration of the limits of faith, certainty and shared understanding possible between man and woman, Cruise's scenes with Nicole Kidman provide an intimacy hitherto absent from Kubrick's work. From the mirror love scene, played with a carnal sweetness rare for the screen, to the vulnerability and apprehension of their ultimate talk, Cruise and Kidman are frank, emotive, despite that the movie definitely follows Kubrick's thread of mysterious films with emotionally remote characters.Actors are in an remorseless existential whirl. A good performance only tends to happen if they let go. Ironically the yearning to perform well and feel this free expression can trap them into holding on, reserving a corner of their focus so they can monitor and direct their performance, which makes all likelihood for a vibrant, natural performance recede. That's why many actors don't communicate their methods, superstitious about exposing such cavernous ideas to the outside. I think Kubrick was the same way with his technique. And that's why I feel that Cruise and Kidman don't seem like Maverick and Nicola; they mesh in Kubrick's world. They are in synch.Yet the real star of this movie is Kubrick himself, who, precisely in character, gives meticulous heed to each self-contained scene. He makes a conscious decision not to weave them into a progressing narrative, but to make each one an objective in itself, giving each confrontation the ferment of a dream in which the present is lucid but it's difficult to recall where we've come from, project what could come next. It's as close as many films ever come to being pure: It's so intent on what it's about that even logical narrative form isn't allowed to take precedence over what it's about, which is something as basic and universal as a confession of sexual longing. It's purely, yes, a stream of fidelity, jealousy, and dream logic channeled through an array of sub-Freudian motifs.No one acquainted with the distant meticulousness of Kubrick's work will be surprised that this isn't the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis might convey. The eerily stately air of sexual melancholy and claustrophobia which permeates the film finds its focal point during an elaborate masked orgy, which may or may not place Cruise in mortal danger. Yet there's an underlying subtlety to the film which takes care to provide all manner of visual and thematic echoes, accommodating the blurring of perceptual distinctions hinted in the title.Each of these scenes is like an interior monologue-heavy chapter in a novel. They move at a slower pace to allow a more intimate look into Cruise's inner life, for him to digest actions, events and epiphanies, he interacts with himself and the settings more than with other characters, and they never feel time-based. They're thoughts, basically. They're free-floating. Everything's a projection of a feeling or notion. It's a beguiling metaphysical experience of overhearing a person's private thoughts, as they're alternately externalized and internalized.Throughout the shooting of all Kubrick's most important works, he constantly sought the most authentic ambiance or 'feel' for each, and this personally controlled, visually enticing enterprise has a thriller's framework, with the prospects of intrigue and murder. It also strikes one like an infernal delusion; a sequence of odd characters flicker in and out of the limelight, baffling the hero with obscure fine points of their lives. The compromise at the end of the film is the one scene that doesn't quite come off; a film that captivates us owing to its undecided issues shouldn't attempt to bring in the bubble wrap. But that's why Eyes Wide Shut is a consummate film in its famously headstrong director's canon, because it both classically exemplifies his power as a filmmaker and showcases his weaknesses, which compared to most filmmakers in history are showcases of pure talent.I don't think the point is to be able to pass a test on it when it's over, but to nonetheless become completely absorbed. Implicating the audience in the act of coveting, Kubrick's accomplishment here is sustaining a weird, off-putting, somehow sensual pitch for the doctor's oddball confrontations. Shooting with a grainy high-contrast approach, lots of back-lighting, underlighting and intense primary colors, setting the film at Christmastime to benefit from the lights, he makes it all rather ornate, like an urban festival. Cruise isn't exactly the protagonist but the character being compelled, tilting from one scenario to another.The grace, appearance of impulsiveness continually surprise, invigorate, and the horizontalization of space, emotion cement this banquet of technique, Freudian incisiveness and personal audacity as---despite minor but uncharacteristic compromises by Kubrick to secure a mainstream release---an affront to the Hollywood game, a declaration of its maker's independence. When this came out a few months after Kubrick's death, it was seriously misread, which should've come as no shock. If you retread, examine the initial responses to any Kubrick film, except the earliest ones, you'll see that all of them were. Then, after five, ten years came the dawning that 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon were each like nothing else before or since. So is Eyes Wide Shut.",8,0,1,12 October 2010
The Descent," Some Places Just Aren't For Humans
","Neil Marshall's sophomore effort, The Descent, is a savage work that rattles your nerves. Most blood and guts movies today are made essentially for the indiscriminate teen devotees. This is an effective vision of the horror genre. It follows a caving expedition upon which a group of perfectly fit women embark, but it's also a metaphorical plunge into the deep hole where deep fears and true terror are brought to fruition, a descent into primitive anarchy and insanity.The squirm-inducingly snug canals and hollow cracks within the earth, occasionally given light by pinkish flares, make these characters drain the capacity of their bodies, their relationships, and their basic beliefs about themselves.Yes, there's a main character, who has undergone a horrible tragedy and needs to be revitalized if she's ever going to survive her depression. The American friend in the close group of adventurous friends is Juno, the daring, fly-by-night instigator of this trip into cavernous Appalachia. There's a little more character development for the first thirty, forty minutes, but really it is just the movie winding up. I have a hard time getting into it at the start; because Marshall does not have an urge to tell the story of these women as individuals but as a collective social circle, I find it difficult to tell them apart. But where the movie comes alive is in the murky, claustrophobic world beneath the scenic facade of the mountains, where the women soon discover there's no way out of this cave but through ithopefully.Marshall has a way with darkness, too. It can be burdensome, crushing, as when the majority of the screen is black, surrounding a small hole depicting a rock tunnel, and thus we realize that we are the ones who desperately want to see the characters reach daylight again. Even when their flashlights illuminate a good portion of their dominant, overwhelming surroundings, there is a terrorizing barrenness, a space to be satisfied because of the natural restlessness and paranoia brought on by the situation, fulfilled by dangers and trouble, both real and conjured up. These quick-witted visual compositions create an atmosphere of tension and dread that you can cut with a pairing knife.",8,0,1,28 October 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Fine Commercial and Social Product
","Gone With the Wind was another literary phenomenon that produced a film rendering that had to meet equally exacting fan qualifications. It's comparable in the sense that everyone had an attitude about the casting, which in due course resulted wonderfully. The novelists required a loyalty to the manuscript, which was respected. Directors were enlisted who could be relied upon to deferentially work for the material. Immeasurable arithmetic was done while constructing the corporal worlds of the novels. Producers challenged standard constraints about running time to incorporate all the indispensable narrative episodes.On a hushed suburban London street, owls emerge, a cat transforms into Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltraine relinquishes a bundled infant to a doorstep. Harry Potter, an urchin who keeps extraordinarily buoyant despite the never-ending bitterness and cruelty allotted by the intolerant aunt and uncle with whom he's been left, is kept in a cubbyhole, tormented by his browbeating cousin, forbidden from opening the officially addressed envelopes that inexplicably begin arriving for him. The relatives are stunned when the same leviathan, Hagrid, arrives on Harry's 11th birthday to notify him that he's indeed the son of two slain wizards and is now welcome to grace Hogwarts. Very smartly, this is all done with tongue lodged in cheek and rewarded by temporary comeuppance.The reason this near-ideal product holds up so well from age ten to twenty owes to its humor, its light-hearted youthful nature, though it's clear that Chris Columbus cuts and arranges his camera very capriciously and isn't the ideal filmmaker for staging action dramatically or developing with deliberate accent, depending instead on FX and John Williams' tiringly hectic score to punch up crucial moments. Nevertheless, it's all on the right tonal level, as we're absconded into a world immortalized to an unusually engaging extent by production design, locations, effects and actors. The key, naturally, is Radcliffe. Young Daniel's standard facial appearance, unkempt dark hair, sheer eyes, round spectacles make an instantaneously adorable Harry. He's an average underdog whose continuing comprehension of his uncommon power I believe.When, at 40 minutes in, the school is finally seen, kids paddling across a lake at night toward its soaring spires on a bastion-style outcrop, the film establishes a sought-after atmosphere of marvel and mystery about what lies ahead. Maggie Smith recurs as Professor McGonagall, who heads the much-repeated 'sorting' of students arbitrated in the immense Great Hall by a pleasant talking hat. Harry, Weasley and Hermione wind up together in Gryffindor, while their little arch-rival Malfoy is allocated to Slytherin, where Alan Rickman's ham-handedly fearsome Professor Snape rules. Mysteriously, a feast materializes on the endless tables, ghosts gracefully flutter around, paintings are flesh, stairways reposition unexpectedly.Throughout a decidedly action-packed school year, it appears someone wicked is scheming to purloin the eponymous Stone for Voldemort, a matchless wizard who's been without power since he slaughtered Harry's parents but couldn't quite dispose of the child. The stone lies beyond a trap door fortified by a massive three-headed dog absurdly named Fluffy. In a jam-packed chain of events from such highlights as Harry's night-time rovings in his invisibility cloak and seeing his late parents in a conjuring mirror to eluding Fluffy into a full-scale chessboard, the young threesome has its nerve and cleverness weathered to the utmost in a clash of obvious good versus evil, though the chess match alas underscores violence over suspense.Harry's found to be so skillful at piloting a broomstick that he's made star player on Gryffindor's team in Quidditch, a staggeringly unsafe sport that has its pre-pubescent players hundreds of feet above an arena on brooms in frantic pursuit of very hard high-speed balls. The airborne element is excellently achieved visually, but the Quidditch match itself is one sequence that indulges speed with suspense and loudness with excitement without the support of narrative motion.Regardless, the cast recompenses flat out, especially the sweetly extroverted Emma Watson as the prying, sharp-witted Hermione, and Rupert Grint, whose Weasley grows charmingly from a perfectly nebbishy second-banana comic foil into indispensable sidekick. On the grown-up front, Coltrane is foremost among contemporaries, yet it's no revelation how superlatively such authorities as Smith, Rickman, John Hurt, Richard Harris as the white-maned Dumbledore, Ian Hart as the enigmatic Quirrell and Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw as the nervously conventional Dursleys are brilliant.By and large, the vast effects are exceptional and pleasing. Some of the creature work, like the centaur, even calls to mind Harryhausen's pioneering stop-motion. The costumes are another spring for repeated amusement, while John Seale's widescreen lensing substantially proliferates everything across the screen. If all movies acquisitively allocated as cinematic franchises could be as spotlessly considered as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, there'd be no incentive to lament cinema's asinine commodification.",8,0,1,18 May 2011
Thor," A Darwinian Superman II with Big Laughs
","Nearly half of Thor is set in Asgard, one of the universe's nine 'realms,' which is reigned over by King Odin. Thor is Odin's oldest son and is therefore entitled to the throne, but he's foolhardy, bigheaded and impetuous, which is why he heads a group of fighters in an anticipatory assault against Asgard's foes, the Frost Giants. For this, Odin takes away Thor's power, which comes from his magical hammer, and expels him to Earth, where he's accommodated by Natalie Portman, in her third decidedly unambitious screen role since her success with Black Swan, an astrophysicist who's in the infancy of hypothesizing the very universal trapdoor through which Thor just came. The biggest shock is that the film is most effective and involving where you would least expect it. One would think that Branagh would do more with the film's unsmiling supernatural constituents and probably labor over its more down-to-earth relief stretches, yet it's precisely the opposite.The tone is unexpectedly good-humored. Baffled as to who he is, Jane imagines that Thor might be extraterrestrial, although her partner Stellan Skarsgård is dubious because all the words and names that Thor uses are recognizable to him from his Scandinavian background. Nonetheless, they wind up helping him in his pursuit to reclaim the hammer, albeit double-super-secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, known from the Iron Man movies, has located it already. Meanwhile, back in Asgard, Thor's younger brother Loki, who initially seemed to be a level-headed sounding board, is scheming behind Thor's back to guarantee that his exile is eternal and he inherits the kingdom. Given Branagh's qualifications in Shakespeare and literary adaptations, one would assume that the royal and familial plot on Asgard would be the film's highlights, but these scenes are indeed very tedious, and occasionally fairly stilted.Maybe it's due to all the digital sets and backdrops, which are lavishly accomplished but never quite seem palpable, not to mention a whole 'nother century of cinema's worth of dutch angles. Where Branagh genuinely enlivens the film is on Earth, where a light-hearted and even cleverly hilarious streak offsets the take-me-serious histrionic matters. The first half hour of this silly movie is indeed a drag as it's too sanctimonious, but once Thor discovers himself in the deserts of New Mexico, it's priceless, and all the more so as it's so unexpected, to see these very relatable mere mortals look on while he speaks in some sort of imitation-medieval English. 'I need sustenance!' he proclaims at a small-town diner, shortly before smashing his coffee cup on the floor. And eventually he grasps, rather hilariously, that he's no longer as mighty as he was before, his schooling in modesty and logic assume a valid emotional concentration.Thor, a prince in any case, is chivalrous and reverential of women, but also a hard-drinking, giant-slaughtering conqueror once deified by Vikings. We find ourselves regularly laughing with the movie, for instance at the way he reacts to doctors attempting to take his blood, or how he asks for that second cup of coffee at breakfast. Still, where the movie loses my interest is in that faraway dimension, where the set design's tawdry golden flash envelops the quarrels of the gods---essentially, the swarthy conspirator against the heroic Aryan---comes across as an incessant, uninflected one-note huff. Kat Dennings as Portman's friend discharges some well-delivered lines and then practically evaporates, beautiful bosom and all, but on Asgard, Rene Russo, as Odin's wife-slash-Thor's mother, has one line and nothing else to do.Thankfully, the Shakespearean at the helm manages to inculcate a taste of the Bard's irony. Speaking of which, just because Loki's a hackneyed character doesn't mean young British actor Tom Hiddleston wouldn't make a first-rate Edmund in King Lear: He's better at relating his resentment and jealousy than any evil or wickedness. Thor boils down to nothing more than big laughs, loud and tacky Hollywood action, and a hero who requires suffering the loss of his might before he can truly be mighty. It's a lesser installment in the superhero adaptation bubble, but one that is wonderfully entertaining on its own restricted conditions.",7,2,4,10 September 2011
Three Colors: Blue," A Study of Dissociated, Interior Conscience, Thus Blue
","Juliette Binoche is impressively becoming in her role as a woman whose husband and child are killed in a car accident within the first five minutes of the movie. Then proceeds a story that we imagine must be about how she wrestles with her loss, but as she is abruptly set free from the connection of family, Julie attempts to fortify herself from everyone in her life and live in isolation from those former ties. However, she finds herself making new connections she can't seem to help but make. What a beautiful capture of humanity that is. Many of us would love to take advantage of a golden, if heartbreaking, opportunity to sever all ties. Yet the film presents a profound question: To what extent do we need human contact? Is it something even the most walled-off of us can do without?Blue is the perfect color for such a subject. It's a moody, quiet color that evokes water, which complements emotion in many ways. Kieslowski has made such a personal film, such a deeply personal insight which feels like, for him, it was bold. He parades proudly his telling story with a theme of powerful music.",8,0,0,12 February 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Coppola Must Run on Frantic Drama, Frustration, Violence and Seemingly Nothing Else In His Life To Make a Great Film
","The third chapter in this everlasting series of films is certainly the saddest of the trilogy, because as well as being an impression of characterizations and events from mob history, such as mob-related conspiracy behind the death of Pope John Paul I and Joey Zasa (played entertainingly by Joe Mantegna) being a creatively ironic amalgam of two real-life gangsters who hated each other, it is also a study of Michael Corleone, now a middle-aged man who did not foresee such regret and remorse for his ruthless conquests in the previous films. In his attempts to use the wealth and power he has gained from those bloody triumphs, he tries to cleanse his family name, under the quietly desperate delusion that it is not an exercise in futility. For if it were not, there would be no opposition for his extensive criminal history to the landmark international real estate deal he works to seal. Nor would his old New York partners want in on the deal, an affair that tips the first domino in a succession of violence, betrayal, and scandal amongst the highest of statuses (stati?).Though there was great reluctance from Coppola to make a third installment, which was greenlit for the sake of understandably anticipated box office returns, it becomes an important part of the story of the Corleone family, even if it does not measure up to its two immortal predecessors. We see the modern effects of the conservation of the preceding generations. Michael suffers for his father's legacy, and Michael's stubbornness to preserve his own, though it has grown weather-beaten by the time during which the film takes place, has created a barrier of communication between himself and his wife and children, a classic senior having planned a much different future than he's received. Even Talia Shire's character, Connie, Michael's sister, is a completely different person in this movie than she was in the last. It is not a poor characterization but a very realistic one, as a woman from that generation who has resigned herself to the life into which she was born. There is no mention from her of Michael's order of her husband's death, for instance. She is not the meek, vulnerable soul she was before but astonishingly transformed into a highly competent adviser to her brother.However, even despite Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana being a cherry on top of the most beautiful musical theme in the history of film, the movie is inarguably the weakest of the three Godfather films. There is hardly a way of defending the idea that it surpasses or even equals its predecessors, which in the case of both had such a distinctly powerful touch not only at the helm but in the case of all departments. Here, the dialogue is weak with typical final-chapter-in-American-trilogy visibly scripted wisdom. I also have a hard time understanding why Andy Garcia, a Cuban, was cast as an Italian when so many hot-blooded young Italian actors could have played that role just as well as he did. Those are flaws some can accept and others have a difficult time accepting, and one cannot complain directly about Garcia's performance. (Besides, his father Sonny was played by James Caan and his grandfather by Marlon Brando, neither of whom are Italian.) The inextricable misnomer is one of the most well-known in contemporary cinema history, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Mary, Michael's daughter. I will not plunge into criticism because I know the poor girl suffered quite enough at the time, what with the Razzie awards, countless notices, and other such humiliating things. I am glad she was able to redeem herself by becoming a director like her father, a completely different style all her own, not plainly influenced by Francis, an unaffected subtlety as opposed to his inherent need to outdo himself, which brings me to another thought on this film's weakness.The Godfather Part III, now that I've rewatched it as a grown person and refreshed my memory and understanding of it, has supplied me with a theory as to the striking inconsistency in Coppola's filmography. In the 1970s, he made the first two Godfathers and Apocalypse Now, showered with giant personal, political, and artistic obstacles that in some cases almost literally destroyed him. The Conversation was made entirely from scratch. These films are his great works. After Apocalypse Now, the quality of his films took a major nosedive and even now, as he has recently returned to the director's chair with Youth Without Youth, he cannot seem to regain his aim. Godfather III is very telling. In comparison to the danger, conflicts and drama throughout the first two productions, Part III was a walk in the park. He had to fight for those films and that passion is what made them so incredible. Part III was handed to him, and because it was the other way around entirely, he had a hard time committing to the project, thus the film is clearly made with much less ardor and feeling, though the set design and atmosphere are still not one ounce short of top-notch. Coppola must run on frantic drama, frustration, violence and seemingly nothing else to make a great film. However, considering the relatively peaceful circumstances of Part III's production, he succeeded to a good extent.",8,2,4,2 October 2008
The Fountain," Death: A Rebirth
","Familiar of course with Pi and Requiem For A Dream, I knew that when I saw The Fountain I would be taken aback by the inventiveness and talent in the film-making itself, and I was. It has very progressive and interesting cinematography, with lots of gold in the theme of the lighting, which movies rarely have and this happens to have in nearly every seen. The editing was, as in Requiem, intensely complex, infusing the sharp images of reality as we know it with abstract sequences involving the Tree of Life and the nebula that surrounds it. The musical score gives the film such drama and emotional drive, even if it's only a hint of the power that it had in Requiem. The story, however, could just be either something way ahead of its time or way ahead of itself.The Fountain is a movie that cannot explain itself, so it's created in a way relative to an impressionist painting. You'll find that you're asking yourself questions about the story, like stories by their very nature provoke you to do, but they tend to be qusetions that you feel you've either missed the answer to or don't quite understand the answer to. I'm not panning the film for its intricacy. It's very possible that it has a profound point at the doorstep of the answers to all of the questions you'll find yourself asking yourself about the story. And it does provoke thought. For instance, the tagline for the movie is, 'What if you could live forever?' During it, you surprisingly end up seriously asking yourself that. What if you could? What would you do? But the film requires such concentration and patience and the subsequent pondering after seeing it, and after several 'avant-garde' and 'post-modernist' and 'neo-realist' filmmakers have opened so many brain-rattling discussions over so many films that they strategically claim later to have meant basically nothing so that they could look down on their audience as patsies, the victims of their time and age, I grow suspicious when a film is so cryptic that by the end, the plot hasn't even entirely revealed itself at face value yet.As for Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the two leads that replaced Brad Pitt and Jennifer Connelly, are very impressive, Jackman being one of the great cryers of recent cinema and Weisz being so evasively good at absorbing your sympathy. Burstyn is wasted, her character a token.",7,0,1,3 December 2006
Mystic River," 'Maybe Some Day You Forget What It's Like to be Human and Maybe Then, It's OK.'
","Clint Eastwood's powerful comeback as director, continuing one of American cinema's most extensive and most intriguing observations of masculinity, Mystic River is a gloomy, foreboding scowl about a present-day crime internally connected to a past crime. It concerns three boyhood friends in an Irish Boston neighborhood, who were eternally scarred when one of them was snatched by a child molester. As men, their lives have quelled into uptight daily grinds that are disturbed by the freshest emotionally cataclysmic crime. Written by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, the movie features a league of phenomenal actors adept at unearthing genuine human feelings in a plot that could've been a thriller if its gaze weren't so much more grave, if it didn't summon so much authentic anguish.The film focuses on the three friends: Jimmy, now an ex-con running the corner store; Dave, a working stiff, and Sean, a homicide detective. All are married; Jimmy to a second wife, Annabeth, who helps raise his oldest daughter and two of their own; Dave to Celeste, who's given him a son; Sean to an AWOL pregnant wife who calls him now and then yet never says anything. The other prominent character is Whitey, Sean's partner. Jimmy watches like a hawk his 19-year-old daughter Katie, who works with him at the store. She's in love with Brendan. Theirs is a sugary flame. Jimmy bitterly objects. They plot to run away together. Alas, before that can happen Katie's discovered mangled and dead. Sean and Whitey are assigned to the case. Brendan is of course a suspect, but so is Dave, who came home late that night, spattered with blood, talking to his wife in distress about a mugger he resisted, may have killed.While major aspects of Mystic River work in keeping with the style of a police procedural, it's about more than the mere yes-or-no answer of blame, though Jimmy claims he will murder the person who murdered his daughter, and we have no cause to question him, mainly after he enlists neighborhood goons to lead their own investigation. It's about anguish descending through the decades, about unuttered closet skeletons, silent distrust. And it's very much about the individual honor of husbands and wives. Annabeth has a scene where she identifies with Jimmy's compulsion for revenge, and it's not far-fetched to parallel her character to Lady Macbeth. Celeste gradually starts to suspect Dave's story about the mugger and communicates her suspicions. We see one wife brutally allegiant, another who feels she has been excluded from some abysmal cell of her husband's heart.While the plot ultimately reaches a definite resolution, it's not about the resolution. It's about the venture there. It supplies each of its actors with scenes that measure their boundaries. Both Penn and Robbins generate desperate and stunning tension as they are interrogated by the police. Most memorable is their first man-to-man talk in years after Katie's death. There's a definite strand of suspense between Whitey, who believes Dave clearly responsible, and Sean, who's disinclined to doubt a childhood friend. There are such abysmal lagoons of bitterness and murderous feelings surrounding the funeral that we anticipate an eruption at any instant, but the simmering of the characters is all deep-seated. And forever that day in the past drifts as a voice from their collective past. Compounding Dave's agony was the apprehension the other two boys always had about him. Perhaps they didn't completely grasp what happened to him---how could they?---but somehow they no longer felt the same about their defiled friend, a life arrested in midstream.Penn's performance is one of the unequivocal engravings of the apex of a realist masculine tradition that engendered Brando, Dean, Pacino, De Niro. He has rid his technique of any breath of staginess or window dressing while absorbing all the straightforwardness and power that the Method's brought into American movies. Bacon, flirting with apathy, is excellent, as is Fishburne, whose drollery and questioning keep us from being submerged in the dark. Whitey's the one main character who's not associated with the insulated lineage of the neighborhood, and his wisecracks and seasoned comments are in some sense visitations from the outside world. Robbins, in some ways, confronts the ultimate assignment because he must play a man whose violated identity is an erratic composite of emotional nakedness and ferocity, innocence and deception. We feel crushingly, unfathomably sorry for him, but he puts others off, including Marcia Gay Harden, who as Celeste gives the film its most disconcerting portrait of horror and despair, just as Laura Linney, as Annabeth, arising from the abyss later on, expresses with devastating certainty the viciousness that functions as justice in their collapsed domain.This is Clint Eastwood's 24th film as director, and one of the handful of them where he doesn't also cast himself. He asserts here a full-toned unity with the characters and their actors, who are given wounding moments of truth. Invariably a downplaying actor himself, he unearths in his three actors watersheds of solitude and repression. Robbins grieves within his own despair, watches vampire movies on TV to identify analogies for his state of mind. Bacon aches all the time due to the void his wife has left. Penn's a brutal man who fixes to react brutally but has not, we see, found much relief that way in the past. To see potent acting like this is invigorating and breathtaking. It's vital to be continually reminded that movies can see, hear and conscientiously relate to their characters. Directors reach the top drawer by withholding, not embellishing: Eastwood does nothing for ornament, everything for impact.",10,1,2,13 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Both Much of What is Right and Much of What is Wrong with the First Movie is also Present Here
","As luck would have it, Chamber of Secrets has more of a story sweep than its forerunner, though it lacks much determination or tension. But, most importantly, it does preserve the light-hearted sense of humor and childlike buoyancy that made the first film entertaining. The humor is slightly on the mawkish side this time, and Columbus hasn't decided against tacking on another winning-is-good wrap-up, this time even more peppered with honey-baked schmaltz than last time, but the light-hearted youthful nature of the material is still intact and keeps it engaging even for those of us who haven't seen it in nearly ten years.This second annual production design festival starts with Harry reuniting with Hermione and Ron, and his arch-rival, Tom Felton's Draco, as they prepare for sophomore year at Hogwarts. Many of the old faculty return, including Dumbledore, the stringent McGonagall, and the gloomy, hostile Snape. There's a new recruit, a totally engaging Kenneth Branagh as the charming, narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart, who is more engrossed in fan mail than teaching defense against the dark arts. But all's not sound at Hogwarts. A sinister conspiracy is looming, with someone plotting to burglarize the renowned Chamber of Secrets and let loose a monster. It's up to Harry and his mates to expose the perpetrator before Hogwarts finishes.All real inspiration motivating this hat-in-hand outing is rooted in Rowling's original ideas. The Harry Potter stories don't break new ground, but they merge time-honored fantasy blueprints into a breezy, creative and contagious concoction, but Columbus isn't poised to make any real leaps with the material, and periodically this suit-following sequel seems more like processed merchandise than a live, three-dimensional film. It pleases, meets expectations, but doesn't blow one's mind.All of the unforgettable moments happen in the powerfully dynamic latter half of the movie, including an staggeringly accomplished gathering of giant, inhospitable spiders and a likewise arresting encounter with a massive snake. These scenes, with their perfect virtual worlds and graphic effects, minify even the most imposing sequence from the first movie. The film's other significant effect is Dobby the computer-generated House Elf, who at once manages to be little more compelling and a little less grating than Jar-Jar Binks, sans minstrelsy.Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are more self-possessed and practiced than in their previous excursion, especially Grint, who has settled impeccably into the role of the more hapless, more neurotic comic relief. Branagh had been below the radar in the past few years. It's refreshing to see him burst back into the public interest with something this pleasant. The other noteworthy add-on is Jason Isaacs, who admits emits unadulterated wickedness, as Draco's father, Lucius.Indeed, much of what made the first film so charming stays resolutely primed, from the strapping ensemble performances to Stuart Craig's impressive production design. The atmosphere of invention, that early interface with the stories' vibrant characters and quirky corresponding world, is absent. In its place comes frenetic commotion. As companion pieces, Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets interlock perfectly. Not shocking, bearing in mind that many of the same people were responsible for both.",7,0,0,21 May 2011
The Departed," Who Can You Trust In This World?
","Possibly the greatest remake of all time, ripe, multi-layered and entirely its own beast, The Departed is a swarthy, vigorous and masculine film about two men trying to live social lives that are the fundamental antitheses of their internal sensibilities. Their efforts loom to undo them, either by breakdown or lethal revelation. The unfolding of their stories concerns an ethical maze, in which good and evil don each other's camouflage. It's not what it's about but how it's about it, which is invariably concordant with a Martin Scorsese film.A densely cached, morbidly hilarious and powerfully dramatic magnum opus of its genre, The Departed is set in Boston instead of, well, New York, L.A., Las Vegas. It starts with a soda fountain scene that would fit perfectly in GoodFellas. What is nonetheless purposefully missing is the basic luxury of that film. Rather than a kid who lusts after growing up to be a mobster, we have two kids who ripen as frauds: One becomes a cop who goes undercover as a gangster, and the other vice versa. Both men excel their phony personas. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan create sympathy and levels of histrionics in the film's early scenes by showing the 'bad guy' mingle with top officials while the 'good guy' is abused by top officials, the former procuring a high-class condo with a view from the top while the latter's family disintegrates. The plot's white-knuckled impact relies on frail humanity. After several years, both men come to relate to, and crave the respect of, the men they are misleading. There are implicit father-son relationships all over this film, every single male character being both father and son to another to some degree. And the scenario ties the extra knot of each man being validated by just one or two of the men on the side he's benefitting. If DiCaprio's boss dies, who can corroborate that he is actually a cop? Cunningly descriptive tiers of this safe deposit are fleshed out by the customary apparatus of cell phones and computers. When the directions of the two undercover men intersect, will they ultimately arrive on either side of the same phone call? When the police suppose they have a rat amongst them, what if they appoint the rat to hunt himself? Brief subtleties are fleeting but constant in the film's very tight, very layered editing, for instance the consecutive Catholic imagery surrounding a certain plot revelation. One of the informants following another and the subsequent foot chase is an extremely well-crafted sequence, nearly on par with Henry Hill's frantic cocaine-fueled day racing the helicopter in GoodFellas. Both show Scorsese's virtuosity in employing a panicky, hurried camera, sound and music placement and lots of quick cuts.The music---clever thematic connotations in the use of Lucia di Lammermoor among its rampant highlights---is so constant it overlaps. Only as the end nears is there any extensive pin-drop silence, which is that much more intense on account of our conditioning to the music. One of the film's rare silences is that long-anticipated interaction by phone, one of the final scenes before one of the arguable climaxes. It is so intense not only because of who's speaking with one another, but because at this point, The Departed has never been this quiet.It is fitting to gather that Boston blue-collar Irish-American men such as the predominant cast of characters were raised Irish Catholics, and that if they have drifted away from the church's laws, they have regardless not liberated themselves of an air of guilt. Now imagine the guilt when you are concurrently committing crimes and betraying the men who rely on you. Indeed, the motivators in The Departed are the oldest in the book, the notion of one's deepest selfhood, and how it affects each character's deeds, feelings and certainty.The roots of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's performances is that the familiar structure of movies implies that we trust most characters are behaving or communicating for themselves. Yet in nearly every scene in this movie, save for certain pivotal parts, they are not. Both actors channel this racking internal torment so that we can suppose and suspect it, though not see it. They're not sounding alarms to remind us of their betrayals. In that regard, the most truthful and candid characters in the movie are the good and evil men being deceived.There is another character who is entrenched in an ethical clamp, and may suspect it although she cannot for a long time realize it. That is Vera Farmiga's psychologist who works for the police, and who circumstantially comes to know both imposters. She is at first caught off guard by the 'good guy''s brutal eyewitness street honesty in a scene intercut with his unnerving experiences leading up to his seeing her. She is afraid of getting her feet wet outside her ivory tower status quo, but gradually her allegiance is not to her administrator but to her patient, and what a snarled thicket that turns into.Really, the entire cast serves a plentiful tonic of equally ornate and nuanced performances, from the leads to Ray Winstone's deeply felt right-hand man, Mark Wahlberg's becoming rendition of an abusive staff sergeant and Alec Baldwin's cheeky, restless veteran, and to fleeting bit roles. And in an utterly self-assured, spontaneous and Oscar-worthy performance, Jack Nicholson makes Frank Costello not just a godfather, turncoat or show-off, but a crafty and infectiously charismatic man whose betrayal runs so deep with his protégé it's horribly sad. And it's representative of his real-life inspiration Whitey Bulger's betrayal of his loyal and desperately dependent Southie community.",10,3,10,7 October 2006
Psycho," The Persona of Horror Films
","It wasn't a message about psychological abuse or the dark side of the maternal instinct that enthused the audiences, nor was it any particular performance. They were stimulated by sheer, out-and-out cinema. Hitchcock consciously shot Psycho not with his high-priced feature regulars but with his TV crew. Lengthy segments hold no dialogue. In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.But no other Hitchcock film had more effect. He's directing us. It was the most staggering film 1960 moviegoers had ever experienced. You couldn't be today's pervasive moviegoer: Walking in late, you'd be waiting to see the star after she's disappeared from the action. Plus, the internet would've shattered any possibility of preserving the movie's genuine shocks, none of which one could've anticipated Hitchcock had in store without it. Modern moviegoers would've ruined this film for themselves before even walking in. He didn't just direct movies. He directed us. He directed several subsequent decades of movie plot expectations.Of course, today's generation can still see it as a fearsome, ingenious thriller despite knowing all about the shower scene that would've been like the revelation of Luke Skywalker's father in 1960 terms rather than 1980 ones. It's all owing to Hitchcock's imagination in two matters not as obvious: The pure subjective telling of Marion Crane's story, and her rapport with her new host. Hitchcock's trick is dedicating his thorough concentration and flair to handling them like they'll be expanded upon for the whole remaining film.Anthony Perkins is uncanny in establishing the thorny character of Norman, in a performance that has become momentous. He lets us know there's something deeply amiss with Norman, and yet he has a young man's congeniality, stuffing his hands into his pockets, hopping onto the porch, beaming a toothy greeting. Only when discussion becomes personal does he begin to hesitate and sidestep. He evokes our empathy right alongside Marion's.Nearly every present-day viewer is spending that whole time anticipating the spectacle of murder in store. However, seeing the shower scene today, various elements are notable. Unlike contemporary horror films, Psycho never sees the knife actually striking flesh. We see no wounds. Herrmann's slicing strings deputize for more gruesome sounds. And yet this remains the most famously shocking of cinema's slasher deaths, suggesting that graphic details are more shocking in our mind's eye and ear depending on their circumstances and creativity.The terror of the rug being yanked swiftly and completely from beneath us is followed by Norman's painstaking erasure of the whole staggering affair. Hitchcock is subtly swapping protagonists. The new one killed the old one, yes, but we relate to Norman because, if we killed somebody, we'd be devoured by paranoia and remorse, just like him. The car sinks, then lingers. Norman watches fixedly, until it's ultimately submerged beneath the swamp.Checking one's feelings, it dawns that we want that car to sink, which is what Norman wants. This is one of the most daring exchanges in Hitchcock's sustained custom of stage-managing the audience itself. Psycho's legend and luster will never die because, when innumerable films are over and done as the credits roll, it ties as candidly with our apprehensions as movie-making form can: That any one of us may impetuously commit a crime, our dread and paranoia of the police, our nightmares of becoming the quarry of a madman, and naturally, of failing our mothers.",10,0,0,24 October 2011
Rosemary's Baby," A Complex Scare
","Understanding that the horror is internalized within the story itself and expressed through the mundaneness of the actors' expressions, I was not successfully horrified, yet I was successfully enthralled. I found the villainy and situations to be tense and even irksome, which is a word one doesn't often use when referring to a reaction to a film. The film's later revelations are not necessarily scary but alternately intense and almost humorous, almost like a Charlie Kaufman script.Whatever the intentions of the film, whether to be a horror film, an off-putting blend of genres and techniques, or a thriller, it has an effect above that of many of the scariest horror movies, not because it's a more consuming effect that being genuinely scared in the way that Psycho or Saw scare, but because it's an effect that is more complex, thus more complex to achieve. At first, I was put off by the scale of the film-making, which expresses its big budget, large cinematographic scope, and less of an insular or atmospheric environment one would imagine being necessary to be successfully creepy. Now I can see that it was all a part of Polanski's vision.",8,0,1,20 January 2008
When Harry Met Sally...," Among the Elect Posse of Exceptionally Valid Romantic Comedies
","When Harry Met Sally... is among the elect posse of exceptionally valid romantic comedies, because each scene ends, in whatever way, significantly different from our expectations. Many girls, and guys, like my dad, which is strange, are drawn im perpetuum to films that have been made since that ride roughshod over nuance in favor of embellishing every emotional cue to the degree that we won't be surprised if leafhoppers just began feeding off of them. But only seldom has a modern romantic comedy with all the button-down ingredients---Manhattan yuppie life, New Years' Eve drama, man-to-man hoo-ha in the batting cage, humor drawn from a woman's uptightness---really worked on a sincere and disciplined level like this film, which even has the shrewdness to make a Harry Connick, Jr. soundtrack appealing.Minus the machismo complex, a chick flick is slang for a film designed to appeal to a female target audience. Including the macho dismissal would mean reference to films that are heavy with emotion or contain relationship-centered themes. Including the macho dismissal, this movie is not a chick flick. As for minus: If it's good, it doesn't matter. With a combination of imagination and realism, Nora Ephron's big breakthrough script raises the question 'Can men and women ever just be friends?' and advances many notions about love that have become household concepts now, like the 'high-maintenance' girlfriend and the 'transitional person.'Ephron never seems to have a problem with crafting very tight-knit self-contained plays from scene to scene, aligning broad comedy and seasoned pondering so that they spring from the same catalysts. Rob Reiner keenly gift-wraps it for us, with the thematic progress and humor reassured, but it is never disingenuous. Yes, that's Meg Ryan. Yes, that's Billy Crystal. But they come off just as real as Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher effortlessly do. The beats and timing, even when exaggerated, are unflappably natural. Caryn James said it was like the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an awkward familiarity. In spite of my normal defensiveness of this film, not to mention any and every Woody Allen one, I think I can live with that assessment on the grounds it is succinct and indeed comparable.",10,0,1,26 August 2009
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's Disturbing Apocalyptic Saga Sports a Mastery of the Long Take
","Steven Spielberg's up-to-date rendition of H.G. Wells's relentless nightmare is a lot better than it is given credit for being. It follows a real family with real complications, none of which Hollywood screenwriters were to be expected to create when enlisted to construct a formula visual effects extravaganza, and because writers David Koepp and Josh Friedman took that expository time to make us care about the friction between self-centered New Jersey dock worker Tom Cruise, his 10-year-old daughter Dakota Fanning, who suffers from a panic disorder and his teenage son Justin Chatwin, who outright resents him, the cataclysmal disaster that comes down just like the wall clouds and electromagnetic pulses that unleash it is all the more harrowing.I was glued to Spielberg's Morgan Freeman-narrated blockbuster. The fears it stimulates create an unrelenting mood of hopeless, helpless fright which we share with the people in the movie. Spielberg's mastery of marrying spectacle with tension, working with nine-figure budgets and hundreds of thousands of people, none of which deter his strength of vision, generates a dark realization in us, rather than a simple escapist entertainment. He presents strange cloud formations associated with thunder strikes, an arresting amount lower than the rain-free base of the sky. It starts to let loose poundings in the in close proximity to Tom Cruise's everyday Newark neighborhood, immobilizing all of the functioning electronic mechanisms nearby, including cars, leaving everyone trapped. A huge Tripod android surfaces from underground and commences in vaporizing people and buildings in its ample path.There is truly a disturbing feeling of tragedy whenever there is a casualty of the least significant bystander. There is something very freaky about red weed, the ever-growing plant that, according to H.G. Wells's story, gives Mars its fuzzy blood red color. Ships sink. Cities are destroyed. Children are in peril. Blood is everywhere. Tentacles. A magnificent plane wreck. And a treacherous expedition from New York to Boston with these devastating obstacles exploding in the way.This sci-fi action chase picture certainly has its glaring clichés here and there, but it is very observed, as films should be, especially spectacle films. The standpoint of the story is very personal. Any given human being can feel connected with the point of view, because it's about a family struggling unremittingly to survive and survive together, and they're contained by the most ambitiously dire and staggering events one could envision.Not being particularly partial to monster-budgeted special effects blockbusters, I much prefer a director like Spielberg, whose knowledge of film language can be seen in extensive concept shots rather than in heaps of coverage. Spielberg's disturbing apocalyptic saga sports a mastery of the long take, not to mention the logistically impossible several-minute- long tracking and dollying. Many of the film's biggest effects shots are unbroken, where the audience studies its magnitude and absorbs its impact. Michael Bay, or even a fairly talented director like Tony or Ridley Scott, would create artifice with a dozen camera angles, where no shot lasts longer than a brief moment before the film cuts to another. Spielberg, no matter how layman the majority of his film's audiences are likely to be, refuses to talk down to his audience. What makes this $132 million disaster movie above average is that there is fluency, ominous pace and a sense of realistic style, all of which put us within the actual events.",8,4,8,4 November 2008
30 Days of Night," Don't Be Short-Changed By Personality Over Character
","There's a quote I recently read by the author W. Somerset Maugham. 'When you choose your friends, don't be short-changed by choosing personality over character.' 30 Days of Night seems to have been made by and will likely be enjoyed the most by people who have not read this quote or have come to a conclusion relative to Maugham's. However, can you blame them so much? This film appears to be a ground-breaker in its own right. It has some of the most striking and beautifully Gothic cinematography I have ever seen. It is so bleak in a way that is somehow inventive. I've never seen a film before this that has looked this way or similarly enough to it to be reminiscent. The photography is no doubt the film's most valuable quality.It's the film's look that gives it's small-town Alaska setting such atmosphere, such an all- consuming limitation that makes it feel so cut off from the rest of America. Would anyone here in Cincinnati find it plausible that vampires could take the town over? Surely somehow they could be overpowered. Not in this town, which is given a spotlit weakness by its wondrously atmospheric appearance in this film.Even if it's hard to believe that with a well-populated town, vampires intelligent enough to have Danny Huston as a leader would rampage and kill everybody rather than rounding them up and feed to their satisfaction, the relentlessness of the vampires and their unyielding ruthlessness accompanied by the filmmakers' willingness to stay with scenes of horrible torture, screaming, brutality, and depressingly sad scenes of gore, and how little the script cares to let minor characters go, and go in merciless ways only those who've survived some of the world's most horrific atrocities will feel they've seen any semblance of in witnessing death before, gives the film great intensity and suspense. But if it only could not go limp on us in the last 20 minutes, when the screenwriters, instead of climbing off for a smoke break, simply ran out of breath and let the pounding get weaker and drone on till the satisfied but rather flimsy finish.Those last twenty minutes or so haven't the meaning or effort as such dense tissue like the rest of the movie up till then, even though the entire time it's rather difficult to overlook how characters can hide from their relentless predators when every step should make a footprint in the snow, when it tapers off into implausibility in the context of its own creative license, not to mention silly American tough-guy-going-down-and-taking-as- many-of-them-with-me-as-I-can gimmickry. (For example, injecting oneself with vampire blood is a completely pointless act when it's fifteen minutes before sun-up.) Nonetheless, I still somehow did not leave this film reflecting upon it with such bad taste in my mouth. I don't look at it as a ground-breaker and certainly not a contemporary classic, but the inspired stylistic intensity in the film-making, responsibility for which can be taken by director David Slade, who also directed the seamless, criminally overlooked gem of a thriller Hard Candy, will hopefully be built upon with Slade's following efforts.",9,1,1,19 January 2008
There Will Be Blood," Greed Comes at the Price of One's Soul
","Daniel Day-Lewis has always been fascinating to me. He's an extraordinary actor who I believe I saw for the first time when I saw Gangs of New York, in which he was one of the most lovable villains I'd seen up till that time. But with each role I've seen him play, he has an entirely different presence. For instance, he seems like a totally different person in every way when he's shaven as opposed to mustachioed. Despite Day-Lewis's intriguing stiffness and Minotaur-like density, he is capable of inordinate transformation to the point of complete contradiction. In There Will Be Blood, his physical inhabitance of Daniel Plainview, accompanied by a brilliantly realized sandpaper voice, is a lurching cartoon villain of opaqueness, impossible to probe. Day-Lewis's portrayal is so deeply subjective that the innate content of Plainview asserts itself thoroughly over form.A rivalry is sparked between secularist rags-to-riches oil magnate Plainview and ambitious young priest Eli Sunday, played powerfully by Paul Dano, as Plainview, feeling secure in his dissociative feelings, sees himself reflected in Eli's anti-social greed. Plainview's son is the only person he trusts amidst all of his shrewd manipulations and pragmatism, but when his son goes deaf after an oil rig incident, they estrange and his trust becomes totally displaced and his soul is eclipsed, and the world dances around these inert, degenerate people until, well, they are 'finished.'Paul Thomas Anderson, all of whose films so far have become favorites of mine, has succeeded in setting a new bar in cinema, having bewilderingly gotten away clean with an incredible amount of risks with this shifty, cynical, mystifying masterpiece. Like Day-Lewis playing Daniel Plainview, he has plunged into a solitary subjectivity that has removed him from the influences of mainstream convention. It's an unremitting film, relentless to be completely itself. One of the less subtle examples would be Jonny Greenwood's atonal and dissonant music score.A key scene in this movie is the first sermon given by Eli Sunday. It is a perfectly directed and acted scene. Eli proceeds to make an extreme fool out of himself, with total confidence. What he says and does are all completely ridiculous, often contradicting himself or failing to make any sense, and no matter how far Dano goes, Anderson's tone remains undisturbedly cynical. Just as he did with the documentary interviews in Boogie Nights, we aren't put off by the self-indulgent idiocy of his characters; in fact we laugh a bit without losing touch with the film's current.There Will Be Blood is the fascinating sort of film out of which you stumble, distraughtly rummaging for an adjective or neighborhood of feeling that are both vivid and explanatory enough to cover all corners of your experience and individually characteristic enough to identify your mind, which is routinely on a different wavelength that this movie. It's an indictment of the sociopathic institutions of industry and organized religion. It's a character study. It's a clash of egos. It's an impression of a time. It's a detailed account of a time.This is a film movie buffs will analyze, debate, and rewatch endlessly. Now of course the snobs will retort with claims that each other does not understand the context and meaning and this and that, but the important thing to do with this film is wash away all that you hear from pretentious pseudointellectuals and let the film effect you on your own terms.It can hardly be argued that there was most certainly kismet involved in the overlapping productions of There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men, two films released recently very close together, having been shot in the same West Texas locations and at times getting in each other's way.",10,3,5,18 July 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," It's a Comedy in the Truest Sense: It's a Tragedy, Too.
","Whether it's better or not, the persistent battle in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and whom it's between serves as a secluded epitome of the culture hostilities of the 1970s more creatively, engagingly and powerfully than Joe, Midnight Cowboy or Five Easy Pieces before it, matched perhaps only in that regard by They Shoot Horses, Don't They? The big difference is that Cuckoo's Nest is hilarious, and a comedy in the truest sense: It's also a tragedy. There's a quietly unmitigated close-up of Nicholson a little more than halfway through. We become aware of it because it hangs on warily. It shows R.P. McMurphy pensive. It comes at the match point flanked by the mirth and mischief of the previous portion of the film, and the closing deterioration into misfortune. What is he feeling? Is he plotting more insubordination? Grasp that all is hopeless? The vagueness of what McMurphy is thinking is the film's driving ambiguity. It all leads up to a late scene where he's found asleep on the floor next to an open window. Has his soul finally expired? Subdued for the post-classical '70s into a fable about society's imposition of conformism, it almost knowingly disregards the truths of mental illness so as to turn the patients into a set of snuggly characters ready for McMurphy's egging on. We learn that one is not actually mute, one doesn't have to stammer, and others need not be debilitated by introversion or dread. They'll be healed not by Nurse Ratched's medication, Muzak and counseling sessions, but by McMurphy invigorating them to be guys, to watch the World Series, go fishing, play basketball, get smashed, get laid. The memo for these miserable patients is: Be like him.The movie's naive attitude toward psychosis is not actually a weakness of the movie, as it has no concern with being about that. It's about a freethinker in a lockstep system. Nurse Ratched, who is so uncompromising, so insipidly certain she's right, characterizes the American 'cult of motherhood' at its militant maximum, and McMurphy is the local color who wants to escape from her form of society. The movie is among other things deeply afraid of women. The only two depicted optimistically are McMurphy's hooker acquaintances Candy and Rose. I mean this as an comment, not a censure.McMurphy's backstory is inferred early on. He was sentenced to a prison farm for doing the deed with an underage girl, and has been sent to the mental institution for 'evaluation.' He's observably a rabble-rouser, and yet acutely egalitarian: He takes the patients head-on, treats their disorders as choices that can be reordered, and attempts by pure power of determination to break them free into a nibble of independence. The movie views them that way, too. The cinematography and editing provide reaction shots that nearly always have the same implication: A given patient's rigid expression is misconstrued thanks to the new perspective given by McMurphy. For instance, McMurphy has stolen the boat and has the group aboard. When he's interrogated, he introduces them all as doctors, and there are quick cuts to close-ups of each one looking vaguely formal like clockwork. This has nothing to do with mental illness but everything to do with slapstick.Nicholson's performance is one of the acmes in a lengthy career of enviable anarchists. Jack is a much-loved American presence. And if his performance is rightly praised, Louise Fletcher's, notwithstanding the Oscar, is not valued enough. This may be since her Nurse Ratched is so meticulously loathsome, and since she exemplifies so utterly the traits we all have been trained to fear in a particular variety of female authority, a woman who has fused sexuality and sympathy into responsibility and rectitude. Dressed in her distantly militaristic nurse's uniform, she is at once bondage mistress and dungeon master, followed everywhere by the petite, non-speaking nurse who is her altar assistant.Since we react so ardently to her we barely see Fletcher's performance. Her uncanny composure, her pokerfaced 'fairness,' her obstinate observance of policy, as in the scene where she orders McMurphy to get a majority vote in order to watch the World Series on TV, regardless that a majority of the patients don't comprehend what they're voting on. Later, when McMurphy's ultimate fortune is settled on, note how the male overseer hesitantly proposes he be returned to the prison farm, though Ratched resolutely gainsays him.This great human comedy stays everlastingly well-liked as a subversive fable, but realizes its triumph by thoughtfully electing to utilize the mental patients as droll exaggerations. This initiates the fishing excursion, which is simultaneously the most enjoyed, and the most deceptive, scene in the movie. It's McMurphy's noble-cheerful flip of the bird at Ratched and her breed, but the oomph of the sequence can't camouflage the anxiety and bewilderment of men who, in several instances, don't know where they are, or why. Bear in mind by contrast the understated, late-night monologue by the Chief, who talks about his father. This is a window into a genuine character with genuine and fascinating issues, and leads up to the bittersweet release of the very final scenes.",10,1,2,7 February 2011
Downfall," Riveting
","Downfall views an extremely convincing, totally intriguing portrayal of Adolph Hitler, whom we know so much about, yet we are intensely engrossed in Bruno Ganz's performance. We have always known what he's done, but it takes an extremely well-directed, very powerful film like Downfall, showcasing Ganz in a lifetime's performance, to realize immediately that he saw so clearly and stubbornly his focal point in life. In scenes where he loses his temper, we see a man who is of course headstrong and violent, but not at all haywire. He had ideas etched in stone and when people did not understand, they suffered his wrath.Also, rather than a safe, worried little American film that would never show him doing anything but screaming and massacring people, perhaps it takes the perspective of a German film, whose perspective not only counts greatly in a film about the Third Reich, quite obviously, but also, frankly, being a European film, is much more trustworthy in its appearance of honesty. The perspective of the main character, who is not Hitler but one of his naive secretaries, sees an authentically generous individual, who does have a questionable semblance of a heart, even when she sees him cruelly and disgustingly test poison on one of his loyal dogs. From a clever point of view of naivete, we actually see the raw Hitler unbiased, though we're aware of his inordinate viciousness, who is broad and extremely practical in his ways, yet his nature is so dominant that he frequently finds it rather difficult to work his loyal Nazis. As we hear him angrily snarl in his bunker, we hear an exceedingly determined monster who possesses unlimited faith in his own knowledge.",9,2,4,6 July 2007
The Wolf of Wall Street," Quaalude Overdoses and Midget-Throwing: A Martin Scorsese Picture
","Very likely being an avid follower of Martin Scorsese's works and even more likely to be particularly fanatical about his most accessible and recent films, you were right in expecting a total reflection of the GoodFellas/Casino formula and style---machine gun cutting, swooping camera, characters bursting through the fourth wall like wrecking balls, monster production scope and a soundtrack like a jukebox on speed, all to get us high on our complicity in the excessive debauchery of the characters and their fast-paced lifestyle---and it is indeed awesome. But it is also amazingly effective as a slapstick comedy, loaded with outrageous and absurd laugh-out-loud set pieces.I say amazing because Scorsese has never done scenes like that and DiCaprio has never even done a comedy before. Scorsese has, but the hilarity here is not in the same vein as The King of Comedy. Or After Hours. It's much broader, goofier and unexpected, as demonstrated in several epic comic tours de force throughout. And it's that very sense of absurdity that makes its commentary on American capitalistic gluttony whole. You know exactly what movie you'll be seeing, but you'll be cheating yourself out of one hell of a ride if you don't see it. It clocks in at three hours but you still won't really want it to end. The movie is as outsized, excessive and compulsive as its title character is.Money here is not just the root of all evil. It's the total disintegration of any and all traces of decency, at the throbbing heart of which is DiCaprio's character, Jordan Belfort, a real-life stock trader so outrageously shameless and blind to his routine corruption that he virtually appears to be sympathetic, even chivalrous. Belfort couldn't care less whether his clients made money, so long as his share was complete. And like the oligarchs running the country now, his forte was defrauding the the struggling working man who he jockeyed into investing in third-rate penny stocks. Even his sweet first wife is feeling enough to wonder why he marks people who can't afford to be conned. Her civility gets in his way and she's promptly usurped by a blonde lingerie model.Scorsese's always able to take hard-to-like characters and look at them without judgment, then somehow never have a single dull moment no matter how long he has us watch them. In this case, unabashed farce is the key to it working as a commentary on the absurd overload of greed in this country and how disconnected the super-rich are from their actions and how they affect other people. It also has the most enjoyable and random cast I've seen in a long time, and almost certainly Jonah Hill's finest hour (or three).Sure, Jordan Belfort begins as a mild-mannered kid with a dream, refusing lunchtime martinis and all, but most of us start out with a soul and a sense of self-control, until we reach a level so rarefied and powerful that you never see any consequences or hardships, and you're cushioned and gratified so completely in a world of leisure and lavishness that whether or not you put the country in debt or screw a few working-class people doesn't really feel like it makes much difference.As long as the class divides are that wide, that will always be the case. We are constantly baffled by the total lack of conscience in the actions of the 1% and the politicians they puppeteer, but at the same time they honestly must feel that underprivileged people are that way because they choose to be, or simply aren't as smart as them. It's a catch-22 and the only thing we can do, Scorsese says, is laugh at it.",10,3,11,29 December 2013
Scream 2," Blame the Media!
","Scream was a cutting-edge film, the first horror movie in which the characters had seen other horror movies, knew all the conventions, and didn't make the barefaced boo-boos without letting us know that's what they were. In Scream 2, the characters have seen a movie about the first killings, and are caught once again in a slasher fantasy. Like all sequels, this one is a see-through endeavor to cash in on the original, but, naturally, it knows it is, and features its own educated discourse on sequels. The finding is that a mere handful of sequels have been as good as the originals; the characters particularly like Aliens and The Godfather Part II. As for Scream 2, it's, well, about as good as the original. Both movies use a narrative contraption for making the audience flinch and gasp and grasp their pillows. The shocks this time come from a mad slasher in an oddly unsettling Halloween ghost mask, who ambushes a slew of college freshmen who lived through the initial murders. The killer is also concerned with such hangers-on as a TV newsman and a physically and emotionally wounded former deputy sheriff.Kevin Williamson's basis this time is that violence is swiftly rendered into commercial ritual by the media: Because he is doing that very thing in Scream 2, there are paradoxes within paradoxes here. The movie is so expressive about what it's doing, in fact, that you can't knock it on that basis because it gets there first. Do movies prompt people to commit violent acts? Scream 2 seemed to think so, or is that a mocking position, to make the movie more effective? Have movies like this, by enlightening its audience to the traditions and ridiculous banalities of horror films, pacified their violence and make them less apt to be persuaded by the violence? Now there's an interesting thought.The movie's brilliant beginning sequence involves a theatrical premiere of Stab, a movie based on the killings in the first film, and at the screening two audience members are, well, see for yourself. Soon the slasher has moved to a neighboring campus, where survivors including Sidney Prescott are students, and the wounded Deputy Riley has found a job as a security guard. Also loitering is TV newswoman Gale Weathers, who---this is priceless satire---covered the first murders and wrote a best-seller about them that became 'Stab' and has thus influenced the new murders. Also brooding around is Cotton, accused by Gale in the first film but found innocent, and now urging a second helping of his 15 minutes of fame. There is no way to predict the identity of the killer, and everyone who acts leery is (almost) certain to be innocent.The Williamson screenplay employs the horror scaffold as a rocket platform for considerable parody. I'd like to have seen him work on a more serious film. When Courteney Cox, playing the TV newswoman, is asked about her nude photos on the Internet, she replies, 'It was just my head. It was Jennifer Aniston's body.' And a killer says he wants to be caught, because he's already determined his plan of action: 'The movies made me do it,' he'll proclaim, and he plans to have Bob Dole as a witness for the defense. 'I'll get Cochran!' he boasts. 'The Christian Coalition will pay for my defense!' Wes Craven was made to direct the Scream films. One of the most productive of horror filmmakers, he made The Hills Have Eyes and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and was already headed in the same metatextual trajectory as Williamson when he wrote and directed Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, which took his own series' blurring of reality and nightmares to a new extreme, Freddy crossing over to attack the filmmakers in the 'real' world. There's a difference here in the Scream movies where an all-new slasher killer causes the post-modern irony to be more disguised, and what might be the most ironic thing about these ever more ironic movies is that it resuscitated the entire genre. Spawning countless imitations, the joke is on them!",8,0,1,20 May 2010
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Makes Tim Burton Look Like Aki Kaurismaki
","Francis Ford Coppola's madly elaborate Dracula rendition is set between London at the advent of a modern-ish age and Transylvania according to an explosion at the Batman: The Animated Series factory. We meet a young attorney named Jonathan Harker who is supposed to venture to Dracula's castle to arrange some kind of real estate whatever stuff. The last guy who went there ran into some snags. No big deal, though. He goes, and there begins a series of deafening and flagrant omens, none of which seem to deter or even catch the attention of young Harker en route.It seems as though every stop is being pulled out on Jonathan Harker's journey to let him know that danger is near. Many find the casting of Keanu Reeves in the role laughably wrong-headed, but if you think about it, he's the only one with a blank and vapid enough stare to be believable as someone who manages to miss the most aggressively blatant signs of suspicion.Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Professor Van Helsing as a guy who may not be able to save victims of wolf rape, but sure can explain the hell out of it. Now, there is a lot that transpires between the voyage to Salvador Dali's Looney Tunes night terror and the werewolf violation, but Coppola and his creative team show every brazen sign of being far more interested in parades of extravagance and ceremonious tableau than with narrative power. The movie is extraordinarily theatrical in how it favors intensification over flow.The lavish use of expressionism reaches to such heights that it ends up eliciting unwanted laughter. Every set, every backdrop, every detail, foreshadowing, subtext, atmospheric flourish and mere shadow on the wall is screamed at us. It makes Tim Burton look like a Scandinavian minimalist. But all the same, it can be fun letting yourself get swept up in the energy and exhilaration of the whole go-for-broke enterprise.It does, after all, salvage the title character from the creative flatness of most of his other movie interpretations, and then some. I'd argue that Werner Herzog's Nosferatu takes the cake as the more deeply affecting choice, but I mean, it didn't have wolf rape or baby-eating nymphomaniacs or Tom Waits as an insane guy. Or wolf rape. And Gary Oldman is here. And Sir Anthony Hopkins. They've never detracted from the quality of any movies either have been in as far as I can tell. But more to the point, as the movie sees it, there is a reason why the three Oscars it happened to win were for makeup, costume design and sound editing. It was also nominated for one more, and that was art direction. By now, you surely see the common thread: As a sensory experience, it's a gasser.",7,2,5,25 January 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," 'Are You Aiming For These People?!'
","A fitting ta-ta to what should've remained the trilogy of lovingly crafted action thrillers, Die Hard with a Vengeance is about as good as it gets among the 1990s Hollywood action cycle. True to the Die Hard formula, Bruce Willis' crass old-school New York cop John McClane takes on a situation way over his head in roughly under a day's time. The charm of With a Vengeance is that it takes place in McClane's city, where McClane is in his element, but not. We see the crass old-school NYPD itself, resolving issues and doing detective work with profane exclamations, matter-of-course Styrofoam coffee cups and worn-out suits they've probably been sleeping in. It follows the old custom that hero cops are either suspended or should be, but that is not the opposition to McClane's as-the-crow-flies brand of individual police work. It is something much more complex, and personal.I'm aware that Jonathan Hensleigh's script in the form of Die Hard 3 has been reworked from a potential Lethal Weapon 4, from there having been reworked from an original script called Simon Says. Regardless of whatever inevitable contrivance that was necessary to assert franchise characters into his original plot, the result is one of the very best-written Hollywood action-adventures of the '90s. Yes, there are some holes. One might go as far as to say the plot under real scrutiny is Swiss cheese: Our classy villain Simon could not have employed his necessary camouflage justification for his complex plan as long as required without arousing doubt among the police, which he would've had McClane been snuffed during his first chore in Harlem, which could've happened without any difficulty. That is the one major thing at variance with Simon's otherwise fail-safe plan, but then no one who is aware or becomes aware of the Federal Reserve incident either recalls, or finds it gracious or worthwhile enough to bring up that billions in stolen gold is laying in the Aqueduct following an explosion.Nevertheless, in spite of it all, Hensleigh's screenplay transcends any boilerplate situations or characterizations with unique, and thus less predictable and more exciting, turns on their heads. The most prominent of these is Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's unwitting and unwilling shopkeeper partner Zeus, an ingenious departure from the buddy-cop blueprint. Upon his encounter with McClane in Harlem, he has no reason to like him, or believe what he finds he's gotten himself into, and yet he has little choice whenSimon says. Zeus has a racial chip on his shoulder, and for him to confront the reluctant and terrified McClane in the sadistic scenario Simon has forced him into, is to make a gesture of pure social conscience and shows various levels of humanity, automatically making him an exceptionally sympathetic character. And when he and McClane begin to bond, in their own cynical, acidic New Yorker ways, over the course of this phenomenally chaotic day of explosions, gunfights, helicopter catastrophes and unrelenting German soldiers, we feel we have seen real characters go from profoundly resenting to profoundly respecting one another.The movie follows in the Reaganite blockbuster tradition of streamlined stunts and nonstop million-dollar set pieces of mass destruction, and they do rock, but scenes of dialogue and deduction are not mere bridges between those extravagant tableaux. Two irrevocably hostile and deeply imperfect people thrown together in a city of 8 million people like McClane and Zeus, an Irish Brooklynite cop and a black Harlem electronics store owner, bound not to get along much, are given thirty seconds to crack ancient nursery rhyme riddles and yet they just can't stop fighting and cursing each other. Mathematical problems and other brain busters segue back and forth between the problem at hand and the personal problems they have with each other. But they end up using their heads in ways the other didn't expect. They end up inextricably necessary to each other to foil Simon's plot, which all holes considered turns out to be rather brilliant.Yes, Die Hard with a Vengeance is a real pleasure of its kind. McTiernan's back in the director's chair, and Jeremy Irons returns the series in the direction of classy, well-mannered villains, bad guys whose intentions are highly intelligent and mostly plausible, and who are scary because they are so nice to you when they talk. Even though they are threatening various lives and have comparatively mean thugs pointing guns at you, you still want to have a cup of coffee with them. It's difficult to say Rickman as Gruber in Die Hard 1 was anything but peerless, but Irons is a formidable comparison, I must admit. Iron's Simon is not a recycling of Rickman's Gruber. His mannered behavior is also not quite as infectious. But Irons, a powerful actor all his own, is his own fascinating, multi-dimensional beast, a soldier whose purpose and scheme are engraved like clockwork in his mind, from Plan A to Plan B all the way down the line. But what is his purpose? We think we know until there's yet another revelation, but what of the first revelation? It's true to some extent, but where do his ideals truly lie?",9,1,2,23 May 2010
American Gangster," Even In the Drug Trade, Ethics, Stereotypes and Practices Can Run You Out of Business
","American Gangster is an enormous entertainment, one of the contemporary gangster epics, and a terrific one-year-later follow-up to the 2006 mob opus The Departed. However, it's tough to give this movie the ceiling rating I badly want to give it, the 10 I tend to give the American gangster film, which generally gives me some of the most thrilling satisfaction I ever get from film, because Ridley Scott's adaptation of Frank Lucas's life is softened around the edges by purely Hollywood production values. The film is not shot with a particularly expansive creative eye but rather with the coverage-themed American studio approach and an intermittent amount of very standard character looks. Nevertheless, American Gangster is still cracklingly pleasurable.It is blessed with a wonderful soundtrack, as has come to be a compulsion in the gangster genre. The film is rich with that heaving funk energy of its late '60s, '70s era. Sam & Dave, The Staple Singers, and Bobby Womack blare exciting classics that pump the movie's spirit, and Anthony Hamilton, in a lusciously visceral nightclub scene, sings a wonderful song masterfully fashioned to adapt to the film's period.Also, Denzel Washington, whose presence drives nearly the entire movie, finds an infinite amount of comfort in a role that just may be a niche for him. Firstly, he's very becoming. It's not long before we're lost in the world of cold, ingeniously pragmatic, Frank Lucas, a multi- faceted man beyond the limitations of such an impersonal demeanor. Secondly, Washington is pleasing to watch. It's just a joy, as it tends to be with villains, to be in his subjectively honorable and increasingly unaligned company.Russell Crowe, in more of a supporting role than opposite, does not stand out as he did, again so pleasingly, as the villain in 3:10 To Yuma, however beyond the standardization of his hero character, a disheveled, unorthodox, womanizing cop, there is a very amiable person that he fleshes out. There is one particular scene that I love for its implicit theme: While the rest of Detective Richie Roberts's (Crowe) clan of undercover street cops are watching a boxing match, Roberts, despite sitting amongst them, has his mind somewhere else and to me somehow seems more refreshingly individual than the rest of them. What makes Roberts the irregular hero that at least nearly matches the presence of the villain is his offbeat style of everything. No matter how many corny Hollywood good guy scenes he's given early in the film, the character shines through.Really, most of American Gangster's minor faults, such as Carla Gugino's character, the wife of Crowe who criticizes him passionately for being too wrapped up in his work, are protected by the fact that it's a true story.The movie may ride roughshod over many spots Ridley would've benefited from more carefully constructing, but inscrutable are its starpower, gritty twilight scenes of New York and New Jersey, vast scope, and tremendous climax, a razor-sharp heartpounder of violence, quick cuts, and drama which makes you feel like leaping out of your seat to applaud. Predominantly, there is an undeniably savory taste left in one's mouth, especially after the powerful final shot.",9,0,2,13 February 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," We Never Know When Life Will End, Or How
","Stranger Than Fiction is a film written by Zach Helm, a screenwriter who never let there be a dull moment in his dialogue or his story, and that includes the internal mechanics of both. Each character is a much different character than you expected them to be, and very absorbing and compelling that way, creating the film's universe, and because your attention is drawn to a character you've never seen before, you feel much more inclined to get to know them.I've always found Will Ferrell to be more of a talented actor than just a comedian, or an SNL alum who had a character big enough for the movies, hence happening upon a so-so film career. His characters in his comedies are too brilliantly stupid and wholly created. His timing is impeccable, as you will see in his almost robotically dull character in Stranger Than Fiction, Harold Crick, whose sudden losses of control are hilarious simply because of the contrast to what you've seen of him so far. He's an all-too-real satire of a commonly overlooked sort.Having recently seen In the Name of the Father, I commented on Emma Thompson's stunning talent as an actress, because I'd re-watched Primary Colors not too long before, and I realized how sparingly one thinks of her as anyone aside from her character. She completely becomes whomever she plays, like a chameleon. I see her now in Stranger Than Fiction and I realize the same thing about In the Name of the Father. Each film I see her in, the more I like her. She has a scene in this film that stands out, an interview her character gives on a network talk show, her host being a young bimbo whose lack of knowledge she finds so aggravating that she can't help from showing it in the expression of the answers she gives her, and she is hilarious.Dustin Hoffman does the opposite. As in Confidence, he's playing sort of a caricature of himself or a variation on his own personality rather than becoming a different one like in Rain Man or most of his earliest work. This doesn't detract from his performance however, though I've always enjoyed him as one of the few classic contemporary actors with the charisma that influences so many actors of later generations who actually does play many different people and explore many different genres and characters, as opposed to other great actors in that category---Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson, Penn---who take generally relative roles and infuse their own personas into them.The visual style of this film is very smart, conveying Harold Crick's mental state, as a mentally refined, all-too-reserved fellow who sees the world in numbers, systems and mechanisms everywhere he goes and fails to see life in other ways. The director, Marc Forster, shows us this as Crick goes through his daily algorithms and we see elegant diagrams and word groups with pointing lines, math problems done corresponding to his pondering through them. These image accompaniments don't necessarily face the audience, though they sometimes appear to be. Rather, they are facing Crick himself.It may seem odd that I analyze this film so much and study it so meticulously. When you see it, you'll realize that it truly is not just another blueprint zany comedy. It is one of the most intelligent and most well-made Hollywood films this year.",9,0,1,25 November 2006
The Reader," What Would Any One of Us Have Done If We Were Germans During Hitler's Rise?
","In this romantic drama, a young German, who has information that might prove the partial innocence of a woman about to be sentenced to life in prison, keeps it hidden. He hasn't the courage to reveal his affair with this woman to anyone outside of the two of them. By making this decision, he shifts the film's focus from the subject of German guilt about the Holocaust and turns it on the human race in general. The story means his choice as the key to its significance, but most of us American viewers will resolve that the movie is about the war crimes of the Nazis and their reaction by post-war German generations. Though I have always been interested in the coping post-WWII societies who committed the most pivotal atrocities of the war, namely Germany and Japan, that's not what the film meant to me. I found Kate Winslet's performance, and frankly her nude beauty, entranced me, and I was entrenched in a sort of existential concern for the well-laid plot in terms of how it affected her.This wise historical psychological drama's basic premise is a sexual relationship between Winslet, a mysterious and emotionally withholding woman in her mid-30s, and a 15-year- old boy played by David Kross. Whether or not such things are wrong, which really they aren't, or socially illicit, which they generally are, is not concerned here. The only thing that matters to the kid being intensely absorbed in the discovery of his sexuality. We are unsure of what matters to her, and perhaps she is, too, but the reality is there. She is aloof yet demanding with sex, it being obvious to her that a 15-year-old virgin would have absolutely no problem with that, but it seems to care more that he read to her. The film's three-time Oscar-nominated, BAFTA- and Tony-winning director Stephen Daldry depicts them almost entirely through nudity because when they are together, they are about nothing else.It happens, and the story, to me, is about the surprise life holds for a transitory relationship of both intense passion and total anonymity, how it links her earlier life and his later one. It is told in a flashback format and powerfully acted by Winslet and Kross, with Ralph Fiennes coldly enigmatic as the elder version of the character. The film is marketed as being as if Fiennes is the male lead, but Winslet and Kross are the core essence of the movie. This digital feature, only Daldry's third film and yet his third critical success, begins with Fiennes parting awkwardly with a one-night stand before watching an S-Bahn pass by outside, which leads us to flash back to another tram in 1958 Neustadt. An unhappy-looking teenaged Kross gets off but wanders around the streets. The following is shot almost entirely in shadows and silhouettes: He finally pauses in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he starts to vomit. The tram conductor, a woman, yes, her, comes by and coldly, pragmatically helps him.Winslet's character, who puts up a dominant, almost masculine, front, is indirectly deconstructed by not only a shocked Kross but characters who truly haven't met her before the surprising revelation about her. They get nowhere. One can't forgive what we learn she's done, but is that all there is to her? There is pressure in all societies to do what everyone else is doing, pressure much bigger than any single society. What would we have done if we were Germans during Hitler's rise? If we had been Jewish, we would've tried to flee, and we'd either be lucky or not so much. But if we weren't? Bernhard Schlink's story is a realization that many people are like these two characters, and nearly all of us have secrets that we would do unforgivable things to keep.",9,1,2,26 January 2009
Jaws," Fear of the Real, Grounded in Reality
","One of the first 'high concept' films and father of the American summer blockbuster tradition, happens over no other than July 4 weekend on Amity Island, a vacation resort fuelled by the dollars of its tourism. A famed opening sequence sets up the incidence of a man-eating shark in the coastal waters. A girl goes swimming by moonlight and is pulled under, shrieking. All indications identify a shark, but Mayor Vaughn doesn't want to scare away tourists, and instructs Brody, the police chief, to keep the beaches open. The mayor marches along the beach wearing a sport coat and tie, persuading people to go into the water. They do, with inevitable consequences.A town meeting is disrupted by the second of the film's central characters, the coarse, peering Quint. He grates his fingernails down a blackboard with a sketch of a shark and proposes his help as a bounty hunter. Later on, Brody sits at home thumbing through books on sharks, an expedient that establishes the predator in our heads as we observe page after page of alarming teeth, unfeeling black eyes and fatalities with hunks ripped from their flesh.The third crucial character is Hooper, an oceanographer, recruited as an consultant, and practical for the movie as he can assert tense information. Brody is certain the beaches must be closed and the shark slaughtered. The mayor plays for time, and then after the shark makes the news, a big reward is proposed, and Amity is teeming with careless fortune seekers. It's here that Spielberg works in one of his most ingenious and chilling visuals for signifying the shark, a pier breaking loose from its quay and floating out to sea. Then turning around and coming back toward shore. Drifting items are employed throughout the movie to evoke the unseen shark. In the central action sequences in the last part, we're frequently looking at kegs and not at a shark, but the idea is so well recognized that the shark is there.In keeping the Great White off-screen, the man who not long from his work here could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List was exercising an approach applied by Hitchcock throughout his career, the crucial, often mistaken difference between suspense and surprise. Spielberg uses the shark to suspenseful effect for most of the movie. And the screenplay doesn't loop itself into allegory. The characters all have clear-cut intentions. A little dialogue goes far. Single lines overhang for hard-bitten brevity. The finest scene in the movie is the night scene in the kitchenette, where the men chug brandy and Quint and Hooper equate wounds. Ultimately Quint embarks on a morose monologue, telling the WWII tale of the sinking of the Indianapolis. He was one of its crew. Of the thousand or so, he says, one of the three hundred something still left before rescue came.Most people seem too caught up to wonder why the shark seems willing to trouble itself so much, at one point even trying to eat the boat. The shark has been so completely determined, through dialogue and somewhat documentary background, that its actual presence is augmented in our minds by all we've absorbed. Also, Spielberg's first smash-hit features rudiments he duplicated in many of his movies. A night sea hunt for the shark presents an early instance of his pet visual trademark, a ray of light made perceptible by smog. He's continued to apply strong concentration on characters, rather than rushing past them to the special effects, as so many '80s and '90s effects directors did. In this watershed tour de force and later, he favors atmosphere over emotional battering, and one of the extraordinary things about the movie is its naturalistically low-key milieu. The recognizable theme by John Williams, which, I dunno, maybe you've heard, is subdued and cunning. It's frequently heard during point-of-view shots, at water level and below, that are another way Spielberg implies the shark without brandishing it. The cinematography, by Bill Butler, is painstakingly marshals the story amidst middle-class America. If Spielberg's preferred location would become the all-American residential communities, Jaws shows his favorite middle-class squatters on vacation.",10,3,6,17 February 2011
The Wrestler," A Walloping Emotional Powerhouse
","The Wrestler, a walloping emotional masterstroke, is about a man who can do one thing well, and doggedly continues to do it because of desperation, drowsy ability, and pride that always needs a lot of healing. He's a professional wrestler. From someone who feels like stabbing himself in the head whenever he sees pro-wrestling on TV, this remains one of the very best films of 2008. In a wrestling match, it's scripted that the villain blindsides the hero, who acts as if he doesn't see him, and body-slams him, but when the hero hits the floor, how does one fake that?Mickey Rourke plays the haggard, impoverished, abandoned hero, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. This is the performance of his life. And I mean that in every way in which that sentence can be interpreted. This is Rourke doing breathtaking physical acting. He has the corporeality of a body builder, maybe owing to some steroids, which would also be appropriate of Randy. He gets into the ring and does the extremely bloody work. His ring performances and the abuse he endures cement the backbone for the story, which involves his estrangement from his daughter, played with chameleon-like persuasiveness by Evan Rachel Wood, and what he hopes will become a relationship with the stripper Cassidy, played by the great beacon of Italian-American godesshood Marisa Tomei, who never ages. Never ages! Except for his backstage brotherhood with other wrestling veterans, whose peripheral performances brilliantly discern between the big-hearted companionship backstage from the brutality on it, Randy has incinerates all his bonds.Cassidy is as much a performer as Randy. They put on a show and give the customers what they want. It pays the rent. There is always a void between entertainers and their audiences. That's why so many of them marry each other. But Randy has become wiser in certain marginal respects with the years, less bedazzled by celebrity, more capable of accepting emotional longing. Randy has a residual friendliness and sweetness, which both helps and hurts him.Beyond the overwhelmingly putrefied atmosphere, the most absorbing aspect in Darren Aronofsky's powerhouse drama is the backstage nuance of low-rung pro-wrestling. In the dreary snow and slop of New Jersey, Randy and his challengers make the rounds of dingy union halls, school gyms, community centers, using whatever they can find for makeshift dressing rooms, duct-taping their wounds, priming their pumps and agreeing minutes before a match on its script. We grasp how they make themselves bleed, concoct brutal 'surprises,' parley over each fight. And then the audience sees them. Their preparation merely sees that they get battered in the ways for which they prepare, and not in unanticipated ways.I cared as deeply about Randy the Ram as any movie character I've seen this year. Machismo is something treated as inscrutable and distinctly characterized, and its residue cuts into all of us men, however macho we happen or choose to be. Aronofsky's manner of filming Rourke hand-held from behind powerfully signifies this. I have unqualified appreciation for an ubermasculine man with the physique and dominating sneer of Mickey Rourke who so unabashedly renders a tremendously muscular man in a profession that takes culturally induced machismo to the very extreme, and yet a man who can look behind his projected sense of self into a sentimental heart with needs, regrets and inferiorities. By the end, I was so mesmerized that I was surprised by the hard cut to black.",10,1,2,2 February 2009
Inception," In Media Res
","Writing Inception must've entailed extraordinary deliberation, like working a Rubic's Cube while playing the guitar. In one of its most charming, and briefest, scenes, the film's protagonist auditions a young architect by putting it to her to draw a maze. Nolan does this to us with his own dazzling maze. We have to rely on him that he can lead us through. Nolan must've rewritten this narrative over and over, finding that every alteration wrinkled the entire cloth. And it's impervious to spoilers: If you knew how it ended, that'd tell you nothing if you didn't know how it got there. And telling you how it got there would completely confuse you. The movie's all about procedure, struggling one's way through all-encompassing panes of reality and dream, reality inside dreams, dreams lacking reality. Like the protagonist of Nolan's Memento, the viewer of this awe-inspiring machine floats in phase and event, clarifying that you can never recall the start of a dream, and that dreams that feel as if to traverse hours may merely last a short time. And what if you're within another person's dream? How does your dream-time coordinate with theirs? What do you truly know? Cobb's a corporate raider of premier class. He penetrates the psyches of others to steal their thoughts, now hired by an influential tycoon for the opposite: Establishing an idea into a competitor's psyche, so efficiently he thinks it's his own. It's never been done before; our minds are as aware of external concepts as our immune system to toxins. Played by the compelling Ken Watanabe, the magnate makes him an irrebuttable proposal, one that'd resolve Cobb's banishment from home.Cobb Amasses A Crew, Nolan depending on the well-established dealings of all caper films. We meet the people he'll need: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his Man Friday; Tom Hardy, a virtuoso fraudster; Dileep Rao, a skillful biologist. And there's a greenhorn, Ariadne, the exceptional young architect, a genius spatial thinker. Cobb also goes to speak to his father-in-law Miles, who knows what he does and how. These days Michael Caine need simply show up and we presupposed he's more shrewd than any of the other characters. Talent. Cobb trains Ariadne in dream penetration, the skill of calculating dreams, traveling through them. Nolan is schooling us, too, while using the juncture for some of the movie's astounding effects. The most extraordinary plainly rolls a city back on itself like a textile spool.Defending Watanabe's rival, the emotionally agile Cillian Murphy, are any amount of armed mercenaries, who may be working like the cerebral parallel of vaccine. They seem variously authentic and abstract, but whichever, they lead to myriad struggles, chases, explosions---all necessary and earned---like every other element of this drum-tight plot. Structures tip. Streets curl. Characters glide. What the movie's about resolves how Nolan casts it, how it looks, the score, mixing, titles, and how it's been released: As soon as you're involving dreams, the mind's capabilities are boundless. And so the magnitude of the film has to feel boundless, like you could go anywhere by the end. And yet, the one fantastical concept that the film submits, honestly, is the existence of a technology that lets you go into and cohabitate the same dream as someone else.How can you truly protect yourself from being mistaken? We so often trust our feelings more than reason and good sense. The adventures reaches the real depth to which one can go within one's own subjectivity where one can no longer reliably or consistently discern between hallucination, memory, fantasy, dream, reality. When people say this is a movie about concepts, they really do literally mean concepts themselves: How ideas can revolutionize our deepest selves. How ideas, just someone muttering something to you a certain way at a certain time, can have a devious rudimentary impact like nothing else. Nolan slips in stimuli about the unrefined, immeasurable subconscious and how you simply cannot simulate genuine revelation, then fathoms the expanse of subconscious perpetuity and faking a genuine revelation.The acting's fine all around because the film's so heavily plot-driven that the characters can only be rooted in the personalities the cast brings to the screen. And so they hear with their own ears, see with their own eyes. That said, I don't know what it means that Ellen Page's Ariadne was by far my favorite character. I think it's because she feels so much more like a real person than these black-suited, slick-haired gun-wielding super-thieves. Though like most caper films, even this telepresent one's intentionally shallow in emotional terms. Nolan aids us with an emotional strand. The reason Cobb's goaded to gamble with the perils of inception is owing to heartache and self-reproach involving his family. Marion Cotillard personifies the wife in a romanticized fashion with hues of unpredictable madness. Whether we're seeing Cobb's recollections or his dreams is complex to say, even, literally, by the last shot. Yet she works as an emotional inducement, and the love between the two affords an emotional continuum in Cobb's world, which is otherwise incessantly metamorphosing. We're always in the present. Concerns of life, death and the heart are drawn in alongside multi-national corporations. And Nolan doesn't stop before employing his signature brilliantly fashioned scenes from the cream-of-the-crop stuff of capers or intelligence thrillers, among which it is.",9,5,15,14 October 2010
Sherlock Holmes," If Action is All You Give Them, Sooner or Later Action Will Be All They Want.
","Yet another quintessential character has been dispensed through the blockbuster factory, resulting as a cutting-edge bionic man. As he is always inclined to do, Guy Ritchie saturates his biggest movie to date with stylish visuals and exaggerated characters, and a death-defying scramble atop Tower Bridge, which is unfinished. It's great for today's action fans, as well as the same 12- and 13-year-old boys we were when we first saw Lock, Stock and Snatch. This hugely liberty-taking extravaganza achieves the exotic state-of-the-art tradition of full-energy action and preposterous CGI, and Holmes and Watson do their best to adjust. Holmes discards the hat and pipe, and Watson has resolved at long last to leave the ironic harmony of Holmes' digs for the perils of married life.Holmes, way more than James Bond, Batman, Tom Ripley and the characters of Shakespeare, has endured innumerable portrayals. Robert Downey Jr., who is not the most insignificant of these. Downey's Holmes is both less restrained and in better physical shape than past personifications. Holmes' accepted fondness for cocaine is here increased by other drugs and lots of alcohol. However Holmes has the physique of a vigorous gymnast, the precision of an acrobat and the fisticuffs of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee. He and Watson bounce effortlessly into action like Batman and Robin.In the opening sequence, the two barge forth upon the diabolical satanist Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, a great actor, great at playing villains, who here is at his most awkward. They arrive as he is performing a despicable deed, and he is sent to the gallows and enclosed in his tomb, just to return evidently not dead. This mobilizes not as much of a line of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills as a succession of martial arts and mass destruction tableaux in the streets of London, which have never appeared more doomed, cloudy and foreboding. I had the feeling the Hughes brothers were filming From Hell on the other side of the block. Now I will concede that there is a particularly awesome classic-Ritchie moment that merges Holmes' masterful deduction and whiplash pugilism, super slo-mo and voice-over taking us through his logical steps of incapacitating a fight opponent, followed by a sudden blur of motion where all of that is executed. High point of the movie.After the first capture of Blackwood, Holmes retires to his abode. In recognized Sherlock lore, this is usually described as 'a period of study,' inferring cocaine and opium fantasies. In Ritchie's version, he ravages his rooms like an inebriated coed, merely just missing old pizza boxes. This will not do. Supposedly, Sherlock is chiefly meticulous. At any rate, Blackwood's revival is just the sort of mystifying black magic front one does expect from a Holmes story, and it gives him a new inducement of life.There is also concern for two women: Rachel McAdams playing the Holmes character alleged to be the sole woman to ever reach Holmes' soft spot, and Kelly Reilly playing Watson's betrothed, who may be in for more than she realizes. The dawn of Mary on the scene throws Holmes into bitter outbursts: How dare the doctor favor a woman over his own scintillating companionship? Watson has invariably assumed proper domain elsewhere, but in this film, the intimate habitat of Holmes' place make his other rooms appear more than ever like a front.The Conan Doyle stories are still read, and likely will be forever. Most readers get to one or two. But among moviegoers of the 09-10 winter season, not so many seem likely. But it seemed to me the majority of us were nonetheless amused for a couple of hours, including myself. Ritchie, his writers and Warner Bros. simply appear to be chiefly concerned with action. That, they unfortunately believe, is all that gets young audiences into theaters today. If that's all they give them, they're going to be correct in time anyway. However, the master of deduction, who has endured so much, can surely bear with some explosions and kung fu.",6,0,2,1 May 2010
WALL·E," Friendship, Love and Working Together vs. Consumerism and Corporate Greed
","WALL-E is an extremely accessible and emotionally touching family film that tells its story more in accordance with its medium than so many movies most older people would honestly rather see. There is something essential, fundamental, stimulating about a movie without any dialogue for its first half: It is telling its story with, guess what, images! And what magnificent images they are. They have centuries of history to them, centuries in our future. Long, long before the film opens, a megacorporation, perfectly named Buy n Large, assumed every economic use in the world, including the government, as one would think of course inevitable. Filled by unrecycled waste, the planet has been so polluted that for seven hundred years, life has been unsustainable. In an attempt to keep humanity alive, the Buy n Large CEO, played in live action on a 700-year-old city screen by Fred Willard, sponsored a five- year exodus from Earth aboard a fleet of starliners that would support every need with a robot crew. Hundreds of thousands of waste-disposal robots were left behind to clean up the planet by compacting the trash into cubes and stacking them into skyscraper-like towers for easy disposal. However, this plan was rejected when Forthright determined that Earth was too contaminated for return to ever be possible. Now, only one of these robots remains operational. That history alone makes our title character one of the most crushingly tender characters ever to be portrayed in the movies.Centuries of lingering activation have given this individual robot consciousness and a sense of interest in things. He collects centuries-old things, things that in this film's world which is so real we feel are so foreign regardless of our daily familiarity with them. This robot, WALL- E, finds them interesting among the mountains of garbage and waste, pragmatically accumulates spare parts for himself from other inactive WALL-Es, and often watches a VHS of Hello, Dolly!. As he continually watches it at the end of each day, we realize that he is developing emotion, paying particular attention to the doing of holding hands, which he deciphers to be an act of showing love. With no one with whom to hold hands, WALL-E, for the first time in centuries, feels lonely.We love this robot for the same reason we love dogs. And I do not simply mean that he is cute, but there is innocence, nobility and unconditional love projected by the cuteness. His eyes are a luminously brilliant touch: He doesn't really have a head so much as he has two steel-encased lenses upon steel stilts, and these lenses can tilt into an arch, which makes him look adorably pitiful. The little guy can draw his limbs into his body and create a cube when he senses danger or when he is resting. He experiences romance, real and powerful romance, and goes on an adventure, none of which is alluded to us any more than to WALL-E himself.What's more, as such an accessible and emotionally involving movie, it unravels into a hilarious, and quite daring, satire undertaking a direly relevant ecological agenda. There are critics who have said that it does so with a lightness of touch that allows you to accept or ignore the message. This is not true. Besides, if someone ignores the message of the film, it is not because the movie wants them to. Its confrontation with the issues it faces is evidenced by the outrage of Conservatives who have called it partisan propaganda, or that Disney and Pixar have spent millions of dollars on a film to announce an offense to its consumers. There is something noble and vital about the lengths to which society will go to telegraph the topical agenda of environmentalism.The way the movie sees it, after centuries of living in micro-gravity aboard spaceships, humans have lost significant bone mass, causing them to be too obese to stand or move without robotic assistance. Even the ship's commander, voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin, has entrusted all his duties to the ship's robotic autopilot, an obvious homage to HAL 9000. The unique behavior the action of the story brings aboard the ship causes the humans to act outside their standard routines, much to their delight. So the filmmakers do not necessarily see humans as inflicting the evil of mankind as some Conservative critics have claimed, but as creatures dangerously prone to routine and subjugation. Having entrusted their existence to a robotic autopilot and robotic servants and assistants of all necessary kinds, they have finally submitted themselves to the dominant power of constantly advancing technology for the sake of their own luxuries. The filmmakers do not necessarily see the toxic excess of waste to be a product of human evil, but of human lack of initiative or awareness, of the training, indoctrinating nature of constant, privileged routine.",10,1,3,28 September 2008
The Good Shepherd," A Lonely and Friendless Man Bred by His Own Fabrication and Lies
","I've been really picky with movies as time has gone on, sort of being less generous with how I rate movies that I see. The more of an authority on something you are, the more critical and knowledgeably harsh you can be. The last movie I saw, and I see at least about ten or fifteen new ones every week, that I would rate 10 out of 10 that I'd seen for the first time I saw October 6, and that was The Departed, and even though I rated it 10 out of 10, I still have had to learn to live with the original score, which is fine but so light for such a heavy film and kind of a waste of Howard Shore. I'd commented here on IMDb for The Graduate and Raging Bull, but both I'd seen before. I've finally seen another one for the first time that I cannot help but rate that high, and that is The Good Shepherd. It is fantastic.I guess it's no wonder why Robert De Niro is, as a director, possibly one of the finest of the past half-century. Yes, he's that good. I think it's because ever since 1967, he's been taking direction from nearly every legend there is. When he was barely making it in the late '60s, early '70s, he was working with De Palma, then he got with fellow Italian-who-grew-up-on- the-streets Scorsese, and also worked with Alan Parker, of course Coppola, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Michael Cimino, Tarantino, John Frankenheimer, Alfonso Cuaron, Ron Howard, snitch-but-good-director Elia Kazan, et al. For almost 50 years, he's been constantly watching it done by the best. If you think about it, he's learned the best way you can.The cinematography is perhaps the best I've seen all year. Somehow, the film captures atmosphere and holds it, never letting it escape for one second, and slowly it segues from atmosphere to atmosphere, subtly changing not its mood but its feeling for its surroundings, almost as if we are actually there standing with the characters. The slow, patient musical score never falls into the trap every other espionage film falls into, letting the orchestral music become tainted by electronic noises and techno beats, to the point where it's nothing but a violin or two and a cello repeating a few catchy bars while the drum machine takes over. The Good Shepherd has an emotional, elusive symphonic underscoring. The script is extensive, extremely subtle, and rich in its drawing of its characters.The film's star, Matt Damon, continually proves himself to be one of his generation's finest actors. He never takes a wrong step, or at least he hasn't for a very long time. Just this year, he matched and paralleled his co-star in The Departed, and almost precisely a year ago he was, to my surprise, a highlight of Syriana. Even though he's made some roles his own and has really impressed before in films such as The Talented Mr. Ripley and Rounders and I've never had a bias towards him for any reason, I simply nearly always would prefer to see another actor in his place. He's never stricken me as a particularly deep individual, thus I always see Matt Damon rather than the role being played by Matt Damon. However, he is really beginning to grow on me. His performance here in The Good Shepherd is one for the books. He becomes the shelled, withdrawn yet completely assured man that he plays.Angelina Jolie may give her finest performance in this film, her character so deeply sympathetic to us. Crudup in his seeming new wave of clean-cut refined roles, De Niro himself playing an unusually humble and minimal character, and even Joe Pesci in a return from eight years off screen in a scene as an Italian-American, are all very convincing performances and very very high points their careers.",10,7,13,25 December 2006
Stalag 17," Pure Entertainment From the Silver Screen Master
","Stalag 17, though only a good ol' American testosterone-driven entertainment, is a great piece of direction on the part of the true master it bears at the helm, Billy Wilder. Wilder flaunts the atmosphere of a screwball comedy, and fires off a lot of gags you would probably only find in one. Simultaneously, he builds very stern suspense with inherent tension and subtle mechanisms set by a few characters.The film's plot screens a lot of very tense things that get us all worked up. It's about a character that deals with false accusations by an entire POW camp full of men that while they're in prison at least have each other. This character does not. He's excluded, beaten, and can only think about that one character who is smugly getting away with all that he's being accused of. And then again, in the undercurrent, there's this interesting crop of quirky characters that populate the stalag. There's a big, scruffy lug named Animal who looks like an American Danny Trejo and could break a few chains apart at once, but he's got an insufferable crush on Betty Grable, and when the news is heard that Grable is married, Animal falls apart. He's got a smaller friend with a higher voice who gets caught up in mishaps with him, like a mixture of Abbott and Costello and George and Lenny from Of Mice and Men. Then there's a guy who shows up at the camp who can do impressions of any actor, and does throughout the film.Stalag 17 is a great American counterpart to Grand Illusion, perhaps. The only difference is that Stalag 17 all but ignores the war and closes in completely on the characters themselves, using the period in time as an incidental part of the plot. It's pure entertainment, and beautifully done by a master of such.",8,2,4,25 July 2007
Platoon," Stone's Masterpiece
","When we see films about fighting in WWII, we see bonding and camaraderie. When we see films about fighting in Vietnam, we see vindictiveness, rape, power plays and questionable loyalties. Filmed with a mixture of subjectivity, as we never leave the journey of the story's particular platoon, and objectivity, as Stone tracks with them from a distance through leaves and bushes, Platoon epitomizes the Vietnam experience. Stone may have based restless but controlled Charlie Sheen's Taylor character on himself, and the film may revolve around him- --and one or two long takes indeed do just so---yet his experience is deeply felt by all of the characters. As he becomes more and more hardened by his journey into the heart of war, Taylor finds himself brusquely wavering between those who gravitate fearfully toward Barnes, an indestructible and forbidding return to one's earliest primordial nightmares, played by Tom Berenger, whose acute perception communicates the intimidating feeling of Barnes' presence, and those who gravitate toward Elias, a sagacious and optimistic veteran, played with self-contained receptiveness by Willem Dafoe, whose compadres, similarly cool and detached, share his accepting aura. These two characters are rivals with every ounce of willingness to mortally conquer one another.What are alluring are the clues Stone leaves of the ideologies of the two dominant men. The separate congregations of troops, killing time till plodding on the next scorching day, are introduced together consecutively, and again overlap each other before we again see them enmeshed with each other as a seemingly unified single platoon. Taylor is welcomed into a world of pot smoke, nostalgic tunes and philosophical aphorisms in Elias' hut, where Taylor's existential comfort finds itself going to rejuvenate. We later hear Elias say to Taylor, 'I love the stars. There's no right or wrong in 'em. They're just there, man.' Barnes, on the other hand, shares his quarters with men who escape no further from the ever-crystallizing reality of their situation than knocking back beers and playing endless rounds of claustrophobic card games. We see a Confederate flag and a Jesus shrine respective of two peripheral bunkmates here. None of them, at any rate, have any patience for understanding the enemy or the man fighting with them, only enough to digress into the kill-or-be-killed level of fear- and rage-fueled thought processes. So there we have it: the accepting mentor and the intimidating idol, the one who awaits and welcomes free association and the one who lethally forbids anyone to get, or happen to be, in his way, and thus disrespect him. The blue team and the red team, the never-ending Civil War blurring the distinctions from the nameless, faceless savages they must kill to survive. Indeed, there is seldom a certain, indisputable shot of an enemy soldier.In other Vietnam films like Casualties of War, there is a characterization of good and evil cast upon certain characters who do despicable things outside the bounds of their duty and certain ones who react righteously to them. In Stone's inarguably most personal, semi- autobiographical work, we spend the first half hour coming to like several soldiers whom we, and Taylor, find to have monstrous sides once Barnes leads them into terrorizing an alleged Viet Cong village in what is considerably the most disquieting sequence. They are just like you and me. They are not just dramatized characters.There is the invariable angst that any motion affords a coin-toss prospect between a protected place or a threatened one. This film easily being the peak profit of Stone's craftsmanship, he assembles his shots to exclude the notion that combat coalesces consistently. Rather than combat sequences in which lines are distinctly evoked, his battle sequences comprise 360 degrees: Any blast or fired round might be aimed at friend or enemy, and in the frantic urgency of combat, many of his soldiers never have a definite conception of precisely who they are shooting at, or why.There is the music, not only the diverting jams of the era, but a romantically somber orchestral throughline which Stone places with instinctive wisdom. Georges Delerue's gentle, compliant and deceptively vulnerable score sneaks in and out of the periphery. Similarly, the receptive humanitarian zeal of Samuel Barber's Adagio For Strings becomes a relentlessly emotive servant of the universal concerns awakened on screen.Stone essentially implies the U.S. lost the war in Vietnam owing to tensions within its own forces and a disinclination to go all the way, which leaves one with the dreadful consequence that the measureless anguish and upheaval was for nothing. Stone was able to depict the abomination of war without ever stylizing them. Rather, the effect is all-encompassing chagrin, a generation lost in a conflict that it didn't actually believe in, a generation of young men fighting for a country that didn't truly regard very highly or have a procedure for what was really going on rapt in the jungles, within their own platoons. This was the story we needed to see. It would be the first in a trilogy of Vietnam War films from Stone which penetrated the bilious innards of the Vietnam predicament to present a succeeding generation of Americans and for all those who were alive then the reality and the underhandedness of such a war.",10,2,4,14 July 2009
Scream," A 'Wes Carpenter' Flick
","The characters in Wes Craven's meta-fest are in a horror film, and since they've seen so many horror films, they know what to do, and what not to do. 'Don't say 'I'll be right back,'' Jamie Kennedy cautions a friend, 'because whenever anybody says that, he's never right back.' In a way, this movie was unavoidable. A lot of modern film criticism concerns plot deconstruction. Kevin Williamson's script does this to itself, using conventional slasher procedure with an ironic combination of genuine scares with dialogue that satirizes slasher film customs: Rather than leaving it to the audience to expect the horror banalities, the characters discuss them candidly. 'Horror movies are always about some big-breasted blonde who runs upstairs so the slasher can corner her,' says a character in this reference-happy film. 'I hate it when characters are that stupid.' The movie starts with Drew Barrymore at home alone, naturally. She gets an abusive phone call. All in all, she gets the Janet Leigh Treatment. It's a dry run.Then, we meet another young woman. Her father has left for the weekend. Her mother was murdered . . . why, precisely a year ago tomorrow! Her boyfriend climbs in through the window. At high school, grapevine of cult killings spreads. The killer masquerades in a creepy Halloween costume. There are more phone calls, more attacks. The suspects include the boyfriend, the father, and a lot of other people. The Fonz as the high school principal is a likable little dash.All of that is the plot. This revitalizing tongue-in-cheek genre piece is not about the plot. It is about itself. That is to say, it is about characters who are aware they are in a plot. These characters read Fangoria magazine. They even use movie-style dialogue: 'It's called subtlety! You should look it up!' or 'I was attacked and nearly filleted last night.' or 'Life is like a movie. Only, you can't pick your genre.' The heroine has been declining her boyfriend's advances, and as another character brings up, virgins are never victims in horror films. Just bad boys and girls get slashed to pieces. Understanding they're among the thick of a slasher plot, the characters talk about who could play them, Tori Spelling, a young Meg Ryan. The movie itself, for all of its unexpected in-jokes, also works as a horror movie, a bloody and gruesome one, that employs as many clichés as it parodies, usually the same ones. That is it's wittiest charm: By exposing the conventions of the genre, the audience expect something else to happen, but the film then plays by those very same conventions.One old linchpin is the scene where someone abruptly enters the frame, scaring the heroine, while a menacing musical chord stings. These scenes are ripe for parody, because the chord carries a theme of emergency, but in fact the surprising person is always an innocent friend, and although we can't see the newcomer because the framing is so tight, in the real world the scared person would naturally be able to see the newcomer all the time. Williamson is also educated about the way TV reporters are depicted in horror movies. The reporter this time, played by Courteney Cox, canvases delightful inquiries, such as 'How does it feel to be almost brutally butchered? People have a right to know!' As dogged and crafty as she is, she still touts to a local deputy that they shouldn't drive to a remote country house when it's a nice night to walk down an unoccupied rural trail in the dark while a slasher is loose.As a cinephile, I liked it. I liked the in-jokes and the behavior-conscious characters. At the same time, I'm disappointed in how many audiences have been duped into taking it seriously. It is truly ironic that it indeed resuscitated the entire horror genre and spawned countless take-me-seriously imitations. Even fellow filmmakers made a franchise out of spoofing it, when it's already a spoof. It's the violence and the gore, which are plentiful and sometimes intense, that deliver on the same note as it would if it were a normal cash-in slasher. The key is that the graphic violence and gore are disarmed by the ironic way the film utilizes and annotates it. Craven and Williamson have their cake and eat it too.",8,0,1,19 May 2010
Halloween," No Better Than Most Slashers
","Halloween is good because of its autumnal atmosphere, its small town setting, its fascinating killer, and its infectious and constantly cloned musical score. An autumnal atmosphere is great for a horror film because summer is not scary. Summer is a hot, sunny time when everyone's out playing soccer. A small town setting is great for a horror film because a big city has so many people in it that no matter what happens, it's not scary because the character is not alone in a claustrophobic place. Michael Myers is a fascinating character because of Donald Pleasance's intermittent monologues about him, the chilling voyeuristic shots where we see what he sees but with a slice of his silhouette on the side of the screen, and everything about this character that we slowly learn. He is truly the most interesting and well-developed slasher movie killer. The musical score is a pulsing, as I said, infectious piano that can never be imitated. Even The Exorcist's equally effective score with its similar use of the piano is much different in the moods it sets and portrays.Halloween was the start of the slasher subgenre of horror films. It has these good qualities. However, that does not make it so much better than the others. It happens to be very very very corny, at times very implausible, and no better at directorial technique than Friday the 13th, or slashers hardly anyone's seen or even heard of anymore like Black Christmas or When A Stranger Calls.The reason it's so well-received is because of the tremendous following that it started. People were truly scared by this new approach to horror, and it started the subgenre of slasher. Black Christmas, however, only 4 years earlier, made for a very creepy and unusual slasher-oriented approach, and flew below the radar. Halloween is a decent enough horror film, especially considering how dated it is, but it's very overrated and hogs the slasher spotlight.",8,0,1,24 September 2006
Carrie," Even the Sharpest and Most Vicious Revenge Films Can Still Not Feel Like Enough
","Carrie is one of Brian De Palma's greatest achievements, because his sequences of suspense are some of the most tense and gripping and teeth-gritting that I've ever seen. I think he spends a little too much time on prolonged, embellished sequences of lush shots of Sissy Spacek's body as well as a few others, but his suspense evens it out.I just wish Carrie's final breaking point where she uses her telekinesis to slaughter all of those who hazed, humiliated, and devastated her was as prolonged as his almost aggravatingly wanton opening shower scene or the walk through her house near the end, or other scenes of that nature. Why, in a film about vicious unleashing of cold, hellish vengeance and wrath on the meanest possible people who play the meanest prank or con or sham I've ever seen on film does the rising action have to be so overlong and without an at least minimally violent forewarning and why does the pay-off have to be so short and to- the-point?Really! What's wrong with that scene of almost orgasmic wrath upon the people at the prom being fifteen minutes long, focusing in on each and every person who has in the film specifically picked on her and their brutal deaths? Nancy Allen's gabby friend cracking up at the dousing of the pig's blood simply being hosed down? Why was she not hosed so hard that she was elevated with such force from the house against the wall that she started vomiting blood or dying of suffocation? The snobby, immature teacher who made cruel fun of Carrie's comment in class being electrocuted for, what, six or seven seconds? How about being fried to the point of his skin turning to a crisp? And especially Nancy Allen and John Travolta! The cruelest and most unbelievable vicious characters in the movie just get blown up in their car?! They seriously should have been turned over in their car by Carrie's telekinetic powers, yes, but the car should of just caught aflame, which should've slowly engulfed the car as Carrie uses her mind to crush the car into a smaller, tighter place where there is no escape, so that the two evil people are forced to watch Carrie's saucer-sized eyes of retribution as they slowly burn to death in a cramped space with broken bones? And Carrie's mother should've been crucified with even more knives. Even more, yes. Even one in her eye.Carrie deserves the cruelest, most inhuman revenge ever heard of up till 1976. Why not?! The whole movie up until her breaking point is about her horrible suffering and being sheltered in a terrible psychologically debilitating way by her mother. The audience deserves more than what they get in the climax. The movie is great, and the revenge is sweet, but if only it could've been a little more.Whether you like the film itself or not, you should at least admire Pino Donaggio's wonderful score. It's fantastic and works beautifully.",8,2,3,26 September 2006
Raging Bull," Life as a Boxing Match
","Robert De Niro, no matter what lesser films he's been in since and how marginal a few of his performances may have been in them, he will never be less of an actor than he is as Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. He is authentically disturbing, entirely becoming this awful man, transcending the universe. He does not play anything he does on screen. He is everything he does on screen. He lives and breathes his performance, and you realize that his portrayal runs so deep that it's no longer a performance in the traditional sense. It is haunting in a way that you must see to believe. I have never seen anything like it. There is a scene near the end of the film that makes me cringe reflexively, but all we really see is his silhouette.The opening shot---the dim, hazy slow-motion shadowboxing of LaMotta's shrouded figure, the tops of the judge's heads barely visible through the shadows of the background, out of which the sporadic flash of a bulb will momentarily disperse---is not even a moment in time so much as a corner sketch of a moment in time, playing on endlessly and savoring itself. And it's a moment of heightened reality in the routine of a boxer: Those moments pumping up ringside before the fight begins. Scorsese manages to present his film with a moment so abstract and yet so pared down that many impressions such as mine can come of it. It's pure feeling.The character that proceeds to pervade every scene subsequent is not just a crass, angry man with hang-ups. From the moment we see this man's domestic life, the way he treats his miserable wife and loyal brother, we see abominable behavior and not a single redeeming value. It's what generates such a potent undercurrent of unease in his tender, tranquil first scenes with Vicki, his gorgeous 15-year-old future punching bag who is filmed like an unsullied angel and thus seen as one by this brute, who is for the first time we've seen acting polite, friendly and gentle. But when he gradually lures her into sitting on his lap, we see a controlling compulsion in romantic affection's clothing, much like the terrifyingly gentle, placid scene in Cape Fear between Juliette Lewis' coy teenage girl and another manipulative De Niro sociopath. It's the precise sort of tension Scorsese builds throughout his textile of LaMotta's vicious soul, an undercurrent of his true bleak colors beneath the uneasy serenity.The sudden, random violence that explodes incidentally and in the background of Jake's life is more than just part of a tableau of mean neighborhood streets of the New York Scorsese knows, as with other films in which he similarly uses shocks of realistic violence as a virtual aspect of production design. The shocking riot breaking out in the Cleveland match that opens the film, the brawls and arguments Jake and his brother pass by without reacting, the top-of-the-lungs fight Jake has with his wife ats which no one on the street bats an eye, these are the tableau of Jake's limited, insulated inner world. These are the things that he sees so regularly that his world can't make sense without it.It's not a story of boxer Jake La Motta's life. It's a story of Jake La Motta's congested aggression and debilitating sexual hang-ups and how they affected his career in the ring. He would fight like he didn't deserve to live. He would punish his opponents like they were the root of his paranoia and anguish, and he would take beatings and punish himself for what he'd done wrong. This is inarguably Scorsese's darkest film. It broods deeply, much quieter and much more claustrophobic than any other film he's made.",10,1,3,25 December 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," An Artistically Complex, Penetratingly Intimate Drama Leaning Towards the Thriller Genre
","Broodingly, intimately and truthfully shot, quietly edited, with a gloomy orchestral score and a richly commanding cast everywhere from Hopkins and Foster's obvious milestones to Scott Glenn and Ted Levine, this artistically complex, penetratingly intimate movie is a masterpiece in all departments. I do not categorize it as a horror film. Maybe a suspense thriller, because whenever I watch it, I view it as such, but the reason it is so compelling is because it is not genre-specific. Yes, it is scary, it is suspenseful, especially in its heart-exploding climax, and our fear of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is established as soon as he appears for the first time, as FBI cadet Clarice Starling reticently passes the maximum security cells of clearly demented ward occupants, and director Jonathan Demme cuts to her point of view as she arrives at Hannibal's cell at the end of the dank corridor, and he is awaiting her already, standing with perfect posture, a pleasant, polite look on his face. His speaking voice has the care of a man having transcended the common cognizance that he can hardly be concerned to speak to the slack acumen of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, affording fear to scenes that do not even have to do with him.There is so much to say about Hannibal Lecter, as a character, as a villain, as a person. But rather than doing so, I shall simply say that the reason Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs as a film works incomparably better than Ridley Scott's Hannibal or Brett Ratner's Red Dragon, in the sense of portraying Hannibal in the most powerful and mystifying way, is because it tries to create sympathy for him through his charm, his incredible intelligence, his creative cultivation and his penetrating insight into the mind with all five senses, then turn the monster loose. Accordingly, there are moments when Lecter commits brutally violent acts, but Demme and the adapting screenwriter Ted Tally wisely let a little go a long way, with the foreseeing intention that the long-term impact is of his evil psychological strength.Most of the best stories never started from ideas but always from character. I firmly believe that The Silence of the Lambs is an offshoot straight from the creation of Hannibal Lecter. Even as rich and sympathetic and real as Clarice Starling is, she is a projection of what Dr. Lecter would find fascinating, how he would affect an eager but inexperienced rookie's undertaking of a critical case.The Silence of the Lambs is not simply a horror film because of its involvement of two psychopathic serial killers but because of its organic use of the great common phobias and fears. Here is a story involving not only cannibalism and skinning, but also kidnapping in the least likely situation, one that will shatter one's trust and sense of good samaritanship, being trapped in the bottom of a well, the details and anatomy of decomposing corpses, large insects, being lost in the dark, being tracked by someone you cannot see, not being able to get people to believe you, people who know your deepest secrets, beheadings, bizarre sexual perversions, and being a short woman in an investigation otherwise led completely by tall men.Demme is aware of the pitfalls of shock value and exploitative horror film techniques, but does not hesitate to take chances. His first scene with Hopkins could have gone over the top, and in the hands of a lesser actor almost certainly would have. But Hopkins is in the great British tradition of actors who internalize instead of overacting.Jodie Foster is unavoidably upstaged by Hopkins's fertile and horrific conception, but her stability, natural sensitivity and stealthy backbone are at the core of the film's resolve. Real and attention-grabbing facets lurk within her character as they do in any one of us: She is one age group ahead from white trash, as Lecter precisely conjectures, she tries to camouflage her southern accent, and she has to rally all of her nerve and fabricated confidence to instruct a room full of coarse small town lawmen out of an autopsy room. This gripping and incessantly developed drama has a nuance of unsolicited male attention toward her. Hardly ever in a movie have I been made more alert to the understated sexual burden men instill in women with their eyes. Ideally, if you're going to have a character appear in a story long enough to glance at a woman, pass by at the wrong time, take a picture or anything to such a minuscule effect, they had better be real enough that you can guess what they ate that morning. The makers of The Silence of the Lambs understand this.",10,1,1,28 October 2008
X-Men: First Class," Superpowers of the Literal Kind In Strangelove's War Room
","The most persuasive acting in Bryan Singer's classy revenge on Fox is by JFK, who in his 1962 message to the nation conveys thanks for the triumphant end of the Cuban Missile Crisis while stifling what he certainly must know, that American and Soviet missiles spent a lot of time soaring back and forth while telepathically manipulated by the remarkable powers of mutants. The movie's use of the missile crisis definitely performs the function of founding this prequel in the early 1960s and fulfills the doubt of whether or not reality intersects with the chronicles of superheroes.Mainly owing to the manner of young-at-heart, Brit-grit oomph director Matthew Vaughn sopped up from his roots in Guy Ritchie's super-slick capers, the movie is state-of-the-art and features a few good performances from a few actors whose abilities could've elevated this overreaching artistic cross-promotion, with plenty of action and racket as it renders the genesis of the X-Men, a troupe of roughly a dozen mutants, hitherto. It opens in a Nazi concentration camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is made to behold a heartbreaking act of cruelty and discovers he can manipulate metals with his mind, but just when he's enraged. He grows up to be Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the sinewy Irish actor who the rumor mill says will become a big star after this movie. For god's sake. He is already truly first-class. But he only becomes well-known after playing Magneto? Moreover, Raven is played by Jennifer Lawrence, recently nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The cost of prominence. Why is she great in Winter's Bone and yet so boring here? At Oxford, we meet James McAvoy's telepath Charles Xavier as a young man, not yet a paraplegic. He'll ultimately oversee a school to protect and educate mutants, and he dreams they can relieve the world. His nemesis is Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw, Magneto's merciless oppressor in the Nazi camp.Other mutants are assembled into one fold or the other. Each one has a specialty. There's your shape-shifter, a hurricane-hurler, a screamer, a fire-shooter, a swift acclimatizer, named Darwin, sure enough, etc. That each would cultivate a distinctive capability through concurrent transformation is a toll of the intelligent design of Stan Lee and his Marvel Comics gang. Nevertheless, it must be limiting to just have one stunt. You need to move with a clique to deal with all given aspects of a given situation.The plot entails efforts by Rose Byrne's CIA agent Moira McTaggert to exploit Xavier to fight Shaw, who poses a menace to world peace. Precisely how the CIA came across the mutants is a bit vague. Certainly the agency exists basically as an expediency for the script, and the basis for Moira, who appears to really like Xavier, and as a telepath, he should know.In any case, the fate of the good and evil mutants cross with the Missile Crisis, which was not entirely as we generally understand it. The scene where the mutants stand on a beach and telepathically spar by causing both American and Soviet missiles to ferry back and forth in the sky is, well, amusing, I was going to say, but no, I should view this scene more seriously.X-Men: First Class is fit weekend distraction that will soon be outdone in the collective fan conscious by the next one and the one after that. It's not a great comic book picture, like The Dark Knight, or a bad one, like RED. It's not in 3-D, which is a clemency. The cast all represents their roles credibly, if not very enthusiastically, and the effects worthily handle those rockets switching directions like characters in Scooby-Do being chased through one door and out another. The combat sequences feature people having awful things happen to them in rather unintelligible ways, but they also make an interesting consistency for Raven the boring shape-shifter.",7,0,1,26 October 2011
Any Given Sunday," It May Be Confused, But It Still Has Its Feet On The Ground
","Oliver Stone's powerful, unique, and densely wide-scope football film is entertaining, effacing, dramatic, and fun, even for people like myself who are not fans of football. However, cinema's arguable master, and if nothing else the first director that comes to anyone's mind, when it comes to organizing an acute and brutally brave and honest sociopolitical argument begins his descent into tapering genius here. His previous films are models of specified statements. The first half of Any Given Sunday is an extreme closeup commentary concering the corporate manipulation, dangerously extreme masculinization, and pride battles of up-and-coming young stars in the NFL. The second half is a feel-good sports movie. The critical stance is gone, save for the Hollywoodized comeuppance in the denouement, which you'll understand when you see the film or if you've seen it. Stone seems muddle-headed. Is he fickle here? Or else what is it that he's saying? He's most certainly saying something, based on the barefaced, clearcut attitude and communication of the beginning. This isn't U Turn, where Stone decided to make nothing more than a thriller. Any Given Sunday seems to double back upon itself.However, that may be the intent of the film. Maybe he's showing the dual nature of football, one side being the gross, purely American Frankenstein's monster created out of stitched together parts of negative characteristics of our country like the domineering, boot camp- like machismo with completely unaware yet glaring homosexual overtones, corporate scandal, and the meeting of egotism and fame, and the other side being a game of passion shared by its players and its fans, where coaches and players are willing to struggle for their place. Altogether as a film, though, this is not a message sent with clarity. Subtlety is one thing. Lack of clarity is another. This film suffers from the latter, as I'm not even sure whether this is the intentional message of the film or not.I may find gaping fault in the film, but as I say at the beginning of this review, I did enjoy it very much. I think the highlight of the entire film is the seven minutes in the locker room before the climactic game where Al Pacino, completely inhabiting his role as a weather- beaten, lonely old coach, gives his team the most inspirational, warm and passion-pumped prep speech I may have ever heard in a sports film, projecting his own unbroadcasted feelings about life into the growing aggression of the monologue where he tells his team that he cannot make them feel one way or another about how they play during the game, but he can tell them flat out that it's a game founded upon fighting and dying for 'that inch we all need.' The film overall is packed with great performances, especially those of Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, and James Woods.Stone's football sequences have the intensity of a roller-coaster ride. There is something subtle about his tailoring of those scenes that makes the players, the field, the ball, the stadium, and the sky seem so large and intimidating, and it works, not diminished by the injection of the overall film's gimmicky cinematographic and editing angles. Stone once again employs the fast-cutting, nerve-filing visual style based on the impressions of the nature of the MTV and VH1 generations of television and media coverage. Perhaps that's why I'm able to excuse the film's unclear voice. Perhaps it's because Any Given Sunday is a sports film, but it doesn't masquerade itself like all the others do, as a sky-blue, miracle-reality, gift-wrapped, feel- good movie that artificially pumps up with emotion and cheer with the slow-motion happiness that seems like it'll last forever. Stone's film is not cynical. It just doesn't want to butter you up, and I respect that greatly, and it's infinitely endearing to me personally to see a sports film with its feet on the ground and no superficial moments for delusional audiences.",8,0,1,30 September 2007
Iron Man," Above Its Mediocrities Is a Great Showcase of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jeff Bridges
","Like its hero, this $135 million total 12-year-old male's chronic nocturnal emission collapses but swiftly regains its balance. What's unlikely about this film is its chosen director, Swingers writer and comic actor Jon Favreau and his convoy of inherently underused actors accept the action-fantasy aim and behave toward it with the slackness and sharpness of improv pleasantry. When they're regurgitating dull expository info dumps, they handle it the way an improv actor would, slickly laying information out into the scene, forging groundwork on which everybody can work, or play, depending on how a professional actor would regard a movie like this.Tony Stark, billionaire industrialist, virtuoso inventor and extravagant playboy, is the successor to Stark Industries, the conglomerate chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, built by his father. He's the personification of the military-industrial development against which Eisenhower forewarned, a monetary Hercules for whom war is just industry, who ensures there will always be a war somewhere. Tony is supposed to be unsavory before he's Iron Man, but he's portrayed as the ultimate leonine prototype for young guys, not only a master dealer and showman but a mastermind who can single-handedly assemble shockingly complex devices and contraptions from scratch.This golden boy is so extraordinarily, exceedingly loaded that the mere idea of money escapes all import. So what if he lives in a literal Jetsons house seemingly suspended on a seaside rock face in Malibu? He still has to fly for lengthy, unexciting spells to get around the world. In his exclusive jet, yes, but isn't it bothersome to be that rich and still embarrassed by the bylaws of reality? He can meet the expense of anything he wants, but it doesn't make things go faster or last longer.Although he has flown his way through more bimbos than he even remembers, Tony's real intimates are the best that money can't buy, but he doesn't seem to appreciate them: We're supposed to think his best buddy is Jim Rhodes, played by Terrence Howard, who is underused in this superfluous role, the military half of a kindergarten-simple military- industrial liaison, but Tony only cuckolds him and Rhodes takes it lying down. His secretary Pepper Potts (for god's sake) cast as Gwyneth Paltrow as if she's somehow more than a token love interest. And his business partner Obadiah Stane (what the hell?) sticks Jeff Bridges with the next most generic caricature, but at least a necessary one.Tony and Obadiah are preventive-war profiteers who have confidence in broadening and asserting one-sided American supremacy through military and economic measures, and give false piety to the sentimental pseudo-patriotism that whatever is good for Stark Industries is good for 'Murica. Tony's turning point he is suddenly held hostage, which is seen as a flash- forward opening sequence, when he starts to realize that there's more to strength and leadership than artillery can ever communicate. Sohebecomes Iron Man? OK, I mean, what could I expect?I think the reason audiences have liked this particular comic book flick is because of Downey. The effects highlight the mass and immensity of his clanging ensemble, and it trust mainstream audiences to be interested by the trouble of aerial steering with formidable thrusters on the bottoms of his feet. But the movie isn't so much a showcase of Iron Man as of Downey. He is a very physical actor who, like Bette Davis, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, runs almost purely on presence. Favreau grasps this. When Tony puts on his Iron Man, we spend as much time inside it with him, listening to his impetuous, cocky voice, as we do watching him rocket through the the heavens or clank about on the ground.Downey has crossed the threshold into a well-merited phase of blessing in his career, where he can't seem to go astray. He's always been incomparable on screen, but presently we're even more delighted to see him. What's more, he constantly brings more to his material than his role necessitates, not that that's a big challenge with this film. Whether a given film itself doesn't match him or is very good indeed, he adds something that makes it something to see: Him.Another appreciated appearance is Bridges, who has spent his career being underused. Thunderbolt & Lightfoot, Cutter's Way, The Fisher King, The Vanishing, The Big Lebowski and even The Morning After substantiate his significance. Obadiah Stane could have been less, a lot less. But Bridges finds bits of behavior, like the way he holds his whiskey glass, in an admirable attempt to transcend a generic character. Really, we find ourselves surprised by his development through the story.",6,1,2,15 December 2008
Blade Runner," A Case of Style Over Substance
","The production design is, from the very first shot to the very last, mesmerizing. It's not so much that you want to be in this beautifully mechanized, steely, Gothic future, but that when a shot changes, you are like a dope fiend whose fix has been snatched away from him right when the last hit was wearing off in that you couldn't take your eyes off of the buildings, vehicles, architectural approach, clothes, and arrangement of everything in the last shot.The unusually effective 1980s synthesizer score has an irresistible hypnotic effect over you, just as Ridley Scott's ominous, foreign atmosphere does. Say you were flipping through channels and came across this movie during one of Vangelis's big moments, one being the final credits, it would be very difficult to go away before he's done.I won't deny it any kudos for its exceptional technical achievement, but I also can't deny my lack of satisfaction with the story itself. A movie can't be driven by its production design. The focus of any film has to be its story.The main premise is very interesting, but never given depth. It seems lathered on top. Blade Runner, despite its status, is a case of style over substance.",9,1,3,13 February 2008
Ben-Hur," A Truly Breathtaking and Perhaps Profound Classic Blockbuster
","William Wyler's powerful giant of a film is not only the most appealing and most bearable of Hollywood's classic biblical epics but also the most well made that I have seen. It does not rise above its kind, keeping in the genre and period tradition of grandiose exhibition and theatrical histrionics, nevertheless this glorious entertainment utilizes these characteristics as well as they could possibly be done within the boundaries of genre, formula and audience. Unlike a Cecil B. DeMille film like The Ten Commandments, exhibition is not exhibitionism but a depiction of its story's large and adventurous scale. Moreover, Wyler does not sacrifice his masterful deep-focus cinematography and gracefully dramatic cuts for the sake of blindsiding the audience with spectacle.The pure degree of this movie, this event, in the days before digitally produced crowds and computer-generated process shots, is almost beyond belief. The film's vivid color, for instance, is insatiable. The chief action sequence, the truly timeless chariot race, remains breathtaking after half a century of visual effects progression, no matter what the cost, even an actor's life. After all, he died for art!As one can see as a definite pattern in Wyler's filmography, Ben-Hur is a memorable revenge tale, one that skillfully avoids two-facedness alongside its religious message of forgiveness. A less than savory person but an undeniably fine actor, Charlton Heston stars as the title character, a Jewish prince whose childhood friendship, and suggested hues of homoerotic attraction, with Messala, played by Stephen Boyd, turns to hate when Messala becomes a Roman officer who willfully betrays him and his family in spite of their loving history together.There is dense substance that I took from the film. Not belonging to any Christian denomination or any religion at all, I found myself to be very enlightened by the film's portrayal of Christ's crucifixion from the perspective of characters not involved in the Bible's stories at all. Although the life of Christ is sketched from his birth to his veiled life to his communal sermonizing to his passion and death, we clearly see or hear him. By the end, I found myself understanding more clearly than ever of what the exchange really consisted when Jesus 'died for our sins.' It is portrayed exceptionally and naturally, just like the film's striking image of the redemptive crucifixion. At the same time, it is done so reverently that it even made the Vatican film list. I wonder if they knew the director was a Jew.",9,2,5,4 September 2008
Casino Royale," Professional Spies Cannot Afford Emotional Involvement
","I think Daniel Craig is a good James Bond, I must say. Because he's blonde or because he's too stern or because he's too emotional are all ridiculous reasons to knock the new Bond. There's always a reason to knock the new bond. Ever since 1973 when Live and Let Die was released minus Connery, there's always been a reason to knock a new Bond. He's blonde, yes, and very young for someone who's been dodging bullets and killing several people all fighting against him at once since 1962, and who has, every two years on average, been doing so relentlessly ever since. He's very agile, strong, sexual, elusive and lacking in gray hairs for someone who should be Sean Connery's age, so there is no point in discouraging Daniel Craig, who has always been a fine actor, from the Bond throne. As for the stern and emotional nature of Craig's 007, that effect is caused by the direction of Martin Campbell, who directed Brosnan as well in GoldenEye. So, Daniel Craig delivers as 007.The problem to be concerned about is its inconsistencies as a prequel. Casino Royale is supposed to be James Bond's very first mission. It begins as he gains double-0 status. However, M is still being played by Judi Dench, whose character is introduced in GoldenEye, the seventeenth Bond film. At the very beginning of the series, M was a barrel-chested, round-headed, feisty yet refined Englishman, played by Bernard Lee. Also, the technology, the portrayal of the political crises, even the brief mentioning of 9/11, all date the film as the most recent and brand spanking new you can possibly make it. This is a huge inconsistency to overlook, so I'm sure that it's in perspective somehow, and I perhaps am uninformed, but equipped with a friend of mine who for months before this movie's release was constantly sending me posters, updated trailers, production announcements, etc., I feel like it would've been difficult to miss something.From the very beginning, Casino Royale is established as a turning point in the Bond series. From now on, we know that the 21st century has completely taken hold of the already very faddish series. The required format for the films is not scrapped, but varied upon. As the film progresses however, you realize that Campbell does not transcend the rest of the series, despite the fact that this is by far the highest point in his own filmography. He and Craig flesh out a Bond that is in his most accurate form. Yes, Connery was the best and Brosnan the second, but James Bond, the way he was initially created, was a dark, mysterious, overconfident, elusive, and guarded rogue, and his weaknesses were the romantic emotions he would learn the hard way to keep in check and the ego that deprives him of the strength to back down or retire from a conflict with humility. Craig hits the nail on the head, and so at times we see a Bond that we simply are not used to seeing. Connery had the darkness, the complicated mystery, the roguish qualities, and yet he was very earthy and coldly suave, sometimes quite mean. Lazenby could've been any other action hero. Moore was all face value; too airily chipper and full of light-hearted English playboy charm, maybe that of a country club regular more than a secret agent. Dalton was the closest to home, but without the charm and suavity. Brosnan was so well-liked as 007 because his portrayal compared so well to Connery's. Craig, perhaps, is better at registering Bond's internal emotion rather than playing it as a cocksure indifference and so we see that rarely recognized true Bond.",8,3,6,24 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Goodbyes are Hard
","I don't think 'good enough' is something that's ever assumed at Pixar. Their labor of love, Toy Story 3, even bids a long-standing justification for careless filmmaking: It's a sequel. In 3D, which thankfully wasn't part of my experience. If truth be told, how good do the studio pushers and enlisted creative staff need to strive for it to be? Well, as it appears, this entire three-part, 15-year blockbuster about the escapades of a cluster of juvenile plastic items has come to be a lingering, melancholy reflection on bereavement, transience and love.As endurers of for example Terminator 3, Live Free or Die Hard and Blues Brothers 2000 understand, too many outings, especially johnny-come-lately sequels, can be the fatal blow for a high-quality franchise. Toy Story 3 has flourished where others have staggered since it has remained faithful to its extraction at the same time it's further developed its scope. And since in ways both major and minor the people behind the series just adore movies. A fantastical rendering of the end of formative years and the consequence of friendship in preserving that warm constancy through life's transformations, this, Pixar's highest-grossing spectacle so far, focuses on the basis for why we constantly revisit the cinematic experience. As written by Oscar-winning Little Miss Sunshine writer Michael Arndt, quite impressive considering the enormous committee of writers typically developing animated films, this transcendent variation on the buddy film manages to suggest danger and excitement as well as unforeseen moments of sorrow. Preeminent, and most distinctive of Pixar on the whole, it grasps authentic feeling and puts it on the screen in a way generationally, culturally and perceptively universal.The circumstances put forward an occasion for a handful of movie gags, a favorite Pixar idiosyncrasy. Look forward to lots of allusions to Cool Hand Luke and The Bridge on the River Kwai. But generally it's an opening to be in these characters' warm company again. An opportunity to meet new acquaintances as well, as Barbie encounters the man of her dreams, complete with a pastel leisure suit and glossy narcissism. It's all pleasurable, but also craftily executed, with an infatuated consideration of nuance. The Ken doll moves precisely like a Ken doll would. The wind-up monkey hits his cymbals in exact, unenthusiastically automatic shudders. Scenes are neatly paced and climaxes develop further climaxes.In some sense, the story of a troupe of toys struggling to meet their duties and confront change, in another a musing on the edge of youth and the value of love in defining the stages in one's life, this epic anthropomorphic love saga persists in achieving the ridiculous by making every age group in every family in North America accept that toys are people too, distinctive individuals with psyches and viewpoints of their own. A reflection on the brink of changing times and the importance of love as continuity between those often truly frightening transitions, it's arguably quite a radical vision for a big movie-going event for whole families. It doesn't gloss over the very real fears it suggests, but deals with them in ways that are liberating for children who weren't born yet when the first two films were released, as well as cathartic for those of us who knew Woody and Buzz as youngsters ourselves. Now, we're Andy's age. And boy, is it tough to say goodbye.",8,1,2,10 August 2011
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," An Open-Minded, Nonjudgmental Portrait of the Boundless Scenarios In Which Love Can Be Found
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is among the cream of the Woody Allen crop, in the midst of Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Match Point. It may even be a wiser film than any of them. What Woody has done throughout his film career is seek the answers to his own life questions in any number of ways. Some later films contradict the philosophical implications of previous ones. Some reaffirm them. His foremost theme has always been the complications of love and sex, and this ultimately genre-less film that I suppose could be considered a romantic seriocomedy may be his magnum opus of his sexual and romantic revelations.Vicky, played by Rebecca Hall, and Cristina, by Scarlet Johansson, go to Barcelona for the summer, settling with Vicky's distant relative (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband. A Narrator, present all through the film, the particular matter-of-fact likes of which Allen has never before used, illustrates the two friends: Vicky is no-nonsense and conservative in her attitude toward love and commitment, engaged to the dependable but less than passionate yuppie. She is in Barcelona getting her masters, and is deeply stirred by Spanish guitar. Cristina, in contrast, is impulsive and irresolute of what she wants in life. She is just out of a relationship and wants to forget about her experience making a short film about Love, perhaps a nod to Woody's own admitted negative reflections on his previous works.At an art exhibition, these two symbolically contrasting women observe a notorious painter, played with suavity and charisma by Javier Bardem. Cristina is immediately fascinated with him, and grows captivated when she and Vicky learn that he has undergone a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later, the girls spot him in a restaurant, where he stoically approaches their table and unexpectedly invites them to go along with him to Oviedo, where they will tour, wine, dine and, with any luck, make love. Straight away Cristina consents, Vicky refuses, but Vicky is is ultimately persuaded and the twosome go with the self- designed artistic and drifting romantic on a small private plane through a rainstorm.What follows is a free-flowing rectangle of romance with any combination of Bardem, Vicky, Cristina, and Bardem's unmanageably volatile ex-wife Penelope Cruz, who deserves an Oscar nomination for her work here. There are many ways in which the two American women change for the better and change not at all. One facet of the story is a clash of conventional American and liberated European cultures. Another is spiritual freedom, signified by Vicky's conventional reticence and thus conflicted feelings that she may be missing out on so much, and Cristina's mutability. A lesser title for the movie but an apt one nonetheless could have been Why Not?Woody is expressing through his characters his urge to be free of all psychological and emotional restrictions. In any case, characters as open as Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem's seem to need similarly adaptable significant others. I find it interesting that Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Woody's women, all brought out their inner nebbishes due to intimate involvement with him, as in his eagerness to lift a lover's state of mind, he ends up, sooner or later, virtually turning his woman roughly into a female version of himself. Johansson and Hall's summer in Spain, if anything, releases them from the sludge of mediocrity, particularly that which results from fear and common custom.By saying all that, I have not even come close to giving anything away. The way things turn out would hardly make sense to characters like Vicky, or her fiancé, and that is what makes it a natural flow from the heart. Woody Allen's brilliantly written, guilelessly directed and convincingly acted Spanish debut-and-swan song is not a comedy for the same reasons as nearly every other comedy Woody has made. It is a comedy essentially because of the culture clash. The film depends on our reactions to things that really are not inherently funny except to unaccustomed eyes. Likewise, the bewildered Americans are just as funny from the other side of the gamut. Without any doubt in my mind, this is not only Woody Allen's best film in years, but one of his very best of his entire 42-film, 42-year career as a writer-director of consistently good films.",9,119,200,13 October 2008
Sweet and Lowdown," Allen Directing Penn? Hm!
","Sean Penn delivers one of his finest performances here as Emmett Ray, who was, or is at least portrayed as, the epitome of the self-centered artist. His art, in this case the guitar, is the one thing the cares about before anything or anyone else. He preserves himself because of the art he lives for. The women who are unfortunate enough to be taken by him are objectified, as he makes it ungracefully and perfectly clear to them that it's their responsibility to change, move, and provide help for him and not at all the other way around. He has a much-talked-about but never-admitted feeling of inferiority to another guitarist, who is quite famous and known as the greatest guitar player in the world, whom Ray fainted in front of both times he saw him perform. The motif of the film is how he absolutely never lets any of his feelings go expressed, keeping them all sealed tightly inside of him, for if he let himself care about anybody else, there goes the thoroughly focused passion that drives his art. The outstanding element of Penn's wonderfully intriguing performance is how he expresses unexpressed emotions and keeps a sympathy and lack of judgment consist in the audience towards such a brutally selfish person.I was not at all interested in the subject matter of this film before I saw it. I only wanted to see it because I am going through a big Woody Allen phase. Woody Allen, one of the finest writers and filmmakers in the world, has a way of writing and directing dialogue so that no matter what off-the-wall one-liner is delivered, everyone sounds so real that you naturally grow to care for them and become very involved and interested in what will happen to them. We care about what horrible thing one character does to another, yet we care about both of them.One of the film's highlights is Samantha Morton, who some time ago stood out in The Libertine, perhaps further out that even Johnny Depp did. She plays a mute girl that loves Emmett Ray unconditionally, and her performance is full of bright-eyed, nearly tearjerking selflessness.Uma Thurman, as always alluring, and Anthony LaPaglia, playing the sort of role one could immediately see him in in reality, arouse anger for us, mostly for the inexplicable care we have for Penn. Sweet and Lowdown is a quick and entertaining detour by a filmmaker who constantly impresses me.",8,0,0,9 April 2007
The Deer Hunter," Times Have Changed, Thus Has This Film's Effect, But It Is By No Means Bad
","Michael Cimino's curiously hailed classic The Deer Hunter is a three-hour drama in three hour-long acts, a chronicle dropping us into what seems to be the middle of the lives of a group of friends. It is a trace of how the Vietnam War crossed the threshold into numerous lives and distorted them dreadfully without end. What I find wise about this story is its lack of any sort of slant for or against the war. However, times must have changed, because once it was one of the most emotionally devastating movies ever made, and now it is not. That does not mean, moreover, that it is at all a bad film, because it is quite good.I am most certainly disappointed that Michael Cimino became more or less estranged from Hollywood after the disastrous failure of Heaven's Gate, because judging by his work here, he could have contributed so much more to cinema over time. Think about it! Like more European and Asian films have done and American films since The Deer Hunter have scarcely had the confidence to do, Cimino takes his time with the opening scenes at the steel mill and the saloon and especially with the wedding. It's key not just that we come to know the characters, but that we feel immersed into their lives, that the wedding rituals and day-to- day life are more than mere Russian-American fine points. I am sure in 1978 that this technique more than worked.The first act is primarily a wedding celebration as in The Godfather, but made merry by working commonfolk who have come to eat, dance get smashed and bid farewell to the three young men who have joined in the Army. The event lasts for nearly an hour for everyone to become inebriated, and then the newlyweds drive off and the rest of the friends go up into the mountains to hunt, to shoot, to murder, some deer. They are yet at a stage where they believe shooting a gun at an objectified target to be gratifying.Then Vietnam inhabits the screen, all of a sudden, with an abrupt barrage of blasting, blaring racket of helicopter blades, machine guns, and indistinguishable yells and screams, and the second act chronicles the three men's experiences. At the film's heart comes the iconic, and very tense and suspenseful in spite of its familiarity, as they are held captive and forced to play Russian roulette while their Vietnamese subjugators gamble on who will blow his own brains all over the place.Russian roulette develops into the all-consuming representation of the movie: Whatever you can accept as true about the game, regarding its consciously indiscriminate brutality, regarding how it affects the reason and judgment of anyone coerced to take part in it, will be relevant to the war all together. It is shrewd symbolism because, in the story's framework, it renders any philosophical assertion concerning the war redundant.De Niro's character is the one who by some means recovers the power to persevere and to keep Savage and Walken functioning. A great touch of realism is when De Niro comes home and is welcomed uncomfortably by the townspeople. The story moves along, into its third act, into unprecedented territory, but amidst all of that, we find a difference, a big one, in De Niro's attitude when he's out hunting deer.This movie is assumed to be on the subject of countless themes and issues, male bonding, foolishly mechanical patriotism, the demoralizing results of war, the awakening of conscience to violence and killing. It concerns any of those focuses that you want to regard. What is so funny about this film, objectively, as the movie itself is not at all literally funny, is that it has no stance one way or the other on the validity of the war in Vietnam, because it was made afterwards. Everyone realizes the gratuitous wars were wrong afterwards. I would bet that it would have had some sort of slant if it had been made before the war ended. But what it maintains is that we not overlook the casualties of a war.",8,2,5,22 September 2008
Identity," With a World of Better Direction, This Could Have Been a Lot Better
","Identity has the wild unpredictability of the essential horror film, set at a timeworn motel in the middle of nowhere. The only guests have only stopped there because of the same freak accident. Alas, it falls through every cliché trapdoor on the blueprint, entirely preventable ones, too, ones that won't open unless you consciously open them, and its wild unpredictability is relegated to merely an offshoot of its absurdity. We still have fun, and, yes, it is still eerie sometimes, but it too much wants to be our friend. It has a star-studded cast of actors we love, the way it gets to its mindblow twist is through a ridiculous and completely avoidable contrivance in dialogue and moreover, the score is too often superfluous, signaling what we are supposed to feel, and as a consequence we don't have to feel it if we don't want to. The film would have been much more effective, far-fetched points and all, if the tension were allowed to grow genuinely rather than be explained by the underscoring.It has been too long since we've seen the unbelievably sexy Rebecca DeMornay in a mainstream film. Had her performance in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle not been a wake- up call for filmmakers, the very kind that like to makes movies like this? Ray Liotta can by now play this kind of role in his sleep. Alfred Molina is hardly a part of the action and does not get to have the kind of fun as he does with so many other roles, but that is no matter for us simply to joy in seeing him. There is also the character actor John C. McGinley in a high- strung dramatic role, having never before been boring anyway. So this seemingly ambitious psychological thriller has star power which results in our immediate enjoyment instead of our deep involvement.Yes, we are truly wondering how this and that could possibly happen, or who could possibly be responsible, and if so, how? Its script is one step away from being ludicrous with cheap pseudo-impressive buy-offs, but depending on the audience, one could either take the bait and be wowed or laugh out loud at its final unraveling, which is what I did. Basically, you can see that the certitude lies in the hands of a skillful enough director, and, with a world of better direction than James Mangold's, this could have been a lot better.",8,3,5,28 October 2008
Speed," Just the Meat and Potatoes, Please.
","Stripping the action genre to its narrative core, the classic Speed draws equally from the disaster cycle, and is structured upon three extended set pieces in which a falling elevator, a speeding bus and a rushing train fulfill the sensory pleasures suggested in the title. This is what I believe makes Speed such a delightful revisit for us. It's a classic vehicle (pun intended) for a cop riding roughshod (double pun) to foil a scheme, but not inherently about any moral or legal maze, or a vendetta, or good vs. evil. The cops aren't saving the day from the bad guy so much because they're good guys, but because they have the resources and skills to do so. The bad guy himself isn't much more than a blank-slate psychopath and shouldn't be, because the real antagonists are the laws of physics themselves, fifty-storey elevator shafts, the finite nature of a full tank of gas, highways and other sorts of paths that are under construction. Speaking of which, why would a public subway car be on an incomplete track in the first place? So that it can burst through concrete into a street? There aren't detours and shoulders like a bus on an expressway. It would've saved L.A. and 20th Century Fox a few million dollars if Graham Yost's script made more sense. But what makes Speed such an enthusiastically gratifying experience is that it centralizes to the bottom line, inducing the pure effect of causing us to clench up.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are not exactly thespians known for their versatility. They're movie stars who were young and hot in the 1990s, and played relatively the same characters in various scenarios. But neither are incapable of good performances, and Speed seems to embody the very Californian culture that makes their characterizations lend an everyday charm to these two people. Reeves plays L.A.P.D. SWAT specialist Jack Traven as a sweet, dedicated young guy who likely spends the weekend smoking bongs with his surfer buddies in between saving the lives of every hostage before an elevator is sent plummeting to certain destruction and using commandeered sports cars on Los Angeles freeways as his springboard to jump onto a bus full of people that may explode at any moment. It's a relative enough behavioral variation on the same spaced-out surfer dude/stoner/metalhead he'd been playing, but it gives Jack Traven a fast-sketch exposition, a very endearing one, resulting not in an invincibly tough Republican like McClane or Callahan or Rambo but a more vulnerable and contemporary polite guy pushing the limits of his mental and physical endurance to prevent anyone from being killed. Same with Bullock, who plays essentially the same brassy, inadvertently heroic everyday gal with a warm soul, so putting her Annie, with the convenient revoked license for speeding, in the driver's seat where she is responsible for making the fifty-foot leaps in unfinished road and avoiding pedestrians and other oncoming traffic, we have a character who is put to the test of her own mental and physical endurance as well, in a shorthand fashion by a script that cannot afford to slow down.Now, the script does, nevertheless, interrupt itself when it leaves the speeding bus for five minutes or so at a time so that Harry, Jack's mentor/partner/best friend played by Jeff Daniels---yet another familiar actor installing behavioral abbreviation for a character---can compile clues to identify a culprit of whom we're already aware, as well as to elaborate superfluously on a far-fetched potential motive, or when Jack and Annie fall in love amidst a frantic life-or-death endurance trial that lasts under a day. And frankly, Dennis Hopper's ham-fisted mad-bomber extortionist is shown on-screen too often during the speeding bus situation for him to be as formidable as he could've been. Imagine the script were its blade not dulled by extraneous commercial sensibilities, a Speed that was able to give us the necessary result of the redundant on-screen investigation by Harry, a Speed confident and edgy enough to skip B on the way from A to C. But the acting, or more precisely the casting, is efficient enough to develop character in a way that streamlines the action.Jan de Bont, though by no stretch the most consistent or unique, is yet another overseas filmmaker to have come to Hollywood and pumped it up with new inspiration and energy. All in all, what's more crucial than literal everyday people going about literally everyday routines, suddenly finding themselves in danger of dying by explosion, being pulverized, etc.? What could we care about more? We don't have to care that Martin Riggs misses his wife in Lethal Weapon, that John Rambo doesn't want to kill anymore but does, that Dirty Harry has to work with a female partner. We may like these other movies however much, but these are laughably petty concerns compared to people---cops, crooks, tourists, working stiffs, whatever---who have no choice but to struggle or be blown up. That is why Speed, flaws and all, is in a league of its own above other '80s, '90s actioners.",10,3,5,28 May 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Come On, Give Me A Break
","In the Die Hard family, Live Free or Die Hard is the dense but rebellious delinquent cousin who everyone dreads coming to Thanksgiving because he's going to ask somebody to borrow more money. The first three Die Hards had an idea of what they were. They were bloody thrillers about a cop from New York who you wouldn't have to be told is from New York judging by his complete confidence, readiness, and detachment when it comes to any confrontation, even terrorists on walkie-talkies threatening to blow up a building. This cop confronts incredibly smart villains who, William Sadler from Die Hard 2 excluded, are suave, brilliant, and match New York cop John McClaine on a personal level and inevitably share a laugh with him. They also have exciting, blood-spattered yeah-take-that gunfights and mortal physical combat. Live Free or Die Hard is so drunk on Hollywood's shallow mentality wherein they want to have their cake, which would be an attempt at an entertaining movie, and eat it too, eating it being compromising most things that make it a good movie in a bad salesman's attempt at expanding the audience.You will not get a good shoot-em-up, for all you Die Hard fans out there. Instead, you will get a sequence wherein Bruce Willis is driving a semi truck and being attacked by a stealth fighter plane, which only fires missiles when it doesn't have a clear shot, so we can see more highway columns crumble, and only fires its machine guns when it has a clear shot for a missile, so that we can see the truck get ripped up. This is an example of the action sequences in this sudden cash-in idea by a Hollywood exec going to sleep one night and suddenly stricken by the revelation causing a light bulb to appear above his head. Aside from a fun fight between Bruce Willis and Maggie Q that leads to a car tangled in the cables of an elevator shaft, there's no grit, and hardly any real tension, because not only are these million-dollar sequences much more suited for Transformers than a cop movie, but they are so convenient in their improbability that we are hardly worried about McClaine not making it out alright. Everything else in the film is tailored unreasonably for the lazy satisfaction of a shallow audience anyway.Take for instance the goofy subplot involving McClaine's daughter, who is now a teenager. You must remember his hot-and-cold relationship with his wife in the earlier films. (The film doesn't seem to want you to recall much from them, but it doubles back on itself at this point.) His daughter hates him, refuses to acknowledge his existence, refuses to call him, and calls herself Lucy Ginero, Ginero being her mother's maiden name, just to hurt her father. Why? Because. Because why? Ask the screenwriters this and they may think you're speaking in Greek, because there really isn't a credible reason given for such an intense hatred on her part. I'm not excusing McClaine's behavior in his daughter's first scene, because McClaine barges in on her and her date like an overly jealous, bombastic Southern husband. Why he acts this way in this scene is beyond me, but we're supposed to think it's cool, so unfortunately, this sort of forceful way that he acts in this one scene cannot be relievedly written off as the reason his daughter hates him so much.Then, suddenly, when she's in trouble---and you know she's going to be in trouble because this is made clear in the movie's trailer, so don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything---she suddenly starts calling herself Lucy McClaine and telling her dad she loves him and showing him affection and things like that. Oh OK, so as soon as she needs him, she loves him. When he needs her affection and love as his daughter in everyday life after a day of avoiding bullets and explosions, she not only doesn't give it to him, but shows him great hate. What a cold, selfish, extremely fickle little brat she's portrayed as.As for the film's villain, if you're expecting the riveting suavity and calculating control of Alan Rickman or the intimidating cold and German soldier's latent but powerful menace of Jeremy Irons, you'll be disappointed. Instead, you get Timothy Olyphant, who plays another power-hungry computer genius who is frankly weak without his technological prowess, and in essence simply a college-age prep whose heart races and eyes widen when he feels in control, which is in essence an insecurity. Who wants a weak villain after three extremely powerful ones? Olyphant opens his mouth in this odd teeth-showing grimace and his eyes are also squinty but bulging at the same time like a mad scientist's.Also, just on a note of personal preference, I don't often really care for action movies and thrillers where everything is controlled by computers, keyboards, the internet, discs, and chips. I like actioners and thrillers, frankly, like the first three Die Hards, where we're trapped in a skyscraper and have to fight our way down, or the characters are forced to run around a big, endless panicky, rushing city like New York in a race against time. Those are exciting. High-tech thrillers just strike me as show-offy. Perhaps if Bruce Willis brought back John McTiernan, they would've made a Die Hard 4 where we maybe get to see some blood on someone's shirt and a script that works.",6,73,144,16 July 2007
The Producers," 'Bad taste is simply saying the truth before it should be said.' -Mel Brooks
","In 21st Century America, the one feature of The Producers that astounds even today is the boisterous, exaggerated, confrontational impulsiveness of its two lead performances. But in 1968, the film's content was like a suicide bombing of the audience's idea of good manners. There's such greed in its heroes, such merry deceit, such eagerness to concede every ethic, that the 1968 audience just had to surrender, stick with it. How did Brooks get away with that? By proving the dishonorable struggle of both lead characters at the start, by casting them with actors you couldn't help liking. Mostel's Max Bialystock is a man whose yearnings are so measureless they exonerate his voracity. There's a scene where he rubs his grubby office window with coffee, peeps through the dirt, sees a white Rolls-Royce and shouts, 'That's it, baby! When you've got it, flaunt it!' You can drink a tall glass of his gluttonous self-indulgence. 'Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt!' It's characteristic of this movie that after he says the line, he rips off the belt, tears it to smithereens.Mostel, a distinguished thespian, blacklist foil, and academic, here gives a tour de force of low comedy. Regardless of a comb-over that starts just above his clavicle, he propels buoyant egotism, spitting on his hand to slick back his hair before an elderly female investor enters for her weekly frolic. What Mostel propels in particular is unreserved self-assurance. He never has doubts. Maybe he never thinks at all, just simply carries on out of evolutionary necessity.Wilder was a fresh mug in 1968, familiarized to audiences with a significant supporting role in Bonnie and Clyde a year before, also as a rather hysterical character. His performance in The Producers is a tinge short of cardiac arrest. On the floor with Mostel over him, he shrieks, 'Don't jump! Don't jump!' Mostel begins to leap in a flurry. 'I'm hysterical! I'm hysterical!' Mostel pours a glass of water and chucks it in his face. Wilder serves a perfect line: 'I'm wet! I'm hysterical, and I'm wet! I'm in pain, and I'm wet, and I'm still hysterical!' Gene and Zero reel on the floor so violently we expect them to chew on one another. Mostel's so overexcited and feral, Wilder so flustered and frantic, you marvel that slobber didn't get on the camera lens. The entire movie's toned on that plane of turbulent anxiety. One of the delights of watching it is to see how the actors are able to manage timing and distinctions even while shrieking. Timing is in the hands of actors, but without scripts, there would be loads of tedious improvisation. Good timing in the written words is the gateway to good timing on screen. I'm sure we'd be surprised at how snappish the dialogue seems on the page. But Brooks, a veteran nightclub act himself, leaves space for delivery while simultaneously working economically with form. Characters repeat the last thing another character said to extend the laugh. Characteristic of Brooks, that's often what causes the laugh. Language is ecstasy to him.Kenneth Mars is a militant live-action cartoon, up on the roof with his pigeons, singing Nazi songs, later commanding an audience member to stop laughing because 'I am the author! I outrank you!' Brooks includes gay jokes, with the ostentatious couple of Broadway director Roger De Bris and his right-hand Carmen Giya. At one point Max, Leo and Carmen crowd into a teeny elevator, and are ejected breathless and ill-at-ease. Heterosexuality's epitomized by the nubile Lee Meredith, as Ulla, the voluptuous secretary, who types one letter at a time then stops for a pat-on-the-back smile. The other terrific performance is by Dick Shawn as the actor who plays Hitler. In a movie made at the pinnacle of the hipster era, he's a hippie comprised out of archetypal junk scraps, with his finger cymbals, soup can necklace and knee-high shag boots.To produce a musical named Springtime for Hitler is naturally in the worst achievable taste, as an exiting audience member remarks in the movie, to the glee of Bialystock and Bloom, who're depending upon precisely that response. To make a movie about such a musical was also in bad taste, apparently. It's clear that Bialystock and Bloom are Jewish, but they never touch on that. As Franz Liebkind rages, they nod, because the more repugnant he is, the more liable his play will fail. Brooks throws in merely one brief flash to indicate their personal feelings. As the two men walk away from the playwright's apartment, Bloom covers the red-and-black Nazi armband Franz has given him. 'All right, take off the armband,' says Bialystock, taking off his own. They throw both armbands into a garbage can and spit in it.Whilst jabbing at the troubles of Broadway, Brooks' directorial debut's concerned with two overtly Jewish characters who are, in the best tradition of Jewish comedy, doomed to failure, in a film steaming with conflict on every level. Whilst there may be a prominently Jewish-American sensibility about Brooks' work, it's a feature that he's chosen to leave out after this film, apart from the Yiddish Native American chief in Blazing Saddles, the metal detector scene in High Anxiety, occasional comments in To Be or Not To Be and the fictitious trailer for Jews in Space in History of the World Part I. But what he's maintained, and what I feel---having grown up in a family of Brooks fanatics---is what makes a particular generation enjoy him so insatiably, is a pure audacity, mischievous delight, eagerness to leap any bound for a laugh. They'll say, 'Ah, comedy today's all eff this, eff that, fart on this, have sex with that. It's all bad taste.' And I say, look at your boy Mel. He knows better than any of them: Bad taste can taste the best.",8,7,8,13 October 2010
RED," Hostility Towards and Mistrust of Halfway-Decent Storytelling Sense, Smart Moviegoers and the Slightest Investment of Any Aesthetic Value
","RED features noteworthy stars doing things we wish were worthy of any note. Indeed the star turns are this eye roll-inducing cash-in's wrongfully perceived validation, with the mugging performances filling the void of any remotely believable dramatic tension. Despite all four Oscar winners, cumbersome, gleaming, brainless RED has almost nothing going for it apart from its own squandering, mockingly contemptuous wastefulness.Bruce Willis stars in this anti-brain waste of talent, which refers to his alert level, 'retired: extremely dangerous.' Clever, I guess. He's ex-CIA, black ops, who finds out bad guys want to kill him. So he musters the members of his old killing squad, and they shoot and blow things up. Actually, not so much that as firing lots of bullets in the general directions of other people, and blowing them up. The lineup features Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Brian Cox. And the black affiliate must die first, 'because that's how he would have wanted it.' So once more poor Morgan Freeman is squandered.Besides his old buddies, Bruce takes along Mary-Louise Parker, a telephone operator at the agency that manages his pension. He's fallen in love with her voice. He says she has to go on the run with him because her life is in danger. Of course. Her life will be much safer with the target of thousands of rounds of automatic weapon fire. The villains in thrillers couldn't play Duck Shot on Atari. And the good guys are only any better because the screenwriter is the god exercising deus ex machina for your viewing pleasure, not because they've endowed their characters with any brains or inner life to speak of.This celluloid vacuum isn't even close to as skillful as it acts like it is. It runs out of steam not even 15 minutes in and begins repeating itself, and the deficiency of a persuasive plot thread doesn't alleviate this syndrome. The film's over-the-topness does not excuse unanswered questions like why not a single neighbor not only looks outside or calls the police but even turns on their lights after Willis' house is completely destroyed by an entire tactical team armed with machine guns they unload various times? Why do the bad guys want our grizzled group dead? I sincerely cannot recall. Why does Mamet's beautiful and underused wife Rebecca Pidgeon, playing the zealous handler of our team's main CIA adversary, send this top agent of hers into a top-secret archive to get a highly classified report which she knows exposes absolutely nothing? If a notoriously effective CIA assassin is so inordinately good at what he does, why does he sit his kidnap victim in the back of his car with duct tape over her mouth while driving busy roads long distance? Why does Willis infiltrate a character's home to hold a family hostage and then leave without achieving anything? Why am I still sitting here even halfway through, still watching this? If a spoilsport evaluator has the nerve to spotlight that Willis is risking a stranger's life for no worthy reason and that ditzy Parker never raises a sincere protest about it, defenders will respond that an action comedy doesn't have to make sense if it's got enough, you know, action and comedy. But the action is a flaccid miscellany of slo-mo and CGI, and save for Malkovich, who's intermittently useful as a madcap LSD martyr, the comedy comprises cheesy, ineffectual backbiting rather than incisive remarks about age or espionage.I think middle-aged and older folks are supposed to enjoy this abject nonsense, because it's ceaselessly trying to manipulate us with music and contrived revelation how clever it thinks its retired characters are, and that they've 'still got it,' but the joke is on this movie because it's just as inexhaustibly stupid and utterly routine as any number of Michael Bay, John Cena or Vin Diesel vehicles those little shavers guzzle down. The only difference is that this one can't decide whether it's a farce or a retread.In one scene, Mirren is shot and a blood stain spreads on her white dress. In a closing scene not a day later, she's perfectly chipper and has had time to send the dress out to the cleaners. A story is about diligence, attention to detail, not shortcuts and the path of least resistance to all the big bangs. But what is so maddening about this movie is not its storytelling flaws and anti-intellectual cheesiness, but that the overseers at Summit and DC Entertainment know it. And every coveted master performer in its amazing cast knows it too. It's all a big flex of Hollywood's muscle, reminding us that no matter how increasingly hard it is to get a truthful human story made out there, how many personal visions are squandered and artistic visions are rejected, the bigwigs can in a time of recession take $60 million, effortlessly gather the most eye-popping jamboree of great actors we've ever seen and crap all over our faces. And make their money back. So they can do it again. And again.",1,26,52,29 October 2010
Rear Window," A Redundant But Insightful Reflection On Rear Window
","I am sitting here wondering why I am commenting on Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. It is a definitive classic of enduring interest, quality, and style. The last sentence is as redundant as this review will be. I mean, what can I say that not only hasn't already been said but isn't already known? Its masterful voyeuristic cinematography, its impeccably atmospheric sound and John Michael Hays's screen adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's short story have been quite sufficiently recognized over the past half century. I suppose there is one thing that people don't tend to think about, or at least it is one thing I haven't heard anyone say, and that is that Rear Window is a virtuoso portrait the human element of privacy, and feeling naked when we notice that it is invaded. What's more, that invasion is another element of human nature: Voyeurism.What else is left to debate for incessantly lovable Jimmy Stewart, a successful photographer whose restlessness takes him all over the world and into situations where he takes pictures no one else gets, recuperating from a broken leg during a scorching hot summer? Here is a restless daredevil who makes a living with his eyes, laid up in a wheelchair in a small, apartment. This is 1954. He's not going to sit at the computer and blast people on IMDb message boards. He does what any one of his neighbors could be found doing in his situation: Alleviating boredom by spying on the lives of his neighbors. Furthermore, his view is perfect! Through his rear window, he can see into the building across the courtyard of the complex and glimpse from front row seats the residents' daily routines. There's the ubersexy dancer who exercises in her underwear, the couple who sleep on their small balcony because they don't have air conditioning, a lonely woman who lives by herself (who alternately gains great sympathy from us and generates cruel laughs at her expense; true to the spirit of voyeurism), and a frustrated songwriter always at his piano. And, there is the salesman, a pitch-perfect Raymond Burr, who lives directly across the courtyard from Jimmy Stewart, the one with the pesky, harassing invalid wife.I can safely assume that nearly everyone who reads this generally knows the gist of the plot. It is a fine plot, ever condusive to everything Hitchcock. What is so significant about it to me is how it takes two seemingly conflicting sides of human nature and turns the suspenseful corner by dangling by a thread the inevitable, which is that an everyday person, no matter how fixed they are in their day-by-day algorithms, just may eventually discover that feeling of nakedness, of intrusion.Though there are films by Hitchcock that I favor more, like The Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, and Rope, Rear Window stands as pure cinema: Blatantly and shamelessly visual, full of layers of audible details from the ambient to deafening.",10,3,5,2 September 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," IMDb's Number FIVE?
","Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the 'final' scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again.",6,13,25,27 March 2007
Heat," Up There With GoodFellas, The Departed, The Godfather, and Scarface
","I had never realized Michael Mann was a genius before re-watching this film recently. I had seen Thief, Collateral, and Miami Vice, and though they are decent films, especially Collateral, I'd never thought of Mann as a master of his craft. When one sees Heat, they see the work of an ingenious filmmaker. The script is perhaps one of the most brilliant contemporary screenplays, because Mann as the writer is so honest with his material and characters that everything plays as naturally as one could hope for. Nothing is contrived, even the most complex symbolisms and the clearest testaments to the characters. We feel like we may have before seen the cops-and-robbers chase film wherein the hero and villain bond, and who knows? Maybe we have. Little of that matters because Heat is so well done. There is so much more to it that can be found from viewing to viewing to viewing. De Niro's stern, wary bank robber and Pacino's fixed, passionate cop feel more throughout the story than just an interest in each other. The film isn't just about the complex and wholly realistic connection that they feel. It's also about the objective statements pertaining to the audience, as we view the lives, in action and at home, of both cops and criminals, and we see how despite occupation, family life depends on what is offered by that cop or that criminal and the outcome is according to those projections.Pacino and De Niro on screen in the same frame together was certainly a big deal when this film was coming out in 1995, and who could resist that concept? An idiot, yes, but hardly anyone else. But, between fanatics of these two unmistakably wonderful contemporary actors, let's just face it: They love themselves, and they nearly always play themselves. But the positive outlook on this fact, which it is, is that they still convince us that they thoroughly understand their very complicated characters. When people say that an actor plays himself, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are actually replacing a written character with their own personality. That's a cop-out. Many of the greatest contemporary actors 'play themselves,' so to speak, and we still love them and believe them. Pacino and De Niro are two of these actors, their presence always being the same swaggering, short-fused leonine tough guy, but being such fine actors they are masters of channeling facets of their presence to convey the people they are portraying. The scene in the restaurant where they meet and talk to each other over coffee is a perfect example of two actors who play themselves yet it's so terribly hard not to understand what every nuance of their facial expressions and verbal inflections mean and how subtly they communicate.The two leads may overshadow for some fanatic filmgoers a few smaller performances. Val Kilmer, another actor with an irrepressible presence, is thrilling to watch as one of the hardened criminals in De Niro's heist crew. The opening armored car robbery shows each member of the crew in a cold, machine-like mode wherein they are nothing but armed raiders, everything else removed. The script cleverly gives them introductory scenes afterwards, and in Kilmer's, we immediately get an overall feeling of the dynamic, quick-witted, selfish, short-tempered, impatient daredevil he is whose weakness is impulse, which serves as a clever antithesis of his partner De Niro's rigidly scrupulous and organized way of living the criminal life. Also in the same scene, which is actually quite brief and not even one of the best in the film, Ashley Judd equates her side of the screen with the same density of presence and communication of character, a fiery but practical wife with convictions for her own strong, deep thoughts.I used that scene as an example to display how surreptitiously the film's writing and acting coincide to make such an effective film despite the weight of the attention given to Pacino and De Niro against such a large remaining cast. A scene that I'll mention simply to get all jumpy like an action-loving teenage guy is of course the extensive, beautifully paced, extremely intense downtown Los Angeles machine gun shootout. What a work of art! I haven't been this dazzled by an action sequence in a long long time. And if it is not one of the all-time greatest, most well-directed and exciting action sequences ever put on film, then there's no such thing as a well-directed, exciting action sequence, because, friends, this gunfight is the example any dictionary would use if defining one. Not only does it send your heart straight through your head like an exit wound from a bullet, so much happens in that scene for so many characters that the film is much intensified from that point on.And you know, the fact that by now, you've surely thought that maybe constructive criticism would do well in a review, since that's generally what reviews are for and because reviews don't sound very convincing unless they have it at some point. So, I should clarify that Heat is completely my kind of movie. It has heists, it has beautifully directed action sequences, and it stars two actors whose careers have garnered this sort of film as a staple. However, this is why one should take into consideration that my opinion is of some value when I say that Heat has a place very high in a genre that holds such classics of the past thirty or forty years as GoodFellas, The Departed, The Godfather, and Scarface.",10,1,3,15 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Movie That Ate Hollywood
","The irony of George Lucas' career is that he started out making experimental avant-garde short films and became, not always of his own volition, the closest thing the modern film industry has to an authentic classic mogul. His key problem had always been his inhibiting bashfulness when dealing with people. However, his strongest distinction has always been his shrewdness. Fans of Lucas see his sovereign autonomy as a significant countermeasure to the supreme control of Hollywood, his idealized enterprise to spend (and make) his own money on new innovations and projects that have benefited the rest of the industry as something to be commended. Dissenters, nevertheless, lose hope in what they perceive as a dominating juvenilization of the American film industry in the wake of Star Wars---the watershed that proved that Jaws and Close Encounters were no flukes but the real thing---holding Lucas and Spielberg specially accountable for the gaudy spin-off merchandise-driven summer-blockbuster mentality that has steered the business for the past three decades.I'm somewhere in the middle. More clearly, I'm guilty of ranting in favor of the dissenting argument on several occasions yet I'm aware of the validity of the former argument. I look at Star Wars now and see a film that barely holds a flame to at least a dozen or so other American films of its decade. I think what makes Star Wars, even as a stand-alone film, strike more thunder than virtually any other film in decades before or after it is its television series-scale mythological content. The fact that it was meant to be a saga spanning several films was something scarce even in a decade when Jaws 2's and French Connection II's were beginning to pop up here and there. The scope of Star Wars' story must've been as much of a shock to the system as the enormously ground-breaking FX.It's basically one of the quintessential Good Vs. Evil Sagas. It's classic in that sense. What I like about its universe is that it depicts a civilization 'a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,' suggesting that we here on Earth were likely cavemen or conquistadors when they'd already spanned an interplanetary life-sustaining geography, had technology that not only begets robotic slaves and laser dogfights in space that mix the mass of a warboat and the agility of a fighter plane, but 'weapons of mass destruction' that don't just 'nuke' entire cities or countries but whole planets. The presumably 'human' characters are able to speak languages spanning countless planets' worth of alien species. Lightsabers. Regardless, it's all on the verge of a cataclysmic struggle between a totalitarian regime and a rebel organization. The rebel organization is seemingly apt to be weaker without heroic figures who believe in an omnipresent energy that gives them purpose and power. The totalitarians, on the other hand, and more interestingly, use this omnipresent Force to motivate their evildoings. I wonder maybe if this Force is at the heart of the problem.Nevertheless, civilization has consolidated into a clear-cut case of good, wearing white, and evil, wearing black, 'May the Force be with you' and the Dark Side. As much as I love the concept of intelligent life in the universe far more advanced than us and sharing parallels, I feel like Good Vs. Evil is too archaic to be the general philosophy of everyman in a civilization that could possibly be millions of years more advanced than us. Then again, maybe that's the most significant clue: What if in a future far ahead, we're advancing technologically at the same rate as we are now, so life has expanded much further, yet we're still preoccupied with fighting over the same platitudes and ideologies as now? You can't help but quibble in your head over which religions would be the good guys and which ones would be on the Dark Side.Or maybe that's just the classical sort of tale Lucas wanted to tell. After all, his supposed influences, some I've noticed and others I guess I trust, range from Kurosawa epics to John Ford westerns, from Buddhism to abstract metaphysical theories. These aren't bad sources of inspiration, and many share, to some degree, a sense of hero worship, feelings of power directed, to whatever extent, toward fighting evil. Regardless, no other Star Wars character holds a candle to its villain, Darth Vader. Yes, Obi-Wan comes in close, but we all know what happens to him and who does it.There's still much more to say about the movie, but unfortunately it's limited by its low rank on one's priorities. Perhaps my real favorite character is the music, the immortal symphony we all know by heart. And my theory as to why the acting of Vader's generals, admirals and underlings tends to sound like a pub scene in a bad werewolf movie is because half of acting is who you're acting off of, and Vader's James Earl Jones voice is what gives him gravity, not whoever was under the actual helmet. As for the Special Edition additions, I don't know. Completely unnecessary Jabba the Hut scene, although it adds foreshadowing for Han Solo's arc. The world/creature details and CGI shots have a much different look than the comparatively realistic remaining film, making me more conscious of watching the movie than its story and immersive atmosphere. Lucas had great ideas and lots of unassuming pluck, but as the propeller of not only blockbuster but franchise mentality, sequels, prequels, reboots, remakes, revisiting the 20th-anniversary tampering, the joke's somewhat on him.",8,1,1,16 June 2010
300," The Official, Undeniable Setting of New Standards
","I have never seen such battle sequences as riveting, emotionally engulfing, as wonderful as the ones that make up three hefty quarters of 300. For example, most epics have grandiose shots of men with shields and sharp weapons, seen from this perspective as a cacophony of blemishes, clashing together and fighting to the death. In 300, we are brought face to face with the very heart of the clashing itself, everything around us rumbling to a deafening degree, every clanking of heavy steel heard as clear as crystal, and we experience the true savagery and raw, bare-faced absence of any sort of grace, knowing each character's fear as much as they are feeling it. Each battle sequence draws pure hatred from us, the audience, for the enemies, and desperate worry for the defense of the three hundred Spartan men. The film is a lush, passionate painting of historical and fantastical violence. It provokes emotion, desperation, and teenage appreciation for its extreme cool.The film sets new standards for cinematography. Seamlessly interwoven with computer- generated images, the grittiness, the chiseled, perpetually tan-gold-and-red-scorched screen is a wonder to look at. It's difficult to take your eyes away for any reason. As a lover of atmosphere in any art, being film, literature, paintings, et cetera, I found 300 to be incredibly juicy, oozing with some of the richest moods and visually emotional backdrops ever captured in a movie that I've seen. I have never seen a movie so in its own world and hypnotic to the audience, drawing us into this very unique place.Gerard Butler, the dark, magnetic actor who plays the lead role of King Leonidas in a career- making performance, is almost as dazzling to watch as the landscapes and battle sequences. This film marks an inscrutable breakthrough for him. However, it is his presence that in a way may be what draws the sporadic corniness, mostly early on, of the Spartans being directed in a way that makes them cool in that way that makes pretenders out of teenagers.It's always made me furious to see soldiers killing enemies' horses to immobilize the enemies. When the majority of the time is spent spearing men so that they fall off of their horses, it is made perfectly clear that there is not good reason to cut down a horse for the sake of immobilizing, and even having yet to kill, the rider. Also, If the Spartans' iron shields are not deterred by powerful attacks of enemy swords and spears, then how can arrows make gaping chinks in them?Overall however, 300 is unforgettable. In a time when you forget even a great film that you saw last night once you've awakened the next morning, 300, while not a great film, is that brash and immediate contradiction.",7,0,6,10 March 2007
Ran," Great Seclusively Japanese Film
","No matter how much I rave about the 1970s being the heart of change for the better for the movies and how the bar was set even higher for the production values and creative eye of cinema, it was in 1985 when Akira Kurosawa, not at all weather-beaten at age 75 with Ran, his 28th film, forcibly molded the standards of cinematic approach, which he'd already done many times through his career before that time. In Ran, he emboldens colors, ambient sound, and the reality of violence, and when the gloomy music score plays, the ambient sound disappears and the music becomes the hum of the action.The film, indeed inspired by Shakespeare's King Lear, features acting ripe with what appears to be detaching Shakespearean countenance, overacting, which to many can thus deflate the potential effect of Kurosawa's vision. However, the choice for Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays Great Lord Hidetora, and Mieko Harada, who plays the vindictive Lady Kaede, to use such old-fashioned acting techniques is not based on Shakespearean training but the influence of classical Japanese musical drama theater, exemplified in the heavy, ghost-like makeup worn by Nakadai, which resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh theater performers, along with his body language, long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. Being a very concentratedly cultural adaptation, Ran uses these dramatized aspects of the two characters to emphasize their ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures.The story itself, which is said to be a blend of King Lear and the legends of Mori Motonari, a 16th century daimyo, neither of which I have read, very tightly and carefully unravels and unfolds very present, glaring moral insights.",10,1,4,16 February 2008
The Thin Red Line," 'There ain't no other world where everything's all right. There's just this one. Just this rock.'
","The account was always that Terrence Malick's return to cinema was in some sense going to be the Pacific foil for Saving Private Ryan, the start and finish of the incidental year of WWII films. That reductive summation evaporates with the apprehension of the solitary opening string chord and the foggy grey-green image of a crocodile, descending into a swamp, slowly sinking beneath the slime. Little in our typical experience as moviegoers prepares us for this class of audio-visual dialect. The movie has a colossal cast, but if it has a 'main' character, it's Jim Caviezel's Pvt. Witt, ecstatically AWOL somewhere in a Pacific subregion. He exists in resplendent paradise, relishing the pattern of a life influenced only by naturethat's when the patrol boat recovers him.Nevertheless, upon being been reprimanded by Sean Penn's benumbed 1st Sgt. Walsh, he wafts into the film's immense ensemble, though his effort to square war's cruelty with the serene South Pacific remains at the film's heart. Sure, the movie has a narrative drive. It's about the campaign to seize Guadalcanal. Throughout the days spent conquering a hill, a swarming throng of people happen before us, some consistent, some essential for intermittent scenes or moments. Woody Harrelson's completely shocking final scene is the most heartrending of its kind, and some of the inimitable actor's most outstanding work. Despite Adrien Brody's outrage at the streamlining of his role, his eyes speak volumes. Save Witt and Walsh, the relationships given the most elucidation include the clash between Nick Nolte's Lieutenant Colonel and Elias Koteas' Captain over the extent to which either can squander lives for victory, and Ben Chaplin, who struggles to endure by grasping at recollections of his wife, but never does the action fully pledge itself to the viewpoint of a single character.It's partly this breakdown of movie storytelling that makes this blindsidingly emotional landscape of sacrifice, violence, empathy, humanity and melancholy perhaps the penultimate war film of all time, and while it's not simply, or centrally, a great war movie, it absolutely is one. It's the reason why the picture accomplishes the grand uniformity that war is believed to beget in its soldiers. Lacking one dominant figure is a distinct infrequency in war films. The film steamrolls all contrived features in which movie characters are given a pecking order. Here, the dominant figure is Charlie Company itself.Indeed, The Thin Red Line is an effort to construct a film in the figure of warfare, to make the film itself cacophonous and purely visceral, instead of to imitate reality. The creation of Malick's battle sequences have an impact of being incessantly unacquainted with where blasts, clatter and movement are emanating from, having your thoughts transited through incidental moments. It is, however, one of the most fluid films, at least purely in terms of feeling, I've ever seen, because single moments definitely resolve themselves, like one of the film's most enduring images, a butterfly fluttering past terrified, scurrying soldiers, merrily unaffected by them.One can understand the film as a portrayal of how war in humankind devastates nature, stability and the soul, but Witt's opening thoughts, and therefore the opening shot of the crocodile, seem to tell another tale, that conflict and brutality are already there, that humankind is simply an expansion of it. To that end, practically every soldier gets some occasion to ponder life, sorrow, beauty and harmony. Over each lush summit and riverbend, the movie presents unlimited uncertainties. Malick's return to filmmaking is in some ways distinct from his preceding masterworks, but in its curious meditation on the light and shadow in the human core, the part of God in our feelings and actions and the contradictions that rule our passions, Malick's film is endemic to his foregoing work. As per his pure-form custom, dialogue is regularly overwhelmed by environmental commotion, and performances and implications are elucidated by a gushing configuration of arresting visual and aural unions that elegantly fuses with John Toll's euphoric, shockingly exquisite imagery.",10,3,6,31 January 2007
Pineapple Express," Unrated Cut
","David Gordon Green, a balladist of the cinema, is the last person you'd count on to direct a Judd Apatow male-buddy comedy about two potheads who farcically spark a drug war. But he makes such an above-average stoner comedy, there's a hazard he'll be reduced to vogue in mainstream Hollywood and lured away from the high-brow human interest of All the Real Girls and Snow Angels.This definite turn by the Terence Malick-inspired filmmaker, from the same writing collaboration as Superbad, with a sizzling hot Rosie Perez in a cop suit and a die-laughing cameo by Ed Begley, Jr., has all the components you'd assume from the school in which it swims: male bonding, sophomoric though reasonably relatable sexual desires, rhetorical ribaldry, staggering drug abuse, fight scenes, gunfire, explosions. Yawn? Not this time. It's a splendid movie, first-rate of its iffy genre. In effect, it's a stoner comedy that is actually hilarious and very clever.The heroes are a process server, Seth Rogen, and his drug dealer, James Franco. Both are stoned in every single scene. Rogen has a romance going with a high school girl. I think he is still at the age of temperamental maturity where going all the way means asking a girl to be his girlfriend. Franco is even more useless, hiding in his apartment permeated with electronic gizmos and pop culture wares.Most buddy films aren't that radically distinct from romantic comedies. The relationships are generally progressed in a similar demeanor, simply with male bonding substituting erotic rapport. I think that particularly characterizes the buddies in most buddy movies produced by Judd Apatow. Consider this film's satirically mandatory ending, there's just as much hugging and reciting, 'I love you, man!' as there is high-fiving.A third chief character arrives on the stage when Dale and Saul pop in to see Saul's buddy Red played by Danny R. McBride, who has by now dimed them to an odd couple of hit men, played by the underused Kevin Corrigan and the hilarious Craig Ferguson. All of this steers, don't ask how, to a full-scale gunfight between Ted's men and a rival drug empire, only ever referred to by anybody as 'The Asians.'Two unlikely troupes have convened: the Apatow production gang, and Green and his recurrent sight-and-sound team as well as actor Danny McBride. Not shrugging off creative responsibilities on account of working within the same genre as Cheech and Chong, Harold and Kumar and Half-Baked, Green for the most part uses wide-screen set-ups with becoming aesthetic savvy. The smartly toned movie even surpasses the conventional contemporary action- comedy chase, this time involving two squad cars.This fifth feature for Green is the resolution to the question, 'What would happen if probable garbage material was made by a good director?' The result is not only a funny action- comedy, but one that is even funnier if you are or ever have been high smoking pot. The conversations, paranoia, lack of motivation, indulgence in pop culture including its obscurities, the characters' sense of humor, the ending. The film could be argued as either in support or opposition of marijuana. The answer is in the characterizations. I think if you are or have been high on it, you come out both in the mood for it and feeling guilty for being in the mood for it.",8,0,2,23 April 2009
Jackie Brown," Two of the World's Greatest Writers Join Forces
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers that will adapt a novel by a popular and well- received veteran novelist like Elmore Leonard, whose books are famous for not being adapted into very good movies, twist it into a blaxploitation homage, change the settings and a few things about the characters, and make it the best adaptation ever made of that author's work...save for Out of Sight, of course. Tarantino has that way of charmingly ruffling up other people's work and making it his own and somehow getting us to love it. Jackie Brown is wonderful.This is inarguably Quentin's least appreciated film. This is something like saying the Holy Spirit is not as appreciated as the Father and the Son, because all of his films are appreciated. They're looked at by incredible amounts of people as ingenious, groundbreaking cinema. However, Jackie Brown is not mentioned as often, it's not quoted constantly, it doesn't have a following, and it's not on IMDb's Top 250, where Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and the Kill Bills have their places. I think it deserves more recognition than it gets. l think that the reason it's his least appreciated film is frankly because it's not soaked in blood and it's a battle wits more than weapons. Even though I love blood-soaked gorefests, highlights of such a kind of film being those other four Tarantino films, I think it's awfully shallow to expect such a narrow criteria from such a brilliant filmmaker like him, leaving his other efforts in the shadows. Jackie Brown has a lot to offer: One of the finest ensemble casts I've ever seen, Tarantino's trademark salt-of-the-earth dialogue ('Beaumont ain't got a doin'- time kind of disposition...'), a roller-coaster rush of a soundtrack including forcibly head-bobbing 1970s funk with unforgettable highlights like Bobby Womack's Across 110th Street and The Brothers Johnson's Strawberry Letter #23, and a clever con game that is slowly unraveled.Jackson ignites the screen with his infectious and eternally memorable portrayal of Ordell Robie, the perfect opposite to his Jules Winnfield. He's an eccentric who doesn't realize it, a nearly laughable pseudo-badass-businessman exterior, but with a cold-hearted interior quietly ahead of everyone else, a clever double-sided mastermind.Grier naturally gives off that down-home, unsophisticated streetwise woman-trying-to- make-it feeling in the movie's title heroine, especially early on when we're just coming to know her as a character and she's not saying much, tired from nights spent in jail, just wanting a drink and a smoke and to go home, but knowing something about her situation isn't adding up. We learn to love her not just as a badass black chick in a suit with a gun, but as a middle-aged woman trying to cling to that semblance of a life she has and taking such risks to beat the odds.One surprise in Jackie Brown is the presence of Robert De Niro. It seems appropriate that Tarantino, someone who so embraces the crime genre and having done so much with Harvey Keitel, should cast De Niro as a seasoned career scumbag, the staple of his tremendous career. The surprise is that he plays the character down, which is so rare for him to do. Usually, De Niro takes a character and plays him up, making him a bigger, tougher, more brazen and bombastic character, sometimes just a little bit and sometimes a lot. Jackie Brown is a departure from the majority of his other work. His character shares a lot of the same traits as most of De Niro's other tough guys and crooks, but his disposition is so different. It makes this one of his most intriguing performances.Those who've overlooked this gem, buried in all the hype of Tarantino's other classics, you're really really missing out.",10,2,4,3 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Star Wars Film
","Empire opens with Luke Skywalker pushing back his return to base camp to investigate what he assumes is a meteor that has crashed nearby. We know that it's one of the probe droids Vader has sent to track him down. What happens on his journey to investigate? Is he confronted by Imperial Forces? Does he realize just in time? Actually he's knocked unconscious and taken captive by a horrifying Yeti-like predator to be savagely devoured. Immediately, the tone is set in stark opposition to the movie's predecessor. We're on Hoth, a planet blanketed entirely by snow and ice, routinely pummeled by countless meteorites from a neighboring asteroid belt, but the craters are fleeting as the planet is in a perpetual snow drift. The only native creatures to our knowledge are the tauntaun, camel-like creatures, and the Yeti-like ones. The latter eat the former. This is a clear indication of a film series that's going somewhere, not just playing variations on the same notes.And with confidence I say in my humble non-fanatic opinion that Empire is the best of the original trilogy. After the Buck Rodgers/Flash Gordon merriment of the original film, this one marches into mortality and sorrow, and rightly acquiesces to the latent conundrums of the story. It's because of the real drama propelled in Empire that the whole saga takes on a legendary value that hearkens back to the first and urges a continuation to the third. This is the core, not the Continuing Adventures Of. But that doesn't mean it's the most thought-provoking; it just means I buy it the most. It isn't introspectively involved or even very concerned with personalities apart from barefaced character attributes.As a result, we have the trite push-pull flirtations between Han and Leia, who begin to discover their fondness for each other during, among other things, while zooming through an asteroid field to evade Vader's goons. There is still forced, stilted dialogue aplenty, and there is also no development provided for Chewbacca, who was thrown into the first film as ornament, was never fully contemplated, and consequently was burdened with one facial expression and one bereft gargle/bark/roar. Much more could have been done. How can you be a space pilot and not be able to interact in any productive way? Does Han actually comprehend Chewy's uniform babble? Otherwise, how have they bonded? Yoda, however, is introduced with real flavor and feeling, as well as an Eastern-infused philosophical affectation. The seemingly unintentional hilarity of his voice and physicality don't seem like datedness but rather something audiences since 1980 have been too reverent or awe-struck to deride the way they do other '80s fantasy films. Who are funny are C-3P0 and R2-D2, mostly because they are essentially Woody Allen and Lassie as a comedy duo, in robotic form.But the heart of Empire is the extent of Darth Vader's ruthlessness, and his legendary obsessive struggle with Luke. Indeed, he's such a powerful and controlling presence in this film, using the Force to make lethal examples out of his own underlings as well as experimenting with putting people in chemical suspended animation freezing, that things do not go the way we'd like them to. The very bad news Luke hears, the way Han ends up paying back Jabba the Hut, the nature of Han's friendship with Lando Calrissian. There are real scenes of tension and suspense that arise out of the soap opera and mawkish comic relief. Nevertheless, the script is not only rooted in Lucas' story basis and the penning of future director Lawrence Kasdan but also one Leigh Brackett, who'd previously written some of the best Chandler adaptations as well as Rio Bravo. One can imagine the snarkiness of Han and Leia's dialogue and 3PO's hi-jinks delivering more becomingly in a film of the 1940s or '50s.Maybe since so much more deliberation and capital was concentrated on this fifth episode, the tipping point before the climax of a six-film saga, in the first place, not much was tampered with in the restored and sleek re-release. I never did recall the first film in precise detail, even when I saw this Special Edition in theaters in 1997, but now that my eye is more seasoned and conditioned, I can tell that the Cloud City was adorned with some supplementary enrichment, and there is more of that terrifying ice creature than before. I have no distrust that there are many enhancements in sound design, but I'm not a dolphin so I can't be sure.",8,0,1,22 June 2010
Sin City," We've All Seen It, We've Oo'd, We've Aah'd, But Does It Hold Its Own With The Company It's In?
","Everyone loves Sin City because not only is it an epic of blood-drenched action and sick, twisted violence and subject matter, but also filmed in black and white with specifically chosen and very richly realized colors and boasting both a cast riddled with names and faces we all love but the two directors that have delivered more on the super-cool blood-and-guts pulp entertainment level this generation than any other director. Well, as someone who has followed the careers of both directors, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, for nearly all of my life, I will say that I'm not impressed with Sin City at all. It is entertaining on the most basic level: It's sort of fun to watch when you're in a hotel and you're waiting for the other people you're with to wake up and it happens to be on TV. That's how much of an impact Sin City really has.Let's take the cinematography Rodriguez is applauded for so, with the black and white sprinkled with color placements. Steven Spielberg did the exact same thing with Schindler's List, which was filmed entirely in black and white and had a single scene wherein there was one girl in a jittering crowd of many whose dress was chosen to be pink. This meant something as well. I'm not saying that Sin City should be compared to a film like Schindler's List, because Sin City is all about style, and that's fine. Many of our greatest entertainments are only exercises in style. But Schindler's List actually filmed. Sin City was shot with a regular camera on Rodriguez's little pet blue screen and fed through a machine so the black and white with the colors can all be added later. The difference is so loud and clear I'm almost deaf. Can no one see how campy Sin City really looks? It really looks goofy sometimes. Take the image where Mickey Rourke is swimming from the duct under the river as an example. The majority of the film really does not look so cool.I understand that Rodriguez's intention was to create an exact cinematic replica of Frank Miller's original graphic novels. Well, that's fine. But why not make it a cool-looking cinematic replica? Rodriguez needs to learn to make movies like a real filmmaker makes movies. Real filmmakers know how to take risks by spending a little money, going to a real set, driving a real car, squibbing things instead of adding bullet holes later. Filmmakers are not little computer geeks having fun in their technologically converted garage in Austin, Texas. They're bold people who want to capture something intense or powerful, something personal that they imagine. Not some fluffy image anybody with that computer program could churn out. There is no talent in what he does. I am tired of him.The voice-overs delivered by the film noir caricatures that populate this movie are like the fragmented, raspy-voiced, overzealous voice-overs during movie trailers. Also, they go way too far explaining what characters are thinking. If we're watching the movie, we should be able to figure certain things out without being baby-stepped through it. It truly gets aggravating to hear Bruce Willis's voice narrating himself through getting up off the floor. Just get up off the floor. And some of these characters speak like grungy Dashiell Hammett types from New York or L.A., and some sound like Midwestern or Southern high school drop-outs with really bad grammar, and some speak in dialect that can only be found in its purest form in superhero comic books. What region is this Sin City in?! Or Basin City, as it is called in the film.Like I said, the film is very basically fun to watch. You stop over at your friend's house, and he and some other dope are watching Sin City, so you sit down and finish it with them, because that's exactly what you came over to do: Hang out. So let me tell you the good points of this film: Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen, both very natural and very becoming in their roles, and also the perfect hero-and-villain match-up. Rosario Dawson, in quite a change of pace, is the highlight of the very conveniently male-pleasing female portion of the movie. Another good touch is Josh Hartnett's performance. In fact, I think his very small role, which is given zero backstory and the slightest indications, is perhaps the most clever of the entire ensemble.Tarantino's little guest director scene is an interesting little bit but not at all distinguishable from the rest of the movie. Really, if you know the scoop, you know that Rodriguez invited Tarantino as a guest director so that he could try to prove to him that blue-screen and CGI film-making techniques are better than hands-on techniques. Notice that Tarantino did not convert.",6,2,4,23 July 2007
Saboteur," Nationalistic American Re-Tooling of The 39 Steps is Still a Non-Stop Adrenaline Rush
","I think, despite the wide speared respect and admiration for the Master of Suspense, for self-explanatory reasons, we often forget the rush his work can give us. What do we think of at the mention of his name and how good he was at creating suspense? The sudden opening of a shower curtain, a succession of close-ups with dramatic orchestral music, a spiral staircase, stuff like that, right? Let's not forget what he could do with blind man and a truckload of circus performers complete with a bearded lady, Siamese twins and a dwarf. Being so mesmerized by his later work, we can easily forget that his ability make a Speed or Duel or French Connection kind of non-stop adrenaline rush may still be unparalleled.His version of that paring-down of the thriller genre to its bare elements is not gritty by any means, or even realistic. It's actually quite silly. What are the odds of encountering the aforementioned characters in a span of a few days, especially in as big a hurry as Kane, the plane factory worker falsely accused of sabotage in a desperate scramble for his life? But Saboteur is pure escape, catching us up in movie land.In essence, it's an American reworking of The 39 Steps, which is a superior film, perhaps solely on the grounds that this 1942 retooling is somewhat deluded by its forceful injection of wartime nationalistic propaganda. Thereis virtually nonstop talk of how Americans have backbone that will always make them the victors against scum like Otto Kruger, Norman Lloyd and Alan Baxter, who are particularly excellent as three smart, stylish and menacing men Kane must overcome. But altogether, The Master very seldom allows the pounding engine of his plot to in effect stop in its tracks for a soapbox diatribe, and is more often apt to work the propaganda Americana into situations wherein it works sardonically, such as when the circus act decides whether or not to alert the authorities to Kane by putting it to a vote and antagonizing the snarling dwarf who still protests despite the will of the majority. Fritz Lang submitted to WWII propaganda with his very clever Man Hunt, and like though perhaps more so than that 1941 actioner, Saboteur is a relentlessly thrilling picture that runs the risk of taking a modern audience out of the world of the story with blatant jingoistic contrivance, but maybe that is in itself a plus for modern-day movie buffs like myself, who as screen junkies are hyper-aware of the dangers of propaganda but simultaneously are fascinated by its nostalgic effect, that which causes our imaginations to enhance the feeling of escape with the fantasy of being in the old movie house with the cheering, guileless crowd, the celluloid whirring and flickering overhead and projecting magic on that screen.Indeed, one can imagine the enormous rush of excitement seeing this film at the time of its release, being engulfed by The Master's virtuosic technique like a roller-coaster ride, and what it must've been like at the onset of his American career and how it must've taken cinemas by storm. Although not one of the great film craftsman from Leytonstone's more charismatic leading men, Cummings is capable as the likable Kane. Lane is also good as the stronger-than-usual Hitchcock leading lady. But let's be honest, how much do performances matter in his films? A champion of the Russian montage, even when we're not enthralled by the performance itself as we are by Perkins in Psycho and Stewart or Day in The Man Who Knew Too Much, it's the craftsmanship of the editing and the rhythm that create the illusion of emoting in the faces of his actors. Such is the self-assured skill at work in a film like Saboteur.",9,1,2,30 December 2010
Gangs of New York," Personal Vs. Political
","Though Scorsese had cogitated this project for decades, it still serves well as a companion piece to his adaptation of The Age of Innocence. Set in 1870s NYC, that story depicts the ivory tower built upon the urchins of the city's mean streets up into the 1860s, depicted here. I find the extreme class divides between both stories fascinating. Was Day-Lewis' Newland Archer studying law and enjoying the opera on the Upper East Side at the same time his Bill the Butcher was leading slaughters in Lower Manhattan? Standing alone, nonetheless, Gangs is about the classic revenge struggle of DiCaprio's angry young hero Amsterdam.This is Amsterdam's fever dream of recollections and impressions of the history of Five Points. Mention of saints, Satan cast out of paradise and a large, championed crucifix, all in a row not even two minutes in, shortly followed by a battalion of reactionaries receiving Holy Communion before a vicious street fight, signals Scorsese's way through the character's agitated story, some of it, Amsterdam tells us, he remembers, the rest of which he took from dreams. So, he's very much of his time, place and circumstances, living them both inside and out. This gives Gangs the vehement storytelling energy of Scorsese's more modern films centered on gangsters, rather than, say, the abstract contemplativeness of his earlier Kundun, also about a crusader whose early childhood is saturated in deep religious zeal. And perhaps there's a religious lapse personal to Scorsese when Amsterdam becomes a man, setting forth on his vendetta as he pitches the Bible into the river, in very smooth high-definition slow-motion.What's also immediately evident is the full-bodied cacophony of urban life, squashed in on itself, doing little to comfort traditionalists and xenophobes, not the least stubborn of which is Day-Lewis' Irish-hating Bill, a killer WASP let's say, introduced scraping his foot against the ground like a literal bull, whom we later learn is perhaps the most eloquent man ever to have trouble reading. NYC here is its own character, arguably in a similar way that Vietnam is the main character of Apocalypse Now, in that it ceaselessly inundates the characters on their epic journey. Amsterdam and Bill are at personal odds framed by their dynamically different class and generational positions in a society fueled by racism and other forms of bigotry, fed by ubiquitous corruption. The illustration of the hounding and intolerance of non-Natives at the time is one of the historical elements to which the film remains most faithful. Even beyond the barbaric makeshift melees that bookend this saga, violence is the fabric of this main character, and Scorsese creates an all-encompassing textile of sudden explosions of it, from fleeting cutaways of random muggings to a brutal fistfight between Amsterdam and McGloin carefully storyboarded for gracefully headlong, vicious energy, followed with fluent transition into a contemplative comedown of Amsterdam's uncertain sentiment toward the newly admiring Butcher.True to America's lineage, Scorsese depicts a world where property holds sway over humanity. 'I'll give you a dollar for that locket,' Bill bids a fellow, who tells him it was his mother's. 'Dollar and a half,' Bill wrangles. 'Done.' A man of wealth, likely one of Newland Archer's peers, bids, 'You can always hire half the poor to kill the other half.' Anybody can be bought, and in order to secure your rights and have them protected you must secure and protect them all by yourself. The film's tapestry shows how free-for-all capitalism and weak government had made criminals out of everyone, having generated America's immense gangland history. Let's point out that Amsterdam and his compadres rob a poor woman's house while it's burning down. They're hungry! He later leads his posse in pawning a dead body off as loot. Bill swiftly lets him know that the mere pleasure of his company has a price. We see he means it when he puts on the most masterfully commanding charm and deferential charisma when confronted with a wealthy family whose interests are carefully considered by powers that be.The film's sporadic glimpse into the antiquated tradecraft of thieves and gangland M.O. is given the grinning sense of nifty fun of The Great Train Robbery's Victorian-era safecracking or Paper Moon's Dustbowl short cons. Cameron Diaz shows her bones as the wickedly clever sneak thief who becomes Vicky to Amsterdam's LaMotta, or maybe more akin to Zoe Bethune to Amsterdam's J.R. Unfortunately, this romantic trajectory also sends the plot for a time into hackneyed territory, something Scorsese had avoided more effectively than any other Hollywood director of his generation, or most. Gangs, thus, does lose the infectious forcefulness and unceasing originality of any of his other crime-themed films. Karen Hill had three dimensions. Diaz's Jenny is increasingly diluted into one, merely a tag-along love interest. It's the class struggle that gets the propellers spinning again, as the immigrants engage their oppressors with Democratic leadership. And when subjugation and violence again overtake, the film comes full circle to the epic street fight for justice, both for the hero and for America itself.",8,0,0,25 October 2011
Moon," Sam Rockwell is the Entire Film, Which is Really the Biggest Plus.
","Is Moon, the first film by Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, recalling 2001, or does its excavating station on the far side of the moon just happen to date back to the 2001 epoch, which was indeed eight years ago? I'm prone to the second theory. After the mission carrying Dave Bowman vanished beyond Jupiter, the human race decided to concentrate on the moon, where we were already, you will remember, directing activities. In Moon, the inside architecture of the new lunar station was inspired by the 2001 ship, and the station itself is supervised by Gerty, more of a companionable version of HAL 9000 that elusively bolts around.One can't peg the story's period, but this station on the far side is geared by a single crew member, Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell. He is the entire film, which is really the biggest plus. As an actor with such pure and natural presence, he has been criminally underused, and now we are trapped with him all alone with absolutely no one else around, and he must carry the film all by himself, much to our delight. He's working out the final days of a three-year contract and is near breakdown from isolation. Talking to loved ones via video link doesn't do the trick. The predominantly computer-programmed station traverses lunar rock to extract Helium-3, processed to supply Earth with pollution-free power.I want to take a step back and consider some latent issues in the film. In an era when our space and distance barriers are being pushed way outside the human comfort zone, how do we cope with the trials of space in real time? In reduced gravity, how do our bodies handle the diminishing of bone and muscle mass? How do our minds deal with such seemingly infinite cycles of seclusion? The 2001 ship dealt with the corporal trials of its centrifuge. Dave and Frank had each other and HAL. Sam is all on his own, save for Gerty, whose voice by Kevin Spacey proposes he was programmed by the same voice synthesizers used for HAL. Gerty seems sound and affable, but you never know with these cybernated things. All Sam knows is that he's past his best before date, and about to be reprocessed back to Earth. Space is a bleak and desolate hole without mercy or care. Sam has no reliefs at all. Who would enlist for this assignment? What kind of a corporation would ask him to? We, and he, eventually catch on.",8,4,6,24 September 2009
True Romance," This Movie's Nuts
","Revisiting Tony Scott's True Romance for the first time since somewhere in the throes of high school, I find that, as a lifelong Tarantino admirer, everything that tends to annoy me about Tarantino is more evident here than in any of the films he directed himself. And yet what is also evident is what shocked critics and audiences about Tarantino's work that jumpstarted the new generation of movies. There is an unhinged, guileless relatability to his material. Everything he writes is so rich and ripe. True Romance, nevertheless, implodes on itself. It is so inundated with homage, references and explosively gruesome set pieces that it seems to obliviously waltz right past countless opportunities for real drama so that it can continue on its path of totally, completely external and over-the-top narrative clockwork.You see, when I was 12, I could invest myself in Clarence and Alabama's romance, because I felt like a Clarence, just like a lot of 12-year-old boys who watch a lot of movies. So that's how I fantasized that it would be one day, that we suddenly happen upon the perfect beautiful buxom blonde hooker who likes whatever we like, and worships us from then on. I'm 21 now. Perhaps the least interesting thing to me now is the eponymous romance. Like the relationship between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon in director Tony Scott's first film The Hunger, the dimension to Clarence and Alabama's is too entrenched in male fantasy to be completely convincing. And let's not get so carried away with these theories about Clarence picking up where Travis Bickle left off. It's not exactly a ridiculous or even invalid theory, but let's look at what Clarence really is, which is why so many guys respond to this movie: He is in some way how we see ourselves when we are preteens and (successfully) acts upon all of the sexual or violent or adventurous fantasies that obsess him and derive from an overwhelming intake of popular culture.This is clearly exemplified when Clarence goes to kill his new wife's pimp, specifically acknowledging that he is haunted by the fact that he's breathing the same air as him and getting away with it every day, that he doesn't deserve to live. Revenge and retribution take the thematic cake in the QT canon. In each Tarantino script, something goes awry in the life of some cruel, brutal and violent men due to the intentional actions, or farcical negligence, of other people. Brutal and violent behavior ensues, and yet there are glimpses of compassion and morality among the tough, cruel and depraved people that populate them, according to their own self-conscious universe. True Romance is the epitome.The best thing about the movie by far is its renegade structure of reserving entire self-contained scenes for characters who we haven't seen before and won't see much after, interacting with another character who's been introduced already and probably won't live to see his third scene. The pinnacle of the effectiveness of Tarantino's free-wheeling narrative feature is the much-discussed scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. In eight pages of dialogue, Walken delivers every line so coolly, with Hopper not much with which to answer except 'What are you talking' about?' and 'I don't believe you.' But Walken creepily alternates between cruelty and empathy. Then when he slides in for the knockout, it turns out to be a cool, jaw-dropping rope-a-dope. The two veterans' attentiveness is unreserved, their performances candid, so they just lean back and Scott's camera catches them every time, never letting them fall.Overall though, it's ultimately all dressed up with nowhere to go, only really indicating how it's supposed to be read through intertextual links with other films. Each character and plot strand is either transplanted from vintage plot formulas, specific films, or classic character and scene stereotypes. Characters don't relate to the world in any manner except through celebrity idols, movies, music or character embodiments emerging straight from those very worlds. Natural Born Killers achieved a traumatic degree of satire with such material, but True Romance takes itself very seriously, indulging it exactly what Stone held up to horrifying censure, much to its writer's odd chagrin. It's a soap opera hiding in the Heroic Bloodshed genre wrapped in a Badlands homage with exploitation dressing.Tony Scott, the ultimate post-MTV filmmaker, has always worked exclusively in the commercial American industry. His films have always been unabashed business and mostly within the action/thriller genres. He's certainly not as mercenary as Michael Bay, and his choice of projects is more interesting. Regardless, he places emphasis on slick, high-concept narratives while drawing heavily from the diffused, neon-tinged visual style of music videos and commercials, complete with rapid-fire editing and prominent rock soundtracks. True Romance is no exception, and he retains his own familiar quick cuts, colored filters and swanky production design while achieving the allusive pop culture awareness of its writer's own directorial work. It's a big, fat pop culture chocolate cake. And just like regular chocolate cake, the older we get, the more we start to appreciate treats of nutritional value.",9,0,1,13 October 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Bollywood Dickens
","Like 2007's Juno, Slumdog Millionaire is essentially a feel-good film by a good director that is given much more credit than is due. Juno was cute like an emasculated Wes Anderson film. Slumdog is like modern live-action Disney film in spite of its violence, which hardly rivals what Disney films have been doing recently. This fictional biography is based entirely upon deus ex machina. It is concerned with building a harmonious world founded on the marble floors of dreamy ideologies and sated with a pleasant, immediately gratifying style.Danny Boyle's $15 million Hindi fairy tale radiates with the feeling of a call to action. This is a breathlessly paced film, moving all around the emotional map, about a Mumbai orphan who emerges from the slums on the might of his sparkling ability to retain minutiae. The story's shy, pure and heroic protagonist reaches remarkable, vindicating heights merely with the mental and social experience of being a slumdog. He is a beacon of idealism for the hopeful masses. What I admire objectively is that this hyperkinetic melodrama's general allure will acquaint millions of moviegoers with the real India for the first time.We react to the tragedy of the India of social classes that appear as if to be estranged by dimensions. A woman crawls from a cardboard box. Men bathe at a fire hydrant. People excrete waste on the sidewalk. On the other hand, the world's largest middle class, mostly lower-middle, but all the more highly regarded. Millionaires. Mercedes-Benzes and Audis. Luxury condos. Education is bursting at the seams. A thriving computer section. A cascade of doctors and neurosurgeons.Complete with a musical sequence at the end, but also an early scene of electric shock torture, Boyle's rags-to-riches tale balances these two Indias by cutting between a hell of destitution and predation and the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. It tells the story of an orphan from the slums of Mumbai who is born into a brutal existence. A petty thief, impostor and survivor, mired in dire poverty, he improvises his way up through the world and remembers everything he has learned. He finds a small place in the Mumbai gangland, and even falls in idealized love with a girl who keeps eluding him.Sort of an Indian City of God, the film's flashback storytelling follows his life until his appearance as the show contestant. At the point in his life where he is a contestant on the show, the film takes on a Bollywood-laced magical prestige. Proposed as a 'slumdog,' he gives the correct answer to question after question and becomes a nationalized idol to audiences who are watching the show live. The flashbacks show the experiences through which he happened to pick up the observations that are now winning him millions of dollars. He doesn't volunteer this astonishing information. The film opens as it's beaten out of him by the show's sweaty, violent security staff. They are convinced he must have stolen the answers.This crowd-pleaser, scripted with a brisk pace by Simon Beaufoy, uses attention-grabbing cinematography by Boyle's regular DP Anthony Dod Mantle, Chris Dickens's machine-gun- speed editing, and Boyle's trademark energized, driving, uber-modern soundtrack. One could expect from that description a gimmicky film directed by an insecure show-off. But Danny Boyle is one director whose films are made in that style and yet, like a more diplomatic Spike Lee, our abstract familiarity with delight and social ecstasy are stimulated by his work, even by his lesser films such as The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary. Slumdog Millionaire has no underpinnings beneath the marble floors of dreamy ideologies and immediately gratifying style, but I can't deny that it does have that Danny Boyle touch.",7,0,4,7 January 2009
Contact," A Life-Affirming Epic Imagining Universal Concerns We All Have
","Contact is a $90 million outer space film made by Hollywood with major stars from the director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back to the Future trilogy, and yet has a profound effect that no viewer can escape, a universal concern that we all have. Is it not probable that intelligent life exists somewhere else in the universe? And, what would have to happen for people to reject belief in a god?There is a fascinating point at which the story becomes ambiguous. After two hours of watching Jodie Foster's earnest, ambitious and brilliant heroine fight to discover life beyond earth, she has an experience that cannot be explained with full certainty, neither by the filmmakers or the audience, yet it affirms our life and our existence, that even if we ever make contact with alien life, we may only find that sharing existence with them is all that makes it feel significant. The film is a spectacle, yes, but there is so much surrounding that spectacle, the explosions, whorls of light, and tragic and infuriating midpoint of the story. It is a narrative expression, and incidental elegy, of Carl Sagan's work and ideas, urging human beings to realize that we are not core essence of existence, that we are an infinitesimal fraction. It is a deeply upsetting thought to many people, but it only makes our millions of years of survival and persistence unthinkable and dear.Robert Zemeckis's often under-appreciated philosophical epic clearly pivots the question of whether intelligent life exists on other planets, but it also explores how belief is proved. And regardless of the build-up to its cataclysmal climax, it doggedly hinges upon that theme. Foster and the character of Matthew McConaughey's function as counterpoints to each other, seeming at first to be a token subplot concerning badly gratuitous love interests, but their relationship develops far, far beyond that. They are an important dynamic that balances her striving for palpable evidence and unrelenting intellectualizing with his dogmatic point of view through faith and personal feelings. The movie is honest and loyal to what is historically proved to be realistic in its view of religion and science clashing constantly throughout the story, with some surprisingly rough consequences.Foster's methodical crusade is lonely, just like we are all alone. She just happens to be more in touch with this formidable feeling. Her boss, a corporate attention whore played by Tom Skerritt, tells her the field of search for extraterrestrial life is professional suicide. But that's the only reason she's in this profession. She's made fun of, but her consumption sits complicated with personal obsessions. With her father, played with very real vibes by David Morse, she shared the enthusiasm of picking up obscure station signals on their amateur radio apparatus. He died while she was still young, and she became unflappable that by some means, sooner or later, she could contact him. This belief is at issue with the certitude that she does not believe in God or the paranormal. Her search for extraterrestrial life is her interpretation of that childhood right. Contemplating the infinity and inscrutability of the universe, you're inclined to clarify it with a supposition like God, but one doubts that a God isn't a redaction that fosters our self-worth in the face of something around which we cannot get our mind.Movies like Contact clarify why most sci-fi blockbusters and other humanistically solipsistic space films relinquish me with dry and unfulfilled feelings. When I look up at the sky at night, when I see footage of the arrival of the research vehicles on Mars or the moon, when I read about astronomy and its variants that deal with its overall configuration and evolution, I graze a mental phoenix. Space and time are so immeasurable in all respects, and our existence is so momentary, that all we know is like one infinitesimal clue in an unimaginably colossal black, well, space. Has another life-sustaining world existed and determined more? We've only been listening for roughly forty years. A beacon's probability of getting to us at the fitting time are so far flung. Can one really allow their preexisting faiths obstruct them from the natural curiosity and inconceivable astonishment?Zemeckis fills his movie with formulaically defined but nonetheless interesting characters, played by particularly good actors. There is John Hurt's enigmatic billionaire who spends his life in the skies within his jet, landing only sparingly. He follows Foster's search and beckons his own boundless assets. And there are two presidential advisers, James Woods and Angela Bassett, who, in the ritual of American alien movies, see the signals as a likely menace to earth. But the film's honest depiction of the world's most influential ideologies in the chasm of its own, their consideration of an alien threat seems more of a real-life likelihood than that of Hollywood.",9,4,9,16 February 2009
Donnie Darko," Director's Cut
","Richard Kelly wrote and directed this opulent modern vision. It comes straight from his own mind and heart, and it doesn't stop coming until it can only be called his. When such a collaborative thing like a movie can converge as predominantly the ideas of an only fraction of the amount of people who contribute to a film's making, whether or not it is great, you have seen the work of a powerful filmmaker. It is definitively original. Even if it were not so inventive a story, Donnie Darko would still be original because it can most certainly be said to have originated from its maker.It only makes sense for Kelly's story to revolve around a Nietzschean superman in the most close-to-home and identifiable way. A swarthy Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubled teen and unassuming madman. Or a superhero. Of course not in the customary mold but nevertheless an individual who makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the world within the view of more recent generations as he shakes the algorithmic fabric of everyday life in his reactions of disgust and vitriol to the hypocrisy of the status quo of his environment.In its refiguring use of time and its uniquely transcendent effect on a single central character, it is deeply reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. But really, there are different ways to read the fundamental interpretation of the film, though there are many. Kelly is deliberate, though not exactly subtle, in his use of hints through references to Graham Greene's The Destroyers and Richard Adams' Watership Down, the latter apparently new to the Director's Cut. The direct presentation of passages from The Philosophy of Time Travel book give us intermissions to decode the sometimes oddball occurrences in the plot without allowing them approval to go to the extreme and hammer us with infodumps.But while the speculatively supernatural facets reveal a ambitiously vivid imagination, Donnie Darko affords a parallel in its savvy depiction of the real world, the key to which is how the most motivated forces of Donnie's life propel him towards the references I previously mentioned. Kelly portrays what it feels like to be in high school, no matter where you are. In encapsulating the confusion and suffering of high school, he provides observations what could lead young people to acts of violence against their peers. Aside from the right-wing religious dingbats who rail against Donnie's own personal belief system, not to mention those of the tired and repressed characters around him, Kelly shows the casual cruelty of other kids, the posses, the kids who don't fit in, the snail pace and the occasional inspired points in time.Gyllenhaal makes Donnie the ultimate onslaught to adults: Brilliant and inquisitive. Gyllenhaal's performance is acidic, sensitive and beneath it all, crushingly sweet. Kelly familiarly relates Donnie's family life. The scenes between Donnie and his sisters, one of them played by Jake's real life sister Maggie, scream their acquaintances with our own observations throughout life. The parents are truly caring but are often at a loss for how to handle their son. The first scene of dialogue is a cleverly subjective way of looking into a fiscally conservative household who doesn't realize how socially liberal they are. One scene, supposedly newly restored to the Director's Cut, with the father who condemns most people for being full of ...it and commends his son for being a challenge to them, is welcome and reveals another dimension to the older character. And alternative dimension is definitely a prevalent theme.The film ponders the perfect modern query: What if the universe as we know it, not just as we respectively conceptualize it, indeed isn't as we logically perceive it? In making the everyday as complicated as the cosmic, Donnie Darko has the fortitude to endures as a koan to many even in its sensed audience. Kelly headlong facilitates uncensored expression of the universal conscious with broad parody and satire with purposeful psychodrama and reveals action and events no one could foresee but him.",9,1,3,31 March 2009
The Social Network," Not Only a Spike on the 2010 Radar but a Refreshing Return to Razor-Sharp Filmmaking Precision
","We get the film version of every best seller, graphic novel, comic book series, war and topical phenomenon within reach. And too frequently, they're assessed on the strength of how committed they are to the source. Numerous critics haven't liked The Social Network because it doesn't follow the facts. The Guardian pondered whether a 26-year-old entrepreneur truly ought to have his name muddied in a foggy fact/fiction jumble for the movie-going public's common entertainment. Zuckerberg himself, the film's core subject and fascinating protagonist, said at a conference he really wished that nobody had made a movie about him, at least while he was alive.I fully understand and sympathize with these points. Part of me feels it's unfair to not only fictionalize but hold up to public censure the short life of a twentysomething. But this is a useless attitude toward evaluating movies. What counts is whether a movie is high-quality and gratifying, not whether it's true to a novel, play, real-life figure. To be sure, countless films are magnificent for the reason that they interpret their initial sources into cinema vernacular. Gangs of New York's factually inaccurate, sure, but it's profoundly true to the import and reality of its depicted era and way of life. Hitchcock was painstakingly lucid with facts in The Wrong Man but at the expense of the spirit and power of its characters.Fincher's known for dark, meticulous dramas that tap into contemporary society's anxieties and obsessions. This one dashes through two hours of magnetic dialogue. It makes an ironically incommunicable account lucid, captivating. Many might understandably think it hopeless to make a movie about a computer programmer, as programming's just writing in a language nobody in the audience understands. Still Fincher and Sorkin dramatize the Facebook phenomenon in language that carries the import of the social media revolution with the same degree of vibrance and wit that Network did.To conjure up Facebook, Zuckerberg needed to be familiar with next to zilch about relationships or human nature, and this film's version of him isn't. What he needed was the capacity to perceive a way to engage the human race in the small world phenomenon. I maybe know 50 of my Facebook friends well, 100 I added just for going to the same high school at the same time, another 100 friends of friends. I can't recall the last time I received a Request from anyone with whom I didn't share at least one 'Mutual Friend.' The film begins with a date between Zuckerberg and Erica. He anxiously nurses a beer and speed-talks through an uncompromising cross-examination, almost vicious one-upmanship. Erica breaks it off, reprimands him, leaves. Erica (a storybound character) is correct, but at that instant she puts Zuckerberg in business. He goes home, begins hacking into the 'facebooks' of Harvard dorms to accumulate campus girls' head shots. He programs a page where they can be ranked for their attractiveness. Chauvinistic and criminal, this proves so trendy, it crashes the campus servers. After it's harvested by a humdrum website called 'The Harvard Connection,' Zuckerberg propagates it into Facebook.Programming vernacular and methods are broadly recognized, but it's he who discerns how he can associate them with a networking site. Facebook's brilliance entails not mental keenness but its scheme of mingling self-image with social interface. Zuckerberg longs to hit back at all the Harvard prudes he wishes would like him, so he absorbs them in a surrounding substance that's even now on the rise. This is the very reason why I feel The Social Network deserves the Oscar win for Best Editing. It has an associational effect of overtonally aggregating the nature of time, various rhythms to energize the pace and intellectual shot-by-shot links to create an emotional version of the narrative rather than a plodding entrepreneurial dossier.The depositions' testimony makes it clear there's a case to be made against Zuckerberg, many of them sins of omission. It's left to the final crawl to explain how they turned out. The point is to show an interaction of undergraduate chaos, enormous amounts of money and manic energy. Zuckerberg may have had the acument that produced Facebook, but he didn't do it single-handedly, and the movie gets a recounting by cutting between various lawsuit depositions. We gain understanding of the Harvard social structure, a campus where skill enlists affluence and relations as achievement factors. We meet the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer), moneyed hunks who suppose Zuckerberg stole their idea. We meet Eduardo Saverin, played by a warmly relatable Andrew Garfield, Zuckerberg's closest (sole) friend, who was made CFO, lent the enterprise the money that it required to commence and was driven away. Most remarkably we meet Sean Parker, the founder of two renowned, momentous startups.It's the capricious Parker, fresh out of work but stretched out in celebrity and past triumph, who seemed to be the only person to make Zuckerberg blink, much less haul him into the big time. He rationalized why Facebook needed to move to Silicon Valley. Why more money would come from venture capitalists than Eduardo would ever boost with his humble calls to flush New Yorkers.The dialogue has the pace, spontaneity of Paddy Chayefsky or a Howard Hawks film. Eisenberg, who's concentrated on playing feeble or fastidious, is an infrared homing beacon hunting his own goals. Timberlake stunningly triumphs with the cunning task of playing Parker as both a strutting show-off and someone who takes on Zuckerberg as an academic match. We could see them as symbolic of the relationship between the real-life story and this film.",8,1,2,4 November 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Interesting: A Feel-Good Movie About How Effort Pays Off, But Happiness Is Something We Never Truly Acquire
","The Pursuit of Happiness is a film that finds suspense and drama in the smaller things in life, and instead of inflating the drama of a more action-packed or special-effects-driven story places us in the shattering turmoil of an everyman's hard knock life. This is my favorite thing about the movie. We are engrossed in the action that takes place in the frantic day-to-day struggle for a man to simply be happy, which in the context of the movie is to be financially comfortable with a roof over his son's and his own head.The film is a vehicle for Will Smith, not to mention his cute and smart young son whom co- stars, and it's likely a demonstration of his range. During his career, he's grown as an actor. In his earliest movies, he was very stiff, very scripted, and now he is very graceful and very becoming in his roles, and The Pursuit of Happiness is a show of the extent to which his talent reaches.It's a very well-written and well-directed film, very light but also very tight and emotionally involving, and it's quite refreshing. The only inconsistency is perhaps the almost unreal and hurried finale, but a flaw that can be easily overlooked, as it provokes the audience heavily and doesn't come without grace. The film is an uplifting holiday season return of the great feel-good film.",7,1,1,2 January 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Repetition Helps, but It's Not the Key.
","The opening sequence of this third Indiana Jones picture is the one part that really feels fresh, or rather, it recovers 1940s serial and magazine imagery that Spielberg hadn't used yet. The remainder of the film doesn't come as a revelation to Indy fans, but then how could it? The series by then had characterized a household universe of hazardous stunts, breathtaking chases, wry humor and the pursuit of ludicrous objects in extraordinary places.Raiders and Temple of Doom delineate the modern stamina for action-adventure films. They were a feverish revolution. But there was no way for Spielberg to outdo himself, and maybe it was for the best that Last Crusade was indeed supposed to be Indy's final film, and should've been. It will be heartbreaking watching the rejuvenated series age and tire out. Even in this third escapade, some of the basics are second-hand from Raiders. This time, Indy's mission is to locate the Holy Grail, which calls to mind the first movie's Ark of the Covenant, and both instances are race against Nazi villains.The new-fangled component this time is how Spielberg enhances some of Indy's backstory. We discover his real name and meet his father, Professor Henry Jones, played by Sean Connery at just the right pitch. Like the fathers of typical boys' stories, Dr. Jones is not a parent so much as a full-grown partner, an older chum who lacks full-bodied characterization because kids can't see their parents as intricate human beings. Perhaps we conjure up the Hardy Boys' father, who rolled his eyes and grinned at the activities of his endearing youngsters and maybe sporadically 'worried' or 'advised them firmly.' Because the Hardy Boys were always mixed up, at a green age, with a never-ending slew of fraudsters, hijackers, Nazi agents and robbers, their father's impassiveness was either transcendental or insane, and Connery enjoys himself with some of the same essentials.What Ford does looks so simple, so dry, that few other stars could keep such a square and poker-faced poise amid such pandemonium. After young Indy learns his life's mission in the early high point, the predominant plot is set after Raiders, when Henry Jones, the world's foremost Grail connoisseur, is snatched by bandits who are certain he knows where it's now hidden. He does. And Indy, working from Dad's notebook, trails from the States to the waterlogged burial chambers under Venice, and then to the barren regions of the Holy Land, where there is a fun chase including a formidable Nazi armored tank. He's escorted on his expedition by Dr. Elsa Schneider, an art historian he meets in Venice, but the character is a letdown after the fervor of Karen Allen in Raiders, and even the light-heartedness of Kate Capshaw's presence in Temple of Doom.As had been established as custom with those first two films, Spielberg sets up various set pieces of sophisticated workmanship. The art direction is terrific in a getaway from a zeppelin by airplane. If there's a tinge of disenchantment in this movie, it's because Spielberg simply couldn't reproduce the shock of endless inventiveness and dizzying energy. Raiders and Temple of Doom were a crossroads in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was no way Spielberg could make it crisp and fresh yet again.",9,2,3,28 October 2011
Goodfellas," This Movie Is A Drug.
","In the opening moments of GoodFellas, a movie about the tradecraft and culture of organized crime in New York, our storyteller Henry Hill says that for as long as he can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster, that it was better than being President. That he voice-overs his own life, later joined by his wife, narrating her side, is pivotal to the movie's ingenuity. Though the film refuses to judge its characters, it's not an omniscient portrayal, but a frame of reference rooted in yearning for the life. What's more, alternating dual narration causes us to see scenes in different ways. 'These were blue-collar guys,' Hill's wife rationalizes. 'The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut a few corners.' Their influence was, and is, exhilarating. 'If we wanted something, we just took it,' Henry says. 'If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again.' After all of his harrowing experiences, Henry, played by Ray Liotta in the stand-out performance of his career, still carps, still misses all the good times. And after literally having seen this film possibly a hundred or more times, I still watch.The screenplay is both based on Nicholas Pileggi's biography of Hill, and Scorsese's own Little Italy recollections. The early scenes showcase adolescent Henry as an errand boy for the local Brooklyn mob. A shot of him peering out his tenement window reflects Scorsese's own schoolday reminiscences of the neighborhood. So does the reverse-shot which utilizes quiet slow-motion for closeups of mobsters' shiny shoes, slick ties, greased-back hair, ostentatious rings, smoldering cigars. In a movie legendary for violence that happens by surprise, one of the most jolting kicks comes when Henry's beaten by his father for missing school. He had to 'take a few beatings' at home owing to his teenage professional pursuit, but it was a small price. Violence is like the tempo beneath every scene. The percussion is the fruits of unwarranted benefits. Henry's accomplice Jimmy Conway emerges into his first shot with Robert De Niro's special brand of broadcasted constraint. His mannerisms say, 'Don't worry. You'll all get autographs if you're patient.' Henry's other partner is the unforgettable Tommy DeVito, in an extraordinary performance by Joe Pesci, who oversteps his influence rather than letting it imply itself.Henry's enthusiasm for his developing profession is tangible. In the movie's most talked-about shot, he takes his future wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco gives it her all) to the Copacabana. There's a line in front, but he squires her across the street, downstairs through service hallways, the kitchen area, out into the showroom right as their table's being set right in front of the stage. This uninterrupted three-minute shot is not just a cameraman's feat: It's a bold technique showing how the whole world appears to unravel readily before young Henry Hill. There's another particularly extended shot, as Henry acquaints us with his fellow gangsters. Henry leads the camera through a packed speakeasy, calling out names as the characters nod to the camera, mutter to Henry. The camera appears to track Henry, yet appears to be his POV; sometimes he's talking to them, sometimes to us. We're included in the scene. The cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, was a central accomplice. Cultivating Scorsese's trademark form, he quite rarely lets his camera be stationary. It's so often in motion, if just slightly, making us not cold bystanders but complicit witnesses.Alongside the violence is an account of capitalistic striving. Henry and Karen come from circumstances that couldn't freely result in Cadillacs, Vegas excursions, fur coats. She rationalizes what he has to do to finance their prestige. The movie centralizes Henry's climb through the mob, then down into prison sentences and full-blown duplicity. Initially the mob looks to be an augmentation of his life, then eventually, after he begins selling drugs, there's a hemmed-in diminishing. The camera style in the earlier scenes ritualizes his network of control with all-encompassing grace. Near the end, in an intoxicatingly berserk segment huddled in one day, the form gets hectic and jerky as he hustles frenziedly around the neighborhood on family and criminal errands while a helicopter constantly feels like it's fluttering above. This is one of the most virtuoso film sequences I have ever seen.What Scorsese does that makes GoodFellas so universally adored is infect us with his exhilaration with the material. It has the breakneck propulsion of a storyteller who can't wait to see your reaction. Scorsese's camera embraces these guys, listens to their shoes clicking, beholds the tailoring of their clothes. And when they're plotting the fabled Lufthansa job, he has them whispering together in a tight three-shot that has their heads bent low and close with the rush of their own awesomeness. What a rush it is for them to steal.The film's way is to sever dialogue with brutality. We see some of cinema's most effective cries wolf, as in Pesci's legendary restaurant scene where Tommy would like to know what Henry meant when he said he was a funny guy. Other instants amplify abruptly out of the sheer mob environment: The way a mistaken drink order leads to blood. The way kidding around in a bar leads to a man being viciously brutalized. The way the violence bayonets the everyday lives of the characters is invariably enforced. Tommy, Henry and Jimmy, with a body in their trunk, stop at Tommy's mother's house to get a knife, and she insists they sit down at 3 a.m. for spaghetti. Scorsese feels so in control of his powerful talent here. It describes crime's allure for an insatiable young man who's determined from childhood beatings not to resent power, but long for it. When Henry talks to us at the beginning, it sounds like a classic Hollywood dream-come-true picture.",10,1,2,8 June 2010
Princess Mononoke," A Film Animal Lovers Will Love: Respect Nature For It Can Destroy You.
","Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans. It's important that they take the message of the film seriously.",9,4,6,24 September 2006
Jurassic Park," The Definitive Evolutionary Thriller
","The father of the summer blockbuster tradition's third time around making the most commercially successful film ever is a real cinema signpost, presenting wonder- and terror-stimulating highlights, the more stunning of these concerning the ferocious, realistic dinosaurs that trail through the film with a still amazing simplicity. Just as intimidating, though, maybe more, are those features of Jurassic Park that determine it as the meteoric forerunner of a mint entertainment kingdom. Even while seizing the imagination of its enormous audience, this film sets the stage for the amusement park rides, sequels and souvenirs that assure the Jurassic Park event would continue for over a decade.The calculation of this cinematic marketing takeover didn't seem like it could be surpassed, because a whole age bracket had become infatuated with dinosaurs, turning the fossils of long ago into the monolithic props of the '90s. This at times almost unbearably intense thriller is still today a riveting, worthily scientific story of a classified theme park, branded for the age throughout which dinosaurs existed. Jurassic Park's centerpiece is actual sentient dinosaurs, which have been produced through the regeneration of dinosaur DNA taken from blood unearthed in prehistoric mosquitoes sealed in amber. The film describes this procedure by way of a 'Mr. D.N.A.' cartoon.Crichton, who adapted his source with David Koepp, relishes such particulars and illustrates his plot as a beguiling, fanatically comprehensive discourse on both the promise and harms of prevailing technology. The coolest character in Crichton's story, wry chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, is among various scientists taken to Jurassic Park to examine it before its opening. Faced with the seeming foolproof environment of this mechanized paradise, Malcolm is incredulous. He repeatedly refers to applied mathematics as a means of indicating that supposedly faultless representations have a way of toppling once they contend with the real world.Theoretically, this plot is custom-made for the talents of the man who could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List, merging the alarm of Jaws with the state-of-the-art parable of E.T. and Close Encounters, and sure enough including the trial of constructing the dinosaurs themselves. In a few key scenes equaling the fright rate of Jaws, the difference is that this film's dinosaurs tread on its humans both literally and metaphorically, however persuasively sympathetic and amusingly distinctive the cast is. They show just for concise interludes, yet the they rule Jurassic Park in every sense. Remarkably fluid and realistic, they set an exorbitant benchmark for the still budding CGI. However, thinking about how those effects were pulled off aren't prone to arise while the film's in progress. The key to the dinosaurs of this undeniable pleasure is that they form a conquering fantasy. We believe we've hung around in a dinosaur-filled realm.That realm, on an island nearby Costa Rica, is the innovation of John Hammond, a tiresomely cheery gray eccentric who enlists Drs. Grant and Sattler as members of a party presumed to give Jurassic Park its stamp of support. But a quaint thing occurs en route to the Tyrannosaurus pen. Thanks to an business saboteur attempting to appropriate dinosaur embryos, power within this programmed theme park is deactivated. Enormous, unpleasant, ravenous creatures begin to roam free.Helming the dinosaurs' exploits is Spielberg's forte, and the professional dreamer's excitement is unmistakable. He has an immense party with every single roar and shudder indicating the advanceing threat, as when Malcolm notices a mud puddle tremble. He also hurdles to the test of composing inspired duels, as in a tremendous sequence where brutal velociraptors hunt Hammond's two grandchildren through the outsized kitchen of the visitor's center. Anybody can show a battle, but it takes Steven Spielberg to portray just how the pots and pans might go soaring at the thump of a velociraptor's tail, or how the children might mislead their cunning assailants. In considering such a scene, it also helps to behold the broader picture. Who but the most represented filmmaker on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time could persuade an audience that there are dinosaurs at large in a kitchen by any means? But the film's deserving centerpiece is the sequence where the Tyrannosaurus scrutinizes and masticates a Jeep containing desperately frozen-stiff characters is one of the most exhilarating scenes ever put on film. It's hopeless discerning the effects from the real, and it's equally as suspenseful when you're 22 as when you're 5.His fourteenth film keeps us nervous while leaving much of its actual brutality to the mind. When it's dinosaur dinner time, Spielberg sidesteps obvious gore, getting a superior quiver out of showing farm animals that are left near the famished creatures and swiftly vanish. To give the velociraptors a fitting initiation, he starts the film with a character whose upper body stays seen while the rest of him is being accosted off screen, a la Jaws. Such tense and gruesome strokes are joined with over-romantic ones and intermittent droll sight gags and observations. As an action adventure, as an auteurist visualization, as a blockbuster, as a humanist assertion, however capitalistically inclined, it's a tour de force.",10,4,5,10 February 2011
The Simpsons Movie," Worth the Wait
","There isn't much you can say about The Simpsons Movie that you can't say about the television show. Its sense of humor has a lot in common with other brutally irreverent cartoons made for older people. It has that same brilliant timing and expression of certain goofy characters' stupidity, but it never gets into as much trouble as South Park because it never gets that direct or crosses the line to the point of self-satirization, and it never gets old the way Family Guy, no matter how addictive it is, can so easily get, because it's patient and indulges in a little thing called plot. The Simpsons Movie has all of these things, and wisely, knowing that its scope must be expanded as a feature-length production, dreams up many wonderful plot ideas and infventively outlandish set pieces that if done in a live action film would be the most mind-blowing spectacles in any film for several years.",8,0,3,13 August 2007
All the President's Men," The Subtle Difference Between Gunshots and Typewriter Keys
","All the President's Men is an action film. But it's comprised not of speeding cars, bombs, fists, gadgets, guns, but of names, dates, phones, happenstance, false leads, relentless footwork, denials, and, like a would-be usual villainous mastermind whose henchmen doggedly protect him, the truth. Just such particulars brought about Watergate and Nixon's resignation, but the movie's more about facts than consequences. It's as precise about the procedures used by investigative reporters as we have any entitlement to require from a movie.Hustling by like a whirlwind at a somewhat sprawling 138 minutes, All the President's Men could stagger a laid-back viewer as easily as astound a researcher doing a frame-by-frame breakdown. It has a faster pulse, tighter tension than any other newspaper movie I can think of, including His Girl Friday, the ones that always exaggerate the exhilaration and discount the tedium and waiting. This one's all about those and the vigorous excavating. It relies on what we already understand about Watergate to supply thrill, yet given that William Goldman's screenplay is virtually all dialogue, director Alan J. Pakula has achieved extraordinary success at keeping snaredrum tension.Who would've thought you could mount such suspense with Bernstein approaching Woodward's desk and eavesdropping on the extension phone? And the movie's so well acted, shot and paced that it expands the drive and energy even in the scenes where Woodward and Bernstein are getting doors shut in their faces. Maybe even especially! The sound throbs, with its suggestive bonding of typewriter keys. The cutting is shrewdly subtle, with its persistent long takes that simply make us sit and fester. Once, we from a wide shot to a medium shot of an interviewee. We've leapt forward as though leaning in to hear, because we, like the reporters, are extremely eager to listen.Collaborating for the third time with Pakula, Gordon Willis memorably flaunts his signature darks in the presentation of Deep Throat, spying an indistinguishable figure hidden in the shadows until he lights a cigarette, the match burning momentarily in a pond of dense black. But unexpectedly, he compellingly uses vivid lights. The Washington Post offices are seen with granular white lighting that throws no shadows, leaves the lines of workspace and typewriters like a shelter of familiarity in a world of dim, treacherous corners.The astonishing, mesmerizing world-class shot that begins as an extreme close-up of library reference cards and slowly widens up, and up, and up, and up, and up, not only dwarfing the cards but making insects out of the human characters, is the most powerful possible statement of the blood, sweat and tears that went into their investigation. Pakula and Willis are with both hyperbole and deadpan grace suggesting that they have to sift through enough cards to fill this whole enormous spectacle of a wide shot, or to at least match it in gall and determination, to rival the enormous power they're up against, which is what is constantly being augmented by the incredibly wide framing.This is cinema's most sharp-eyed survey of working journalists we're ever apt to see. Woodward and Bernstein shall in the end supplant Hildy and Walter as vocation prototypes, thriving exceptionally in implying the fusion of excitement, obsession, self-doubt, and nerve that flooded the Post as they aimed at a presidency. When Robert Redford revealed that he'd acquired the rights to the book, the newsroom gag was about reporters turning into movie stars. It ended up vice versa. Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein drill through their characters and become completely realistic. There's not a put-on or 'Hollywood' footnote in the entire film.Pakula doesn't brood over the personal lives of the characters, but he has a fastidious feel for their professional lives, particularly with their relationships with editors. The Watergate story began as a local story, not a national one. Woodward was Protestant, Bernstein a Jew. Woodward was a Republican, Bernstein a Liberal Democrat. Woodward was an extremely didactic journalist, Bernstein had a jittery impatience. But they had to work together, be professional, objective.We meet the metro editor, Jack Warden's Rosenfeld, protecting and pestering 'Woodstein' as the dynamic duo came to be recognized. Martin Balsam plays Simons, the managing editor, and Jason Robards is Bradlee, the executive editor. All three are perfect. They've learned the exact pitch, they carry on a news meeting like they've held one before, and they even demonstrate characteristic office ways: If you've covered a daily beat, you're entitled to slacken your tie and wear saggy pants.The movie has dozens of minor character roles for all the people who spoke to Woodstein, or declined to. Some of the other roles have a propensity for merging into one mysterious Source, but Robert Walden makes an unforgettable Donald Segretti, the dirty-tricks specialist veiling anguish with bluster. And two crucial informers are played in fascinatingly diverse ways. Jane Alexander is a bookkeeper who gives the team some of their best leads. She's readily understood, frank, nervous. Hal Holbrook, as the mystifying Deep Throat, the source within the administration, is distressingly aloof, practically like he's viewing the proceedings with a vain snicker.There must've been lure to expand upon Woodward and Bernstein, alter the rhythm with subplots about their personal lives, but, like all good action-adventures, the film sticks resolutely to the chase, starting with an apparently minor break-in and following it, almost disbelievingly sometimes, as it ultimately runs all the way up the ladder. The energy of Watergate seems to thrust Woodward and Bernstein, rather than vice versa, just as the ticking bomb or the hostages in the skyscraper do John McClaine or James Bond.",10,3,4,18 May 2011
The Fighter," A Typical Ego Validation Sports Drama Done with Particular Flare and Raw Intimacy
","This heated, pulpy comeback tale about folks who've seen too many of those is quite a customary ringside drama, which in itself is not essentially a condescending assertion. This subgenre's a hard-wearing one and, when done effectively, is extremely involving, predictably upsurging to an encouraging feel-good finish. So by most measures, this highly textural work's done particularly, extremely well.It's the story of a real-life boxer whose career was revived in the late '90's, Mickey Ward, in a physically hard-hitting but emotionally subtle take by Mark Wahlberg. The movie comprises the time before that renaissance, as he strains to choose whether or not to keep his family engaged in his career, chiefly his manager mother, played in another of Melissa Leo's powerfully indomitable, matter-of-fact performances, and his fellow boxer and trainer half-brother Dicky, played by a bizarrely compelling Christian Bale, and his astonishingly intolerant, self-absorbed sisters, whose presence gives Mickey that extra boost of respect from us, as it must've been hell's seventh circle growing up in an isolated household with them.He's swayed to abandon their control by his new girlfriend Charlene, played by an increasingly more impressive Amy Adams. As with several of these movies, the story's not about the sport itself, but instead about the athlete's private ordeals. Here it divulges a depiction of the hurdles and hazards of mingling family with partnership. All actors concerned bestow an emotional thrust that advances toward overflow, director David O. Russell, who ordinarily makes heady comedies, confidently tells a forthright story here. And although I don't have any concrete grievances about this sensationalistic urban fable, from beginning to end it seems exceptionally susceptible to formula exhaustion.It's one of these movies where two iconic leading men reveal to have endured arduous physical transformations out of Method dedication to their roles, as urban tough guys in an insular neighborhood, tackling big dreams, magnetizing relentlessly supportive women in an obsessive, violent battle for general respect. There are emotional training montages set to alternative rock (kudos for using the Chili Peppers), perilous drug habits, borderline-operatic arguments comprised entirely out of 'Bahston' brogues, the trading of insults. There's some innate attraction men have to this material, even apart from its sports-driven subject matter, the notion that the jingoistic warmth of blinkered urban neighborhoods such as these when romanticized on film is appealing, or that men feel they can or aspire to match the resolute gristle of the characters.But the reason this very simple, somewhat tired story's particularly effective's largely due to the authenticity of every character, the cast so strappingly, affectionately worthy as they aim at the brawls that occur among family. Russell has taken a fable of legendary American redemption and one of those Hollywood scripts with way too many writers and come what may fashioned a film so stimulating, genuine and alive with knotty emotions that is feels like a fresh experience. The whole cast pours out remarkably moving performances. If they inevitably spill over the top, Russell's visceral balancing act allows it to feel like just another part of the insulated world he's furnished.Using mostly hand-held cameras, he gives the impression that we're mingling with great curiosity, and it's left purely to his actors to spin the yarn. With its extraordinarily personal temperament that frankly is what makes the movie, Wahlberg and Bale take what could effortlessly become mere stylized pigeonholes and give the story not simply some severity but an unbridled showcase of masculine energy. An interesting aspect is that on the surface, it seems we're supposed to be compelled to lend the spotlight to Bale's bombastic rendering of an inimitably, compulsively watchable character, but it's Wahlberg whose unassuming, tightly internalized performance seems to be dividing critics, which is frankly a good sign, as a figure at odds between his allegiance to the tribe and his duty to himself.Everyone involved seems to simply be letting go: Adams is getting a lot of kudos here because she seems so uncannily secure in a very atypically tough role, one that could've easily been yet another token supportive love interest but, owing to her, is a fully amplified character in the classic sense. And after an anti-war treasure hunt film set in the '91 Iraq uprising and a sociopolitical comedy about philosophy and the meaning of life, Russell seems keen to go back to basics, telling a guileless, unadorned story from the ground up. Even Hoyte van Hoytema, whose delicately measured minimalist lensing of Let the Right One In won him accolades, just hoists the camera onto his shoulder to follow the actors around.Indeed the camera seems to behave similarly to its crassly masculine subjects, confrontationally rushing headlong into close-ups, weaving bumpily past bystanders and panning or tracking either smoothly or explosively depending on the mood it's reacting to. I was also impressed by the moving rendering of Ward's boxing matches, created in a rigorous procedural fashion with real-life commentary and shot with the same Beta-format cameras from early '90s sports broadcasts, giving the scenes a very certain look and a liberty from the inevitable comparisons to the fight sequences in Raging Bull and The Wrestler.So this forceful, consciously in-depth movie, perhaps one of the year's best acting vehicles, wears its heart on its sleeve, but with such a nitty-gritty, aggressively naturalistic style, eschews being syrupy. All of its clichés are simply part of the reality about these characters and the world that the dedicated cast and crew are concerned with illustrating, and its ultimate messiness feels more like a surplus of seratonin than shoddy writing. Therefore, it's an especially uncomplicated movie, and it's trouble-free to write off as merely another sports flick about conquering odds, especially when the conclusion of the film leaves much unresolved, but it's also an especially intimate movie, which is much more valuable.",7,3,7,30 December 2010

When corporations must cut back immediately yet don't like being the bad guy, he flies in and plays the bad guy to the new ex-workers. In economic decline, his enterprise is booming! But eventually, the detachment of the road life is jeopardized by the dawns of firing by Web chat. It may not be as affable as firing someone face to face, however it conserves a lot of money on airfare.This isn't a comedy. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an alert observation of how people in 2009 do their jobs. Bingham adores his profession. He doesn't want a home. He doesn't want a family. He orates self-help speeches on how and why to unpack the backpack of your life. Clooney plays Bingham as one of those people you know yet you never break the ice. They endure all the motions, and make all the appropriate overtures, and you're 'friends,' yet who's in there? There are two women in Bingham's life. Vera Farmiga plays another commercial traveler, and for some time they've been having rendezvous in lifeless 'Suite' hotels, eating, having sex, pretending to be the happy couple neither one will go in on. Anna Kendrick, who was terrific in the 2007 buried gem Rocket Science, here plays a promising, driven new graduate who has acquired an opening at Bingham's company as it's close to her boyfriend. Bingham takes her on the road to show her the business. Farmiga is him now, Kendrick is him then.You probably won't peg all that Farmiga is thinking. Kendrick's character is bursting with such liveliness at the advent of her career that it radiates even on the departures of others'. Nothing better than pleasing your employer. The movie's strongest scenes by far involve Farmiga or Kendrick. Farmiga is so completely real and becoming that everything she says is worlds better than anyone else would probably put it in as little time and words and with as little effort as her. And the scene where Clooney puts Kendrick on the spot and tells her to fire him while he fires one hypothetical curveball question after another is pitch-perfect in its razor-sharp and rapid-fire reminiscence of a classic Howard Hawks picture.I like how Reitman begins with the way corporations rationalize degenerate methods and then administer their justifications with seamless coherence. That approach was at the heart of his exceptional debut, Thank You for Smoking. Reitman also made the cute but phenomenally overrated Juno. With these three films at the outset of his career, we can just wonder what's coming up. He makes clever, subversive commercial films. That's more of a challenge than making clever, subversive art-house films.",9,1,3,1 May 2010
Atonement," A Magically Crafted Film
","As a lifelong admirer of movies, I have come to believe that everyone has a cinematic sense, the way they would envision of a film of their own. Atonement beautifies my own cinematic sense, thus I relate so intensely to director Joe Wright's techniques. Though he admits to his beautiful, emotional, near logistically impossible tracking shot that entirely composes the powerful Dunkirk evacuation sequence as showing off, that doesn't matter, because the impression with which it furnishes us is that of an uninterrupted perspective, not James McAvoy's but ours as we behold the juxtaposition of what he is ceaselessly seeing and his reaction to it. Each scene is its own self-contained short film, almost as if Kurosawa had directed this film. Kurosawa was never as hyperkinetic or confronting as Wright, the visual language of Atonement has the same tautness and precision serving as genesis of an emotional response as Sanjuro, Seven Samurai, or One Wonderful Sunday.Wright's meticulous stylization is thorough and consistent, as it isn't simply lathered on top of the story but is essentially the storyteller, enhancing and driving the story, segregating itself as its own version of Ian McEwan's novel, rather than simply a novel told on film. Each scene flows seamlessly into the next, a tremendous credit that goes to the editing as well as the already honored cinematography, creating an amalgam of each character's point of view of the same events, their different reactions, our own reactions, the achingly longed-for fantasies the characters attempt to will into reality, and of course reality itself.Keira Knightley and McAvoy are airtight within the feelings and personal interpretations of an upper-English student and the son of her parents' housekeeper sharing an obstructed and undying love and animal attraction, however it is Saoirse Ronan, the young girl who plays the 13-year-old version of Knightley's avidly creative younger sister, portraying a stage in the younger sister's life that has yet to realize the overwhelming regret she will endure. It's Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of her in the final stage of her life that almost magically reflects Ronan, something you cannot just plan.Despite recent achievements in American film that have shattered standards and transcended the capabilities of each aspect of the medium, Atonement outdoes in both departments. It's hard to bring to mind the last time I saw a movie so alive in all departments. I was even fascinated with the way people smoked in the film. Even the music goes beyond the expectations of even masterfully done films, as it takes the form of the uniform sounds recognized in the characters' lives, masking itself as the many-sensed rhythm of the story.2007 is a tremendous year for American movies, one of the best in its history. It would only be right for Atonement to receive the praise, recognition, and accolades with which other masterpieces of 2007 are awash.",10,5,8,20 May 2008
The Godfather," This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.
","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.",10,12,24,4 October 2008
