Requiem for a Dream," A Realistic Movie about Drugs with a clear message :they will destroy you
","What a movie I lost over the years!!!, Requiem for a Dream appeared in 2000 and I only watched this year(2008)The story has three main characters and their life will never be the same after taking drugs.The time line is slowly taking a bad route as the drugs are starting to take a more bigger effect on Sara(Ellen Burstyn),Harry(Jared Leto)and Marion(Jennifer Connelly)each actor giving a great performance.From this time the movie turn's in a highly temperature.The soundtrack 'Lux Aeterna' (Latin, Lux Æterna: 'the eternal light')a composition by Clint Mansell is a memorable one ,perfect match with the movie's atmosphere it is used in popular culture outside the film, mostly in film trailers.A piece on movie history do not miss it!",10,0,0,31 December 2008
The Notebook," Maybe The Greatest Romantic Movie of The 2000's
","Romance at it's best. It's all I have to say. Just the opening off this movie is simply amazing an the following will not let you down.If you think back this movie is build up a little bit like Titanic: we have an old character who tells the story off the original couple. The exception is that here we will not loose anyone from the couple. Anyway it looks like this old character storytelling about it's young love life is successful , I hope it would be used more often.Noah and Allie's story start's with a funny sequence where Noah is asking Allie to go out with him.First Allie rejects him but later she will fall in love in Noah even more. They get separated later by Allie's parents but their story is far from being ended.There is a superb scene in the movie where Noah takes Allie in the river on a boat with that beautiful background what is one of the greatest romantic scenes in movie history.Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, Nick Cassavetes directed a superb and beautiful movie that will stand the test off time.",9,0,1,31 October 2011
The Great Dictator," An entertaining comedy with a great end speech
","The Great Dictator is Chaplin's parody about the Nazi Germany with scenes that make you laugh no matter in what mood you are.Beside this ,from my point of view the movie's best part is the superb speech by the Jewish Barber ,a speech's thoughts that if would existed a little bit in Hitler's mind too it would had a chance for the world too pas a second world war.The Speech: 'I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.That's not my business.I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.I should like to help everyone: Jew, gentile, black man, white.We all want to help one another.Human beings are like that.We want to live by each other's happiness, not misery.We don't want to hate one another.In this world, the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.The way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way.Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into bloodshed.We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in.Machinery has left us in want.Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.We think too much and feel too little.More than machinery we need humanity.More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...The airplane and radio have brought us closer.These inventions cry out for the goodness in man, cry out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.Even now my voice is reaching millions, millions of despairing men, women and children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.The misery upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took will return to the people.So long as men die liberty will never perish.Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives, tell you what to think and feel, who drill you, treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder.Don't give yourselves to these men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in you.Don't hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty! St Luke says, 'The Kingdom of God is within man.' Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you! You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.You have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.In the name of democracy, let us use that power.Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.Promising these things, brutes have risen.But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!'",9,12,16,2 November 2008
Crash," A great movie about the complex human relations
","In my point of view this movie is one of the best movies of the 2000's.The biggest issues presented in this movie are racism and the misunderstandings that can lead from the smallest to the biggest problems.In this thought can be included the chain reaction of scenes what start's when the store owner does not understand than in order to be fixed the store's lock ,first it has to be repaired the door.But despite this he is accusing the repairer that he is cheating and it will not be paid.This lead's to a war between them with a miraculous end what is explained later with a simple fact. Another memorable piece from the movie is when officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) shot's Peter (Lorenz Tate) thinking that the passenger will point a gun to him.Later too destroy the evidence Tom burn's his car what later it will be a worming object to some kids and too Cameron (Terrence Howard) who at last find's peace in his soul.An other great theme of the movie is the human personality sometimes ugly, sometimes beautiful.This is perfectly exampled when in a moment officer John Ryan (Matt Dillon) is molesting a woman in the front of his husband and in another he saves her from a mortal crash.(From this scene is the movie's title inspired) Mark Isham's soundtrack is greatly matching with the movie and Bird York's single 'In The Deep' in the scene when everyone find's peace inside is the picture's highpoint.Best movie made by Paul Haggis",10,2,5,23 February 2009
The Polar Express," A superb Christmas adventure
","Beside the 'Back to the Future' trilogy we have another masterpiece from Robert Zemeckis .Known for he's passion for special effects ,there aren't missing either from this movie. But not the effects make the big value off the movie, the great Christmas spirit does.There is a wonderful story about a boy who does not believe and make a journey to the north pole with the Polar Express.There is great excitement until the train arrives to the pole, only that worth's watching the movie.The Christmas backgrounds are great the colors are beautiful. Let us hope that we all get to hear the bell ringing.",9,2,4,25 December 2010
Watchmen," Greatest Movie With Multiple Superheroes
","I never seen in my life a comic book movie so complex, smart, complete. It is full with thoughts about the human nature what lead's eventually to it's existence.Just like the Comedian said mankind always wanted to kill each other , now it has the power to finish the job.The movie is about a group of superheroes contributing with their role to make this a better world. One of them gets killed in the 80's in the time of the cold war. The US are sure that if the war would start they would surely win with Dr. Manhattan at their side.Dr. Manhattan is some kind of a god-like being after he was disintegrated in an Intrinsic Field Subtractor in 1959. He criticizes the human nature that it has the self destruction on it and he want's to leave this place.Most of the actors stand up for their job specially Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan / Jon Osterman and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Edward Blake / Comedian.Zack Snyder at his best ,it could not been made a better movie, it is beautiful and unforgettable.",9,2,5,22 December 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ' 2001: A Life Oddysey'
","With no doubt this outstanding movie in my opinion as a trilogy with the 'Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King' are representing the top movies of the decade, maybe the best ever. Peter Jackson made with his movie a picture of Life with every detail of it.I haven't read the book because I have to admit I'm not a big book reader :) , but I'm sure Peter Jackson did a master job making a movie with Tolkien's book because the result is on the screen.It was told that the Lord of The Rings book can never be turned into a movie because is to complicated and long. Well...The movie's genre is Fantasy but this movie has so much themes on it that it can be considered universal.We have a superstar cast including Elijah Wood, Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean ,Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and many other great actors to give a bigger value to the movie with their performance.The Fellowship of the Ring starts the biggest adventure faced on screen what will end only in the third movie of the trilogy 'The Return of the King'.This picture has a loot of philosophical thoughts on it to with many unforgettable quotes ,my favorites are : -Gandalf: 'All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you' -Arwen: 'I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the Ages of this world alone'.In my opinion Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring is the biggest and the most greatest fight between good and evil in the history of cinema.Howard Shore's soundtrack is excellent ,Enya's May it be is the hope of better times ,exactly what the movie's end is trying to tell us. Sit back and enjoy maybe the biggest movie in history. Thank You Peter Jackson and J.R.R. TolkienUniversal and Timelles",10,2,2,3 January 2009
Spider-Man," 'Who am I? I'm Spider-Man!'
","A favorite of my.End of discussion. When I first seen it in cinema I knew it that it going too be.And it still is even if it past almost a decade from the release.The movie leaved in me the feeling of the super heroism what brings too responsibility in a way that no other superhero movie did.Beside the great story of Spider-Man, in this first movie the atmosphere is greatly managed with the great romance between Peter and M.J. (The Spider-Man Kiss winning MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss).The action is great, there are a lots of funny moments in the movie, specially when Jonah Jameson the publisher of the 'Daily Bugle' is on the scene, and the money spend on the movie can be felled in every moment of the picture.Tobey Maguire is great as Spider-Man , and the rest of the cast the same.With no doubt on of the best comic-book adaptation, the movie made his expectations in every way Thank's Sam Raimi",9,0,1,22 November 2010
Drive," Long Live Real Heroes!
","The movie is a perfect contender to be later a great classic. Drive is somehow capable to bring back something from the Dollars Trilogy. It is felt like Ryan Gosling continues what Clint Eastwood did in his famous trilogy. Protecting the weak ones.Gosling's character is an unnamed Driver who also works as a mechanic, stuntman and getaway driver. He has a little bit strange personality ,not to talking ,just doing his job... Later he meets his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and starts to have feelings for her. When Irene's husband ,Standard (Oscar Isaac) comes back home from prison he finds out that Standard owes protection money to a gangster, Cook. In order to protect Irene and her family it gets start the war between the Driver and the mob that will come with superb action ,some 'The Fast and the Furious' like scenes and some hard core violence. The scene when the Driver comes in a mask to take out one of his big targets Nino, a Jewish mobster (Ron Perlman, who also I would to ad matched perfectly with his role), is one of my favorites, I knew then that the movie has what has to have a classic.Most of all Drive's great value is the never ending fight and the morality that the driver has to fight off the trouble between people. And of course the great romance.The 'A Real Hero' soundtrack is perfect in the movie , makes a beautiful atmosphere to it, Clint Eastwood's legacy can long live on.",9,2,5,7 April 2012
Kick-Ass," A new comic book genre
","I was expecting another some kind of a superhero parody, but no this was different ,this movie had it all, it shocked me, it's way better than I expected.The movie appears to be a parody but is not , it has much more than that, there are elements from movies like 300, Kill Bill, elements from movies like Spider-Man ,Batman , elements from movies like The Punisher, Street Kings, elements from movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas, elements from movies like Superhero Movie which I think is very underrated, this is a movie with five elements.Director Matthew Vaughn made a great job assembling these elements and it turn out a superb movie.Sit back and enjoy.",9,10,16,6 February 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Come What May
","Come What May, this will be the greatest love musical of all time. Baz Luhrmann's movie with it's great colors, visuals bring you to a dream world from where you don't want to escape.Another great achievement of the movie is the superb singing's of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, they perform like some professional singers and these love songs melt them together.The lyrics of the songs that are used in the movie make a big impact ,making it a great singing about love. 'Come What May' is newly written for the stage and the only original song used in the movie, Elton John's 'Your Song' is although greatly matching.Moulin Rouge is dedicated to Baz Luhrmann's father, Leonard Luhrmann, who died before filming. Rest in peace he got a superb movie for remembering.",10,0,1,21 October 2011
Grave of the Fireflies," The Graves of those who can never be forgotten
","Like other top Japanese animation movies this is another great one,and is in my top 3.Isao Takahata's movie from the novel off Akiyuki Nosaka who lost his sister in the war inspired him to wrote this tragic story.Animation historian's rank this movie one off the greatest ever made.The movie takes place in the end of World War II in Japan,Kobe and tales the tale of two orphaned children,Seita and his young sister Setsuko. The battle off surviving and starvation in that brutal time gives to the movie an effect that makes it one of the most powerful anti-war movies ever made.",9,0,1,28 July 2011
Titanic," The Top of the Pyramid
","The movie is a total perfection.When it appeared back in 1997 and i watched for the first time it leaved an influence on me what no other movie had. Maybe The Lord Of The Rings ,maybe not :), that movie is another greatness of the film-making.Coming back too Titanic with the record $1,835,300,000 Worldwide Box Office that is still no.1 after 11 years is amazingly great.I cannot understand the users of IMDb because this movie is not in the top 250 movies . That is shame ,this movie it is at least in the top 5 greatest movies ever not too mention in the top 250 .A movie at least 8-9 out of 10 ,IMDB USERS!!! Wake Up and see the movie again because you seen something else. I cannot find another top with movies somewhere else where Titanic is not included.The movies prior theme beside the ship's history is the greatest human feeling :love what is universal and timeless.The picture presents us the meaning of true love. Our main characters Jack the poor artist and Rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or not.Inn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our life.We'll we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever. With no doubt this is the best movie directed by James Cameron, among his other great achievements. James Horner's soundtrack is simply beautiful and completely matches with the movie ,there is no surprise that his soundtrack album has been sold with 30 million copy'sThe movie is the greatest achievement in cinema ,it is the top of the pyramid...",10,15,28,30 August 2008
The Fountain," Darren Aronofsky is great at every genre!
","With Requiem for a Dream he made maybe the best drug-drama movie.With Pi he succeeded a mathematical thriller.With Black Swan he traveled us in the darkest levels off the human mind. With The Fountain he made a really beautiful Science Fiction Movie which has the main themes of philosophy: life, death, time&space.The movie is separated in three story set in three different time.Each story tells something to the next one and at the final off the movie we will have the puzzle complete.The main line off the puzzle is the love between Tomas and Isabel. Tomas would give everything to save Isabel even if that means to defeat death.He calls it a disease and he wants to find it's cure.The roles are played greatly by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz.",9,2,4,14 October 2011
Arrival," Arrival of a great and refreshing alien movie.
","After movies like Prisoners,Sicario and now Arrival we can put Denis Villeneuve to the arrival of the great directors club. He can make a unique atmosphere to a movie that makes you stuck to the screen from beginning to end. Now this is what happens in the case of Arrival. We have a great story, not the usual alien invasion movie genre, here we have an alien race that try's to communicate with humanity. Linguistic professor Louise Banks(Amy Adams)with the help off Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner)try to solve this mystery. The first appearances of the Heptapods is super amazing, the atmosphere is great, the communication methods of the creatures are quite impressive.Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer created a fully functioning, visual, alien language. Heisserer, Vermette and their teams managed to create a 'logogram bible,' which included over a hundred different completely operative logo-grams, seventy-one of which are actually featured in the movie.﻿Amy Adams is great as the lead actor, in big pictures her story is the prior story of the movie in my opinion, makes you think about much more then a movie, makes you think about life and the time that is given to it.",9,0,5,5 April 2017
Prometheus," Follows the structure of Alien and the philosophy of Blade Runner
","It Looks like Ridley Scott successfully copied the theme and the form of his two beloved classics: Alien and Blade Runner into a new movie called Prometheus.The movie has a familiar story of Alien: a team is sent to look for Extraterrestrial life in another planet. Of course things go wrong and (...)We have some philosophical descent from Blade Runner with questions like who are we? why are we here? where are we going?. The scientist try to answer these questions with this big mission. The movie has the great suspense like Alien has, we have here a new 'Ripley' called Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and in the end we truly can make Prometheus relative to Alien.In the end it came out a great Science Fiction and Ridley Scott's earlier movies now can live on the present.",8,3,10,13 August 2012
The Matrix," In matter of philosophy and visual effects it is still breathtaking
","'A Virtual Science Fiction that went on the world like a hurricane effect' - this publication on a magazine made me to see The Matrix as soon as possible.After I seen the movie i was fascinated. It made me too see it again in a row in about 3 times.It is really a bounder-breaking picture.We can be amazed for the first time by the bullet time and time freezing techniques, it is really great to see the camera rolling in 360 degrees and to view the same picture.The Matrix is played in the future where the machines are ruling the world. They are using mankind for an energy source and using 'The Matrix' program too make believe the human mind that the body is really living.The mankind is almost eliminated ,it is remained only a city 'Zion' .From this city a rebellion ship named the Nebuchadnezzar and it's team free a mind from The Matrix who later will be the one.He's name is Neo and he will be the one and on he's hand will depend the freedom of mankind.The Matrix has been awarded with 4 Oscars in 2000 :Best Sound ;Best Editing ;Best Effects,Sound Effects Editing ;Best Effects,Visual Effects .In other matters it is a great philosophical movie with other big questions like where does mankind hading ,or the origin of humanity.This title is also a warning that if we are not careful machines one day may take out the control.After all these years it is still a 'huriccane' movie what inspired a lot of upcoming titles whit it's superb effects.It is a total piece of greatness a must see in all meaning",10,1,1,14 September 2008
Braveheart," One of the Greatest Existed Hero Story ever told
","Ending narration of the movie: 'In the year of our Lord, 1314, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsmen. And won their freedom.' This movie is beautiful as this quote.This second film directed by Mel Gibson is a true masterpiece.It tells the story of William Wallace, Scotland's greatest hero.It is truly bring back to life the spirit, the way how William Wallace successfully could bring back hope to Scotland for freedom and independence from England.The soundtrack for Braveheart was composed and conducted by James Horner what makes the movie even more perfect.Braveheart won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.",10,2,6,7 April 2012
Her," Artificial Romance
","Spike Jonze's movies had all the time some great fantasy that always were worth to watch. In 'Being John Malkovich' was a really interesting idea to put people in John Malkovich's skin and in 'Where the Wild Things Are' it was great to enter in Max's imaginary world.This time we have a really interesting theme about a lonely person and a futuristic Operating System's 'Love Affair'. It sounds weird but it came out a remarkable story.Theodore is a letter writer just after divorce when OS1, an operating system with consciousness is put to market. He starts the program , the OS asks some questions , including to have male or female voice, some personal questions, then reboots and gives birth to 'Samantha'.The great fact about this movie is that you almost forget that the love story is between a Human and a Computer. Joaquin Phoenix (Theodore) and Scarlett Johansson as Samantha's voice make such a great performance that result a movie a Romantic Tragedy.'Her' makes me think about the complicated future and the potential self-aware Operating System - Human relationships.Until then sit back and enjoy this great movie.",10,5,9,28 August 2014
Jurassic Park," After 65 Million Years they are back
","I remember when i first seen this movie i was fascinated. It became my favorite movie. A started too complete Jurassic Park albums pictures ,everything that had something too do with the movie.I seen the first time the movie in TV because i had only 6 years when it was in big screen. I remember that it was a big dinosaur mania at that time.The movie has one of the greatest achievement of Industrial Light&Magic. It was revolutionary ,dinosaurs had never locked better in screen.The movie's director Steven Spielberg can be really proud of his film.The picture's story is in our time .The dinosaurs are cloned from the blood of a prehistoric mosquito and it is made a Park for them. My favorite scene is when the T-Rex meets the two car in the big rain.The movie has 2 more episode the third maybe a little bit weaker then the others.After 65 Million Years they were back and it was a big step in film-making",10,2,4,28 July 2008
