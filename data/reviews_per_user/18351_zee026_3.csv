The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good, I can fast forward the whole movie.
","I am not going to go into details. I will try to keep it short. It was as expected, a totally dull movie. Looks like it was made for a TV release.I can understand that it is a formula movie, where the producers and directors are cashing on the market for certain type of viewers that are really suckers for these Teenage, rebellion, Ohh I am so special, will do things on my own terms type stuff. But it was sad to see that they didn't even bothered to make some effort and make it more interesting and viewable. Saw the whole movie in like 30 min and was still bored to death.Good going guys, cant wait to see the next garbage(actual word removed) sequel of this franchise.",2,10,13,20 February 2015
Wonder Woman," What a Chick Flick, totally a led down.
","I went to see Wonder Woman but end up seeing Pretty Woman. What a let down, Wonder Woman was more of runway Super model then a Super Warrior.I am sure all the ladies really loved all her deep, romantic, sentimental moments. Because other than that, no efforts were made to make the movie interesting. No time in the whole movie, she looked like the Queen of Amazon, more like the Queen of Drama. Just wanted to say to the director, you go girl.",3,4,13,6 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What a loss, what a crap... Of a movie
","What a loss. Sad to see Star Wars in this way... Bunch of hormone confused teens running around, jumping like its high school.Disney just messed up a great franchise...Villain turns out to be a pretty boy... What a messRey, what a joke. She just doesn't fit any where...Rey just defeated a trained Jedi without any training... Great now what Ewoks shooting down star fighter with sling shots...Fin, who the hell is he, how the hell only this storm trooper got a conscious.Can't see such this any more",3,16,23,24 December 2015
