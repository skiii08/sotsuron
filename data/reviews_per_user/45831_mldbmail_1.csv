Blade Runner 2049," A second Blade Runner that's only half as good
","I was delighted to find out they were making a Blade Runner
sequel. The original movie really was and perhaps still is
the ne plus ultra of cinematic storytelling.After having watched the sequel I was dissapointed on every
level. The only reason I kept watching was the deliberated
cinematography and the soundtrack, both pastiches of the
original but still very much quality compared to most of
the last 15 years of holywood output. I did however expect 
the visuals and soundtrack to push the envelope and deliver
something fresh.Plot for this story when compared to the original, again
had its moments and again failed to push the envelope and
deliver something fresh.Questions must be asked about why they bothered with such
a mediocre sequel. We could have had another cinematic
event instead.",5,2,4,5 January 2018
