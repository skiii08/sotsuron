Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Extremely Disappointing
","I'll keep it brief - I WAS a fan of Star Wars. Any one who says this movie is a masterpiece clearly has no right reviewing films. This 'film', if I can call it that, is more calculated and commercial than any piece-of-garbage summer flick to come down the pipe in quite some time. It almost makes Godzilla look heartfelt. Lucas has sold out big time, not that he hadn't done so earlier, but this is really reaching new lows. Perhaps George should take a little time to examine why he started making films so long ago. Make a statement, for God's sake put your heart fully into something. What do the words 'Jar-Jar' mean to you, well thats the entire movie as far as I'm concerned. The Phantom Menace is 'Jar-Jar'. One big fake cartoon made to entertain the slow-witted and create toy-consuming zombies of us all. Do you really believe there is a shred of dignity left in the series after this tired piece of crap. It is a shame, I actually respected good-old George for a period of time.",3,0,1,15 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Already Overrated
","Although the film has many positive points including of course the amazing production design, cinematography, and Mr. Depp's fine performance; it is marred by Tim Burton's lack of storytelling ability and serious script problems. Although I am a fan of Mr. Burton's film style, I cannot stress enough how constantly disappointed I am with his inability to create compelling and moving films. As he excels at the visual arts, Burton lacks the talent to create films that move you in the slightest way. Sleepy Hollow, as well as many of his other films, does not leave the viewer with a feeling of anything throughout its proceeding as well as after the film is over. Literally, it is washed from your palette as soon as you leave the theater. Completely forgettable. The film does not amply supply scares, excitement, humor, romance, drama, surprises, any emotion. A good film does not need all of the previous characteristics but it should provide at least one in good supply or a clever balancing of many. Sleepy Hollow is not boring but never is it actually interesting. The Disney cartoon made many years ago was more compelling. Mr. Burton is no doubt a very talented visionary but he does not move his viewers. I like movies that compel me to watch them a second time, Sleepy Hollow makes me sad that I even watched it once. 5 out of 10. PS- Ms. Ricci's acting severely lacked something to be desired.",5,1,2,22 November 1999
