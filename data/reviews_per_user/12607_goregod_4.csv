Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great movie!! George hits another grand slam!
","I have already seen it twice! Great the first time, even better the second. Ignore anything you have heard negative about this movie and GO SEE IT! Of course its not The Empire Strikes Back. But it surely lives up to the name, STAR WARS!!",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Titanic," You probably like Scream too
","The Greatest film of all time? HMMM.I vowed to never watch the film, but I did. What a waste of time and 2 video cassettes. I did give the film a chance. I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film. This is not even close to being the greatest film of all time, It is not even a good movie.Check out Reservoir Dogs, The Star Wars Trilogy, Predator, even This Boys Life (A good DiCaprio film).",1,22,50,26 February 1999
Scream," This Film Is Not Horror, It's Crap!!!
","This has to be one of the worst excuses for a horror/suspense movie I have ever seen. If you want to watch a real horror film watch: Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lucio Fulci's Zombie, The Evil Dead, The Phantasm series, Eaten Alive, Maniac, or e-mail me and I can tell you many more. Scream sucked. I watched it with a friend and my brother. We all had the killer figured out early into the movie. I cannot belive this movie is called violent or gory. If you want to see gory watch the girl puke up her guts in 'the gates of hell'. If you want to see a bunch of trendy teen agers then watch this but if you want to watch a horror film, then don't watch scream.",Null,0,1,18 April 1999
Scream," What is the deal?
","This was a dull, unoriginal film. Get over it. It was poorly acted, written, and I was not even sure if the prelude was supposed to be scary, and yet it was supposed to be. Within 10 minutes me and my friend had figured ..... It really kept me guessing. Then it was followed by a solid hour of boredom and trendy 23 year olds playing 16.16 year olds don't sit around at school and talk like they did or discuss a fellow students death in the manner they did. They would cry and mourn and make a big deal about it. Trust me, I know. Adam Lee. I could see the ending coming from a mile away. Oh well, I have wasted enough time.",Null,0,1,24 January 1999
