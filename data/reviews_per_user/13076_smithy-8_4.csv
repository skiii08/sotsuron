Vertigo," How to Meet a Guy Hitchcock Style
","This is Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.  'Vertigo' should have won the Academy Award for best picture in 1958.  The Academy Awards ignore this movie for all the major categories.  This was Kim Novak's best performance.
When you see a love scene today, you must endure embarrassment with nudity and graphic love scenes.  The best erotic love scene was between James Stewart and Kim Novak when they were standing with grey suits on.",10,2,3,20 October 2003

The Caine Mutiny," Bogart's Best Movie
","When I was a Seaman at Memphis in the 1970's, I was doing night duty at the Enlisted Men's Club, the sailors watched only two movies:  'The Caine Mutiny' and 'Mr. Roberts.'  They would rather watch those two movies on television than drink or listen to music.  'The Caine Mutiny' is one of the best ensemble movies ever made; also, it is the last great war movie.  Back in the studio days in Hollywood, you could afford to have many top leading actors in one movie.  All the actors gave great performances in this movie, but the actors Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson, Tom Tully, and Robert Francis gave their best performances. 
Humphrey Bogart gave a performance that was totally unlike himself.  Most of his performances were part of his colorful personality.  In 'The Caine Mutiny', he was nothing like the paranoid Navy captain.  Fred MacMurray plays another great heel, and Jose Ferrer plays another heroic, dashing guy. The Academy Awards should have an award for best ensemble acting.  'The Caine Mutiny' would have won that award hands down!",10,42,72,17 November 2003
Doctor Zhivago," Revisiting Dr. Zhivago
","When I first saw 'Dr. Zhivago' in 1965, I thought it a silly, overrated soap opera.  Thirty eight years later, I like it better but it is not a great love story, but it is enjoyable. I still think Geraldine Chaplin jumps in Omar Sharif's arms too much, and Mr. Sharif cries too much. 
As far as Rod Steiger, Tom Courtenay, Rita Tushingham, and Alec Guinness goes, they gave the best performances.  This is the only time Rod Steiger was a romantic lead, and he was the villain.  What happened to Rita Tushingham? She should be in more movies.  The TV version of 'Dr. Zhivago' should be interesting.  Will it be better?",9,1,2,30 October 2003
