The Ring," Exceeded My High Expectations
","Wow.  I'm always on the lookout for a good, truly scary movie.  Y'all, this one fits the bill.  I put The Ring way up there on the list of scary movies, right alongside The Shining, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist.  In fact, I had not experienced such a room-filling sense of deep dread and fear in a theater since I saw the recent re-release of The Exorcist.  The nightmarish imagery was very unsettling and the peak moments of horror were very well timed.  It wasn't perfect, though.  The non-scary parts didn't come off nearly as well as the scary parts.  Not the greatest acting during the 'straight' parts of the movie, and some of the dialogue was pretty weak.  But when the scary parts were on screen (which, fortunately, was most of the time) it made up for the little deficiencies, and then some.From seeing the very-creepy trailer, I had high hopes for The Ring.  But I didn't expect what I got.  This movie will stick with you, folks.  And if you're a horror fan, that's a good thing.Why can't more horror movies have this kind of impact?",9,0,0,1 November 2002
Resident Evil," Well done!
","Not only is this the best movie to come from a video game since Paul Anderson's own Mortal Kombat (RE may have even topped MK), it's the best American zombie movie in ages!  Sure, it could have been more atmospheric (the RE games provide a feeling of dread that the movie didn't equal) and there could have been more gore, but as it is, it's still an astounding effort.  The creature effects were good (though the CG-ness of some of them was too noticeable), the zombies were creepy and relentless, and Milla Jovovich was fantastic (and hot!)  It ain't quite Night Of The Living Dead or Return Of The Living Dead but it's better than most of the Italian gore-fests, and certainly worth seeing a time or two.",8,1,1,18 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Brilliant beyond words...
","Once again, the world is treated to a work of art disguised as glorious, rousing entertainment.  The Return Of The King is exciting, heart-breaking, and mind-blowing in its scope, scale, and spectacle.  Even moreso than the first two films, believe it or not.  Surely we'll see some major Academy Awards for Return Of The King.The Lord Of The Rings movies have been a blessing to us all, the kind of films that will stand tall until the end of the world.  They are worthy of the great books that they adapt, and are a testament to the depth and breadth of the story that Tolkien gave us.Hail to Peter Jackson and the crew that brought the films to life.  Hail to the cast, who flawlessly portrayed the characters that so many of us have loved for many, many years.Hail to the King.",10,0,0,17 December 2003
Donnie Darko," Strange and Wonderful
","Donnie Darko is definitely not an average Hollywood movie.  It's dark and mysterious and strangely beautiful.  It's the kind of movie you want to watch again immediately, just to figure out what the heck happened.  Great performances throughout.  Donnie Darko belongs will soon be added to my dvd collection.",8,1,1,22 March 2002
