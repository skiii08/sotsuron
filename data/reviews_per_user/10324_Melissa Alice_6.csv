The Sound of Music," A family movie that used to be my favorite!
","This move was my very favorite a few years ago, and I watched it so many times that I got a little tired of it. =o)  I still like it, though.  The songs are fun to sing along with, and the cast is good.  I still love the puppet show!",8,2,9,3 February 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great special effects, and very exciting--not my favorite, however
","I really enjoyed the movie.  Seeing it in the theater was a neat experience, and I loved the special effects, scenery, and acting.Having never read any of the books by Tolkien, I can't say much about that, except that my friends who did read the books thought it looked a lot like they imagined it, but that they did cut out quite a bit (but most movies that are based on books have many differences).It was good that there was no swearing or immorality...There was a lot of violence, but not the same bloody gore as some movies have.  Even though Tolkien was a Christian, the story is not really 'Christian,' and I don't agree with the use of a 'good wizard'.  It is good against evil, with the good side winning in the end.  Enjoyable, but still not my favorite movie.",7,0,0,9 February 2002
The Patriot," Dramatic
","I don't like violence, and this movie had lots of it and some gruesome scenes, but the story was more than just about a war, it was about a family, individual lives of very human people who fought for their country.  I don't think all the British were so brutal during the war, and I can see why some people would be offended at the portrayal of the cruel Tavington and other British.  There were cruel people on both sides of the war, I'm sure (Tavington was the most cruel in the movie, though).Overall, I thought the movie was very dramatic and riveting, with good acting and suspenseful moments and emotional moments (yes, I was crying). It would have been even more emotional (and too gruesome) seeing it on a big screen.  I wouldn't recommend it to young children.The little girls on the movie were cute.  The young girl who played Susan was a good actress, and the scene where she finally cried 'Papa!' and ran to him was very emotional.It's a powerful movie, showing war in all it's awful reality and the families that were separated by it.",8,1,2,29 December 2000
The Princess Bride," A funny, adventuresome and romantic movie!
","I enjoy this movie very much, and I think most people would if they watched it!  There are a few objectionable things, but over all I think it is good. There are lots of funny lines that our family has memorized and that we repeat once in a while.",8,1,2,31 January 2000
To Kill a Mockingbird," There is a wonderful depth and mystery to the movie...
","I watched the movie for the first time yesterday, and it was very interesting to me.  I'm 18 years old, and not from the south, but the kids' playing reminds me a bit of playing with my brothers and sisters when I was growing up.  Everything was a mystery and adventure.  The kids did an excellent job of acting, and the little girl who played Scout had never even acted or been trained in acting before!  There was a great depth to the characters and a great mysterious aura to the Radley house.  Gregory Peck, as usual, did a great job in his part, and the man who played Tom Robinson did, too.  For me it was a riveting movie, though there were no explosions or shoot-outs or high-tech graphics.  It was plain and simple but effective. There were some funny moments, some scary moments, some emotional moments. I saw it in the original B&W on DVD...At first I wished I could see it in color, but then I thought making it in B&W gave it more mystery and interest.  The 'Fearful Symmetry' (making of the movie) was very interesting, too, talking about what we have lost as a country, even while we have gained things. After watching the movie, I think I'll have to read the book, and I'm sure it won't be a waste of time!",8,0,0,12 January 2002
The Truman Show," It's definitely unique...
","This movie is weird but interesting, and I doubt anyone would say it was the 'same old'.  I haven't seen any other movie like it.  After the initial humor and laughs, I felt sorry for the poor guy (Truman) trapped in the make-believe world.  Some of it is just crazy, but at least it keeps your attention pretty much all the way through, though I think it does get a little tiresome towards the end.  The movie is creative (though unrealistic), and has quite a few funny moments.  Definitely not my favorite movie--but it's unique. =)",5,0,2,16 June 2001
