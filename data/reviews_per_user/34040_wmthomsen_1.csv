Requiem for a Dream," Just plain amazing
","To start off, I came into this movie with unknowing expectations. I have always been wanting to see it I have heard it was an amazing movie. So I finally watched it and wow it was an amazing thrill ride and i mean that in every sense. You did drops, loops and everything else the movie could through at you.Every scene was beautifully done. Some I really felt weren't as necessary, but I saw why they added them. For those who don't know what I am talking about it was the whole second meeting with Tim scene.I do not want to give away the ending, but that was an ending I was not expecting. Well I expected part of it, but not the full thing.This movie really gets you in the head of drug addicts and also a mother who is addicting to diet pills (speed)",10,1,2,31 March 2010
