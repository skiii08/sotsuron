Casablanca," Simplicity and Characterization
","This great film is a stunning example of what one can do with a simple story, atmosphere, and characters!  Where are all these great character actors of the 30s and 40s when we need them.  Why does it seem that only the British and Russians can use great characters that seem so real?  Will there ever be another Dooley Wilson, or Claude Raines?  And that jackal of all jackals Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt?  A tale told simply and with great performances by great and small is the one that will stand the test of time. And this film certainly does that!",10,1,1,25 November 2000
Battleship Potemkin," One of the All-Time Great Directors
","What would Eisenstein do today!  His films still pack tremendous wallop even 65 years later.  Yes, the baby carriage falling down the steps and the bullet in the eye still impact today, but the most telling image is the lock-step soldiers with rifles and bayonets at the ready, treading forcefully down the steps is an even greater image! Eisenstein's films are masterworks of double entendre for just as he silently condemns the czarist authorities, the irony that he portrays is that the communists are just as guilty.  I believe that his films deliberately show this irony as his way of damning all authoritarian/totalitarian regimes, and he got away with this in the USSR by doing precisely this. The characters in his films are not first-rate actors, but the images and faces of these characters are startling in their realism.  Watch the monk playing the organ in 'Alexander Nevsky' and you'll see what I mean. What a face!  And Eisenstein...what an artist of the first rank!",Null,1,2,10 February 2001
Pearl Harbor," Bora, Bora, Boringggggggggg
","This film deals with the sudden Japanese attack on a triangular love affair that wasted the first hour of film.  After seeing the people watching the planes come in to Pearl, Cuba Gooding doing an excellent Dorie Miller, the Oklahoma slowly going bottom up and taking many brave sailors with her, and the bomb landing in the main stack of the Arizona, there's not much left of this yawner to contemplate.  If you want to watch an exciting and historically accurate film about the attack on Pearl Harbor, then see Tora, Tora, Tora which has enough action in it that the attack sequences lasted almost as long as the actual attack did, December 7, 1941. The love interest is maudlin, and shallow and unnecessary.  It took up absolutely too much of the film, but was simplistic enough to appeal to the mindless bubble-gum crowd (as their reviews so overtly suggest). It is too bad that the people who put this turkey together don't have the talent to do a film that goes over the heads of the 16-17 age group to adults.  But then, maybe not enough adults go to the movies to make cerebral films profitable.",Null,0,0,2 June 2001
Gone with the Wind," A Timeless Classic
","Do I think this is the greatest movie ever made?  No, but it is in the top five.  The first half of the film is one of the most gripping of all time, but thereafter it drags on interminably. Had interest such as the first half been kept up for the second half, then I would say this is the greatest film ever made. Fleming never loses sight of the book. Mitchell's book is not a happy one, for the South or for the main characters.  Ashley Wilkes may be a brave soldier, but he is a weak vacillating man, never able to completely break away from Scarlett; Rhett Butler, never able to win Scarlett's love until it is too late for both of them, becomes a fleshy topor in the end. Much like the South under Reconstruction as the Cavaliers give way to the carpetbaggers.  Only after Melanie dies does Scarlett realize, as she sees Ashley for real, that she is free to love Rhett; as the South realizes it must adjust to a new paradigm. One of the most gripping scenes in all filmdom opens the door for the complete degradation of the south and its aristocratic cavaliers:  The scene in the Atlanta rail yards with the hundreds of wounded and dying men set against the tattered Confederate battle standard..what a scene! Despite the dragging part of Confederate post partum agonies, this is a film that one can see over and over again, especially the war scenes and the destruction of the only true aristocratic civilization this country has ever known. I have always wondered just what Margaret Mitchell thought of all this up to the time she stepped in front of the automobile that took her life.  A suicide?  we'll never know. So we are left with the book and the magnum opus of this film which will never see a sequel that will do the original even close to justice.",Null,0,0,10 February 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Brutality of War
","This film never stops to let one catch his breath! Except for the unnecessary love interest.  The scenery, the multitude of actors, the combat are all magnificent. For those who are buffs of WW2, they will not be put off by the fact that the real Vassily Zaitsev looked more like Bob Hoskins than Jude Law, or the real killing of Major Koenig was done because Zaitsev was more clever in hunting down Koenig than Koenig was hunting down Zaitsev [Zaitsev's fatal shot was into a darkened area of a building that he correctly surmised was where Koenig had to be.] That notwithstanding, the film was a gripping account of a handful of people caught up in what was probably the most horrific battle in recorded history. Ed Harris was fantastic in his understated role as the war-weary Major Koenig, made more stark by his pulling down the train window shades on the trainload of shattered German soldiers across from him, and the irony that these battered men were the real lucky ones: they were leaving the hell-hole of Stalingrad.  Bob Hoskins was brilliant as Nikita Kruschev and his energy carried the political suasion; the men who sent young men out into battle with the admonition that when the man in front of them was killed they were to pick up his rifle and carry on.  I do not think that in this stage of the war, the Russians were quite as willing to send out cannon fodder (ten Russians for each German)as they were at the outset of Barbarossa in June of 1941. But the battle scenes and the Russians shooting their own retreating soldiers, brought back for me the state of affairs that faced the Russians in June 1941, and the rude welcome surviving POWS got when they returned to Mother Russia after the war. The scenes in Stalingrad were as real as it got 59 years ago.  A fine film, despite a few problems. It affected my wife, who found it hard to sleep that night with the thought of the slaughter in a war that could have easily been prevented.",7,0,0,19 March 2001
V for Vendetta," Remember...no reason for this lousy plot.
","Remember, remember the fifth of November and no reason for this lousy plot..I'll say one thing for this turkey...it made me want to read the graphic novel to find out what really transpired. When driving on a wet road you look out for pot holes. With this movie you can't avoid the plot holes.I assume that if one accepts the movie's ending of the ending of the right-wing Christian dictatorship (what a crock that is...the last and only one was in Byzantium six centuries ago, and the thought of a 'Christian dictatorship coming to England, much less than to the United States, is silly)that those left on the ground, removing their masks (I guess to start picking the new anti-totalitarian atheist government)would somehow escape the anarchy that would ensue, assuming that the falling of Parliament would have a different effect from the toppling of the Twin Towers. What would happen would be the military stepping in to restore 'order.' I mean these people aren't going to go into lines to form a new government ('All you people who want to be the new High Chancellor please line up here.') Even The Shadow had people who helped him catch the bad guy.Our masked boy speaks in soft, sibilant tones to all he meets, and then dispatches them to the Hereafter bloodily, as with the the TV guy, or by lethal injection. And, while wanting to put the government out of our misery, doesn't mind some collateral damage along the way.The USA, is portrayed as a leper colony (why?) and later we see video of civil war in the Heartland. So why did the British need a Baptist dictator? The scene is one not at all removed from England today, people watching the telly, having drinks together..we even see families glued to their TV sets, and one scene that looks like a retirement home..but do these people give an indication of dissatisfaction with their lives? The movie doesn't indicate this. No, V is on his own here and can only resort to a string of assassinations and two glorious bombings. We never are taken into Parliament to see if that body is still deliberating; and if it was closed down by the dictator, why bomb it, other than the Guy Fawkes thing?It is obvious reading the comments from people who have read the novel that this movie and the book are not, to use a phrase...on the same page. It would not be beyond the realm of reason to have the masked populace show up and lynch V so they could go about their one passion, it seems, of watching dartboard contests in Huddersfield, and come and go as they please as long as they don't wander out after dark without their IDs.",4,3,8,3 April 2006
