Blade Runner 2049," A big movie
","Finally, a major motion picture for a change. There are very few films that get higher than a 7 out of 10 from me. Hence a rating of 8 indicates films that I highly recommend.The big challenge for film makers these days is that the production levels of TV have gone up so much that a lot of movies seem like just one big episode of a television show. There aren't many films that are able to impress the viewer with the feeling that they're watching a classic big motion picture. Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 succeeds in putting itself into the Motion Picture category. This is a film that takes you places and makes you think. The acting's nicely done and all homages to the original are subtle enough to come across as sophisticated instead of cheap. There are plenty of nice glory shots in here and the scenes take their time. They even allow the ends of scenes to linger for a while in order to immerse the viewer in the material. This is something that the director of The Empire Strikes Back highlights as an important technique and one that less experienced directors often forget to do. He should know, since he used to teach cinematography. You see this technique also used extensively by Tarkovsky (1972's Solaris). The editing is good and you get a lot for your money with a running time of almost three hours. The pacing is surprisingly well executed, considering the long duration of the movie. It uses a very interesting sequence of scenes ranging from medium to slow to fast to slow again. Seriously, there are meetings that film makers have just to figure out how to properly pace a film and what sequence to put the various intensities of scenes in. Topping this off is a sound track that is true to the original material and also calls back to the 1982 film's score. Nicely done. Something that certainly helps this movie feel enough like the original is the involvement of the director of the original (now in a producer role), one of the producers from the original movie, plus one of the two main writers from the 1982 feature. All of this pays off and is coupled nicely with the style of the new director (kudos to him for handling the material properly). In conclusion if you enjoyed the 1982 Blade Runner movie, then there's a very good chance that you'll like this one as well.",8,2,9,8 October 2017
Alien 3," Deserves a second look
","I originally reacted strongly against this film, and I think it's for the same reason that many fans of the series did at the time. Alien was a landmark film and was a certain type of genre. Then Aliens was released and proved to be a faster-paced and exciting thrill of a film. I enjoyed Aliens so much as an action-horror film that I must have watched it well over fifty times. So, you can imagine my surprise when I went to see Alien 3 in the theater, only to find out that the characters that everyone loved from Aliens were dead or dying. After re-watching Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 again and taking a good close look at the details, I realized that Alien 3 is actually a return to the tone, mood, and nightmarish terror of the first film. If fact, technically speaking, Alien 3 is more true to the series than Aliens is. I'll give Cameron credit for closely following the plot points set by Alien (awaken from sleep, discovery of organism, first encounter, outmatched by organism, hunter becomes the hunted through conduit system, seemingly kill organism, creature returns for an encore, finally kill creature, return to sleep, roll credits). Great, I get that. However, Aliens is an action film that takes a few liberties with the Aliens (introduces a queen and bulks up the formerly sleek alien design). It also initially leaves off the creature design credit for H.R. Giger. Now, we move forward to Alien 3. This film is dark, filled with suspense, features vast sets, and a creature that is more like the one in the first film than the one in the second. Characters are once again stripped of sophisticated weaponry and put into a situation where human must truly struggle against xenomorph. It's the sense of helplessness and hopelessness that is a hallmark of Alien films. Ripley's defiance in such situations is what defines Ripley's character. And it is this that show up in spades in the first and third films. As for the cartoonish fourth film, I barely acknowledge it (for a variety of reasons). So, those who were disappointed in Alien 3, I recommend that you at least give it one more look. First though, re-watch Alien and note the elements that make it what it is. Then keep in mind that -- in real life -- bad things happen to good people. Alien should be the stuff of nightmares.",8,8,9,6 January 2010
Chinatown," 'Forget it, Rick; It's 2019.'
","First off, this review uses parallelism between Chinatown and Blade Runner and includes spoilers for both films. As such, please stop reading if you do not want knowledge of important plot elements of either of these films. Chinatown is a film that sneaks up on you and punches you in the face at the end. But it does it in such a way that -- for a moment -- you're not even sure what happened. Nicholson, Dunaway, and Huston play their parts brilliantly. It's truly painful to watch Evelyn fall from such a stoic person to a nervous wreck. All the while, she keeps you guessing. In fact most of the characters of this film keep you guessing in an Agatha Christie sort of way. Who's good, who's bad, who's crazy? It keeps shifting on subtle levels. The cinematography is excellent. Nice smooth camera shots and composition. Restrained use of camera motion. Nice editing and a suitable score. The pacing is also really good. Fast enough to keep a person's interest, but slow enough to show the lush locations and buildings. The only case in which I'd subtract marks is for the Chinatown location itself. Once Chinatown is shown, it's presented fairly flat and lacking in visual detail. After watching this film, I couldn't help but think of Blade Runner. Now I see the connections between the two films. Blade Runner owes quite a bit to Chinatown. In particular, Rick Deckard's interaction with Rachel. I can also see why Jeter's truly awful and inconsistent novelized sequel to Blade Runner (The Edge of Human) made sexual abuse references in regards to Rachel. However, dealing with the sudden shock of discovering that you're not human serves the purpose effectively enough. Adding on a borrowed element from another film on top of that is totally unnecessary. The tone of Chinatown and the visual style of the era that it is set in forms the basis of Blade Runner's world. 1940s future-noir is the look, and the tone is equally serious. This 'tone' is something that a great deal of modern films seem to lack. Both films hold true to their tone and mood consistently while presenting a story that could be applied to various eras. Before beginning to think that one film is copying another, consider that most art forms derive elements from earlier works. There's no question that Chinatown owes quite a bit to 1946's The Big Sleep. And I'm sure it continues on back beyond that point in film and novels. The key is how it's done:In particular, if a writer or director has a new idea and is inspired by an existing film, then it's best if the new project be a unique world with new characters. In other words, not a sequel. In this case, Chinatown to Blade Runner. In cases such as this, scenes and characters can be similar. Even lines of dialogue can take on somewhat similar structure. However, if a sequel is to be shot then the rules change. The viewer is much more wary of sequels and prequels. Unfortunately, there has been a rash of sequels lately that recycle lines wholesale. To re-use general plot points is one thing (and to be done subtly -- if at all), but recycling lines is often the kiss of death for a sequel. Examples:Strong Sequels:Aliens: This film uses a plot structure that is very similar to that of Alien. However, it works because the two films are of different genres and the characters are unique enough between films. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: In this case, there was an imperative to take the film in a different direction from the first. Hence this film is very different from Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It represents a completely different story, totally different motivations, mood, and plot. The two films share little in common, except for the general universe in which they exist and the main cast of core characters. Ideally, this is how a sequel should be done. Note that it does remain consistent to the previously-established Star Trek universe. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back: Again, the film is unique from its predecessor. Furthermore, it falls into a slightly different sub-genre of film. The tone of Empire is much different than that of A New Hope and remains consistent throughout. Consistency is absolutely key to making any film a success. Hopefully modern directors can re-discover this concept. The screenplays are totally unique between the two films and there are no recycled lines of dialogue. I won't name sequels that are considered to be poorly done. I'm sure readers of IMDb reviews are well aware of many examples of sub-standard sequel and prequel films. Take a look at them closely and look for recycled lines, 'homage' scenes that are nearly carbon copies, blatantly re-used plot lines, weak and highly derivative stories, inconsistent treatment of firmly-established characters, and a lack of substance. All of this returns us to Chinatown. Here is a film that is packed with emotional substance. It's subtle yet strong. Chinatown owes its visual style and tone to the film noir era while presenting totally new material. The characters are multi-layered and difficult to strictly classify. It never tries too hard and there seem to be no absolutes in the film. And lastly -- and most importantly -- it ends exactly where it should. Perhaps the ending should be the starting point of any writer's work. It's what makes or breaks films with even the greatest level of potential.",7,0,2,15 July 2012
Iron Man 2," More than a superhero movie
","This is the first time I've ever written a review on a superhero movie. Essentially, it's because I have a hard time regarding movies of this genre to be serious film. However, this is one of the very few times that I can safely say that I've seen a movie that falls under this category that also serves as a genuinely polished work of cinema.Iron Man 2 is well worth seeing. It has replay value, deals with present-day issues, doesn't take itself too seriously, features exceptional performances, and deals with a very realistic lead character. This last point is the one that really makes or breaks this genre of film for me. Traditionally, I've found that Batman has come the closest to being a believable character, due to his flaws. Tony Stark, however, brings the level of realism to a higher level. He IS the contemporary man: conflicted, fallible, sometimes humerus, sometimes heroic, and (despite what he may believe) in need of the help of others from time to time.Kudos to the writers: This is a very smooth screenplay. Kudos to the actors: The performances are often subtle and always a joy to watch. Kudos to the VFX crew: There's nothing distracting about the effects. Good estimates on simulated mass and kinetics. Good light-matching. Oh, and kudos to the sound designers: The gunfire is remarkably well-mixed.If you haven't seen this film, check it out -- even if you don't quite think it's your thing. You'll be glad you did.",8,1,2,25 March 2011
Ready Player One," Still worth seeing, despite the changes
","Yes, there are a lot of changes from the book. Filmmakers have no choice in that regard, so this shouldn't be a surprise to savvy film-goers. Over all, I felt that most of the changes were pretty good. Some even handled scenes a bit better than the book did. I felt that the book made too big a deal about Aech being a black girl. Why would that be such a shock to Wade anyway? Thankfully, the film handled that better and just had him acknowledge right away that Helen is Aech, is his friend, they're in danger, and they'd better run -- quick!Certainly I was sad to see quite a few references disappear, including: Dungeons of Daggorath, all of the music by Rush, the Joust challenge, War Games references, etc.... At the same time, I completely understand the reasons for changing those references since -- lets face it -- how many people in the general public today even know what Dungeons of Daggorath is?Thankfully, most of the references that were 'removed' still appear here and there in the background for observant people to spot. It was nice to see a functioning ColecoVision in the scene near the end of the film. And there's a Rush poster on the wall in that same scene. There are people on IMDB whining about how the movie is packed full of pop culture. Well, here's news to those who haven't figured it out yet: The book and the film ARE pop culture. They're cans of pop culture that happen to have a label that reads, 'Ready Player One.' If you're expecting something other than that, then you're too confused to write a review that's relevant to the film.On a more technical note, this film is shot well, effects are quite good, and the pacing is pretty quick. The tasks that characters take on have changed a bit from the book. When Art3mis was captured, I was afraid that it was going to turn into a 'damsel in distress' cliche. However, her escape was more of an assist, with Samantha having the guts to take the risks required to shut down the shield (although that kind of 'borrows' from Star Wars part IV).The acting was good, with Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance both doing an exemplary job. And although he doesn't appear in the book, T.J. Miller's I-R0k turned out to be my favorite character. He helps make up for the omission of the Lich.Another fun addition is the segment from the Shining. I dare say their representation of The Shining is actually better than Kubrick's. They even went as far as to add a scene that Kubrick's film sadly left out. It was nice to see it included here, and was a subtle and clever way to reveal an aspect of Helen's character.For those who so wanted more of the build-up that the book had, consider that such a long arc would have been plodding and slow cinematically. That's just the way it works in film. I'm sure that would feed the flame of those reviewers that somehow found this film to be boring. How that's possible is beyond me. Perhaps there's a subset of the population that needs to stare at strobe lights 24/7 while listening to three soundtracks at the same time in order to be entertained. If that's the case, perhaps they should consider themselves to be outside the bell curve and keep their comments to their own clique..Sorrento was a bit of a departure from the character in the book -- to the point where he looked like he actually sympathized with Wade at the end of the film. This is something that I don't buy at all and feel that he should only have hesitated because the police were there and not out of any sense of morality or nostalgia. I also didn't really like the use of his first name so often in the film (since his first name is the same as Nolan Bushnell's and almost sounds like it's trying to frame Nolan as a video game villain whereas the real Nolan of video game pop culture was quite the opposite and someone that we can thank for helping build and shape the video game industry that gamers enjoy so much). So I suppose there's the good Nolan of the real world and the bad Nolan of the film.In contrast, the use of Ogden Morrow as the Curator was a clever touch and one that worked quite nicely. It still gets the quarter into the main character's possession and -- at the end of the day -- has the same effect as in the book.In conclusion, this is different from the book but still entertaining. It mixes 80s references with those of the 90s and today. In the process, it still caters to geek culture (which is what it's supposed to do). It's well-presented and keeps a decent pace. There are a few depictions of characters (like the head of IOI) that seem a bit off. However, it's close enough.",7,0,1,1 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I thought I quit Star Wars...
","After The Last Jedi and Solo, I actually quit Star Wars. I'd had it.Then my friends went to see The Rise of Skywalker and they were saying quite a few positive things about it. So I decided to finally go and see it.It seems that Abrams and his writing crew managed to salvage what seemed unsalvageable. Certainly, this film threw a few too many things into the mix (everything but the kitchen sink, as the saying goes). I could do with a little less 'cute creature' stuff and less line re-use. Aside from that -- and some over-the-top scenes featuring a charge on 'horseback' -- this film actually works.Those who have been following Star Wars since the beginning will notice references to the original concept art as well as scenes (like the end sequence) framed much like a Kurosawa film. Couple this with scenes that repair the damage done by Ruin and his crew and we have what represents a real effort to make up for lost time. Tight editing and a real effort by all the actors and this film actually takes on an epic feel.There are some familiar faces in this installment. When I saw the trailers, I figured they were just there as a last ditch effort to save the franchise. After seeing the film though, I see that they're more than just cameos and play a pivotal part in the plot. I really enjoyed seeing them in this series again (you know who I'm talking about).So a big thanks to everyone who worked on this and for finally giving the original fans something much more akin to episodes IV, V, and VI.",7,5,16,5 January 2020
Rush," The epitome of rivalry
","Since seeing Backdraft in 1991, I've been waiting for Ron Howard to return to something a bit more gritty. And with this film, he found just the right balance. Rush deftly captures the essence of rivalry. It also depicts an accurate look at the 1970s. I can relate to both since I was there in the 1970s and I've been through the intense rivalry that comes with steep competition with a group of adept people that face possible elimination. Without even trying, it's all too easy to be identified as someone's enemy. It's only when it's all over and done that you realize that your enemy wanted to be your friend.Right from the get-go, the cinematography and audio mix hit you. That was my first indication that this was a high-quality film. Then, after a while, it becomes apparent that the characters are really strong. There's a definite sense of authenticity to this film and the later races really get the blood going. I actually worried about the drivers and was 'hanging on the edge of my seat' as the old expression goes. Be sure to check this film out -- even if you're not really a fan of racing. It's also worthwhile to take a look at the documentary that accompanies it. Cheers.",8,0,0,28 March 2015
Oblivion," Talking' 'bout my generation
","** This review kind of contains spoilers **I watched this again recently and I liked it even more the second time. While I agree that this film isn't totally original, I really don't mind. Even the films that a number of people claim that this 'rips off' did the same thing themselves. Those films also lifted ideas from previous works (like Silent Running, which the director flat-out mentions in the production video). Perhaps people should be less concerned with originality and more with whether or not the film resonated with them. In this case, I'm even more willing to let some things slide since I see a huge influence here from Saberhagen's Berserker series of stories. I may actually be the first reviewer to mention this connection. If that's the case, there are a lot of people who really should go out and read more books. I'm happy to see anything that resembles his works on screen. This is also why I really enjoyed the end sequence for this film. Nicely done. The pacing of the film was fine. I can appreciate a film that takes its time. The look of the film was pretty cool too, in fact it reminds me of Syd Mead's American Steel paintings. The score was pretty good and had some really inventive elements. However, it was the sound design that really was remarkable -- especially for drones (very cool). It's rare that I see good sound design in modern films. Thankfully they spent the time to nail down those details. Acting was fine. I didn't see any glaring issues. It was suitable for the genre. Visual effects were mostly seamless. Again, nothing glaringly problematic. Cinematography was good, although not to the level of Geoffrey Unsworth or Jordan Cronenweth. To that end, this film feels more like a big episode of the Twilight Zone than like a massive epic film. Regardless, it's an enjoyable watch. If you approach this as a sci-fi short story that was adapted to the screen, you'll likely enjoy it (especially if you've read your share of 60s and 70s science fiction). I should mention that I'm the same age as and have a similar background to the director, so perhaps that's contributing to my affinity to this film.",7,0,1,7 August 2016
American History X," Pretty good. A few minor tweaks would make it even better.
","** This contains spoilers! **Edward Norton is frighteningly believable as a skinhead in this movie. In general, I thought the acting was good. This movie is kind of like The Shawshank Redemption -- except with less hair. It's well shot and edited. The pacing slows down a bit for the second half (which is pretty typical of most film plot arcs). However, it delivers the goods. One issue I had with this movie is that it borders on being a bit too soft in certain areas. For example, Derek's character changes a bit too quickly. I understand that there's limited time in a single film to explore a person's change of heart. To that end, having him not cry after he gets prison-raped would have been a better way to go. A guy that's actually that pis*ed off and aggressive would not cry in a situation like that. He'd be upset -- no doubt, but he wouldn't break like that. It would be more believable if he reacted like someone who was injured in a fight and genuinely insulted and even embarrassed (but not willing to show it). More stoic is what I'm thinking here. The crying should have only happened once in the film and that's at the end when his brother dies. That would give the death scene at the end even more weight. At the end of the day, Derek cares about his family and that's the secret to cracking his armor.",7,0,1,21 September 2016
Ex Machina," Google me Pink
","Unless you don't care about hearing important plot points before seeing this movie, do not read this review until you see the film.Alternate titles for this movie could have been 'Google me Pink' or 'My Ex-Machina'.At first viewing, I thought this movie was not bad. I wasn't really blown away by it. Certainly, I appreciated it more than the similar film, 'Her'. It's obvious that a lot of thought and effort went into Ex Machina. It wasn't until after a night of sleep that this one started to seep into my unconscious mind. I actually like this movie even more now than I did while initially watching it. The tone of the film is engaging, the cinematography is nicely done, and the CGI/composites are very good. Even the kinetic movements of the androids were carefully considered. Acting was good too, although the characters were a bit quirky. The story's treatment was along the lines of the more thoughtful 50s science fiction (reminiscent of the original Twilight Zone series).Quite a bit of dialog was dedicated to the topic of whether or not Ava could convince someone that she was sentient. IMHO, it was at the point that Ava easily convinced the helicopter pilot that she was human that she passed that test. And her abandoning Caleb was when she truly transcended from robot to pretty girl -- complete with archetypal ambition. Just as Nathan had mentioned, the A.I.s would have the humans figured out before long. Watch out world.Related works: Having a long-time interest in this sort of topic, I can recommend a few similar films, including Gene Roddenberry's 'The Questor Tapes' from 1974 and the more recent 'Automata' from 2014. Of course, for more of a campy take on this type of thing, there's always the enjoyable Fem-bot episodes of the 'Six Million Dollar Man' and 'The Bionic Woman' as well as the 1976 film 'Future World'.",7,2,3,16 March 2016
Jurassic World," Not bad. Not great either.
","I almost turned this film off during the first 20 minutes. The formulaic cotton-candy intro was a bit too much to stomach. Instead, I walked to the kitchen and grabbed some food. By the time I got back, the movie had started to gradually get on its feet.As it turns out, this is a film that gets better as it progresses toward the ending. There are a number of warm-and-fuzzy family moments where characters try to develop through talk. This would work better if it wasn't so obvious that this was the intention of these scenes. I guess if there's a word that describes this film, it's 'overt'.No surprises here. Pretty much what you'd expect from this series.On a hair and make-up note, I see that the same pink lipstick is being used on the men. To the departments and the manual that you're consulting for color codes, please be aware that WE CAN SEE THIS COLOR ON SCREEN. It's worth updating the color so that it isn't so obvious on both the big and small screen (unless the tranny look is what you're aiming for). This is the third high-budget film I've seen with this phenomenon.So yes, go ahead and watch this film if you liked the other Jurassic films. However, beware if you're into hard-core dinosaur films -- you might find this to be a bit fluffy.I enjoyed this more than the first Jurassic film. It's much better than the second movie. However, it's not as good as the third. So far, Jurassic Park 3 is the winner.",6,2,6,22 February 2016
Music and Lyrics," A fun, well-paced, and genuinely funny movie
","I really enjoyed this film. The writer clearly understands what its like to be a musician and the people who scored the 80s music did a great job of getting the sound just right. The casting was spot on and both Grant and Barrymore were the right people for the characters. I was also impressed by how Haley Bennett managed to switch from a hyper-sexualized character to one that is almost a-sexual and unreadable. I imagine that's also partly the result of the director's efforts on this film. If there's anything I know well, it's the 80s. It's never easy to get the feel of a past decade's music and style quite right. However, this film manages to nail it right on the head. Watching the behind the scenes material on the DVD, I can see that they referenced the right material in order to get the look and feel correct. Going overboard worked in their favour, since the New Wave era was pretty extreme -- to say the least. Finally, I have to say that I found myself laughing my head off. This really is a funny movie. Worth seeing, even if you're not really into romantic comedies.",8,1,2,3 January 2012
Prometheus," Meh!
","I'm a huge fan of Alien, liked Aliens, and despite originally not liking the third movie, I actually have grown to really like Alien 3. Prometheus had potential. But, like so many sequels and prequels nowadays, it's highly derivative, borrows situations and lines of dialogue from previous films, and is generally unimaginative. The editing was too fast. Yes, they did a nice job on the ship interiors. But they were in too much of a rush to keep the pace up. There were shots of the interior of the company ship that were nice but too quick. Just as you were beginning to take in the atmosphere, they cut to the next scene. The soundtrack was complete rubbish; It pulled me out of the film repeatedly. The supporting actors were awful, reminding me of the bad moments of the fourth film combined with pretty much all of Aliens vs Predator. What is it with childish over-acting in so many films of this genre these days. For characters, I felt that Vickers and the ship's captain were the two best. However, neither is really given the chance to fully develop in this film. As a fan of Alien (spoiler alert), I was pretty ticked off that the writers decided to change the ship's alien crew into humans. WTF!? Seriously, a group of ten-year-old children could come up with far more imaginative explanations of what the alien race was. So what if they biologically engineered humans. That doesn't mean that they themselves have to look like humans. Along with this particular gripe are the many seemingly random and unexplained scenes. One of the main characters of the film is infected with a 'virus' that makes him mutate slightly and wig out. Okay. Why? This along with a number of other short and definitely not sweet oddities make the film seem unfocused and scatterbrained. Finally, the lack of imagination of the presentation of the world that this series has tried to flesh out over the last number of decades is somewhat diffused by this film. It's ironic since the story actually attempts to broaden the Alien universe. Some things should never be explained, lest you ruin the mystique. So, I give it a good rating for visual effects and for SOME of the acting. I give it a thumbs down for the rest of the acting, the ripping off of elements from the first film, the crap soundtrack, and the general lack of tension. This movie has no real climax. Instead it has a bunch of half-baked mini-climaxes. Very unsatisfying. Hence the final rating of 'Meh!'Advice to Hollywood: Unless a stellar writer, amazing composer, and awesome director of photography signs on, cancel any and all Blade Runner sequels now.",5,8,15,11 June 2012
Her," Somewhat interesting, but not all that engaging
","This film has the feel of a low-budget feature that tries to look expensive. In general, the cinematography is solid. Audio tracks are good as well.Having said that, the actual portrayal of events and the believability of characters and situations leaves a bit to be desired. Most characters simply accept the relationships with Operating Systems all too easily. The main character seems to question the idea to some extent, yet most others around him just seem to accept it wholesale (aside from his ex).This film really just takes elements that already have been covered in sci-fi and re-packages them in an easy-to-digest manner. I'm not sure if that's really all for the best. The concept of AIs grouping together and evolving has already been covered by the series 'Ghost in the Shell'. And the relationship between human and AI was more thoroughly taken care of in David Gerrold's 1972 novel 'When HARLIE Was One'.If anyone asked me whether or not I'd refer this film, I'd spare them the cheesy phone-sex scenes of 'Her' and instead recommend they read Gerrold's book and consider watching GITS.If there's one thing that could have raised the tension in 'Her', it would have been to discuss the possibility of the OS software manufacturer extorting the users for more money in order to allow them continued access to their operating systems. That would have been interesting, not to mention more relevant to the modern world of downloadable content today.",6,2,2,11 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," Recycling and rail-jumping
","** Spoilers follow **What can I say that's good about this film? Well, the aspect ratio was good. And if you look at some of the shots as still-frames, they look well-composed. The lighting's good in most instances. And the ending is pretty neat. By that I mean the last ten minutes of the film. Now for the problems in this film. First and most obvious (to me anyway) is the camera that the DOP opted to use. I'm not sure if more than one spec of camera captured the material for this movie but there are quite a few shots that look like high-resolution home video. It appears to be a frame-rate issue (and no I wasn't watching it on one of those horrid high-frame-rate televisions). Note to future film-makers, please do tests to determine if you're getting a 'home video look' to your shots. And if so, find a way to avoid it (whether through a different camera selection or using some kind of film-look filter... or better yet, shooting on actual film). The next issue is the music. There are sections of score that call back to the score for the 1979 film. However, they're placed in scenes in which they just don't match up. Then there are new pieces of score that sound like excerpts from Star Trek Voyager. Either way, it doesn't suit the material here.Characters are the next item to address. Similar to Prometheus, there are miscellaneous crew characters that are both flat and borderline silly. In this motion picture, many of them conduct themselves in an unbelievably unprofessional manner. It puts me in mind of the conduct you'd expect from a bunch of campers in a budget slasher horror flick.Then there's the plot and the timeline -- neither of which make any sense in the context of the original 1979 feature. We know that the events of Prometheus take place around thirty years before the events of Alien. And we know that the events in Covenant take place from that time through to about twenty years prior to the events depicted in the 1979 film. However, it was clearly established that the Space Jockey in Alien had been in the chair long enough that it had fossilized. Its ribs were burst outwards and the familiar leathery large eggs were already in the ship. So we can already conclude that the eggs on the ship in Alien and the death of the Space Jockey had taken place thousands of years ago -- if not millions of years prior to the discovery of the ship by the crew of the Nostromo. The idea of David being the one who completed the development of the genetic engineering of the bio-weapon into the form of the Alien that we see in the 1979 motion picture is simply not possible considering the time-frame. Further complicating this is the concept of the facial structure and bulk of the Space Jockey being a suit worn by a large humanoid (as proposed in Prometheus). Again, this doesn't match up with the position of the ribs of the Space Jockey in Alien. I'm surprised that the writers didn't instead go with the concepts laid out in the Dark Horse graphic novels that followed the film Aliens.Even if we were to go with the idea that it is a large humanoid in a suit then we have to deal with some other questions raised by Covenant: If in fact they are such an advanced race, then how is it that they wouldn't include some form of authentication for vessels of their own that approach their home-world? How is it possible that their planetary defense system consists solely of a single shield? Where are the rest of their ships? For a space-faring race, how is it that ships from other worlds that they have very likely explored are not returning to investigate the crisis on their home-world? Are we to believe that no distress signal was ever sent from their home planet in response to being bombarded by their own bio-weapons? It just seems like the details weren't thoroughly thought out. And this seems to be a recurring problem in modern film-making -- especially when dealing with prequels and sequels.Next on the list is the use of recycled lines from other films (including Alien and Blade Runner). Now I'm not sure what secret screenplay writing manual instructs writers to recycle lines as some supposedly clever way to tie a new script into an existing one but I have news for whomever believes that. It doesn't work. Recycling lines is a sure-fire way to cheapen both the original film that's being referenced and the new film -- all in one go. It isn't clever and it comes across as juvenile.Creature design is another issue. Although I suspect that the idea of making monkey-aliens is supposed to suggest to the audience that there's a primitive stage right before the official Alien stage in the creature design, it unfortunately ends up looking ridiculous. The crazed little monkey-aliens running and jumping around are more comical than creepy and turn the scenes into something akin to slapstick.Finally, I have to mention the scenes that just don't seem to fit the tone of Alien. These include the flute-playing lessons and the aforementioned mini-alien antics in the wheat field. And if we go back to the previous film (Prometheus), there are the scenes that include the crew-member talking to a snake alien like it's a cute pet, the two guys howling in the hallways in an attempt to anthropomorphise their mapping spheres, and the very silly head exploding scene in the laboratory. Keeping consistency of tone is what's really hurt this series of films. It was very apparent starting with Alien Resurrection and carried right through to Covenant. It's unfortunate because a sophisticated and well-designed film like Alien really deserves better.",6,1,2,29 August 2018
The Island," A surprising return of solid science fiction storytelling
","Like many people, I took the trailer for The Island at face-value and assumed that this would be another mindless action flick. Michael Bay's name was on it, and he's not the first name that comes to mind when listing directors of cerebral films.However, after finally viewing this film, I feel that it deserved to do much better at the box offices than it did.The Island cleverly borrows elements from films like: THX-1138, Coma, Future World, Blade Runner, and Logan's Run. Although it does have its fair share of action sequences, it still manages to slip in messages about greed, morality, the possible future of cloning, and what people will do in order to survive. The treatment was exceptional, and it represents one of the few films that actually manages to modernize the classic 60s and 70s science-fiction story-telling style, without throwing away the substance or feel of that time-period's most notable sci-fi films. My only qualm with this picture is with the over-use of action scenes. There are a couple of sequences that are so over-the-top as to diminish the level of believability for this film. Cutting back on these scenes would have helped the movie's dramatic elements as well. Having seen The Island, I have no choice but to cast my vote for Michael Bay and the team that created this film to be the ones to make a motion picture version of The Bionic Man (6 Billion Dollar Man -- factoring in inflation?), if such a movie is ever slated for production.Do yourself a favor, and watch The Island. If you're a fan of classic sci-fi film, then this is one that you won't want to miss.",8,0,2,20 April 2007
