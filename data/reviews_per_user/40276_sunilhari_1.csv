The Legend of Bagger Vance," This was an allegory to Hindu mythology
","This movie was a straight-up allegory to the Bhagavad Gita, one of the major scriptures of Hinduism.  To give a too-brief summary, it is the teachings of Krishna (a Hindu god) to Arjuna (a warrior) on the battlefield.  Arjuna looks out and sees his cousins on the opposite side, about to fight him, and says he has lost the reason to fight.  Krishna shows him why he must fight.
Now, another name for Krishna is Bhagavan.  Say 'Bagger Vance' in a Southern manner (i.e. drop the r) and real quickly.  Sound familiar?  Also, Rannulph (what the hell kind of name is that?) Junuh - if you just use his first initial and last name, it becomes R. Junuh.  Hmmm...All in all, a pretty good allegory.",Null,1,3,17 August 2003
