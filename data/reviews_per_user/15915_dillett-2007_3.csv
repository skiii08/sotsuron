Black Swan," It's a core shaker.
","I believe that this film, with little hyperbole, is quite simply an exceptional piece of film-making. So I find it necessary that I marshal my words carefully to explain why I justify such an exuberant statement. It's very important to me. Upon viewing 'Black Swan' for the first time, the immediate observation was the striking resemblance to 'The Wrestler', most likely, if not undoubtedly, a companion piece. The opening prologue ignites a searing and visceral cinematic style that strides through the entire feature, much the same as in 'The Wrestler'. The whirling mix of music from Tchaikovsky to The Chemical Brothers, layered with a complex array of harrowing whispers, reversed laughters and bird noises. It generates an accomplished soundtrack that compels a melodramatic story to rise to the musics grandeur.And speaking of melodrama. The story. An unnerving tale of anxiety, rebellion and fear. The narrative is based on the frail 'wall-flower' and brand new prima ballerina, Nina (Portman) in the New York Ballet Company. Who's lead in the upcoming Swan Lake is challenged by the confident and sensual 'new girl' Lily (Kunis). As the opening production looms large in the mind of Nina we see her spiral into paranoia and strange occurrences start to invade her life, a tangible inter-winding symbolism questions what is real and what seems to be delusions of an unraveling mind.This dark and twisted narrative accompanied with such an emotive soundtrack could be overwhelming for a less experienced Director. But Darren's ability to create a visually breathtaking feature is unquestionable. A true feast for the eyes. The story and music seem to uproot and crystallize the mise-en-scene. The beautifully crafted choreography is captured in a lose, hand-held, style that accentuates the strength and skill required to perform in such a way. It becomes evident just how remarkable Natalie Portman's performance is. Her physical appearance exaggerates her haunted mentality, her willowy form is symbolic of her frailty to corruption by the Machiavellian rival Lily (Kunis), the obsessive Mother (Hershey) and the predatory Artistic Director of the Ballet, Thomas (Cassel).These antagonists shake Nina to the core during her pursuit to tread the thin line between her White and Black Swan. Metaphors for her oppression and ascendancy. The story twists, turns and crescendos throughout, and we eventually draw into a dramatic and fittingly poignant conclusion.Bravo.",10,2,5,18 August 2012
Ted," Finally a funny film since the 90's.
","This is the first time I've done a revue of a film on IMDb, but after watching Ted - I felt a sudden urge to praise such a charming, endearing and 'bark like a dog' funny movie. There are indeed so many times you can hear the phrase: 'I f**cked her with a parsnip' without wearing a crash helmet and walk out of the cinema with anything less than a mild concussion. One can't be blamed for expecting something 'Family Guy-esque' when the credit list reads off such names as Seth Mcfarland, Mila Kunis, Patrick Stewart...it goes on and on. I see no problem there. It's similar. Very much so. But good God, it's great. Them at their best. The bad language, the drug taking, the sex, the jokes and popular culture references. Moreover, you have a simple yet sweet story of growing up and moving on. Something that everyone can relate to. Is the story particularly profound or well told? No, but that's not the point. And if you think it is then - go read the Top 250 Films list one more time and lecture someone else on how you saw Memento and guessed the ending. - You didn't...nobody did. Trust me, in a 106 minute film. I laughed countless times. I honestly can't remember the last film (that was trying to be funny) that did that to me.",6,1,6,14 August 2012
Brave," A Brave yet disappointing effort, and I'm half Scottish.
","I'm certainly not the first and will not the last person to claim how much respect and love I have for Pixar. But I do. The earliest memory I have in cinema was watching my Mum marvel at the amazing CGI in 'Toy Story'. I was too young at the time to appreciate the remarkable mastery of Pixar's animation. But over the years and later films like the next two installments of 'Toy Story', 'Monsters Inc.', 'UP'...for me, growing up with Pixar's visual effects and quality story telling left and undoubted source of film inspiration. So I cannot be blamed for going to see 'Brave' with anything but high hopes, unfortunately Brave didn't quite meet them. One immediate comparison that draws to mind on what to expect is Dreamworks' 'How to train your Dragon', the Celtic imagery and story based on a young individual trying to find their calling and prove themselves. However, this is not a comparison that is necessarily a good one as I didn't care much for 'How to train your Dragon'. One thing that was certainly missing from Brave that is 'so-so' important in all of Dreamworks and Pixar films is the great friendships. Mike and Sulley, Woody and Buzz, Ginger and Rocky, Shrek and Donkey, Marlin and Dory, Wall-e and Eve... these great friendships are the reason why we love these characters. When we see them meet, when they fight, mock each other, make up and sometimes say goodbye. Throughout 'Brave' I was dying for another 'great character' someone who will allow us to get to know Merida (protagonist) and shake her to the core, changing her permanently. I flatly cannot remember another characters name and I feel that nothing was learn't, nobody truly discovered something profound or worth the whopping budget of a Pixar feature film. Maybe I'm being harsh - their are some real highlights. The witty one- liners, clever observations, slap-stick comedy and real 'tongue-in- cheek' moments. Billy Connolly, is as always, a real pro. His pounding 'Glasgow brood' makes a welcome addition to the seemingly unending whining and whinging on behalf of Merida and her nagging Mother. The animation itself is remarkable. Some of the shots of Merida riding horseback through the highland countryside are breathtaking, her hair itself, with layers and layers of texture is almost a character in itself. But when it comes to animation 'making' a film what it is, I'm afraid the horse has well and truly jumped the gate. I think a time before 'UP'and 'Toy Story 3' existed that would have been enough. But 'Brave' as it is, is bravely walking with giants and needs to compare: both visually and narratively. I'm left deflated by 'Brave' - as I'm writing this I'm realizing this more and more. I'm recalling the chills I still have when I saw that immortal ending to 'Toy Story' and the visceral battles in 'The Incredibles'. All that is left is to wonder, who is this for? Is the comedy, story- telling and references enough for adults, perhaps not. Is the story magical enough for children - possibly. But on all accounts, for me, I'd rather delve into the old Pixar DVD collection.",5,0,3,18 August 2012
