Black Swan," Many good points
","This movie can express unique world in dancers well.Nina dances as real ballerina.We can find Natalie's great effort in it.Her life in detail was also as a ballerina.All dancers desire to be principal.The desire is always insane. The Insanity sometimes bring people death.Many ballet story deals with same death.It is a very interesting theme. Her mother expect Nina to be principal and she found Nina her doll.Nina needed outgrow mom's dependence.It was one of the highlight of this story.Nina grows her personality through her training SWAN LAKE, she became to be able to play BLACK SWAN.The last dance was very powerful and impressive.",Null,2,5,19 January 2011
