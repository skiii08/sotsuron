The Avengers," Being a fan, non applicable.
","As far as marvel movies have gone in the past, their history is eh.. sketchy, at best!

Personally I believe everyone likes a well made 'buddy action' movie, and this is exactly that. The marvel universe has made this feature (in my mind) essentially perfect. Containing, mild feel good humour, riviting story line, well played roles by well loved actors, absolutely mind blowing special effects, and a jaw dropping goosebump inducing sense of nostalgia that links you directly to your youth irregardless of age or interest in the comic books themselves! Put it this way folks. Your kids will ADORE IT, and you will also.",9,1,1,12 April 2018

In saying that you would not be disappointed as you have the pinpoint perfection of the dialouge, and the breathtaking (hand picked by Tarantino himself by the way) soundtrack. Tarantinos magnificent work is also overflowing with classic scenes, and full of endlessly quoteable lines. Look at the big brain on brad
