The Blair Witch Project," The most terrifying movie of all time, instant classic.
","I was lucky enough to see this film in limited release. I can't explain the emotion that I felt while watching it. I was so scared that I was shaking by the end of the movie. All I know is that if a movie in it's simple, basic form, like the Blair Witch Project can frighten me so thoroughly, then I don't think that any movie with it's scary soundtrack and reeling special effects will ever come close to what The Blair Witch Project is. This film is destined to become one of the greatest horror films ever made.",Null,1,2,30 July 1999
