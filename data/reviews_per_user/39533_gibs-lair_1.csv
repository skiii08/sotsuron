The Avengers," Awesome!!
","I saw this movie today and was a bit confused as to how they would fit all stars in the storyline. I would say...wow!!!...they did an awesome job. A unique movie I've seen were all heroes get placed just perfectly. Excellent story, amazing action and graphics (not overdone but just right), and keeps you at the edge from the start till end. I would recommend this to all, but don't watch this in 3D. The director has done his best to capture the true characteristics of each marvel hero, especially hulk!. Humor has its place in the movie with unbeatable action. I gave ten for this.Long time since I saw such great direction in a super-hero movie.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
