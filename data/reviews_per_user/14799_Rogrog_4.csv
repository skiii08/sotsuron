Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It could have been worse....
","But not much worse, as this movie is totally lacking in plot and good acting, with several minor exceptions (Liam Neeson for one).  What annoys me most is the reliance on special effects to hide the fact that there is no plot cohesion whatsoever, the characters simply talk for a while, have an action scene, then go somewhere else to talk and then have an action scene. Another feature that is most aggravating is the fact that the lead villain and my favorite character, Darth Maul, gets all of three one sentence lines and about five minutes of screen time.  Although I'm a fan of the original series and have read most of the books, I must say that this movie has the worst plot ever to be associated with the Star Wars franchise.Overall I give it  a 3 of 10.",3,0,1,7 August 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Great movie, that's all there is to it.
","This movie is truly magnificent in that it succeeds on so many levels, sure there's plenty of action and adventure, but I find that my favorite parts are the ones which feature comedic elements (SPOILERS: my favorite is when Indy's faced with the Arab guy who shows off with all these fancy moves, and Indy just takes out his pistol and pops a cap in him).  There is not much else that can be said about this movie, except that it is a definate must see for people of all ages.Overall, I give it a 9 of 10 (no movie is perfect, but this comes close)",9,0,0,7 August 2000
Fight Club," A contradiction on many levels.
","To be honest, I'm not sure what to make of this film, I can't seem to make up my mind is it something truly unique, or just a rehashing of a series of good  ideas put together.  The film itself starts out interestingly enough, yet slows down toward the middle and end, until the final 15 minutes, which runs at a frantic rate (which it should, to illustrate the lead characters revelations about himself).  I'm not sure what kind of people to recommend this movie to, it doesn't in my mind belong to any preset genre, and I there fore find it hard to compare to anything.  Overall, I believe I enjoyed the experience of watching this film, though I am hesitant to say on what grounds.The ending alone warrants a good review, and thus I give it 8 of 10.",7,0,2,7 August 2000
The Patriot," I don't see what the big fuss about this movie is.
","Its true that this movie incorrectly depicts both sides of the conflict unjustly, and that the British were not the evil monsters they are made out to be (although a number of atrocities were comited during the war, by both sides whenever it furthered their goals.  Personally, I don't care about the historical accuracy in this film, I go to the local cinema for entertainment purposes only.  As such, I consider this movie to be fairly entertaining, with a few good scenes (especially the beginning) and a few awful scenes (most notably the ridiculous fight in the end).  I do recommend this movie to people who like action movies, but definitely not to history buffs or people who don't understand the underlying premise that it's only a movie, and should be taken as such.Overall a fairly good 2.5 hours of film. I give it a 7.",9,0,1,3 August 2000
