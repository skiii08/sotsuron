First Man," Screenplay ruined this movie
","This movie has two stories. However, they are not aligned or merged into one. The storyline to the moon is paper thin. In the movie, Armstrong was just be there but provided no participation. There is no story line for all supporting actors. They just like a walking full size paper cut dolls. Their lines did nothing to the story. You cannot remember who they are and what they had done with Armstrong and this story line occupy 3/4 of the story in the movie.
The second story is the love story between Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong. There are issues between these two persons who they love each other. The director put a lot close up on Gosling and Foy to express the tension between them. However, the story did not give them the room to express or carry the story. We all know that they bear the pain from the lose child but they never converse or transform. The story also did not tell us the impact to two remaining kids from their tension. The family has no dynamic among them. They are just 4 people living under one roof. What a shame.",3,0,0,19 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars redo
","Heard so many rave reviews about the new Star Wars movie, watched it tonight and totally disappointed. Well, the fans of the original Star Wars would love it because this is just a redo the original one. I agree with the Audioguys review. JJ paraphrase the original one. You can defend for him to pay tribute to the original SW - New Hope but it just sadly and shamelessly copied the original one. Rey is a scavenger, same as Skywalker. Han Solo went to the bar in the original movie, same here. Princess Lea put the message in R2D2. Now, Poa put it in BB8. The droid took the message to find the Skywalker and lead to Skywalker in the new film. Some of the lines are even carbon copied it. This new SW definitely make tons of money. All I hope JJ will make a more original SW movie in next chapter.",2,11,22,21 December 2015
