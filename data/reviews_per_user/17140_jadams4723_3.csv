Despicable Me 2," Fantastic!!
","This is a family Friendly movie that is really good, it was very funny, kids of all ages will enjoy this film! Gru is now a dad and has no trouble handling the kids its not like the first Gru we saw in the first movie stealing the moon and being a crappy father now he is a stay at home dad making Jelly and Jams. I Evan heard many adults laughing including me the only reason I rated this 9/10 is because the first movie was better so If you need a movie to see parents go see despicable Me 2 you will not be sorry! So it Was a very good movie I loved it and so will you well that will do it for me for Movie USA I am Alex Adams (Find us on FACEBOOK AT MOVIE USA",9,0,1,8 July 2013
The Avengers," bravo bravo!!!!!
","The Avengers is a smash! This movie was very well written and was action packed the entire movie (no kidding)!!!! It had very little profanity and no blood except for the part where Loki, Thor's brother takes somebody's eye out with his staff. It does not show up close view but anyway I would tell all my friends about this film! Don't take kids under 7 to see it just for the action part of it! I will make this promise, if you see it you will love it!!! If you do not love it, sorry movies are not your thing! Also a shout out to Robert Downey, Jr.( aka. Iron man) he did great! But the mightiest Avenger is THE HULK (DON'T MESS With HIM) I know I wouldn't!! Marvel you did it again very great movie!!!! Thanks for reading. I am Alex Adams for Movie USA!!",10,4,9,1 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," 3s a crowd??
","Don't get me wrong, this movie was good. It still made me laugh a lot! The only thing was it did not beat out the first two Madagascars, but it still had a great storyline and a great bad guy which are the things I like!! The cute and cuddly penguins are also back and kicking butt. If it wasn't for them,Alex and friends would be dead. So enough talking,let me tell you about the film (and no, there is no spoiler!) After Alex try to leave Africa and fails, the team goes to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. Then they join the circus and thats all I am going to tell you. You can find out what happens when you go see it. Just because I gave this movie a seven because some parts where slow does not mean you can not go and see it!!! Hey we are all different. Who knows ,you all may love it. There is only one way to find out. Go and see it then write a review. I mean this movie was not a bad movie like 'Surfs Up'- now that was an epic failure! This movie has no profanity. Not even a little like omg or anything. This was a good clean family movie that everyone can see. I will just say if Dreamworks is going to make a fourth one make it epic!!! For Movie USA, I am Alex Adams. Thanks for reading.",7,2,3,8 June 2012
