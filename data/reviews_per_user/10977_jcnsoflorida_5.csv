Black Swan," Best Zeitgeist Picture of 2010
","There are those who malign BS as trashy and hysterical, and it's hard to argue that it isn't. But if you can see past that, this film taps into the here and now like few others. (The Social Network, of course, is a Zeitgeist movie, and a good one). Specifically, BS is rendered almost exclusively from Nina's point of view, and she is basically living in a pressure cooker. That said, I think viewers often think films with artistic pretensions have to be taken seriously at all times. Not really. Often, art films are 'saved' by flashes of humor. And BS is a fairly rare hybrid of an art film that is highly commercial as well. Few films since the late 60s are as on point in the art/commercial sense as BS. Many are the films that have tried for the Rosemary's Baby thing. Finally, the Polanski award goes to ... Aronofsky.",8,0,3,15 December 2011
Marie Antoinette," Pretty Missundaztood
","There are valid reasons for panning this movie, but one should at least give director Sofia Coppola credit for essentially creating the film she intended to. This is a highly skewed biopic, but Coppola made choices, which we don't have to agree with, of course, but they were hers to make. The film ends quite a bit before MA's beheading, and it is an understatement to say it is not much interested in politics. One might detect a bit of directorial slackness going on here (personally, gliding over the issue of her children's paternity was a bit much for me), but Coppola clearly knew what she was doing and not doing. One of the things she seems bent on exploring is how much she can get away with. It turns out, quite a bit. While that may seem like a rather immature stance, it is artistically defensible. She is mainly interested in sound and vision, and this film pleases the senses in fascinating ways. I think the soundtrack is sublime. Will we ever get an undisputed masterpiece from Sofia Coppola? We might get a great film, but I would not expect everyone to like it.",7,0,1,22 March 2007
Dreamgirls," Fine Acting All Around
","Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy are receiving well-deserved awards but allow me to sing the praises of the other major actors in this movie. Jamie Foxx plays a soft-spoken sonuvabitch, and it's time we see him do sonuvabitch. His soft-spokenness is a little bit scary, as we witness his rise to the top as a pop music producer. Anika Noni Rose is not a household name but she undoubtedly will be. And while we're supposed to feel miffed that Deena took over for Jennifer, Deena's becoming a star is exciting anyway. Seeing Beyonce emerge from her restraint in the first half of the picture is one of this movie's sublime pleasures, even as we are forced to confront the complications. Beyonce evokes Miss Ross though not in a dragqueeny way that a lesser performer might have resorted to. This deserves to win ensemble awards.",8,1,4,17 January 2007
Across the Universe," Moulin Rouge Meets the Late 60s: Very Different and Fun
","The late Sixties was a complicated time. This film's strengths and weakness mirror the complexity of that period's highly-charged issues, many of which are still unresolved. I'm not sure if director Taymor intended that or not, but in any case, the film is uneven. You're bound to like some scenes/numbers better than others. (My favorites: I Want You (She's So Heavy) and Strawberry Fields.) However, if you're curious, I would say go and see it, mainly because it's imaginative and entertaining (and the music's good too). A bonus: the film is adept at drawing contemporary parallels. You'll wonder: When is THIS war gonna end???",7,5,12,15 September 2007
Rosemary's Baby," Tannis Anyone?
","Movies were constantly raising the bar for shocking in the late Sixties but few succeeded like this one. It was one of the last films officially 'Condemned' by the Catholic Legion of Decency. The dream sequences were easily the best of their time and continue to hold up well. Polanski's delight in the medium is palpable throughout but it never distracts from the narrative. The movie's texture --sophisticated Manhattan, but attainable-- resonates beautifully in the Christmas season scenes and later, when the temperature rises and Rosemary fumbles in a public phone booth. Note the gay friends at Ro and Guy's party. All the actors are in top form. Mia Farrow, lovely and vulnerable but crucially believable. Cassavettes as an ambitious actor, young but his biological clock is ticking. Did the Catholic Church get it right? This exemplifies the subversive power of cinema.",9,1,2,20 March 2007
