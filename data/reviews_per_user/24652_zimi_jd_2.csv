It," Don't DO 'IT'
","I never write reviews, just rate the movies at IMDb. But I watched IT yesterday and am here, trying to help everyone here and save some money on this ridiculous, Lil to no sense movie. I literally have no words. I mean this movie tried really hard to creep you out and scare but OMG, they did it in the worst way. Understand this. This movie made me come to IMDb and write this whole review. And I am super lazy to do all this. The only word that comes to my mind while thinking of this movie is Dumb. Sorry, but this movie was just BAD. I wish I could go back in time and not watch this movie.Just trying to help people, save money and save time.",1,33,72,10 September 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Great movie, but Infinity Wars was way better!
","The title says it all. Plus this movie had toooo manyy flaws, which I am totally willing to ignore. Which movie does not?But clearly they should have at least taken some more time and get their stories in sync and correct.",7,2,13,29 April 2019
