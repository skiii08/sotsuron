Sucker Punch," Magnificent!!
","A visual masterpiece, good statement, I enjoyed it immensely. Zack Snyder probably have made one for the ages for all film fans. Wery seldom I feel so excited about a film that I after it, go online to check what other people felt about it. Once upon a time in America, Valhalla rising, In Bruges, Seven psychopaths, Fitzcarraldo, comes to mind. What this guy does, Peter Jackson only DREAMS of doing:-) Spielberg is not fitted to polish Snyders shoes! Hehe! Be kind to people that hates this movie, they do not know what they have done/seen. Emily Browning is as always stunning. If in doubt about her, watch 'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' If you like this movie, watch Watchmen.",10,3,9,16 February 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A work only of duty
","Sadly, we see this more and more often: An okay premise, pi..ed away. The movie is from start to end a mishmash of good acted moments, piled together like all your favorite spices, and then blended together in a porridge that is just not good for anything.The overall storyline is usable for a 1st act, maybe..It baffles me, when amazing actors like Woody, says yes to something like this. They have contracts of course, but they are not slaves.I could have watched three episodes of Star Trek instead of this, and remained a richer person.Stay away, wait for the final act and then FF this turd.",1,21,39,21 January 2014
