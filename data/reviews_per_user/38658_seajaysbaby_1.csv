Black Swan," Waste of Time
","This was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. My boyfriend and I made jokes through the whole thing. Nina looks like she is going to cry throughout the whole movie and when she actually did, we cheered.What it really boils down to is that sex sells. If I wanted to see lesbian sex, I would watch a porno. That's not what I wanted though. I wanted to see a 'Masterpiece.' Apparently, it was known the film was going to be terrible so they threw that in to get attention. Nina is weak and fragile and it's almost exhausting watching her. Highly overrated.",1,11,19,29 April 2011
