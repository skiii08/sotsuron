The Avengers," Medium, Spiderman is missing
","This movie was very average, nice effects and soundI expected more, Thor was good looking, Captain America is nice but what are his powers exactlyIronman was nice, better than Ironman 3 which came out after this movie.The actor who played the Hulk is a miss cast.Spiderman is missing in this movie in my opinion.Black Widow is good lookingLoki is a boring villainDC probably see this movie and can make it better with Justice Leauge.",5,4,9,27 August 2015
