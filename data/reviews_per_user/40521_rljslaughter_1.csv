Come and See," frighteningly truthful and terrifying
","'Come and See' is a frighteningly truthful film about war and the horrors that take place in it. This film is not extremely graphic on screen but in your mind. The most terrifying things that happen in this movie, are left up to the viewer to imagine. This, I think, is an amazing way to get into the audience's head and under their skin. You do not see the people burning in the barn, you just see the barn burning. Yet we were just in the barn, and even though we escaped with Florya (the main character) your heart is still racing because you feel as if you were in the barn with the rest of the people. You can't smell a movie, yet you gag at the revolting stench of the swamp or dolls in Florya's house. Your not a character, yet you are scared for your life at the sight of the pile of bodies, you feel amazingly luckily not to be blown to bits by a mine. You've only meet the German minutes before (and you my think of yourself as a decent human being a would never do anything the Nazis did) but you clench your teeth, praying to see them burn to death, and you are almost broken hearted when they aren't. You don't just watch this film or listen to it, you don't even just live it. You survive it. You thank you luck stars that you are still physically in on piece.",9,1,1,16 June 2009
