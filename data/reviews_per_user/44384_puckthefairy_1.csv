Requiem for a Dream," Four characters dragged through the highs and lows of addiction
","After a few months of my boyfriend pestering me to watch this movie that apparently disturbed him to a point of drinking brandy i submitted and prepared to watch a movie i was convinced was probably not going to move me in the same way.An hour and a half, four fantastic character portrayals and one of the most horrifying endings to appear in film later and i can definitely say i was wrong. This film does not make you cry bucket loads and sob like twenty-something single women at a chick flick because it is a whole different ball game. The few tears making tracks down my cheeks were purely due to me being very sad and yet too stunned to cry very hard.This film doesn't just show you how it is to become addicted and slowly fall into madness, it grabs you and puts you next to the characters as they go to extremes to get the next high. This film is a prime example of how the camera can be used in the most effective of ways and how films that are based on characters and acting skills are never going to be shadowed by films fuelled by massive sets and millions of dollars of special effects.You have to see this film.",10,1,2,6 March 2005
