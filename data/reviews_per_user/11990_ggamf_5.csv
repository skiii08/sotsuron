Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Liked the movie - Hated Jar Jar
","I have to say that although I liked the movie, it was neither as good nor as bad as I had heard. I liked it for the most part, but if I could have taken a little eraser and canceled the character of Jar Jar Binks, I would have enjoyed it more.First off, his character's speech reminded me way too much of the character Prissy in GONE WITH THE WIND, offensive and annoying both then and now.  There was no point to his existence other than comic relief, and the problem was, the people I was with didn't find him funny.On the other hand, the effects were amazing, and the Pod-race scene and the 'sword' fight with Darth Maul were spectacular. The underwater scene also blew me away.I thought Jake Lloyd did a fine job as Annakin Skywalker, I merely took his character to be somewhat reserved (as a slave might be) rather than his acting as wooden. I thought the same of Natalie Portman. However, I thought Ewan McGregor was a poor choice for the role of Obi Wan.Overall, the movie was fun but had it's flaws.",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
Forrest Gump," Best Picture? Not really.
","I find it interesting that this picture won an Oscar over Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption, BOTH of which were better movies, in my opinion.I also find it interesting that Robin Wright as Jenny wasn't nominated, when I thought her performance was one of the GOOD things about the movie. She seemed to be the only person involved with the film the Academy ignored that year.The movie wasn't terrible, but it was too long, overly sentimental and not especially memorable. I did think Tom Hanks delivered a fine performance, but I don't know if I'd term it a 'Best Actor' caliber performance either.Basically, an overrated, over-hyped movie.",7,1,3,24 November 1998
The Princess Bride," Classic. Hilarious. Perfect.
","This movie was so perfect. Funny, but willing to make fun of itself. Romantic but not sappy. Perfectly timed, well acted, well written. Everyone I know loved it. Half the people I know spew quotes from it from time to time. What more could you want?",10,1,2,23 November 1998
Pretty Woman," DVD extras a special treat
","I liked this movie enough to buy it on DVD even though I already owned the video. I'm really glad I did - the extras on DVD, especially Gary Marshall's interesting commentary and the extra scenes cut from the original release make the DVD a real treat for anyone who loves this movie.",Null,0,0,6 May 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Simply perfect.
","I was so surprised and glad to see this movie as high as it is on this site's list.  It is one of my favorite movies and so many people missed out on it because of GUMP, which I personally feel is an inferior movie.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give incredibly moving and restrained performances that moved me to tears more than once. The direction and timing were flawless, and the story itself inspirational. It is so nice to see a Stephen King movie done right for once.This is simply a wonderful movie, worth watching over and over again.",10,0,0,24 November 1998
