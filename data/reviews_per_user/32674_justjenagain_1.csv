The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Feel Good Movie
","I thought this was an amazing movie. :') I laughed, cried, laughed some more, looked away, cried some more, my best friend and I were terrified at times, knowing full well what was coming....oh, it was perfect! It played out on screen exactly as it looked in my head while I was reading it and re-reading it. Been a Twihard since 2009 and I must admit, my passion for this romance couldn't be stronger.**LIL SPOILER** The music/soundtrack is what hit home for me. Thank you so much for bringing us back to the original 'Twilight' movie. :') What an amazing touch. You could have introduced something newer, more hip, more mind-blowing, etc...but instead.... it all just came full circle for me. Cannot wait to own this movie and see Part 2.",9,5,13,20 November 2011
