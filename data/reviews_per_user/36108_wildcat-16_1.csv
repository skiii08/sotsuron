The Blair Witch Project," dismal and predictable
","I specifically went out of my way to steer clear of any information about the movie before I saw it.  It had achieved such an incredible following and I wanted to view it as so many others had done; I wanted to jump at every little surprise.  Unfortunately, there were no surprises.  The only thing scary about this movie is that there are actually people out there that found it frightening.  I was so looking forward to see a movie that dealt with the depths of terror.  Fright has never had anything to do with cgi graphics; but the fear of the unknown.  Alas, I will have to wait for another movie to reach this plateau, for to understand the basic premise of the movie is to have already seen it.  Blair Witch was sorely lacking the frightening punch that so many had promised.",3,0,2,3 August 1999
