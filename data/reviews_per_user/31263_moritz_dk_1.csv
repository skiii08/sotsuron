The Blair Witch Project," original... but still crappy
","I saw this movie today for the first time. I had heard alot of negative response on it, so i havent seen it before now, and i must really say there is something about the negative oppinions. The only real positive thing I can say about BWP is that its one of the most original movies for years, but that doesnt help it making the worse movie i have seen this year. You could all point perfect acting, scary effect, theme, recording etc. IMHO it was just really boring, and i didnt feel the least scared at all. All the movie was about was some young kids getting lost in a forest and arguing about wheater or not they should record it.... Sounds fun? It aint... my rating 1/10, sorry for the bad spelling btw 8)",5,0,2,6 November 2002
