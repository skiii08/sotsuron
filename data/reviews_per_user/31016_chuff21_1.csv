The Incredible Hulk," Did not meet expectations, but still OK
","Maybe my expectations were too high, but after seeing Iron Man I had high hopes for this movie. First the not so great: The dialog for the most part is poor, and does nothing for the movie but fill time. I don't know if intended to have any comic relief moments, but I don't remember laughing once. Between fighting and chase scenes, it was kind of boring. There is really no suspense, and my heart rate didn't get going above normal once. There is also a couple cheesy 'King Kong' moments with the Hulk rescuing his love (Liv Tyler) and bringing her to a secluded location where they share some special alone time...while he's still in Hulk form. Lame, but short lived. While the dialog was poor, you weren't sitting there telling yourself how dumb it was either; it just didn't add anything to the movie. That being said, the movie wasn't terrible either. Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner. The visual effects are done very well, and while somewhat predictable, the fight scenes are fun and entertaining. There are also some subtle references to other Marvel material/movies. The movie did flow well, and while some of the scenes were boring, they did not last long enough to the point you actually felt bored with the movie. All in all it was a decent movie, and I'd give it 6.5/10 if this rating system could do half stars.***Please keep in mind when you read the really good reviews on here that most of them posted prior to the actual release of the movie, and don't really match up with most of the reviews after the release date. Any negative comments are only made after the release date as well. Coincidence? If just kind of makes me wonder who's posting these early reviews and if they are accurate reviews, or just stuff to boost this movies overall review rating and to get people to go see the movie.",6,4,8,14 June 2008
