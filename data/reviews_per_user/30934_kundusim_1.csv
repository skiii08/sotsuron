The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk Wasn't So Incredible
","I'm not going to claim that this movie was awful. It wasn't. I'll admit that the first time I saw it I was entertained, the second time even, but that doesn't make it a good movie. The film was only held up by special effects. Not story, and not acting by any means. Now, I would never call Edward Norton or Tim Roth horrible actorsâ€”even William Hurt, and Liv Tyler (whose work I am not a huge fan of) were decent, though I do prefer Sam Elliot and Jennifer Connelly, but that doesn't mean any of them were good actors in this movie. I appreciate their performances, especially as replacements for a sequel, but there was only so much they could do with the story they were given. Honestly, the best acting in the whole movie was when Edward Norton and Liv Tyler wanted to get freaky, but he can't get 'too excited' and Liv Tyler gives him that perfect 'it's okay' line that every embarrassed man has gotten from a woman at least once.The fact is, the story was bad. It didn't go anywhere or do anything except set up and knock-down a random villain and show Bruce gaining some semblance of control over the Hulk in preparation for a third movie that will never happen because this one lost over $15 million at the box office. And in my opinion, the huge issue with these Marvel origin story movies is that the first ends up being too much exposition, and the second ends up being just action-based fan service with nary a leg to stand on. Maybe it is asking too much to see a half action, half well-written exposition superhero movie, but that is what we need. Some have come close, but ultimately, I feel these movies leave us with at least a small sense of disappointment, and that fault lies with the story. The actors give it their best, but they don't stand much of a chance.",7,0,0,31 January 2011
