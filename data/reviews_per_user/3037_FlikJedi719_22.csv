Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ages better with time
","If you asked me 5 years ago what I thought about the prequel trilogy I might have had a harsher opinion. However, after rewatching them recently and now having seen the full Skywalker Saga, I would say the prequels hold up a little better than I originally thought, though not much.The CONS: The entire movie is practically a political showdown. Because of this it can be a little hard to follow at times. Jar Jar Binks is in this movie (nuff said). Young Anakin's dialogue is terrible - in fact, most of the movies dialogue is not that good. And despite the summary of this review, the CGI in this movie, however, does not age better in time. The effects are not that good.The PROS: Understanding this is Darth Vaders origin story is kind of cool, especially if you are a die hard Star Wars fan. You can watch this movie and appreciate it for what it is. Also, watching Palpatine (Emperor) manipulate people is a common theme for his character all the way to the end. Understanding this, it was neat watching him at the beginning, and seeing how he turned the Republic into the Empire. He really is a genius. A few other cool things in this movie are: Qui Gon, Obi Wan, the Jedi Council, and of course Darth Maul.If you're a fan, you will probably appreciate this movie better than casual Star Wars movie goers. Also, seeing all 9 films really helps gain appreciation for the prequel movies even if The Phantom Menace is practically all about politics.Episode 1 gets a 6/10.",6,3,5,3 January 2020
John Wick," Non stop action
",This is a fun action movie. Keanu Reeves is a force to be reckoned with as John Wick. The fight choreography landed most of the time. Definitely not a dull moment in this flick.John Wick gets a 8/10,8,1,2,22 March 2020
X-Men," The start of something special
","Hugh Jackman made the X-Men franchise, and it all started here. Many might say this movie doesn't hold up well with time, especially with the backdrop of the Infinity Saga now alive. However, I'd disagree with that. Before The Avengers first suited up, before Captain America and Iron Man, came Marvel's first notable movie (to my knowledge): X-Men.The movie definitely doesn't compare to the performance, tone, and general excitement and anticipation of the aforementioned movies, but that doesn't make it any less fun. It clearly should be viewed, and rated, on its own merits absent comparison to the more successful superhero movies of recent times. I still remember the excitement surrounding this movie when I was a kid in 2000 upon its release.And because of that I give X-Men a 8/10.",8,2,2,10 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Rancor, Sarlacc, and Ewoks.. Oh my...
","This movie is a good conclusion to the original trilogy, but I'd rank it the least of the original 3. We get to finally see Luke settle in to his confidence as a Jedi Knight starting off by showing his Force chops against Jabba and his crew. However, the film lacks the charisma the first two had, and the scenes on Endor are sometimes a bit too cheeky.Darth Vader and the Emperor demand our attention in every scene. We also really see the power of the Dark side in action through the Emperor and his manipulating tactics. This is true Star Wars, and while some things feel off it is a solid conclusion to a masterpiece trilogy.Final grade: 9/10",9,2,3,3 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 'Force'-d & rushed
","This film felt forced and rushed, and I blame TLJ for that. It is clear throughout the movie Abrams is trying to course correct the issues from TLJ, and for the most part he did the best with what he had. I went in not expecting much, and admittedly it is better than TLJ. The film also does a good job throwing bones in an effort to tickle the nostalgia feathers of the Star Wars I loved as a child, but don't expect much more. These efforts are clearly just fan service - almost an apology for screwing up the franchise.As stated, the movie felt extremely rushed. It almost feels like the original cut is a 4 hour movie trimmed down significantly because the characters jump around way too much and way too fast. It definitely could have been paced better, but again not something I'd blame Abrams for. It's unfortunate this was the last in the sequel trilogy as it seems like this story could have been separated into two films and paced a lot better. Also, after hearing rumors Disney cut a lot from this movie Abrams intended to be included gives me a little heartburn - it is just rumors though so maybe that's not true. Ultimately, is what it is.I suppose the most disappointing fact is that this ending is all more of the same. While I love the Emperor, I left realizing that the true villain in all 3 Star Wars trilogies is always Palpatine. He is the master of being the man behind the curtain. There was nothing new here; it is just another Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith moment. The Emperor is always the main villain as he's the one always calling all the shots. I love Palpatine just thought this trilogy was going in another, new direction.Final grade overall: 6/10. Better than the last, but not as good as The Force Awakens, and the sequel trilogy as a whole is not as good as the original trilogy, imo.",6,5,10,2 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clones is ... ok
","Episode II is just ok. It is not Empire Strikes Back, but it is not The Last Jedi either, in my own opinion. The reason I rated The Last Jedi so low is mostly because of how the movie portrayed Luke Skywalker, but I digress... Attack of the Clones is middle of the road here.The CGI in this movie is not good, and the dialogue is especially terrible between Anakin and Padme. Their romance is too cheeky, and kind of awkward to watch at times. Anakin is also over the top whiny, but I suppose that goes with the development of his character as he inches closer to the Dark Side.The saving point of this movie is the fact that it does a great job pacing and developing Anakin while showing why and how he becomes Vader. Count Dooku is introduced in this movie too, but I wish we got to see a little more out of him. The final showdown is a neat battle as well.While this is not a great movie by any means it is definitely the worst of the prequel trilogy. Episode II is a 5/10 for me.",5,3,4,3 January 2020
The Revenant," Great acting; great cinematography
","Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are amazing in this movie. I've seen some hate that Leo's performance was overrated because he didn't have many lines and mostly just grunted and moaned throughout the movie. On surface, I could understand that perspective. But acting should be evaluated beyond dialogue. Leo's non verbal acting is on point. And Tom Hardy once again showcases his acting chops.
The cinematography deserves recognition as well. The shots and camera work in this movie deserve a ton of credit as well.I'm late to the game on this movie, but The Revenant is easily a 10/10.",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Aladdin," The cartoon is much better
","I think Will Smith and the Genie got a lot of extra hate in this movie. Was it weird? Yes. But not nearly as bad as Jafar, or I'd argue even Jasmine. Will Smith in this movie was nowhere near as bad as Jafar. Jafar was just unconvincing as an antagonist. Honestly, Naomi Scott as Jasmine wasn't that great either and her solo song was odd and felt misplaced. The movie wasn't necessarily terrible, in my opinion, but the movie was not representative of the cartoon I remember as a child. It honestly just felt like a cash grab by Disney.Aladdin gets a 4/10.",4,2,3,10 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the Luke Skywalker you're looking for
","This film disappointed me. I feel like Luke's legacy is destroyed in this movie. It doesn't feel like it's Luke Skywalker and even Mark Hamill has commented to this as well.For example, the first scene Luke is in picks up where Force Awakens left off. Rey gives him the lightsaber that was once his fathers, then passed down to him by Obi Wan. This same lightsaber he lost after Vader cut off his arm in Episode V, which he probably thought he'd never see it again. You'd think this might be sentimental to him. Instead his reaction: throwing it over his shoulder down a cliff??Then he doesn't even really get an honorable death either imo, but I will say the force projection fight with Kylo was cool. And what about Phasma? Seems like a waste of a character. Thought Phasma would play a more pivotal role after Force Awakens.The tone of this movie just feels off. Not my favorite in the Skywalker saga. Could've been better and as a result this movie negatively impacts the tone, pacing, and character development in the Rise of Skywalker. For that the movie gets a generous 5.",5,11,21,2 January 2020
Jurassic World," Welcome to Jurassic Park
","You really don't have to watch this movie to know what's gonna happen. And while it is exciting simply based on the source material the movie is almost identical to Jurassic Park. They even have the same characters but different names.Claire is John Hammond. She even wears white the whole movie.
You have the two kids who need someone to save them
You have Dennis working in the control room
And Chris Pratt is the Dino expert aka Dr. Grant.It's a fun movie, don't get me wrong, but it is Jurassic Park. They try to spice it up here and there but feel like the execution feels forced in an effort to make it stand apart. Not sure it really works.Jurassic World gets a 6/10",6,1,1,30 May 2020
The Dark Knight," Best Batman movie of all time
",This is the best Batman movie of all time. And in case you've lived under a rock for the last 10 years most of that credit goes to Heath Ledger and his iconic performance as the Clown Prince of Crime.,10,1,2,3 January 2020
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Great sequel
",This is one of the few times the sequel is better than the original. A classic Christmas movie. The house traps at the end are much better than the first movie too. And who doesn't love Harry and Marv?Final grade: 9/10 ya filthy animal,9,6,6,3 January 2020
Joker," Dark take on the Joker
","There is no doubt Phoenix's acting chops are on display in this movie. However, the tone of the movie was a bit dark for my taste. I can't discredit the movie for that because the Joker is in and of itself a dark character (if you're being true to modern comics). The comparison to Ledger; however, is apples to oranges. They both portray the character excellently, but if I had to pick I would prefer Ledger's take especially considering the tone of this movie. Still a great story, great acting, and great directing, but not one I would take my kids to see.Final grade: 7/10",7,2,4,2 January 2020
It Chapter Two," 'It''s Ok
","Chapter 2 is an 'ok' movie. The first one is much better. The adult actors do a great job playing off their child portrayals especially Ritchie, Eddie, and Ben. James McAvoy is great as always too. The scares just weren't there though. It was borderline cheesy at moments, but still ok. It was fun seeing the story wrap up, but the movie was too long almost not worth it.Ironic that Bill's endings sucked in the movie yet the movies ending wasn't great either.It Chapter 2 gets a very generous 5/10.",5,1,3,30 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Definitely the best of the prequels
","As far as the prequels are concerned, Revenge of the Sith is by far the best. This is a great climax to an ok trilogy. Palpatine's turn into the Emperor and Anakin's character evolution by far make this movie what it is. The battle between Anakin and Obi Wan, while a little long, holds up relatively well too. The dialogue in some spots are still a little cheeky, but it can be overlooked in this movie more so than in Attack of the Clones.If you are a fan, I believe you will enjoy this movie as you watch Anakin transition into Darth Vader while also gaining some history and insight into the Star Wars universe. If you are not a fan, I still think this movie is enjoyable as you see the origin of one of cinema's most popular villains develop and unfold right before your eyes.The movie ends leading straight into A New Hope fairly well. You understand why Obi Wan seems to be the only Jedi left in A New Hope, and you also get to see how Luke/Leia ended up where they did and why.Episode III is an 8/10 for me.",8,7,7,3 January 2020
Arrival," The art of storytelling
","'I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time', Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use 'the weapon'.There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.Easily a 10/10",10,48,50,19 March 2020
X2: X-Men United," Better display of powers than the first
","I really enjoyed the first movie, but X2 definitely does a better job at showcasing the mutants powers and abilities. The plot of this movie was well executed too.X2 = 9/10",9,1,1,13 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens is a reboot of A New Hope
","The Force Awakens is the best of the sequel trilogy, in my opinion. This doesn't take away from the fact that this movie is essentially A New Hope reboot...There are several similarities between the two movies (Planet killing weapon, a legend dies, desert dweller becomes jedi, etc.) that made the film feel oddly familiar.While the movie is not necessarily 'bad' per se, it is the mess of the next two movies that tarnish the trilogy. By judging this movie on its own merits, The Force Awakens is a fun adventure movie, it just lacks originality. I still enjoyed it just recognized that it kinda felt like a familiar movie.And for that, the film gets a 8/10.",8,4,15,3 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The start to an epic adventure
","A New Hope will forever go down in history as the start of one of the greatest cinematic adventures of all time. This movie is everything - from characters, to character development, to the introduction of John Williams' famous score, to crafting a great conflict between the protagonist and antagonist.The character development of Luke Skywalker in this movie alone shows nothing less than great storytelling. At the start of this movie, Luke just wanted to go to the 'Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!', and by the end of the movie he's using the force to help destroy the greatest weapon of all time: 'That's no moon. It's a space station.'While I was not alive in 1977, I can only imagine the audiences reaction after seeing this gem of a film. It has lived on from generation to generation, and still generates awe inspiring wonder from a story told 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....'Final grade: Easily a 9/10",9,3,3,2 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the original trilogy
","Empire Strikes Back is by far the best of the original trilogy. I'm sure there were plot twists before 1980, but this movie has to go down in history as the best and biggest plot twist ever with just 3 words: 'I'm your father'.Everything about this movie is better than A New Hope (and A New Hope was a 9/10 for me) including: the lightsaber battle, the special effects (which still hold up to an extent to this day), Yoda, a deeper dive into the universe through character and creature introductions, and of course more of Darth Vader. The lines quoted by Yoda throughout his sequenes are some of the best known movie quotes of all time as well. John Williams continues to deliver with his score and character themes too. This movie is just a classic and absolutely my favorite movie out of all 9.Final grade: Absolutely a 10/10",10,2,2,3 January 2020
Jurassic Park," A classic
","This movie was such an integral part of my childhood. There are quotes in this movie that were repeated in my house as a child, and to this day I still find myself occasionally saying things like 'must go faster', 'hold onto your butts', and 'you didn't say the magic word'.This movie is a timeless classic, and the effects still live up today. And of course you have to give a shout out to John Williams' fantastic score in the movie as well. There's nothing I can think about that's bad in this movie. Love every character, love the dialogue, and love the dinosaurs. What a great story, and a great movie.Jurassic Park absolutely gets a 10/10",10,2,2,4 January 2020
