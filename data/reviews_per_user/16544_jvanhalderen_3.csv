Mission: Impossible III," Utter crap
","Do not waste your time on this movie. If you have seen part 1, you have seen it all. This part contains nothing new, same stunts, same one-liners same stupid action hero. Actually the only thing I liked about this movie was Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the mastermind criminal with no conscience.This movie is way too americanized, but what can you expect from freaks like Tom Cruise. Don't waste your time on this!Thank you Tom Cruise for making Hollywood movies even worse than what they were.",4,5,9,2 October 2006
Contact," Brilliant!
","Contact may well be the only sci-fi movie that tries to make it as realistic as possible. No cliche action hollywood sci-fi crap, but a good story thats tells how our first contact COULD be like. Another plus to this movie is the aspect to religion, which most similar sf-movies leave out. An excellent movie and good performance by J. Foster and M. McConaughey.",9,0,2,30 October 2003
Contact," One of the Sci-fi's which is pretty realistic.
","The thing that makes this movie so great, is that it so (for a sci-fi) pretty realistic. The reaction of the world is nicely put, as it can be expected in real life. They did have to explain the technology a little better.",9,0,2,9 September 2002
