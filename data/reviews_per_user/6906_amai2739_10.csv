Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3*****
","A new director takes on the reign to the Iron Man franchise, Shane Black. Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2 but not on par with the first Iron Man. The film is a little darker and more serious than its predecessors but not by much. Entertaining adventure, some cool action sequences, with some surprises, let's get right to the surprises. 1 of the notable twist was Ben Kingsley's supposedly role of The Mandarin, wasn't really The Mandarin, he was just an actor with substance-abuse hired by the real villain to fake it. Ben Kingsley's talents were wasted. As a long time, comic book fan, I've gotta say, that was truly a disappointing twist in the movie, disgusted by it. And that's that.",5,2,3,27 January 2017
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2****
","Iron Man 2, the follow-up to the first one is a step down for director Jon Favearu. Honestly, I find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action sequences, like say, the part where Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark/Iron Man faces Mickey Rourke's Ivan Vanko/Whiplash for the first time on the race track, and Tony Stark needed to be equip his new Iron Man Mark V suit, so he dons his armor that was made man- portable in the form of a suitcase. That was a very cool action scene. Overall, I also find it that there was no character development or maturing & flawed at times. Didn't feel new or refreshing. Iron Man 2 was just a popcorn flick.",4,0,0,27 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad******
","The third installment into the DCEU, David Ayer's Suicide Squad, I enjoyed it. Of course the movie was far from perfect, but what film is? The story line to me was fairly straight forward, but all the actors brought their A+ game. Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn, I love Margot Robbie's & Jared Leto's dynamic when they share the screen together. What of Jared Leto's Joker? I personally thought he was good, along the line of Mark Hamill's Joker. Elements of Brian Azzerello's & Lee Bermejo's Joker. Did he blow me away like Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight? Unfortunately, he didn't but to me that's due to him not having enough screen time to shine, but that's understandable, considering he's not apart of the Suicide Squad in the comics, only meant to be apart of Harley Quinn's story. Definitely has room to improve though & I love that duo though. Will Smith is Will Smith, he was great as Deadshot. Viola Davis from How to Get Away with Murder plays Amander Waller who's the one responsible for forming Task Force X, she nailed that role to the bone. I think the surprises, wild cards, were Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang, & Jay Hernandez's Diablo, definitely. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc & Karen Fukuhara's Katana to me was cool but only served more as action set pieces. A lot of reviewers said Cara Delevingne didn't shine as Enchantress, I actually kind of liked her role more than expected. The movie was actually a little bit of a tearjerker, had some moments. Overall as I said, I did enjoyed it, it was actually a fun movie. I'd also like to point out that David Ayer did a great job of choosing the music for the movie, props to him, and the score by Steven Price was absolutely great too.",6,0,1,27 January 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier********
","Taking over the director's chair for the Captain America franchise is the Russo Brothers (Anthony Russo & Joe Russo), they did not disappoint, it was a step up from Captain America: The First Avenger, and I was a fan of the first movie. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a smart and an engaging film. A more realistic take, reducing the work of CGI to a degree in favor of some retro action. The story was suspenseful and I've gotta say, good character development as well. Chris Evans does a great job at playing the role of a good friend trying to save a good friend. Also I was very impressed with Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/Winter Solider, along with everyone else, they did a solid job. If this is the direction, the series is headed, I'm all for it.",8,0,1,27 January 2017
Man of Steel," Man Of Steel********
","Zack Snyder's Man of Steel to me was absolutely what we deserve of the hero. If Superman was to exist in the real world, this is how I'd imagine it to be. How the world would react. The story, the visual, and the action choreography (The action sequences were 1 of the best for a superhero movie I've seen). I remember when some fans would complain that Superman was a boring character because not anyone can take him on, so the director had him take on General Zod & kneel before him. Henry Cavill is my favorite Superman to date, he nailed it, he played the role perfectly. There were some things about the movie that I felt will cause controversy among fans but I didn't mind it, I thought within context of the story, it all made sense. My favorite Superman movie.",8,2,3,27 January 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Captain Ameria: Civil War*******
","The Russo Brothers' Captain America: Civil War was a very good film. I do believe that the title adapted from the critically acclaimed graphic novel written by Mark Millar, did not suit it. I felt that an adaption of this title could've have better been saved for another movie, truly felt wasted. In general, I thought the movie was solid but somewhat of a let down, not on the same level and excitement that Captain America: The Winter Soldier gave me but a great effort nonetheless. And honestly, this feels more like an Avengers 2.5 movie rather than a Captain America 3 movie. My favorite things about the movie are Chris Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America as always he does a great job, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther, and Tom Hollad's Peter Parker/Spider-Man. 1 of my least favorite things were Robert Downey Jr.'s character development had taken a toll. As I stated, it was a good film, a step down from the last, but good.",7,2,4,27 January 2017
Logan," Logan********
","James Mangold's Logan, the third installment to the Wolverine franchise goes out with a bang for Hugh Jackman's last outing as the titled character. I thought this movie was great, very well written, and loving the cinematography, the feel of it. Lets talk about characters, Hugh Jackman as an older Logan to me was done greatly, so was Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, their dynamic was fun to watch, like father and son. Also, absolutely love Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney/X-23, she didn't speak for most of the movie, but did a darn great job every time on screen. Also enjoyed the dynamic between her character and Logan, would have liked a little more to the father/daughter relationship, but it was good nonetheless. There were somethings I wish could've been different, but a very solid film. Some other actors I thought that deserve praise Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, both did great jobs. Overall, great R rated superhero film, western vibe, drama driven, brutal action. Also to me, the best of the Wolverine movies.",8,1,4,3 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman*********
","Had a chance to see Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman advance screening courtesy of Warner Bros. It may be my favorite DCEU film to date. An absolutely WONDER-ful movie, great edition to the DC extended universe. Gal Gadot is perfect as Wonder Woman, I loved her in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Love her even more after this. She and Chris Pine also had excellent chemistry, enjoyed all of their scenes together. When it ended, I was left wanting more. I also believe that this movie, Wonder Woman will inspire hope and optimism to her viewers. Overall, great movie, the pace was also fast, keeps you on edge and excited. No spoilers, but everyone should definitely go see it, truly worth it.",9,164,368,26 May 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice*********
","If you were a fan of Zack Snyder's Man of Steel then you will definitely like this movie but this can be a controversial film to non- comic book fans or with mainstream fans, especially with this version of Batman. This version of him is very similar to Frank Miller's Batman from The Dark Knight Returns, an older & war-weary Batman. Overall, I love the film. To me, the story was masterful, dialogues were great (thanks to Chris Terrio), the visuals was absolutely stunning, and the Easter eggs was awesome. By the way Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman stole the show, she was astounding. Ben Affleck's performance is superb, to me, he is the BEST batman to date.",9,2,3,25 January 2017
Deadpool," Deadpool*******
","Ryan Reynolds was made for Deadpool, he is Deadpool. You've gotta give him praise for his performance as the character, then again I feel like he's just playing himself. The movie was a fast, funny, and fourth wall breaking. It was a straight forward and entertaining movie, you'd get a kick out of this, nonetheless. I enjoyed the chemistry Ryan Reynold's Wade Wilson/Deadpool & Morena Baccarin's Vanessa had, loved every scene when they're together. Only problem I had was the character is constantly trying to tell jokes during moments where it wasn't needed, which in my opinion, kills the flow. As a long time comic book fan, I understand Deadpool's character but that obviously isn't my cup of tea. Overall, a very good film. Director Tim Miller to me deserves a lot of credit too.",7,0,2,27 January 2017
