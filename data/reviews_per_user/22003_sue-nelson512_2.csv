Source Code," Great movie!
","Definitely owes a debt to a 1962 B&W short film from France..La Jetee Although only 28 minutes in length and totally told by a narrator, La Jetee contains most of the same story elements of this strong follow-up. Time travel, apocalyptic events, the future saving the past, a love story with someone met in the past...Obviously Source Code is much more detailed and a much longer, meatier story, but both movies share a great sense of relevance to their respective times.I loved all the performances in Source Code. It's easy to like Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan but the supporting cast is equally good. Vera Farmiga is intense. Jeffrey Wright, as always, is totally immersed in his character, and if you can't call to mind a bunch of his performances, that to me is a sign of how good he is at letting his characters through.",Null,0,1,24 May 2011
The Mist," Teacher should know better
","While I really like this movie, there are a couple of things which bug me. 
1. The minute David says Billy is still hot presumably from a stress-induced fever, Amanda says she'll get him some aspirin. No child with a fever should be given aspirin. There is a link between administration of aspirin and Reyes Syndrome in kids. A teacher should know this...2. The whole scene of the mother trying to get home to her kids. Admirable, but why does she think it's incumbent on the men to help her and escort her home. Meh, just an annoying scene.3. David does not really adequately explain to Ollie and the others about the noise he heard in the loading dock area. But a good explanation might have shut down that part of the story. Nevermind!",Null,0,1,25 February 2018
