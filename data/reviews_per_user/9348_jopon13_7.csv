Requiem for a Dream," the realest unreal movie you'll ever see
","Youre on a different plain of existance while watching Darren Aronofski's Requiem for ad dream. Instead of the usuall review, I'm going ot list 5 reasons why this is easilly one of the best art house films ever made.1. The acting is supperb2. The cinematography is amazing3. The direction will blow your mind4. The film has the power to mannipulate emotions and force anyone to cry5. Goddam! this is an all around amazing experience, with an intangible feeling brought on by the drama",Null,1,1,21 October 2000
Romeo + Juliet," This is cool
","When i first saw this movie i didn't think it would be any good at all being that Leonardo DeCaprio was in it. Than i saw the first scene. I was blown away, and i kept watching. This is a great movie, a very good adaptation  of possibly the greatest play ever written. Baz Luhrman reminds me of Andy Warhol with his direction, and John Leguizamo is a great Tybalt. The action is great, and so is the acting.8 out 10",Null,0,1,15 October 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," not my usual movie, but i loved it any way
","I hate teen movies. But I've seen this ten times, don't ask me why, maybe because it's really shakespeare, don't ask me. Anyway, this is a terrific movie for those who have a more skeptical view of the world, and of course those who love a good laugh- i love them white rastas!",Null,0,0,2 November 2000
The Exorcist," Its hard to call this a horror movie
","In my experiences, horror films aren't scary, so that's why i don't call this a horror film, because it's terrifying!The exorcist seems so real, which is rather strange considering how bizare it is. The emotions displayed in the film are what make it so good. A girl has been acting very strangely, masturbating with a crucifix, floating in the air, and turning green, so when her desperate mother who is tired of seeing her daughter medicated and spinal tapped, she gets a priest/psychiatrist who is questioning his faith/sanity. The young priest finds another priest who has done an exorcism before, and than a fight against satan ensueths.9 out of 10",Null,0,2,30 September 2000
A Clockwork Orange," An amazing film on so many levels
","This is an awesome film, just awesome. The film is just warped and surreal, but at the same time beleivable, since It would be nice if the old ultraviolence didn't exist, so we would love to see a cure, but then the film deals with the issue that people are who they are, and if they're bad people, so be it, they're humans, not lab rats. The way the film is shot is amazing and the acting is superb, i can't find one fault, this is definitely one of Kubric's best!",Null,0,0,30 October 2000
Pulp Fiction," 4 stories, saidomascesism, a tasty burger, an o.d, a boxer,and a rude awakening
","In Quentin Tarentino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, the story of two hit men, a strugling boxer, a feared and reveared crime boss and two diner robbers, we see what a great director can do.This is a great film, on parr with Pink Flamingoes and train spotting, and very entertaining. Anyone who enjoys a fun, but at some times twisted good time, should check this out.",Null,0,0,18 September 2000
