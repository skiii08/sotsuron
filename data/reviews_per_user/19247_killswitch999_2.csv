Resident Evil: Afterlife," Great movie despite not following the resident evil game series
","This movie was great. I grew up playing resident evil and its my favorite video game franchise. With that being said, the resident evil movies do not follow the game very closely, but they honor the game by including its most memorable characters, and making them look bad ass on screen. A lot of people hated resident evil afterlife, because it didn't follow the resident evil games story lines, but there's something I think people should realize: the movies aren't trying to follow the games story. In my opinion the resident evil movies are made in honor of the games, kind of serving as spin offs of the original resident evil story, while containing memorable events and characters from the story. The resident evil afterlife movie takes place after extinction, in a world devoured by death and infested with zombies. Alice from the previous resident evils is trying to find some sort of life and does find some survivors of the apocalypse, in L.A. While Alice and the other characters including Claire and Chris Redfield(characters from the game series) are trying to hold up in a broken down building surrounded by zombies, all hell breaks loose and the survivors are forced to flee underground in an attempt to escape. After escaping the ravaged city, they travel by boat to a larger boat called Arcadia, which is supposed to be a save haven for survivors of the zombie apocalypse. The movie is very entertaining throughout and contains my favorite resident evil character Albert Wesker, who is the main antagonist in this movie. At the end of the day this movie is a classic for me because I love resident evil, and I would recommend this movie to any fan of the series who can put up with a change in the original story line, but who loves some of the main characters of the franchise such as Albert Wesker.",8,1,4,21 April 2011

","Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors, but this movie was just so BORING! The main premise of this movie is Nicolas cage playing a gun runner who sells guns to ANY group of guys of wants guns. Problem is I cant remember most of the scenes because it was such a boring movie.Ethan Hawke is also in this movie and is HIGHLY underused throughout. The few scenes with Ethan Hawke are actually the best parts of the movie.Nic Cage is narrating the movie and nothing to exciting happens for the bulk of the film. I have nothing more to say about this movie... 3/10 just because its a Nic Cage movie... Otherwise 0/10. Don't SEE IT",3,1,5,21 April 2011
