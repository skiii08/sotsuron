","This movie should not have been released. What happened was that some guy quit Disney, joined Dreamworks, and quickly scrounged up a lame movie to introduce to children. Unfortunately, this is not made for children. It has inappropriate language, lame story, weird animation, and Woody Allan. Sure people say that this is made for older audiences if not for younger, but I hate to say it, we don't like this either! Although A Bug's Life is less likely and more impossible, it is also more enjoyable to a family. People like to watch cute blue characters make their own world, not some ugly things with a bad attitude. Next time there's a kids movie... try not to include a man who married his adopted daughter 50 years younger than him...",5,3,6,5 February 2006
Independence Day," Best Special Effects
","Let me say this, 'This movie has some of the best special effects seen so far on television!' It's up there with Jurassic Park, Batman Begins, Lord of the Rings. Like, the ships had perfect graphics. Like, Revenge of the Sith had some pretty fake graphics, and it was 9 years later than ID4. Not to mention that the movie had a great cast of characters in in. Jeff Goldbloom is cool, along with Will Smith. Some people say this movie is overrated, I actually think it's way underrated. I'd bump it up 2 extra stars, if I could. I loved this movie as a little kinderg√§rtner, and I love it as a high schooler. It's up there with Jurassic Park and all of em' no doubt.",10,0,1,16 January 2006
The Dark Knight," The Best Movie In Years
","I just returned from viewing The Dark Knight with my sister and her German boyfriend. Quite frankly, this movie was absolutely enticing and exhilarating to watch. The acting was amazing by all the actors involved and Heath Ledger did indeed, earn his own posthumous Oscar. The storyline was not straightforward like Batman Begins, but left the audience behind and made us catch up with the plot. When the film ended, every person in the theater gave it an ovation and screamed with appreciation. This is very unusual, especially in my own town which is not in the center of the media-fed United States. This review is not meant for spoilers, but to tell what type of attention it will garner. If you are into light and happy tales, then Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are the films for you! If you are into serious and exhilarating superhero films, then this will be you magnum opus.10/10 from me!",10,4,9,18 July 2008
30 Days of Night," Greatest Bomb of All Time
","Greetings, Internet Movie Database. This was the greatest atrocity in film history. I know a bunch of horror movie fanatics will definitely pledge support to this catastrophe, but I, a former resident of Barrow, Alaska know better. First of all, that was not Barrow, that was not even remotely close to Barrow. In fact, it seems as though it were filmed in the middle of Canadian territory. The setting seemed to match a Canadian outpost, the buildings had the wrong design, there is no pipeline in or around Barrow, there were no real Inupiaq peoples in the film, the real sheriff of Barrow is obese and African-American, planes can land for that time that the sun does not shine, there is no diner and people's greatest problem in Barrow is the threat of each other. After that long list, I can evaluate on another problem. It seemed that the budget was minimal. The actors had plastic fangs and the violence was overdone. The scare factor was made by under-achievers who had music leading up to the 'SCARY PARTS'. All in all, this was the only movie that I have left halfway through and I am sure that I am not alone. Please, rate my comment of the usefulness.",1,5,16,20 November 2007
