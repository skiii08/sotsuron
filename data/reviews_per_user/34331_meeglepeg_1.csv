3:10 to Yuma," Suspend disbelief for the finish
","The cast: Superb! Especially Christian Bale and Ben Foster The scenery: Mesmerizing, gorgeous, sublime The plot: Completely engaging except for the very end! Why, if Wade had had a sudden change of heart and wanted to see his certainly doomed captor succeed in getting him to the train, knowing that his ruthless gang was still surrounding them, would he leave Dan to die in a hail of bullets just outside the train? Wouldn't he be smart enough to know that it would happen? Shouldn't he have dragged Dan onto the train WITH him, to drop him off safely somewhere down the line? The implausibility of it just ruined it for me, but I still appreciate what WAS great about the movie.",8,1,2,24 September 2007
