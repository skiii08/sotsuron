Sucker Punch," Sucker Punched my Birthday to Smitherines
","It's my birthday. Had a great meal with my family then we went to see Sucker Punch. I've just back in from seeing this steaming pile of mess. My review is simple.. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! The Plot. Decent beginning then quickly became a nonsense of metaphors that you could only find in an Anime. The Action. A CGI driven child's fantasy that MADE NO SENSE even for fantasy. The fight sequences (accompanied by woeful soundtrack) quickly became tedious, boring and pointless. The acting was OK for this kinda of movie (I have seen worse) but the script and dialogue were poor..Fans of Final Fantasy will love this movie. The other 99 percent of the planet will hate it.People walked out of the theatre after the first fight sequence because it was clear where the film was going at that point.. NOWHERE. Don't download it. Don't rent it. Don't borrow it. This film is worse than Skyline. Because everybody involved in it should known better.You have been warned.",1,15,32,2 April 2011
Salt," Salt ....even the Title is AWFUL
","Salt is a turn off from beginning to end. Anjelina is past it as an action heroine. Her credibility ended (if there was any doubt) with the movie 'Wanted'. The fight scenes in 'Salt' are WOEFUL and completely unbelievable even by Hollywood standards. The shots were TOO tight (as if trying to hide the fact the fact that choreography was RUBBISH) The plot (imagine Bourne meets Wanted) is irrelevant because you never believe Ms Jolie's character is credible. You feel like what it is, an Actor near the end of their career getting a quick pay day and they don't care if you know it. She doesn't even look good any more so the eye candy or Worthers Originals factor in Ms Jolies case can't carry a turkey of a movie like this any more. If you love action movies like I do then avoid this turkey at all costs. It's not even worth a rental. Simply awful.",1,11,23,1 October 2010
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Hansel & Gretel: Straight to the bottom of the supermarket bargain bin
","My reviews are always simple & too the point. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters currently has a rating of 6.1 stars on IMDb. What! That's 4.1 too many! Here's the redress.I'm not going to tell you how bad the movie is, (just read any of the IMDb 'hated it' reviews they're all pretty much spot on.) I'll just use the two main actors as the only reason you need to AVOID this rubbish.Jeremy Renner: Interesting in the Hurt locker, OK but stiff in the Avengers, sucked in MI 4 (everybody sucked in MI 4), super sucked in the Bourne Legacy. Gemma Arterton, Cool in St. Trinian's, Invisible in RockNRolla, Wooden in: Quantum of Solace, Prince of Persia, Clash of Titans, & every other film she's appeared in. (basically she was born to play Pinocchio's wooden half sister in a remake involving guns & leather costumes & out of context rude language) This film blows & not in a good way.",1,13,30,20 May 2013
Frozen," Disney Is Officially Dead
","Frozen has a score of 8 stars. How, who.. WHY?From the opening Score I knew Frozen was going to bad. I just wasn't prepared for how much & people it's mucho bado! The opening score was clearly used to add a Lion King feel good factor. Why?.. Why would you open a film about cold, ice & snow with African themed music? Why? Where's the context for that music? This sums up Frozen. Lots of goods ideas badly thought out & used outside of a clear context. Disney is dead. Were now back to the dark days of perfect looking women who aspire to get married. Have perfect figures. Men are either overbearing & controlling or stupid & inept.Frozen is 10 steps backwards for girls/women & 100 steps backwards from 'Brave'Ridiculous illogical script, below par humour (two gags in the whole film), annoying characters... the list is endless. The music is average, uninspired & out of context. The songs felt forced & just thrown in randomly because '...We gotta have song here..' They quickly became tiresome, destroying my engagement rather than enforcing it.So Disney. Is this it? Is this what Disney is aspiring to be in the 21st Century? Here's a tip Disney. The more you look backwards the more irrelevant you become to this & future generations. You are not Walt & you shouldn't try to be. That time has passed. My daughter & I grew up with Disney... ...After Frozen.. we both agree Disney is dead.",1,56,111,9 March 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A Lot of Rise and Not much Batman
","There's enough reviews on here about The Dark Knight Rises for me to skip the details and tell you simply...The Dark Knight Rises isn't as good as 'The Dark Knight.' Nowhere Near as good. All fans of the Nolan franchise can agree on that. Batman isn't given enough screen time. All BATMAN fans can agree on that.The villain 'Bane' didn't have the depth of 'Ra's Al Ghul' (Batman Begins) or menace of 'the Joker' (The Dark Knight) and was used mainly as a smoke screen for a sub plot of which there are many. Which brings me to ....The plot. No spoilers but there's a lot going on. Too much. Which took screen time away from the films main character...Batman!I left the cinema feeling entertained yes, but cheated at the same time. Some people (clearly by the amount of 10s handed this film loved it)But I say if Nolan had changed the villain(s), shortened the film and added more action then The Dark Knight Rises would have been a more entertaining and engaging film. Instead we got Too much Rise and not enough Batman. 5/10",5,4,10,22 July 2012
