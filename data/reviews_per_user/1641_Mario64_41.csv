The Blair Witch Project," Scary, origonal, great.
","The Blair Witch Project is a great movie. It's like nothing I've ever seen before and it works. The way the movie introduces you to the characters and developes them works great, and seeing them react to the spookey situations is even better. It's very believable. It's also very scary. It's not stupid slasher scary, which isn't even scary that often now days, it's more like Jaws scary, it builds up a situation that's frieghtening. I just love this movie. Some people hate it which really perplexes me. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,8 August 2001
United 93," A powerful and respectful film about tragedy and heroism
","United 93 has no major stars, and not really any truly amazing performances. It just has everyone doing what they're supposed to adding up to a piece of work that's unquestionably one of the most emotionally gripping in modern cinematic history.The film basically follows a three viewpoints through the tragedies of September the 11th: the air-traffic controllers, the military, and foremost the passengers of United Flight 93. In my opinion the film should win the Academy Award for best Film Editing for moving back and fourth so fluidly between one viewpoint to another, showing how and when certain people learn what's going on, and how and when they make the choices they do. There's not a wasted second of screen time. There is not a lot of character development, and there's absolutely no back stories, and the movie is better off for it. It's about people caught in a tragic situation, about people doing their job, and about people stepping up even when there's a great chance of no great outcome. There are no Hollywood heroes, and even in the case of the terrorists there are no villains, just people being people. We know what's going to happen, and that makes watching the film often nerve-raking, but everything is done with respect and honesty in what happened that day.Director Paul Greengrass deserves a lot of credit for putting together this masterpiece, but ultimately it's the accuracy that holds it together. I'm sure almost endless research was done to keep this film as true as possible. Sure it's not exactly how it happened, which would have been impossible, but it feels like it's exactly how it happened. Not one moment feels phony and the intense sequences don't make you say wow they did that great, they just leave you silent because you're practically experiencing the tragedy from a perspective few other have ever. This film did fair but not great at the box office understandably because many think this is a little too soon. Whether it's too soon to see something like this is up to each individual. For me it wasn't. I would encourage anyone on the fence to see this because it's a movie to experience; just unlike anything in modern film.",10,1,3,4 February 2007
Minority Report," Visionary, thought provoking, and very entertaining
","Minority Report is a work of art with few flaws. It's visually great to look at. Seeing Speilberg's vision of a quite believable possibility of what our world could look fifty years from now is quite breathtaking. This movie will also make you think. It's not quite as great of a movie Speilberg's Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but I can say hands down this is his smartest and most thought provoking film yet. Issues of privacy among others are there and the film let's you make up your own mind. Finally this film is very entertaining. It hooks your from begining to end with it's visuals, very good and captivating performances by Tom Cruise and Collin Farrel, and so much to analyze. On the downside there are a few things that don't make complete sense, but they're so minor it doesn't make that much difference. I was close to giving this movie a 10 but will have to give it a 9 because it's not quite a masterpiece. Great movie overall.",9,0,0,8 July 2002
Training Day," Good and could of been better.
","Training Day is engrossing, shocking, and powerful going three fourths of the way through.  Denzel Washington definitely has a possibility at a best actor nomination as a corrupt cop in one of the best performances he has given in quite a while. Ethan Hawk is also good as one who's just getting to know this corruption. It's over produced but still believable, that is until the last 20 minutes or so. The ending has some effectiveness, but is implausible and contains definet idiocy. The movie could have been great had the ending lived up to the rest of it. Still most of the movie is quite good. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,1,11,6 October 2001
Mulan," A Strong Heroic Tale.
","Mulan came out towards the end of Disney's peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack; that's no insult given how strong most of the films were. This is a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films.Mulan, voiced by Ming-Na Wen, can't seem to act as a 'proper' Chinese lady and find a husband. She decides to take her physically ailing father's place when every family must give a man for war that has come upon them by the Huns. Dressing and acting like a man she's awkward in the training at first, but she eventually becomes one of the most impressive of all the soldiers, while the man leading her and the squad is one she admires and finds quite dashing as well. Along the way she gets some much needed help from a small but determined dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.The film has a nice combination of comedy and action, although they are within a story somewhat clunky at times. This is no doubt a gorgeous film, from ancient Chinese villages to snowy mountain peaks to the Forbidden City. The title character is certainly a strong willed female hero, and mostly it is not by chance but by the choices she makes which determines her fate. Unfortunately she just didn't engage me as a person like any number of other Disney leading ladies; as much as I admired her strength her character basically swung in two modes: awkward bumbling girl and super-brave hero woman. It's a good Disney heroine, but not a great one. The songs are nice, with a couple being fairly memorable.On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn't one of the best Disney animated musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale.One last thought: What the heck were they thinking with that first song in the ending credits? It doesn't fit movie at all.",8,1,1,31 July 2014
Citizen Kane," A great movie!
","Citizen Kane is one great film. The movie's style of a newspapper reporter trying to get information of Mr. Kane's last word, rosebud, is very original. Orson Wells plays as Mr. Kane, and what I think to be one the most interesting characters ever in a movie. This movie tells the fasanating life of Mr. Kane, a newspaper runner, a politician, and a rich millionaire. Every single line and scene in this movie is stunningly believable. There's no doubt about it, Citizen Kane is one of greatest movies ever.",10,0,0,27 March 1999
Happy Gilmore," A bad movie!
","This is not a good movie. It's not as bad as the horrible The Waterboy or Billy Madison, but this movie is still pretty bad. This movie has a poorly played character, Happy Gilmore, who's this stupid person who shouldn't be walking the streets. This stupid idiot goes crazy for not making the ball go in it's hole. Just please avoid this movie!",3,2,6,30 June 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Burton's best work yet.
","I was surprised how much I enjoyed Sleepy Hallow. It of corse follows fairly closely the story of which the movie was named after, but the atmosphere is like something you've never seen. Thoughout this movie you never see sunlight, but it takes you though a dark fasinating world of great visuals. It's a scary movie as well, with effective suspense and good headless horseman special effects. Johny Depp's performance was very good as the interesting Icobad Crain. The only thing I really didn't like about this movie was Christina Ricci, who's character is very flat.Tim Burton has done some good movies like Batman Returns, the Nightmare Before Christmas, and Edward Sissorhands, but this film tops them all. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but it's pretty close. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,5 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A little better than Phantom
","When The Phantom Menace originally came out in 1999, unlike a lot of people, I liked the movie. Overall I was entertained, despite the constant annoyance of Jar Jar Binks. Now Attack of the Clones has come out and it's a little better than The Phantom Menace, but still a galaxy far far away from the original two in the series.First what I didn't like. Too much dialoge. They just talked and talked through a lot of the earlier parts of the movie and it was not always entertaining. The first action scene of the movie I also was not that high about, it lacks total plausability. The worst part of the movie in my mind was definetly the love story. We see the two  stare at eachother and say cheesy lines and I was totally disinterested.Now what I did like. To put it simply the last 45 minutes of the movie are spectacular. The special effects in the movie are increadable and the three last action scenes demonstrate that perfectly. A number of times I found myself just in awe in amazement. This movie ends strong, and that had a big impact on me. I can't discount many of it's flaws during the earlier parts of the movie. It could been much more. Ending strong as it did I give it a 7 out of 10.",6,0,0,26 May 2002
American Pie," A Funny Crude Flick
","American Pie is funny but it also manages to be sweet, sort of. Well it's mostly crude humor in a story about four guys who creat a pact to get laid before high school is over. I laughed out loud a few times and there was a number of smaller laughs. The pie scene is a classic scene in my mind. It also is in the line of movies like There's Something About Mary (though not quite as funny as that movie) that go for both shock value and comedy and work well. I give it a 7 out of 10. I saw the sequel and I would put it a hair behind this one.",7,0,1,7 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great fantasy epic
","The Lord of the Rings is a great movie. It's story is so captivating and so good this movie will hook you and reel you in. The characters are all very well played, from the wizards to the dwarfs to the real people. Visually this movie is spectacular, landscapes, castles and caves look increadable, and the special effects are superb. My only downside is they introduce so many mystical characters it almost becomes overwelming.
Can this movie be called a masterpiece? Not quite in my opinion. Is it a great movie? Absolutely. One of the best fantasy films ever made. Hopefully the next two will follow suit in it's greatness. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,10 August 2002
Cast Away," Another solid Hanks film.
","Cast Away is far from being Tom Hanks' best film but still is a very good movie. The best part of this movie by far is Tom Hanks' great performance, his best performance in a movie since Forrest Gump. I believed every moment the way he acted on the island. I don't know how I would act if I was stunk on an island for a period of time, but like Hanks' character I'm sure I would act a little weird. The downside to this movie is the begining and ending. They weren't bad, just not near as good as the middle section. Also I will not give anything away but I was dissapointed the trailor did, which did take some suspense away. Cast Away is still clear proof that Tom Hanks can perform another type of character in the line of many that he has played well. I give Cast Away an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,12 August 2001
Armageddon," A poor special effect no brainer
","Armageddon is without a doubt the worst movie I seen in 1998 (note: I didn't see The Waterboy, I still know What You Did Last Summer or others that could possibly top it as the worst). This is the basic stupid summer action movie that has a weak plot, poorly acted character, and dumb blurs of special effects. An asteroid is going to destroy earth, oh wow (a very sarcastic wow). The character aren't any better. If these guys were actually the top drilling team on earth they would be smarter and mess up a lot less than they do in this movie. And now the special effects. The simple thing is that half the special effects you can't understand what's happening and the other half they go by without any meaning.All in all I was disappointed in this movie. I wasn't a big fan of other summer blockbusters like Independence Day or Twister, but at least they had a few thing worth seeing. Armageddon is a summer blockbuster at its lowest level. *1/2 out of **** for Armageddon.",3,1,3,4 April 1999
Armageddon," A mess of a movie.
","Armageddon is a loud, annoying, mess of a movie. The script is terrible and like a lot of summer movies the plot has obvious weaknesses, so what it has to do is make up for that aspect with fun actions scenes. Some movies I've seen such as Face/Off and The Mummy were able to, despite their script and plot problems, be at a fun entertaining level enough to make up for their faults. Armageddon fails with action scenes that make no sense, have way to high a frequency of cuts, and are just messy and too loud. If a movie is made purely for eye candy it shouldn't taste like dirt. I give Armageddon a 3 out of 10.",3,0,1,31 July 2001
American Beauty," The Best Film of 1999
","American Beauty is a fantastic movie. It centers around the lives of some very interesting, somewhat dark people. It's both very well written and well acted, everyone doing a great job expecially Kevin Spacy who is one of my favorite actors. As this movie progresses it becomes more and more interesting and deep, and with that more and more disturbing. It's a piece of art everyone who's not a young kid needs to see. I give American Beauty a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,10 August 2001
Ratatouille," An Animated Masterpiece
","Just recently I sat down in my bedroom and watched the Ratatouille DVD on my surround sound system. It was my third time watching the film, and for some reason it may have been the most enjoyable. Well the first time viewing it was at a drive in movie theater, which is not really the best way to enjoy a film, but still I don't think that has anything to do with my appreciating it more in later viewing. Something clicked in my in my third viewing and I said to myself, 'Man, this isn't just a great film, it's a Disney Classic like Beauty and the Beast and Snow White'.Ratatouille does one thing only the brilliant duo of Disney and Pixar could accomplish: not only does it make rats cute, but it makes them enduring characters in an animated film, every bit as much so as the fish in Finding Nemo and the Toys in Toy Story. Remy is a rodent with charming qualities, a great sense of smell and taste and a love of food which leads him to become a chef master. On the line of my belief that this is a classic Disney film, Remy is really the classic Disney animated character.A similar classicalness could be said of Linguini, a somewhat geeky awkward human who befriends Remy after he takes credit, accidentally, for one of the rat's delicious dishes. Linguini needs Remy so he can repeat the recipe or he'll lose his job. The way the human and rat communicate is fascinating, and the way that they arrange how to work together in the kitchen is hilarious and dazzling. The food looks so great here that it makes one hungry while looking at it.And along the way there great supporting characters including Rats like Remy's dopey brother Emile, and humans like Linguini's feisty mentor and love interest Collette, and his insensitive selfish boss Skinner. And there's Gusteau, Remy's imaginary friend, a deceased Chef that guides his journey, and Anton Ego a great representative of a real critic with harsh critiques. But really it's Remy and Linguini that dominate the film, and appropriately so. They have a chemistry that's strong, funny, awkward, angry and joyful; sometimes many of those things all at once.What was true for other Pixar masterpieces is there for Ratatouille. It's a great story, full of well developed characters that are fantastic creations of art, has hilarious and wildly entertaining sequences, and great conflicts between the good and the not so good. But the main goal for the protagonists in this film is not to beat the bad guy; it's for them to produce great food. It's a simple pure idea taken to extraordinary height.I'm doing something I have not done for many films here on IMDb. I'm changing my original rating for a movie. What once was a 9 now is a 10. I believe 20 years from now Ratatouille will be looked at as one of the finest animated achievements of this computer animated era of films. I'm not quite ready to call it a Snow White or Beauty and the Beast (my personal favorite animated movie of all time) but it comes quite close. A Disney Pixar Masterpiece.",10,1,2,21 December 2008
The Fast and the Furious," Okay visuals, but poor plot.
","The Fast and the Furious is movie about illegal drag racing and the people involved with it. Now this movie does have a couple interesting scenes that were somewhat impressive, but that didn't make up for me the movie's bad plot. The plot contains everything from Asian gangs to drag racing which isn't believable (I know it goes on but it's not nearly this produced) to hijacking trucks. This movie doesn't even seem to know what it wants to do, just to throw a lot of stuff out there at once. This movie doesn't help this summer's so far poor track record. I give this movie a 4 out of 10.",4,0,1,8 August 2001
Gone with the Wind," Overrated, but still great.
","Gone With the Wind is an overrated movie, but still a great one. It's not the #4 movie of all time like AFI nominated it, more like the #20 movie of all time. For its time, Gone With the Wind had terrific art-direction and cinematography. Vivien Leigh's performance stands out as one of the greatest female performances ever. Another thing that makes it a great movie is its epic story. All in all Gone With the Wind is no The Godfather, Laurence of Arabia, Casablanca or even Schindler's List, but nonetheless a great classic movie.",10,1,2,29 March 1999
The Butterfly Effect," A pretty bad psychological thriller
","I won't deny that The Butterfly Effect, staring Ashton Kutchor, kept my attention throughout. It isn't the kind of bad movie that makes you want to run away in artistic disgust. It is, however, a bad movie plain and simple from beginning to end; piling on so much ridiculousness and poor writing and stupid clichés one after the other that it makes you wish that you, like the movie's star, could go back a few hours and tell yourself not to watch this dribble.The whole movie revolves around Even Trebon, played by Kutchor, who finds out he can relive memories and even change things in the past by reading a journal of his he kept as a child. This movie doesn't bother explaining anything about this main facet, while it shows annoyingly in action again and again. The biggest problem though isn't that they don't try to give this aspect any depth, it's how it's used in utterly absurd fashion. It's a back and fourth film that gives very little credibility to any of its chapters.The first part of the movie, revolving around Evan's childhood, is merely mediocre. Right off the bat it's somewhat interesting, though clearly tries too hard for its own good. The next two-thirds of the film don't get any better, in fact they get much worse. Kutchor gives basically a one note and pretty weak performance of being initially shocked at how his life has changed after these flashbacks, followed by a journey to get his journal and relive the effect once again. Amy Smart gives the film's best performance, and while not a great performance that often revolves around the movies over-reactions, it's the biggest bright spot in the movie. After all the overacting, lethargic time changes, and just stupid and often unnecessary scenes in prisons, college campuses and mental institutes, it becomes clear that this film really never tried to give itself much credibility. The conclusion is as unimpressive as anything and by that time, while I was still watching, I really didn't care.I give the movie points for Amy Smart and some interesting ideas, but that's about all it has. It wasn't a dreadfully boring movie like many bad films are, but it's bad in the nature it plays out. Of all the going back in time films I have seen this is by far the worst and most ridiculous. Back to the Future and Terminator expanded the mind and intrigued the hell out of us with quandaries of effecting the future. What the Butterfly Effect does is explain nothing, and try so many things that don't work that it practically oozes as something made by someone with a severe case of ADHD. I'm shocked how well this movie has been received by IMDb voters. I think it's officially the most overrated movie ever on this site. Critics pounded the film as it deserved to be. It's not plausible, it's not even the least bit credible, and you'll do yourself a favor by not seeing this steaming pile of crap.3 out of 10.",3,8,14,30 August 2005
Saving Private Ryan," A Great War Experience
","Saving Private Ryan may very well be the greatest war film in existence. The Movie opens with the D-Day invasion at Normandy. Blood flying everywhere, pieces of body parts are missing, even a guy who sits there and screams while trying to hold his guts in, make that first war scene a scene you will never forget. Not only does this movie have realistic war scenes but also has a very good script and top notch performances by Tom Hanks and Tom Seizmore. Go see this movie unless you're too squeamish to handle the graphic violence. **** out of **** for SPR.",10,0,0,21 April 1999
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Equals, If Not Surpasses, The First
","How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the rare animated sequel that both goes deeper and is just as exciting as the original. The story takes place some years after the events in How to Train Your Dragon, the kid characters notably having matured to about their mid-teenage phase, and notably more experienced in their flying-dragons trade. From the beginning, it accepts the cooperation between Viking and dragon, flying and diving through the air, and we never doubt the logic of it.As the characters are more mature, so is, appropriately, the story, being more complex and darker than the original, without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to accomplish that. Hiccup and his loyal dragon Toothless are back, doing more impressive feats, going further and further from their home, exploring beautiful new environments and encountering new things, some friendly and many not. Our other Vikings and giant flying lizards in all their varieties (and solid voice work) are back from the original, and we see some new ones, including terrific sinister villain. But I hold back on telling too much, for to give much beyond the premise, and early scenes of discovery, would be a disservice to viewers coming to see it.This is an exhilarating, creative, and gorgeous piece of work, with hardly a dull moment to be found. It's not quite a perfect or near perfect animated film, with some tired humor and a bit of a rushed ending. Still it's one of DreamWorks' best efforts to date, so definitely see it.",8,0,0,16 March 2017
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Fantastic Movie
","When a movie that gets an extremely high rating  as this movie has and gets as many poor reviews as this is getting it usually means the rare ones who don't like it are so jelous of the movie's popularity they need to write multiple reviews to make people understand their minority opinion. It's ranked 21st so please, the vast majority of people love this movie. The rating is a much better indicator than the reviews are on how people like a movie. I write reviews because I want to express my opinion, not because I have an unusually high ego. Now to the movie. It has a great story, fantastic beautiful art direction and cinamatography, and some of the best fight scenes ever on film. No performances in particular are spectacular, but they still all do a great job and the atmosphere is so great  that just their presense seems spectacular. The best movie of 2000 no question in my mind and by far the best martial arts movie ever made.",10,1,1,27 August 2001
Schindler's List," one of my top 5 favorites ever!
","Schindler's List is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made in the 90's and for me is among the top 5 greatest movies ever. I believed every second of this masterpiece. Great performances by Liam Neason, Ben Kingsly and Ralph Fiennes work, but the truly great things about this movie are the effective Jewish performances and and the incredible art-direction this movie has. Schindler's list is not a film for young kids, but everybody over the age of 14 should see this great movie.",10,9,14,16 April 1999
Mission: Impossible II," A Good Action movie
","This movie may not have a great plot and may be closer to James Bond than Mission Impossible. Still this movie is great fun and better than the origonal. I liked that I could actually understand the plot unlike the the first MI and it was interesting. Okay so they over do the face mask thing and it's somewhat implausable. This movie was done by Jon Woo, who did Face/Off among other good action movies and he doesn't fail here. The ending action sequence in this movie is right up there with the ending in the origonal MI as one of the greatest action scenes ever in a movie. This is not a great action movie but it's a good one with enough in it to make it satisfying. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,5 August 2001
The Mummy Returns," Doesn't have the fun of the original
","The Mummy Returns has a lot of great special effects but it missed what made the original an ejoyable flick. The original The Mummy wasn't a great movie but it had a style and a sense of fun to it. This time around the story makes less sense and worse it's never really that interesting. A lot of things happened but I became bored at times. There are some pretty good scenes in the movie like the chase by the mummies on a double deckar bus, but during most action scenes I just thought so what. There are also silly subplots they could have just done without. Great special effects, not so great execution. 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,26 December 2001
Toy Story 2," Better than the original, a hair behind Shrek.
","I saw this movie just yesterday and I had a great time. It improved upon the first Toy Story in the area of comedy and fun and was equally good as far as character developement. I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did, including using a lot of neat references. Shrek is still the best computer animated movie ever in my book. Toy Story 2 doesn't quite have it's level of charm. Still Toy Story 2 is loads of fun for all ages. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,5 November 2001
There's Something About Mary," Very Funny!
","This movie has a fairly poor story. It's about the hot Chick, Mary, and the guys who just want to shag her. Who care's about a story when a movie is this funny. It's just a laugh after laugh after laugh. A few times it hurt quite a bit it was just so funny. It has a sentamental side as well which isn't bad. I have seen this movie four times loved it every time. It can't be called a masterpiece but it's just an enjoyable ride. I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,6 August 2001
Life Is Beautiful," Good, but overrated
","Life is Beautiful is a good movie, I just can't understand its increadable high praise by people. The first part of the movie, dealing with coming of love between the couple, was fairly delightful, even if it being kind of corny. The second half is not worse than the first, but not really better than it either. Benini's character convinces his son that their just in a game when their actually in a concentration camp. That worked for a little bit but after a while it got kind of sappy. You keep wondering if it's actually going to do more harm to the kid than good. The movie has it's funny moments, and it's warm hearted moments, but I really can't call it a great movie. Benini's performance is good, but I kind of think the only reason he won best actor was for people to see a guy jumping over chairs and acting crazy. I give it a 7 out of 10.",6,1,3,7 August 2002
Pulp Fiction," A great original flick
","Pulp Fiction is trully one of the best movies of the 90's. It's wondarfully made and entertaining from begining to end. It's not a standardly played movie, instead it's not in sequence and comes together at the end. It's trully ogininal. The performances are also great, my favorite being John Travolta's. If you haven't seen this movie see it at once, it will be a classic.",10,0,1,25 June 2001
The Da Vinci Code," Dull experience
","I read the book beforehand, and it's by no means a great book, but I think certain things work better for literature than they do on film, and this is one of those cases. Without spoiling anything the whole back storyline about the Knights and the Grail and the bloodline and whatever else is pretty absurd in both the book and film, but in the film the plot line in the present is greater exposed. For instance in the book the constant chase sequences were pretty exciting, but in the film it becomes more clear that the cat and mouse game lacks imagination and more or less is an elaborate version of peek-a-boo. And the changes they make in the movie version, while I understand some had to be done for time constraints, for the most part do not seem to help it, and only make it a lesser experience. One last thing about the movie book comparison: the weak character development in the book is also greater exposed in the movie. That last one is this movie's greatest failure.Now judging the movie by itself it just comes off as dull: dull dialog, dull characters, and for the most part dull action sequences if one even wants to call them that. Tom Hank's performance as Dr. Robert Langdon, the main character of the story, is one of the most underwhelming and dry I've ever seen him do, and Audrey Tautou as Agent Sophie Neveu falls flat right from her weak introduction, with her motivations hardly ever being clear. What one is left with are some nice plot twists, and Ian McCellen's worthy performance of historian Leigh Teabling.I have to admit stories like this just aren't my thing. I just don't get enticed by these silly treasure hunt stories, as would be clear from me disliking the movie National Treasure as well. But I think I like this movie even less because Nation Treasure knew it was being silly, while this film tries to take itself a little more seriously and the results are less entertaining. I can understand how one could come to saying this is a passable experience. However I would recommend this to no one. Like I said at the beginning of this review it works better as a book. As a film the story flaws are exposed more clearly, and it's unfortunate a great director like Ron Howard couldn't have done more with it.",3,0,2,26 December 2006
Titanic," A very good movie
","As a teenage guy it may seem weird to hear that Titanic was a very good movie from my mouth, but it is. Leonardo DiCaprio was very believable in this movie and to a lesser extent so was Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart. This movie was very well created with excellent art-direction and cenematography. The sinking of the ship in this movie is so good, that when I saw it in the theaters I almost felt that I was in the middle of the Atlantic on a huge sinking ship. This movie wasn't the best movie of 1997, LA Confidential was that. Still Titanic may be the best combination of very good acting and great special effects I've ever seen. **** out of **** for Titanic.",9,1,2,27 March 1999
Zero Dark Thirty," Possibly the finest achievement of the decade.
","Three years after Kathryn Bigelow, after a relatively quiet few-decade-long film directing career, really showed what she was capable of with the Iraq war masterpiece The Hurt Locker, she comes with a movie far more ambitious, and also quite a bit more controversial, about the decade long search for Osama Bin Laden starting from 9/11, called Zero Dark Thirty. It absolutely lives up to, if not surpasses, her previous Oscar winning effort.Bigelow's passion for this subject is in just about every shot, with immense detail, cold bluntness, and enough humanity to keep it from being too oppressing. Actually for a two and a half hour film it's quite efficient filmmaking, jam-packed with numerous interrogations and investigation tactics (the torture stuff that has garnered controversy is only a very small part of that) shaking real life terrorist attacks, and political wrangling, yet it's never confused or disjointed. Even towards the end with the recreations of the raid on the compound in Pakistan done very deliberately, the pacing is never betrayed, maintaining consistent movement and direction; it's a scene that plays out as much mystery as suspense as the seal team goes from room to room blowing out locked doors and not knowing for certain if the main target is there.The movie's structure, with one main character, Maya a member of the CIA played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, taking a part in virtually every aspect of this manhunt, with other people revolving in their various tasks around her, was the perfect choice. If one person really did have this much impact on the manhunt we'll probably never know for sure, but in this film it's played out believably and compellingly, and though no one can match her neither is anyone else insignificant to how it plays out. Characters with only a few scenes have noticeable impacts. But with Maya is the emotion, determination, the sassiness and intelligence of a woman who evolves in nuanced but never uninteresting ways.Zero Dark Thirty is an incredible achievement, and in my mind candidate for best film made so far this decade. It has brought about an important debate, but more significantly it covers ten years of the war on terror in prime fashion. Bigelow plays for high realism but she also knows how to create great drama by stretching but never breaking those confines. Every scene belongs for a purpose and never does it feel like one is missing; that in itself is an incredible achievement. Credit her, the cast, and, not to forget, the great script by Mark Boal.",10,1,6,28 December 2013
12 Years a Slave," A Very Moving and Important Story
","12 Years a Slave, directed by Steve McQueen, is, if not a perfect film, among the very important pieces of modern cinema. It's based on a true story of a man named Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, a free black man in New York state, who one day is tricked and kidnapped and sold down south into slavery in the early 1840's. Seeing his life, and then seeing it suddenly ripped away is truly disturbing and heart-wrenching. It's not that we should feel worse for him than those who were born into slavery, who treated as bad or in many cases much worse; but telling the tale through the contrast highlights, extremely effectively, how inhumane this slave culture was.Northup, after the terrifying transition into confinement, is shuttled from his kidnappers to slave traders to a plantation, and when that doesn't turn out so well to another plantation, the last where the majority of the movie takes place. All parts of the journey tell the struggle he goes through in different ways, and show the injustices of the era—all obviously awful—came in a variety, not a picture that can be drawn with a broad brush. It's unflinching in its brutality, to a critical and real purpose. Ejiofor is outstanding, as is Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson, and the host of supporting roles; included are some well-known actors who never come across as cameos but as very human pieces of this story that fit exceptionally well into the history, and never distract. Good and bad guys and those in-between, no one is typified by clichés or with complete simplicity.Slavery is the United States' greatest sin. It's unfortunate it took nearly 100 years for our cinema to get from Birth of Nation to 12 Years a Slave, but now that it's here it's something that must be watched—watched by all Americans to further understand their history as this movie forthrightly displays; watched all film lovers for its powerful, exquisite craft on screen; and watched by all people to stress what can occur when a group of people is dehumanized in a culture. Slavery, or things not that far from slavery, still occur in too many corners of the world, we as a species are not past this completely still, and that is something we can be reminded of with this informative, tough and quite masterful drama on the subject.",9,0,2,17 September 2016
The Green Mile," A powerful and emotional film
","The Green Mile a very effective, powerful and well performed movie. Tom Hanks is good as always but this is one of the rare films he has been in where he did not give the movie's best performance, that belonged to Michael Clark Dunkan's performance as a mysterious person on death row that has the power to heal. This movie is all very well crafted and well paced. This movie isn't perfect though. Racism didn't seem to be an issue at all which is kind of strange it being the 1930s. I can't quite call this film a masterpiece because in some ways it's kind of sketchy. Still it's powerful and deep. I give it an 8 out of 10.",7,0,1,12 August 2001
Shrek," A Terrific Film!
","Shrek is the best movie I've seen all year by far, and the best ever computer animated film even better than Toy Story 2. This movie is just halarious, one joke after another, and they're not the kind of jokes only kids will laugh at. I loved all the characters, my favorite being Eddie Murphy as a loud mouth talking donkey. This movie is always entertaining, always fun, it's funny, it's exciting, it's somewhat deep, it's a great movie. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,28 July 2001
Vanilla Sky," Cruise saves the movie from being dreadful
","Vanilla Sky is a tale about a man in a love triangle with two women, with twists and turns and everything in between. I thought Cruise was particularly good, and the best thing about the movie. Diaz is also good. Penelope Cruz, however, hasn't seemed to have found her acting ability quite yet. Either that or she's taking roles she doesn't play well. Anyway I enjoy some movies like this, that confuse you greatly and bring it all together in the end. The problem was  that I really wasn't that satisfied on the big twist that came in the end. It's far from a bad movie, just not on the level for me as say an Eyes Wide Shut. I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,8 July 2002
Final Destination," Interesting idea that falls short
","It's an interesting idea to create a movie about a bunch of people who escape death and destiny keeps coming after them, trying to kill them. A hell of a lot more original than most thrillers/horror movies now days right. Final Destination takes that idea and falls short because of it's stupidity. There many plot holes and the script is poor at best. What's just as bad is most of the characters are just bone heads. On the positive side there are some dramatic scenes that are exciting and original that leave you somewhat satisfied after the fact. However, those can't quite make up for it's faults. Hard core horror movie fans, which I'm not, will probably apreciate this film more than I did, given the fact it's well above the average of today's horror flicks. I give it a 5 out of 10.",5,1,1,28 June 2002
The Matrix," An enjoyable, visually impressive flick.
","The Matrix was a surprising delight of a movie. The story is deep and interesting and it flows along well. The visuals are the best part of this movie. It's great effects to the likes of which we really have never seen before and are done in a way that's just fasinating. The characters are mostly all played well, particularly Keanu Reaves who plays his best role since Speed. The only downside to this movie is that in the end it really never gives you any clear thought to what has really happened. Still I really liked this movie and give it an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,8 August 2001
Braveheart," A good battle epic.
","Braveheart is the story of William Wallace and his vengeance of a love one, uniting of the Scots against the English in the fight for vengeance and freedom. The acting is good all around, but the antagonists of the film are played too much as evil English stereotypes. The heroes, Wallace and his band of Scottish warriors, you cheer for, in spite of the brutality, but I can't help feel at least a bit of manipulation that pulls me in that direction.The best part of the movie is the battles. They are brutal, graphic, and believable. Braveheart isn't something you'll want to get a history lesson from though. It sells the story well enough, but after researching on the internet the history is apparently quite bad even by Hollywood standards. Still the bad history does nothing to diminish the effect of the amazing battle scenes that hold up superbly 15 years later.Braveheart can't be mentioned in the same breath as Lawrence of Arabia, Ben Hur, or Gone With the Wind, as masterpieces of epic storytelling. What it is is a bloody, rousing, entertaining, exciting, and romantically delightful film. Nothing more and nothing less. No it did not deserve to win Best Picture, but hey it's 3 Hours that are never dull, and that are sometimes rather impressive.",8,2,6,1 August 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Nothing Quite Like it Ever Made. It's Marvelous!
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the sort of fascinatingly original movie-going experience that one almost never sees from an existing franchise. And when it comes to 'part 4s' in the history of all of cinema, I can't think of one I've ever liked more. George Miller, who directed the series' other three entries, is back to do the job again here almost 30 years after the last one, and he proves to be cinematically as sharp as ever. The fine accomplishments of actors and all the technical people notwithstanding, this is a director's film more than anything, with a sweeping vision of a post-apocalyptic world that, however crazy it gets, sells itself all the way through. You don't question what you see—you feel you are there.It stars Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, and Tom Hardy as Mad Max—that's in order of importance. Max is a good character, the continued tortured soul trying survive, and yet finding the humanity in himself; but with all respect Furiosa is the real soul of this movie, the best performance (I'd put it Theron's best character since her Oscar winning turn in 'Monster') a woman strong, cunning and skilled, yet also at points vulnerable, as she leads a troop of wives away from their powerful, malicious husband who chases them basically from one end of the movie to the other. Max gets caught up with them along the way, in an interesting evolving relation towards Furiosa and the wives. These wives, five of them, don't get a lot of lines, but the qualities they bring in something different from both Max and Furiosa is important to the film's success. Vital too are the host of villains, who come in such variety of interesting dark flavors, from the head evil master, down the hierarchy of his lower-ranked cohorts, to the followers convinced of the glory of self-sacrifice for their leader.This movie is marvelously thick with post-apocalyptic atmosphere. It is also thrilling, and so varied with every action or chase sequence that rolls brilliantly off of the previous one. There are moments of slowdown, so to speak, where there is verbal interaction more than a couple words at a time, but as far as character building there's as much during the action as in the less hectic times. This is a constantly surprising, original film, frequently exciting, sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and absolutely never for any minute stretch uninteresting. The technical expertise to create such wild, high-flying (figuratively and literally) things as are shown here is just mind-boggling, but creativity is where it really excels. It's one captivating experience, not quite like anything else that's been made before. It must be seen.",9,0,7,3 September 2016
Gladiator," Very good but overrated.
","Gladiator is a very good movie. Russel Crow and Jaquin Pheonix both give quality performances and the movie is exciting and fun. The gladiator scenes in this movie were done well and interesting to watch, even though I have no idea how realistic they are. Still this movie is definatly not best picture quality. The screenplay is good, not great, and the story is really only slightly better than average. This movie has many similarities to another movie I felt was overrated, Braveheart. It's still very good, just not great. I give Gladiator an 8 out of 10.",7,0,0,11 August 2001
