The Equalizer," A popcorn flick which could have been so much more...but still fun though.
","Who does not like Denzel Washington...? Not many people. The fact is that there is something really cool about the characterizations he creates which often are underplayed and stick in our memory for a long time after the viewing. He likes to transform himself from character to character but always leaves that groove walk that became in some way his signature. The problem with Hollywood film industry is that once something worked in the past it will be repeated. Production companies almost never want to take a risk with the original projects. It is better to find some old movie or TV show and make a new spin off based on the old concept. This is where 'The Equalizer' fits in on paper, very enjoyable and existing triller that is based on 80's TV series originally starring Edward Woodward. Russell Crowe was originally attached to star as Robert McCall eventually the role went to Denzel and probably with better effect. The only minus is that Denzel has done this type of part on more than one occasion. Tony Scott's 'Man on Fire' immediately comes to mind, also 'Safe House', 'Out of Time ' as well as to some extend 'Training Day'. This last one was directed by Antoine Fuqua who also happens to be director of 'The Equalizer'. Sadly the genius of 'Training day' did not follow him here even though he did the best he could with the material presented to him in the script by Richard Wenk adopted from TV show ideas of Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. 'McCall (Denzel Washington) is a former black ops commando who has faked his death to live a quiet life in Boston. (we find out about that though half way through the movie) When he comes out of his self-imposed retirement to rescue a young girl, Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), he finds himself face to face with ultra-violent Russian gangsters. As he serves vengeance against those who brutalize the helpless, McCall's desire for justice is reawakened. If someone has a problem, the odds are stacked against them, and they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer.'I wish the script would have been better because there is truly potential here with the cast that has been assembled. Every movie needs a good antagonist and Marton Csokas as Teddy offers a good counterpart to Denzel's character. His mix of sophistication and sadism offers well needed dose of balance between humanity (McCall) and evil (Russian mafia's 'cleaner' Teddy). The scene between McCall and Teddy in the restaurant when they come face to face is one of the best and most intense acting wise. Watching that scene brought to mind another iconic scene form movie the 'Heat' between Pacino and DeNiro. Very enjoyable indeed, full of depth and internal dialog specially played in close up where the eyes do the talking.The action scenes are shot in manner that resemble bit Tony Scott's style of filmmaking, in fact the whole film stylistically might have been inspired by work of the late director. Before every action scene McCall as a gimmick start his stop watch and estimates how long it will take him to kill subjects with the shortest amount of time. He choreographs the attack based on the threat and objects that he uses as weapons with minimal amount of movement. Despite of the unoriginal story and perhaps little bit cliché ending I did enjoy 'The Equalizer' for what it was. A popcorn flick which could have been so much more. But then again money roles Hollywood and judging by response of the audience tonight 'The Equalizer' will make good box-office. I am just hoping for Denzel Washington that he will not get type casted with this type of roles which he always does really well, but here he did not have much to do, in terms of his character development. Though he was still ice cool as always.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",8,2,7,23 September 2014
If I Stay," Prolonged DMT trip!
","'They say your whole life flashes in front of your eyes just before you die...' or so they say. This quote it is an actual quote from my feature film '11' which seems so fitting to the new romantic drama 'If I Stay'. It has been proved scientifically that in the moment of tragic death our pineal gland produces a psychedelic compound called DMT (Dimethyltryptamine). The way the mystics explain this is that DMT allow us a last psychedelic trip that eases our transition to the next world, if you believe in life after death that is. This brings closure to the soul which is then able to move on to an afterlife without any attachments. To a larger sense this is what 'If I Stay' is all about, a prolonged DMT trip. 'Mia Hall (Chloë Grace Moretz) thought the hardest decision she would ever face would be whether to pursue her musical dreams at Juilliard or follow a different path to be with the love of her life, Adam (Jamie Blackley). But what should have been a carefree family drive changes everything in an instant, and now her own life hangs in the balance. Caught between life and death for one revealing day, Mia has only one decision left, which will not only decide her future but her ultimate fate.'The set up is straight forward, she is a classical cello player, he is a rockstar with abandonment issues and yet there is an attraction there that is powerful enough to concur death in someway. There is a sweetness about this film that creates sense of nostalgia in the viewer revisiting in our memory the people we've lost to a sickness or other type trauma. This type of empathy is absolutely necessary to fully be able to enjoy this film. Those of you who do not like to go inwards and examine those feeling might leave the cinema with bitter grim on the face. They say how can you know true joy if you've never experience true sorrow. As the main character is stuck in coma she revisits all the important moments in her life that shaped who she is. Should she come back to life knowing that possibly she will be an orphan or should she go into the gentle night. I don't think that by the end of this film there was a dry eye in the screening room. Big credit goes to the actors delivering very believable performances. Chloë Grace Moretz seems to be on a roll. After 'Kick-Ass' and remake of 'Carrie' she really is raising fast on the Hollywood star leader. She delivers very sympathetic and full of depth performance that might get stuck in you head for a while after watching. Mireille Enos in a supporting role as her mother brings messiness and punk rocker demeanor in to otherwise soulful performance. Jamie Blackley playing Adam showcases his voice a young rockstar charisma with ease. Other members of the supporting cast like Stacy Keach (Gramps) and Liana Liberato (Kim) as well as Joshua Leonard who plays the father who sacrifices his dream of being rockstar so that his little girl can get the cello she uses to become a skilled musician. All the credit should not go only to the cast but should be shared with the director R.J. Cutler who in fact before this film had mostly documentary experience. He was able to create a safe environment for the actors to truly share themselves with the audience. 'If I Stay' is recommended to the audience who is not afraid to confront their sense of loss and to some extent pain because this is what this movie all about.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",8,0,1,18 September 2014
Fury," Very good film full of wonderful acting performances even if the plot of the story has got something to be desired.
","Apparently the first thing you being taught in the army when you are send on to the battlefield is that you have to accept that one day you will die. It can be 60 years from now or if that is your destiny it will be today in the chaos of war. If you except that then the fear of dying turns to adrenaline that actually helps you to survive. We could go further with this train of thought and fall back on Gnostic philosophy of existence where we are considered spark of divinity, soul- light that is trapped in this sinful world of matter only to return into the source where our soul comes from. The reason why women in most religious traditions are treated as the negative principal of creation is because your mothers womb is in reality your tomb. The second you are starting your materialistic sinful carnation in the world of matter, in reality it is beginning of your death as your cells are dying on a daily basis and are reborn once again. Coming back to the review it definitely takes special kind of a man to become a soldier. The horrors of war that most soldiers go through are unimaginable for most people. This is why successful war movies are so scares and majority of time the balance between the drama, character development and the plot needs to be achieved to make sure that the mainstream audience will be able to empathize with the characters and the story. Majority of time in war movies you have a cinema full of male viewers. It rarely happens that the audience is evenly divided between women and men. This is what the presence of Brat Pitt does to the success at the box office. Writer-director David Ayer created truly something very special in his newest WWII drama 'FURY' which might be early contender to the next year Oscar race for the best movie. Yes indeed! He is also responsible for writing hit movies like 'Training Day', 'U-571', 'The Fast and the Furious' and directed in the past very solid but far from perfect movies like 'End of Watch' and 'Harsh Times'. In 'FURY' he accomplishes possibly his best and most technically difficult movie so far mainly with a development of characters where plot became secondary to the realistic depiction of carnage of war. This film offers the viewer a claustrophobic experience of being one of the crew members of US tank under the leadership of Don 'Wardaddy' Collier played valiantly by excellent Brat Pitt.'April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Out-numbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.'The whole movie despite of lacking a clear plot line and in essence is just three battlefield scenes that showcase the deterioration of our characters and their moral values testing them as human beings who try to survive at all cost. The war creates monsters on both sides and is a clear test of who our characters are inside. Are they moral people or just animals that in heat of the battle forget about their humanity and compassion. The acting is superb from all the principles. Brat Pitt delivers one of his better performances as brave tank commander who tries to make sure that his crew will get through the horrors of war in one piece. Shia LaBeouf goes method in his performance and apparently refused to take showers during the full time of filming as well he pulled his lower tooth to get in to character of companioned religious Boyd 'Bible' Swan who becomes the moral barometer of the crew developing almost love like admiration towards his commanding officer. Then Jon Bernthal and Michael Peña offer wonderful rich support to the lead actors with Logan Lerman playing a rookie that joins the crew. In some way we observe the horror of war through his eyes and the director is hinting that in some way Pitt's character sees himself in this young intelligent man that has a compassion towards his enemy. The battlefield scenes are realistic in it's violence and often leave us speechless feeling like we are in the middle of actual combat. Movies like 'Das Boot' and 'U-571' come to mind where the claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in the metal tin can that stands between them and the enemy enhances the actual cinematic experience. Being 134 minutes long as the audience we are truly engaged into this character driven story that has a potential to not be overlooked in next years Oscar race. Very good film full of wonderful acting performances even if the plot of the story has got something to be desired.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",9,4,10,26 October 2014
The Irishman," Scorsese's work will be studied for decades to come and 'The Irishman' becomes one of the chapters of life of this magnificent, insightful director.
","By now plenty has been written about how the CGI de aging effects ruined the new movie of master director Martin Scorsese titled 'The Irishman'.
Dear Reader,
if thats all you focused on, then you have missed the point of this movie. Now, If you are Scorsese do you wait another 5 or 10 years for the CGI technology to develop more and risk possibly loosing one or more lead actors due to old age, or you go for it and finally make a passion project that has been brewing in your mind for over a decade.
Just like with government organized crime syndicate popularly called the Mafia, has its own code of ethics and loyalty. You never share information with law reinforcements agents and you make sure that code of silence is maintained under the penalty of death. All differences are always sort out internally without reliance on outside forces.
Film as the art form is a wonderful tool that permits the filmmaker under vail of artistic exploration to make films that can try to explore some historical unsolved mysteries and yet protects the filmmaker from breaking the code of silence. Oliver Stone did that successfully in his 3 hour long assassination biopic JFK and now Martin Scorsese with 'The Irishman' is trying to do the same by exploring the unsolved mystery of what happened to Jimmy Hoffa.
'The Irishman' is 3 and a half hours long which for attention span of a modern viewing audience can be bit beyond their grasp. Now, without generalizing this film will be experienced by you depending on your age and intellectual capacity. That doesn't mean that the younger audience will not enjoy 'The Irishman' as more mature movie goer does, its just means that based on the technological advancement in style of narration like, TV channel Mtv with its fast editing the younger audience has grown in maintaining their attention span for shorter periods and get easily board with style of narration which Scorsese explores in 'The Irishman'. Again this is not a statement but more of a observation. And now lets get to the movie itself and let me tell you what I think works in this film. By the end I will be honest with what did not workout.
As most of you know by now 'The Irishman' indirectly tells the story of disappearance of influential Track Union President Jimmy Hoffa in 1975 played wonderfully by Al Pacino but Hoffa's story seems to be only a part of the plot that is being told in span of 60 years. Pacino enters the movie after 47 minutes is passed which means he isn't the protagonist of the story, Robert DeNiro's character Frank Sheeran is.
As the titled 'The Irishman' we follow his story as a ex military, husband and the father who is trying to provide for his family. He encounters by a chance unassuming yet powerful gentleman Russell Bufalino brilliantly underplayed by Joe Pesci who happens to be affiliated with Italian Mob. Both man become close life long friends and we see their relationship evolving during act one of the movie. Act two seems to be introduction of Jimmy Hoffa's character which eventually will lead, without giving away too much, to loyalty test put forth by Bufalino to our protagonist. Both Sheeran and Hoffa grow fond of each other as well as their families which enhances the emotional stakes of whats happens in climax of the movie.
There is a lot to like in 'The Irishman'. Stylistically Scorsese delivers movie we would expect from him that looks beautiful in terms of coverage. Long dolly shots that are used as moving masters to set up the geography of locations punctuated by close up inserts and cutaways of objects the characters touch in the scene which enhances the cinematic style of Scorsese.
Of course this wouldn't have been Scorsese movie if the characters would not share their thought with the audience using voiceover. In film schools instructors insist on not using VO claiming and probably rightfully so that it is a lazy way of exposition. In film we show, we don't tell. However Scorsese broke this rule and made voiceover exposition his stylistic calling card.
Personally I didn't mind the CGI de aging effects specially considered that they are used primarily in act one. Did they looked perfect? No, however they were not bad enough to take me out of the movie. What I mind was the body language, Its extremely hard to make 75 year old man move like he is 45. The scene that comes to mind is when DeNiro comes to the store to confront a man that manhandled of of his daughters. Scorsese decides to keep the whole sequence in long shot showing the whole incident from far which doesn't work, becouse DeNiro's body looks old and not energetic enough to 'sell'' the beating of the shop clerk to the audience. Scenes like this one took me out of the film more so then the problems with CGI.
I think the hidden Oscar worthy jam in 'The Irishman' is Joe Pesci. Where most will gravitate towards Pacino and DeNiro charismatic character performances, I loved what Pesci did with his character. There is duality in his performance which is often rewarded by the Academy members.
Small characteristic works very well in medium of film and Pesci in his performance explorers little nuances that lended him an Oscar back in a day. I am very happy we had a chance to see his talent again and hopefully we see more of him in other projects.
The cinematography and lighting is beautiful. Blocking (the movement of actors in relation to the camera) is very well choreographed, but its not as good as lets say 'Goodfellas' where famous bar scene comes to mind, when lead couple enter the nightclub through the kitchen, with camera tracking them all the way to their table inside the nightclub. This type of scenes are technically very difficult to shoot not only coz of the technical-light challenges, but also in terms of choreography of extras and actors. Everything has to aline perfectly, because there is no way to fix it in post-production being one consecutive take. With long tracking shots like above mentioned one from 'Goodfellas' Scorsese showcases his mastery of the filmmaking medium.
And now on to what doesn't quite work. Apart what I already mentioned (CGI and old body language) this film is simply too long. Honestly it could have ended being 3 hours long. The last 30 minutes becomes meditation on aging and perhaps to some extent an intimate glimpse to Scorsese, who perhaps feels as a aging director is part of cinema style which with time is becoming a dying art. As I was watching DeNiro's character preparing his funeral arrangement I couldn't help to think in the back of my mind that Scorsese kept that last 30 minutes to show something important which he is perhaps dealing with on a personal level.
Is 'The Irishman' a masterpiece? History will show. I think the problem most viewers will deal with is that in this film the protagonist of the story (DeNiro) is a antihero. He is a hitmen who murders people for mafia bosses. That last 30 minutes of the film he has a chance for redemption which he is looking for specially in the eyes of his kids completing the character arc. And in essence just like his daughter we are watching him trying not to judge his actions, but we just simply cant forgive him because even in confession scene he doesn't shows his true self ultimately missing out on redemption. This is the ultimate fault of 'The Irishman'. No clear character ark in his protagonist.
I am very pleased that after many financing problems (originally 'The Irishman' was suppose to be produced by Paramount which eventually back out) ending on estimated 159 mil budget from Netflix we were fortunate to have 'The Irishman' written in to filmography history books.
Scorsese's work will be studied for decades to come and 'The Irishman' becomes one of the chapters of life of this magnificent, insightful director.",9,2,3,2 December 2019
Interstellar," It will take another 10 years to made me experience another movie the way I've experienced the 'INTERSTELLAR'.
","Watching the IMAX version of the 'INTERSTELLAR' the first time around I sat through in amazement what could be considered, there I will say it, arguably the smartest movie of the decade! The actual experience that is the 'INTERSTELLAR' goes far beyond the normal movie going event. Nolan shot the movie using 70MM IMAX camera tailored specially for viewers that want to see this movie in all it's glory in IMAX. He used majority of a real locations and stayed away for using CGI. 'INTERSTELLAR' lensed by Hoyte Van Hoytem takes advantage of not only the size of the screen but most of all it sound capability. Nolan took a full advantage of that and I must say I didn't mind the sound mix one bit.In fact I think in terms of music Hans Zimmer once again outdone himself creating score, that is simple, yet emotionally strong, being an integral part of the storytelling experience. His compositions usually consists of simple few notes that become the emotionally associated with particular character or situation, which is brought back in correct moments of the movie to heighten the emotional impact.Hans Zimmer decided to remove himself form typical orchestral strings motives and opted for more grand organ arrangement that complements the film experience to the perfection. Bravo indeed! Now lets go back to Christopher Nolan and his wonderful filmmaking talent. I must admit I am a long time fan of his work and always admired the fact that he has a talent combining the intellectual art house stories with big scale Hollywood production. 'INTERSTELLAR' cost 165 million dollars and has been produced by two companies to alleviate the risk, however with Nolan there are no risks involved. He is able to do something unprecedented since the time of Stanley Kubrick maintain the creative control over his movies, something most Hollywood directors struggle with. His previous movies made over 1 billion Dollars each so in some sense he has earned the respect of the industry the hard way. What's need to be noticed is the fact that he writes (together with his brother Jonathan) most of his movies. Some of the best Hollywood directors use someone else's material to create their movies. Not Nolan. The movies he directs are multilayered narratively and I applaud him for challenging the audience intellectually in times when Hollywood majority of time makes movies which are often dumb down, tailored to the average movie goer which they believe is not that bright in the first place. It is very difficult to explain complex issues in science of Physics and do it in a way that common viewer understands without too much of a dialog exposition is very hard. In movies we show the story not tell, therefor we try to avoid long explanations of things that normally we would want to see it visually and not listen to character explain them to us (unless you are Quentin Tarantino who loves long dialogs). This could be only criticism of this otherwise magnificent masterpiece that there is too much exposition explained using dialog. Then again considering the complexity of the story I do think Nolan did amazing job with what could have been overly intellectual approach to complex subjects. Work of Andrei Tarkovsky and Terrence Malick comes to mind watching the 'INTERSTELLAR' and to be compared to those three filmmakers including Kubrick it is a biggest complement 44 years old director could hope for. The acting is superb with Matthew McConaughey delivering very emotional portrait of a father on a mission to save the humanity but also his beloved daughter Murph played by both Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain respectively who push this epic story in to the importance of relationship between the father and daughter. This is where emotionally strength of 'INTERSTELLAR' lays. Anne Hathaway playing daughter professor Brand character played soulfully by Michael Caine also delivers one of her better performance being the intellectual counterbalance to more hands on approach of Matthew McConaughey's character. Caine constant reference to the poem by Dylan Tomas 'Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.' is nothing more then anthem against dying or passage of time that subsequently ends with our death. Nolan in it's complexity created the story that does not have a clear antagonist. The villain in this movie is TIME that takes away the precious moments between loved ones united by love that is the fuel for their actions. This is precisely why Nolan chose the planet Saturn as the planet where the wormhole is situated around which allowed our heroes venture on to the other part of the galaxy where the possibly habitable worlds resides for the whole humanity to be saved. In antiquity planet Saturn otherwise known as Kronos was the representation of time. This is why symbolically Saturn has such a prominent role in the 'INTERSTELLAR', it represents the time and material world our protagonist try to fight against. As I mentioned before I strongly feel that this film is one of the smartest piece of filmmaking in this decade and I applaud Nolan for challenging the audience to be thrown in to the beautifully emotional and intellectual at the same time 164 minutes long masterpiece, forever written on to the history of the cinema book as mighty 'INTERSTELLAR'. If you haven't deducted that from this review already, I am blown away by it and I think it will take another 10 years to made me experience another movie the way I've experienced the 'INTERSTELLAR'. Seeing it in IMAX is must for all the real cinema fans because this is what Christopher Nolan intended.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",10,2,7,14 November 2014
American Sniper," Highly touted Oscar contender that might indeed steal some statutes this year!
","I have been following the story of the sniper Chris Kyle, the Navy Seal credited with over 150 kills of the enemy combatants in the Middle East for quite some time. I knew that eventually there will be a movie made about his life, but I didn't expect to be so soon and with such a high profile director and cast. When I first heard that Clint Eastwood was interested to direct this project, I became doubly exited. I have a lot of respect for his work as an actor, who comfortably, in a twilight of his life, made a successful transition to become a film director. Eventually when it was reviled that Bradley Cooper will take upon himself the titled role, I was confident that the movie will turn out well. Cooper for his role needed to bulk up a bit and took Texan accent classes to be able to portrait Chris Kyle's life, in what eventually would end up as 'American Sniper' the movie. The whole film is based upon the book by Jason Hall and Chris Kyle spanning the period from childhood going all the way up to his training and 4 tours in Iraq, all the way to his unexpected (spoiler alert) death. The fact is that Chris Kyle was always a controversial figure. To some he was a hero and a patriot of the highest caliber, to others he was an enemy who had a bounty put on his head in the amount of $20.000. Even known American politician Ron Paul got in to hot water by controversially stating comment about Kyle's life in motto: 'Who fight with a sword dies from it'. However the opinion about the man himself, the fact is, that his life story does work as a movie and the 'American Sniper' receiving many Oscar nominations this year including Best Film and Best Leading Actor for Bradley Cooper is the best testament of that.The first thing that you notice about this film is the fact that it is 2 hours and 13th minutes long. This time allowed Eastwood to develop the story without rushing through important moments of Kyle's life, starting from his childhood, going through his bull - rodeo riding, all the way through his enrollment at the age of 30, on to the Navy Seal training regiment and his 4 tours in Iraq. Of course as with most military veterans the adjustment to a normal life becomes a problem. Many veterans suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) which Kyle was trying to help and by doing so helping himself.The way the story is constructed in the movie is that Eastwood concentrates on the central conflict between the two world class snipers. One of them being Kyle, the other is a Syrian based terrorist who has Olympic pedigree in rifle shots, who fights on the side of the insurgents in Fallujah, a city in the Iraqi province of Al Anbar which has been a terrorist hotbed of insurgency. As US Marines conduct door to door search Kyle is their eye in the elevated position, that protects them in case of problems. This creates a legendary celebrity like status among his fellow soldiers. Watching 'American Sniper' another Oscar worthy movie with similar subject comes to mind titled 'Hurt Locker'. Specially the fact that soldiers have a difficulty in adopting to their life back in the civil circumstances and that makes them want to come back to the battlefield, because only there they feel like they are really alive.Personally I felt 'American Sniper' was bit too long and lack the emotional impact which I expected from the material presented here. Don't understand me wrong it is still a great film. All the performances are very solid, starting from Bradley Cooper, who not only transform physically, but also has the natural charisma and likability of a leader on display. I am not sure however if this is indeed his best performance. Sienna Miller seems to be on a row and to some extent being type cast again by playing his wife, being also casted as a wife of Mark Ruffalo's character in the 'Foxcatcher', another highly Oscar touted movie this year. There were scenes in 'American Sniper' which I felt were unnecessary or simply too long, but they were not distracting enough to take me out of the cinematic experience. On personal note I was really proud to see one of my Ivana Chubbuck Studio acting buddies Evan Gamble, whom I work with in the past, getting an opportunity to have a small speaking role with Bradley Cooper. All in all this highly touted Oscar contender might indeed steal some statuettes this year and rightfully so, I just wish that it would have been at least 15 minutes shorter, which would help to speed up the tempo of the film.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",9,8,25,16 January 2015
Southpaw," You might feel that 'Southpaw' is full of clichés and been there done that mind frame and to be quite honest you would be right.
","I will state it upfront that I will be extra hard in my review of 'Southpaw' the new boxing movie directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen), let me explain why. I am a student of the 'Sweet Science' as boxing is called in pugilist circles, for over 19 years now. I am a hardcore fan of boxing and follow what is happening in this sport everyday visiting boxing websites. I watch every major boxing fight of the last 20 years and thousands of mediocre ones as well. You name a fighter in the past two decades and I probably saw him fighting, know his record and I will be able to name five top opponents he faced in his career. I witnessed career of Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya, and other top pound for pound fighters with almost religious devotion. I am also a student of the history of boxing going all the way back to boxers like Jack Jonson, Joe Lewis and Rocky Marciano. Apart of being a fan I also train boxing. In my home I had a punch bag and speed bag and when I go to the gym I always start with boxing workout consisting of shadow boxing, and sessions on Heavy and Soft bags. I am aware of boxing techniques, leg movement and defensive techniques. Bottom line boxing is a sport I have been obsessed with for the last two decades. This is why I am always extra excited and hard when I hear about a new boxing movie which will be released to the mainstream. Whenever you have such devotion to one sport it is almost sacrilegious feeling when boxing is not depicted in correct or believable way. This brings us to the new installment in boxing movies tradition which saw many wonderful attempts to show the reality of the sport as well many failures. 'Southpaw' falls somewhere between this category. Billy 'The Great' Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), the reigning junior middleweight boxing champion, has an impressive career, a loving wife and daughter, and a lavish lifestyle. However, when tragedy strikes, Billy hits rock bottom, losing his family, his house and his manager. He soon finds an unlikely savior in Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker), a former fighter who trains the city's toughest amateur boxers. With his future on the line, Hope fights to reclaim the trust of those he loves the most. I must say when you read this premiss you might feel that it is full of clichés and been there done that mind frame and to be quite honest you would be right. This type of redemption stories has been done before and to better effect. There is nothing overly unique about it. With lesser director this film would be just another corny Rocky wanna be but by adding Jake Gyllenhaal and his acting craft, this potentially mediocre film raised beyond the level it was heading to. Originally 'Southpaw' was supposed to be a follow up to Eminem's 8 Mile with Slim Shady resuming the titled role. Thankfully he decided to focus on the music department of the movie and left acting to the professional and let me tell you Jake did fine job portraying a boxer. Specially the out of the ring aspect. His physique is ripped and many months he spent in Wild Card Gym of Hall of Fame trainer Freddie Roach, one of the best in the world, paid off. Watching fighters like Manny Pacquiao and Miguel Cotto made a difference in the way he prepared for this role. Usually when it comes to boxing movies the biggest problem actors have is with footwork. It is where boxers generate power from. Without good footwork you can not box effectively and it takes a long time before moving around the ring becomes second nature. Jakes footwork was decent which allowed him to build up on the rest of the boxing technique. The actual fights might not be as well choreographed or shot as in lets say 'Raging Bull' masterpiece of Martin Scorsese arguably the best boxing movie ever made. To elaborate on outside boxing issues the story feels very predictable you can almost guess how the movie will end half way through. The other notable performances are led by Forest Whitaker as the washed up trainer though his performance might be largely overlooked because it feels inconsistent. I could dissect the rest of the cast but let me summarize this in one sentence. This film without Jake and good director would be mediocre. Even the title sounds like a gimmick. The title of the film is a reference to the eponymous stance traditionally adopted by a left handed boxer. As previous Rocky movies Jakes character learns as an orthodox fighter to switch to lefty to surprise his big nemesis. This is only one of the clichés I am talking about. If you are not a boxing fan I do think you might be swept by the drama of the story and you will root for the underdog but if you have understanding of the fight game you will be fidgeting uncomfortably and will have half backed smirk on your face and it won't be because you think what you are seeing on the screen is realistic depiction of Sweet Science. 'Southpaw' isn't a bad film by any means but it is not a new Rocky, where with Stallone you could feel that he was a student of the game, this film feels like a dramatization of events which we've seen over and over in the past.",7,1,3,5 August 2015
Nightcrawler," 'Nightcrawler' is a good thriller which can be recommended for a lovers of a fast paced thrill seeking cinema.
","The fact is that motivation to succeed can be a powerful drive to make something out of ourself in this life. In America, the land of opportunity, in densely pact, excessively rich and extremely poor population of L.A, divided only by neighborhoods that sometime resemble ghettos, especially in downtown area, some people will go an extra mille to put themselves in the position to succeed at all cost. That ambition can be truly dangerous whenever the individual lacks a moral backbone. Add to it, a sociopathic personality disorder and you've got a recipe for disaster. Louis Bloom the protagonist of the thriller the 'Nightcrawler' displays all above mentioned characteristics. He is extremely ambitious and morally distorted which allowed him to pursue one of the most looked down up on professions in news broadcasting industry. He becomes a Nightcrawler mixture of paparazzi and investigative reporter which investigates all the major crime scenes in search of the footage, that can be sold to TV news companies that are interested in this sort of material. 'Louis (Jake Gyllenhaal) starts a freelance camera crew who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, he muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling -- where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Nina (Rene Russo), a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou thrives. In the breakneck, ceaseless search for footage, he becomes the star of his own story''Nightcrawler' is a directorial debut of the screenwriter husband of Rene Russo, Dan Gilroy. Being born in L.A, Gilroy clearly understands this town better then most people. The amount of people who come to Hollywood to become famous at all cost is staggering. I use to live in Los Angeles and being a night owl I liked driving through the empty streets of L.A without a traffic at night. During the night time there is a sense of peace and calm that usually turns in to chaos and traffic jams during the day. Of course there are neighborhoods which are dangerous to drive around specially at night and it takes someone with a death wish to really push their luck. Apparently Jake Gyllenhaal lost 20 pounds to play Louis Bloom and this might have been bit of a marketing ploy by the producers to give an extra attention to dramatic weight loss which was not really needed for the development of the character. Watching his performance another great character comes to mind Travis Bickle played to perfection by Bob DeNiro in Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'. Both character are lonely individuals that want to do something with their life. Perhaps Louis Bloom has a better vocabulary and is able to express his thoughts well in sort of intellectual vocabulary diarrhea that gets him often the things he wants. Taking the gimmicky weight loss aside I must say Jake delivers one of his better characterizations full of moments that make his character transform in to a sociopathic individual who want to succeed at all cost. The relationship between him and his news producer played by still beautiful Rene Russo is full of sexuality which often is a driving force behind most successful performances. I don't know if his performance is good enough to receive a nomination for an Oscar next year, but it is captivating and entertaining enough to justify the price of the ticket. In 'Nightcrawler' writer/director asks a lot of interesting moral questions about why our society is so focused on negativity and drives us towards stories of murder and tragedies that are shown on TV. Apparently the negative type of news take upon the highest amount of screening time in every TV station. Why do TV stations compete to bring the most vicious crimes on to out TV sets? Are we a part of the problem? Is our society so desensitized that the only thing that can interest the mass audience are bloodthirsty tragedies that most people fill up their heads with? Sadly the answer might be resounding YES whether we like it or not. Our morbid fascination with crime, does not put forth peaceful future for our children, but for the time being might become a source of entertainment whether we want to admit that or not. Precisely that is what Dan Gilroy explores in his movie and by identifying with the protagonist he forces the audience to think deeply about their moral compass and willingness to succeed at all costs. 'Nightcrawler' is a good thriller which can be recommended for the lovers of a fast paced thrill seeking cinema.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",8,0,2,4 November 2014
Divergent," Another movie with a similar premiss this time based on a trilogy by Veronica Roth that hopes to be develop in to a franchise.
","Another movie with a similar premiss this time based on a trilogy by Veronica Roth that hopes to be develop in to a franchise. 'In a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she's Divergent and won't fit in. When she discovers a plot to destroy Divergents, Tris and the mysterious Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late.' Lets be honest act two is practically non existent here with story that seems to not really developed well. 'Divergent' is a mixture of 'Hunger Games', 'The Host' with elements of 'Ender's Game'. The whole time as the audience we are waiting for a story to take a bigger, more epic dimension but it does not go there. It is all introduction, but were in 'Hunger Games' we bond with all the characters, here we feel indifferent and that is not good. The climax feels not well executed story wise. The romance element works well but ultimately is not enough in full spectrum of the films otherwise flat s/f movie to safe it. The acting performances are solid but the material here is not very challenging for someone like Ashley Judd to give the best of herself. There is some symbology here after nuclear war the rest of humanity is divided in to 5 fractions symbolizing virtues but indirectly 5 elements including ' Aether' the spirit/life force that connects all the other elements together. By you choosing one of the fractions you choose to live your life according to it's doctrine. Being 'Divergent' is not being able to fit to non of the fractions and therefore being automatically excluded out of the perfect public ecosystem. The premise seems to be more appealing then the actual execution. 'Divergent' can comfortably be a DVD rental. Bottom line there were other movies with similar concepts which were better executed.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",5,1,3,25 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Chase scene in Morocco being one of the best in cinema history and I include 'Ronin', 'The French Connection' as well as 'Bourne Identity'
","People complain about Tom Cruise, saying he is short, scientology obsessed and extremely self- absorbed. His believe system which made him unpopular with mainstream public for a long period of time seems working for him. I personally have different opinion on why he is associated with Scientology Cult and knowing that in the past he wanted to be a Christian Catholic priest his role in church of L. Ron Hubbard might be more of a infiltration agent than anything else. But then again only Tom knows that and his handlers. He is arguably the biggest movie star in the world and with being the best comes the unpleasant part, you need to allow others to project their anxieties on you. This is what entertainers are for. They are here so that we as the audience can love them or hate them depending on the role they play. Everything is cyclical and Hollywood loves to love their stars until they hate them, then they feel guilty that they hate them and they start to love them again. Tom does extraordinary things. In CGI world of filmmaking, he does almost all his stunts insisting in pushing the boundaries more and more every movie he makes. He is also power player being producer on most of his movies which allows him to have a say which actor or director will be hired for his movies. The Mission Impossible franchise has had it's ups and downs. Each part has been directed by different director therefor often stylistically there are clear differences in direction each movie took. From Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird to now Christopher McQuarrie creator of highly successful 'Jack Reacher' movie which sure will turn to another franchise for Tom. Believe it or not but it is his only 3rd feature film he ever directed previously mostly resuming a role of a writer on movies like 'Edge of Tomorrow', 'Jack Reacher' and 'Valkyrie'. As a writer he possesses very good understanding of human inner make up and what motivates characters to make their relationship work on the silver screen. By doing so he creates very believable relationships that push the plot forward. I do not want to jump the gun here but there I will say it, 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' might be the best of all the movies from this franchise and that tells a lot about it. Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF.The action is overwhelming with a chase scene in Morocco being one of the best in cinema history and I include 'Ronin', 'The French Connection' as well as 'Bourne Identity'. Every movie needs a good antagonist and after 'Deliver Us from Evil' Sean Harris was a choice that seems perfect for highly mysterious villain Solomon Lane. As a leader of mysterious group Syndicate he creates order out of chaos. It is funny that both movies MI and the new James Bond movie 'Spectre' are both telling a story of mysterious organization that from behind the curtain rules the world by creating conflicts, terroristic attacks that in the end are taking power over the elite politicians and power players to create the New World Order of the world. This mystical organization in real life is called the ILLUMINATI and started back in 1st of May 1776 in Bavaria by Adam Weishaupt and his associates. Of course the mainstream history and media will tell us that this organization has been dissolved and yet they are responsible for French Revolution as well as spread of Communism as a counter ideology towards a fight with Capitalism. Bottom line this film as well as the new James Bond are bringing some new information about this mysterious organization disguised some real facts with fictional disinformation techniques Hollywood is so good at spreading. To come back to the review 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is truly spectacular piece of entertainment. As I mentioned already the action is breathtaking together with stunning stunt by Tom in the opening of the movie. The performances are great from everyone involved and seems deeper than the previous installments. Bottom line is whatever are your personal feelings about Tom Cruise as a person this should not detract from the fact that he is very charismatic lead and when it comes to 'Mission: Impossible' movies this franchise is in safe hands. I highly recommend this film to the lovers of fast paced smart action films.For more of my reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",10,0,2,4 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Once again director Bryan Singer delivered goods in arguably the greatest X-MEN movie to date in the 'X-MEN Days of Future Past'!
","Once again director Bryan Singer delivered goods in arguably the greatest X-MEN movie to date in the 'X- MEN Days of Future Past'! Yes indeed, this installment feels like a bridge between the characters and their stories in the past and the future. Made with the estimated budget of $250,000,000 this film needs to make 3 times its cost to be profitable. $750,000,000 to be exact, or more and I believe, judging by an early reviews, it will be one of the most profitable movies of this year. Everything is bigger and better here in all departments. This is the best of Wolverine we've have ever seen. Finely Jackman grew in to his character he embodied in the passed, however now less with rage more so with brute, masculine strength. His veins are practically popping out everywhere on his body. But just because Wolverine has an important part in this story doesn't mean that he hijacked the whole movie in terms of the performance. All the lead actors in their super hero characteristics bring something unique to the table in terms of charisma, otherwise they wouldn't have been casted in the first place, but in 'X-MEN Days of Future Past' Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg and writer of the story Jane Goldman let other lesser known X-MEN take the stage in the battle for the future of all men kind and mutants. The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The characters from the original X-Men film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle that must change the past - to save our future. The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. There is a lot to like here in terms of character development from all the actors both in the past as well as the future. Apart from the old characters we know form the previous films like Wolverine/ Hugh Jackman, Professor X/Patrick Stewart, Magnito/Ian McKellen, Storm/Halle Berry we have a newcomers like Nicholas Hoult playing the Beast and of course Michael Fassbender playing Erik Lehnsherr the younger version of Magnito end emotional James McAvoy as the young and still walking Charles Xavier. Next to Jackman person who quietly steals the movie for me is Raven / Mystique Jennifer Lawrence who practically steals every scene she is in, not only because most of the story plot depends on her character path being good or turning bad or that she is practically naked not counting the blue tight costume she embodies, but in this film we see more of her inner self that till now was not so overexposed. In 1973 her blood will be used to create special robotic machines made by men called the Sentinels that 50 years from then will be the deciding apocalyptic point of the extinction of the world as we know it. The balance between both time frames is handled very well here and keeps viewer in constant state of entertainment in terms of character development going back and forward respectively. I think all the little historical references like Magnito's jail arrest in Pentagon for being accused of killing JFK, or scenes with president Richard Nixon as an example, give the whole story, the additional dimension of historical reference making it more enjoyable and original. The action scenes are full of CGI, but it looks like the money here was spend well, due to the impressive visual scope. Specially the scene of the breakout of Magneto from the Pentagon by our heroes, including the new super fast mutant by the name of Quicksilver (comedically refreshing Evan Peters). That scene is shot brilliantly is super slow-motion were director Bryan Singer filmed Quicksilver's scenes in a special format of 3600 frames a minute. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 1500 times faster than normal running around the room disarming people in instant. Awesome! That scene in itself is worth the 3D admission ticked! From what I have read Bryan Singer will both direct and produce another X-MEN movie set to start production in 2016 titled 'X-Men: Apocalypse'. From the quality of this X-MEN installment I reckon this franchise is in good hands.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",9,4,9,21 May 2014
Inside Out," Might be nominated for an Oscar in the category of a Best Picture.
","Some movies bring out the child inside us. Doesn't matter if you are 9, 23 or 49 we all like to forget our daily struggle and be transferred into the world of make believe. It is even better when after the ending of the film we are still emotionally invested with the characters we saw on the screen. It is mind blowing however when these characters are animated and the movie is the 15th feature film of the company known for their excellence in delivering deep enjoyable animated films, which in some way became the benchmark of animation around the world. Pixar as a team, truly outdid themselves this time creating arguably one of their best feature films with 'INSIDE OUT'. With a blend of education and entertainment they created truly enjoyable experience which lasts much longer after the initial viewing. The premise is very simple and the actual plot can be easily explained with a so called 'elevator pitch'. 'After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.' Under this simple premise a deeper complex psychological story is hidden in plane sight. In fact this film might be the most deep and sometime darkest of Pixar's creations, because it deals with the human psychology and emotions which occur in us all. By lowering the count from the original 27 emotions and keeping the choice to 5, using, Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness, Pixar's team created very clear pattern of behavior where our characters operate. This story has two dimensionality because it takes place in normal life and inside our protagonist head. The stimuli of her life experiences are translated towards which emotions are dominating at the particular time. I do not want to give away to much in terms of the twists and turn of the plot, but I can insure you, you will laugh out loud and certainly share a tear or two. The characters created here are extremely endearing and in fact this story does not have really an antagonist. It could be argued that the antagonist in 'INSIDE OUT' is the environment which becomes the catalysator that starts the change in Ridley's life. Her memories are changing and she in some way moves on to another chapter in her life that is much more mature. The most important moral of this story is that it is OK to be sad and sometimes all human being needs is to have a good cry that releases those inner emotions that are bottled up inside us. After we do that, we feel a sense of peace and calm. All the voice-over actors do a splendid job in adding the extra layer of believability to wonderfully detailed CGI animations giving them much needed soul. As I mentioned before it is a very simple story and yet the execution is of an epic proportions. Pixar's ability to entertain us and sometimes move us to tears is second to non. This is truly one of the best feature films they created and it has been made with only half of the normal team. The production design took 5 years to be prepared therefor there is nothing random here. Everything has it's psychological backing which ads to the masterful, meticulous way this film has been created with. If you have little kids then take them to see 'INSIDE OUT' it's a no brainer. If you are not a child no more, but you would like to be brought back in to your childhood, there is no better movie this summer to accomplish that then 'INSIDE OUT'. I already heard some rumors that this film might be nominated for an Oscar in the category of a Best Picture and why not. This amount of entertainment, depth and psychological education deserves the highest praise. I guaranty you will love 'INSIDE OUT'. Go and check it out in 3D.",Null,4,24,7 July 2015
Foxcatcher," Steve Carell's minimalistic performance is indeed Oscar worthy!
","Ever since I saw the first trailer, I had a very high, Oscar worthy expectations for this slow, but intense wrestling biopic drama the 'Foxcatcher'. There is a sense of underlined intensity throughout this film, that leads us to believe that the end might culminate in a violent crescendo as it indeed does.'When wealthy John du Pont (Steve Carell) invites Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) to move to his estate and help form a wrestling team for the 1988 Olympics, Mark sees a way to step out of the shadow of his charismatic brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). However, du Pont begins to lead Mark down a dark road, causing the athlete's self-esteem to slip. Meanwhile, du Pont becomes fixated on bringing Dave into the fold, eventually propelling all three toward an unforeseen tragedy.'In 'Foxcatcher' the whole wrestling competition has a very heavy homo erotic undertone about it. Specially in the retrospect of the relationship between John du Pont and Mark Schultz. One is trying to be a father figure the other looking for guidance. As the film progresses there is something darker that develops between the two man, which will explain almost jealous like behavior of John du Pont towards his brother Dave and their relationship. On the other hand the fact that Mark lost his family when he was 2 years old made him be fully dependent on his older brother Dave. We can see the bond between them two being tested, when wealthy blue blood du Pont, decides to invite them both to his Foxcatcher a state, where he offers them a perfect training environment. However nothing comes free in this world and as the film progresses, the pressure on Mark to be the best and come out of his older brother shadow takes painful tool on his mental health. The whole movie feels like a tour the force of those 3 actors. Both Ruffalo and Tatum went through 6 months long grueling wrestling training and indeed look the part. Both concentrated on body language and type of walk that truly transforms them on to this real life characters that seems to be removed from their actual film star persona. The biggest highlight however and to some extant surprise is the performance of comedian Steve Carell. His minimalistic performance is indeed Oscar worthy. Behind all the prosthetics, he actually developed a speech pattern and a way of breading which controls the speed of delivering lines. In 'Foxcatcher' he is a super wealthy man who does not need to talk fast. Psychologically his relationship with his mother is interesting. He is looking for approval from her, always feeling like he disappoints her by engaging in a wrestling sport, which she feels is way too common for someone of his social statue. On paper 'Foxcatcher' looks like sure Oscar bet, however there is a problem in this movie and namely with the timing. Among many other things the job of a good director is to be able to maintain the timing of the lines between the characters which creates the illusion of reality. Big part of that, can be created in editing but sometimes when actors take a little bit too much time for their thought process in between their lines, the whole scene can loose it's tempo which happens here all the time. By doing so, when tempo of the movie gets slowed down the whole movie looses its intensity and audiences interest. That is a pity indeed because this film had a huge potential to be truly exceptional. I also think that music and specially sound design should have been used to a better effect. I am happy for Steve Carell that he was able to showcase his dramatic side in this film. He has been rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his role. I only wish that the whole film would have been made a little bit better, raising it form a good level to a great one. It is all about fulfilling it's potential which 'Foxcatcher' fully did not. I might be bit hard on 'Foxcatcher' in this review, but when you've expected great things and you have to subtle, the enjoyment of the viewing experience can sometime leave something to be desired. 'Foxcatcher' is still worth the cinema admission ticked though.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",8,3,9,15 January 2015
It Follows," IT FOLLOWS is not your typical horror. Here the style dictates the substance.
","Whenever you hear about an independent horror movie with a very humble budget of $2 million that is being thought as the best independent horror of the year, it always gets me worried. My expectation get so big that I often get disappointed with the outcome. I had this with James Wan's 'The Conjuring' which news from early screenings were so optimistic that the movie was pushed forward to premiere during better, more viewers friendly time of of the year. The film was OK, but far from horror masterpiece like 'INSIDIOUS', which on the other hand was wonderfully surprisingly excellent in it's own right. Director David Robert Mitchell with his stylish scary movie 'IT FOLLOWS' decided to bring a new twist in the horror genre. The concept of sexually transmitted haunting has never been done to my knowledge. For nineteen-year-old Jay, Autumn should be about school, boys and week-ends out at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual encounter, she finds herself plagued by strange visions and the inescapable sense that someone, something, is following her. Faced with this burden, Jay and her friends must find a way to escape the horrors that seem to be only a few steps behind.By clearly using an inspiration from directors like Carpenter, Mitchell's vision is full of 80's electronic music with long panning shots that often are the master shots of the scenes. The camera is spinning on its axes as we always wonder if something is not hiding in the shadows, or indeed following the characters. This is where the strength of this film lays, it's suspense. And not the cheap, corny kind, but sometime borderline stylistic homage giving to filmmakers like Kubrick and his horror masterpiece 'The Shining'. There are clear moments that brings to mind this timeless classic, even things like sound design and music which is stylistically used in a very suspenseful way. Indeed perhaps this the best way to describe this film is that is suspenseful. If it is gore you are after, then this film will not be to your satisfaction, there is very little of it. Not counting the opening sequence, that is. In fact perhaps is not right to call IT FOLLOWS a horror, its more of a dark, suspense thriller. Now, that means that there are spots of frights spread around in the story but sometime in between we might feel bit disconnected from the story, though the performances are solid specially from Maika Monroe playing 'infected' Jay Height. This film has often slow and individual passing. Very meditative with above mentioned slow panning dolly shots creates moody stylistic throwback to horrors of 60's, 70's and specially 80's. This might not be to everyone liking, I personally liked it a lot. Is this the best horror film of the year? ...not too sure about that. Is it worth checking out?... most definitely, specially if you've been looking for something suspenseful and scary. But be prepared IT FOLLOWS is not your typical horror. Here the style dictates the substance.",8,71,143,17 April 2015
Gone Girl," 'Gone Girl' is a refreshing breath of fresh air, through perspective on genre that needed oxygen for quite some time.
","Whenever I hear a rumors about an Oscar contention about a movie that I haven't seen it yet and I do not feel any type of interest after watching a trailer, I always come to a screening unsure what to expect and often my assumption is, that probably I will not like the movie. Specially if two main actors playing the leads do not belong to the group of actors I normally would spend the money to see. Mostly mainstream entertainment can be quite shallow, directed to mass audience which often is interested in form of easy going escapism rather then intellectual pursuit. I knew that 'Gone Girl' was directed by David Fincher, director whom I deeply admire for his body of work, but anyone can have a bad day or a movie in his case. Fincher started in the commercial world and was known for his unique sense of visually narrative style that eventually translated in to a big Hollywood feature film career, arguably becoming top 5 best director in the business. Ben Affleck on the other hand is not my cup of tea. I always felt that he is overrated as an actor (his brother Casey Affleck in my opinion is much better actor) but got a second chance as a director and I think that is were he can develop further considering his earlier directorial success with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and specially Oscar winning Argo. Based on the casting alone I really thought that I will hate 'Gone Girl' but how wrong was I. I underestimated intelligence of David Fincher and his understanding of the fact that movies are made in casting. What I mean by that, is that if you hire suitable actors to play a characters that in some way might be a part of who they are in real life they will be able to bring that persona to life and create a performances that are not forced, but rooted in truth, honed by the director who slowly becomes observer instead a parent figure that has to teach them how to act, or safe their performance in editing room. Rosamond Pike might get the nomination. The fact of her giving up on her vanity will help with that.'On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?'To be accurate with assessment of this film one word can describe in detail and that is SMART. Yes indeed!!! For movie that is 150 minutes long and you enjoy every minute of it, in fact you want more, that is success in itself. I will not write in-depth about the twists and turns of the story to not spoil the experience for you, but all I will say is that 'Gone Girl' is arguably the smartest and most complex character driven story of this year and if that is not worth the Oscar contention then I don't know what is... The acting is superb from all the ensemble, developing reach and multi layered characterizations, staring with snobby yet charming Rosamund Pike who shows her dimensions in more way then one, possibly stealing the movie (and maybe getting Oscar contention in the process) in terms of performance. The support cast shines too but only serving the purpose of helping to unveil the complex story.David Fincher's directorial taste needs to be credited with handling some of the most intense scenes with doze of huge technical know how using sound design and editing pacing of how to stimulate the senses of the audience without venturing in to the territory of the a bad taste. And indeed Fincher might be as Alfred Hitchcock 50 years before him a king of knowing how to build up a tension without reviling to much and keeping the audience guessing till the final scene. Big credit should also go to the editor Kirk Baxter who lets the scenes just run enough and stops them almost before most editors would, creating sense of anticipation and hight state of tension. This is why the pacing is just right and in general you can see that Fincher has a musical ear having music video background. By watching 'Gone Girl' another Fincher's movie comes to mind The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which is a remake of 2009 Swedish drama thriller based on the novel of the same name by Swedish author/journalist Stieg Larsson (Män som hatar kvinnor – literally – Men who hate women) Indeed both films have a lot in common and that is the antipathy towards women. I don't know Fincher's family life, but judging from the movies he is selecting he might have some scorn towards female kind. Judgment aside 'Gone Girl' is truly a movie that will surprise you and make you wonder were is the story going in the age of remakes and scripts written by the numbers. It is a refreshing breath of fresh air, through perspective on genre that needed oxygen for quite some time.For more of my film reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",10,1,12,5 October 2014
1917," It's the way the story is told, that truly permits the audience to immerse themselves in this WWI epic.
","My review of '1917'.
There are very few movies which successfully pull off illusion of being shot in one continues take.
Alfred Hitchcock's 'ROPE' (1948) comes to mind, as well as the opening shot of Orson Wellse's 'Touch of Evil' (1958). More recently 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' (2014) directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu earned the best Picture and best Director among other categories back in 2015, which shows how much the Academy appreciates this stylistic yet technically difficult choice of story exposition.
By now everyone knows that Sam Mendes's '1917' has yearned the Golden Globe for best film and before seeing it I was bit unsure of this choice leaning towards 'JOKER' as the best movie of the year. Potentially Mende's movie has all the ingredients to be special. First, an acclaimed director in Sam Mendes, second arguably the best director of photography who paints with light in Roger Deakins, the budget of close to 100mil, so what could go wrong? Well perhaps setting a challenge of trying to convey movies full story in real time using what appears to be one continues take.
Magician does not explains how he achieved particular trick same as filmmaker usually doesn't show how he created film sequence. By doing so, he is demystifying the process which should only be known to the initiated. However there are widely available online behind the scenes footage, where both director as well as DP explain the challenges of creating whole movie using continues tracking shoot, which follows two protagonists who are Lance Corporal Blake played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay playing Lance Corpal Schofied. Both young army man during the First World War are given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. As the story unfolds we are following them through the trenches and obstacles trying to fiulfil their mission.
At first when I though that this movie will be shown in real time using continues take with edits hidden in wipes (movement of the camera which lingers on wall or other objects permitting seamlessly to connect two scenes together in editing making it look as one continues take) I was unsure. When I first heard that '1917' employed this technique I feared that it might be used as gimmick, however when I find out that Roger Deakens is involved in the project I knew Sam Medes's picture was in good hands. Most people will not understand how much work it takes to create movie this way. The control of focus and the light alone is a very difficult task. However if one take tracking shot technique isn't used for the narrative purpose, then whole film potentially could fail. That's where Sam Mendes directing comes in to play, who also co-wrote the screenplay which he based on a very personal story of his grandfather's experiences in WWI titled'The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991'.
Sam Mendes is a special director, we could point to many movies which prove this argument. From 'American Beauty' to my favourite Bond to date in 'Skyfall'. He is a director who is able to convey emotion, without being overly dramatic. There is a subtleness within which he is able to covey inner emotions of the character by using not only actors performance, but utilising blocking (movement of actors in relation to camera) in a landscape scope of the composition. Film of this sort only works if the audience truly feels like they are on a journey together with our protagonists and big credit for doing so needs to be given to musical score which is used to convey danger, emotionality and melancholy when needed.
The reason why this film works is because all of the above mentioned techniques are utilised to tell the story and forward the narration to an emotional impact on the viewer. Yes, the performances are strong, with cameos from Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and charismatic as always Mark Strong, not to mention both leads, but it's the way the story is told, that truly permits the audience to immerse themselves in this WWI epic. After watching '1917' I can honestly say, I strongly believe this picture will receive an OSCAR's for the best film and cinematography (in any other year I would pick the 'JOKER' for the best film and cinematography, but this year Roger Deakens should not be denied) and possibly Sam Mendes for having an overview over all these elements, to create arguably best movie of the year, which up to that point this distinction belong in my humble opinion to the 'JOKER'. I strongly feel Sam Mendes has made his grandfather very proud, in his attempt to bring all the creative pieces together, creating in it's entirety a masterpiece of a movie, which film students will study for years to come.",10,5,8,12 January 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a testament to how far the film industry has gone since the days of model building and rudimentary special FX
","What a rush...!!! Is the best way to describe the new Marvel visual extravaganza titled 'Guardians of the Galaxy'! My senses are still tingling and It took me a while to be able to unplugged from the theater of the make believe but the satisfaction I feel right now makes me confident that I saw something very special. In fact I just might have seen 'STAR WARS' like experience of this generation. I was asked once by the outsider to the film industry, why only Hollywood studios are capable of bringing the big CGI supported action Blockbusters? Why Europa is incapable of making this type of movies? What does that depend on? Don't we have the talent to create similar type big and to some extant epic movies? The answer is very simple and the best example to prove my point we can go no further then 'Cloud Atlas' which back in 2012 was made for 102 million dollars by few German based production companies. Despite of the fact that I thought 'Cloud Atlas' was a very well made movie (minus not always believable make up) and carried a depth that is often missing from their American counterparts. It failed miserably at the box office bringing total of 27 million dollars. The fact that it was treated as a art-house film and was shown in small screening rooms did not help in it's all around success. It is not that European companies are incapable of making big blockbusters (a lot of big American movies are often shot at the European studios like Pinewood in UK, for example) it is just very risky to do so. One flop can mean the end of that studio, where in Hollywood exists more of a factory type mechanism were big movies are being planed years in advance and if some movie ends up not making as much money for the studio, month or two later there is a next blockbuster premier that hopefully make up the financial difference. This brings us to this summers awesome representation of what we love in Hollywood movies 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Based on the Marvel comic book released back in 70's, with considerably less known characters comparing with Iron Man, Batman or Spiderman, among others. The premise is straight forward.After stealing a mysterious orb in the far reaches of outer space, human Peter Quill (bulked up Chris Pratt) is now the main target of a manhunt led by the villain known as Ronan the Accuser (charismatic Lee Pace). To help fight Ronan and his team and SAVE the galaxy from his power, Quill creates a team known as the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' to save the world.This team consist of: Sexy female assassin Gamora (hot Zoe Saldana) Overgrown muscle man trying to avenge his families death, Drax (surpassingly emotionally deep performance by the WWE wrestler Dave Bautista) and two CGI creations: Groot (Vin Diesel) and Bradley Cooper as Rocket.Together they create 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Group of misfits, losers, and very unlikely heroes that are put in the position, were they have to extend themselves beyond what they normally are capable off.Most audiences as a rule often like to share their support with the underdog and trust me there are no bigger underdogs then this bunch and perhaps this is were the strength of the movie lies. We want them to succeed. Mostly they are motivated by pain and loss of a loved one. As an example Chris Pratt's character as a child looses mother to cancer and after being abducted from Earth by cosmic bounty hunters, his feelings intensifies of wanting to make something out of himself to become a legend, a self-proclaimed Star-Lord. Chris Pratt natural comedic taming and bravado fits perfectly with this character, who uses humor as a form of protection from dark thoughts which pollute his psyche. The balance between comedy and action is handled superbly by director James Gunn who is also co-writter of the script. Plenty of smart remarks made by characters create very enjoyable roller coaster of vocabulary choices which often bring loud laughter from the audience. My favorite was an exchange between Gamora and Peter Quill. Gamora: And by the way... Your ship is filthy. Peter Quill: Filthy? She has no idea. If we had a blacklight, it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.The production design, but specially costume and make up design is so detailed and perfect in its construct, that all of the art design helps creating a Universe that we loose ourselves in, completely. It is truly Oscar worthy work, no doubt about it. The action scenes are breathtaking kinetically and auditory wise and I almost guaranty that you will want to see 'Guardians of the Galaxy' again to make sure that you had an opportunity to catch all the details that often overwhelm our senses during the first viewing. There is so much to experience here.This film is a testament to how far the film industry has gone since the days of model building and rudimentary special FX that started with Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis'(1927), long before '2001: Space Odyssey' (1968) and continued through 'STAR WARS' franchise till this day. I take my hat off to the Hollywood filmmakers who created this arguably the most visually interesting movie of the decade and bunch of interesting and sometimes silly and other times cocky characters unseen on the Silver screen since the days of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. I loved 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and I am pretty sure that you and your family will too. Go and check this one out, specially in 3D if you can.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",10,1,3,8 August 2014
Joker," 'JOKER' is a mental illness study wrapped up in arthouse execution.
","As a filmmaker is it ok to be inspired by other films? Absolutely, It happens all the time.What if as a director your homage to particular movies is very obvious? As long as he makes it his own stylistically, it's all forgiven.'Good artist borrow, Great artist steal' quote comes to mind.
Whenever you have whole scenes basically copied from previous movies, thats when more mature audience might feel bit cheated because they associate them with movies from the past. However if you find way of original delivery of these ideas you might struck an emotional gold with the audiences as it happened in this case.The first thing you notice as Todd Phillips's 'JOKER' begins is its 1.85 : 1 aspect ratio, different then the CinemaScope
2.35 : 1 standard widescreen ratio which often is being used on big franchise superhero films, that gives the movie more cinematic feel. This choice alone signalises to the audience that they are watching a superhero movie unlike any other which came before it. One that is stylistically tilted towards Arthouse cinema narrating style, instead of typical standard CGI big budget blockbuster.'JOKER' is a story of the origin, told as a character study with everything in it screams quality.
In essence it is a film of two half's.
First half of the film is based on character development which is drama based, where we are getting to know our protagonist/anti-hero. The second half of the film turns to a thriller when Arthur Fleck titled JOKER, decides to take his revenge on the people who mistreated him in the past. Its very easy to see parallels between JOKER and other movies like 'Taxi driver' (1976) and 'The King of Comedy' (1982) directed by Martin Scorsese.
Deliberate choice of casting Robert DeNiro as Murray Franklin a chat show host Artur looks up to is for mature audience clear bow towards both Scorsese movies I mentioned. Todd Phillips is very transparent with that, perhaps too transparent. Once again, its ok to pay homage to films from the past, however when you are trying to copy the whole scenes, you need to make sure that your interpretation will be original enough which 'JOKER' does very well indeed.
'JOKER' is very well directed, there is a clarity of what Todd Phillips is trying to communicate to the audience and he is doing it in a very subtle way.
There is a one scene in 'JOKER' which brilliantly showcases the disconnect of Artur from the normal society when he goes to the comedy club to tries to see what jokes get biggest laughs. However being socially inept the timing when he laughs is totally different than other members of the audience. They laugh on punchlines but he seems to be laughing in random moments, showing clear disconnect from collective subconscious part of the society, making him stand out. Simple choice that communicates to the viewer of the movie so much about the loneliness, separation and longing for human connection which Artur feels.Beautifully lensed by Lawrence Sher with a great slow motion sequences, which gives 'JOKER' grand feature film vibe, but also handheld shots, which with movement of the actor create artistic ballet like sequences when Artur is walking or dancing, putting the audience in a dream like state.However this film would not be what it is without brilliant character study of Joaquin Phoenix!
His performance is definitely up there with Heath Ledger Oscar winning creation of Joker character in Christopher Nolan's 'THE DARK KNIGHT'.
Performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Artur the clown/standup comic who becomes Joker will surely get him nomination for an Oscar.
Phoenix's performance seems to be little bit more subtle and internal. For this role Joaquin lost over 20KG to inhabit the character physically and developed characteristic laugh that comes out of pain in characters emotional core. The interesting part is that after we witness Artur's misfortunes we start to identify with his struggle because we understand that his mental illness comes from disturbing childhood and years of abuse. His ability to twist his thin body in weird positions reminded me Christian Bale performance in 'The Machinist'(2004) another movie about paranoid delusions.
Joaquins performance of Joker reminds us how weirdly talented he is with acting choices that are very original and emotionally engaging.On top of everything Todd Phillips in 'JOKER' seems to showcase clash of two worlds.
The world of super rich and those who are poor, who often deal with mental and emotional problems. Even Gotham City is stylized to look like modern day San Francisco to give that incentive.
This film does not promote violence but in a way justifies it. Artur from a victim becomes a hero to many, because he decides to stand up for himself and use image of the Joker as a catalyst for this change and in that way he becomes symbol of revolutionary change for those who are less privileged.
But most importantly 'JOKER' as a movie is a mental illness study intertwine in social and economical satire that brings questions about the discrepancy between super rich and poor people in American society today.I will most definitely see 'JOKER' again to have further assessment, but after the first viewing I am pretty sure next March we will see some Oscars coming its way.
Highly recommended!

Edge of Tomorrow," There is a lot to like in the 'Edge of Tomorrow' science fiction thriller about the alien invasion with surprising comedic undertone.
","There is a lot to like in the 'Edge of Tomorrow' science fiction thriller about the alien invasion with surprising comedic undertone. Pre-production on'Edge of Tomorrow' started exactly one week after Tom Cruise wrapped up the work on 'Oblivion' another S/F alien invasion movie which as the 'Edge of Tomorrow' is definitely return to the form by Tom Cruise. The easiest way to describe this film is to imagine a cross between the comedy 'Groundhog Day', the robotic body armor of 'Pacific Rim' and moments reminding us of Matrix as this film is based on of manga and novel 'All you need is kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Epic action of Edge of Tomorrow unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tome Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop- forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski. And, as Cage and Rita take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy. Aliens control time therefor they always know about the moves of the human soldiers. A lots of comedy comes from the sense of confusion and repetitiveness of whats happening with Cruise's character. Even though we see one day from perspective of many angles it never gets repetitive due to the like ability of Cruise's performance from totally inexperience coward to seasoned military leader. Emily Blunt deliver equally enjoyable performance even though the romantic chemistry between them is not quite there. Her name would suggest that she has Polish roots with a surname like Vrataski. At some point Bérénice Bejo was considered for the role but I think the choice of Blunt was the right one. She possesses the right amount of feistiness and strength/sensitivity the military leader of the resistance should have. The action partnership between the two is very well developed though. The alien creature design might not have been the best, relaying more on super fast CGI animations of the creature that does not aloud us to see much of them in the beginning which is rather good.The body armor that the soldiers are using as a strength and weapon support is looking very futuristic, but also very cumbersome in the amount of movement the soldier can do, in fact similar type suits are reality now and are developed as TALOS (Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit) in USA. The action scenes are breathtaking, the movie works on all the necessary levels to experience it as a big summer Hollywood blockbuster. I will definitely see it again it was that enjoyable. See it in IMAX 3D if you can. The sound design was brilliant with a lot of reverb used enhancing the overall experience.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",9,4,9,29 May 2014
Whiplash," Ultimate highlight here are the performances of the main actors.
","In our memory we all have a teacher that was truly hard on us. Someone of them we admired and resented at the same time. Sharing my personal story, I use to have been a professional ballet dancer and had teachers who mentally and physically assaulted me and put me through some of the worst experiences of my life. My first female ballet teacher from age 10 till 13 use to, on a daily bases, would break a wooden ruler on my body or if I was lucky on bodies of someone else in the class. From age 13 till 17 we had psychopathic male teacher who apart from constant psychological abuse, would actually be assaulting us physically, which eventually got him suspended from the school many years later when he unleashed his rage on someone from the younger students who eventually got concussions. Now, those memories of my early ballet training with people that should have never been allowed around children created in me sense of willingness to work hard and succeed in this difficult artistic profession. After 12 years of professional career dancing in some of the best companies in the world, I am able now to forgive the horrors of my youth and try to look for positive spin on the training I had with people that in it's core were full of resentment and pain. They simply found position of power in their relationship with pupils and ultimate power corrupts, specially if they themselves did not had fulfilled careers in the first place. Would I have been less successful if I had normal teachers, I don't know. Motivation to prove someone wrong can also be a powerful fuel... 'Whiplash' written and directed by Damien Chazelle won an Audience Award at this years Sundance Film Festival among other awards and is gathered plenty of positive review, like this one on it's way. It seems everyone can identify with this subtly told story of the relationship between student and his mentor that takes dramatic turns as the story progresses.'A promising 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) enrolls at a cutthroat Shaffer Conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.'Young people specially in artistic professions are often very sensitive. They express their pain through artistic expression. Their life might not be the most financially stable and often a good teacher will demand more from the students that have a lot of potential. In 'Whiplash' character played by Miles Teller displays that masochistic dedication to his craft that usually have potential to be turned in to a successful career. This is precisely why he is being pushed by J. K. Simmons character beyond exhaustion and mental breakdown. I am not a huge Jazz fan and yet I was absolutely captivated by the scenes of countless rehearsals and performances which created the state of constant tension and fatigue for the characters. The mixture of sweet, blood and tears is literally on display here. The way those scenes are edited created in the viewer sense of anticipation to look for a breaking point that will end the movie in a valiant outburst of a tragedy from one of the students. To Damien Chazelle credit he keeps the audience not only entertained but also surprised by twists and turns of story that with lesser writer/ director could become very predictable. But the ultimate highlight here are two roles of the main actors. Miles Teller who apparently has been drumming since he was 15 years old, took additional lessons 4 hours a day, 3 days a week to prepare for the movie and let me tell you, he displays masterful control over the instrument. On top of the physical challenge he wonderfully displays the emotions that makes us root for him to succeed. In the past he played mostly in comedies however here he truly showcases his dramatic edge that works as a counter part towards J. K. Simmons character. There has been talk of J. K. Simmons might be getting a Oscar nomination for this role of sadistic, narcissistic teacher and indeed it would be justified one. In 'Whiplash' the amount of venom that comes out of his being is intoxicating for the characters around him, as well as the audience. I am glad that he finely received opportunity to showcase his dramatic edge that might indeed bring him more work of this kind in the future. To be very picky I must say the Academy always likes to reward with nominations characters that display duality and bring aspect of sexuality to their performance which this character had plenty potential for which J. K. Simmons shy away from. That might have been a fault of the director though. Never the less J. K. Simmons delivers arguably his best work in his prominent career. As I mentioned before I am not a huge Jazz fan but I was very entertained by this complex character driven drama that is worth seeing for the performances alone. This film forced me to go back to my childhood and reevaluate my relationship with teachers that scare my inner self and yet in some way made me the person I am today for better or worse. Perhaps as they say what want kill you will only make you stronger...You decide this weekend by watching excellent 'Whiplash'.For more of my reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",8,0,3,12 November 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Arguable the best independent movie of the year!
","There always has been a form of competitiveness between film and theater actors. Theater actors would often say that film actor performance depends on the editing, where in theater you need to be able to maintain the character for the duration of the whole play and maintain it every night for however long the play runs. Also the amount of dialog which needs to be learned by head in theater is mostly larger then in film, where director is trying to show the story and not tell it verbally, so to speak. Often cutting unnecessary lines from the script as much as possible to keep it visual. Theater and film are just two different mediums which need two different techniques of the narrative acting expression. In theater the contact with the live audience can be very rewarding indeed, but often the theater actors have a movie star aspiration and they feel like they would love to be immortalized on the silver screen forever. On the other hand you have movie actors who in the twilight of their careers comeback to the theater to see if they still got it. It is always best when actor does theater and film work respectively, which keeps him artistically balanced. Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' might be right up there with 'Boyhood' as this years best independent movie, which has received numerous Oscar Nomination including Best Film, Actor, and Supporting cast, etc. The last few years Michael Keaton has not been working much, therefor it is such a pleasure to see him taking upon himself such a complex, honest and multilayered performance, as the washed up actor known for a comic book franchise 'Birdman', which obviously is inspired by his performance in the Tim Burton versions of the cape crusader 'Batman'. He is trying to jump start his career by writing, directing and staring in his own play on Broadway. The amount of pressure on his shoulders is unbearable considering that his co-star played brilliantly by Edward Norton tries to sabotage the whole endeavor, as well as Keaton's inability to differentiate between what is real and what is imagined does not make things easier. The whole film is shoot, in what appears to be one continuous shot which in itself is a very hard thing to accomplish. This is not only difficult on the filmmakers, to connect the scenes through invisible wipes (sideways or vertical movement of the camera that blends two scenes together seamlessly), but also puts actors in very hard place, where they often have to deliver up to 15 pages of dialog and hit all the blocking, focus marks, for the scene to work properly. Thrust me, this is very difficult thing to do and only few filmmakers in history where successful in doing so. Alfred Hitchcock with his movie 'Rope' immediately comes to mind as well as more arty and extremely disturbing Caspar Noe's 'Irreversible' which contains uncut continuous anal rape scene, which already passed on to the movie history books, as one of the most rough and realistic rape scenes in cinematic history. Coming back to the 'Birdman', as you watching it, there is a sense that Alejandro González Iñárritu delivered something very special. The reality of the performances creates the feeling like the audience are watching an actual real events unfolding, sometimes interrupted by Michael Keaton's internal and to some extent schizophrenic dialog between him and the character that brought him film related fame the Birdman. I think Michael Keaton delivers, what might be arguably his best performance to date. His willingness to showcase his inner self, to dive in to complex character of an aging star, creates in us feeling of endearment towards him as we all wish him to succeed. He often mumbles and delivers lines in very unorthodox manner which brings back to memory a genius of Marlon Brando at times. He is well supported by Edward Norton who also gets emotionally and physically naked here. The scenes of them together are some of the best in the film. Norton's confession towards Emma Stone's character who is playing Keaton's jaded daughter, about the fact that the only time he does not pretend is on the stage, creates sense of intimacy and honesty which obviously has been noticed this year by Academy which nominated Norton for an Oscar for supporting role. But this film is much more then just two man show. All the supporting cast did really well including Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough. Watching the 'Birdman' I must say the filmmaker inside me was trying to figure out where did boom operator and sound technician placed microphones for clean recording of the sound. This is also one of the categories 'Birdman' was nominated for Sound Editing. For some reason, stylistically, watching it, I was reminded of Charlie Kaufman's type movies like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation'. If you liked the surreal style of above mentioned movies, then I am pretty sure the 'Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' will be also to your liking, arguable the best independent movie of the year.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",10,2,11,15 January 2015
Marriage Story," Adam Driver will get Oscar nomination and perhaps Scarlett might steal one two.
","REVIEW of the 'Marriage Story'
To fully grasp the meaning and the quality of 'Marriage Story' some essential relationship issues need to be explained. Relationship changes over the years. What starts as lustful need to sexually connect with another human being, transforms over the years to more of a partnership relation.
Our relations with our children permit us to exercise the demons of our childhood and being parent, this time in power position, it helps us heal the wounds our parent did to us.
Using Freudian logic and his 'penis envy' theory it points that woman on a subconscious level envy man, because of their strength and resilience associating masculinity with stability and femininity with being weak and unstable. However from another view point, its the feminine sensibility is what brings nourishment and ability to raise a child in environment that is being protective over the offspring. Children come out of female womb therefor on subconscious level are part of mother's body.
Once woman give birth, there is often change in their character. By fulfilling their motherhood duties, as they age woman cut their hair short which gives them more masculine feeling. They might start to resent their male partner for not paying the same amount of attention and start to look for proverbial plan 'B'. Man as they age loose testosterone and eventually want to prove to themselves that they still got it and invest their interest in trivial things like fast cars and even faster younger woman. Both parties start to resent one another for sacrifices they had to make for their families and eventually grow apart searching for that other person that would bring back that feeling of being worshiped once again.
I was unsure If I will like 'Marriage Story'. Over 2 hour long story of an actress and theatre director intertwined in custody battle over their son might not be for everyones linking, specially if any of you went through an actual divorce this film might be little bit too close to home, so to speak.
Also this movie is very dialog heavy and often feels like a theatre play with actors regurgitating long amounts of text, which is used as the main source of exposition. At one point I felt like I am watching Woody Allen movie minus the neuroses and sarcasm. But as you are investing your time in getting to know your protagonists you start to understand them on a deeper level. Its the performances that hold this film together. Both Driver and Johnsson deliver deep heartfelt performances rooted in something real. But even supporting cast works very well as an unusable.In terms of filmmaking this film will not win any major awards. The cinematography is not 'Marriage Story' strongest point, in fact it lacks imagination making it look like a theatre play, but this film shouldn't be seen for an eye candy that isn't, but for acting performances alone.
There is an Oscar buzz around Driver's performance and I was curious if its justified. And indeed it is. There is specially one scene in the apartment where Scarlett comes to try to mediate with Adam to find peaceful solution to their costly divorce, which takes turn in to blaming game of why their life turned out the way it did. They both are mesmerizing here but Driver connects his rage to something real from his personal past which makes audience feel like they are the fly on the wall and are witnessing something very intimate they were not suppose to see. Confrontation between two people who underneath love one another.Scarlett's character wanted to be individual, not part of overbearing somewhat narcissistic personality of her husband. Actors are like children, they want to play, deep down inside looking for an approval from their parent figure - director, who is there to help them conceive their performance.
But in her performance Scarlett resents him for loosing interest in her although as they have opportunities to be with other people they are still connected in sense of belonging to one another.
Bottom line 'Marriage Story' isn't a perfect movie by any means, but thanks to very good cast and smart writing as well as brilliant performances it elevates it beyond my expectation.
And yes Adam Driver will get Oscar nomination and perhaps Scarlett might steal one two.

Lucy," 'LUCY' is more of an intellectual film discussed as an action film
","Back in late 80's and early 90's Luc Besson burst on to the world cinema scene as one of the few directors who were able to combine the depth of typical intellectual french cinema and action sequences in almost poetic way. His early movies 'The Big Blue', 'Nikita' and 'Léon: The Professional' to just a name a few, were great testament to his unique way of story telling as well as directing style. The characters he creates, being also a writer of the scripts for most of his movies are usually loners who care about themselves until something or someone changes their life irreversibly. Smart Hollywood producer once said that directors are like pitchforks for a while they are in tune with what is hip and top quality, but after while they loose their tune and they never come back to the time of an excellence from their youth. Well that is one man's opinion, because everything is cyclical so something that was in fashion many decades ago eventually will comeback in to fashion again. We often use the technology that helps us to achieve the final product that is theoretically improved. In reality we recycle old ideas and it is very hard to not give them our own individual twist. Mostly for directors it is almost impossible to top the success of the movie that brought them fame and recondition. You aways will be judged more harshly now then before, because more is expected of you. But to be a great director you need a life experience and that comes with time. 'LUCY' is one of those movies that you will either like it or hate it depending on if you like Besson's narrative style. 'A woman (titled LUCY played by excellent Scarlett Johansson) is accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic.'In this straight forward premise Besson is hiding deeper meaning to what otherwise would have been predictable and unoriginal story. There is a lot of intellectual information delivered in a coded way by using so called cut aways and fast montage that illustrates the parallel between the story of the main character and the evolution of life on our planet as we know it. This at first might be quite confusing for the viewer but eventually you understand subconsciously what Besson is trying to tell us. By choosing symbolically the name LUCY he points us in the direction of understanding that Scarlett Johansson's character is a first human being to ACCESS 100 % of the brain capability paralleled by a sorry of the first 3.2-million-year-old ape 'Lucy' who was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton discovered by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray on the November 24, 1974 on the coast of South Africa. Those of you who expect an all out action film might leave the cinema disappointed. 'LUCY' is more of an intellectual film discussed as an action film, if that makes sense. Scarlett Johansson is excellent specially in the first act of the film as a 'stupid blond' that gets mixed up with the wrong kind of people that take advantage of her innocence. She is super emotional and as an actor does some great technical work with tears coming of one or the other eye which is not easy. The slow transition from victim to the empowered super human being that eventually can control the reality of time and space is done gradually and is symbolically plastered over the screen with the big number of the percentage of how far of the transition she is in. Morgan Freeman as usual, brought his depth and amazing voice to play Professor Norman that Scarlett Johansson's character comes in contact with. The third act might not be as good as the first two which for a big Hollywood movie might be a bit of a letdown but the intellectual message passed on to us is in itself is full of depth on the intellectual level. I do appreciate what Besson was trying to do here even if he didn't quite succeeded, but at least he chose to challenge himself and us intellectually and I will always like the director who puts first strong intellectual narration over visual content.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",6,1,5,17 August 2014
Godzilla," A combining the scope of the 'World War Z' with correct use of CGI to tell the story of the 'Pacific Rim'.
","Do you like character driven old school giant monster movies? A combining the scope of lets say 'World War Z' with correct use of CGI to tell the story of the 'Pacific Rim'. In many ways this version of 'Godzilla', an old Japanese cult character, story wise is very close to the original Japanese movies from 50's - 70's, Godzilla contra what ever monstrosity writers would come up with. Considering the quality of the movie I was surprised to attend a screening with cinema being half full. Is it because this movie lacks a big name Hollywood star that would be able to hold the pressure of the movie on his popularity. Some might say that Bryan Cranston work is enough, but I beg to differ. Based on the fact that we don't see him enough in the plot, which in itself is the narrative point of the story, the rest of the cast is solid, but without someone truly standing out. Here director Gareth Edwards succeeds in creating a film that even though full of potential references to it's predecessors creates something, maybe less original, but superbly well executed. In moments there are Hitchcock like original story points (without giving to much away, we generally do not expect to get our protagonist killed off in the first act of the movie) at other the main characters and story off the plot seems not well motivated enough to be believable. At first the mission is to send the analog nuclear bomb to destroy the creatures, eventually becoming the danger to the town, so needed to be evacuated on to the sea and detonated there. The good thing about this film is the character driven part of a plot focusing on the characters and their individual stories. The original idea that Godzilla is in fact a 'good' character protecting us from another creatures which due to the radioactivity gained gigantic size called MUTO. Their confrontation in San Francisco is the culmination point of the movie. Of course there are some episodic narrative personal stories that ad to the drama of overall visual extravaganza. 'Godzilla' in fact often leaves a lot to our imagination not showing to much, but when you are able to see something it is truly work of CGI excellence. One of the best use of CGI in combination with great sound design. The music is well contracted specially great musical moment when marines are jumping on to a fog, the composer used the same musical shouts like in Stanley Kubbrick's dark sound for the alien monument on the moon in 2001: A Space Odyssey. For some reason this film style wise and in terms of dramatic choices for gathering tension remind me old movies of Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock and J.J Abrams which is not a bad place for a director Gareth Edwards to be artistically associated with. One of the better movies of it's kind in western tradition of the Monster vs. Monster blockbusters.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",8,2,5,18 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a sort of benchmark of how other action movies will be judged in the future. Excellent!
","There are some movies considering a visual style, the special FX or pure TNT action that set the benchmark of excellence for other movies to follow. These films come very rare, sometime once in a decade. It is even more rare to actually see I remake which is directed by the same director from the original movie and it is total rarity if the new version is better then the original. This is precisely what we get with this years most action charged remake of 'Mad Max: Fury Road', an absolutely marvelous attempt by director George Miller to revitalize this cult 80's classic. The original trilogy set Mel Gibson on to the Hollywood stardom and who knows this film might take Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy to the next level as well. 'Years after the collapse of civilization, the tyrannical Immortan Joe enslaves apocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress the Citadel. When the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) leads the despot's five wives in a daring escape, she forges an alliance with Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), a loner and former captive. Fortified in the massive, armored truck the War Rig, they try to outrun the ruthless warlord's henchmen in a high-speed, deadly chase through the Wasteland.' Essentially the whole movie we might describe as long continues action chase scene. The intensity of pyrotechnics, stunts and greens screen compositions is a unbelievable experience. I had a pleasure to see it twice. Once in IMAX 3D and once in standard 3D. The IMAX version is where the film truly excels, in fact watching it, you as the viewer are actively participating in what is going on on the screen. The combination of great sound design and visuals create hypnotic atmosphere which we are lucky to experience. I must say I don't remember the last time I felt such a rush, it is truly mind-blowing. The way it is shot it looks as if director of photography recorded the action sequences in very slow frame rate and and in the post production editor speeded the action up creating very crisp sharp picture. Normally whenever camera operator moves camera sideways it creates a motion blur. In 'Mad Max: Fury Road' the picture is so crisp that at times is almost looking bit artificial. Apparently 80% of the movie was shot on location using practical stunts and only 20% of sequences where supplemented with CGI. I have to say the first 30 minutes can be put in to a film history books as the most intense and mind-blowing action sequence. This film also uses a different color palate then most post apocalyptic movies of the past which usually focus on washed out desaturated color scheme. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is highly colorful and saturated with red hot explosions and beautiful golden deserts. The final color correction is a real eye candy. The lead performances are very solid. Charlize Theron brings extreme amount of intensity not seen since her magnificent Oscar awarded performance in 'Monster'. You can see that she did her homework. The inner work which she has learned in Ivana Chubbuck studio shines through every inch of her being. There is a strength and vulnerability in her performance which in someway steals the whole movie. Tom Hardy in the last few years became truly well crafted actor. His minimalistic approach to acting brings to mind genius of Marlon Brando. He does't talk much relying on body language and sort of mumbling delivery of lines which creates very believable characterization. The chemistry between him and Theron is very good and we are hoping for them to succeed and fall for each other on the romantic level. It looks like Nicholas Hoult has been casted based of his performance as a lovable zombie in 'Warm Bodies' and to some extent delivers similar type of performance as a War Boy - Nux who is trying to get to mythical Valhalla, place popularized by Vikings as the paradise after death where all the real warriors reside after their heroic death. In terms of the story or rather a plot 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is very straight forward which for some might leave something to be desired. But lets face it this film does what it promises. It offers mind-blowing action unlike any other you have seen in the last few years. In that regard 'Mad Max: Fury Road' sets a new standard for action intensity and it looks like we will see more of sequels considering that Tom Hardy signed a contract to make 3 more movies. If there is one thing to be critical about it, is the fact that plenty of dialog was rerecorded using ADR (automatic dialog replacement) which gives sense of artificiality, because it is very difficult to rerecord dialog and give the same type of performance intensity as in the actual take on location. The reason for it might be above mentioned frame rate racking, which later in post- production is being speed up where lips do not move in sink with the sound of the actors and subsequently need to be looped in ADR session. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a new type of movie of a digital filmmaking age, sort of benchmark of how other action movies will be judged. I loved it and if you like an exhilarating action you won't be disappointed as well. I promise!",10,6,17,23 May 2015
