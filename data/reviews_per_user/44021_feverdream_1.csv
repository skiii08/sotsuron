Requiem for a Dream," like a knife
","being directed by my favorite director, requiem was a delight to behold. at first, i was mesmerized and instantly drawn into the story, characters, and beautiful cinematography. as the movie progressed, i begain to weep, and normaly when i cry while watching a sad film, it is just a few tears, and then im fine. requiem holds on to you, puts a knife to your throat, and teases you with it. i have never been physically tormented by a movie before, but this one made me want to vomit. it was a master work, but one must definatly be brave before watching this.",10,0,0,10 August 2001
