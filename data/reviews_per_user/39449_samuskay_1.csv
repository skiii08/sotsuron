Sucker Punch," i don't understand why people hate this movie so much
","yes i agree this movie isn't perfect but its still pretty enjoyable.when i first put the DVD in and started the movie i didn't really know what to expect. the first 10 minutes were just brilliant and quite well done. now when she gets to the asylum....this is when i got confused, because i didn't get straight away that there were 3 different reality's so i was confused for a couple of minutes. but from here on it was a blast to watch from start to finish. the fight scenes (apart from the one with the Nazis which i didn't enjoy as much) were just epic and really impressive. at the end the person who was performing the lobotomy said 'did you see how she just looked at me' most people won't understand what the meaning of this is. to be able to understand this you will have to watch the extended version (which is arguably the best version) which explains what actually happened. if your watching the unextended version then you will probably be a bit confused at the end. the extended one deserves 9/10 but as I'm giving a score to the one everyone saw in the movies it deserves a 7/10, its not perfect but its a pretty exciting ride",7,4,7,7 February 2012
