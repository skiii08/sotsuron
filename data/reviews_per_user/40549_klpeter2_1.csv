Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips Movie Review
","'I am the Captain now.' A statement continuously reiterated throughout the film, Captain Phillips. Based on the book, A Captains Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea, the film Captain Phillips exemplifies a thrilling, unbelievable, and incredible story about a man and his crews overwhelming journey in the Somali basin. Played by the talented Tom Hanks, Captain Phillips begins with an intimate insight into the daily routine life of Richard Phillips, and it is only there that the film truly begins. After reporting onto the Maersk Alabama, Phillips prepares to deliver 17,000 metric tons of cargo to Mombasa, Kenya, in which he must pass through the pirated waters of the Somali Basin. There is a sensation of alarming calmness in the beginning of the film as Phillips receives emails concerning piracy, considers them, but quickly shoves those concerns to the side, as if these warnings could be an omen to the hijacking of Phillips ship. The events that consequently transpire are overwhelming and will leave you in a trance-like state as you are on the edge of your seat waiting to see who will falter and who will triumph. It is during a routine ship emergency drill, that Phillips sporadically assigns his crew, when he realizes two skiffs with armed men heading towards his ship. The drill then transforms into a reality, in which Phillips and his crew do everything in their power to steer the skiffs away. Being an unarmed ship they unfortunately fail and 4 armed Somalia pirates board the Maersk Alabama. What was once an outing to the movies, transforms into a sheer reality as director Paul Greengrass and cinematagraphor Barry Ackroyd are able to create a feeling of being on the actual ship with Phillips, his crew, and the pirates. Immediately you will be drawn into the film and overcome with imminent fear as exemplified within all characters of the film. Faking the appearance of a 'broken ship' the pirates are overcome with anger when the safe only holds $30,000 and no way of maneuvering the vessel to the Somali shore. Muse, the leader of the pirates demands to see the engine room and after obstacles he and his pirates face, they demand to leave the ship with the life boat, but not without Phillips. It is within this part of the movie you see the heart wrenching sadness and fear exhibited within Phillips as he sits in seat 15 stuck in a tiny vessel in the middle of the sea with four armed pirates heading to Somalia. Fortunately for Phillips the Navy and SEAL TEAM six track the small lifeboat and are able to strike a sort of deal with the pirates. Throughout the film Phillips appears to be calm and composed, consistently offering the pirates advice, food, water, and even medical assistance. He attempts to establish a friendly and working relationship with the pirates in hopes that he will be able to return home to his wife and children. In the event that he cannot, he writes his last words on a crumpled piece of paper, that paper in which never reaches his family. During this final portion of the film, you will be overcome with a sense of hope for Phillips' survival but also a small sense of sadness for Muse's failed negotiation tactics. Captain Phillips is truly 'an edge of your seat' thriller, will leave you with tears at the end, and leave you with a fulfilling understanding of what it truly means to be a captain. If you are looking for a thriller, a film that captures the unique dynamic between the 'good guys' and 'bad guys' then I would strongly suggest going to the movies to see Captain Phillips. Out of five stars, I would most definitely give the film four stars for its talented known and new actors, unique cinematography, and an unbelievable feeling of reality.",8,1,3,19 November 2013
