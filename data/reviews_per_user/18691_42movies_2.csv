Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Go see it. Now. Go. ...I mean it. Go now. Again...
","It WAS fitting of the series. It is meant to be the introduction chapter of the whole series, so of course it had to drag a little for character building's sake. Other than that, I thought it had more than enough action, and Lucas topped himself with the added dimension of the final battle. For example, in RTOJ, there were three battles all going on at once, affecting each other's outcome. There were 4 in this one, and the battle was more creative at each of the sites. This is the first movie I've given since the mid 80's a 10 out of 10 rating.",10,0,0,2 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," An awful amount of fighting over one little Amendment.
","This was one of the better movies of the year, but of course not many people at all are going to enjoy it. -A true shame, this movie is a great weapon against the oppressors of the 1st amendment, which is what makes movies like this few and far between. Mainly though, it was just funnier than anything I've seen since Blazing Saddles. The only bad thing about the entire movie was that some of the less funny songs, meant to be melancholy, went on a bit too long. -But otherwise, it was one hell of a laugh. I also would not let any children under 18 see this film, but for those of us who can, will hurt ourselves laughing. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,2 July 1999
