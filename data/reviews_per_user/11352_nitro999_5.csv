The Lobster," Okay, I failed to get it
","Okay, I'll say it. I agree with the reviewers here who thought this movie was rubbish and I think those who say it was great are in the 'emperor's new clothes' arena (If you fail to 'get it' then you are intellectually inferior). In science fiction you can go anywhere and do anything (that's the beauty of the genre) as long as you stay within the confines of the premise, the 'logic' of the premise driving the story, and the 'rules' set down. This movie stayed in the premise but the audience was never told why the premise existed in the first place, why certain 'rules' were instigated and why most of the things that happened happened. Much of what turned up on the screen seems to have come from the writer's random thoughts with no real chance for the audience to get involved in the story and therefore to feel any empathy for the characters. Makes for very poor story telling. I was bored and disappointed. And I've seen Colin Farrell do much better than this (I hope he takes the weight off – the few extra pounds have made him look very ordinary). 2 out of 10 for me.",2,42,73,7 December 2015
Green Room," A must watch if you have any appreciation of indie efforts
","I watched this movie because I so enjoyed Jeremy Saulnier's 'Blue Ruin' in which I thought all the characters were 'real' people and the action believable. If you want a brief respite from Hollywood's high-dollar, high-tech gloss then you will probably enjoy this depiction of a nitty gritty, down and dirty, all out, no holds barred fight for survival. Set aside a couple of hours and give this movie a watch. The acting was good, particularly from Patrick Stewart whose appearance in this Indie effort lent it some Hollywood 'depth'. The movie would have been just fine without him, but it was good to see him playing a cool part in a low budget show. Okay, there were a couple of 'oh-I-wish-I'd-had-my-eyes-closed-when-that-happened' moments but nothing too far out. As in 'Blue Ruin', all the characters had a 'real people' feel. Highly recommended - by me anyway. On my 0 to 9 scale an 8.",8,7,8,1 December 2018
The Hateful Eight," Come on! Give Quentin a break - well worth a look
","I use IMDb a lot but for someone who sees around 200 movies a year I have written few reviews but when I do I always write the review before I look at what others have written. Then I look before I post. Now, having seen the slather of 'hateful' reviews I feel I must say more before posting. I think if any other director had made this movie the reviews would have been, in general, somewhat different. We should allow Quentin to make a non-Tarantino movie once in a while.This is what I want to say: In this latest offering from Quentin Tarantino I give Quentin 10/10 for story telling. No standard formulas for our Quentin; he unlearned them a long way back. For the movie as a whole I was hanging back from a 10 because a section of exposition in the early going was somewhat drawn out, a little slow, verging on becoming static (here I agree with the 'slow' verdicts). However the overall atmospherics, the dialogue, the directing, the camera work settled into a satisfying pace and I, for one, failed to pick the twists and turns and didn't find myself becoming bored at any point even though most of the movie was set in one room; kind of like a stage play, but that didn't bother me (I had the same sense of being trapped by the storm as the characters did). I do agree it could have been shortened a little. But, overall, I enjoyed the movie and so did my wife. When it was over I figured QT deserved the extra point for doing his civic duty, economy wise, by keeping the fake blood manufacturers in business. I suspect this is one of those movies that gets panned initially but 'matures' with reflection. Probably not quite another 'Django Unchained' - but 10 out of 10 from me.",10,4,13,5 February 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards is something really really different
","Most movies fit into a genre and follow a formula. In my opinion 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' defies classification. If you are hungry for something which is 'from' Hollywood but not 'of' Hollywood, then go see this movie. Okay, there are some plot holes and few times when you might find yourself saying, 'Oh really !!'. But, man of man, this movie is entertaining. The story line is totally unpredictable. I understand Francis McDormand is married to one of the Coen brothers and the flavour of the movie makes me suspect her husband and brother-in-law were sending a few suggestion notes in through the back door.The production standards are good, much of the dialogue is brilliant, and the acting is fabulous (great soundtrack as well). Francis has to be one of Hollywood's top players and Sam Rockwell was simply brilliant. Don't be surprised if he gets nominated for his performance. He has been on my A list since I first noticed him in 'The Green Mile' way back in 1999, and since then, with pieces like 'Matchstick Men' and 'The Way Way Back', he has never disappointed. Woody Harrelson has come a long way since 'Cheers' and has matured into a great character actor.Some contributors here have slammed this movie, and I can see why - it is not without some faults, but 'Three Billboards' really is something different. Do yourself a favour, go see it and make up your own mind. But, if you are going to get bent out of shape by questions of racism and political correctness, like some reviewers, then don't bother.I'm forgiving the plot holes and awarding a 9.",9,2,6,4 January 2018
La La Land," Not even a good musical
","Come on people, step back a bit and get some perspective on this show – put aside the Hollywood hype. The story here – trying to make it big in LA – has been done a million times and this attempt failed to show us anything new. I respect Ryan Gosling as an actor; I think he has great range and has shown this in many vastly differing roles (Drive, The Big Short, Crazy Stupid Love, The Place Beyond the Pines, Gangster Squad, Lars and the Real Girl, Fracture), but he is not a song and dance man. Emma Stone is a competent actor; I've never seen her do anything badly, but nothing that would promote her to my A list, and she should leave song and dance alone as well. Even the fantasy scenes were nothing new or special. I thought the ending was something new and very well done, but that's about it. The story, boring and ordinary, was presented at a snail's pace (I overheard someone near me, in a packed theater by the way, say, 'Oh, come on, get on with it.')If you want to see a real musical, dig through your old DVDs for 'Cabaret' and 'Sweet Charity', both musicals that owe nothing to anything that came before and stand as living tributes to the genius of Bob Fosse.I'm not listening to the Hollywood hype and marking this at a 3 (barely worth watching on DVD).",3,15,26,16 January 2017
