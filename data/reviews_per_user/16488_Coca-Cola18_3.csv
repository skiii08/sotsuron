Raiders of the Lost Ark," Two Words 'Kick Ass'
","This film is two years older than I am, but RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is my childhood, this was the movie that was on every school break, Easter and Christmas along with FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR and dare I say it SHORT CIRCIT AND THE POLICE ACADEMY FLICKS!!! It's just a really excited film, and definately the best of the three. And it's always nice to see the baddies get what they deserve (in this case the Nazi's) Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg really knew what they were doing back then!Harmless pop corn fun! A movie that doesn't want Oscar's but just people to say 'Now that's why I paid my entrance fee'. I would of loved to see Raiders at the cinema!RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK8/10",Null,0,0,21 April 2002
Lost in Translation," Good. Very Good.
",'Lost in Translation is an ideal film for those pseudo-intellectual yuppies who couldn't tell a good film if they were told it was'Can't help but be offended by the comment made on this site by another IMDb member... I couldn't disagree more.I'm not 'psedo-intellectual' infact I wish I was!!! hahahahaYes it's slow but that is so meant to be... I can't imagine L.i.T in a faster pace because that's not what the film is about!Bill Murray is a legend. Don't need to say any more than that.Sofia Coppola will be the first women to win BEST DIRECTOR (one day) and fully deserves her academy award for this brilliant film8/10,10,0,1,9 March 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Please just one favour....
","...Let this film be the last of the Indy series. Please do not get me wrong I love the series well with the possible removeful of The Temple of Doom from that equation! As I write this, rumours are circulating that O.A.P Harrison Ford is to don hat and whip for another movie, DON'T!!! This was a good end to the TRILOGY. The Nazi's are here to locate the world's finest undiscovered archeology the HOLY GRAIL, Not if our Indy can help it! SHOCK HORROR aswell because we have a baddy American helping the dude with the moustache....Adolf find the cup. Connery, Sean Connery is pretty good as Jones Senior as is River Phoenix's brief well I guess who can call it a cameo as Indy in his youth. The Welsh warrior John Rhy-Davies seems to only do films that will live forever INDIANA JONES AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS, I think we can say he'll retire a happy man! Denholm Elliot is suprisingly brilliant being a clumsy idiot!Indiana Jones and the LAST Crusade....7 1/2 out of 10",Null,0,0,21 April 2002
