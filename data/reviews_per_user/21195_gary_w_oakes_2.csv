Moneyball," Terrific movie
","Inspirational, educational and enjoyable movie, the cast is superb, the script tight full of emotion with a sprinkling of comedy. If you know baseball, it's a must watch. If you don't know baseball it's an equally important must watch.Terrific movie.",10,5,6,21 April 2019
Aquaman," Utterly awful, goes from bad to worse
","How on earth is this rated anywhere above 5? It starts off laughably bad, and I mean almost parody bad. So bad I asked my 13 year old comic book movie fan boy son if he'd got ya watching some sort of joke YouTube version, nope this was the real movie.As bad and as laughable the first 20 minutes are soon seem like Shawshank Redemption compared to what follows.Trying to be all the best bits of the Marvel movies such as Ragnorok, Guardians etc, and ending up looking more like Lazytown.Honestly this is utterly dreadful, whatever you don, don't waste any money buying this on VOD or DVD / Blu-ray. Please.",1,4,7,12 April 2019
