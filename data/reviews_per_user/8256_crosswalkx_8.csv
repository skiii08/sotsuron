Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Roger Rabbit was so annoying and I didn't like the PG-13 content
","I have seen this film even as a kid and I could not stand Roger Rabbit, he was so annoying, he ruined the film for me as I cannot not stand annoying cartoons. I didn't like watching the opening cartoon film since Roger Rabbit was irresponsible with being a babysitter. Seriously he's the worst babysitter ever. I also didn't like it that Herman the baby caused kitchenware to spill and the rolling pin tripping Roger and getting him baked in the oven or getting electrocuted or having pots and pans falling on his head and getting hit with a refrigerator.I also didn't like Herman the baby who was a rude baby. I didn't like how extremely annoying Roger was to Eddie and I didn't like the hot sauce scene as it scared me I didn't like Roger vandalizing dishes or being a showoff and later on with the acid gun threating to hit Roger and Jessica.I actually liked Eddie the grumpy detective much better and I've felt sorry for him that his brother was murdered. I liked Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom up until it depicted him as a creepy cartoon after being run over by a steamroller and then burning in acid at the factory. I didn't like the weasel cartoon mafia gang that they would go around hurting people or trying to kill Roger Rabbit.I was shocked at the PG-13 profanity used in Roger Rabbit just like in Back to the Future. I also didn't like the sexy scenes with Jessica Rabbit showing her big breasts or her leg thighs or when Mavin cheated on Roger Rabbits wife and committed adultery which made me very uncomfortable, it was very awkward to for me to watch. I was shocked at the graphic violence with the acid dip eraser killing the cartoon shoe and even killing one of the weasel gang members.The car chase and car crash scene involving hitting police officers on their motorcycles was scary for me to watch. I didn't like it that Judge Doom caused Benny the cab to crash into a light pole. I didn't like that annoying cartoon woman chasing after Eddie.The only parts I liked in the film it that we got to meet Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Dumbo, Fantasia characters, Three Little Pigs, Pinocchio at Toontown. I also liked the Warner Bros characters Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester. Meeting Droopy, Woody Woodpecker, Betty Boop.I think that the live action actors like Bob Hoskin and Christopher Lloyd did a better job in the movie than most of the main cartoon characters.Richard Williams involved with this live action animated film later on tried to finish funding The Thief and the Cobbler before it was wrongfully taken away from him.I'm Surprised the Disney company would be allowed to show this PG-13 rated semi adult animated cartoon this film on Disney Plus which should've been on Hulu. I'm also surprised they would actually have Roger Rabbit at Disneyland since he's from a PG-13 rated film.I would not recommend this PG-13 semi adult animated film to kids and families since this is one of those mature themed cartoons with sexy scenes and graphic violence. I would watch Space Jam or The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle instead since they were more enjoyable to watch, you're also better off watching An American Tail, also I'd rather watch Back to the Future instead of Roger Rabbit since it was more fun to watch.Suggested MPAA rating: Rated PG-13 for partial nudity, suggestive content, graphic cartoon violence, some scary scenes, smoking, alcohol use, crude humor, language.",3,0,3,23 May 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Best Disney cartoon film ever made.
","I was a kid when this Disney movie was released and let me tell you I liked it very much, Belle was smart, kind, caring and stood up for herself, she helped the Beast not act like a monster anymore, I liked the characters including Gaston who looks like King Graham from Kings Quest V and I liked how funny Lefou is in this cartoon. Robby Benson also voiced in King's Quest VI.This cartoon starts off with the young boy prince turning into a Beast by the old beggar woman who's a witch and his castle falling into disrepair, then starts off with Belle going into town, everybody is gossiping about Belle, Gaston is lusting after Belle and harassing her to get married, Gaston, Lefou and the whole town makes fun of Maurice calling him loony old man which always bothered me. Maurice takes off in the woods with an Axe chopping machine, he gets lost in the woods, almost fell off a cliff, got thrown off a horse and chased by wolves, I don't know why the wolves were trying to eat him, I do like wolves. Maurice takes shelter from the storm in the Beasts castle, the Beast is angry with him trespassing in his castle and locks him in the tower dungeon.Meanwhile Gaston tires to force Belle into marrying him at a wedding party, he fails and decides to get revenge on Belle. Belle comes out of the house and sees Maurice's horse returns to the house, Belle heads off right into the castle, wait a minute, how the heck did the horse know where the castle was, maybe it smelled the trail of Maurice. Anyways Belle trespasses in the castle, finds Maurice, the Beast decides to send Maurice home while keeping Belle a prisoner in his castle. Belle is upset, Gaston and Lefou party in the tavern, Maurice barges in the tavern seeking help but they throw him out in the cold.Meanwhile Belle adjusts to life in the Beasts castle, meeting inanimate object friends who were kind and fun to her, Lumière, Cogswork, Mrs, Potts, and Chip helps her out and throw a Be Our Guest Party for Belle, Belle sneaks in the Beasts room, the Beast throws her out and she rides out of the castle into danger with wolves in pursuit, the Beast saves her life and she heals the Beast,Meanwhile at home, Maurice wanders in the woods alone, Gaston and Lefou plot to throw Maurice in the asylum to coax Belle into marrying him. Belle and the Beast finally gets along and they have a hetero love moment and they dance in the grand ballroom. Belle sees Maurice lost in the woods, she leaves the castle, rescues her father and takes him home, after Maurice recovers, Chip was with Belle, then Monsieur D'Arque decides to collect Maurice, I don't know if it was unpaid debt he owed, but then Gaston offers Belle a choice marry him, Belle refuses and reveals the Beast which the mob mistakens the Beast for a monsterGaston takes charge and locks Belle and Maurice up, Chip starts up the axe machine and frees Belle from the cellar door and rides her horse to the castle. Meanwhile Gaston and his men use a battering ram and storms in the castle only to be ambushed by the inanimate objects. They win and Lefou and the villagers run away back to their village, but Gaston snuck off and shot the beast with his bow and arrow, Belle arrives at the castle, the Beast and Gaston face off in mortal combat, Belle helps the Beast up who gets stabbed by Gaston and he falls to his death. Belle loves the Beast who dies, the Beast comes back to life and turns into a young man, the inanimate objects turn back to normal and they throw a ballroom party and they live happily ever after.I liked this movie the characters where fun to watch I liked Belle very much and how smart and fun she was, I liked Lefou, I did like Gaston bragging about his life and strength until he became a town bully and harassed Belle and in the process became a monster in trying to murder the Beast.I liked Lefou, I didn't think he was bad, he was just trying to be Gastons friend and liked the 3 women, he also entertained the guests at the tavern party and cheered Gaston up. I would've liked more screen time on Lefou.I also liked the inanimate objects in the castle, Lumière, Cogswork, Mrs, Potts, Chip, the Wardrobe, Featherduster, they were very funny and they made me laugh, I liked the Be out Guest song, the animation was very amazing, I also liked the Human Again in later versions of the DVD movie, I also liked the Music.Did you Disney fans know Robby Benson and Tony Jay would later voice in Sierra's PC game King's Quest VI Heir Today Gone Tomorrow in 1992? Robby Benson would play as Prince Alexander of Daventry, and there's a Beauty and the Beast subplot in the King's Quest VI game.There were however some missing plots in this cartoon film. My question is was Maurice in debt? Where were the ships that sank in the ocean? Why didn't it show Maurice picking the rose from the garden, that was in the original book? He was working on an invention called an Axe chopping machine for the fair which he never got to go to. Did he ever get to show off his invention? What became of Lefou and his villagers? Was there a funeral service for Gaston who fell to his death? Did Lefou take over Gastons estate? Did Monsieur D'Arque confiscate Maurice's property? We'll never know, but I'll one day make a fan fiction stop motion video that will show Maurice in debt, show Gastons funeral service, Lefou taking over the estate or tavern.This movie has won best animated picture and for good reason, there is a 2017 movie remake which I prefer to forget about since I was bored with the remake.As for the rating of this movie It would be rated PG for some violence, peril, scary scenes, alcohol reference, thematic elements.",10,1,2,24 July 2019
Toy Story 4," This is the worst Toy Story movie that I've seen Woody let me down and Forky is annoying.
","I have seen this movie and I was very disappointed in it. What the heck happened to Woody that we all know from the first 3 Toy Story films? Woody is a weak character, Bo Peep is a selfish jerk who roped Woody away from Bonnie. What happened to Bo Peep, she put Woody down, this is not like her that we know her from Toy Story 1, 2 when she was kind and gentle. I don't like it that they made her into a bossy character and put Woody down.I didn't like the Spork character Forky, he was very annoying, Seriously Woody was weak, yes I know that he had issues with jealously but he changed after that. Also why is Buzz so clueless, he wouldn't hesitate in the first 3 movies. Except when he found out the truth that he's a toy.This movie continues right off when Woody and the Gang are donated to Bonnie, Bonnie goes to kindergarten and is scared, Woody helps her make a craft called Forky who turns out to be very annoying and talkative. Woody and the Gang go on a road trip in a trailer. Woody and Forky jumps out of the window and they wind up in the small town where a carnival is going on. Woody meets a girl doll named Gabby Gabby at the antique shop, they meet the dummy doll guards who kidnaps Forky, Buzz Lightyear now relies on his voice box to tell him what to do.Woody meets with Bo Peep who was donated away and she become sassy and bossy and takes control of the whole thing and they meet new toys including Duke Caboom and Ducky and Bunny. They fail to rescue Forky in their rescue mission. Woody decides to give his voice box to Gabby and the gang stalls the trailer with a flat tire and then having them drive around the carnival. Gabby finds one girl who didn't care about dolls but then finds another girl who's lost and crying and is taken away. Then Woody decides that Bonnie no longer cares for him anymore and decides to be a lost toy and has the kids cheat at the carnival games while the rest of the gang leaves Woody behind, then Forky's girlfriend is made. And this movie ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger.What happened to Pixar and Disney? They made 3 of the best Toy Story movies. What happened to the Woody we knew? I didn't like how he decided to become dishonest and help the kids cheat at the carnival shooting gallery games. I am ashamed of Woody in this film.Also what happened to Bo Peep? She was kind and gentle in the first 2 Toy Story films. Why did become so rude and bossy? I didn't like her very much and how she bullied Woody, put him down and roped him into staying behind. They should've had her still be kind and caring and think about others instead of thinking about herself.Also what happened to Buzz Lightyear, he's now clueless and has his voice box telling him what to do. I'm very disappointed in Buzz, why would he abandon his mission, that's not the Buzz Lightyear I know, Also why didn't they give Jessie and Bullseye enough screen time.I'm very disappointed in this forth movie, they should've just had Jessie the cowgirl be the main star instead. They should've had a different ending with having Woody and Bo Peep coming along for the ride instead of staying behind and helping kids cheat at the game and maybe running into Andy at college.Don't they realize that cheating at the carnival games will cause prices to go up? What message is Pixar and Disney trying to teach us? That it's okay to be dishonest and cheat at Carnival games? I don't like cheating or stealing, toy prizes should be challenging to get not easy to win. This was the most disappointing ending I've seen to Toy Story 4, it should've ended at Toy Story 3, this forth movie ruined it for me.Also why didn't they do a spin off TV series, it would've been better and giving Toys like Hamm, Mr. Potato, Slinky Dog and Jessie their own adventures. I would've enjoyed watching the Toy Story TV series. If they plan on doing Toy Story 5 which I hope not, they better have Woody and Bo Peep reuniting with Andy and maybe Jessie's gang.In conclusion I will forget this forth movie ever existed and watch the first 3. I would've liked to see Andy at College meeting his girlfriend, get married and have kids of their own, that would've been more interesting to watch. In the Meantime I'll watch Toy Story 1, 2, 3 which are far better than this forgettable forth film.",3,7,12,11 October 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," The best Disney video game world with Ralph wrecking other games, funny jokes and my favorite hoverboard scene.
","I have seen this movie and I liked it very much, Ralph is portrayed as a villain is rejected by the Nicelanders, more like Jerklanders. Ralph loses his temper and Felix has to help out Ralph.I liked how Ralph tells everybody he's tired of being the bad guy and everybody reacts in the room, Ralph goes home and goes to a party, the Jerklanders refuses to accept Ralph which causes Ralph to wreck the cake and then he runs away from home to a bar and he steals the armored suit from a Soldier to play in Hero's Duty which he interferes with the game. He then steals the gold medal from the game, the bug attacks him and he goes in the escape pod and rockets to Sugar Rush.Meanwhile the teenage girl customer plays Wreck-it-Ralph but the game's unplayable due to Ralph missing, the teenage girl and the arcade owner think the game is out of order and the Jerklanders panic, Fix-it-Felix gets information from Q-bert and goes to Hero's Duty and meet his girlfriend Calhoun. they head over to Sugar Rush.Ralph meets an annoying little girl Vanellope who is a glitched character has stolen Ralphs gold medal and entered into the race, Ralph attacks the race vouchers and is arrested by the donut police and he is taken to King Candy who's also Turbo the racer. Ralph escapes and helps Vanellope train for the race and mistakenly smashes her race car, he goes home to his arcade game only to find it abandoned, he discovers Vanellope is a real character, he rescues Fix-it-Felix and Vanellope,Then Vanellope races and contends against Turbo, the Cy-bug virus breaks out and interrupts the race. Ralph rides a hoverboard and fights Turbo the mutant bug. Ralph crashes through the mentos volcano and it erupts and all of the cy-bugs gets zapped by the pillar of light including Turbo. Vanellope finishes first and the game gets restored back to normal and she becomes a Princess of her game. Fix-it-Felix and Calhoun gets married, Ralph is welcomed back and the Jerklanders finally becomes real Nicelanders, Ralph is back in his game and the arcade owner is convinced it's working again and people line up to play Wreck-it-Ralph.This was the funniest movie ever, we got to see Sonic the Hedgehog, Street Fighter characters, Bowser, Pac-man and the Ghosts. I liked the video game jokes made in this movie, there was even police officers as donuts and their devil dogs which made me laugh, I liked the laffy taffies singing, I liked the Sugar Rush world. I wish Disney would make an E rated Sugar Rush video game, I also wished they would make a T rated game Hero's Duty, sadly we never get to play those games. I liked how the world of Sugar Rush is basically junk food land, and Hero's Duty is a dark world.I liked the part where the bad guys reacts to Ralph wanting to be a good guy, I liked the security check where Ralph is sneaking a cherry. I also liked it how fix-it-Felix accidentally made the bars bigger. I liked how Ralph panicked in Hero's Duty and interferes with the game. I also liked the build your race car scene. I also liked Calhoun reacting with her sad memory of her wedding being ruined. The best part about this movie is the hoverboard scene where Ralph saves the day.I liked Ralph who's bad tempered, I liked Fix-it-Felix, Calhoun a strict soldier and most of the characters including the Zombie man, Donut Police, the Bartender, the hologram soldiers, the candy creatures.I didn't like Turbo who's King Candy that crashed the racing arcade game, or the Nicelanders who were Jerklanders as they caused Ralph to run away from home and almost got their game terminated.Overall this was the best Disney CGI animated film. There's a sequel to this movie but I strongly suggest you ignore the sequel 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' it's a letdown. This movie has won many best animated awards. Anyway's this will be always be my favorite Disney movie next to Treasure Planet, Meet the Robinsons.",10,1,1,12 July 2019
The Lion King," The Boring King with no emotion, how Disney ruined the greatest cartoon movie.
","I have watched and read reviews online about The Lion King remake, when the Disney company announced a Lion King remake I wasn't as excited. I skipped going to see it in theaters and saw it on DVD.First of all I did actually like the scenery and the realistic looking 3D animated animals, I did like the songs and 'The Circle of Life' opening song, but I was disappointed when the 'Be Prepared' song was altered and didn't feature 'Can you feel the Love Tonight' in the credits, but the music was amazing. With that said I want want to share my rant about this cash grab film which let me down.To the Disney company I remember back in 1994 when I seen this 2D animated movie in theaters and on VHS and DVD, I enjoyed it, I liked the color the visuals the facial expressions and special effects, I liked the cartoon characters, they were fun to watch and made me laugh.Fast forward to 2019 remake and what happened, they made it a cash grab. What happened to the emotions? where's Rafiki's walking stick? Where's the amazing song 'I just can't wait to be King' where the animals stand on each other? Why is 'Be Prepared' with having Scar just talking? What happened to the volcano geysers blowing up? Why isn't the stampede epic like the cartoon? Why aren't Timon and Pumbaa dancing to the beat of 'Hakuna Matata'? Or their dance song Hula song? Why is Can you feel the Love Tonight sung in the daytime? Why isn't the movie colorful? How come Elton John's song, Can you feel the Love Tonight is missing.This movie remake is awful, the colors were dark and depressing, the movie bored me to tears, I was bored the entire time, this reminded me of 'The Last Airbender' movie. I didn't like how the lions showed no emotion at all especially Scar. The movie was too slow at times and didn't spend enough time on Simba.I'm very disappointed in the Disney animators, you have all of this amazing CGI technology and amazing looking birds, rodents, lions, other African animals and yet they show no emotion, just voice actors reading their scripts. This is very disappointing, they should've shown emotion like a CGI cartoon, take a look at the 2000 Disney movie 'Dinosaur', you can still tell what they're feeling by looking at their faces. But in 'The Lion King' 2019 you don't know what they're feeling. I can't believe people would go flock to the theaters to pay for this letdown CGI movie remake. This is soulless, dark and depressing along with the remakes of 'Beauty and the Beast' 2017 (at least they had some emotion and a spectacular song 'Be our Guest'), and 'Dumbo' 2019 (Although the ringleader was the only character I liked). Disney should've made it more fun like 'Cinderella' 2015 or 'Aladdin' 2019, those movie remakes were the ones I actually enjoyed watching.In the meantime I'm going back to watch the original 1994 2D cartoon which was memorable in every way. I will skip this boring remake and forget it ever existed and just get the soundtrack which is the only thing I liked about this film. Also I would rather watch a real nature documentary show about lions which is more interesting to watch than this boring movie. I would also watch 'Kimba the White Lion' which is very funny to watch.",1,4,6,27 October 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Bored with the Beast remake and the awful Lefou rainbow hype.
","I have seen this remake in theaters and I was extremely bored throughout this Disney remake, I never want to see it again. I did like the costumes and the Gaston dance numbers, the Beast was good but Belle was awful in this movie.It starts off with the spoiled Prince who gets turned into a Beast and his guest into inanimate objects, then Belle goes into town singing like Hannah Montana which was painful for me to listen to, Belle gets harassed by Gaston who's desperately wanting to marry Belle, Belles father Maurice makes music boxes instead of inventing an axe chopping machine like in the original cartoon. Maurice gets lost in the woods he picks the rose like in the original story and the Beast threatens to kill him but spares his life and has Belle take his place. Belle meets Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Chip and has to learn to get along with the beast.Belle gets to visit her old home which was plagued and her mother died. Belle and the Beast dance in a hetero love moment. Meanwhile Maurice goes to town for help but Gaston leaves him to die in the forest but is saved by Belle. But the town mob locks Belle and Maurice up. They storm the castle and flee in defeat but Gaston uses his shotgun to shoot the beast before falling to his death, Belle loves the Beast and the spell is broken and everybody is back to normal.First of all I hated Belle's character, what the heck were Disney thinking? Where's her dramatic anger and sadness or her being happy or the fun or joking like the 2D cartoon? Why doesn't Belle show real emotion, it's like she read from a movie script in monotones, In the plays I was in, our drama teacher always pushed us to show real emotion, but they obviously didn't have Emma Watson do that, what about singing the real way and not this awful Hannah Montana auto tuning, I'm very disappointed in Belles character she was just another Mary Sue woman for the womens rights movement agenda.I liked the Beast, at least he showed love and compassion even when Belle didn't at all.I didn't really care for Gaston in this version very much, he wasn't as fun as the cartoon Gaston in the original cartoon, he was just a total jerk and darn boring.I would've liked Lefou, he was funny and caring about other people, danced with people, had they not made him a rainbow coming out the closet, I'm very annoyed about the rainbow hype they turned him into just for the political rainbow flag agenda which I'm sick and tired of.The household objects were very boring to watch, I was very underwhelmed with the Be Our Guest Song and Something There song, come on Disney you have these amazing CGI animations and special effects, where's the fun and emotion for Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Chip? They didn't feel like fun characters, they felt like robot characters with no emotion. The 2D cartoons were way more fun and entertaining to watch than this boring 3D lifeless emotion characters.I did like the costumes and the music and CGI animation in the film it was really amazing, but the acting is just not as good as the Broadway play.Anyways this remake movie is a total letdown, I'm very disappointed in this Disney remake, If you want a better Beauty and the Beast movie, I suggest you watch the 1946 Black and White movie, or watch the 1987 live action MGM musical, or watch the 1991 Disney cartoon which is the greatest Disney cartoon classic, or the live action French version in 2014 by Christophe Gans starring Vincent Cassel and Léa Seydoux which is by the way the greatest live action version I've ever seen and my favorite film of all time. Or go watch the Broadway Beauty and the Beast play, also much better than this boring live action remake which I'll never rewatch again.Overall I would rate this Disney movie PG-13 for mild language, some violence, abuse, scary scenes, peril, mild sexual reference.",3,1,2,24 July 2019
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The best movie with Snow White running away from her stepmother queen being a serial killer
","I have seen this movie and I liked how well it was made being the first Disney cartoon movie at the time.Snow White is a teenage girl who lives with her abusive Stepmother the queen who's obsessed with killing Snow White just so she can have the rotten mask in the mirror tell her she's more beautiful than Snow White.First of all I liked Snow White, she's kind to animals and people and 7 funny dwarves. She helped clean up the mess the dwarves made in their cottage house. She did become a homeless woman after the huntsman sent her running away from home.I liked the 7 dwarves Doc, Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy. But I liked Dopey the funny man and I liked Grumpy as I relate to him. The 7 dwarves were nice enough to provide Snow White shelter since she became homeless. I also liked the dance party and they fought the Evil Queen and won.I did like the Huntsman as he stood up to the queen and spared Snow Whites life and tricked the Queen.The Prince Charming character I didn't know much about as the Disney animators didn't give him enough screen time, I would've like to know more about his life. But thankfully he saved Snow White's life with a kiss and they both got hitched and possibly married in the castle.I didn't like the Stepmother Queen at all as she was a serial killer and a murderer in her heart. She ended up growing old like a creepy old beggar woman and tried to kill her stepdaughter with a poisoned apple. Thankfully she came to her untimely death falling off a cliff.I also didn't like the Magic Mirror masked man who deceived the queen and told her lies about her and Snow White her stepdaughter. I wish her stepmother would've broke the mirror and change her evil murderous ways.Overall this is a fairy tale movie but there's some PG-13 content stuff involved in this movie. But it's a very good movie to watch and I highly recommend watching this movie, it is a slow movie but still worth watching.For the rating of this movie I would rate it PG-13 for scary scenes, peril, brief violence.",9,0,0,6 July 2019
Cinderella," Best Disney Princess movie made with the cute cartoon half dressed mice.
","As you know I'm a big fan of Princess cartoon movies and I have seen this movie 'Cinderella' 1950 and I liked it very much. Jaq and Gus definitely stole the show for the most part.Cinderella's mother dies, her father remarries Lady Tremaine but her father becomes ill and dies. Lady Tremaine then becomes abusive to Cinderella while choosing favorites to Anastasia and Drizella who both becomes spoiled brats.Cinderella wakes up singing to her cute mice and bird friends, she gets dressed, finds a naked fat mouse Gus in his cage, Gus becomes fast friends with Jaq and the mice. Cinderella feeds the chickens takes the breakfast trays to Anastasia, Drizella and Tremaine. Luficer the cat almost kills Gus the mouse but Cinderella saves him. Tremaine punishes Cinderella with more household chores.Meanwhile the king loses his temper vandalizes the window with his crown, and yells at the Grand Duke. They organize the grand ball for every teenage or young woman to attend for the prince to choose a woman to marry.The telegraph from the royal palace arrives and Tremaine promises Cinderella she can go if she finishes her chores and finds a dress to wear, but Tremaine allows her daughters to abuse and verbally abuse Cinderella and rips her dress apart. Cinderella runs out crying in the garden. The Godmother arrives and gives her a new dress to wear, creates a coach out of pumpkins, turns her dog and horse friend into humans, turns 4 mice into horses, the godmother warns her about midnight, she takes off for the grand ball.Meanwhile at the ball the prince is bored with the women at the ball, his father is frustrated, the grand duke tells him to calm down. Finally Cinderella arrives and the Prince shows interest and quickly falls in love and dances with her. Then it's midnight and Cinderella runs off and drops her glass slipper.The Grand Duke informs the king about the unknown woman and the King loses his temper and jumps on his bed. The King sends his Grand Duke to travel around to find the right woman to fit the slipper.Cinderella and her 2 stepsisters and stepmother gets ready. But Tremaine locks Cinderella in her room. The Grand Duke arrives tired and worn out. Jaq and Gus steals the room key from Tremaine. The 2 stepsisters tries out the glass slipper and fails to fit in it.Meanwhile Jaq and Gus, their mice friends, bird friends and Bruno the dog fights the cat Lucifer and the cat jumps out the window. Cinderella gets free and tells the Grand Duke to try on the glass slipper, her stepmother tries to interfere but fails as Cinderella has a spare slipper. It fitted her perfectly and she immediately gets married to the Prince who she doesn't know as well and lives happily ever after and the movie ends.First of all I really liked The mice Jaq and Gus who were half dressed wearing a shirt and shoes but no pants and the rodent friends. I rooted for Jaq and Gus defeating Lucifer the cat, unlike the Tom and Jerry cartoons where I hated Jerry but liked Tom more. I did like the cat Lucifer even though he tried to eat the mice, but that's what cats do, they're predators. I liked that the Mice made Cinderella a dress and helped Cinderella escape from her room. I felt sorry for Gus when the tea spilled on his bottom. They even get to be mouse guards. Jaq and Gus are the real heroes in this cartoon film.I felt sorry for Cinderella who was abused as a child by her mean stepmother and 2 stepsisters, because she could only dream but didn't know how to take action and needed a lot of help from her friends. I wished that she could've been a stronger woman character and stand up for herself against her stepmother. I did root for Cinderella because she was kind to her animal friends and even forgave Lucifer the cat, her stepmother and 2 stepsisters.I also felt sorry for the 2 Stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella who were spoiled by their mean mother. Interesting fact, the Stepsister Anastasia and Drizella were modeled after the faces of Judge Whitaker and Scott Whitaker who would later move to Provo Utah to found the LDS Motion Picture Studio.I also like the fairy godmother who helped Cinderella get a new dress and get her to the grand ball, she's also the real heroine.I also felt sorry for Bruno the dog getting tormented by the cat but became a hero in the end. And I also felt sorry for the Grand Duke who almost got killed by the bad tempered king.I didn't like the king sometimes as he was bossy, demanding, short tempered, rude to his Grand Duke and almost killed his Grand Duke, but at the same time I liked him when he was happy and calmed down.I also didn't like Lady Tremaine and for good reason, she's a vain villain, she thinks about herself, she's abusive to Cinderella, makes her do household chores like a maid or a slave. She spoils her 2 daughters which made them bullies toward Cinderella she almost made Cinderella miss the Grand Duke visiting her. She's the only character I don't like at all and was glad Cinderella moved out and got married to a kind unknown prince.I wish the Disney storyboard people would've spent more time on the Prince character because I hardly got to know him. He sounded like a nice man but I would've like to get to know him better.Overall this is definitely a Disney classic and I highly recommend this Disney cartoon to watch. Yes it can be considered dated as there isn't as much woman empowerment as the movie 'Tangled' 2010. but watch it anyways it's the best Disney cartoon movie ever.",10,0,0,21 June 2019
