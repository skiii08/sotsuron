Minority Report," DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
","Now needless to say that I've come to expect less from Stephen Spielberg over the years, and we can see what happens when he just does things for the money *cough Temple of Doom cough cough*.  What could have been another memorable performance from Tom Cruise like in Rainman, A Few Good Men, and Magnolia, was turned in hackney and predictable acting.  Speilberg is only getting crazier, (he and Lucas as the 'love interest' in Clones obvioulsy shows).  Minority-Report was violent, non-plausible, and just plain bad, do not, I repeat do not this is crime against cinema.",1,5,9,8 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Request to the People of the World
","Hello everyone,Well ROTK was astounding (of course).  However I am amazed at the number of comments, reviews, and statements about the film from people who have not read the books before hand.  Listen up people, You cannot fully appreciate this film if you have not read the books! Its impossible!So please, don't go stand here and go on about how long it was, and how it made to many strong statements about christanity, and other plot complexities that you cannot possibly understand.  If you are planning on seeing these movies, I emplore you to read the books before hand.  It gives you an appreaction for the art that Peter Jackson has created, and an understanding of the motavation of the characters.  Honestly, if everyone who has given this movie a poor review had read the books, they'd be on the ground praising Jackson as the cinematic visionary that he is.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
