Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Who is he really making fun of?
","Yes, funniest-movie-ever. But something else I'd like to point out, as many people seem concerned about the political correctness of the movie. He's neither making fun of Jews nor of Khazaki/Eastern European/Central Asian people. The first one, because he portrays anti-semitism in its stupidity, not Jews in their stupidity. And the second one because obviously he takes some stereotypes that people (i.e. Americans) have about other countries and makes a satire out of them. Its obvious they're not serious and real. Americans' reactions in the movie on the other hand, are very REAL and SERIOUS. HE'S ACTUALLY MAKING FUN OF Americans. It's disappointing how people cant see that and *spoiler* laugh the most at the scene where two naked men chase each other in a hotel, when there are so many more intelligent and subtle references in the movie. *spoilers* Not funny (poor taste) scenes include IMHO only the one where he enters into an antique shop and starts breaking things as by accident while the poor seller attempts to help him get back on his feet, and the pointless charade 'Running of the Jew', where grotesque monster-looking Jew-puppets chase people on the streets. But all in all, genial portrayal of the fall-backs of American society.",10,5,15,4 November 2006
