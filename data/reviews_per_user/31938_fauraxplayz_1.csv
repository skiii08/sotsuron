It," Great adaption
","Pennywise has never been this grotesque and terrifying, which definitely helps make this a really effective adaptation that has a lot of great scares, focusing exclusively on the teenage versions of its characters as they fight an entity that embodies their innermost fears. Even stephen king likes it!",10,1,2,20 October 2017
