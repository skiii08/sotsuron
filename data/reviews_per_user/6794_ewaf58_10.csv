Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Very good
",Just watched on blu-ray DVD and was very impressed (I didn't see it at the cinema). I liked the disparate group of characters so much that I almost felt as though I didn't need any glimpses of the original cast (CGI versions and robots).Some of the 70's design sat a little uneasily in this 21st century effort - the plastic cubes representing rank for example and of course the computer graphics - although necessary -looked very old school - but were charming all the same.The battle scenes were very well played out - and extremely violent - so this was not a kids film like the 1977 classic. If I have a small criticism of the war scenes I thought the editing was a bit perfunctory in some sections - it could have been more inventive along with the score. It was as though - this is what a Star wars battle should look like - so we'll edit it this way.Overall though a very enjoyable - and dark - film. I would have liked to have seen more of this group in another adventure - but alas it cannot be.,8,3,7,10 April 2017
Passengers," Really enjoyable - but careful what you tell the bartender
",Well what do 'professional' critics know? It's up to you the individual to decide unless of course it's a genuine stinker - which you'd soon learn about. In my mind the film had charm - great effects - and a lot of feeling.I suppose one of the morals could be - don't tell your android bartender everything as it clearly didn't understand the instruction not to tell about the awakening. I guess its neural net hadn't learn't enough to really understand the full meaning and implications of what it heard and said.I didn't go and see it at the cinema - but bought the Blu-ray instead having read positive reviews from those who clearly enjoyed it.If you haven't seen it - at least rent it - there's no space battles with aliens but it's all the better for it.,8,1,1,10 May 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Enjoyable film
",Just back form the 3D presentation and I did really enjoy the film.The effects were great and the acting very good although I wish some of the 'original' crew had been given more screen time. I have read some of the Luke warm reviews and they do make some good points.My own feelings are that they should take more risks with the next film and explore the real unknown.Think Corbomite Manaeuver and The Devil in the Dark.Perhaps also the sound track could be a little quieter so we can hear what our favourite characters are saying.Do go see and enjoy.,8,6,17,9 May 2013
Justice League," A Hollywood by the numbers film
",Wooden acting - Check. Breathtakingly bad CGI - check - Poor lifeless script - Check - Scrappy editing - check.I can see some fans like this film but they need to understand that they would have come out with an even bigger smiles on their faces if this film had been made properly. By the number quips punctuating the appallingly rendered CGI action sequences and shallow characterisations (sorry Aquaman) end up making this film drab. I had no empathy for any of the characters.If we look back to the Superman film of 1978 - it was full of colour - entertaining characters who we cared for and had a sharp witty script.But these modern day Hollywood moguls have let one side of the superhero badly down. The Marvel side has fared pretty well but something seems to have gone wrong with DC (except Wonder woman)If there is a next film the producers need to invest in a clever intelligent script and throw out any demands for one written for kiddie audiences.The director should insist that real locations are used (where possible) - so the actors don't get bored having to pretend they're somewhere other than in front of a green screen. But above all invest emotion into the film.DC fans deserved better than this - Snyder -Terrio - Whedon - hang your heads in shame.,3,17,34,18 November 2017
Man of Steel," Mature emotional acting mixed with a silly CGI finale
",I really liked this film until the final 40 minutes or so. The flashbacks of Kent growing up and the mystery of who he was - was well done. I particularly liked the scene in the diner which reminded me of Shane.So we had emotion and good acting - so yes this is a Superman film that could bear comparison with the great 1978 offering. Then the writers (including Christopher Nolan) and director bottle it.We just end up with 40 minutes of relentless mind numbingly boring CGI. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters as they bravely battled it out within the artificial World of a computer.I know modern audiences do like huge finales with action but this was like an old vinyl record that had got got stuck and keeps playing the same section over and over again. The 1978 version indeed had an action packed finale - but it involved you so that you felt for the characters.Someone needed to work out an ending that didn't involve tedious minute after minute of wanton destruction but instead made you feel fearful for the fate of those caught up in it.Basically if you've seen one CGI building destroyed - you've seen them all. This is Dumb Hollywood in action as the next film in the franchise was even worse with reference to CGI.,7,0,2,24 September 2017
Aliens," How to make a great film with little money
",Well this great film was made for an inflation adjusted $40m. Now compare that against the $300m spent on Justice league. Of course some DC fans may claim the Justice League is the better film and worth every penny but I'm sure there would be millions of Aliens fans who would disagree.Cameroon here demonstrates how to make a tiny budget go a long way - and even in 2017 most of the effects still stand up - and in my opinion many are far more impressive than modern day expensive CGI could produce.It is impressively directed - acted and scripted - with not an ounce of flab on it. Now compare it to Justice League which is a poorly edited - erratically directed and acted mess.It makes you wonder where all the money goes on these modern day Hollywood flab-busters.So if you want to enjoy a great example of professional film making that will excite you - look no further.,10,1,5,19 November 2017
A Quiet Place," Interest thriller
",I'm sure all members of a family have wished for peace and quiet at some stage but here we have a group who can only communicate by sign language.Some monsters from somewhere that can't see have invaded our Earth and killed most living things. I'm not sure how they would have been able to have built a civilisation advanced enough to manager interstellar distances if they couldn't see but never mind. Even if they came from within our solar system it would be quite some achievement.So exciting in parts and well acted but these monsters - or indestructible Angels of death according to one newspaper clipping - had a fatal weakness - high frequency sound.Why this wasn't picked up by World scientists is unknown - also one of them was despatched with a simple shot gun yet they'd somehow managed to survive much more powerful weapons when the World armies must have fought them.Still it was enjoyable but deeper thought was needed to make it more plausible.,7,0,1,13 August 2018
The Big Short," Boom!
",A truly great film about the corruption in the financial sector. I enjoyed every minute of it and also it was very close to home. I used to set these things up on back office trading systems after they were dealt.I began to notice that we were moving away from ordinary bonds to MBA's - (Mortgage Back Assets) and after a while we moved onto CDO's (Collateral Debt Obligations).What I could never understand - but personally found reassuring - was why the always had such high ratings. I didn't want my bank to take any undue risks and go bust because my job depended on it.In around 2006 I read the 'Economist' and there was a mention about these subprime mortgages. I felt uneasy so I sent them a mail asking why mortgage backed bonds in general had such good ratings... No reply.Anyway I lost my job with them around July 2006 when my job went out to India as I was told they needed to cut costs (It later transpired that the cost of providing two direct connections between the trading floor and the Indian back office cost more than keeping the team in London). However I was treated fairly and got a decent redundancy package and soon found a new job.2008 - kerpow! my ex employer took a huge hit and a year later had to transfer Euro 85bn of problem assets off its balance sheet. It now no longer exists - a once proud bank. Total losses (so far) which had to be covered 23 billion dollars. Numerous trading scandals were unearthed and a new scandal is just being investigated. With hindsight I'm glad I lost my job to get out of the mayhem - but 1000's of jobs were lost in London and Germany due to high level incompetence.There's another crash on the way as Donald is just stirring things up nicely.,10,1,2,8 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Love and hate
",I don't think I've ever read such a selection of diverse reviews before. There is plenty of love - but also plenty of hate for the film.I guess when you go to an Alien film you're hoping it will deliver the thrills and spills of the first two. These were finely crafted films that drew mainly positive reviews - but you can't go on repeating them forever.You could have another mining ship where the crew awake - or another set of colonists wiped out except for a few survivors that are rescued by marines - but you can't - so at least Scott and his team have attempted something different for the last two films.I enjoyed the film and found it interesting with decent amounts of tension. On a personal basis I would have preferred more character development - and at times the crew seemed to have a collective IQ of about 20.In Aliens the main characters were all sharply defined so we could relate to them - but in Covenant we knew very little about them.A few more scenes of them interacting as a group - with their foibles coming out - would have made them more interesting and made us care more when they met their end.However the inadequate makeshift captain was interesting and I would like to have seen more of him (no not his inners). Of course he shouldn't have opened his Easter egg - but who isn't interested in finding out what goodies lay inside - have you never looked into one?I would also have liked a little more credibility in terms of the planet and quarantine procedures. In the original the high IQ Ripley showed a lot of common sense but this crew wouldn't have thought twice about walking naked through a lab containing Anthrax spores and the Ebola virus.I hope Scott is allowed to make the next instalment and perhaps he'll tie all the lose ends up so we end up at the start of Alien.Just think not only will the fans of this film have something to look forward to - so will all the sleeping colonists.,7,1,2,7 September 2017
