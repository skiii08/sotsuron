First Man," Excellent Biopic of the Human Face of Neil Armstrong
","If you want a gut wrenching all action film, move along. This film is a honest and sobering look at the man who was first to step on another world. It shows how the untimely death of his daughter clearly had a massive impact on the man, just as the death of others in the program did, Yes there is the view that blowing the hell out of everything would make it 'better' somehow, but life is more mundane than that. Whilst these where all household names, they were also men, fathers, husbands, friends and they had normalish lives away from being blasted into space - people should remember that most of what they did could be deemed as 'boring' compared to a rocket launch. This is an excellent film and a pleasant change from the usual tripe Hollywood trots out these days.",9,0,1,20 October 2018
