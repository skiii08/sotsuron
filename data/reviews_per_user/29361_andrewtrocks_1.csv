National Treasure: Book of Secrets," feels like you are watching the first national treasure movie
","This movie is action-packed with full entertainment, but it doesn't have anything new to offer. Halfway through the movie i thought i was watching the first movie national treasure movie.The movie follows pretty much the same sequel. They could have added something to spice it up a bit. Other than that the movie was pretty good. All the actors did a pretty good job.I don't suggest you buy it but rent it. This is a movie which you can only enjoy by seeing it one time. You will be bored when you see it the second time.SAve your money don't buy it, but rent it.",7,0,0,29 October 2008
