The Blair Witch Project," Imagination is what drives this movie
","Blair Witch is a movie that uses your imagination as a tool in creating its effectiveness.  If you don't have an imagination, you probably won't like this movie.  Personally, I was caught in the middle between love and hate. On one hand, I absolutely detested the girl that did all of the screaming. I wish the Blair Witch got her first instead of the other guy.  However, it was pretty damn funny watching the three of em' freak out!  The end, though, was what really captivated me.  Just the image of that guy standing in the corner -- showing no resistance and totally submissive to the evil that lurks behind him -- was what hit the homerun for me.  I think the producers did an excellent job with that scene in that they didn't reveal the Blair Witch.  If you saw what she looked like, the whole movie would have been shot.  The images our minds conjure up is what really makes this movie scary.",Null,0,1,23 September 1999
Unbreakable," A very good movie, but maybe not for everyone.
","I can't get over how other people keep comparing this movie with The Sixth Sense.  I thought The Sixth Sense was excellent.  But, despite the fact that the two movies were fairly similar, they still can't be compared.  And in my opinion, they shouldn't be compared.  This movie was fascinating to me in the way the main character (David Dunn) comes to realize that he is capable of incredible potential.  He goes through a sort of 'midlife crisis' -- a self-realization.  Also, the story and plot isn't dumbed down like in most comic book movies, which is a huge relief.  And the fact that the movie takes place in the REAL WORLD enhances the overall effect.  Our hero isn't placed in a 'Gotham City' or some other alternate universe, but instead is thrown into the mix with our everyday society -- in real situations.Even though I loved this movie, I still would be cautious in recommending it to others.  It isn't a movie for everyone.  Some will be disappointed, no doubt.  While I thought the character development was paced just about right, some will think it really drags out.  But for all you comic book freaks out there, and those of you who still hold onto the childhood fantasy of a world with super-heros and super-villains, you could be in for a surprise.",9,1,1,5 December 2000
