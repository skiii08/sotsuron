Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ok whats next...
","Ok, i was very disappointed by this overblown, cartoon based, stupid movie. I would like to ask Lucas where the script went to and the plot.  The acting was laughable, but I give it kudos for special effects, that's all I will give it.",1,2,4,21 May 1999
