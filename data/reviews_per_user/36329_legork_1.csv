The Lobster," Identical mates
","This movie shows, in very grotesque and shocking images that humans are determined to be identical in every way possible to a member of the opposite sex, so that they can realize the urge to mate and procreate the species. Re-education is necessary for people who don't understand the importance of mating with someone who is identical to us and for people who think that one can masturbate instead of mating. Re-education takes place in an institution like a holiday resort conducted under strictly controlled conditions. One of the many requirements, on entering the institution is choosing an animal that one wants to be changed into if all else fails. The movie drives this point home by presenting the hero arriving at the institution with a dog, a cocker spaniel, which is actually his brother who was changed into a dog because he apparently failed to find a matching mate. The woman shooting the cow at the beginning of the movie is obviously demonstrating the characteristic of being a heartless person, because the mate she desires is heartless. Heartlessness is the characteristic she sets for herself and the man who wants to mate with her tries to demonstrate heartlessness also but fails when she shoots his brother, the cocker spaniel. Eventually our hero adapts to a woman in very shocking act. One could also say that this movie points a finger of criticism at the romantic idea of chivalry, such as a man showing his love for a woman by laying down his life for her.",9,0,5,14 January 2016
