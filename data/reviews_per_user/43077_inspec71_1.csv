United 93," A million times better than expected
","Like most people, when I first saw the trailer my heart sank as I thought that finally, the 9/11 films start to roll out.Having seen the film, I am now confident that anyone else considering making a 9/11 movie will think very hard before they go about it. United 93 has set an incredibly high standard. It has resisted the temptation to please the general populace with a flag waving, 'God Bless America' action thriller. To have done this would have been too obvious and really rather vulgar.I don't need to recount the story, for obvious reasons. This is a real time account of two crazy hours, which for most people will bring back some vivid memories. Not a second is wasted, the inherent tension of the situation is brought across in a pure fashion and the acting is superb.I can't see how this film could have been improved.",10,0,2,15 June 2006
