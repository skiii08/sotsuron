Casablanca," a classic
","`Casa Blanca,' is a film directed by Michael Curtiz and released in 1942, which stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Laszlo, Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. `Casa Blanca' is a classic love story, set during WWII, which stars Rick as the main character. Rick owns a club in Casablanca, which is a popular spot to come for all people wanting to escape to America for a better life. It just so happens Rick's former love interest shows up with her husband who is a very important man as far as the war goes, which interests certain people in very high places. Rick is a very emotionally detached, `tell it how it is,' honest kind of guy, with a mysterious carisma. Some would say what a REAL man is. Rick seems to hide a lot about himself, which draws in viewers in on how Rick will react to situations. Which in itself foreshadows Rick ultimate choice, the right thing to do, or what he feels is right to do. Viewing this film in black and white really brings out the feeling of when this movie was set. Overall, I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10 because it's a classic, and will bring a tear to anyone's eye. This film brings the viewer closer to characters, because the director, as well as the actors, bring their characters to life, making it seem as if this story could have been true.",Null,0,1,22 May 2004
Citizen Kane," 7.5 out of 10
","Citizen Kane was way beyond its time. Watching it you get the sense that you are really viewing a film made in today's time but in black and white. In it's time, it was viewed as an outrageous film and even ignored by critics. Orsin Welles himself probably never imagined the film would become such a huge influence on today's cinematography.the way movies are made period. Even in the process of making it, he didn't think it would succeed at all.The stars out with a sign reading, `no trespassing' on a large iron gate outside of a castle looking estate, as the camera draws closer and closer to the castle a light is seen in a window. It burns out and a hand seen dropping a snow globe while a man utters `rosebud.' It turns out the gloomy scene was set inside the snow globe. Charles Foster Kane's who is played by Orsin Welles is narrated in a short film made by a couple of newspaper reporters. As funny as it seems, the movie starts out at the end and goes back in time, breaking out of the traditional film storyline. The newspaper reporters set out on a mission to out the hidden meaning of Rosebud, and in the process of researching this by interviewing key people in Kane's life. The story is told in many different perspectives of his life giving the viewer's brain a little work in the process. The film follows Kane's life from his start at the New York Inquirer to Kane running for governor to the building of Xanadu, which eventually leads to his own demise brought upon himself.Overall the film was absolutely amazing for its time. The excellent camera angles, lighting and special effects were way beyond its time. Citizen Kane is regarded as one of the most important movies in U.S history, basically setting the stage for Hollywood, as we know it today.Orsin Welles (Charles Foster Kane) gives a wonderful performance accompanied by Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton Kane, George Coulouris as Walter Thatcher, and Everett Sloane as Mr. Berstein. The acting was fantastic; the chemistry was good and their performances all complimented each other. I give the movie 7.5 stars out of 10 because it is not the best movie I have ever seen but it impressed me. It blew me away at the time and work and overall creativity put into this movie. Orsin Welles is a genius in my eyes for making this movie. He had no major influences, nothing to look off of or copy to make the movie the way he did. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who truly enjoys and appreciates great cinematography, directing, and just a good film.",7,1,6,17 November 2003
Some Like It Hot," Who play Ukulele in a Jazz Band!!!!
","Some Like it Hot is a film in which stars Tony Curtis as Joe (Josephine) Junior, Jack Lemmon as Jerry (Daphne), and Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. This is a comedy that was a bit out of the ordinary for its time. It blends a lot of sexuality, taboo, comedy, and just down right dirtiness. Some Like It Hot was much entertaining, most likely due to the fact that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are dressed as women for most of the movie. How could that not be funny? Although not being very witty comedy, it involves somewhat of `slap stick' comedy in the movie, which is good for all the viewers how get a kick out of that. It is easy to know why this movie was such a hit. The first scene that Sugar is introduced, she pretty much steals the show and has every guy glued to screen. It was very disappointing to find out that the title of the movie has no meaning whatsoever to what is being seen in the actually film itself. Although what movie with Marilyn Monroe has to have much meaning, honestly? One comes to find out this is an obvious fact when it turns out to be that she plays a UKULELE in a JAZZ BAND for crying out loud. Come on! Overall, the film was entertaining. I give it 7 out of 10 stars because it was entertaining enough not to put me to sleep. I do not recommend this film to any younger viewer for the use of extensive sexual innuendoes and sexual humor.",Null,0,4,16 April 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," Terrific
","People often forget the true meaning of Christmas. It's not about getting presents or going shopping; it's about what God has gifted you with. Not taking things for granted and appreciating what someone already have. Frank Capra's film It's a Wonderful life is a masterpiece reminding the people who watch it to think twice about what they've received. The characters are lovable and anyone could fall in love with this movie.
        This film was made post World War II and the American people really movies that touched their emotions and made them feel good.The story starts with George Bailey (James Stewart) who has had anything but a good time and things aren't exactly going his way going down hill. Everyone in the town of Bedford Falls is praying for George to make it through his dilemma. Angels who are represented by constellations of stars or galaxies get together to talk over what they should do. Clearance (Henry Travers) who is an angel who has yet to get his wings is called and is informed about George and is then told of his life. The movie cycles through his life as you watch George and his family struggle to keep their business afloat from the corrupt Mr. Potter. George never seems to be content with his personal possessions but always longs for materials. George has always had the big dreams to travel Europe and the rest of the world his whole life but are all crushed when his father passes away. He is the only left to keep the building and loan running and he is made to see that you don't need all the money in the world to be rich. George struggles to see this until his guardian angel is sent down to help him. This movie will make a person feel things that most films would never make them feel. It really makes a person think of how much movies can sometimes be a work of art, molding and shaping characters and putting you on an emotional roller coaster. This movie gives an awesome life lesson and I would recommend it for all ages.
         This film gets a 9.5 out of 10 because it has to be one of the best movies ever made. The casting was terrific, the plot and storyline were absolutely wonderful. This film plays with your emotions and touches your heart. Brings up good points about how the world is so stuck on itself.",10,1,5,16 December 2003
Psycho," Genius
","This psychotic thiller is a work of genius by the director Alfred Hitchcock. Made in 1960 this film was well ahead of its time.  The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a curious motel manager, Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, and John McIntire as Sheriff Al Chambers.Psycho forever changed the way films were made in Hollywood.  Alfred Hitchcock's genius shaped this masterpiece in such a way to draw the viewer in and keeping them on the edge of their own seat.  With his experience in movie making, Hitchcock knows just how to influence and play with the mind.Alfred Hitchcock is considered `The Master of Suspense,' and has earned that name rightfully.  He created movies that one would have to watch over and over again in order to get all the little details of a film. Psycho is a perfect example of that, using lighting and camera angles to give the watcher a feeling of being anxious, scared, or weary of what is about to happen.  One might notice that when any certain scene is shown, the camera gets closer and closer to the actor or actress's face, making it very uncomfortable to watch.  Every aspect of this film is amazing for it's time, with a score that has been nominated to be one of the top 100 most influential pieces of music in American history. 
Overall, I give Psycho a 9 out of 10 stars, for being a good movie in general.  It's a powerful film that goes deeper than just scaring people. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves old horror classics.",9,4,7,20 February 2004
Rear Window," Something different
","Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece `Rear Window,' was something a bit different for the time. Known as the master of suspense, Hitchcock, used camera angles, plot structure and an overall atmosphere to give a sense that you're in the movie. `Rear Window' was filmed on only one set and in one room making this movie truly unique. This movie stars James Stewart as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Wendell Corey as Lt. Thomas Doyle and Thelma Ritter as Stella. All of who give a wonderful performance and gibe the story life. Jeff, who is the main character in the movie, is a professional photographer who travels the world and is unfortunately stuck inside his apartment because of a broken leg hi had received. This film is viewed from his prospective as he views his neighborhood and his fellow neighbors. Hitchcock's choice of music was very interesting for this film because there is none, or at least no official sound track. All music that was used in the film was from his near by neighbors, or music playing on the street, which in turn was in sync with what was going on. This films battles a lot of controversy over ethics and morals as James Stewart `peeps' out his windows of his apartment, is it okay? Is it wrong? Although Hitchcock is known for his fantastic horror movies, this is a great mystery movie to watch. Hitchcock did a great job casting this film, James Stewart was a perfect choice, because many viewers at the time felt like they could identify with him. This film really gets you hooked and making you ask what exactly is next. I give it 8.5 out of 10 stars, for the spectacular work put into making the set of `Rear Window' and also the great job the performers and Hitchcock putting together this movie.",7,1,3,1 March 2004
The Godfather," Well done
","The Godfather, an electrifyingly well made film. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, just naming the heavy hitting stars. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia family living in New York. The Don's main source of income is gambling and protection. Another head of another mafia family (Sollozzo) wants to sell drugs to gain profit, Don Vito hates the idea of selling drugs on the market, so an attempt to take his life is made. One special son of the Godfather is brought to light when this event happens. In the film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the films gives the viewer a feeling of sympathy for a mob family, when in reality, a person does not usually take the side of a mob family, doing things against the law to make profit. A couple of the ways this happens is the fact that it's felt that Don Corleone is trying to do the `right' and `honest' way to make his profit by not selling drugs. Also, by the death and injury of many family members, the film brings a feeling of understanding, sympathy, and compassion towards the Corleone's. The film includes numerous scenes of murder, often in an offensive amount. Some scene feature hideous lights jobs, to the point of not seeing the character's faces, or telling what is happening. Although very monotonous, the music and soundtrack the movie was well done, and really changed the feel of individual scenes. There was an excellent job of doing crescendos and making diminuendos of certain scene to build suspense, or foreshadowing an event. Overall, the acting was superb, great casting, very well conceived and structured plot. I give The Godfather 8.5 out of ten.",8,0,2,21 May 2004
