The Avengers," It is a great movie...
","This many reviews can't be wrong and now I'm part of that group. I won't spoil it with much details but the script is good, the directing is great and the action is just amazing. The biggest surprise for me was Mark Ruffalo's part. I was highly skeptical because of his look and the Hulk's but after seeing the entire movie I have to agree that he is the best Hulk version thus far. I am simply amaze at both Weldon and Mark's work. Just wow.The are two disappointing things for me though. First is Hawkeye. He's only smiles once in the movie and I bet you'll have a hard time finding that part. This is because I've grew up knowing Hawkeye more as a comedic/serious character and not just a pure serious character. That doesn't mean his part in the movie wasn't great. Second is Banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside the team. Sure one can make guesses but I much prefer that one was provided; either as Hulk wanting to protect others as he usually does, or as Banner and Hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept him. But even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives. That was just jaw dropping for me and the Avenger teammates LOL I have to suggest to those that haven't already watched the movie to pay close attention to the dialog's. Many of the lower reviews, especially from film critics, is because they really don't pay attention to the dialog's and rate it down. Plus, you'll see why I enjoyed the Hulk immensely in this movie.Many people are turned off on the fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the so-called hardcore comic fans. I will have to remind everyone here that for most comic superheroes the big, world killer scenarios are from outer space, from aliens. It doesn't matter if it's DC or Marvel, it's exact SAME situation. It's not a copy of Transformers 3 since Michael Bay made up the story in the first place and did a poor job at it. Transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for ages.Don't be surprise but eventually Superman will have Doomsday and his portals. Green Lantern is guardian of the UNIVERSE, don't see how one gets upset at an Alien force coming in to destroy Earth or any other planet that is in their area of protection. Batman and the Justice League will have their Aliens and so forth. Really, what are you complaining about then? That there are too much Aliens? How are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story? That's what I thought. Mindless comic book fans that 'think' they know better...pffft.If you're happy with just the superhero fighting human villains on and from Earth fine. Stay that way. But don't go bitching because eventually the story of ALL superheroes will involve aliens. You're precious Batman will involve aliens, it's just not there in the form of movies YET. Joker has a big part in aliens and Earth's destruction. Get with it people.As for people complaining about the lack of character development well the answer is simple. Go and watch the respective movies about the super hero you are disappointed about. There are two Iron movies, 2 Hulks, One captain America, One Thor. And while Black Window and Hawkeye don't have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them. They are the less popular heroes of the team that's why. So again, why are people even complaining about this issue in the first place?Seriously though I sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly, even hardcore fans.",9,6,13,28 April 2012
