Hereditary," Good use of light and stillness....
","...which is what made the film good in its delivery to be nervous to watch. But alas not much of that either for this viewer. It is garnered as a generation The Exorcist, or The Shining, but both have their own style that delivers far better quality. The closest to story for me is similar to Rosemary's Baby, but that was worth merit due to great actors and story (even though the director is an arsehole). Don't worry - there's no spoiler for anyone in that remark. Given some scenes which were great little tense bits (son refusing to look in rear vision mirror, the dark halls with natural feeling light of a moonlit sky) does come across par excellence, but I did snicker at some bits that I'm sure I wasn't meant to snicker at. I also wanted more from Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne - actually, I wanted a lot more from him, but neither were that convincing. Milly Shapiro was just ... ok. The best was the son played by Alex Wolf, but I'm not sure if any of the actors weren't replaceable- which to me says that casting wasn't quite right. I loved the dynamics of the film - top marks for that. Story was so-so, but it wasn't the film I thought I'd like. In the end, someone will make a better version of something of this sort soon.",7,2,4,19 June 2018
Ready Player One," No return (was there ever a return to have??)
","There is this constant hype regarding Spielberg's supposedly return to form, albeit a return to the 80's style fantasy sci-fi work. But this man has given more in movie making than this stuff (Color Purple, Saving Private Ryan). But these movies are also about the ACTORS. Spielberg's stories are basic stuff. Nothing that isn't formulaic, but he directs in his way with a good cast at the helm which makes for a better movie experience than his input. Which is one reason why I twitched and fretted and got annoyed so much throughout this film. The actors were so dull. The hero frets about her birthmark. The dull boy who solves the puzzles doesn't even go to school. How did he even read? Oh, that's right - there is no reading in this dystopia! Now that is dystopian (Ray Bradbury has better dystopian fables in his little pinky). The ending was magnanimously tiresome. Trite, garbage and not even sentimental (which honestly would've been a tad better). The actors looked dulled and transfixed on ending their scenes because none of them were engaging. The Walking Dead extras would've been more interesting when they are dead than these actors. So who's fault is that? Everyone's - casting, directing and producing. I have no doubt the book is good, but so was Schindler's Ark (which has since been retitled as List). So we can't blame the source. What always seems to be the issue with people's romance is like having a body of a Ferrari but the engine is a lawnmower. We all have the tendency to overdramatise our desires in having something substantial, and I never thought Spielberg was able to deliver this. You've seen Jaws recently (and it is far better than this movie because of the actors)?So what we are left with is an overindulgent unsatisying movie that really has no point nor any nostalgia for the ones who went through the western version of the 80s, or even let the younger generation get gravitas of what some things in pop culture were really like. It must be like what it is as being presented to me as the 60's (ie, nothing of the sort). I wasn't alive then, so I get a very diluted second hand account. Hell, without Michael J Fox, this movie was doomed to fail for me anyway. It's ALWAYS the acting in Spielberg films that succeed (Drew Barrymore was more engaging than the plastic alien). Spielberg is not the auteur that some people want him to be (and he himself does not perceive this either). But it has to be said that when you see a movie like this, you'd even welcome a fake mechanical shark because at least it looked better than the cartoon we were shown throughout. I feel like the whole world is kinda trapped in an arrested development. We need to have grown up stuff - that's what I liked as a kid (look at Warner Bros cartoons!!). With a movie like this it should've been grown up!!P.S: I'm not giving spoilers away in this report, but I was so disappointed that the movie did for The Shining. Damn, I was with my 12 year old and I wanted him to see THAT film when he's older with me. Now,the best bits have really been shown in this Ready Player One. They really could've mentioned that before you watched it (ie: this movie contains The Shining spoilers....)",1,2,6,17 April 2018
The Lost City of Z," You can't get into it.
","The story, fascinating as it is based on a true life, is hard to pin down and get into it. No time did I feel trapped and feel exhausted by empathy while watching this film, although I am sure shooting this film would have been torturous. For that reason, they could've used real life events on film to incorporate the tension of going through a jungle would be like (especially the amount of gear you need).
It really lacks in any emotional punch - nowt. It would have the actors at breaking points with filming in such conditions, then why not use this to the viewer's advantage? You need that sort of exploitation to tell this particular story.It was far too comfortable.
 
How did they ever keep on travelling back? To and fro throughout the film, and nothing of these particular journeys except of some parts of getting 'there' (many theres in this film).Too big of a life for such a small film. Fixate on one aspect of life I would suggest - just pick one of these events and pull out the emotional and physical effort needed to draw on.
In the end, dull - I am sure not because of the effort of crew and actors. But it was dull.",4,1,3,5 July 2018
Baby Driver," Bang bang boredom
",That's really it. Nothing else but a stylistic Play Station based movie. Yawn. And goodnight,1,5,9,14 September 2018
Joker," It could've been so much better...
","The power of hype got to me this time. Well, to be fair I like The Joker as a villain, especially the way Heath Ledger played him. But that was half the effort. The other half was Christopher Nolan.This one was going to be good, or so I had hoped. Joaquin Phoenix was great, but not brilliant. That should've been harnessed by the director, Todd Phillips. But he didn't get it.Do you remember the main plot for the joker in The Dark Knight? He lured Batman away from the boats. Very clever and such a genius. But we never see this here. Not an ounce of cleverness.Two murders. That's all. That's all we got. Maybe says something about me (says something about a lot of people), but there was no where near enough violence not malice that the Joker has. And what age is he meant to be in this film? Because he's obviously found the fountain of youth since he met Bruce Wayne as a kid before his folks get killed, and so when we get the stories of him being Batman's arch enemy he must be hitting his 70's!!!All in all,I was underwhelmed. What a shame because I loved JoaquÃ­n's portrayal. Needed most of this story dealt with in the first 30 minutes, and the rest in his revenge.Side note: Robert de Niro was useless. Terrible acting!!",7,4,16,9 October 2019
