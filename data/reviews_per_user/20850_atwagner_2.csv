Gremlins," Joe Dante Does It Again
","The greatest director, Joe Dante, makes another masterpiece. While not as good as Gremlins 2 The New Batch, this film is still amazing. Its a true masterpiece that caused the creation of Gremlins 2 The New Batch and thats why it's so important. Thank you Joe Dante, I'll be back for Gremlins 3.",10,1,2,24 January 2019
Avatar," Gremlins 2 The New Batch Was Far Better
",James Cameron cannot compare to legendary director Joe Dante. The blue aliens of this movie feel like nothing but a cheap imitation of the gremlins from Gremlins 2 The New Batch. The CGI was subpar and could not compare to the special effects of Gremlins 2 The New Batch. The ending was predictable and I feel like this movie just copied its name from the shoe Avatar The Last Airbender to get more viewers. This movie was not a masterpiece but a speck of dust in the mountain that is Gremlins 2 The New Batch.,1,5,7,24 January 2019
