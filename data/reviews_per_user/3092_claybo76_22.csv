The Blair Witch Project," It freaked me.
","After hearing the hype for months, TBWP finally opened in Australia.  I tried to keep an open mind, ignoring people who were really scared by it, or adversely thought it was totally boring.  I really enjoyed it.The whole concept of the film is probably its best feature.  It was extremely well marketed, prompting some people to think that it was real footage.  You believed that you were watching three students lost in the woods, experiencing genuine fear and anger.  Anyone who has ever camped in a forest will relate to strange noises in the night, and how scary they can be. It isn't for the unimaginative, who has seen every scary gory horror flick, and wants to have everything laid out for them.  Your own imagination is what makes this film so frightening.  Aside from personal opinions on how scary it is, the concept is excellent.  Very original and simple.  One of the lowest budgeted films to come out this year, but very entertaining, proving that you don't need mega-bucks to tell a good story, or give people a few moments of terror.I was freaked out by it more than I realised.  Especially when night fell tonight, and I walked to my car.  Recommended for those who want something different, but it is worth seeing, just so you can say that you've seen it.",7,0,0,11 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How can anyone be disappointed?
","Shame on all the Star Wars 'fans' that have bagged this movie.  I cannot believe some people who have written on this site, calling themselves Star Wars fanatics, and then labelling it a great film, but a bad Star Wars film. Another comment concluded that the movie was aimed at 14 year old boys. Hello?  The trilogy were family films made like Disney/action/adventures. Of course the prequel will be in the same vein. Someone else dared to say that the Special Editions spoiled the original trilogy!!If you people are such fans of George Lucas and the world he has created, he is owed more respect.  I grew up with the Star Wars films.  I can't imagine a world without them.  I was thrilled to hear of the Special Editions. New scenes!  Better effects! Superior sound and vision!  What Star Wars fan could be happier for Mr Lucas, who got to make his vision a reality, finally.  He was never totally happy with the films, and he had to wait for technology to catch up with him before he could make the prequels.  It also gave me the chance to see all the films in the cinema.  An experience I won't forget.The Phantom Menace is a brilliant film.  Fantastic effects (of course), great action sequences, comedy, suspense, wonderful acting, the works!  It delivered the opening chapter in a fun and exciting way.  Any true fan was picking up clues to the next prequels, delighting in seeing old characters, remembering other lines, etc etc.  It was well worth the wait.  I can't wait for the next two.Do yourselves a favour.  If you don't like this movie, don't call yourself a Star Wars fan.  Call yourself a dictating purist who was so fussy that they want to call George Lucas himself and tell him what the film should have been.  Get over it.  The only people with any right to dump on this film, are the ones who have never seen a Star Wars movie, or have never liked a Star Wars film.  They will never understand.  You disappointed 'fans' should know better.  I can sympathise if you didn't like Jar Jar, but hey, it is essentially a kids' film.All in all. This is a fantastic film. I can't believe the amount of bad reviews and negative comments it has received.  In the end, I suppose, it is up to the individual.  See it for yourself!",6,0,0,2 June 1999
Ali," Moments Of Being The Greatest
","The best thing in Ali is the acting.  Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, Mykelti Williamson; everyone in the cast gives a great performance.  The worst thing is the length of the film.  It goes for nearly three hours and it drags (it felt like Lord Of The Rings went for two hours) due to some long, boring sequences.  We want to see Ali fight, or hear him launch verbal attacks at a press conference or finding out about some major incident in his lifetime.  Instead we get to see Ali running around in Africa for nine minutes (which feels like twenty) and we suffer through pointless montage sequences which make no sense.  This had the makings of being another Raging Bull, but it just isn't as entertaining.  Will Smith does carry some of the film, as you put up with the slow parts to see more of his performance. It also felt like parts of the movie wanted to deal more with Malcolm X or the Black Muslims than Ali himself.  It needed more focus, quicker pacing and more character depth.",6,1,2,3 March 2002
Fight Club," I am Jack's rising level of disgust.
","Fight Club is the most underrated film ever.  It's lack of critical acclaim, box office success, awards and nominations astound me.  Perhaps because this film dares to be different, and brave enough not to stick to the golden rules of Hollywood film making.  Boasting brilliant performances from the two leads - as well as the rest of the excellent cast - FC transports the viewer into a disturbing journey through violence, insomnia, pain, relief, anarchy and alienation.  Which is not to say that FC is without it's charm and humour.  David Fincher - who is only getting better in my opinion - steers this film into his own cave of cinema brilliance, with inspired moments and dazzling visual scenes.  He constructs visions of confusion, mania and realisation with the ease of the film genius that is David Fincher. From the opening credits this film had me.  I couldn't look away from the screen. 
This movie is THE best film to come out of 1999.  The fact that it got ignored by the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and other such awards fills me with disgust.  A token Sound Effects Editing Oscar nomination proves that Hollywood has no place for films that challenge our senses, which don't treat the audience like three-year-olds and spoon-feed them plot lines.
Edward Norton is still to get his credit for being one of the best actors in movies today.  I hope that one day he gets the accolades he deserves.  Brad Pitt is not just a pretty face either, and lately he has been showing how good an actor he really is.  This timeless classic will only be appreciated by the few of us in the world who recognise the brilliance in this film.  Until people are ready to open their minds, FC will always be underrated.  This is an excellent movie.",10,0,1,21 February 2000
Memento," Very Innovative!
","What a great idea for a story, and a great way to tell it.  You can't turn your brain off with this one.  Every scene makes the previous scene make sense, and if you switch off you miss vital plot developments. 
The film is all down to Guy Pearce and the incredible editing.  His sincerity and complete believability in the role of Leonard is fantastic. How this film didn't get more notice is beyond me. The fact that it didn't pick up the Oscars for editing and original screenplay is baffling. 
I just know that I'm going to be doubting what is real in my memory for a few days.  Recommended for those who like to think, and want to break from the typical Hollywood blockbuster no-brainer.  Well done Mr Nolan!",10,0,1,20 April 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Delivers Again
","I was so impressed with what Tim Burton had done to The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.  Anyone who has read the story, or is familiar with it, will know that Headless Horseman wasn't real at all.  Which is why this movie works so well - the Headless Horseman is very real indeed.You put Johnny Depp together with Tim Burton and you get gold.  This is no different from their other collaborations.  Brilliant mood, art direction and costuming makes you feel like you are watching the Disney cartoon come to life. I was applauding Burton's nod to Disney's animated short with an almost exact replication of Brom Bones throwing the flaming pumpkin at Ichabod Crane.Andrew Kevin Walker changed the story for the better.  If they had remade the original story, people would have been bored to tears.  This is a wonderful action film that is filled with great imagery, human emotion and quirky humour.  Highly recommended.",9,0,0,3 December 2000
Snatch," Another Gem
","What a follow-up to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels!  It's the closest thing to a sequel without being one.  The same kind of humour, similar characters and more harrowing situations.   Guy Ritchie has such a visual style that gives his films such energy!  The opening character introductions are fantastic and cleverly edited together.  Sure, the story is nothing new, and the characters are stereotypes, but it is heaps of fun. It is on par with LockStock and the two make an excellent double feature.  How many quotes and one-liners can you and your friends swap from these films?  Great cast, great storytelling and great fun!",9,1,1,10 July 2001
Full Metal Jacket," An incredible piece of film making!
","One of Kubrick's best films, and probably his most accessible.  His deliberate slow-paced style is less of a feature with every scene holding your interest.  A lot of people say that the first forty minutes is all that's worth watching but the rest of the film contains many satirical and political comments of the stupidity of the Vietnam War.  The boot camp is definitely the strongest section due largely to excellent performances from R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio.  All in all an excellent film about the horrors of war with Matthew Modine in an underrated role.  Arguably the best war film ever made.",10,0,0,21 August 2000
Ratatouille," It wasn't crap, but it wasn't brilliant.
","A fairly likable film, but I feel that Ratatouille is undeserving of the high praise heaped upon it. Number 129 in the IMDb Top 250? Are you kidding me? Above Toy Story 2? Above Finding Nemo? Above The Incredibles (arguably the finest animated movie ever)? And, I'm not the world's biggest fan of it, but above The Lion King? The only area that Ratatouille is superior to any of the afore-mentioned films is the excellent, realistic animation and the innovative 'action' sequences. Character development? Minimal. Laugh-out-loud moments? Reserved for the last twenty minutes...the biggest redeeming feature of the film (well done Mr O'Toole). Silly plot twists? Check. Overkill of a premise? Check. Speaking English with newspapers in French? Check. Overdone physical 'comedy'? Check. Pointless violence? Check.I think a little more time needed to be spent on the script and not how well it was presented. I didn't feel much of a connection to any of the characters, and did not become emotionally involved with Remy until the end of the film. However, this isn't a BAD film, it's just disappointing. Brad Bird's Incredibles saga was a hugely engaging, entertaining and funny film, and this is not. I know a lot of people may disagree with me (129th??), but I felt this fell way short of the bar. Bring on The Incredibles 2 and let's give thanks that Hayao Miyazaki is still churning them out. At least Spirited Away is in a fitting place on the Top 250.",5,2,5,7 July 2008
Ocean's Eleven," Fantastic Remake Update!
","A very enjoyable film with fast pacing, funny moments and plot twists a-plenty.  A great cast giving great performances, and a much livelier script than the original 1960 film, make this so easy to watch.  Highly recommended for Soderbergh fans and movie buffs in general.",9,0,0,3 March 2002
The Usual Suspects," One of the best films of all time!
","Finally, a thriller with every major ingredient: 1. A fantastic cast with excellent performances. 2. A director who knows how to tease and excite. 3. One of the most original plots with enough twists to keep you guessing. 4. An ending that totally surprises you.I cannot express enough my love for this great film.  Such a film that you can trade lines with friends (a group of my friends and I love to re-create the line-up scene).  There are moments of thrilling action as well as sublime comedy that put your faith back into great movie-making.  I recommend this fantastic film to anyone who values a great plot, great acting and a great ending.  Previous viewers will agree with me no doubt. Join us.",10,0,1,27 December 1998
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wonderful storytelling!
","A great movie with a plot that just unravels on its own terms.  Great characters and incredible action sequences are the backbone of this fantastic film.  It's also beautiful to watch, with the cinematography wonderfully capturing the lush scenery as well as the dazzling fights.  My only criticism is that the background story of Lo and Jen goes on for too long.  I felt that I wanted to get back to the compound, and follow the rest of the story.  Otherwise, this is an almost flawless film, without the typical Hollywood endings or twists.",9,1,2,3 April 2002
The Game," Totally engrossing!
","One of the most engaging films I have ever enjoyed.  What a terrifying concept.  A game of life and death, and not knowing what part you will play next.  You get to a point where you sympathise totally with Van Orten, and you wonder how the hell he will get his life back.  I loved it.  Michael Douglas is getting better all the time.  A little disappointed that Sean Penn wasn't in it for longer, though.  A great follow up to Se7en from David Pincher.  Unmissable.",8,1,2,4 January 1999
Meet Joe Black," Too long...
","This movie had a promising premise and a great cast.  Unfortunately it was very slow-moving and an effort to watch.  Some scenes were very entertaining, but the story could have been told in almost half the time. That would have also contributed to it being a more enjoyable film. 
I was disappointed by Martin Brest's first effort since Scent Of A Woman, one of my favourite films.  It had none of that movie's fun, emotion or humanity.  Pitt and Hopkins, as always, delivered very fine performances and Jeffrey Tambor impressively showed his serious side.  If you have the time, it's worth a look, but it's no Scent Of A Woman.",5,0,0,10 July 2001
A Bug's Life," A great cartoon Flick!
","Not liking Toy Story very much, I was pleasantly surprised by this very funny film.  Whilst being essentially a kid's cartoon, there are, as usual, some adult jokes in there as well.  All the voices are fantastic, giving life to the animated characters (and even more so in the 'bloopers'). Kevin Spacey was my favourite voice, but they were all excellent.Some real belly laughs here.  I found Antz a little un-funny in parts. The animation wasn't as good as ABL either. It wasn't a very good kid's film. Particularly, the termite battle.  Any kid under four would've screamed in the cinema.  I suppose that's why it was rated PG.ABL is on the best animated films to come out in a long time.  The plot is nothing original, but who cares?  It's funny.  Find the inner child in yourself.",7,0,0,7 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A Film That Keeps It's Mystery
","An excellent film, and very Kubrickesque. Lots of the brilliant director's classic trademarks are in here: the deliberate pacing, zooms, the angle of the close-ups, etc, etc.  What I loved most about this film was that you weren't given a clear-cut answer to anything.  The house, Nick, Mandy, the dream, you could make of it what you wanted. Maybe that's why so many people didn't get it, because they needed it spelt out and spoon fed to them. 
I have been waiting for a new Kubrick film for years. Funnily enough the first film of his I saw was 1987's Full Metal Jacket, which I rate as one of his best.  I loved EWS.  It was everything I hoped it would be.  Well acted, well directed, well written and well shot.  I will never look at a mask again without getting goosebumps.  My only criticism (if any) is that the start was a little slow-paced (what Kubrick film isn't), but that's it. A great movie. Stanley Kubrick RIP.",8,0,1,15 June 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Inventive and Fun
","A great dose of action, comedy and suspense.  Full of great quotes and eccentric characters.  Wonderful use of colour (or lack of it) and different styles and effects.  Very enjoyable and fun film!Just as good as Snatch.  Watch the two films together.  What a fun double! Enjoy!",8,0,0,10 July 2001
Titanic," Could have been better.
","I have to admit that the sinking of Titanic is done extremely well.  It is terrifying to watch, and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see.  Amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras.  You could see that every person aboard was scared.  It was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the Titanic sank, from the computerised sinking shown to old Rose, so you knew it would break in half, and how it would go down, etc.  I felt that added another sense of tension.The love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me.  This kind of terrible scripting and love-you-till-the-end-of-time encounters is now seeping into other movies, eg: Armageddon.  Does anybody honestly think a 'proper' girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons?  Or pull the finger at Hockley's 'henchman' whilst going down the elevator?  Or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard the Titanic?The sketching scene is the only love scene needed.  It is showing us that Rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel, although it is a private moment.  There is an unspoken intimacy between Rose and Jack that is beautiful, and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window.  I'm sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriend/fiancee/wife.On the whole, parts of the film make me twinge, that bloody song, f'rinstance.  As well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting (notice it didn't get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay? - it has been years since a film that won Best Film was nominated for that award). The effects are brilliant, along with the editing and the action sequences.",6,2,3,31 December 1998
The Green Mile," An Incredible Adaptation
","I was riveted to the serial chapters of The Green Mile when Stephen King first published them in 1996 and I was absolutely delighted to learn of the film being made.  I was really hoping that they wouldn't screw it up.  I needn't have worried.This is a brilliant film, and it is as close to perfection as you can get. It is everything I wanted it to be.  The entire cast are magnificent, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan and Doug Hutchinson.  I feel that Michael Jeter's performance was ignored, because he was fantastic.  Tom Hanks, as always, well...the man can do no wrong.  He's an excellent actor.I can only describe this movie as essential viewing.  It will move you so much, if you haven't seen it yet, please take the time.  Be prepared for that lump in your throat, though.",10,2,4,3 December 2000
Casino Royale," Nice overhaul...
","Very enjoyable Bond film. Some of the action sequences suffer from overkill, but are still exciting, if a little convoluted. I was almost ready to blast the movie for not including the James Bond theme, but...oh, you'll have to watch it.Daniel Craig is a great Bond. Full of pith and vinegar, cold and charismatic, sexy and sinister. It's almost as if the opening black and white sequence tells you to forget everything you knew about Bond and the franchise so far...this is Bond re-born, year zero.Once the movie gets into the plot of the original novel, the movie is in full swing. Obviously plot devices such as mobile phones and state-of-the-art MI6 communication have been inserted to modernise Bond, but the story does not suffer for it.I've heard a lot of people say that they hate Bond movies, but they really liked this one. People also comment that they don't like the gadgets either. What the hell? Are the gadgets not one of the most exciting elements of a Bond film? The suitcase in From Russia With Love? The key-ring from The Living Daylights? The Lotus car/submarine from The Spy Who Loved Me? The Aston Martin from Goldfinger? Come on! This is certainly a re-invention, but the lack of some Bond traits disappointed me. Die Another Day was, quite rightly, hailed as the worst movie of the franchise, and CR does set things right again. A wonderful sign of things to come...but please, don't forget the roots of the series. Some things must be updated, but not everything.All in all a very good movie, Bond film or not.",9,0,4,19 June 2007
Heat," An epic masterpiece of 90s film-making!
","It took over 20 years to get Al Pacino and Robert de Niro in another film together, and they get to share screen time!  Only 20 minutes or so, but still, that cafe scene is a classic.  This movie is brilliant, every performance is fantastic, and although it goes for almost three hours, it just flies along!! You get totally enthralled.  You sympathise with every main character's issues, and you don't know which side to go for!  It has it all: classic one-liners, explosive action, plot twists, romance, suspenseful situations, the lot!!One of the most underrated films of the 90s.  In time it will stand as a classic portrayal of the law versus the criminals.  Another great slice of good and evil.",10,0,0,28 April 1999
The Thin Red Line," A great film overshadowed
","It is always a shame when Oscar nominated films fail to get even one award. The Thin Red Line, was just bad timing.  Wedged between two Elizabethan movies and two other WWII films, it was going to be hard pressed to win a major award.  I would've hoped it would have won at least one award out of seven nominations.I really enjoyed this film.  Although I did feel it got bogged down in imagery and soul-searching narratives.  The acting was superb, especially from Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel and Elias Koteas.  The action sequences were terrifying, and I was grateful not to be subjected to any limb-tearing, head-caving graphic scenes like Saving Private Ryan.  The violence was much easier to watch, but just as harrowing.This seemed to be a more human film, as well.  Showing each different soldier's private war, and the way they deal with fight inside, as well as on the battlefield.  Watching the ordeal of the Japanese army revealed them to be as human as the allied forces.  Whereas SPR used the Germans as faceless, almost comic-like villains, TTRL also dealt with the effect of the war on the enemy, rather than concentrating on the 'good guys'.All in all, this a great film.  It shows you the terrifying battlefields of war, the peaceful splendour of the jungle and the spirituality of the men fighting for their country.  It stand as a classic in the years that follow.",8,0,0,22 March 1999
