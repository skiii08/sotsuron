The Lobster," Just say no.
","What a waste of effort from four wonderful actors (Farrell, Reilly, Weisz, Seydoux). How could they have been talked into doing this? It makes no sense, isn't insightful or funny, drags, and leaves you feeling empty. Pick better than we did.We have faces without expression, perhaps the dystopian norm, delivering lines they don't believe. We have absurdities that don't serve what is evidently the plot -- couple falls in love without knowing why. There are slapstick moments that just look like mistakes (group dancing to individual CD players using earbuds, oh haha). And a metaphor, being turned into an animal if things don't go well, that is hammered into the ground. No, I didn't much enjoy it.",2,10,14,4 June 2016
