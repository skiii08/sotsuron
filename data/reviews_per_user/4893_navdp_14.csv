First Man," A rather lengthy biopic in a sombre mood falls short of a must watch.
","Within the first few minutes of the movie you will realise that you are in for a sombre style of film making, which really fails to entertain much. It moves on with the struggles and geniuses of Neil for the rest of 141 mins. Claire Foy demands mention here. Ryan Gosling has failed to dust of his mannerisms and come out of non-serious la la land hero mould.",7,8,13,14 October 2018
Deadpool 2," A movie for adolescent with foul language wherever possible.
","One liners are the only thing that works in the movie. The first part has a good story and makes the audience wait for more. The sequel disappoints, and seems to be a harried one. But you will love the protagonist character as it is so uniquely wonderful.",6,0,3,27 June 2018
Ready Player One," A must watch for VR game enthusiasts and of course Spielberg movies.
",Amazing start...introducing halliday. The concept of Oasis is Wonderful. The part where Samantha is being saved is a bit boring. The revolutionary part is where the master film maker gets back the groove and there is no looking back from then on. A must watch for video game enthusiasts. Some moments and characters linger in ur mind for a long time.,7,0,1,14 July 2018
Horrible Bosses," An adult comedy which fails to tickle ur funny bone.
","Some sequences/scenes in the movie are really funny which gives U a occasional smile. Other than that, movie as a whole is a pint more than a mediocre adult comedy. Definitely a 'once watchable' for a comedy movie.",6,1,3,7 September 2018
Closer," Well, this is not a story about love!!
",Though the posters suggest otherwise it is not a definitive 'love story'. It is a story that shows how love changes into unquenchable lust. And more importantly how the animal behaviour in humans showcases itself.,5,0,0,25 April 2018
Lost in Translation," Annoyingly slow for a 102 min movie.
",A very simple story of two people annoyingly dragged. Characters not defined in entirety. The director seems to have missed the plot in the beginning only to move around rather cluelessly till the end.,6,1,4,5 July 2018
Collateral," Engrossing crime thriller which keeps you interested till the end.
","A Crime thriller which takes place in one night, will stay with you for some time. A movie not very far from being the best in it's genre. Tom cruise in his most non-glamorous role is at his best. Jamie Fox as max is ideal. Music is apt and very catchy most of the times. Characters, though very few, are adequately laid down.",7,0,1,14 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A must watch for all MARVEL Superhero movie buffs ...
","A must watch for all MARVEL Superhero movie buffs, rest if you cannot resist give a try, you may like it. The movie is funny, has a story (does that matter) and carries one of the best Superhero movie villain in the history of movies (probably). He grabs more screen time than most of the SUPERHEROES in the movie. Moreover, Thanos is a villain who also 'cries'. Surprisingly, the story does not end here, i.e, after over 2 hrs. Yes it has a sequel! I would not be surprised if Thanos is made a SUPERHERO. He has the moves, the voice , the power.",7,1,3,4 May 2018
The Piano," A story of marriage, deceit, lust, love, hatred with wonderful music on piano!
",A predictable movie with a not so highly pleasing story line makes this movie a watchable one. Passion of Ada and Baines is worth waiting for.,7,0,1,16 June 2018
The Shape of Water," A good fairy love story
",A fairy love story. The way the story is told is what makes it a definitely a watchable one. Director has tried to address racial and homosexual issues as well in a fairly interesting manner. Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon demand mention here.,7,1,5,12 June 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," An engaging suspense thriller which fails midway.
","An engaging suspense thriller with a strong cast which fails to impress in the end. Not the best of Poirot stories. Starts off superbly with a wonderful character as Poirot, but the story withers away from halfway mark and never comes back.",6,0,1,19 June 2018
Parasite," An excellent story with amazing characters
",A story with interesting characters will keep you glued till the end. It portrays people in the society in a very simple but clear way. A film worthy of the Oscars.,8,1,2,31 March 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Definitely a watchable one for Superhero movie fans.
","The story, action scenes, even the unbelievable demise of Superman was more than watchable....the sombre mode in the whole of the movie defeats the purpose of, otherwise, a good movie.",7,1,2,3 September 2018
Incredibles 2," A little slow at times but a worthy watch nevertheless.
","A well made sequel which carries the same distinctiveness as the original. You would wish more of 'jacj-jack' as the movie progress. A must for animation movie buffs, but brace up for some slackness/slowness at times.",7,3,4,26 June 2018
