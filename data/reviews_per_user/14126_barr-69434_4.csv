Hereditary," A snail on crutches is faster than the pace of this film.
","If you are waiting for a film to be explained you have to wait for quite some time. The only good part in in this film was the accident but all of that was over in five minutes. I wasn't scared at all or creeped out, and the plot doesn't move at a decent pace, I stayed with it all the way through to see if it had a great ending to make up for its poor writing and editing and no it really doesnt. If you are looking for a film to fall asleep to yeah this could be for insomniacs to cure them. But apart from that don't bother.",1,7,13,15 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Don't compare to infinity war and you are in for a good time.
","I don't know why this film is getting one out of tens. I've seen films that are far worse than infinity war and the have scored nines and tens, have you people no sense of taste? Anyway for me I enjoyed this film, I will agree it's not perfect but the pace of the story, the final battle scene and some of the characters stories concluding it tied up the infinity saga well. There were some great comedy moments as well as some emotional fair wells. It didn't feel like three hours as it was entertaining, don't watch with all the hype watch with an open mind as a marvel fan and you will enjoy this film.",8,0,3,15 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Can't believe the hate. One of the best entertaining films I've ever seen.
","I have followed the MCU as most people have since iron man started it all, and sure not all of them have been great (iron man 3 or Thor the dark world comes to mind) but this blew away my expectations. This film was made to entertain and it did just that. With a pretty decent plot and fantastic action scenes it was a visual treat for the eyes.But the main reason why I loved this film was because the good guys lose. It made a change from all of the save the world and stop the bad guy stereotype story. It took an unexpected turn and has you wondering where do they go and what will happen next? 
 
So whether you are just a casual marvel film goer or a die hard fan. This was an enjoyable ride From start to finish, films are made for us to unwind, switch our brains off, and be entertained and infinity war does just that. Its not meant to be taken seriously so I don't know why all the negativity behind it. But an essential film to watch for any movie fan.",10,1,5,21 September 2018
Coco," Great story, great animation just a great film.
","Recently watched this as I was looking for something different from the usual films I watch. Thoroughly enjoyed it, with Pixar's stunning visuals and a really good story all the way through, with some good humour and its family values are in the heart of the film. I'd recommend it to anyone.",9,0,0,24 April 2020
