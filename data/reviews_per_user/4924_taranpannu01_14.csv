First Man," First Man (2018)
","I didn't actually plan to see this film, but I did. This film for me kicks of the incredibly exciting awards season with technological fashion even if the story isn't as compelling as reviewed.Ryan Gosling is a solid lead but I do believe there will be better lead actor performances this year. I often wonder after seeing many Gosling performances where his real personality ends as he comes across as many of his characters. Often looking confused and a bit bland. He gives a decent performance but in my opinion nothing special.Claire Foy on the other hand is the backbone of the picture. She gives an honest and convincing performance as Neil's wife, Janet juggling the domestic life whilst her husband is away wondering whether he will ever return.There is a terrifically secure supporting cast with Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Patrick Fugit, Lukas Haas and Ciaran Hinds giving typically strong performances although one wishes Stoll was used more effectively giving his important role.Disappointingly Justin Hurwitz's score is a massive let down. I didn't care for it one bit and found it bland and conventional.The cinematography was very effective. In a both positive and negative fashion. On one hand, the 60s tone is very well set whilst the colour hue, documentary realism and composition lead to a well shot picture. On the other hand the shaky cam for me was way to much and I am a massive fan of realistic up close, handheld camera compositions. This film had way to much, yes I know it was to create the realistic depiction and showcase the hectic chaos of the shuttle which would then be contrasted by the smooth framing of the moon itself but it was just too much for me.Technically this is a incredibly crisp and well constructed film. Sound is used so effectively whilst production and costume design is incredibly authentic.The silence when in use was used very well and was very effective compared to the at times chaotic audio.The moon landing was stunning and a massive highlight but in my opinion I believe the film should've ended on the moon instead head back to earth clumsily.Overall the film was decent and taught me a bit more about the Armstrong enigma along with the mission to the moon. A decent flick but one that perhaps has been over hyped with tales of Oscar worthy performances and blistering narrative structure. Definitely see the film if you are a Gosling, Foy and Armstrong fan or even if you're just a fan of space and the moon landing. A solid decent motion picture, nothing more, nothing less.",7,0,0,20 October 2018
It," IT (2017)
","Going into this film with previous expectations of the book and original television mini-series this certainly had a bar to reach. Whilst few of the cons can be considered major, the pros are incredibly overpowering and the cons will soon be deemed irrelevant.CONS -The CGI is the most obvious con, in some scenes Bill Skarsgard is completely rendered and any terror that he had in previous scenes has been thrown out of the window. He didn't need to have any special effects in my opinion and would've been more effective if Skarsgard's performance was the main focus.Some of the dodgy CGI also makes some of the children's fears completely non frightening as well as the fact the camera lingers on them for way too long. Subtle cinematography would've been much more effective here.The ending also had me quite conflicted, whilst the idea of bashing Pennywise was fun in the moment, I felt the filmmakers led the audience away from the whole idea of 'sticking together' and just had the children completely kick the shi* out of Pennywise, which was alright but more emphasis on the themes would've been nice.PROS -The opening is absolutely brilliant (if only it wasn't for that CGI face)The performances are fuc*ing brilliant. Standouts being all The Loser's Club. Jaeden Lieberher is fantastic as our main whilst Jeremy Ray Taylor brings such heart to his role. Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer are also completely believable and were among my favourites. Chosen Jacobs also brought an amazingly mature performance although he was vastly underused in my opinion. Wyatt Oleff drew the short straw for me and was overshadowed by his peers. Stephen Boagert and Nicholas Hamilton brought great supporting characters to life.Bill Skarsgard is brilliant when his face isn't being butchered by dodgy CGI, his voice and dribbling were genuinely creepy. The one use of good special effects was that fridge scene. Easily his most terrifying scene is when he creeps up on Bev, I will admit that I jumped.Atmosphere was great as was the cinematography. Andy Muschietti and the rest of his team should be brought back for the sequel!This film does bring a beautiful coming of age story to life more then a fully fledged horror, the children are absolutely brilliant and there is a lot of heart within this. The references are amazing as is the humour. There are some amazing little scenes that play out very nicely that I will leave you to experience for yourself.Overall this film does lack the scares but has plenty of heart and incredible performances across the board to keep your interest. Props to Bill Skarsgard for his performances which brilliantly challenges Tim Curry's but the children should be given the highest of praise due to their mature, emotional, humorous and above all heartfelt performances. I'm already planning a fan cast for Part Two!",8,6,12,16 September 2017
Rocketman," Rocketman (2019)
","Rocketman is a strongly directed, performed and put together cinematic experience about the life of Elton John.Taron Egerton excels as the titular Rocketman with a poignant, soft but still all guns blazing performance. His singing is wonderful and he jumps head first into the role and gives a brilliantly tender soul to the film.Egerton is only as good as his support and my god his support is good. Jamie Bell as Bernie gives for some of the film's most poignant scenes.Bryce Dallas Howard is an inspired casting choice to play Elton's mother and she gives it her best (although it was very clear she didn't do her own singing!)Stephen Graham is just fantastic as usual. Charlie Rowe and Tate Donovan do very well with their limited parts.
Steven Mackintosh and Gemma Jones were great reliable support whilst Richard Madden was brilliant fiendish as John Reid (who was also played by Game of Thrones alumni Aiden Gillen in Bo Rhap and one wonders where he could've taken the role if it was as fleshed out as Madden's).Little Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor were fantastic as little Elton and they deserve as much praise as Taron.The film is so well put together, the way the film is constructed with this circular narrative puts Bo Rhaps' circular structure to shame and although one shouldn't compare, the comparison between these films is hard to avoid, because Rocketman is so bloody brilliant.The set pieces / transitions between scenes are just wonderful, director Dexter Fletcher deserves all the praise for how he has constructed this film. He directed the bloody hell out of this film and deserves all the accolades coming his way.Never been a massive Elton John fan, didn't grow up on his music and that is exactly why I wanted to see this film, everybody I know loved Bohemian Rhapsody for the 'nostalgia' but nostalgia shouldn't overshadow poor storytelling and construction.Rocketman proves you don't need to rely on nostalgia to make a bloody great film.",8,2,3,15 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born (2018)
","Whilst my review is very late to the party (almost three months since it's opening) I am nonetheless excited to say the hype and build up was worth it. A Star is Born is emotional, hefty, warming and ultimately triumphant.Bradley Cooper feels like an assured director and his snub from the Academy Awards is quite frankly a disgrace considering how expertly he directed himself and his co stars. I fell completely in love with Jackson Maine and this was all due to Cooper's gut wrenching and emotional performance.I have to admit I was left feeling underwhelmed with Lady Gaga's performance, yes she was great and completely deserving of her accolades but I couldn't help feel (especially in the more grief stricken scenes) she could've perhaps produced more. Maybe that's me being picky but nonetheless she is still a star and worthy of the recognition she is getting for her surprisingly at times subdued performance.Sam Elliot, Dave Chappelle and Anthony Ramos provide strong back up from the co leads with Elliot being considerably on top form worthy of an Oscar win, he brought gravitas and a steely heart to the picture.The cinematography was just gorgeous, as was the editing. Both played with one another creating a documentary like feel whilst immersing you into the world of Jackson Maine.The themes, references to the modern day music business and emotional beats were all brilliant, one particular scene had me genuinely gasping between Cooper and Gaga.I don't really have much more to say which is odd considering how long some of my other reviews have been. This was a considerable effort by Cooper and he was heavily snubbed by the Academy, one gripe I might add is that I felt maybe the first twenty minutes didn't feel earned, the meeting of Ally and Jackson felt a little TOO Hollywood but this feeling soon went away.Overall, an emotional, stunningly shot, impeccably performed remake that has something genuine to say, which is a rarity in modern day cinema.",8,2,3,24 January 2019
Aquaman," Aquaman (2018)
","Another late screening for a film released last year, I wasn't dying to see it but had heard great and exciting things about the film and caught a late screening with my best friend to which we cackled and laughed throughout almost the entire film and I have no idea if this was good or bad.This film was laughably cringy. The dialogue and delivery by actors was at times awful and head shakingly poor. The slow motion and L'Oreal esque style zooms on the femme fatales were so laughable.The story was there I guess, a sort of swash buckling adventure film. Momoa was Momoa and not really a character. Amber Heard was much better then her shameful appearance in Justice League although some plot points seemed to be created with Arthur not even knowing her name despite meeting each other before and the two seemingly having a history.The supporting cast were surprisingly poor. Willem Dafoe did nothing and you could tell he was immensely bored. Nicole Kidman was bad and I hate writing that as I LOVE her. Her American accent which she couldn't even hold was shocking as well as Temuera Morrison's accent he attempted to put on here and there.Patrick Wilson was suitably over the top and chewing the scenery and he managed to make me laugh with his long drawn out war cries.Dolph Lundgren was there I guess and his third act character shift was so poor. Djimon Hounsou, Ludi Lin and Randall Park were not in the film enough to make an impact. Graham McTavish was probably the least worst, with his suitable powering performance. Michael Beach whom I also enjoy had some disgustingly cringy lines as did his son played by Yahya Abdul Mateen II who portrayed fan favourite Black Manta.The effects at times were great and at other times horrible. The cinematography was decent. The music was decent if not forgettable. Some music choices were so bad, SO bad that they had to be pranking the audience, especially that scene in Italy, we were just laughing our heads off it was unbelievable. This film is so unbelievably cringy that it makes one wonder if what they are viewing is even real.Lord knows how Julie Andrews and John Rhys Davies got into this mess.The imagination was great, props to Wan especially with character designs, creatures and weapons etc.I can't express enough how laughable the film is and this is what worries me as since I was laughing, I technically enjoyed the film at it's own expense so I really have no clue what to rate it. Yes it was enjoyable with the action sequences and frankly superb uses of the long take in those scenes but it was also so hilariously poor.The dialogue which is at times was hard to hear was so expected that I was literally guessing the lines that would come next. Shameful. Another small gripe I had was the fact that the inhabitants of an underwater kingdom had American accents, like really?Everything is over directed, Wan must've been saying on production that everything needs to be bigger, sillier more ridicilious as if this was his only chance to make a superhero film (which it doesn't even feel like).Cringy dialogue, cringy close ups and cringy delivery makes Aquaman a laughably defective but still somehow entertaining few hours.It's a must see rubbish film, like Clash of the Titans or Prince of Persia",5,0,0,4 February 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Ragnarok (2017)
","After actually being quite a fan of the previous Thor movies, I was incredibly excited to hear that Kiwi, Taika Waititi would be directing this as his previous films, 'Boy', 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' were just amazing and incredible works of fiction. This film did not disappoint though it did lack in certain areas.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor Odinson along with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner although I thought we could've seen more Bruce then Hulk. Tom Hiddleston is living it up as Loki and gives yet another great performance as The God of Mischief.Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban and Idris Elba are all fine members of the supporting cast and I actually really enjoyed Urban's English accent and his character in general. Elba is just badass in every sense of the word. Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel House, Clancy Brown, Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth also gave great supporting performances. Props to Taika for bringing in Rachel House his long time friend into this role and she had some great moments.The cameos of Hemsworth, Neill and Damon were just incredible. The humour is just sidesplitting and has Taika written all over it. The action was actually very good considering the Director's lack of experience and The Valkyrie sequence was just visually stunning. The story was simple and easy to follow, the film flowed really well and it was just really really enjoyable.Cate Blanchett was a bit meh for me, she was good but she just wasn't very memorable. Tessa Thompson was just boring. Uninspiring and uncharismatic and sadly that was the result of the actress not the writer. Some of the effects were a bit naff, they were a bit ragdolly and some shots in Norway were clearly a green screen. But that comes with the inexperience of a big budget with Taika.The biggest con of this film was what happened to the Warriors Three as they were legitimately some of the best parts of the previous Thor films. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and especially Tadanobu Asano deserved much more then to be unceremoniously killed off with barely putting up a fight. Such a shame, a massive shame.Overall this film is fun, exciting and a really enjoyable experience, there are some minor flaws that tarnish the overall film but this is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a great boost to brilliant director Taika Waititi.",8,51,91,28 October 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)
","Another film I'm late to review, I wondered if I should even bother reviewing Bohemian Rhapsody, simply because I have nothing fresh to add the wave of mediocre and decent reviews but nonetheless here we are.The film isn't anything special, there are definitely special aspects such as the subject matter and Rami Malek's committed performance but the overall outcome is a sadly mundane biopic that doesn't have the extra star power to make this viewing nothing more then ordinary.The performances are decently committed with Malek of course being the highlight but one should not forget Gwilym Lee and Lucy Boynton who are arguably the backbone of the entire picture. Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Ace Bhatti and Tom Hollander also are worthy of mention with their solid supporting roles.Technically it's a solid film yet again nothing really special of mentioning. Live Aid and perhaps this is because I was not of the generation wasn't as epic and stunning as previously reported, especially with some dodgy cgi work.The entire picture just fell a bit flat, some scenes were so heavily edited (not the musical sequences which were edited to perfection) but the more intimate moments between characters just couldn't help but cut back and forth for honestly quite pointless reaction shots when they should've just let the camera hold for a little longer without cutting.I also wanted to know more, instead of fleshing out (arguably the more boring aspects of Queen's rise) the film decides to just fall into biopic cliches. Before writing this review I took a look at the many inaccuracies the film provided and it's just a tad shameful.A film about Freddie Mercury needs to be a film that Mercury himself would be rushing to see, yes the performances are decent, the music of course is great but that's thanks to the band., the film arguably doesn't deserve the music provided by the great band.I do need to give credit where it's due, the picture went through a hell of production woes and it's a damn good achievement that a film this cohesive is even on our screens but all in all Mr Mercury wouldn't be rushing to see this anytime soon and I can understand why.",6,2,3,27 January 2019
Justice League," Justice League (2017)
","After being in the minority and loving Man of Steel & Batman v Superman but not enjoying Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman this film just came across as completely different and actually quite boring.Pros -Ben Affleck as The Batman is just a genius move. I love him. He is my Batman, shame he didn't get a warehouse sequence in the movie but he is my Batman. He deserves to stay the longest in the Universe and needs his own film trilogy. Amazing. Some scenes of The Batman just turned me into a six year old kid.Henry Cavill is just as good and I have such a soft spot for him as Superman.Jason Momoa is a brilliant move by DC to play Aquaman and he shines in his role even if he isn't given as much to do as the other players.Ray Fisher I loved as Cyborg, he brought humanity and depth and fully deserves a solo movie, or even a Teen Titans movie.Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf I thought was actually pretty good. Whilst the CGI is a mess at times, the character was developed, motives explained and he was quite intimidating. Honestly don't understand the hate for him, commendable job by Hinds to create this character.The supporting cast of Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J.K Simmons, Amber Heard, Joe Morton, Michael McElhatton, Billy Crudup, Jesse Eisenberg and Joe Manganiello are such talents and all shine whether they are given less or more to do. Props to Amy Adams for always bringing her A game along with Lane and Irons.Pacing was actually good although I fully believe they should cut out all the scenes with that stupid Russian family and fleshed out the major players a lot more. That Russian family really annoyed me.Some of the set pieces with the Amazons and the Lord of the Rings esque battle were a joy to watch. Shame we didn't get to see more of David Thewlis as Ares as again with the minority here, loved him.The end credits scene turned me (yet again) into a six year old kid. I just love Deathstroke.Some moments of humour worked but in many scenes just felt cringey.There are some references which are quite fan pleasing such as the name dropping of Roman Sionis, the showing of Green Lanterns and of course the end credits scenes.Cons -Gal Gadot I hate. I'm sorry, there's nothing about her I like, I didn't enjoy her in her film. She just can't. And it bothers me. And I'm sorry but I just don't like her at all.Ezra Miller was good in most parts but some of his humour was very hit and miss.The CGI was actually not as bad as people are making out but seriously a lot more could've been practical. Henry Cavill's CGI face isn't in the movie as much as I thought he would be which is very good.The Russian family should've been ditched for more character development, character's that actually mattered. I really hated them.This film is actually at times quite boring and without any stakes unlike the previous films.I absolutely hate the comedic and light hearted tone of this film. BvS and MOS all were perfect in my eyes in terms of tone whilst SS and WW had more conventional terms which worked. This film just doesn't fit in THE DCEU.(Update) - I completely forget about Danny Elfman's score which really explains how flippin forgettable it was. JUNKIE XL PLEASE COME BACK.Joss Whedon's fingerprints are all over this film and the reshoots are so painfully obvious. Give us the Snyder cut we deserve. The action was actually quite boring and uninspiring. Stick to TV Whedon.I'm not sure if I got a different cut of the film but the opening with the CGI Superman filmed on a phone was legitimately weird.Look overall this film just isn't Zack Snyder's movie, I for one love his stylistic vision and storytelling, MOS and BVS are in my eyes masterpieces that the critics tore for unnecessary reasons. I am a huge Marvel fan as well and it's hard not to draw comparisons with this film and The Avengers. Whedon's touch is all over this film and honestly he could possibly have tarnished the entire DCEU with this installment. If this film was in Snyder's hands it would be more visually fantastic, longer and have real stakes. The rumours of Whedon shooting 20% of this film has to be fake, his fingerprints are all over this decaying body of work which sadly falls flat from previous entries in the DCEU.Pray for The Snyder Cut.",5,2,12,25 November 2017
Yesterday," Yesterday (2019)
","Yesterday is just a charming, heartfelt and often touching film. Superbly directed by Danny Boyle, the film is so much more then a feel good movie.The performances are pitch perfect. Himesh Patel is gold as Jack Malik, not only a great acting performance but his renditions of the classic Beatle's songs are genuinely good. I saw Patel years ago in Eastenders and it's great to see him in this star making turn.Lily James is just a wonder, she is always solid and she is great here as Ellie, funny, cute and just full of charm. The whole film is just charming and likeable, it's an odd description but its true, the whole picture is just so likeable.The supporting cast are amazing. Sanjeev Bhaksar and Meera Syal were glorious as Jack's parents, loved seeing them steal the show. Joel Fry was equally spot on as Rocky, he provides most of the laughs and they are genuinely funny, typical Richard Curtis character in all the best possible ways.I want to give a moment to appreciate Alexander Arnold, I've seen him in quite a few things now 'What Remains', 'The Salvation', 'Capital', 'Save Me' and 'Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool' and he is just a star. He is great here, he is bloody great in everything, a supporting role nonetheless but he is definitely a star and worthy of so much praise.Ed Sheeran, Kate McKinnon, James Corden, Sophia Di Martino, Ellise Chappell, Harry Michell, Sarah Lancashire and Justin Edwards were all solid support but the aforementioned cast members are truly the stars.We head into MAJOR spoiler territory now so be warned:Robert Carlyle as John Lennon was heartbreaking. The scene itself isn't sad but it was just such a beautiful surprise. Lovely. Absolutely lovely.The cinematography and editing should be praised, Danny Boyle is a fine director and once again brings a fantastic style to the film.The story actually contained a few surprises, I loved how it wasn't just The Beatles that disappeared from reality.The film had such a nice ending and such a nice message, the fact that Jack goes on to reveal he didn't write those songs and becomes a music teacher to just carry on the legacy of their music to the next generation was really poignant. The whole concept is quite poignant and touching which the trailers don't really sell which was a nice surprise in my opinion.The film is filled with heart, love and such poignancy. I really can't compliment it enough, Richard Curtis has once again produced a charming script that is actually quite layered whilst Danny Boyle has amassed a great ensemble to bring a fantastically feel good movie to life.Don't listen to those criticising the film for being 'silly' and 'cheesy' watch the picture yourself and understand the deeper layers Curtis has penned within his script. This touching film is a what if scenario..what if one man remembered the Beatles when no one else did...but it's also about so much more.",8,0,1,15 July 2019
1917," 1917 (2019)
","A pure cinematic achievement. I was only born when the first The Lord of The Rings (2001) came into theaters and I truly believe I am feeling how the rest of the world did when they first saw Middle Earth.1917 is a breathtaking, heart pulsing and technically outstanding film that based on its creation alone, deserves your attention. This film is beyond words, direction, cinematography, performance, editing, sound are all at the highest of qualities.Recently knighted (and deservedly so) Sam Mendes has crafted a masterpiece, his magnum opus, a personal film for him that follows admittedly a simple story that follows war film beats that we are familiar with but the presentation of this beats are anything but simple.The direction and creation of this film is beyond anything I've seen, it is a true experience. Roger Deakins (if he hasn't already) cements himself as the best cinematographer of all time, aided by editor Lee Smith's crafty tricks.Sound is used superbly, at times it is loud, boisterous but Mendes knows how to use the nuance of sound and does so when needed. The costume and overall production is acute and precise with attention to detail being of upmost importance.The score was great although I did find a lack of cohesiveness with it.The performances are sublime, George MacKay proves himself yet again after star making turns in Pride (2014) and Captain Fantastic (2016). Dean Charles Chapman from Game of Thrones fame is great in his role but I believe he still has a way to go.Strong nuanced support from Mark Strong (as usual), Daniel Mays, Andrew Scott, Adrian Scarborough Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth. Whilst Richard Madden is the cherry on top appearing in the final scene.Historically it was great to see Sikh soldiers (my own religion) after being omitted from Dunkirk (2017) despite their relevance in the events.This film is just a great feat of filmmaking. At one point I cried purely because of how brilliantly this film was made. Sam Mendes has created a cinematic masterpiece, one that must be seen to be believed, I urge everyone to see it as it is some of the purest, brilliant and unbelievable filmmaking in recent memory.It will be long before another film, let alone a war film leaves its audience the way it did mine. Heart racing literal hours after viewing, hands trembling but completely and utterly appreciative of the gifted filmmaking we bore witness to.1917 is a gift to cinema.",10,1,3,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)
","I've never been the biggest Star Wars fan, Rogue One to me is the best film in this considerably bloated franchise. I enjoy these films for their campy fun but I think now Star Wars has run dry. This film whilst it kept me entertained throughout just lost me due to the wasted plot potential.Daisy Ridley is such a talent and I am usually enthralled whenever she appeared on screen.John Boyega is also such an incredible actor although I wish he was given more to do.By far Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron is my favourite of the new characters as I hope he gets a more central role in the final installment of this trilogy.This film has a strong supporting cast with Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Gwendoline Christie, Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro. Whilst each of these actors give their best they're characters are completely wasted. Honestly disappointed with how most of these characters are just discarded.Andy Serkis is as always amazing yet his character is just unceremoniously thrown away.Poor Domhnall Gleeson deserves much more then to be a basic runt of the litter officer even though he is meant to be General he is just treated by trash by both the characters and the writers of this new Saga.Gwendoline Christie better come back, swear to god JJ.Del Toro and Dern were great characters but they just needed more screen time for their effects to be fully felt and their arcs to be really recognised.The visual effects, cinematography and music are clean, pristine and mean. Stunning scenes on the planet Crait with William's score forever soaring. I just wish his score felt a little more recognisable then the other films.Mark Hamill is just meh. Could he ever really act? No. Is he better? I guess.This is Carrie Fisher at her best which sadly isn't saying much.Adam Driver I can not get around, I can't stand him to be honest. Respect the actor, hate the character.Kelly Marie Tran Was fine I guess, didn't love her, didn't hate her. I did hate that damn kiss though. Everyone knows Finn should be with Poe.The new planets are fine and well constructed although with some green screen issues especially on Canto Bight. There was also this really unsubtle reference to animal cruelty which was laughable, Johnson clearly trying to tug on the heartstrings but failing to do so.Motive is kind of thrown out the window in this film so don't expect much reasoning for character's actions.Yoda's appearance was fan service. Simple. I enjoyed it, but fan service nonetheless.In it's entirety this film is considerably entertaining and good to look at. The passing of Luke Skywalker felt kind of anti climatic but it does provide an interesting set up for Episode IX (christ) even if many promising plot points such as Who Is Snoke, Who Are Rey's Parents, along with many characters such as Snoke himself, Phasma, DJ, Holdo have been discarded.This film is a let down due to the wasted potential (along with some incredibly cheesy dialogue and forced attempts at humour) but entertaining nonetheless. It may seem like I hated the feel, I just personally prefer the gritty, contained harshness of Rogue One which had subtle performances much unlike this entertaining whirlwind of wasted potential.",6,1,2,24 December 2017
It Chapter Two," IT: Chapter Two (2019)
","I've been deciding whether the film was a 7 or a 6 and for now it's a 6. The positives outweigh the negatives, the sort of criticism that came from when the film was first released perhaps has influenced my judgement when I saw the film and I agree with a lot of the points.IT Chapter 2 is decent, it's funny, it attempts to have heart (which for some reason I just don't feel like it delivered on and it came across quite cheesy).Andy Muschietti clearly has a love for the source material and creates a sequel that benefits solely from it's strong cast. Some scenes seem overly directed and crammed with stylistic decisions that don't further narrative.The script seems a little muddled, there are some utterly brutal sequences, some incredibly funny sequences and some cheesy moments. It's sort of all over the place, whereas the first film had a strong foundation of a coming of age horror film.The cast as I said is incredibly strong, Chastain,McAvoy, Mustafa, Ryan and Ransone are all great with of course the stand out being Hader, although personally I believe the child actors Martell, Oleff, Wolfhard, Lillis, Jacobs and Taylor were somewhat better with my favourite being Jack Dylan Grazer.Bill Skarsgard is great when he's not being screwed with special effects. Should've left him alone and let him perform without any unnecessary CGI.The special effects were a little iffy, I think the deaging (and refatting of Ray Taylor) were jarring whilst other visual effects were just silly and didn't have the effect I believe they intended. Looking at you severed Stanley head.The cinematography was decent whilst there were some odd editing cuts with some reaction shots but this was forgivable.The score should be commended. King's cameo was a bit cringey which I think can be said with the ending, it all feels a little bit wet and cringey.The runtime didn't feel as long as I thought it was although the ending dragged on. The scares were few, this is down to the silly effects and the reliance on CGI.Overall this is a decent perhaps forgettable sequel that I think suffers from the glory of it's predecessor, Muschietti, his crew and cast should be applauded for their commitment in telling this story which I believe does the novel justice if not losing some cinematic flair in the process.",6,0,3,15 September 2019
Black Panther," Black Panther (2018)
","This film defied the expectations of the superhero film. Intimate, yet grande. Personal yet universal. This film was fantastic and nearly without flaw. As usual a pro's and con's list.Cons -Ryan Coogler is inexperienced when it comes to CGI so it's acceptable that his first mega budget feature film would have some dodgy CGI and this really only comes into the third act.The kiss between Nakia and T'Challa was iffy.And literally that is it, everything else about this film was brilliant.Pros -Chadwick Boseman is the King of Wakanda. He is brilliant, conflicted, nuanced and powerful both physically and emotionally. A King was born in Civil War and he has kept that title.Michael B Jordan was also very good (though not as good as everyone has claimed) in his role. You understand his motives and his scenes with his father were seriously emotional.Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were impeccable as Nakia and Okoye. Both had great scenes, fantastic dialogue and it was great too see two powerful women of colour in leading roles.Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke were also in respectable roles. Kaluuya working very well with what he was given and Duke rising through the scenes he shared with strong A listers.Angela Bassett and Letita Wright were great as T'Challa's family. Bassett wasn't really given much to do but was very realistic within the more emotional scenes. Wright was also very entertaining to watch and the future implications for her character are very exciting. Yet another star is born.Forest Whitaker, Sterling K Brown, John Kani, Seth Carr, Denzel Whitaker and Atandwa Kani were among my favourites. They all brought raw emotion, gravitas and pure empathy for their characters. Brilliant work.Finally, Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman were given less to do but were solid within their roles. I just can't help but feel Serkis was a little wasted in the MCU but still nevertheless very entertaining and always fun to watch.Side note it was great too see Alex R Hibbert (Little from Moonlight) in a small role.Wakanda is so beautiful and glorious to watch as is the action that unfolds within.The humour was perfect and in the right places. Very pleased it was not overbearing.The opening was breathtaking and had me on edge.Some of the dialogue such as Killmonger's final line were completely riveting.The entire spiritual side of this film was so beautiful and emotional it was so glorious to see this side of a superhero and it made for some genuine raw emotion.The costumes were brilliant as were the weapons and the cultural tribes of Wakanda.The social commentary was the most important and honestly breathtaking parts of the film. The way it was current and fresh was just so right and Coogler has really made this film his own. The commentary on certain events just felt so right to include within this film.Overall this film was just so damn good. The racial / social commentary was so relevant, the action sequences were so exciting, the cast are all on point and most importantly this film is both so intimate yet grande in regards to the MCU. The entire cast and of course Ryan Coogler should be commended for showcasing the beautiful world of Wakanda.Wakanda Forever!",9,2,17,18 February 2018
Green Book," Green Book (2018)
","God dammit I love Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Any friend of mine knows I RAVE about these two and in Green Book, they take an above average script, a workman like production to a greater height.Viggo Mortensen can do anything. Simple as that. The man is our modern day Robert De Niro but better. Tony easily could've been unlikable, but Mortensen exudes charm without sparing complexities. His Tony still says wrong and insensitive things but with Mortensen's nuance the audience are able to understand where this comes from. Another staggeringly warming performance to add to Mortensen's impressive resume.Mahershala Ali, I said to everyone after seeing Moonlight he would be the next big thing and my god is he a talent. Subtle, refined and vulnerable. Ali contrasts his mighty stature with an incredible vulnerability that gives Doc Shirley all the layers that in a lesser actor's hands would be one note. Mahershala Ali never fails to impress, at times showing his comedic chops but then his deep isolation only seen through his expressive eyes.Linda Cardellini also provides solid support to a script that doesn't really do her any favours. The minor gripes I had with the film was the workman like effort of the cinematography and editing. Simple two way shots and cuts but this was all pushed aside for Mortensen's and Ali's magnetic performances.The story was interesting and one hopes that it was true and without any addition of false events as some scenes were genuinely funny and it would be even funnier to know that they happened in reality.Whilst the script in my opinion wasn't worthy of an Academy Award Nomination (mainly due to worthier competition), there are some incredibly subtle references and notions that were fun to pick out whilst the more overt references were also enjoyable.The film is infectiously funny, heartwarmingly touching and I completely recommend the picture to go and have a great laugh and an enjoyable time. I usually go to watch more serious and depressing stories at the cinema but it was a lovely change to come out of the cinema with a great big beaming smile on my face, which was in no small part to Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.",8,0,0,24 January 2019
