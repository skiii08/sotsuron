The Blair Witch Project," radio gives you the best picture
","What people told me about BWP (before I went to see it) fell into four categories, namely:- (i) [competitive chili eater type] 'I wasn't scared in the slightest'(ii) [sensitive/never seen a horror film] 'I was REALLY scared'(iii) [postmodern] 'less is more, pass the homous.....'; or . . . . . .  (iv)  [jaded] 'it didn't live up to all the hype'I got the hype first from advance news of how it was going down in the states and then as the publicity machine clicked into effect on this side of the pond.  I bet this spoilt the fun for a lot of the UK audience, as we had probably heard the entire plot several times before the thing got in front of our eyeballs.I couldn't work out what to think about BWP when I came out of the cinema. But by random TV scheduling I saw 'Sleepers' the following day, a highish budget 'quality' Hollywood film dealing with serious issues (child abuse, revenge killing etc) and with the likes of De Niro and D.Hoffman in it.  It dawned on me then that the experience of watching BWP was hardly linked at all with that of going to see a production like 'Sleepers' or anything else released for mass markets.  BWP is basically a home video.  It almost delights in using the cheapest backdrop and plots ( - a wood - a killer! - Troma's favorites!!) and no SFX worth mentioning. The fact is that BWP would certainly be worse or even pointless if these factors weren't present.  The whole thing is about believability, and for that reason the film must be in the roughcut shape it is in or it couldn't be mistaken for a home video, which is the intention.  Shame then that the thing still cost the same to watch as a proper film, which is about $14US here in London.Secondly, BWP (like 'Sleepers', incidentally) largely left the serious violence as intimated rather than explicit. Hitchcock laughed off complaints about 'Psycho' being too violent/scary when it came out by saying that the film as it progressed got less and less explicit and towards the end he was showing practically nothing on screen, but that the audience found that the most frightening.  With BWP, Hitchcock's point is extrapolated to the point where nigh-on nothing is shown at all.  For me, either the film or my imagination was not quite up to it, and I was not convinced. But it's a pretty good attempt.Maybe it will be better on TV as there's nothing much about the cinema format which adds to the chill factor in this one, except being in a big dark room. In fact, watching pixels on a cinema screen is quite distracting for me. I think a dark night at home with this could prove that the home video format is the proper environment for it to work properly.",Null,0,1,10 November 1999
Dead Poets Society," spot the similarity
","Robin Williams plays a man who arrives as a newcomer into a staid, conservative environment and finds that his unorthodox approach leads to conflicts with his superiors.  Robin Williams gets to show that he has a lively personality and yet deep down be vulnerable and sensitive.Is that an accurate summary of Dead Poet's Society? No, it's an accurate summary of Good Morning Vietnam, Patch Adams AND Dead Poets Society.  All you have to do is change the costume from soldier to doctor to teacher. Wait a minute, there's Awakenings too (doctor again)!I generally like Peter Weir's stuff, and I have no particular animosity for Mr Williams.  But I cannot fathom why people think this is a life-changing film in the slightest.  What is set up is a situation where the audience has no choice but to side with Williams in his battle because the alternative (ie 'the School') is so proposterous.  Take for example the 'rip it out' incident near the start.  No English Literature book would have that kind of an introduction, so when Robin starts going on about the true meaning of poetry appreciation etc., it comes out sounding amazing; but in fact what he is saying is pretty mundane and only unorthodox when compared to the gothic horror of the School's teaching methods.As for the ending, most unlikely and frankly it even trivialises what is a serious subject.Seize the day - go do something else but don't bother with this!!",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
Meet Joe Black," go meet someone else
","Oh dear, nightmare.Personifications of death crop up quite a lot in cinema, but in my view seldom with so little effect as here.  I join with everyone else in being delighted by the 'coffee shop' scene at the start.  But after that, we have a slothful grind through some suspect acting and a plot (and sub-plots) which defy belief even in the context of a film based on death taking a holiday in the US. Clare Forlani is of course not offensive to the eye, but I did worry about her repertoire of acting techniques.  To cheer you up during your nye-on 3 hour sitdown, I suggest you count the number of times she stares at Pitt or Hopkins as they talk, then looks away to stare into the middle distance, gulps and nods rapidly a couple of times.  Presumably that was doing 'sensitive and vulnerable', but after a few repeats I didn't really care.Pitt, well, less said the better about his attempts for much of the film at imitating the lobotomised bloke in 'Planet of the Apes'.  And Hopkins does what he can, but is stuffed by having to play the straight man in a comedy double act with robot-boy.I was fed this as an in-flight movie after I had seen it once in the cinema, it's an hour shorter, a mercy in itself, but the scenes which are cut leaves it even more confused.  Almost everything about Hopkins' business activities goes out the window, along with the best (only) one-liner in the film.The film may be good for people who have missed the difference between sentimentality and romance and I would recommend it to them.  But for me, this film was dead on arrival.  Inquest verdict: misadventure.",5,0,1,4 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," spooked me out
","After all the anticlimactic hype about Blair Witch, here's a top-drawer exercise in film making which I find very hard to fault.  In fact, the only thing which upset my enjoyment was the person sitting next to me in the cinema, who on several occasions screamed very loudly.Anyway, putting my neighbour's reaction down as both a critical 'thumbs up' on her part and a new form of personal surround-sound for me, there is little more to say than to recommend it.  Great plot, well filmed, apposite music, solid acting - enthralling and a genuinely spooky 'chiller' to boot. And where did they get the child actor from? amazing stuff from him - I just hope he recovers from the experience!",Null,0,0,21 December 1999
