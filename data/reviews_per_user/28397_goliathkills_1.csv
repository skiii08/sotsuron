The Longest Yard," It was hard to sit through
","What a waste of time and money. I went into the movie open minded, and having never seen the original. My 11 year old brother-in-law really wanted to see it, so I treated. He loved the comedy, which is more physical and immature in nature. I was amazed that people in the theater were laughing at this crap. The screenplay was one of the driest I've seen in a while, and the acting was pretty average for this type of movie.Unfortunately it seems as though movies of this quality are accepted, and the witty slapstick comedies (Dumb and Dumber, The Naked Gun, and even Jay and Silent Bob) are too few and far between.My brother-in-law liked it so I gave it a star for that.",2,0,2,3 July 2005
