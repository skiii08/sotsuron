Walk the Line," Easily 1 of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE....
","This movie is great on two fronts: 1.) Cinematically, story-wise, it's just about as perfect a movie as you can get. Honestly, it's easily one of my favorite films ever, and for a reason.2.) I can't stress this enough man, PHOENIX AND WITHERSPOON sang the lyrics themselves. Every song you hear in the movie is their voices.Ebert said himself he was gobsmacked when he realized that fact afterwards. Even Jamie Foxx didn't sing any lyrics for his supposed Oscar-worthy performance.That Joaquin didn't EASILY win the Oscar for his performance is one of the greatest crimes of all time. The guy was STRAIGHT UP AMAZING in a once-in-a-lifetime role.Personally I thought the ending was succinct and very well done, too many movies try to draw something out and perhaps the way they ended the movie keeps you wanting more than drawing it out too long.However, I think tiny additions like a quick nod from and to his father at the end would've shown some smidgen of respect finally between the two, as Cash becomes the real family man that his dad never could be...And of course perhaps an even longer stare between he and his wife June could've solidified this movie, as perhaps, THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. No I'm not crazy and I kid you not.As is, for me, objectively speaking, when you consider the performances and the storyline itself, it's a top 10 movie of all time EASILY, and the fact that it has such a low score on here is ridiculous...",Null,0,1,22 August 2011
