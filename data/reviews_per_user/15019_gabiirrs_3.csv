It," We all float down here. Yes, we do!
","I enjoyed every bit of this movie. Although I haven't read the book I think the movie explores a different angle that the one we saw in the miniseries released in the 90's. It renovates the story by exploiting the fears that each kid has, giving a little more strength to their characters individually. The CGI at some point might seem like a little too much but it helps to create the ambiance and drives the story right where it needs to go.The best part of this movie, by far, is the performance of everyone involved. The kids play their part beautifully, but Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd is the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me; he reinvents Pennywise in a very darker and violent way. SkarsgÃ¥rd does not try to fill Tim Curry's shoes, cause that'd be practically impossible, he goes in a different direction creating something new, assuming the role of Pennywise as his own and not some role he has to surpass, which he achieves amazingly.It's not the typical horror movie and this exact reason is why, at least in my opinion, it's refreshing and scary in a unique way. Hands down one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years.They intended to make something different, a movie that had its own essence and not just a plain imitation, and they succeeded wonderfully.",10,5,10,14 September 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," 'How did this happen?' Superheroes become a joke...
","RagnarÃ¶k is the ultimate Nordic battle and the last movie we will see before Infinity War, therefore I was expecting something a little bit more apocalyptic.From the first scene to the very last one everything is a joke, I know MCU likes to make the movies a little kid-friendly with a comic relief, but Thor Ragnarok is way over the top. The movie is full with sad moments, a bunch of them, I couldn't take any of them seriously because the jokes would not stop. Because everything is a joke there's no tension at any point, the main character doesn't grow or learns anything new, and the villain is never something you actually worry about, the plot becomes flat and boring. Hela, played by the amazing Cate Blanchett, is a waste of character, she does it beautifully, as far as she can, but doesn't make a villain you will remember. The friendship between Thor and Hulk doesn't go to a really deep level; and the brotherly Thor-Loki relationship is so predictable that it just plain dull.What I'm most worried about is that this will set a new trend for the new Marvel movies, where superheroes can't be taken seriously because they make a joke out of it. Most heroes have a dark past that makes them who they are, MCU had done an incredibly work till this year, with Spiderman-Homecoming, but specially Thor Ragnarok, a movie that had such a potential but it turned out being a joke, literally. Apparently Marvel is more concerned about making a movie that will make you chuckle for a couple of hours instead of making a movie with a deep story that'll make you say 'I can't wait for the next Marvel movie!'.Now we just have to wait and hope the best for Infinity War.",3,19,36,3 November 2017
Coco," Beautifully done!
","I was very skeptical at first, as a Mexican I was afraid they'll use the stereotypes and put us in a box, but by the end of the movie I felt more Mexican than ever. Coco exploits one of the most important Mexican traditions in a very respectful way, it shows what Día de Muertos it's all about, the one night a year where we can reunite with our beloved ones that are no longer here. Pixar-Disney jumps out of the box, once again, and leave all the princess and fairy stories to show us the importance of family and traditions in a unique funny and colorful story. All the characters are right on point, they grow together learning from each other making it one of the most emotional and pleasing movie I've seen in a long time. A movie that will make you laugh and cry, Coco might be a movie for children but a guarantee everyone will just love it. Bravo!",10,13,41,3 November 2017
