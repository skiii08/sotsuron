Black Swan," I'm sorry I said 'Sigh, Not another movie about Black Swan!!'
","Thank you Darren Aronofsky on this beautiful masterpiece, one of the best movies I've ever seen and I mean EVER. Beats every movie dealing with the evil/good persona except for the Dark Knight and Fight Club. The way it's directed it captures the essence of Black Swan's mood. It's dark, grim, and grey; you don't only see the Black Swan YOU FEEL THE BLACK SWAN, YOU SMELL IT the way it was intended, I even doubt the original story was as good as this even in the mind of the writer. Absolutely transcends imagination in so many creative ways I can't explain. The usage of colours is absolutely fantastic it's a mixture between contrasts either excessive white on excessive black to embody the struggle between good and evil with grey atmosphere and backgrounds denoting the tendency towards the black swan, or another colour I'd like to call Evil Red in Natalie's eyes which Darren surprisingly mastered. The camera is so natural; you come to a certain scenes where you don't notice the camera switching or the editing I'm not familiar with the technical terms. Vincent Cassel was outstanding in most scenes specially when seducing; you can even say, 'He was at his best'. Natalie Portman was great yet still she could've been better, yet Mila Kunis in my opinion didn't do a good job compared to the monsters she was acting with, she still has a lot of work to do. Also sends a good message to overprotecting parents to back off a little.Absolutely 9/10",8,1,2,13 March 2011
Source Code," I don't believe I chose this movie over The Lincoln Lawyer
","I don't believe I spent 2 hours watching this movie, this is not a good story, acting, neither direction, and I can't believe I spent another 20 minutes writing a review on how bad it was, as a matter of fact, I wrote like 3 reviews but they didn't seem decent enough to describe how bad this movie. I highly un-recommend this movie to anyone I like and I highly recommend that you recommend this movie to someone you hate, like an Ex who stripped you down to the ground. And by the way I know this is not a good review because this movie doesn't deserve a well- thought review plus it sucked all the inspiration units out of me for today.Over & Out",4,0,1,13 July 2011
The Beach," Couldn't find the 2 hours away-from-reality I was looking for!!
","If it wasn't for the nice scenery which was completely ruined by the non-existence of BlueRay edition, the movie would've been a complete trash, DiCaprio in this movie isn't only a bad actor but he achieved a new level of 'Sucking' with his Rambo ill-imitation. The plot is yet too simple and you can see the end of the movie from the first five minutes, Adventure & Mystery (which is the movie lacked) is a package deal for the fans of this genre, adventure alone isn't enough. In fact my expectation were high at the beginning when I saw Robert Carlyle, based on his performance in 28 Days Later, he represents Mystery. No unexpected twist or a high climax or anything. If I wasn't trying to reach a certain number in my 'Watch List', I would've turned off my laptop in the first five minutes, took out the DVD smash it repeatedly with the butt of my Philips screwdriver, then trash it and spit on it a couple of times. I guess Boyle wasn't as good as he's today.Over & Out",5,0,1,21 July 2011
