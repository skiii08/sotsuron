Angels & Demons," Religious (Anti)matters
","While I like Tom Hanks, I'm not a big fan of religious machinations, so I watched this with some skepticism. I was quickly turned around.This taut thriller directed by Ron Howard keeps you on your toes as a Harvard historian (Robert Langdon played by Hanks) is called in by the Vatican police to find who deployed a bomb using antimatter stolen from CERN that will destroy central Rome in 24 hours.Langdon teams up with the CERN scientist who created the antimatter, and together they slowly catch up with the hired hand who is killing papal candidates (the pope appears to have died, but was actually murdered). Plenty of potential evildoers are highlighted, from shadowy Illuminati who leave too many clues, to a cardinal who seems to eager to become the next pope, to the deceased pope's personal servant, to the chief of the Swiss guard sworn to protect the pope.In the end, the day is saved and a new pope is elected, but not before an antimatter blast lights up the skies above Rome at the proverbial midnight hour. This is one of the many forgivable gaffes in the film, as a 1 gram antimatter explosion even high in the sky would have blasted Rome anyway. There's a reason 5 kiloton nuclear weapons are detonated well above ground as they drop, to maximize blast damage. At least the film, unlike the book, shows some damage being done. There are other little weaknesses in the plot (an experienced assassin who gets in a getaway car supplied by his contractor without worrying about said contractor wanting to erase all traces of the crime?!). Nothing that requires enough suspension of disbelief to ruin the plot, though. As always, view the film on its own merits rather than worrying about the book, which of course has more motivation, more detail, more character development.It's a (antimatter) blast, and even after the denouement (which was not easy to guess ahead of time because there were, as I said, plenty of bad-guy-candidates), one could see the film again for all the loving little details.",7,0,0,19 August 2019
Vertigo," Hitchcock in top form
","Jimmy Stewart plays Scottie Ferguson, a police detective who cannot abide heights. An old school acquaintance exploits Stewart's weakness to make his wife's murder look like a suicide. These are perfect ingredients for a mystery-thriller. The film seems to reach an ending of sorts when the crime is committed. Stewart is sent to a sanatorium because of his double guilt: falling in love with the beautiful Madeleine (Kim Novak), another man's wife; and not being able to rescue her when she climbs a high tower to jump to her death. He just can't get (it) up to follow her to the apex - classic Hitchcock sexual imagery. Adultery coupled with inability to consummate is a miserable combination.Just when you think it's all over, the film really gets going. As is often the case in Hitchcock's thrillers, the real fun is not in the crime, but in unraveling the mastermind's evil plot. Think about 'Dial M for Murder,' or 'Rear Window,' another Stewart vehicle.While detective Scottie Ferguson strolls along the streets of San Francisco, having recovered from the sanatorium, he sees - Madeleine!She turns out just to be a sales girl who resembles his dead flame. Or is that all? As Ferguson slowly remakes the sales girl in the image of Madeleine, the resemblance is just too uncanny. Finally a small mistake gives her away. It becomes clear that this girl IS Ferguson's Madeleine whom he loved, and that his school friend's real wife was the one dropped from the tower on that fateful day. When Ferguson insists on revisiting the crime scene, he inadvertently drives the impersonator who has come to love him to her real death atop the very same tower.Hitchcock leaves it open whether the impostor's death finally frees Ferguson not just from his guilt complex, but also from his inability to have an intimate relationship. He certainly was no longer in love with the impostor when he realized the truth. And his patient girlfriend Midge, who nursed him through the sanatorium for months (played by Barbara Bel Geddes to great effect) is still there, waiting...Midge is really the only good person in this morality play, really better than what Ferguson deserves. This is the reason Hitchcock cast the more ambiguous, sometimes whiny Stewart in the role, as opposed to a Cooper, Peck, or Grant. Hitchock plays all the drama to the max, assisted by the usual excellent Hermann score. The Edith Head costumes play a pivotal role in distinguishing the Madeleine-sales girl identities. Even the rear projection is fun to watch, as one can divine when Hitchcock thought a scene important enough to leave the safety of the studio. A 9/10 from the era when people still took Freud seriously, and suspenseful fun to watch even in the era when Freud is exposed as, well, let's just say someone who selectively analyzed his data. Just like Scottie Ferguson in this film.",9,6,7,5 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than nothing
","After years of waiting, I enjoyed Episode I as much as I could. Lucas would have been better off bringing in a really good script writer to tighten the script, and a stellar sf director to direct. His forte was always in the vision and special effects, and in his first Star Wars film (Episode IV), he condensed all his best material, so it was not as much of a problem with him directing; but when you work with the leftovers, a more deft hand is needed at the reins.The battle robots in this movie are unbelievably inept, and the idea that they instantly shut down when a ship in orbit is destroyed, instead of having some basic battle autonomy, seems silly. In fights with Obi Wan or Qui-Gon, they are cannon fodder mowed down like grass. Their interactivity with the actors is not at par with a classic like Harryhausen's 'Argonauts.' Sure, the old stop motion animation is a bit rickety, but those skeletons at least put up a fight!I thought Vader as a boy was cast OK, but needed to be more brooding; Hitler and Stalin also thought they would bring order to the Gala... uh, Europe and Russia, but they were not happy-go-lucky little children, and Vader needed more complex feeling than some vague 'fear' detected by Yoda. Still, one could imagine the boy growing up into a morose, powerfully built poor farm kid, which is more than one can say of Hayden Christiansen in part II. There was a reason that body builder David Prowse played Vader's form in the original, instead of a gangly, scrawny youth.The movie coalesces once the motley crew reaches Tattooine, hiding the queen of Naboo from the trade federation controlled by the Sith Master, her own planet's senator. A drag race modeled after the final X-wing attack in the original (Epsisode IV) ensues, and Obi Wan, now with queen Amidala and young Anakin Skywalker in tow, escapes to a futile mission to get Naboo's side heard in the galactic senate. In the end, Naboo wins over the trade federation because a soon-to-be Jedi strong with the Force blows up the gigantic space station with a small fighter, and a great big party follows. If this all sounds too familiar to viewers of Episode IV, it is! The score by Williams is great, more use should have been made of the Sith apprentice Darth Maul, one of the few innovations in this film, and the acting and special effects (other than the droids) are good. It's a professional but not innovative remake that traces an older Skywalker's fall from grace, as opposed to his son's rise to grace.",6,0,3,27 February 2014
The Equalizer," Ultraviolent and yet thoughtful
","In this film, Denzel Washington as a former agent-turned-Home Depot associate 'Bob' is confronted with the question: Must he act against injustices instead of just standing by, given his past training as assassin, given who he is? He befriends a hooker, who thinks he is rather a 'Robert' than a 'Bob,' and she is right of course. They always chat at the same diner, where he sits at a meticulously arranged table reading is latest book, such as 'Old Man and the Sea.' When she, a singer at heart, is brutally mutilated by her pimp, something snaps and Robert starts offering the bad guys an option: behave, or die. None of them take him seriously until they are dying. This attracts the attention of the highest echelon of Russian crimelords: they can't figure out who is messing with their US operations.The movie starts out very quietly introducing Washington's character as a man of precision, reader of a good novel every night, and helper in his community. Then it turns hyperviolent to set the tone of Robert as a clockwork killer. He assesses each situation, estimates time to mission completion, sets his stopwatch and... proceeds to cut out eyes with broken glass rims, drill though necks, strangle people with barbed wire, and so forth. Then he washes up and goes back to work.Once the film has established his extreme capabilities, it dials the mayhem way back to focus on a cat-and-mouse game between Robert and the Russian emissary who comes after him. By the time Robert blows up the crimelord's shipyard and neutralizes their money laundering operation, we are willing to believe that he could do it, never mind the details. Plot holes are avoided, such as when Robert gets permission from his former Agency bosses to clean up the Russians.The climax in Robert's store is well played. As the emissary dies, one can tell that this is an incredible situation for him: how could he, who dispatches people like lint, suddenly be the lint? Unfortunately, the film then commits the sin of Hollywood action flicks incapable of quitting while ahead of the game. When Robert has walked off into the night, the film needed a quiet shot of the unoccupied diner table, open to page three of a newspaper announcing a Russian mafia lord in Moscow has been assassinated, then panning over to the latest reading material 'Invisible Man.' Instead, we get an unnecessary scene of electrocution of said mafia lord in Moscow, and Robert happily ever after meeting up with his friends, as though he could (Agency permission or not) despite all the FBI and police have learned. All to loud rock music that does not fit the tone of a man quietly equalizing the world for the weak. And then Robert gets his first text message to 'save someone' on his iPad, the call for the sequel.Could have been 8 stars without the botched ending, but a good film even so.",7,0,2,23 February 2015
Iron Man 3," Not bad for a third installment
","Superhero movies go through a cycle: In the first, we learn about the formation of the hero; this one is usually my favorite (Darkman or Unbreakable come to mind, both better films because they knew to 'stop when you're on top'). The second installment usually descends into mindless action, with no character development to speak of. Then in the third, the hero is beginning to have self-doubts, making it more interesting again.Iron Man 3 is no exception to this loose rule, better than 2, not as good as 1. It pits our cynical and flippant hero against a cynical and flippant evil mastermind, who uses an Osama-bin-laden look-alike actor as his face to the world to rev up business for human fighting machines he has created.The film is filled with plot holes (for example, an Iron Man costume with unidentified occupant is allowed onto Air Force One without a check, hello), and physically impossible action (Iron Man catches a dozen people falling from a plane, and the two hanging on from him, from whose hands hang six more each, don't lose their grip under a > 1000 pound force as Iron Man brakes just before they hit the ground). The surrealism is about at the level of another fairly successful action movie from summer '13, Olympus is Down. In neither movie does it matter, it's about the action. In both films the main actor manages enough charisma to move things along despite glaring script inadequacies.Iron Man 3 is surprisingly introspective, with plenty of action but also quieter passages between Tony and Pepper, Tony and a kid who helps him out, Tony dealing with anxiety attacks from his Avenger stint, even Tony and the Osama-bin-laden stand-in. It gets a plus for that. It gets a minus for being so self-conscious about its one-liners that it has to comment on them! Might as well face it: nobody beats Bond or Arnold at that game.The movie is certainly worth the while for Marvel fans, and everyone else, see #1, skip #2 and go straight to #3. You'll be better entertained that way.",6,0,1,25 December 2013
Minority Report," A merely good Dick adaptation
","I think the critics went a little overboard loving this one. It is good - with Spielberg at the helm that's almost a certainty, but it is not outstanding. Chief of its crimes is happy ending syndrome. Max von Sydow is really the best character in the film by far, so why not let him get away with his well-meaning but tragic master plan for humanity? Dystopia does not need a happy ending. But far worse, do we really need to find out that the abused human crime sensors, who have spent a life immersed in an isolation tank, get to live happily ever after in a cozy cottage? In AI, a whole half hour finale separated the film from Kubrickian quality. Here it's only 10 minutes, but entropy being what it is, 10 minutes of garbage can destroy 2 hours of vision quite easily.And what a vision it is. Cruise as a detective bereft of his son, himself a son-figure to the fatherly von Sydow who developed a crime prediction program that arrests murderers before they get a chance to carry out their crime. When Cruise is on the verge of discovering how his mentor pulled off a premeditated murder to save the program, Von Sydow uses Cruise's dead son against him, and the detective becomes a hunted man. Crime mystery, action and science fiction are deftly blended in the plot, in the set design, and even in minor characters like the woman geneticist who surrounds herself with flesh-eating plants, or the eye transplant doctor who had a previous encounter with Cruise: Cruise comes begging to him to avoid detection by the ubiquitous eye scanners of the future. Silly action like Cruise escaping 10x by a hair trapped inside a car assembled by industrial robots does not help the film, pulling you out of the sense of futuristic reality created by the cinematography.So, good, but not great. When Spielberg makes Ubiq, I hope he just sticks with Dick's story, without the alternate ending. Philip K. Dick is already 'alternate' enough as it is.",6,2,2,11 February 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Satire, light comedy, dark comedy, slapstick ... you name it!
","I love British humor, and Monty Python in particular. I can take 10 episodes of 'Are you being served' in a row. Even MP's lesser works, like 'Holy Grail' still tickle my fancy. So take that 8/10 with the corresponding grain of salt.Treating the life and times of Christ with a touch of comedy is not an easy task. MP came up with the perfect solution by chronicling instead the inglourious basterd born next door, Brian. Brian's life in many ways parallel's Jesus - and in some others, not.MP is known for short sketches, and really this movie is just a concatenation of brilliant sketches, but so well fused together, that it stands as a full-length feature comedy chronicling the life of a mistaken prophet on his way to crucifixion. It is populated by the most funny characters, like a lisping Pontius Pilate, who revels in telling his soldiers about his friend 'Biggus Dickus' and his wife 'Incontinentia Buttox,' throwing them to the lions if they dare laugh. In this inimitable scene, as in many others, it is not the relative lame joke that brings down the house, but the way it is relentlessly built up even more, just when you think it's had its 15 seconds of fame. Sometimes more is ...more!The film is a not-so-hidden diatribe against religious zealotry, feeble politicians, and that most dangerous thing, mass opinion, which is all too easily manipulated as Alex de Tocqueville has taught us.The sets are surprisingly good for such a comedy production, as many were left over from another biblical film and reused. This works extremely well in the film's favor, as it juxtaposes the slyness and buffoonery of its characters against a very believable backdrop. And who can complain about some Mozart sacral music in the background?Definitely one of the best comedies ever filmed, almost in a league with 'Dr. Strangelove,' which is high praise from me because I am an even bigger Kubrick fan than MP fan.",8,0,1,4 November 2015
Star Trek," End of an era
","In 'The Omega Glory,' a Star Trek episode from the 1960s, the words of the US Constitution are repeated over generations, until they become mere sounds babbled by Yank(ees) and Com(munists) who no longer understand their meaning, nor why they are fighting one another.This pretty much describes the handing down of Star Trek from Roddenberry to Braga/Berman and finally to Jeffrey Abrams. Abrams is a journeyman action director, not a visionary auteur like Roddenberry, and in his hands Star Trek is just CGI babble.The plot of the film falls apart within minutes - usually it takes time travel stories at least one or two acts, or in the case of the original series episode 'Tomorrow is Yesterday,' a perfect loop even restores consistency. If a Vulcan tried to save my Romulan home planet with 'red matter' and failed, but we were both thrown 100 years back in the process, we'd just try again, succeed, end of film, even in the 'new time line.' We have 100 years to fix the problem in whatever time line. I certainly would not use the precious red matter to implode my near-savior's home planet Vulcan. The Romulan is psychotic, you say? I don't think a logical and highly organized warrior race would let psychotics fly its expensive space craft. End of film.It's a pity because the new cast is pretty good. I would have hired Gary Sinise as McCoy, but Urban is nice. Quinto is a good Spock, but let's leave out the romance with Uhura, shall we? It became even clearer with 'Into Darkness' that Jeffrey Adams just does not get Star Trek as a cultural icon, and so Roddenberry's vision must linger for now, enfeebled into CGI action nonsense with puerile plots, while we wait for someone who understands the Great Bird's positive and sophisticated vision for humanity's future. In an episode of Voyager, the first officer catches a woman recently freed from a cyborg collective playing a piece from Robert Schumann's Kinderszenen on the piano, with a metronome. He asks her to abandon the security of the metronome and play the piece again as a human. That is Star Trek. This is not.",4,5,7,11 February 2014
The Maze Runner," 'Lord of the Flies,' meet 'Cube'
","This is a pretty strong entry in the youth action genre (think 'Hunger Games'), but the scriptwriters mess it up a bit at the end with unnecessary clichés. Like the much better mother of them all, the 1963 version of 'The Lord of the Flies,' the film presents us with boys building their own makeshift society on an island, this island being contained in a gigantic maze. Like the much better 'Cube,' the maze shifts around and is filled with deadly things.None of the young adults have any idea of how they got there, but the two most recent arrivals, a curious boy and a GIRL are stirring up a mess. The new arrival Thomas (they appear mysteriously every month through an elevator shaft) almost gets himself and the others killed by making forays into the maze that are forbidden by the law of this makeshift society.Eventually it becomes clear - big surprise! - that they are all just an experiment to train youth immune to a deadly virus to survive in the post-apocalyptic outside world, which supposedly will make the monsters in the maze look harmless.The ensemble cast does a good job at acting their way through a surprisingly linear plot, considering it takes place in a labyrinth. Our hero has as his foil a leader who wants to keep the status quo. The semi-mechanical monsters that stalk them are well executed. The maze may remind many of us of 'labyrinth nightmares' we had as kids. The final explanation is a bit hokey, and features one of the most blatant setups for a sequel you are likely to see anytime soon. But then, perhaps the girl in this movie will serve a purpose in the sequel, other than just a girl being in the movie?I was ready to vote 7 at the beginning of the third act, but then they have the boys' leader, who blames hero Thomas for all the evils of the maze, show up out of nowhere at the end, the typical all-too-expected-unexpected-evil-guy. It really is an unexpected plot hole, as the maze shut itself dramatically after our heroes escaped, and there really is no explanation of how Mr. Leader rejoins the escapees. He does gratuitously kill the 'fat boy' (a standard stereotype character in such movies) before they all get rescued and it is revealed that the true evil mastermind (perhaps she tortures our heroes out of necessity) is guiding them towards the sequel.So a 6 it is; worth a watch, but not a flick to come back to over and over again once its meager secrets have been revealed. It is however well enough acted, art-directed, directed, and scripted (save for that silly ending), that I'll probably check out the sequel. Kind of like the Star Wars prequels: not great, but good enough to make you curious what they are going to come up with next time. In the meantime, go see the 1963 'Lord of the Flies' if you want to see a good film about savage makeshift youth societies, or 'Cube' if you want to see a good film about a relentless labyrinth out to get you.",6,0,0,20 February 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Easily beats Episodes 1 and 3.
","Rogue One has many good things in it, and also some important flaws. Still, overall it is a good film.The story explains how the Death Star could have been built with a design flaw that would allow a single torpedo fired by Luke Skywalker to bring it down: its chief engineer Galen Erso hated the Empire, and made sure the rebels would catch wind of the design error he planted. The story revolves around an ensemble cast led by Galen's daughter Jyn Erso, first tracking down Erso, then finding out where the plans are stored, and finally retrieving them to get them into Princess Leia's hands. The movie gets my kudos for explaining this all in a pretty reasonable way.Some of the stretches in the story line are not all that bad. For example, the idea that a sophisticated data library would require mechanical retrieval of data may seem a bit silly. But then, we all know that voting machines are decoupled from the internet for good reason, and if you really want to store secrets, you will do it in a way that requires mechanical retrieval and other layers to insulate it from remote data theft.The appearance of well-known characters like Grand Moff Tarkin and Princes Leia Organa is also welcome, and was pulled off quite well . Some viewers find this creepy (the real actors who first played these characters in 1977 are deceased), and thus imagine all kinds of bad CGI or acting, when in fact these were nicely done. It's one of those cases where, if you know something is fake, your mind is going to come up with reasons why it is fake, even if it looks almost perfect. In fact, if you showed Tarkin and Leia from Rogue One to a person who's never heard of Star Wars, they would perfectly well accept them as somewhat heavily makeup-covered actors from a science fiction movie. I'd say their acting was better than that of many longer roles in this film! I commend the director and special effects people for daring to do it, even if it's only 95% perfect.The final 'Battle of Dubai' is nicely done, with mayhem contrasted with idyllic gardens and blue skies, a welcome change from the usual deep space battle that is de rigeur in Star Wars films. It kills off the ensemble cast after their mission is completed, and Disney is to be commended for making a film where not everyone lives happily ever after.The female heroine is just there. She's not played up in any way, and it's a true sign of emancipation when you don't think 'Oh look, they put in a female heroine to be politically correct.' Perhaps this is why the actress was instructed to play a bit bland and 'just be there.' It works, but of course, it also doesn't work.But there are also many problems. The 'fan service' is a little too heavy-handed, and sometimes disturbs the flow of the story. Why do we need to see R2-D2 and C-3PO for 3 seconds? Why does a rough character from a bar on Mos Eisley from the original 1977 movie have to walk down a city street on a different world? The list goes on.A major corollary of this problem is that the film spends too much time rushing to multiple locations, showing nuggets from the original, and rushing the ensemble cast along, denying its characters the time needed to become well-developed and thus likable. I honestly could not remember the names of many of the ensemble cast of rogues who steal the plans, and still did not know when they died. I would say at a minimum, you need to introduce your characters well enough that I know their first name when they die! The rush prevents the actors from building up their characters properly, so there's not much of a lump of sorrow in the viewer's throat when they give their lives. The film was not quite sure whether to spend some time (like the original), or rev up the pace (like I, II and III) for the generation of viewers with short attention span. In the end it did neither, boring those with little attention span, and puzzling those who wanted to understand what the characters are about. Basically, this film either needed to be cut by a half hour, or lengthened by a half hour, but the in-between approach does not quite do the story line and characters full justice.Finally, the dialogue is sometimes cringe-worthy, in particular the great declamations. To be fair though: Jyn Erso's speech at the rebel headquarters was awful, BUT they did turn her request down! So what do you want? She's totally inexperienced as a leader, gives a bad speech, they say 'sorry, we can't.' It's actually quite realistic and moves the story into act III. The android made up for it by having some dry English humor quips just at the right times in the film.To make up for any flaws, there are many beautiful locations, grand battles, the overall concept is sound, and the intentions are good, so I'll give this film a 7. I'd see it again at some point, if for no other reason than to discover the more subtle fan service that I surely missed, so I can bemoan some more how Disney overdid it. For people who played the Star Wars video games and got a completely different story of how the Death Star plans were captured, it must be quite jarring, and I doubt many of them would go above a 5/10. However, they can take solace in the fact that even real history is never self-consistent because alternative views of events persist, and the winner who writes history one day may be the loser another day and have it rewritten over their grave.",7,3,9,24 December 2016
World War Z," Where's the zany gore?
","Hero gets chased; hero flies to new location; hero gets chased; hero flies to new location; hero gets chased; hero flies to new location and gets chased; hero has airplane titanium part stuck in his gut, but after extraction, fights on like a good camper; hero gets sick; zombies avoid the sick.So much for the monotone plot and implausible ending. Of course, most zombie movies don't have a much more sophisticated plot, but they don't have the following problems: lack of zany gore, and pseudo mumbo-jumbo pretense of explaining zombies medically!The 'zany' vs. pretentious part: this movie is 'serious' and attempts to elevate zombies to realistic status: it's a disease with an incubation time of 15 seconds, they can chase you at high pace, and lumber around only when dormant because no healthy victim is nearby, they can't be killed by disease because they have no circulating blood, etc. But the premise falls flat with inconsistencies. Too much BS pseudo-science. Like, why would the underlying disease bug prevent the host from biting a deadly sick human: after a 15 second incubation time, your circulation will cease and you'll be 'dead-alive' anyway. No evolutionary advantage here.Speaking of Dead-Alive (also known as Braindead in Australia). Unlike Peter Jackson's masterpiece of zany zombie gore, this movie has no real zombie gore. Brains are bashed in - off-screen; hands are cut off - off-screen; etc - off-screen. Zombie movies are about ridiculous, all-out, gore. Not about pretentious, pseudo-medically-explained off-screen gore for the parentally accompanied pre-teen audience.This film falls flat on all counts. No plot. No zany. No gore. Mucho pretense. It gets a 5 for reasonably professional production values and an OK chase scene here or there. It's mediocre, not awful. Go see 28 Days instead, a better entry in the 'serious' zombie genre that has cropped up of late.",5,0,1,7 February 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Devolution into Darkness
","It is interesting how a concept finally evolves, or devolves, to adapt to changing times. The original Star Trek TV series was built on the premise that humans would solve their problems at home and then explore the universe, that racial equality, lack of need for monetary currencies, and the US and Russians being buddies would be the norm. It also dissected a human mind's emoting-reasoning-deciding process into the open, making each a separate character in the McCoy-Spock-Kirk trio. It was sheer joy to watch Kirk listen to his emotions and to his logic, and then act decisively. Star Trek was ahead of its time (as the best sf is), a cultural spearhead of the mid-60s to 90s.Abrams clearly does not understand any of this, and serves up a particularly mindless action and special effects concoction, in keeping with the times. In previous installments, the Khan antagonist's motivation was conquest of the universe, or revenge against Kirk. Here it seems to be revenge against a secondary character whose motives are revealed in passing towards the end of the film! And the secondary character is a high-up in the Federation, so much for humanity solving its problems and exploring the universe. The talents of Benedict Cumberbatch (think of a film like 'The Imitation Game'!) are sadly wasted here.The movie treads no new ground, everything from aerial car chases, to the buddy-I-can-see-but-not-touch death scene has been done better elsewhere, either in previous installments of the franchise, or in other films.Sadly, the film does not bring Star Trek to a new generation of moviegoers. It brings sf/action du jour, borrowing a few names and the general shape of a starship from Roddenberry's vision, but nothing else, to a new generation of moviegoers.",5,2,5,21 December 2013
The Fifth Element," a scalpel descends on 'la culture américaine'
","On the surface, this is a SF action film about former warriors-turned-taxi-drivers saving damsels in distress for a grand cause. Visually it is based on the famed graphic novels by Moebius and Jodorowsky. The plot is slave to a concatenation of unforgettable scenarios, from an alien blue opera singer shot to death at the height of her aria, to BADA-BOOM.But really, this movie tweaks modern culture, especially the 'culture américaine' with which the French (a species to which Director Luc Besson belongs) have such a love-hate relationship. The movie is full of 1000s (literally) auditory and visual cultural allusions. Some of them are hyped up to hysterical levels, like the annoying talk show host we all would like to kill (played to immense effect by Chris Tucker). Others are slightly more subtle (like cigarettes with filters longer than the tobacco part). Many require careful viewing (like some of the items in the collection of the flying Chinese lunch truck). One of the most loving and thorough set and prop designs I've ever seen in a film.I find that some people instinctively hate this movie. When cornered, they can't put their finger on the plot or acting (although neither is always pristine in this film), for there are many films with cartoon acting and deus ex machina plot devices that are not hated. Instead, I suspect they feel indignation at the fun that is being poked at the cultural memes they have accepted.This film is SF at its best: a satire that uses the distant future to examine our corporate politics, our pop culture, our high art, our food, and yes, our cigarette butts - now.",8,2,4,2 June 2012
Hot Fuzz," Hotly hilarious, leaves a Fuzzy glow
","A friend told me that I would be amused by this film, and I was!It took me about a minute at the beginning to realize that I was going to be in for some deep satire, as the cop played by Simon Pegg works up the ladder of his superiors to find out that he's 'too good to be kept on staff because he makes everyone else look bad.' I had previously seen Pegg only in a Star Trek cameo, where his talents were wasted at the hands of JJ Abrams. Here, he shines.As he is reassigned to a quaint British village, it slowly dawns on him that not all is as it seems, and that mysterious deaths are a grand collusion of the villagers. His sidekick is a naive but eager learner, and the two work off each other really well. The quips are hilarious.The British villager characters are drawn wonderfully, even the little lady with her crossword puzzles is really a demonic killer. The plot proceeds from more of a cop mystery-and-detective story to outrageous action set pieces as we approach the climax.In a way, the structure of this film is a little like Blues Brothers, an equally quirky movie: things start out reasonably normal, but by the end, things are so over-the-top that you're not quite sure where it transited from improbable to impossible.I'll have to go see Shaun of the Dead now, even though the title did not sound very inspiring!",8,2,3,2 January 2017
Spider-Man 3," Forced writing
","Spiderman 3 had two very interesting villains - one who could 'demolecularize' into sand, and the other a snubbed photographer who links up with an alien critter after Spiderman manages to rid himself of it.Sadly, the writing for this film is stilted, to force artificially and rapidly plot points that would otherwise take too long to reach because there are oh-so-many such plot points. The worst case-in-point is the deteriorating relationship between Spidey and MJ. It relies on a hilariously artificial set of misunderstandings, as well as completely un-Peter-Parker-characteristic public displays (e.g. a kiss on the lips of someone other than MJ during a celebration, with the mask purposely pulled up to make it 'wet'). Likewise, the contortions of Harry Osborn as frenemy are beyond plausible, and scientists operating a demolecularization device getting a weird reading are not going to say 'Bah, just a bird, it'll fly away when we turn it on.' As a scientist who operates expensive equipment at taxpayer's cost, I have to say this is plain ridiculous. Of course they would have a closed-circuit camera imaging the area of the experiment!The writers could have streamlined this script while developing the stories of the villains better. All in all, it's either totally implausible (sandman's genesis) or totally annoying (MJ and Peter's deteriorating relationship) as executed. 5/10 because I did not leave as a happy camper, despite to villains with a lot of potential.",5,0,1,15 November 2019
The Terminator," Splendid low budget entertainment
","Gale Anne Hurd and John Cameron really showed how to deliver a whole lot of movie on a shoestring budget. With a budget so tight that 'bandit' re-shooting of scenes was necessary while evading the local sheriff, the producer/director team launched Schwarzenegger into his action career in a way that 'Conan' had not quite been able to do.It was a stroke of genius that Arnold insisted on playing not the hero but the bad robot, sent back from the future to kill the human heroine who might otherwise have a son who would vanquish the machines one day in the future. As a result, 'The Terminator' had to be changed from a crowd-blender concept to the Arnold-size concept that 'will be back' with big mayhem and does not try to hide or blend.Linda Hamilton did an incredible job of morphing from pink-dressed diner waitress to steely woman of action whose progeny must save the world of the future. Schwarzenegger developed great affects, like the scanning eyes, to make his character seem less human. And Biehn was a good hero, although he was in the shadow of his monosyllabic adversary. Some of the special effects have not aged well. Unlike Carpenter in 'The Thing,' Cameron could not afford to eliminate stop-motion sequences from the film entirely. There just was not a budget for large scale puppetry, the only alternative at the time. Many fans would stone me for saying this, but The Terminator is a good candidate for CGI-ing Stan Winston's vision, if it's done right: following the original shots exactly, without fooling around, while making all motions smooth, and rubbery prostheses more realistic. The cigarette smoke that was blown through the crushed exoskeleton in the closing scenes does not need to be redone!The plot occasionally wanders a bit, and Cameron is not quite as good a composer as he might think he is, but this film is a true auteur work at the highest level, hampered to an '8' only by the tiny budget. Hurd and Cameron were a match made in heaven (and for a while, on Earth). Action film fans should be grateful to this duo for all eternity.",8,1,2,30 July 2015
The Adventures of Tintin," A matinée adventure close to Hergé's spirit
","The dynamic duo of Spielberg and Jackson has done a very nice job here, bringing to simulated life the adventures of a young reporter and his always-drunk captain sidekick to find secret plans of treasure in a bottled ship.There is plenty of adventure for young and old unfamiliar with Tintin, and of course a trip to childhood memories for those who know the comic books. There's every reason to hope Jackson will direct a sequel. Hergé took pains to explore very different aspects of comic story-telling in different Tintin books, so every one of these sequels could stand own its own, like the better James Bond movies.Tintin comes off as the same 'Everyman' seen in the books; a character almost anyone can smoothly identify with, and who made the reader feel 'hmmm, maybe I could do that, too.' No superheroes in sight, even though many of the adventures are pretty crazy.The PG rating is spot on, with a few deaths off-screen and some blood, nothing the 8+ crowd cannot handle. As in any good adventure film viewable by children, the heroes Tintin and Haddock never kill anyone (even when it appears so for a moment), although they fight and shoot with abandon. As in any good adventure film viewable by adults, there are some interesting characters and some plot and visual ideas you probably have not seen in any other film before. Snowy (Tintin's trusted dog) in particular gets some of these going. He's his own little 'silent dog movie' built into the greater adventure. If you go to see it twice, just focus on Snowy, and you'll see what I mean.The visuals are extraordinarily well done. Their character matches the comic strip from title sequence to final credits about as well as you could hope to match the inimitable Hergé. Serkis knows motion capture acting. The 3-D was never annoying (well, one gratuitous cane- swing excepted), and I am easily annoyed by 3-D.It gets 'only' a 7/10 because the plot alternates a little too much between almost stalling at times (in the characterization scenes), then taking off too frenetically (in the plentiful and fanciful chase scenes); and because character development could have been a little better (but the comics don't do it in a single book, either...). I left the theater as a very satisfied moviegoer.",7,0,2,22 December 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A double dose of genius
","What do you get when one of the most versatile directors of the 20th century, and one of its most gifted comedians, team up with a great support cast to make a black comedy?You get what arguably is the best black comedy ever made - but certainly one of the best.The plot is straightforward: a plane carrying atomic bombs is accidentally sent to drop 'em over Russia, and its Texan pilot refuses any attempts to be recalled. In the meantime, senior military personnel and the US president debate how to turn this problem to their advantage.It pokes fun at US leadership and its military at the height of the Cold War, and by implication at all things American, while maintaining a certain respect and reverence for its subject. Only a pair of Brits could pull that off. Recently, on a much lesser scale, only Jean Luc Besson with 'The 5th Element' has been able to pull off this kind of satire, from a French perspective.Peter Sellers is near his pinnacle here, which he bested only in 'Being There,' not long before his death. Given Sellers' penchant for improv, and Kubrick's 'by the book, let's do 100 takes of every scene until I'm satisfied' approaches, it must have been interesting on the set. Sellers' inimitable physicality comes out in all three roles, although my favorite is his Wernher Von Braun in-a-wheelchair parody. People of a certain age group only need to see someone clasp one hand with the other while pretending to strangle themselves, and will immediately collapse in laughter at this meme. Warning #1: if you don't like Seller's style of slapstick (i.e. you hate 'The Party' or 'The Pink Panther'), then 'Dr. Strangelove' may be a bit over the top for you. Warning #2: Actor Slim Pickens (his real name) plays Major 'King' Kong in this film. Then the character naming really gets weird!The movie is deep, and too close to the truth, but its finest details have been analyzed plentifully and need not be rehashed here. Suffice it to say that I have seen it four times, yet still discover devilish new details in dialogue, set design and story arc whenever I see it again.A masterpiece of the mid-twentieth century.",10,1,4,24 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A case of déjà-vu - but a nice enough one
","This is the weakest of the original trilogy. Watching it, one gets the feeling that Lucas is mixing recycled material with some things dumped from the original because he had too much material for one film. Now it's not quite enough for three.The Wook... pardon me, Ewoks have shrunk in size for this one. Cuter=more merchandise. We do get to see the forest world of Chewbacca eventually in the prequels. How the Ewoks survive in the wild if they can't even wield a slingshot is beyond me. And while one can have some limited success with arrows and stones against armored troops with laser guns, the battle on Endor is simply comical in the way the stormtroopers practically slaughter themselves in horror at the little bears. The Death Star gets blown up again. It feels like it was the planned original climax, but with more of the story worked out in the second and third film, what to but to just do it again? The set piece in the Canti... pardon me, Jabba's fortress, has the band playing it up again. The Emperor commits the classic 'James Bond villainous mastermind' mistake: let the good guys into your inner sanctum (such as the field generator on Endor) while chatting them up, thus giving them plenty of opportunity to blow your hideaway to pieces. Dr. No couldn't have done it any better. It's OK: the original Star Wars was more comedic (and thus actually better) than the prequels, just like the James Bond films. It is a Space Opera, not a Space Odyssey!I have to give John Williams credit for the music. The re-orchestration of older material is great, and one tune in particular, the Ewoks' Parade, is a nice piece of neoclassical composition that holds its own even on public radio programs. It made the little critters almost sufferable! As an extensive listener to the classic repertoire, I would say Williams did not rip the old-timers like Dvorak off any more than they did each other (Such as Dvorak ripping of the Leitmotif from the Scherzo of Beethoven's 9th). His score has to be one of the best film scores of the 20th century, and I say that despite plenty of stiff competition from Jarre Sr., Herrmann, or sf experts like Goldsmith. I would say in recent memory, only Howard Shore has matched such a variety of good melodies and deft orchestration for the LOTR films.A parting shot regarding the re-mastering almost 20 years later: as always, Lucas could not resist overdoing it when sprucing up 'Return' for re-release. Consider the following little example: in the original, there is an outside shot of the twin suns of Tattooine setting over Jabba's fortress. The shot is quiet, suggesting that everyone is slumbering away, which is exactly what Leia is supposed to think while thawing Han. In the remake, Lucas had to put some desert frog in the foreground of this formerly serene shot, snarfing up a bug and burping loudly. It's as though he has forgotten why he put that scene there in the first place. Oh, George.",7,0,1,18 March 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Solid, but not that great
","'The Winter Soldier' plays the old game of making the former buddy the bad guy, in this case because the Nazi organization that was supposedly defeated in the first film infiltrates the very substance of SHIELD, the organization that should keep such things in check. Predictably, the buddy-turned-evil pawn redeems himself at the end by saving Captain America.On the scale of such action flicks, this film is competently executed, and has some nice set pieces, such as the intelligent armored SUV that saves Sam Jackson's character. Others are underutilized, such as the 70s technology incarnation of the dead Nazi mastermind as an artificial intelligence data bank. He dies a couple of minutes after his resurrection. And Sam Jackson is predictably resurrected a couple of minutes after his death.Robert Redford is entertaining as the evil head honcho with a plan to kills a few 1000 people to bring order and peace to the world. These plots always make me wonder. Millions of people that die of hunger or war, due to bad but entirely avoidable political and religious policies, could perhaps be saved by knocking off just the right set of bad leaders. Perhaps this would be more ethical in the long run, a la Vulcan philosophy of 'the good of the many outweighs the good of the few...' (Or wait, did that come first in Bentham's philosophical treatise, or in the Bible, or even earlier?)The fact that one can ask such questions after seeing the film is a good sign, but the film remains full of wooden acting, improbable plot elements, lukewarm musical score, etc. It's smarter than most of the superhero flicks, but still solidly in B-movie territory. Definitely worth a single watch, though, and the 3D was not overdone.",6,3,6,11 May 2014
Interstellar," A nice homage to '2001'
","What would you put in a modern homage to '2001: A Space Odyssey'?-Docking to rotating space vehicle (for centrifugal gravity) with classical music? Check-Hibernation travel to an outer planet supervised by sentient machines? Check-An artificial 3-D environment constructed by aliens so humans can comprehend? Check-A device (here spherical, there rectangular) to transport us to said environment? Check-Colorful reflections on the hyperspace traveler's helmet during transport? Check-Explosion in an airlock while gaining access to a space ship? CheckThis was all far more visionary in 1968 than in 2014. Although not quite Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, Nolan and writers managed to construct quite a good homage, with a more personal story embedded in it than the 1968 classic. Taken completely by itself, the story is a bit trite, one might say at TV drama level, and this sinks the ticker to 8 stars out of 10 right there. It's a good story though, even if well-worn: a widowed father up against a choice to save the many, or to save his daughter. (His son is already beyond him to save, due to his own neglect.) Here, time travel through a wormhole adds the twist that a father must see his child die, but yet with another twist: she has lived much longer than he, and is surrounded by family and offspring. So her death is not tragic in the 'unfulfilled life' sense that a child's death is usually tragic. It is more like a reversal of the parent-child role at the deathbed.The many-dimensions-rolled-into-three artificial environment, so the space-faring father can comprehend, turns out to be created by our descendants from a far future. Fine. It seems that they should have been able to place both wormhole entrances near an ordinary G- or K-class star like our sun, instead of mostly uninhabitable planets near an exotic black hole. Somewhat of a story-ending plot hole. Still fine. But the silly 'happy ending,' where dad flies after his love interest, who is seeding humans near the black hole, definitely is pure Hollywood. Another star off, to 7/10. Where Spielberg's 'AI' should have ended when the ferris wheel fell on the AI boy as he saw the Fairie Godmother, this film should have ended with dad walking down the hospital hallway alone as his daughter dies of old age, rather than dad hi-jacking a spaceship from a secure facility and flying to the damsel in distress.The performances are solid and suitably under-played, and the actors and Nolan deserve a lot of credit for that. For otherwise the TV drama aspect would win out over the grand setting. Michael Caine is a nice celebrity cameo touch as the physicist who lures the film's hero with 'Plan A,' but really believes that only the much less pleasant 'Plan B' will work out. Nolan and Caine must have gotten on well on 'Batman.'7/10 is a nice film, and this is well acted, well directed, well set-designed, well CGId and generally well written. Definitely a film to see again, although I think history will not judge it as highly as the kind IMDb user ratings.",7,0,2,5 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Empire Strikes Back - Again!
","JJ Abrams had a tough job cleaning up loose ends, making sure all the main characters can make a meaningful appearance and still developing character relationships. With that in mind, the film came out pretty good, about at the level of Episode VII, a bit better than episode VIII.The film unfortunately has plenty of weaknesses, mostly due to scripting full of plot holes and fake emotional moments, pulling the viewer out of the story. Some examples:It overdoes the 'Oh Chewbakka is dead ... Oh, he's alive' 'Oh C3-PO is wiped ... Oh, he's back' artifices. If we know tragically wiped out characters are going to be restored within minutes anyway, the writers might as well spare us the cheap emotional tug. At least in 'Wrath of Khan,' Spock was dead until the next sequel!There are just too many plot holes that are critical to the plot and require heavy-duty apologetics to explain out of the way: If the Emperor's Plan A is to get Rey to kill him out of anger so the essence of the Sith goes into her, why tell her about it? She was coming to do exactly that, and explaining that this will seal his victory only deters her from doing what he needs to get done. After all, presumably he made himself hard to find via those Wayfinders to convince her that he does not want to be killed. It's like the bad guy at the end of old James Bond movies giving away the master plan, enabling Bond to push the self-destruct button.The list of such gaffes goes on and on, putting a dent in the beautiful set pieces, solid acting by the ensemble cast. nice John Williams music as always, glimpse of a young Luke training a young Leia, cute robots instead of overly cute little animals, and all that good stuff the film has to offer.A harsher judge might give it less than 7 because of the plot hole-filled script, or because of dissatisfaction that the Palpatine family ultimately pulls the strings, not the Skywalkers. A more effusive fan might give an 8 perhaps. For me, a 7 sounds about right: it was entertaining, it didn't do anything grossly negligent to the Star Wars Universe (besides suddenly making the Palpatines, not the Skywalkers, the ultimate driving force of the story), and I might see it again some day - but not too soon!",7,2,8,22 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Godzilla movies are back - a little too long
","The bottom line: a passable remake of 'Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla', a camp and fun Japanese production that invented city-bashing monsters fighting giant human-controlled robots. One thing Guillermo del Toro does not understand as well as the Toho gang: under 90 minutes, baby!Still, with del Toro at the helm, it can't be too bad, and indeed, he delivers expert direction, yet somehow it feels as though he must have been bored while making the film: Perhaps the unnecessary pauses between robot-monster action? The cardboard characters filling said pauses?The movie borrows liberally from the toolbox of action/horror/sf: We have the well-known actor who gets killed unexpectedly by the monster halfway through the movie (done better in 'Deep Blue Sea,' and invented by Alfred Hitchcock for 'Psycho', and in both of those films it was actually unexpected, but not here). The demure Japanese girl motivated by a strong father figure (straight from 'G vs. MG'). We have the rookie who gets no respect, two types of mad scientist, the stern commander whose authority is continually questioned by the hero. Etc, etc. It also is filled with inconsistencies: Let's build a steel-and-concrete wall to hold off monsters that break through skyscrapers as through they were cardboard, and abandon a fairly successful robot defense program. The stern commander realizes a piece of the monster is critical for the mission, but sends a lone chief scientist without ID to pick it up from a dangerous criminal who has government leave to harvest monster pieces. Wait, let's fight the monsters with swords, instead of burying hardened nuclear weapons near the rift and detonating one each time a monster comes out (we did real-life underwater nuke tests for years in the Pacific, and the fallout is much less than having whole cities eaten up). Speaking of swords, the monsters can be sliced into half by a sword, but they can crush through a skyscraper without visible injury, what with all those sharp steel beams poking out. Etc etc.Now to the good side: for the genre, it is expertly executed, if a little overlong. It delivers almost non-stop anime-style Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla fun, and with all due respect to the Japanese model builders of decades ago, CGI allows better interaction of monster and cityscape. The hero and heroine act together professionally, and only in one line of dialog does the writer/director team break down and go for the superfluous romance angle. The mad scientists are so overacted that it's actually good fun. And Ron Perlman gets a fun cameo, despite his overly obvious declamations before his demise.The movie does not rise in any way above the limitations of the genre (the way 'Deep Blue Sea' did), but it does hold the attention for about 90 minutes of its two hours and goes well with pop corn.",5,1,3,21 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Best of the prequels
","The prequel trilogy is no match for the original, if for no other reason that it rehashes similar ground 20 years later. But it's not bad space opera, and of the three prequels, I thought this one is the best.It suffers the usual problems of a middle segment without a real beginning, middle, or end, but the story really makes some progress here, taking us from an assassination attempt of Anakin Skywalkers's love Padme to a long-brewing plot to create an army of the Republic, soon to be an army of the Empire. The Jedi plausibly fall for the manipulations that lead to the need for such an army to counteract the Sith puppet, the Trade Federation. Film 2 also sets up all the key characters from an ambiguously good Anakin to the Emperor, and introduces great new ones, like Count Dookoo.You can't go wrong casting Christopher Lee as an evil mastermind. He and Peter Cushing, who played the evil mastermind in the original, are grand relics of the glory days of Hammer films, famous for the 60s Dracula and Frankenstein productions. It would have been great to have both of these good friends in the same film (and of sorts, they are in Episode 3). Alas, it was not to be due to Cushing's untimely death many years ago, but it's nice to see them strut their stuff in different parts of Star Wars.On the other hand, you can go wrong with Hayden Christensen's Anakin. The attack on Anakin's mother provides some background for his fall, but not enough. HC is just not up to the task: he can look brooding, but more like an awkward teenager. The same awkwardness permeates his attachment to the much older and more self-secure Padme. This role, in all three prequels, really needed a more weighty (literally!) actor, a big intelligent farmhand who resented his slavery and had a chip on his shoulder from his earliest days. The actors in the prequels try their best, but they just can't pull it off. They needed someone of David Prowse size with a voice that could mature into a James Earl Jones voice, not just someone with dark rings around his eyes.The movie has a lot going for it, though, besides Christopher Lee. Interesting chases of assassins and bounty hunters employing them, a Ewan McGregor who is getting more into his Obi Wan routine, a dark background story for the imperial storm troopers, the factory from hell, and a silly but awesome Roman Colosseum scene that segues into a serious battle, where the Jedi in the waning days of their wisdom employ their very undoing to win a temporary victory, as Yoda immediately recognizes. The John Williams music, now derivative of himself being derivative of Dvorak is still great. Some good use is still made of the humor of R2 and 3PO, but not enough. In general, the original trilogy had more fun being a humorous and adventurous space opera, whereas the prequels are lacking in the humor department (unless you think Jar Jar Binks is funny).As always, Lucas overdoes it on the special effects, and doesn't know when to cut what does not work (like Anakin flying fruit onto Padme's fork). One of the things that made John Carpenters The Thing so great was his good taste in when to cut out unsatisfactory special effects, as anyone who has seen the 'deleted scenes' from said film knows.Still, the film moves along nicely from beginning to end: not as relentlessly as most post- 2000 action flicks, which were scripted for an audience suffering ADD, and not as slow as a 'serious' sf drama like Solaris. If parts VII and onward are about as good as this, the audience should not complain too much. And the Abrams style is much more suited to space opera than to Star Trek in any case.",7,5,8,23 March 2014
Oblivion," Falls flat on logic after a promising start
","The screenwriters started with an interesting premise: 'How about a man who thinks he is fighting against aliens for humans, but he's really fighting against humans for aliens?' The theme is accompanied by a suitably stark setting, with remnants of NYC sticking from a war-devastated ground.By the third act, the screenwriters have written themselves into a corner, and the plot falls apart. Let's see, if I am a human who KNOWS that the man fighting me is being deceived by an alien into thinking I am alien, I'll wear alien masks and distort my voice while fighting him, to make sure he thinks I AM an alien. If I am an alien who has been monitoring an erratically behaving human servant, of whom I have 1000s of clones in reserve, I'll fly him into my inner sanctum without checking his cargo. Etc. Such glaring logical flaws are easily forgiven in a low-brow action flick, but not in an sf film that has higher aspirations.I watched Toy Story 3 right after this upon recommendation of my son. What a paean to plot logic and character development by comparison. Similar concept: a hero thrust into a strange environment realizes that the seemingly good are in reality bad. Just better written.",5,2,4,16 December 2013
Watchmen," Screams 'Comic Cult!'
","Having seen Watchmen twice, I must say it does not improve with age, but it does hold its own.The film presents a dark urban future, with Nixon in his fourth term in a war-room that looks awfully familiar from 'Dr. Strangelove,' and sex and death in the streets of America, and in the bars of Vietnam. WW III with Russia over the invasion of Afghanistan is imminent. Against this backdrop, an aging gang of all-too-human superheroes are getting killed one by one because they may be onto the world-salvation plan of one of their own, which has a small hitch: millions must die so billions may live. A familiar theme, also used in the more recent 'CA: The Winter Soldier.'The characters are exquisitely drawn, all of them: the main ones, whose formative superhero stories we see in flash-backs. The cameos, like a hilarious Henry Kissinger who looks and talks just too much like the real thing. And the victims - of criminals and of the Watchmen, for in this film EVERYONE is a victim. I have a soft spot for 'formation and decay of superhero' stories, so A+ for that.The film makes great use of songs, and of gratuitous violence, although I don't think it quite rises to the heights of 'The Crow' in that genre. But a film whose lead actor is killed for real in a killing scene (it was an accident, nonetheless making the Crow a Hollywood-condoned commercial snuff film) will be hard to beat on that account. I don't even think 'Watchmen' has something to beat the cigar cutter scene at the beginning of 'Darkman.' Still, I had to cringe many times, probably at exactly the times director Zack Snyder wanted me to.The film is sometimes too heavy-handed - think orgasm and flamethrower. Hitchcock pushed that one to the limit in North by Northwest, and here it went over the limit into corny territory. Some of the character motivations fall apart towards the climax. As the world's best quantum mechanic, surely Dr. Manhattan can see that every single human being, including the evil ones, is a coincidence as special as the love of his life. The film falls short of a masterpiece, but it is darn good.",7,1,3,7 February 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A landmark
","Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of 'Heavenly Creatures' and 'Dead Alive' did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the first film. I must say I was mesmerized from Kate Blanchett's narration to the end when Frodo and Sam march towards an exquisitely done matte painting of Mordor.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother.There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's 'By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)' - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a '10'). He forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade.",9,0,0,17 January 2014
The Thing," Truly mind-harrowing
","Carpenter is an outstanding horror-suspense director, but he simply outdid himself with 'The Thing,' crafting a horror film rarely touched by any other in intelligence or quality of the ensemble cast. The film truly captures the horror of Campbell's short story, light years ahead of the 50s version, while maintaining the same fearsome idea: that there could be things out there that will take us over, absorb us, and we would not even really know. It's a hysteria that drove many 50s science fiction flicks, but by the 1980s it could be reduced to its pure essence, without that heavy-handed 'US vs. the Soviets' thing.When I saw this in the theater in 1982, I felt queasy several times during the film. Yes, as in 'about to throw up.' It was the uncanny realism of the special effects. It has been remarked that The Thing, and the special effects that embody it, are truly a living character in this film, and it is true. Rob Bottin, Stan Winston, Bill Sturgeon, and the makeup/creature crew did things that could never be done as realistically with CGI effect. And director Carpenter uncompromisingly selected only the best of it for the final cut, as anyone who has seen the 'deleted scenes' can attest. Gone are any stop-motion animation or slightly imperfect scenes. The artistic triumvirate and its perfectionist director created the ultimate thing.The ensemble cast of characters, trapped in an Antarctic science station where a creature that absorbs all life forms in their own image gets them one by one, is amazingly good. Yes, Kurt Russell gets first billing and survives to the last, but every character, down to the Norwegian rifleman who tries to warn the Americans of their impending doom when a seemingly harmless husky trots their way, is perfectly cast and plays his perfect role in the grand scheme of things.The film scares, amuses, excites, spellbinds, disgusts, simply everything you could ask of a horror film. Every time I see it, I like it better despite knowing how every character will end, and how the web of dread, hopelessness and helplessness is cast to the bitter end by The Thing.",9,3,7,13 October 2015
The Revenant," DiCaprio CAN act when he wants to
","One of the worst bits of acting I ever saw was DiCaprio as King Louis Quatorze in 'The Man in the Iron Mask.' But then, one of the better bits of acting I have seen was DiCaprio as a man who gets mauled by a bear, watches his son get killed, falls off a cliff with his horse and then has to use the animal as a bivouac ... and so forth. Only reality can bring on such a series of life- and sanity-threatening events, and yet a human being is strong enough to survive and make it back to civilization, such as it is.The film tries to be ultra-realistic with settings, costuming, and language, and it mostly succeeds very well. The generally excellent camerawork is marred by a few strange choices. For example, when characters are breathing heavily in the cold, there is condensation on the camera lens (more likely, on a glass plate held in front of the camera!). If this is to elicit a 'documentary feel,' well, that would work if the movie were set in 1933, when Technicolor film cameras existed, but not in 1823. Pretending there was a camera catching real life in 1823 actually has the opposite effect: it takes you out of the story thinking what I just said above, and that diminishes the experience of the film.Not perfect in all respects, but very worth seeing for those who can handle harsh violence, scalping, (simulated) distress and death of animals, and so forth.",7,1,1,14 July 2019
Knowing," Not knowing
","Alex Proyas' Dark City is one of my favorites, so I came to this film with great expectations. It started out very promising for the first half.MIT mathematician Nicholas Cage catches on to the fact that numerical sequences scribbled by tortured schoolchildren have a deeper meaning: they seem to mark casualty numbers and dates of major and minor cataclysmic events from wars to airline crashes. As he investigates, there are many exciting set pieces: a plane crash really close up, burning deer wailing in a burning forest, mysterious government people - or aliens? The last of the numbers on the list is scary: the whole Earth's population. And the date is not too far in the future.At this point I was very impressed, thinking Proyas has done it again.Once expectations are built up high, the whole house of cards falls apart: the Earth will be destroyed by a gigantic solar flare, a cathartic cleansing for the evils of humanity, and aliens who see the big one coming, as they do all disasters, are going to save a handful of children, so they can live on a fresh zoo planet with grass that looks like a landscape made of wool. Why make these poor children go through such pain? Why write down the numbers? Why save so few when you can save so many? Why wait 'til the last second when you have decades to execute your plan? And didn't anyone ever tell you about the butterfly effect, which makes it impossible to make such predictions for open dynamical systems? The loose ends range from silly to unnecessary, and leave the moviegoer with a very dissatisfied taste in their mouth.It's a 4/10 for good production values and a great first half, but unlike your typical mediocre 5/10 action flick, such as the Neeson vehicle 'Non-Stop,' this movie is a real let-down at the end, and that's another star off. It reminds me very much of 'The Arrival,' another Aliens-Infiltrate-Earth movie that starts out great and mysterious, and then falls apart at the end.",4,4,7,9 February 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better if you're not too familiar with 1 & 2
","This is actually a pretty good action flick. The director spends some time on characterization, the chemistry between characters is pretty good, and there are plenty of amazing chase scenes (that crane truck seemed to lose more wheels than could possibly be on one when it crashed!), android action, etc.The real problem with the film is 'more of the same.' We already had a Terminator movie with a shape-changing robot pursuing a human hero protected by an older model electromechanical robot with a human skin surface. So now the hero is in his twenties instead of his teens. So what. The movie felt more like a reboot of Terminator 2, but without the masterful touch of Cameron. Not to criticize Jonathan Mostow too much: it is well-directed.The gruff 'I'm reluctantly getting to like you' chemistry between Nick Stahl (as the human here) and Claire Danes (as his future wife) works well. Comic relief is provided in well-times doses, such as when Arnold Schwarzenegger (the good robot) informs Danes that she will have Stahl's babies in the near future, at a time when she is decidedly in the 'reluctant' phase of the relationship. There are also nice cinematic devices, such as the gradual progression from night to twilight to dawn to day during the first big chase. Very expertly done.The movie has a lot of little plot holes, many of them associated with the idea of doing the same thing a third time over. If the machines of the future can send three terminators back, why not even more all over the place? And why is a machine as cold-blooded and efficient as the icy-beautiful Kristanna Loken so inefficient at doing its job? If you need to change from 'boyfriend' to 'Terminatrix' before you can use your weapon on Dane, just stay 'boyfriend,' get next to Dane, then wring her little neck! However, none of the holes are absolutely critical to the plot, which sails along just fine to a climax at an accelerator and a US deep cover installation.I'd say for someone not into the Terminator series, this would be a '7' action flick. For someone who adored Arnold and Cameron since 1984's first installment, it'll probably be a 5 for deja vu, seen that done better. So I'll award the average of these scores.",6,1,1,30 July 2015
Divergent," You will grow up and your parents will die eventually
","The film is not at all bad, if one takes it on its own terms: a fairytale disguised as young adult movie. It has all the ingredients: a surreal environment, moralism, odd characters (puss-in-boots, seven dwarfs anyone?). The message is the same dark message found in many fairy tales: You will grow up, the world is bad, and your parents will die.Shailene Woodley as 'Tris' has to grow up fast when Kate Winslet, leader of the brainiacs in a quintipartite society that lives in the fenced-in ruins of Chicago after WW III, decides it's time for the smart guys to take over. Tris joins the 'Dauntless,' the solider-faction that keeps the peace among brains, public servants, growers, and truth speakers (meet the press of the future?), not counting the homeless. As a 'Divergent' who embodies elements of all five factions, Tris confronts the master plan, and in the process, she must face her worst fears, find love, and see her parents die as she loses the innocence of her childhood. In this fairy tale, Tris and her Divergent boyfriend are thus the only full humans, or real people. The viewer will identify more with some factions than with others, but of course we are all divergent, and so it is easy to identify with Tris.There are problems that keep this well-intentioned film from reaching higher. For one thing, the dystopia is so sad (like a particularly grim Brothers Grimm tale), that I would have rooted for the brains, had their plan not included killing a fifth of the population. That plan is not very brainy. Why not just inflict the mind-control potion on the public servants directly, instead of on the soldiers? No killing needed, more population to do the bidding of the brains. If I were a scientist, that's how I would have arranged things...but wait - I am a scientist!In a fairy tale, we must not dig too deep for logic. Instead, there is a well-paced story with sympathetic lead characters, villains who are bad but convinced of their own goodness (almost always true of real political villains), and the moral pontificating is fairly minimalistic. I found it quite watchable for 2 hours and 17 minutes, although it would have been better with about 25 minutes cut out. That's true for many overly long action movies nowadays - few can hold to the line like Besson's 'Taken', a 90 minute fairy tale of princess in distress rescued by the king that's a good notch above this film because it is concise.Decently executed view-once coming-of-age story, like Hunger Games or Mazerunner.",6,1,1,13 October 2015
The Lego Movie," Everything is ... OK
","'The LEGO Movie' is a children's film in the category of toys that come to life, and may interact with their owners. Such films include the H. C. Andersen 'Brave Tin Soldier' segment from Fantasia 2000, accompanied by Shostakhovich's 2nd piano concerto, or Pixar's classic 'Toy Story.' How does 'LEGO' stack up (pun intended) against 'Toy Story'? I gave the latter an 8/10, and I would say 'The LEGO Movie' is at least 2 notches down. 6/10.Of course the best part is the LEGO landscapes. The director intermingles plenty of product lines, from Star Wars to Pirates to Duplo to Cityscape. It all would have been really impressive if it had been done with real blocks by stopped motion animation, like some of the fan shorts. Alas, it's just CGI, but at least they stuck to LEGO brick rules all the way through, as far as I could tell.The story is humdrum: an evil and not-so-special LEGO figure wants to glue everything together with superglue. In the real world, dad wants to do the same with his big basement LEGO project, so his son can't mess it up. To the rescue comes an ordinary LEGO worker figure who shows that anyone can be 'special,' and convinces the evil mastermind to stand down. A bit of pop culture reference is thrown in here or there, a bit of satire now and then, but none of it rises above the level of a 14 year-old bionicle user who may be watching, never mind a grizzled old moviegoer who wants to see something new.So the movie is what it is: harmless, fluffy kid's fare, lacking the charm of stop-motion animation LEGO shorts, with a 'theme song' that runs out of melody and lyrics in about 10 seconds. It's sure to spawn sequels to please the 6-10 year old crowd. And it should, they could be watching worse.The biggest irony: the only novel idea in the film was the double-decker couch!",6,2,3,15 October 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Jackson is warming up in part II
","In my review of part I, I noted that 'there is a great film within this film.' This is still true for part II, but the great film is closer to the surface here. Less cutting is needed.If one accepts the film on its own terms (and viewers generally do, no matter how great the book it is based on), there are many pluses: the story moves further in less screen time; more attention is paid to some of the characters; it presents a grander view of the events surrounding Sauron's re-emergence than Tolkien's marvelous book.In that regard, there are many worthwhile additions, such as Gandalf's investigation of Dol Guldur, or bringing out elves as characters (they are entirely nondescript in the book until the very end). In a wise scripting decision, Bilbo understands the language of the Mirkwood spiders only when he puts on the Ring. All this makes the film a better fit with the LOTR trilogy.There are also many bad decisions: 1) Diminishing Bilbo's character by not having him perform the heroic rescues as in the book. The whole idea of The Hobbit (and LotR) is that the common soldier, who does not even show up as a footprint in history, IS in reality the history. 2) The silly romance between elf Tauriel and dwarf Kili culminates in an incredibly sappy healing scene, where Evangeline Lilly is forced to stare vacantly while glowing, a real cringe-moment. This worked with Arwen and Aragorn, but Tauriel, you are no Arwen, and Kili, you are no Aragorn. Fortunately, it could be fixed by cutting 5 minutes from the 'Director's special shortened edition' while enhancing the Tauriel character, who together with Legolas and Thranduil puts some meat on the elves. 3) The whole liquid gold thing should have been cut when Jackson saw what the CGI looked like. 4) As in the previous installment, some action is so unnecessary, and so implausible physically, that it ruins the moment; like someone dashing across a river on the heads of randomly floating people; or someone floating in a metal bucket on molten metal without getting baked to a crisp. And so forth. 5) Most annoyingly, the screenwriters again weaken Tolkien's brilliant characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension. LOTR was guilty many times over, for instance when King Theoden is a wimp who hides in a burg waiting for disaster, instead of the decisive leader who recognizes quickly that Gondor must be helped; or the indecisiveness of the Ents to give Merry something to do, even though in the book they are slow, but not indecisive. And let's not even start with Frodo. Here Bard is turned into a smuggler for hire; Thranduil tries to cut a bargain with Thorin; elves SNORE (sacrilege!); the wizard wavers, instead of following his plans 100s of years in the making. And I already mentioned Bilbo as point number 1)..Yet the scenery is brilliantly imagined as always, the acting ranges from solid to very good, the story moves along nicely, so the nearly 3 hours pass quickly, and from a bird's eye perspective, no major deviations from the book are made, not worse than in the LOTR movies at any rate. The worst is a should-be-dead Azog bossing his should-be-son Bolg around. And of course that awful liquid gold.One gets the feeling that Jackson is at his most brilliant when he has little budget and time (Heavenly Creatures, Dead Alive), or is not yet recognized by Hollywood (LOTR), but overdoes it when given too much money (King Kong or here). Still, Jackson overdoing it is better than most fantasy film making. But alas, what could have been!",6,1,3,21 December 2013
Batman Begins," Pretentious remake
","I was not a great fan of the Burton Batman movies, but at least they captured a sort of semi-serious camp that befits a caped crusader who gets the police to project a bat sign into the clouds to fly in for help and justice.Nolan has made a couple of very good movies (including the time-reversed Memento), but once he gooses up with Hollywood, the charm quickly dissipates.With a lot of hollow pseudo-philosophy, the film stretches its characters well beyond the limit they can support. Why the good Dr. Villain can't afford a gas mask and has to make do with a burlap sack is not explained. And the 'evil mastermind destroys the world' sub-plot ends in one of the most inane climaxes put to film in a long time: a little microwave generator is supposed to blast toxic wastewater underground pipes open, but it seems to have no effect on the rain and wet streets that are mere meters from said pipes! Then the evil mastermind plummets to his death. And this story features one of the most trusting yet rapidly promoted cops you have ever seen.There is too much dark camera work, perhaps to hide the wooden acting by the major players and get the rating down from R, a mediocre score, and a 'love story' between two characters devoid of the slightest bit of chemistry.For some reason, this movie has attracted a lot of '1' and '10' votes. I would say a 5 is more like it: mediocre Hollywood 'reboot' fare, with a few brilliant actors (Caine, Freeman) wasted in brief scenes. I hear that the 2nd installment is better, but after seeing the 1st one, I have not been temped to replace the meme of campy 60s TV action yet, even though I'd like to.",5,1,1,19 March 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit
","There is a great film within this film. If Peter Jackson comes to his senses, perhaps he will create a 'Shortened Director's Cut' instead of an 'Extended Edition.' And if not, once the die-hard fans come to their senses and stop hailing it as a 10-star masterpiece, perhaps one of them will re-cut it.The Good: The 48 fps clarity is beautiful, although viewers accustomed to more ancient material will have to get used to it. Freeman steps into Holm's shoes perfectly, and Serkis, McKellen etc. are excellent at reprising their roles. The goblin king is great fun to watch - his double-chin is a character of its own. Speaking of character. One cannot fault the film for characterizing among the dwarfs only Thorin (Armitage), and to some extent the youngsters Fili and Kili: Tolkien's book does exactly the same! Jackson's photography is sweeping, with the fly-throughs and majestic landscapes viewers have come to expect. All in all, the story hews close to the book, with a few excellent cinematic add-ons: the prelude explaining how the dwarfs lost their home, without revealing the true shape of Smaug the dragon by using the device of a kite; the aside on Gandalf's councils with other elders, implied in the book (and chronicled in the Appendices to LOTR), but not part of Bilbo's limited point of view.The Bad: the Hobbit is a whimsical adventure tale, not meant to be on the scale of LOTR, and the film loses this flavor entirely with plodding, totally unnecessary, add-on action scenes. Between Trolls and Rivendell, our heroes are gratuitously beset by orcs. Mountain giants (akin to Ents of Stone in the book, but much larger here) fight around them without obvious motivation. The underground cave of the goblins is turned into a contrived roller-coaster ride reminiscent of the disastrous 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.' At a crisp 48 fps, elephant-sized goblin kings falling on characters from great height without killing them, or burning trees toppling like dominoes create a video game atmosphere, where the player simply uses his next 'life' and goes on playing. One of the central rules of Fantasy is flaunted here: that what happens to characters should obey common sense physics and psychology as much as possible, so the reader or viewer can truly believe in the fantasy. It is easy to imagine that a dragon can fly. It is much harder to imagine that an elephant falling straight on you will elicit nothing but a grunt and an annoyed remark.Cutting about 45 minutes out of this film will turn it into a vibrant 9-star adventure, which lies in waiting just like a statue inside Michelangelo's block of marble.PS: Like Tolkien's human editor, the IMDb editor does not like dwar-ves",6,7,15,25 December 2012
Non-Stop," Plothole extravaganza
","Liam Neeson almost carries this one through.Air Marshal Bill Marks has to deal with a deranged killer, who is knocking off passengers and pilots with a poison dart every 20 minutes. It becomes increasingly clear that the bad guy is not after the ransom, to be deposited in an account in Marks' name. He wants to avenge his father's death on 9/11, which he blames on the incompetence of the US government, and specifically then-NYPD fireman Marks. The film does a good job at keeping you guessing who the bad guy might be, and even the pretty explicit plot summary I just gave may still leave you surprised. Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery provide strong support, and if you love that actor combo, you may forgive the film its shortcomings.Those shortcomings are the Non-Stop plot holes. Now, I'm not one to search for accuracy or total consistency in action flicks. Let's face it, if things are moving fast enough, we can overlook the holes. But when the holes get big enough that you start thinking about them while watching, the script has failed. There is a trade-off between zipping along fast enough so you can't think about the holes, or zipping along slower but with greater consistency. Think 'Olympus Has Fallen' at one end of that spectrum, and 'North By Northwest' at the other end of that spectrum.I'm not talking about small holes, like a bomb that can't be thrown off the plane because a low pressure switch will set it off, but then when someone shoots out a window in the plane a minute later and the pressure drops, the bomb does not go off. The bomb went off a minute later anyway, no big deal for the plot. I'm talking about why US Air Marshals would hire a drunk with publicly known problems that are broadcast live to passengers on those little back-of-the-seat monitors. An Air Marshal supervisor who furiously refuses to listen to his employee trying to explain that if he were to hijack a plane, he would not put the ransom account in his own name! A non-suicidal helper of the suicidal bad guy who goes along with a plan to collect the ransom after parachuting off an exploding passenger airliner (he deserves the $150 million for stupid ballsiness). Or a pilot who needs to drop to 8000 ft to avoid an explosion, but never tells the escorting jet pilots ready to down the plane why he needs to drop altitude. And so on and so forth. These holes are both obvious and plot-critical, and for me they ruined the whole thing even as I was watching it.The movie also dishes up the stock characters and politically correct anti-stereotypes, like the Islamic MD complete with Taqiyah who is suspected by all yet innocent, versus the white 9/11 victim nice guy who turns out to be a terrorist. Sure, the US has its Timothy McVeighs, but I still say: Yawn!So a 5/10 it is, for solid acting that almost rescues this Neeson action vehicle, and for keeping me guessing who the real bad guy is. The film only partly satisfies in a single viewing.",4,1,1,12 February 2015
The Princess Bride," Innocent satire
","I was greatly amused by Rob Reiner's 'Spinal Tap,' although I am no fan of low-grade touring rock bands. I am not a big fan of romantic fantasy either, but I was enchanted by Reiner's 'Princess Bride.' There, I said it. I never thought I would use 'enchanted' in a review to describe my state of mind.In some ways, the Princess Bride is an awkward film. I got the feeling that the Director was like a fish out of water, and Reiner confessed as much in interviews later. Yet this is exactly what makes this film so great. Reiner came at it with the innocence of a satirist thinking 'Am I really doing this? Am I dreaming?' A sarcastic curmudgeon (that may be an exaggeration) finding his soft heart while directing a film. You feel like the film was a journey for its director, not just for its characters. Reiner is like the little boy unwillingly listening to grandpa's story, and wanting more, more, more despite professing he's not into 'that girly stuff.'The movie resolutely goes its own way, from the silly R.O.U.S. attacking our heroes in the swamp forest, to the smart aleck who outwits himself in a deadly drinking cup game with the Errol Flynn-like hero. Nothing is quite like you would expect, leaving you shaking your head, yet smiling at the same time. William Goldman outdid himself in the script, after penning a great book. It's not often that the book translates so well, in the hands of the original author.This and the 'Wizard of Oz' are really the only films I can think of off the top of my head that bring the words 'innocent' and 'satirical' to my mind simultaneously. The 'Oz' is a great film with Judy Garland in a great role, but on a scale divided into tenths, I have to give 'PB' the same rating. They're both unique fun.",8,1,2,20 October 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Hodgepodge
","The screenwriters are getting together.'Let's put in that scene from the book where the raptors quietly woosh through the tall grass, and one can see from the motions of the tall grass how the humans get picked off one by one. That will be visually arresting.''No, let's have a scene from Chrichton's next book, where the T rex swallows the dog and the doghouse still hangs from his closed jaw by the dog's chain. That's funny.''I have a brilliant idea: let's write a script where you get to see both! And to bridge them, we'll use the old King Kong on the ship meme!'The result is a hodgepodge of scenes populated by inanely stupid characters. Although not as stupid as in part III, which is why this one gets more stars. As sequels go, this is below average because the original film was so good. Better film, higher expectations for the sequel.If you want to see a few funny scenes and a few visually arresting scenes thrown together, and listen to some good music while doing so, watch Fantasia 2000 instead. A better sequel to an equally good original.",4,1,6,13 June 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Not Thantastic
","It seems that the Marvel films are slowly descending into loud action set pieces without very original or daring plots. AIW is a good example of this trend.Villain Thanos (probably a shorthand for the Greek Thanatos = Death because Thanos is the bringer of death) wants to collect 5 jewels that will allow him to snuff out half the galaxy's population so the other half can live better. Supposedly he's better than Hitler because he targets casualties at random, rather than a specific group. With all the energy expended on this quest, one wonders why his plan A was not simply to provide more resources for the galaxy, so all of its inhabitants can live better lives!He is opposed by the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. in a series of set pieces for each stone. The set pieces are OK little movies, but really nothing too inventive or exciting besides the usual action mayhem. Some of it is downright stupid, like the idea that opening your shield to let badass creatures in so they don't surround your shield is good war tactics; or Thanos' henchman deploying useless badass creatures in the first place when he has giant diggers to go underneath the shield anyway. And so on, and so forth.In an effort to provide every Marvel character a few minutes of screen time, the writing is diffuse, the action generic and the whole thing too episodic. Now, if at least they were to stick with the ending (half the galaxy's population dead, Thanos wins, many Avengers turned to dust) there would be something tragic about the 'Hitler wins' plot. But of course we all know they'll come back to life magically in the next installment, as hinted by Dr. Strange towards the end of the film. So therefore who cares if Gamora gets thrown to her Death. She'll be back soon enough.It's a bit sad because Thanos is a pretty good villain as Marvel villains go, and he deserved a punchier, more coherent film.Still, it's OK to watch once, and fans of the Marvel universe will of course find endless trivia in this movie, while those not familiar with MU will be slightly confused. It's a trend these days: theatrical releases becoming more like episodes in an old-fashioned 70s mini-series; and Netflix miniseries becoming better than theatrical releases. Ah well.",6,2,3,30 December 2018
Gone Girl," 'Body Heat' + 'Misery' = Meh
","This movie wanted it all: the plot where the insane woman frames her husband for murdering her (she framed the lover for her husband's murder in 'Body Heat,' but same idea), and the plot where the insane woman keeps her husband in the house against his will (it was a crazed fan and a famous writer in 'Misery,' but same idea). Instead, the sum of the parts is much less than the individual parts.I have not read the book, and so I must hope that its logic is constructed above the five-year-old-level. That's certainly not the case for this film. Its first two overly long acts work pretty well, gradually revealing the husband's sleazy behavior and downfall to (undeserved) murder suspect in act I, and then the wife's adventures on the lam, when she ironically gets fleeced by low-lifes in act II.In the third overly long act, the screenwriters have written themselves into a ridiculous corner: Accused of his wife's murder, hated by her parents, his adultery exposed on TV, with plenty of circumstantial evidence that she is a murderous psychopath and the police investigator on his side now, hubby Ben Affleck has nothing whatsoever to lose by dumping her. Au contraire, his life may be on the line. Yet he plays along with his insane wife's 'I'm coming home' ploy! He's motivated by an implausible explanation of how she owns his bar and might be pregnant with his child - the latter a situation that only arose in the first place because he took her back in! We have investigators who let her back to her home within a few hours of her mysterious reappearance, still drenched in her dead captor's (really: her dead victim's) blood, no need to investigate! There's plenty of additional silliness, but this shall suffice.To make a long story short: in mindless action movies, I wholeheartedly forgive plot holes. In a thriller, not. The last 45 minutes of this film are some of the silliest nonsense I have seen on the screen in a long time. Go see 'Body Heat' (1981) instead for a well done version of the first part of this movie, and then see 'Misery,' with an unforgettable performance by Kathy Bates, for a well done version of the last part of this movie.4/10 for strong acting by Rosamund Pike, who plays the girl turned into a nut job by her parents because they marketed her childhood as a children's book. Affleck also did a solid job, and an excellent supporting cast is at hand. If only they had gotten screenwriters of the same caliber on board, it could have been a 7: I am assuming the novel, with more space to explain and finesse the plot, does not descend into a pile of nonsense at the end.",4,8,13,1 March 2015
Django Unchained," Glourious Waltz
","I first saw Christoph Waltz in 'Inglourious Basterds.' Based on the title, I thought Tarantino had finally gone over the edge, but no, he stayed within a razor's width and produced the most amazing mish-mash of violence, Nazi culture, Jewish culture, war, and wishful thinking about Hitler and movie theaters, all carried by the incredible Waltz.Tarantino likes to work with certain buddies, and we get to see them along with Waltz in 'Django' (the D is silent). Like Brad Pitt, who is great here as the plantation owner who listens to his confidante Stephen, an Uncle Tom character played immensely well by Samuel Jackson, who is almost not recognizable in the role, that's how much he got into the character.The story moseys along well: Waltz (as the bounty-hunter Dr. Schultz) needs Foxx (who plays Django the slave) to identify some targets, and the two strike up a deal: Foxx helps out Waltz collect bodies for money, and Waltz will help him get his enslaved wife back from Pitt. 'Broomhilda von Shaft' is the name of this German-speaking slavegirl, in some exquisite irony that this film is full of. After all, we're talking Tarantino here.Tarantino serves up plenty of nice spaghetti western touches, from Morricone music, to Franco Nero, and the hyperviolence erupts at just the right times to make you wince, and at the same time think 'I guess there must be a lot more blood splattering around in real gunfights when people get shot in the head than they show in those ordinary western...'Still, the plot stumbles a bit as it gets into the unexpected twists and turns that Tarantino is so famous for. The first one works pretty well: Waltz finally shoots Pitt rather than shake his hand on a deal that would make all parties happy, such is his disgust for slavery and one of its main perpetrators. The second one is ridiculous, and this film is NOT 'Inglourious Basterds,' where a huge touch of surrealism works just fine: no slave handlers are going to fork over their weapons to a potentially dangerous slave, no matter how good his plan for making them eleven kilobucks. From there to the ending, the movie devolves into the surreal as in 'Basterds' or 'Apocalypse Now,' but unlike those films, it really does not fit well at the end of this period piece western. Yes, Tarantino has a penchant for being over the top, and we love him for it, but it just doesn't quite work here the way it did in 'Basterds' or 'Kill Bill' or 'Pulp Fiction.' This is a western, for crying out loud!So for a somewhat botched last half hour, but still pulling all the stops as deftly as usual, I give this one a 7/10.",7,0,2,17 October 2015
Get Out," Good fun, but not Oscar material
","'Get out' is a well-crafted little thriller, with just the right balance between dead pan humor, poking fun at stereotypes - like 'blacks stalking whites in bad neighborhoods' being reversed, 'TSA is less competent than police' being reversed, and so forth. There's even some mild horror action at the end.The premise is well-designed, as black dude Chris and his all-too-perfect white girlfriend meet her mom and dad, who show a little too much concern for his health. Little does Chris know that among the party guests at the parent's secluded estate, the one old blind guy who seems like an OK chap has designs on Chris' body and eyes. Chris is increasingly clued in that something very fishy is going on, with mom hypnotizing him, dad a weird brain surgeon, and the black groundskeeper, the black maid and a black party guest behaving oddly like white folks.Never mind that Chris' buddy, who works for the TSA, is smelling the roses when they chat on the cell phone, and tells Chris to get the hell outta there. It's too late when Chris finally discovers a shoebox with photos of his girlfriend and a string of previous black suitors, all gone missing.From this point on, the horror chapter of the script ensues, and it dips into the usual pitfalls of horror flicks, making 'Get Out' not even remotely worthy of Oscar consideration. Why for example would Chris' girlfriend string him along when he finally tries to 'Get Out,' instead of mom just immediately invoking her well-established hypnotic control over him? They needlessly endanger the good health of Chris' body, and they do want it in good health! But the scriptwriters wanted the 'nice character who seemingly supports the hero and goes 'bad' on him last' horror clichÃ© in the film. There are many such class-B horror movie artifices towards the end.The films lacks the cleverness of Hitchcock thrillers, the outrageousness of a Peter Jackson horror flick, but it has humor, and is well-staged to the bitter end, despite being fairly predictable about two-thirds of the way through. Thus it deserves a good chuckle, and provides a satisfying one-time view with some good surprises - That's worth a 7/10.",7,0,1,3 February 2018
2012," CA going down in chunks
","Emmerich really seems to be in love with runways collapsing behind airplanes taking off. We get this three times in the movie. Probably once would have been OK. Same with buildings on precipices so narrow due to everything around having collapsed a mile deep, that it is structurally impossible.But of course this is a disaster flick, not a documentary. So we can't expect the slightest physical accuracy in megavolcano explosions, continental shelf sinking into the ocean, etc.If you just hit the 'suspension of disbelief button' and get into the non-stop disaster action, the movie delivers pretty well, hence a 6/10. Not worth seeing more than once, but with a beer in hand, it can while an evening away. And Woody Harrelson is always great as the insane guy.Oddly, the 'bad guy,' played by Oliver Platt is actually right: you do not open the slowly operating hydraulic door of a humanity-saving ark a couple of minutes before doom, thereby endangering humanity's survival; you do not, like Danny Glover's US President, dramatically remain on the White House lawn while a tidal wave sends an aircraft carrier tumbling your way. Hurray to Platt for being the only person with common sense and the courage to make very hard decisions in this film. That was rather odd: most films at least manage to make me root for the hero and against the villain, but not here.Fortunately, neutrinos are not that bad in real life, even when the solar flares get big. And luckily, (big surprise!) then end of the Mayan calendar in 2012 was just one more of those doomsday prediction/conspiracy theories that did not come true.",6,2,3,2 April 2020
Hellboy," del Toro's imagination is always interesting
","Just for being different from typical action/monster/horror fare, this film is a 7/10. del Toro directed and scripted, and the film is very much with his themes (e.g. Nazis and demons in 'Labyrinth') and yet quite unique in its look and story.John Hurt as the professor who raises a demon captured from a Nazi experiment, and especially Ron Perlman as said demon (named 'Hellboy' and affectionately called 'Red' by his coworkers) deliver great performance. How nonchalant can a demon get? Well, Perlman will show you. Everyone on the cast, down to the German dominatrix, or Jeff Tambor playing the somewhat knuckle headed FBI agent who is not all bad, clearly enjoyed making this.Through flashbacks envisioned by a fish-man-demon and plenty of action involving subway trains, the movie leads us through Perlman chasing egg-laying hellhounds to dispose of a dead Nazi brought to 'life' by a mechanical clockwork, to climax in a final confrontation with none other than Rasputin, who holds Perlman's would-be fiery girlfriend hostage in a sub-sepulcher labyrinth to get him 'Red' destroy the Earth.If this sounds a bit weird and complicated, it's weird, but not too complicated. The film is well written and the somewhat unusual action and characters are easy enough to follow and empathize with.del Toro is a classic auteur like Terry Gilliam, with a touch more horror and a touch less social commentary, although films like Labyrinth and Hellboy clearly show del Toro's fascination with demons of the imagination, and demons of reality - such as Nazis.A strong 7 and a clear cult winner, fun to watch again even when you know already how it plays out.",7,1,1,3 February 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A strong second act
","Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of 'Heavenly Creatures' and 'Dead Alive' did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the film. In part 2, I must say I was mesmerized from Gandalf's aerial battle with the Balrog to Smeagol reverting to Gollum on the way to Mordor. I forgive the liberties Jackson took with Faramir manhandling Smeagol, as it does provide a reason for Gollum's re-emergence.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's 'By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)' - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a '10'). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade.",Null,1,2,18 January 2014
Stardust," Nice concoction with plenty of stars
","Michelle Pfeiffer as a sexy lethal witch with an aging problem is in better form than in 'Witches of Eastwick.' Robert DE Niro comes to the rescue out of the sky like the plumber in 'Brazil,' in a sky ship just like the one from Disney's 'Treasure Planet.' Ian McKellen narrates, and come to think of it, the hero's (Charlie Cox') theme bears some resemblance to the Fellowship Theme in 'LOTR.' At least there are no R.O.U.S. in it!Despite uncountable derivative elements, and a high degree of predictability (c'mon, who did not think it will be Pfeiffer vs. Cox at the end with starlight saving the day, 15 minutes into the show?), this film manages to remain charming, well-directed, crammed with great actors doing their work exquisitely, and a deft script.The story is great fantasy. Tristan, a grocery boy whose father once stumbled over 'The Wall' into a magical world right 'next to' England, saves a fallen star incarnated as a beautiful girl. The star is pursued by witches who want her heart for everlasting life, and princes Secundus through Septimus who need her jewel to become king, but die like flies instead. The star gives her heart willingly to Tristan, aptly named after a German legendary prince: His mother is Una, the dying King's firstborn, whom his father had wooed during that one night over 'The Wall' many years earlier.It is no 'Princess Bride' however, a film that was starry-eyed where this one is just a little too glib and derivative. De Niro is great, but the drag show is a somewhat desperate attempt to be different. Having the evil witch give up, only to rise suddenly once more, is just like those all-too-expected endings of horror flicks where the dead monster pops up one last time for a gratuitous scare. Having the star profess her love to Tristan while he's hexed into a mouse, but then he confesses he understood everything is an old 'overheard monologue' trick. At least he was a Rodent Of Usual Size. And yes, those notes from the LOTR 'Fellowship' theme got a bit annoying after a while.Still, while the film is not great, it is very, very good: well-paced, with plenty of action, romance, comedy, scare, visuals, and fairy-tale. Matthew Vaughn is a versatile craftsman, having directed everything from crime thrillers to superhero flicks ... to this great little fantasy tale, worth seeing more than once.",7,2,2,20 October 2015
A Quiet Place," Monster film with a people focus
","A Quiet Place is a good film, far better than most monster films. It actually deserves to be called a 'Monster film' instead of a 'Monster flick.'The reasons are pretty simple: The writers (Woods and Beck) actually made sure that the characters are carefully introduced, that we get to know the interpersonal dynamics of the family from the get-go, as parents and children hide quietly from blind monsters that use echolocation and sound to home in on prey. Director John Krasinsky paces the plot well, and makes the most of excellent acting by Emily Blunt as the mother, himself as dad, and Millicent Simmonds as the headstrong daughter. The musical score is simple and menacing, which fits a film with little talk better than the usual symphonic scoring. And for the most part the plot is fairly plausible. This places the film at par with other good horror thrillers, such as Final Destination (in which people escape a plane crash, only for death to reckon with them via bizarre lethal accidents), or Nightmare on Elm Street (in which victims are stalked in their dreams and die in their sleep).Too bad A Quiet Place can't quite make it to '8', where Hitchcock Thrillers reside because of their airtight plots. Here we do have creatures that one minute can burst through a thick-gauge steel grain silo, but the next minute can't punch through the cabin of a pick-up truck. A creature that pauses conveniently to allow dad and daughter to say good-bye via a lengthy sign language conversation before dad sacrifices himself. And as a scientist, I have to say the first thing I would think when confronted with blind critters that use sound to 'see,' is: 'Hmm, if bright light confuses people who see, maybe shrill sounds will get these critter's defenses down.' So if mom can kill one easily with a shotgun at the end of the movie while daughter emits a shrill sound, I think engineers and scientists of the industrio-military complexes of the world would have figured this one out within a few hours. So the 100s-of-days-postapocalypse, no-radio-stations-in-the-world-answer-anymore scenario does not make much sense.In the typical turn-about fashionable right now, for which 2015-2025 films will undoubtedly be stereotyped 30 years from now, the boy is scared and the girl is strong and resourceful, while dad can't do better than kill himself and mom is a superhuman who won't make a sound stepping on a nail while giving birth. Still, the film presents the characters in much detail to make this all seem right, which is more than one can say of other recent movies that take sweet revenge for decades of oppression of women in the movie industry.A 7/10 good enough to see again, even when the suspense is a bit less once we know where it leads.",7,2,3,2 June 2018
The Hurt Locker," Is that what it's like?
","In war, the people you try to make connections with could die at any time. The people you should connect with at home become remote anecdotes in your life. Your bloody job is all that's left. Thus is Kathryn Bigelow's lesson.I have never been in the military, so those who have seen it first-hand must comment on the accuracy of 'The Hurt Locker.' Yet this film feels direct and close to the truth. There are not many adornments, besides what a changing constellation of three men in a bomb squad encounters week after week. The simplicity of reality is powerful in this film.Yet it is not a documentary. Take the music, for example. A blend of natural sounds from crowd murmur to wind, the chop of helicopters, echoing mid-eastern music, and undertones of menacing deep sounds. It is not a conventional score, but it supports the emotions that arise while viewing this film quite well. It's not easy to find alternatives to the power of a full symphony orchestra when it comes to controlling viewer emotion, but the soundtrack by Jorgensen/Ministry provides such an alternative.The story itself is linear, as the days in the field roll by in Humvees, and Sargeant James (Jeremy Renner), who loves his job more than anything else left in the world, pushes his squad to the limit. He will abandon the mission disabling a device locked to an Iraqi family man just before detonation, but nothing short of that will deter him. His own child is a total stranger, while an Iraqi teen who plays soccer with him is killed so a body bomb can be sown into his belly.Paranoia is constant even if 99% of the strangers whose language you don't speak are actually friendly, just trying to get on with their lives. But 99% is not good enough. Could you take a 1% chance of death every day of your life? It's hard for someone who has never seen this up close to imagine what it might be like, but this film is about as good a jog for the imagination as you are going to find. It ranks high among war films because it refrains from glorifying or accusing, judging or preaching. It just lets its soldiers be. All you can be.",8,1,2,23 October 2015
Ex Machina," Passable debut
","Bad boy makes girl AI. Good boy likes girl AI. Girl AI demonstrates her sentience by pretending to like good boy so she can escape. Bad boy gets killed.The film is pretty entertaining for the first half or so, if you buy its somewhat sexist stereotypes: (a) male computer nerds want nothing more out of AI than a sentient female sex toy; (b) a female AI's big goal will be to use her sex appeal to escape the clutches of her evil 'dad' creator. Let's call it 'lowest common denominator AI.'After about half an hour, plenty of hints have been dropped: the main female AI (Ava) states that her greatest wish is to escape and go people-watching at a street corner; a 'hidden' but obvious second female AI cuts vegetables with a knife and is abused by her creator; other female AIs are locked in cupboards. At that point, it's clear that this will end with Ava free and watching people at a street corner, and with bad 'dad' and his young nerdy helper either locked up for eternity, or knifed, or some such unpleasant fate. And that's exactly what happens.On its way to that inevitable conclusion, the film manages to be pretty entertaining at times. There is interesting chemistry between the female AI and the nice but naive young computer nerd testing her. There is a cat and mouse game of young computer nerd and genius AI-designer: who can outguess whose next move better? There is voyeurism, and meta-voyeurism, and meta-meta-voyeurism, as there should be in any film about recursive self-programming code. There are AIs peeling of their skin to tip off humans. And humans who start to wonder if they're just a bunch of code and hardware covered by fake skin.Things fall apart at the end. Why is one AI allowed to run around outside and use knives during the whole film, while Ava must be locked up? Surely better and safer ways can be found to test the sentience of the locked-up one. Has Ava thought about when the power of her 'inductive charging' will run out at that street corner? And so forth and so on. A typical case of scriptwriting oneself into a corner, which I did NOT expect from Alex Garland: he may be a first time director here, but he's not a first-time script writer.I give it a 6/10: OK to watch once, but I suspect the appeal of this film will gradually decline with viewers and critics. Stanley Kubrick managed a far more ambiguous and equally murderous AI in 1968 with HAL 9000. Even 'AI,' a project Spielberg took over after Kubrick's death and botched, is in many ways better than 'ex machina.' Neither of these films bothered with awkward exposition dialogue about what a Turing test is, and other low-brow conversation that is totally unlike what would be going on between two top computer guys on a project. There are plenty of other good AI movies and TV shows. Heck, at least 'Mudd's Women,' the campy Star Trek episode about a planet full of female androids, revels in its 1960s political incorrectness. So for now, there are plenty of better ex machina alternatives around.",6,1,3,7 August 2015
Coco," Wow - Â¿podria estar muerto, por favor?
","I remember being blown out of my socks by the first Pixar movie, which I saw at an animation festival in the mid-80s: A child-lamp playing with a ball, squishing it, and getting consoled by mother-lamp. It was only a minute of computer graphics, and the CGI was amazing for the day, but the short film differed deeply from similar efforts of the era: it actually had a story!Fast forward, and things have not changed: still state-of-the-art in visual quality, and still outstanding stories. Even their second sequels (Toy Story 3?) are far above the level of most animated films.Coco is no exception. The story of a boy, who first has to learn the value of family to understand that only that knowledge can fulfill his life's dream, is amazing. How do you make skeletons charming? Well, that question is answered in Coco! In all aspects, from the musical numbers, to the voice characters, to the storytelling, and of course the colorful animation, this is a superb film.I almost feel guilty for not giving it a 9 or 10, but while the film did give me a lump in my throat, it did so using well honed plot twist techniques, such as turning an apparent hero into a demon, or swiftly reconciling people even though one of them has hated the other for 100 years. The tricks of the trade are applied here as deftly as I have ever seen, but the best of the best don't need to apply them at all.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A very good Episode Five-prime
","The Empire Strikes Back was a well-done bridge between the original film and Return of the Jedi. Likewise, The Last Jedi occupies the same ground within the third trilogy.The close analogies between episode IV and VII (android on a desert planet, cantina-like scene, death-star-like planetoid destroyed at the end) continue galore between episodes V and VIII: rebels rousted from their base by an imperial attack, a young Jedi-wannabe learning from a (reluctant) master, rebels regrouping at the end. In many ways, the newest trilogy so far is a remake of the original, with bigger special effects and a new generation of characters taking over.The film offers an interesting interweaving of plotlines, lovable and hatable characters, and plenty of surprises - those that one might expect to live die, and those that one might expect to die, live. It also has the great John Williams music, which is slowly switching over from old themes (imperial march) to new ones as a new generation leads the fight. And even the salable creatures (porgs, salt critters) are not over-played. Alas, there are a number of entirely avoidable reasons why 8 can't rise above a 7.First and foremost are the completely unnecessary plotholes. For example, Leia (who can survive in vacuum) could evidently remove the pile of rocks at the end of the film. Why the need to wait for Rey? Solution: just have them both do it simultaneously, and face each other with surprise when the pile of rocks has been lifted. Or take the whole 'Holdo-keeps-her-plan-secret-from-Poe' thing. Plain silly. Solution: have Holdo announce her plan of squeezing in under the radar right from the get-go, as any sane leader would. Poe can still put his head together with Finn and Rose to hatch a 'plan B' that they think is more likely to succeed, and then battle Holdo over it when she finds out what's going on behind her back. Yes, it would make Poe a somewhat more insubordinate character (rather than acting against inaction, he would be acting against a plan), but Holdo would look more like a competent leader than a secretive fool. These plotholes abound throughout, and each one could have been fixed with proper tweaks of the script and without altering the flow of the story significantly. Instead, the screenwriters went for cheap artificial tension at the expense of believability of the characters. Star Wars deserves better than that.The second 'bad' is the one-liners and flippant gags. Like Luke tossing the light saber over his shoulder, instead of handing it back to Rey. Or Luke quipping '..that's pretty much nowhere' when Rey tells him the name of her home planet. As a fan, this stuff annoyed me the most. The laudable thing about Star Wars is (or was!) that while being an all-out space opera, it once upon a time had a certain gravitas to it. It was told with earnestness, like the young children at the end who retell the tale of their heroes. They may be moving home-made action figures around, but they are serious! The quips and insipid gags put an unnecessary chink in the armor of Star Wars. There's enough cynicism in our galaxy. So shame on the scriptwriters for going for cheap laughs in a galaxy far, far away...They did get a lot right though, and the actors acted well. Especially Mark Hamill did what he could with his material. And there are many nice touches, from letting us see a bit of Phasma's face through the chink in her armor before she falls to her death, to the little boy at the end calling the broom to his hand as a hint that the light side of the force is biding its time.So, well done all in all, and what was not well done, one could easily fix by editing about 5 minutes of this very long film. Perhaps the Director's cut?",7,2,7,31 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Mildly fun set-piece space opera
","Guardians of the Galaxy tries hard to be good, and it almost succeeds! Its ultimate downfall is a lack of compelling villains for the heroes to battle, and no compelling goal for them to aspire to.The movie introduces a motley crew of characters. Among them, a smart-talking raccoon ( Bradley Cooper as 'Rocket') and his talking tree (Vin Diesel) stand out as the ultimate comedian and straight man. After all, how much straighter can you get than utter the same three words? Stan Laurel saying nothing to Hardy's antics would be about it. The pairing works really well, and provides all the interesting characters and comedic sidelines in this movie. Zoe Saldana's green lady and Chris Pratt's overly self-conscious hero are much more lackluster. The rest of the movie is populated with equally one-dimensional stock characters, like the pirate ship captain who abducts Pratt as a little boy and then wants to kill his protégé, only to decide he's buddies, only to decide he's going to kill his protégé, only...The plot is not very exciting, and involves a string of unrelated episodes. The 'rough bar at the edge of the galaxy episode;' the 'rough prison episode;' the 'thwart attack on innocent planet episode;' the 'lab of mad scientist episode' (not necessarily in that order, but it makes no difference).The weakest point of the movie is its villains. They are among the least inspiring villains in a long while, with petty motives of destruction, guided by a device contrived to allow everyone to hunt it, although its purpose is unclear and its usage artificially tailored to the needs of the grand finale. Villains are much more interesting when they are as sharp as the sharpest good guys (here the raccoon), not when they are mumbling figures with vague motives of galactic destruction. Take in contrast Robert Redford in 'Winter Soldier:' he wanted to knock off a few thousand of the worlds most useless bureaucrats and bad government honchos to make our planet a better place. I was rooting for him!So while Mr. Raccoon and his straight man get a 9/10 from me, the weak episodic plot and the lackluster villains take this film down to 6/10. Definitely not a new Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark. But a nice try, worth one watch, and sure to spawn sequels, which might be better than the original, just like 'Wrath of Khan' easily outstripped 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture.' I'll check out #2 in the hope my wish comes true.",6,1,5,27 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Brilliant on brilliance
","I expected to enjoy this film, and it met all my expectations.Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant as the brilliant game theorist/mathematician/computer scientist who broke the Nazi Enigma code. The fact that he was also a gay loner trying to imitate others at the game of life, was poignantly woven into the story, but not in the in- your-face way that some activist movies do so heavy-handedly. Every element of this film is well-conceived and put together, from the scenes of Turing brooding in his house, to his odd platonic love affair with a brilliant puzzle solver played by actress Keira Nightley, to the scenes of combat and destruction that juxtapose with the brain- work of chess players and mathematicians trying to break a code before Britain loses the war. The film has its evil player in commander Denniston, played wonderfully by Charles Dance. We cannot help but sympathize with him, if we are honest with ourselves: Turing's plan is so improbable, would we not have tried to fire him after a year of arrogantly wasted money? Every character in this film has complexity, but without the over-development that occurs in some biopics.I particularly give this film credit for picking up a maligned and difficult-to-defend concept: that it can be more humane to look at the grand picture and do what is right, rather than let your emotions dictate your actions of the moment. It comes across when Turing stays his colleagues, who are about to save hundreds of people after cracking the code. Turing immediately realizes that to save millions, these hundreds must be sacrificed so the Germans can be kept in the dark and the knowledge of Enigma can be used subtly and to the greatest effect.My wife is not a big movie buff, so when she really likes a film, it must be good. She really did like this film. I can tell because she paused it several times to ask questions about it. Usually she is happy to let it zip by as fast as possible, give me the x2 button on the remote!Norwegian director Morten Tydlum only makes a film every 4 years or so, and I swear they have been getting better and better with time. I once so much hoped this would happen to M Knight Shyamalan, who started out with a wondrous ability to blend the real and unreal, but lost it the more money he was given. Let's hope Tydlum keeps his deft touch even after Hollywood throws more money at him.",8,3,5,13 October 2015
Clash of the Titans," Flat remake
","'Timeo danaos, et dona ferentes,' as Julius Caesar himself said. Perseus is the legendary founding father of the Mycean Danaans, but in this film, beware of what he bears: a lackluster performance in a lackluster remake.The plot substitutes Hades for Poseidon as the wrathful God, and Perseus' female chaperone Io for princess Andromeda. The main purpose of the latter seems to be to allow a female character to tag along for the quest; maybe not necessary when you are making a teen-boy action film.The strangest thing about this movie is the mash-up of special effect elements from other fantasy films, rather than coming up with its own elements. For instance, we have Ray Harryhausen's scorpions blown to gigantic size, so like the oliphaunts in 'The Lord of the Rings' they can bear tents on their backs guided by desert people.The script writing is weak (Perseus curses 'like hell' a lot, instead of 'like Hades'; his motive is base revenge instead of noble love and salvation; etc) and derivative (of the original and LOTR of all things!), the characters are pretty anemic, with the Gods more human than the humans.A mediocre film than can be watched once, not bad enough to get upset about, not good enough to displace any of the memes created by Harryhausen for the Perseus myth.",4,0,0,7 February 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Failed attempt at character development
","Age of Ultron is an odd mix of action episodes interspersed by attempts to take cardboard characters and give them a human element. The latter fails pretty miserably. The characters just get slightly more boring with each installment, and their love interests and background stories are insipid. This all works much better in the graphic novels than with live action.The physics is bad, as always in these films. Here the problem is energy conservation. Cracking an asteroid-size chunk into smaller pieces to avoid disaster won't work too well: A single smaller impactor is less powerful because it is smaller, but if I cut a larger impactor into several smaller pieces a few 100 meters before impact and let all the pieces still hit simultaneously next to one another, the kinetic energy turned into heat remains the same. Woe to the Earth. Fortunately, it looked like the vibranium engines had not accelerated the impactor to the several km/s speed necessary for a disastrous impact anyway. The chunk had barely flown up a few km (humans were still breathing) and took way more than 1 second to fly back down. Soft landing. Stupid Ultron. Luck to the Earth, even without Avengers intervention.Ultron was about the only interesting character in this movie, and not developed enough. He put a sarcastic face on the old Terminator 'Rise of the Machines' idea that an AI will conclude that humans are superfluous. However, Ultron seemed to have nothing against plants and animals, hence his destructive plan seems a bit over the top. Surely an AI so smart could have figured out some bacteriological warfare method to get rid just of the humans.Basically, the film shuffles along OK from one action set piece to another, providing somewhat mediocre summer fare entertainment. I think this series has lost its touch. Sad because I really enjoyed the first 'Ironman,' when Downey, Jr. had to put together a suit from scrap metal. Fewer resources, better result. This seems to be the problem with many action movies these days.",5,9,19,13 June 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," A film stripped to the bare essence of film
","Film is a visual medium, and Kubrick was one of its greatest experimenters. Every one of his films is an experiment in its genre. Every one of his films successfully takes its genre in a new direction. For SF, 2001 is no exception.The film contains half hour+ stretches with no dialogue, only minimal classical music. Yet these stretches can hold an intellectually inclined viewer spellbound, just soaking in the images. Even the decisions forced on the director (such as leaving out the aliens in the final alien encounter) are worked in favor of the film. And of course Kubrick's decision to leave out an electronic score (albeit a well done one) in favor of unedited classical music that ranges from quietly disturbing to exuberant - or just not to have any music at all - makes the film watchable and listenable decades after its conception. Every set piece - and the film is nothing but a series of visual set pieces, is priceless, from the Pan Am stewardess doing a 360 degree walk in the space plane, to an astronaut fighting for survival in the quiet vacuum of outer space, to a conversation with a sentient machine gradually reduced to his (not 'its') oldest memories, becoming senile at the hands of his human antagonist.Of course current audiences used to modern CGI will notice flaws: the proto-humans have that odd combination of realism yet costumed fake-ness that only real acting (and really good acting, at that) in a costume can provide. The multiple-exposure masks used during flight scenes to block off the star field are not always perfectly aligned against the space ships. Unable to get the engine fire and dust upon landing right, effects master Doug Trumbull decided to just forgo it. Yet these peccadilloes pale by comparison to how accurately physical laws are modeled and represented in every detail in this film, especially in view of the cartoonish and video-gamish liberties taken by the current slew of SF action films. 2001 almost stands alone in how accurate it is physically.2001 was a watershed for SF films. Like another of Arthur C. Clarke's masterworks, 'Rendezvous with Rama,' it does not try to explain, it just lets be. Unfortunately when 'Rendezvous with Rama' finally gets made, it will probably be turned into a current-generation mindless sci-fi action movie with plenty of outer space sound effects and horrific spider monsters coming after the humans. The problem right now is that big films have become so expensive to make, that deviating from formula, as Kubrick always did, is just not a safe option anymore. This will change: CGI will become so commonplace and inexpensive, that we will see a generation of smart films with CGI in 10-15 years.",10,1,4,21 December 2013
Elysium," A solid 'save the world'
","As in many Hollywood 'save the world' sci-fi action movies, the hero dies just as he saves his loved ones, the new world is not for him. The sappy ending is in stark contrast to the director's penchant for blowing up bodies, faces, you name it, in slow bone and face-tearing sequences.The premise is standard: a world divided into have-nots and haves, the latter secluded in a paradise. This ground was treaded more expertly in the Sean Connery vehicle Zardoz (and you cannot beat Beethoven's 7th as a sound track), but Elysium still does a solid job. Of course, a space station is an unlikely Elysium for the rich, what with all the transportation and supply problems, vulnerability and so forth. A subtropical island chain would have been more realistic, but the writer (who also directs) can be forgiven fully because Elysium is not needlessly blown to pieces at the end. It just makes a neater-looking destination than any old island.I was worried for a bit after the bad would-be military dictator (played tight-lipped by Jodie Foster) died, and it looked like a typical cheap showdown between hero and the exoskeleton-powered hired hand of said dictator was going to be the finale. But then that one gets dispatched quickly also, and a more gentle but nefarious 'good bad guy' is up next. In fact, the way Foster's character dies is genius scriptwriting in hindsight: when she realizes that the new world order is not her style (with all those poor Spanish-speaking people living happily ever after), she stays a nurse's hand and rather bleeds to death instead.The ending is sappy (compare that to the infamous 'aging' scene at the end of Zardoz), but the movie is well-intentioned, the action keeps coming in good doses, the characters are drawn just enough so one can slightly care for them. All in all not a bad way to waste an hour and fifty minutes.",6,1,2,18 December 2013
Taken," Wow - Hold on to your seat!
","I like films involving Luc Besson as writer or director - think 'Leon' or '5th Element.' Besson's a love-or-hate kind of guy. This one, I fell in love with.In the 90 minutes that should be reserved for this sort of action drama, as opposed to the now-common 2+ hours, Neeson, Besson et al. serve up a taut film about a father who rescues his estranged daughter from sex kidnappers who grabbed her on a Paris vacation.The first part of the movie does a very good job in 20 minutes of drawing the characters, albeit stock: the estranged husband and father, the step-father who seems to do everything better than dad, the daughter-father bond that nonetheless persists strongly. Then we jump right in!One of the best aspects of this film is that it takes you through the whole chain of command of sex-trafficking operations: first the 'contact,' a young guy who finds out where the girls live and that they are alone; then the low-level kidnappers; then higher bosses who run the pre- selection and drug up the girls to get them subdued; then higher-level traders who take the best merchandise to satisfy rich men with a lust for virgins; and finally the ultra-rich sheik on a yacht, who represents the top-level predator in this disgusting food chain.Liam Neeson disposes of all of them swiftly and painfully as the movie proceeds towards the final rescue of his daughter. Some girls don't make it, others are lucky and Neeson needs them for information. This is true for a former French sécurité honcho whose wife, a personal friend, Neeson shoots in the leg to get the truth out of him. Both live when Neeson gets what he wants.The aggregate is as implausible as all such action flicks, but until the last 15 minutes, Besson et al. keep it fairly realistic. Unfortunately, it finally descends into heroes surviving against machine gun spray fire, implausible jumps from bridges, heroes that should be in police custody at the end but mysteriously end up home without a scratch, and such accoutrements of the action film. These were not actually necessary for the plot, so they are forgivable and I give it 8/10. A fun and fast evening!",8,1,1,9 April 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Beethoven's Scherzo is never quite the same
","I should probably be upset at this film. Beethoven's Scherzo (never mind Freude, schöner Götterfunken) is one of my favorites, and now almost every time I hear it, I think at least fleetingly of brutal sexual assault because the film immediately comes to mind. At least in 2001: A Space Odyssey the images that come to mind are of rotating space stations and trans-warp distortions.Although its Russo-British the-world-has-gone-down-the-tubes is a bit dated, Clockwork is a compelling alternate universe. In the film, gangs of high school hoodlums whose parents barely pay attention to them kill, rape, and intimidate one another at night. The narrator, who's a smart and charismatic kid and might have turned out OK, is scary in his matter-of-fact narration of the story, which swiftly takes him into the hands of unscrupulous politicians as a guinea pig for a Pavlov-like conditioning to rehabilitate criminals on the double.The film has many themes, but the theme of choice is inherent in all of them. Take away a person's ability to choose, and you cannot have true good or evil. As a dystopia, the film fails to find any good in anyone, except perhaps its main character, and in the priest who calls out the question of choice. The parents are whining, inattentive cowards; the politicians are ... politicians; the nurses care more about sex than patients; the doctors are cold-blooded beasts; the police are as brutal as the criminals; even the liberal, whose wife died as a result of our anti-hero's rampages, yet who wants to help him find choice again, rejoices at the pain when he applies Beethoven saturation-training to undo the governmental conditioning.Kubrick never made a bad film, or even a merely good film. This one is no exception. Perhaps I am giving it only an 8 because I'm ticked off a little every time I hear the Scherzo.",8,1,3,13 June 2015
Groundhog Day," See it again and again...
","After I saw it for the first time, I saw it again... and again... and again. Kind of like Bill Murray's character must have felt in this awesome romantic comedy.We all wish occasionally that we could turn back time to fix our mistakes. Murray, portraying a TV weatherman trapped in a one-day time loop actually gets to do it. At first, he does not realize what good luck he has. Reporting on groundhog's weather prediction capabilities is about on his list where a root canal ranks. He's just that kind of a cynical ass. When he wakes up on the same day over and over again, it seems the gods have punished him. But then he begins to fall for his intelligent and pretty colleague. At first, he woos her with cheap one- liners and tricks that just don't seem to work. Then he starts making life-changing efforts, such as spending months (years?) to study the piano so he can impress her. Still not right, but you now realize how serious he has become, spending years of his life learning something constructive to achieve a goal. After a near-death experience to get out of the loop, he is finally redeemed, and the gods seem more merciful.The movie is great on many levels. As a modern scrooge story; as a romantic comedy; as fantasy. You name it. It is well directed, well edited, and well played by all. A truly remarkable achievement among 90s comedies, which features quite a few good films in the US and abroad in that genre.Well, I'm going to have to see it again...",8,0,1,5 January 2015
Total Recall," Not Dick, but great anyway
","Verhoeven's opus is one of the last non-CGI sci-fi action films, and one of the best Schwarzenegger vehicles. The effects in this film are lovingly done, and always memorable, even if they don't quite achieve photorealism: 'The Lady' at the spaceport (aka Arnold = Douglas Quade in disguise); pulling the probe from Quade's nose; the scene where the camera sweeps away from the train window to Mars; and of course those bulging Mars-eyes at the end. I enjoy the mastery of physical effects whenever I see it again.This film has some of Arnold's better acting, and the support cast is great: Sharon Stone as the 'wife' to keep Arnold under wraps, the sweaty psychiatrist, Mel Johnson as the cab driver with a skeletized double arm, Ronnie Cox as the embodiment of corporate evil, and Ironsides as his henchman. And that's only the start. Verhoeven really gets the best out of his staff, and proves once again, as in Robocop, Starship Troopers and Basic Instinct that he is an auteur of gritty action-drama. I know it's heresy, but at his best he's like a violent Hitchcock.Don't look for Phil Dick's true spirit here, although the film nicely rehearses the paradoxes of when is dream reality and reality dream (e.g. the psychiatrist scene). Verhoeven made the topic his own, in a good way, with less of Dick's intellectual probing, and more action.It's too bad they don't make films like this any more, and instead make them like the 2000s sequel: boring, flat, fake-looking CGI-laden, with competent but uninspired acting, going through the action moves.Like many Verhoeven films, a classic.",8,1,2,8 August 2018
Sicario," Everyone uses everyone
","The score of this film consists of threatening hums and rumbles, underscoring the bleakness that pervades Sicario. In an effort to get at a cartel jefe, everyone uses everyone. A Medellín operative uses US agents to get the man who killed his family. US agents use and innocent FBI agent to legitimize a completely illegitimate operation. Everyone uses everyone in some way.The drama (there is no action, except killings after killings to illustrate the depravity of the situation, on all sides, and even those with no side) stays tense throughout the film. No secrets are kept from the viewer as the main characters slowly learn what is really happening, very much in the style of Hitchcock thrillers, where the tension never relied on viewer ignorance beyond any ignorance of the characters.It's a depressing film, but seems only too believable. When the fight for 'good' stoops to the same low level as 'evil,' everything just seems crass and brutish and disgusting. No wonder the heroine is about the only major character a viewer can identify with. She's like a babe in arms thrown to the wolves, as Benicio del Toro remarks towards the end of the film. Strangely, although she cannot kill him, she's the only character with any courage in this film, even though she signs off an affidavit legitimizing the whole affair with a gun at her throat.The film made me mostly just shudder while watching it. If you're inclined to think that most drugs should be legitimized (like alcohol was after the prohibition), this film will do about the best possible to support your view. Cigarettes and alcohol kill a lot of people, but not with as much collateral damage.",8,1,2,14 January 2018
Die Hard," Classic one-liner action
","In the mid-1980s, a transformation of the action movie began. The gritty action dramas of the 70s, of which Gene Hackman vehicles like The French Connection, or at the B-level Charles Bronson's Deathwish were emblematic, gave rise to more cartoonishly violent but breezier fare, enlivened by one-liners and more oblivious to realistic plotting. Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and yes, Bruce Willis led these films. It was the era of the Reagan quip, and while that era has long ended, lesser such films continue to be made.Without a doubt, Die Hard is one of the best of these. Off-duty police officer in skyscraper saves hostages from a suave but brutal master thief. What sets it off from many films in the genre is a loving level of detail. Like a criminal about to steal millions hesitating to steal a pack of M&Ms from a concession stand; or explaining why the hero will run around the whole movie in his undershirt in a logical manner; or having the hero actually hurt badly from walking barefoot on glass; and building up relationships in some detail.It also shares some of the weaker points of the genre, from ludicrously incompetent higher-ups in the police or news business, to the monster villain who is resurrected just when everybody thinks it's over, to bad German accent/grammar coaching of the star villain, played by Alan Rickman. This is particularly disconcerting because his henchmen are all Austrian or German actors who hold flawless conversation.Rickman is a superb villain though, affable and yet coldly brutal, who toys with the good guys by pretending to be anything from a terrorist (he's just a thief) to his own victim. The bad guys can be suave, smart and wear tailored suits.The action is plentiful and well-paced, the one-liners including the famous yippee-kayeh are funny, the actors are doing a great job, and the score is clever, for example in the way it segues from the frolicky Bach music at a Christmas office party to an ominous version of Freude, schöner Götterfunken when the villains appear. It holds up well with time.",7,1,3,1 February 2014
Whiplash," The Agony and the Ecstasy!
","One of the Army's better slogans was 'Be All You Can Be.' Many people incorrectly reinterpret that as 'You can be anything you want.' They think getting a perfect SAT Math score means you have what it takes to be a mathematician; running a 2:20 marathon as a male means you're a top notch runner; getting an A+ in a quantum mechanics course makes you a top flight physicist; or playing 'La Campanella' on the piano fast and without error makes you a great piano player.They are sadly mistaken, as this movie points out. The gap between being 99% and being 99.9999% is vaster than the gap between 50% and 99%. Interestingly, a lot of people who should know better, like the pompous reviewer at The New Yorker who dings 'Whiplash' for technical inaccuracies, don't get it. Whiplash is not a Jazz documentary! It's a film about what it takes to be tops in your field. Being world class at something is a relentless selection process that starts with immense talent, and continues with extreme dedication and a good dose of luck. The food chain whittles down even a superior competitor when the time and place are not right. Again and again, there's only one chance, whether it's the future Nobel Prize winner who squeaked though her faculty interview, or in this movie, a nobody from NYC (our hero is called 'Nieman,' and 'Niemand' with a 'd' in German is nobody) makes it to the top through raw talent, bloody hard work, and a lot of lucky coincidences. The film is unapologetic about what we all know, or should know: a 'good job' does not get you there, it's just the route to mediocrity.The film reminded me a bit of the Michaelangelo tale 'The Agony and the Ecstasy.' That one faced off Charlton Heston against Rex Harrison as Pope Julius. But 'Whiplash' is actually better, a rare find among modern films. The script plays the actors just right, from the young naiveté of Nieman to the relentless perfectionism of J. K. Simmons as the jazz teacher Fletcher, who is searching for that one world-class student so his teaching career is validated. Even in the little details, the movie gets it right: like the arrogance of a New Yorker stating that 'some of the best from NYC, and therefore, the world' are on stage.Along the way, Nieman shows that he is a naïve asshole. He dumps his fledgling girlfriend, anticipating her interference with his hoped-for future greatness. He gets duped by an attorney into accusing Fletcher of abuse, and actually believes that this is going to remain a secret to Fletcher. Talent is often a very narrow thing, and does not mean one has common sense. Picasso (and how many others!) have pointed that out. The climax is very satisfying as the teacher throws the pupil a loop at a live performance, and the pupil, now master, throws it right back at him, until these two birds of a feather give each other a knowing smile.The only thing the film suffers from is a too relentlessly perfect plot, pulling all the right strings in all the right places, like a Ravel orchestration of Mussorgsky. The metaphorical trucks collide on time to cause career-ending whiplash, the metaphorical sheet music vanishes on cue for the inferior artist who actually needs it. It's like a giant clockwork orchestrated to get the maximum effect out of the 1 hour and 45 minutes. And yet, in the middle of the film the director lacks the courage to play the WHOLE of the title song just for once, fading instead into a 'And the winner is...' These are nit-pickings in a great film that's fun to watch, and sends us all a reminder: When we think that 'no matter what you do, someone always does it better, faster, more,' that's true for most of us; but not for everyone.",8,1,4,28 February 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A decent finale
","This film is basically one giant battle, and so Peter Jackson is in his favorite medium, as he was in the grand battles of 'The Two Towers,' and 'The Return of the King.' The Hobbit films have pretty much lost the innocent charm of the book, which is on a much smaller scale than LOTR, but they work OK as a view into the bigger events surrounding Bilbo's quest. As in the previous two installments, the film, although acknowledging Bilbo's feats, minimizes them in favor of more background information hardly mentioned in the books (or not at all, but generally plausible).It's only an OK '6' because the battles and mano-a-mano duels do not tread new ground, the romance falls flat, and because of the many unnecessary CGI indulgences. I think even an audience brought up with video game physics will have to smirk (as many sitting next to me did) when Legolas steps upward on cobblestones in free fall, violating Newton's third law. The slow motion accentuates the poor physics, and indeed, slow-mo fails in many different places in this movie.Tolkien's book just did not have women in it, and the politically correct addition of an elf-dwarf romance fails on many levels: a dwarf had to be turned into a mini-human (with care taken not to show elf and dwarf in ways that allows a height comparison); the freely invented characters are not strong enough to make it work; it is simply corny - again, the audience smirked at the longing gazes and flowing tears.All that said, it's still a good bang for the buck: Cumberbatch's Smaug is suitably ravenous and destructive, the chief of the town gets his due punishment, his opportunistic second hand escapes in drag so that not EVERY evil character gets killed (although probably he'll get offed in the extended edition), Thorin is besotted by the treasure but redeems himself. Some of the invented/misplaced characters work just fine (like the Orc chief and his lieutenant). The battles are great, and heads fly galore.I bought all the LOTR films, seeing them many times and enjoying them as much as I had enjoyed Tolkien's books before. Seeing the Hobbit installments once at the movie theatre was enough. They simply have too much boring baggage added to them to be really great. Jackson should have stayed a little truer to the books by keeping to his original intent of a two-part Hobbit movie. I hope a fan cuts these three behemoths down to about 6 hours, then we'll have a taut, entertaining road trip mini-series. Or someone is just going to have to remake the Hobbit sooner than would otherwise have been necessary.",6,4,8,21 December 2014
Lord of War," Mocumentary?
","This film is rather hard to classify. Is it a black comedy? A pseudo documentary? A war film? A drama that studies a really cold-blooded character who does what he does 'because he does it best?' I finally settled on Mockumentary.Yet Nicholas Cage pulls it off. He is the most cold-blooded SOB one can imagine: the combination to the container filled with weapons to kill thousands is the birth date of his son. In the end, his brother rebels while they deliver arms, after he sees soldiers hack a woman and child to death with machetes. When the soldiers negotiating the arms deal mow Cage's brother down with machine guns, Cage continues negotiating: why get himself killed, too?It's hard to imagine someone like that can exist, but after all, Cage is just a bigger version of the machete-wielders. And according to the film, just poppycocks compared to the presidents of the US, Russia, France etc, who deal in arms and destruction on a yet greater scale.Indeed at the end of the film, just like these leaders of entire countries, Cage is 'too big to fail.' He laughs in the face of the justice department agent who captured him with solid evidence in hand, and wants to put Cage behind bars for good. Cage explains to him with a smile what is really going to happen once he leaves the room, and so it does.At which point we return to Cage as the narrator, full circle with the beginning of the film, except now we get to see what makes the crunching sound under his shoes: millions of bullets, just like the one that we followed from manufacture to the skull of a child in the opening credits.The film certainly preaches, but in a way so absurd, matter-of-fact and darkly comedic that it does not appear heavy-handed, merely unbelievable. And yet we know all too well that the events we see in the film, the useless maiming and killing of millions, happened. And the arms to do the deed did come from somewhere.The film sometimes descends into mocking itself, at other times the pieces fall into place too conveniently, so it remains merely very good. But well worth watching, even if you're not into conspiracy theories.",7,1,2,24 October 2015
Arrival," Whew, are linguists that fast?
","Arrival, not to be confused with the 1996 Sheen vehicle 'The Arrival' (also an SF film) is an honest attempt to rise above the typical SF action film or even SF drama, and it succeeds in many places.My problem is just that, as a physicist and someone who speaks 5 languages (but is NOT a linguist by any means), the middle stretches of this film were vaguely unconvincing. So you'll learn a language in a few weeks (or months?) by scribbling abstract words on a white board? You're not even going to start by pointing at reference objects? And mysteriously, you become fluent in no time to the point where you master supra-temporal perception based on language?Or maybe I'm just old-fashioned a la Shakespeare's 'A rose is a rose by any other name,' and unconvinced that learning a weird new circular language will suddenly make you clairvoyant? Language is powerful, but not that powerful. In the end, words are words, and ink circles are ink circles.The film tries hard to be intellectual, and does not fall far short of it either, so I enjoyed it overall. It's just that I was constantly asking myself 'Really?' and that sort of interfered with my suspense of disbelief, which any great film has to succeed at. It all felt a little bit too forcÃ©. So a generous 6 it is.",6,1,3,6 June 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," Superb Psycho-Thriller
","Director Jonathan Demme and author/screenwriter Harris/Tally are all very talented, but they really outdid themselves here. The more I watch this film, the better it gets. Just the close-up shots of Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) and Clarisse Starling's (Jodie Foster) faces.I recently saw it for the 5th time with my daughter, who saw it for the 1st time. She was on the edge of her seat just as I remember, while I enjoyed the deft plotting, the great characterization, even of side-characters (like the self-absorbed psychiatrist Chilton), who were painted with sparse but knowing strokes.Hopkins and Foster are just perfectly cast, doing the perfect mannerisms, the perfect accents, the perfect everything. The supporting cast is also outstanding, from Starling's boss, who uses her as bait to engage dangerous psychopath Lecter to solve a serial murder case, to the unpleasant psychiatrist Chilton, to the victim held captive in a pit by the serial killer, all the way to the psychopathic serial killer who is sowing himself a female identity out of his victim's skins.The clues abound, and while obvious in hindsight, are subtle enough to be interesting: Southeast Asian moth = criminal is a Vietnam War veteran. Seamstress patterns in closets to reveal where the perpetrator must have learned the sowing trade.Although the gore is very sparse in this film, it is really shocking, and built up just right to cause maximum suspense and 'yech' factor. The director manages to make you wince even when you don't get to see all that much.So why 'only' 9/10? After many viewings, I think more and more that the cutting between Starling and her boss at the end, when he enters the wrong house, is too cheap a trick to show that he ended up tracking the wrong person. Likewise, the 'break into the storage' scene lays on the difficulties with forced entry a bit much. Hitchcock would have stayed away from such low-grade suspense devices. Sometimes less is more. Still, this film is better than a few of the grandmaster's thrillers, and that's saying something coming from a fan who saw his first Hitch while the grandmaster was still filming them!",9,4,8,13 June 2015
Black Panther," Good wishful thinking
","Mythology is all about where you wish you had come from. This film certainly delivers on that wish. I am not an automatic fan of Marvel Universe films, but this one was pretty good: not as lackluster and episodic as the first Guardians of the Galaxy (the 2nd was better), not as good as the original Ironman, from which it steals aplenty.The greatest irony in this film is the idea that the achievements of Western-Asian technology, just upped a bit due to vibranium-better-than-steel, really should be what comes Out of Africa. Unfortunately the film forsakes the true beauty of Africa in favor of CGI skyscraper towns and dragonfly-styled aircraft. Except for one scene with ancestral panthers in a tree.Still, as an action-driven superhero movie, it's pretty good. Some of the chase and war scenes are overly long. (The fight/car chase in the middle and final battle both start out promising, but just keep on giving and giving...) On the other hand there is reasonable character development, be it the villain cousin, the King, his warrior, priest, would be-wife, or sister. Poor Andy Serkis does not get much development though, so one can guess that he won't last all too long into this film. I know some people are not going to like the accents, but I've heard many native speakers from countries like Kenya or Zimbabwe, and the accent here is really a nice blend that evokes speakers of African languages speaking English. Probably a lot of US moviegoers have not heard many Africans, so this might seem a bit weird to them. The film probably on the slow side for current superhero moviegoers, but for someone raised in the 70s, who thinks the original Star Wars is very fast-paced, it's just right. One thing the film does well, given the irony at its central core, is to walk the fine line between glorifying either technology or ghetto, and point to what all humans surely could do to make this a better world.There are some plot holes, but even many of those serve the symbolism of the movie: Why leave the child behind in the ghetto without a father? Well, this is how it turns out for many young African-Americans, they don't go to Wakanda in reality. Others are just part of the comic book lore from which the film descends: such as how to keep an advanced civilization cloaked and completely unknown throughout history.I was torn between 6 and 7, but looked at my ratings for a number of '6' and '7' films, and for now at least decided that it was closer to 6. But a strong 6.",6,0,1,14 September 2018
Toy Story 3," Pixar can do well even with sequels
","Usually sequels, especially of children's animated films, fall pretty flat by the third time. Not this one. Pixar's director gives the audience a feeling that the same loving effort in writing and production was invested in number three as in number one.The plot does not cover much new ground: toys are thrust into a dangerous new environment, don't stick together at first leading to their near-demise, then finally recognize the strength in unity. However, the script is well crafted. I watched the 'adult' film Oblivion the day before TS3, and the former proves that Hollywood is willing to patronize its adult audience with more inconsistent plotting than its child audiences.The evil mastermind is a teddy bear that smells of strawberries. Pure genius, and he has a good evil mastermind backstory to go with it. As a big plus point in script writing, teddy is not reformed at the end, showing that not all bad people can be reformed, and suffers a suitable terrible fate, but without any violence, indeed a fate driven by a truck driver's LOVE for the bad toy. Pure genius.I have to confess the director managed to get a lump in my throat by the time the toys say goodbye to their long time owner Andy who is off to college. Perhaps it is because I watched TS1 with my kids when they were little, and now they are off to college. Whatever the reason, and yes, they are playing with your emotions 'the easy way' in this film, nonetheless I can count the animated films that put a lump in my throat easily on the fingers of one hand.",7,0,1,24 December 2013
Lucy," Not up to Besson's high standards
","Luc Besson is one of our modern auteurs, with films like Leon, The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita, or Taken. In the Lucy tale, an innocent woman is captured by drug lords who stash a developmental hormone drug in her belly to smuggle it into Europe. Then they make the mistake of kicking her and releasing the drug into her. She turns into a superhuman who can use much more of her brainpower than you or I, and initially kills the drug lords like flies, but then realizes she has a bigger mission.Lucy has an interesting premise: what if the human mind is somehow capable of much more, including telekinesis, levitation, and all those things we occasionally dream we could do. The film posits that current science of the brain is not even scratching the surface, and consciousness can control matter. Fine.The problem is that it portrays current science incorrectly at a level that will make any educated high school student cringe. Nothing is wrong with the premise of the film, but if something transcends our current knowledge, at least present current knowledge as we know it correctly at the high school level. (1) Life arose well over a billion years ago. (2) The 10% brain thing is pop psychology of the 1950s. It's 2014, Luc! Etc. And if high school students will giggle (like the ones who sat next to me in the theatre), imagine someone who knows a bit about the current state-of-the-art in neuroscience!Moral: If you're going to use bad science, as opposed to extrapolate good science, at least don't flash a %-value on the screen every 10 minutes as a reminder !La Femme Nikita is just a much better film in the same genre: a woman turned into a deadly weapon that goes out of the control of her handlers. Lucy is a return to familiar fare for Besson, but he got it right the first time around, and ultimately fails here. If mathematics does not describe the secrets of the universe, how come you can summarize Lucy's important knowledge on a USB memory stick? That's a math-based device.The film features many interesting ideas and shots, like the cutting between Lucy/druglords and a gazelle/cheetah; or the scene about cell division, sex and birth, although the religious crowd will not like the interposition of animal and human behavior. And of course there is the Lucy that started it all in East Africa, whom modern Lucy gets to meet once she controls time. For these and other good ideas, the film still gets a 6. But for the lame science (spewed with laughable authority by Morgan Freeman), lame dinosaur action, stupid plot holes that don't belong in a film with high aspirations, and the 'Lucy is the Matrix' ending, that's as high as it goes. I recommend seeing La Femme Nikita again instead.",6,0,2,3 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Strong reboot
","Star Wars VII is a strong reboot of the series. Once the fan hype settles, it will be recognized for what it is: derivative of the original, but well made. That puts it above Episodes I and III, at par with II and VI, but not up to IV and V. A nice 7/10.Unfortunately, the film can't do for today's generation of teen SF fans what the original did for me when I saw its premiere in Austria in 1977. Back then, the whole concept of a realistic SF space opera, with grungy corners in space ships, realistic special effects, and planet-size super weapons was brand new. In today's special effects world, it is all old hat.Still, all the things that Abrams did wrong to mess up Star Trek and the Federation Universe, he did right in the Galaxy a Long Time Ago, Far, Far Away... The new characters are strong and likable. The story takes Star Wars away from political intrigue back to its Space Opera days. Many of the special effects are physical, and return this film to its roots. That beast lumbering around for 2 seconds of screen time on Jakku, so clearly a big guy in costume, put a smile on my face. It may be a costume, but it still feels more real than Andy Serkis' Snoke. The CGI effects are also generally more physically realistic than in other modern SF films.The film ends on a personal note between Rey and her uncle and future trainer, rather than the big planet-size battle station getting blown up. There is symmetry with episode VI when son kills father instead of father trying to kill son. The new characters are given room to develop and carry the story in other ways, while familiar faces push the nostalgia buttons in just the right way. BB-8 carries on R2's torch well.Yet Episode VII is very derivative of the original, so much so that it can't really rise above 7/10: an even bigger death star, complete with X-wings to fly into its trench; Rey ('you will open the releases, and leave the door open') and Max von Sydow channeling Alec Guiness in words or appearance; Tattooi... I mean Jakku, the desert planet, on which a little robot with an important secret message for the alliance is marooned; a death star interior with some rock walls, but otherwise as Grand Moff Tarkin would recognize it, down to the hatch where Vader and Kenobi fought their final duel; a Yoda-like ancient female; a sleazy tavern a la IV; the Millennium Falcon not working except for the holographic chess game; the list goes on and on. One can hope that Episode VIII will strike fresher ground, now that a solid bridge has been built.",7,4,15,20 December 2015
RED," Breezy action
","This movie is in the best tradition of the breezy action flick. The locales don't rise to the level of the best Bond, the quips and villains are far from the standard set by Die Hard, but nonetheless, it is jolly good fun to watch.What distinguishes it from many similar films is a competent ensemble cast of A-list actors, and some good ideas on how to use them. For example, Morgan Freeman has a cameo as an 80 year-old terminal cancer patient who dies willingly for his friends as the ultimate deus ex machina. John Malkovich gets some good laughs as the conspiracy theorist armed to the teeth: all of his conspiracies come true.What it shares with similar films is a predictable and improbable concoction of a plot that pits Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis as retired CIA agents against the Vice President of the US (or really, the corrupt industrialist behind the VP). For starters, the Bad Guy could just have stopped after killing a reporter who dug up too much dirt. If he had not started offing the Good Guys, none of them would ever have noticed anything is amiss - end of movie. Then there are the usual situations where a cut to the next scene gets the characters out of impossible situations, the people with dislocated/shot shoulders who fight on like nothing happened, agents with handguns who don't die in a spray of heavy machine gun fire, etc.But these nit-pickings are really irrelevant in such a film. The story breezes along with fewer dull moments as it progresses, the acting is solid as expected from a cast of this caliber. There are nice touches like the animated postcard transitions between locations. And just when you worry that the writers are setting up a lame sequel in Moldova, they deconstruct that idea by reducing it to silliness. A well crafted show good for an entertaining single viewing. If you want plot consistency, go watch a film by Ingmar Bergman or Alfred Hitchcock.",6,1,1,18 January 2014
Flight," Solid drama
","This film reminds me of solid 1980s TV dramas: the decent man with a drinking problem who saves the day, but whose problem comes to haunt him. The estranged wife and son, the girlfriend who abandons him because he won't quit, the people who manipulate him, the guilt that flares up intermittently and then comes to roost at the bitter end.Denzel Washington pulls it off well as Whip the alcoholic pilot, and singlehandedly holds the film together through the FAA investigation following a plane crash caused by an 'Act of God', during which Whip, even drunk, saves most souls on board through skilled piloting.On the downside, the film shares the easy symbolism and predictability of solid TV movies. Speaking of 'souls' and 'Acts of God,' there is a lot of religious symbolism (from a born-again co-pilot to a clipped church tower during the crash), but it fails to provide depth. It's clear at every moment where this one is going to steer, although at least the pilot union man made sure there are only soft drinks in the fridge in Whip's hotel room the night before the big hearing; but of course fate has the door to the adjoining empty guest room unlocked. An FAA hearing brings epiphany, and a sit-down with Whip's estranged son a certain closure.The R rating is well deserved with all the nudity, drugs and booze, yet the film almost has the flavor of a family movie. In fact, if it were edited for network TV like the old days to remove 'questionable material' as they used to call it, it would fit right in. Tight editing from 130 minutes down to 95 would have brought this up by one star, and make it fit into 2 hours with the commercials added.",6,0,0,2 January 2014
Unbroken," Competent WW II survival 'true story'
","What do you get when the Coen brothers write the script and Angelina Jolie directs? At a minimum a solidly done film of survival against all odds during WW II. The plot ranges from floating for months in a raft after an aircraft engine failure, to prisoner of war camps in Japan, and finally within a hair's breath of execution just as US planes fly over, with a happy 'kiss the American soil and meet the family again' ending.I can't give it less than 7 because the cinematography is nice, the effects serve the story and not the other way around, the script is solid, and so is the directing and acting by a bunch of newcomers. We can forgive embellishments like nicely trimmed-looking beards after feeding on raw shark for 45 days in a raft - at least the two survivors looked emaciated. To enjoy what this film has to offer, we must also forgive the somewhat routine directing and acting, as well as the competent but not extraordinary score, although this film could have used Howard Shore in Lord-of-the-Rings form to shore up its emotions a bit.Still, I am much more forgiving when a film under-hams than when it over-hams, and this film treats all its subjects fairly laconically, even the Japanese camp commander with an inferiority complex, and certainly our Olympic runner hero-turned-prisoner of war. It's also a nice touch how major characters come and suddenly go, as tends to be the case in real life where people get separated against their hopes and expectations. It's not surprising that no Oscars were forthcoming, but I think this film will be better liked than most of the overly sappy Hollywood fare in this genre as time goes on, hence my 7/10.In my opinion, it's definitely worth a rental, and will keep most viewers interested in the characters and story, even though we know in advance how this true story is going to end. I enjoyed it during a 2 hour, 16 minute session on my exercise bike, and it certainly kept me happily pedaling away.",7,0,0,11 October 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great finale, why not make four?
","Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of 'Heavenly Creatures' and 'Dead Alive' did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the first film. I must say I was mesmerized from Kate Blanchett's opening narration to the end, when Frodo sails into the West and Sam returns to his Goldilocks.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's 'By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)' - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a '10'). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade.",8,0,1,13 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," THE space opera
","What 2001 did a few years earlier for serious sf films, Star Wars did in spades for the genre of space opera. I remember sitting in the theater in 1977, glued to the screen, wishing it would never end.Star Wars was a transition for the genre, the first such film that required no, or at least very little, suspense of disbelief. I am not referring to perfection of the plot here, but to immersion in a world sufficiently well simulated to seem real. There are gigantic rusty tanks run by desert creatures peddling junk; dark oily corners in space ships that have seen better days; elevators going into an abyss in gigantic space docks; robots with dings in their exoskeleton; and evil storm troopers that in contrast are white, and shiny, and new.As became clear with the later films, Lucas is not the best director or scriptwriter, and given too much money, he over-gadgeteers every shot. But on a budget, and gathering together his best material, he put an awesome vision to the screen. He had a vision of a world, expanding over the years, within reach of other sublime universes such as Tolkien's Middle Earth or Gene Roddenberry's Federation Universe.Lucas pushed the envelope of hard sf realism as it had been pushed before only once. No surprise that he created venues such as Industrial Light and Magic, or Skywalker Sound, as the technological side of movie-making and the vision of the general universe were is greatest strengths. Much bedeviled and much emulated (by WETA et al.) over the years, the photorealistic special effects movie and the special effects houses that make them are much indebted to him. Mark Hamill once said, to paraphrase, if someone could shoot films without actors, Lucas would be the man. Unfortunately, this prophecy has come too close to the truth in modern action/effects movies, including Lucas' own subsequent second trilogy. But eventually things will settle in, and special effects will be so ordinary that they can be used continuously without becoming the centerpiece of the film. One of the more embarrassing moments of my life was watching Space Balls on an airplane, and bursting into frenetic laughter about a minute into its opening special effects scene, until I realized that the whole plane was looking at me in that mixture of engine rumble and total silence you can only get on a night flight. The scene was not about special effects. It was just silly funny. We need more of that.The story of Star Wars is endearing: a young farmhand is recruited by an ancient knight to save a princess in distress from a dark lord who can destroy entire planets to bend the galaxy to his will. The rebels whom the princess represents eventually manage to destroy a gigantic battle planetoid through a clever attack, assisted by a mercenary with a heart and a pair of bumbling robots. Unlike many modern action movies, this one takes some time to develop its characters, especially the pair C3PO and R2D2. So what if the idea is derivative of Kurosawa, and John William's fantastic music of Dvorjak! Dvorjak also copied a thematic opening of his best symphony from Beethoven's 9th, Scherzo, for 6 full emblematic notes. If you're gonna steal, steal from the best! And many have since taken this to heart by stealing from Star Wars.The film remains great in its remastered version, except now Lucas' heavier hand of later years can be seen: Mos Eisley is virtually tumbling with creatures put there to fill the screen with effects. It took until LOTR a few years later for effects to develop to the point where they are just present, not overwhelming. But Lucas had already achieved that ultimate goal with much less money and just as much heart in 1977.",8,1,1,16 March 2014
Ran," Lady Kaede rules
","I rarely give a film a 10. Not my favorite Hitchock. Not my favorite Gilliam. Not my favorite LOTR. They all have to live with a 9. RAN is a 10. I come back to this film every few years, and each time it impresses me more. LOTR may have bested it for grand battles, but such are only a means, not an end, in RAN.Superficially, RAN is a King Lear story about a Japanese warlord who abdicates his throne and is betrayed by his elder sons after sending his true youngest son into exile. His dream to visit each son in turn and stay over a few days at the 'in-law addition' to the family castles is thwarted when his sons want to usurp every last bit of his power and the whole clan goes down in war.In reality, RAN is about female power. And manipulation. Power manipulation. Sexual manipulation. Manipulation for revenge. The Supreme Manipulator is Lady Kaede. The battles are just her chess games. The sons are just numbers - literally, their names mean 'First,' 'Second,' and 'Third'-born. The fate of Hidetora Ichimonji, our King Lear, is not sealed when he trusts his elder sons and sends his true youngest son into exile at the beginning of the film. It was sealed long before the film started, when he massacred Lady Kaede's family in front of her eyes, and then forced the unspeakable on her: marrying her to his eldest son as a spoil of war. Little did he understand how much more cunning than he she is. How much more patient. How much more manipulative. Seemingly peaceful years pass with Hidetora watching his kingdom prosper, but the tree has already been severed at the roots.When Lady Kaede is finally beheaded at the end of the film, it is too late. Lady Kaede's most dangerous body part is gone: the brain that plots, the mouth that whispers destruction into her husbands ears. Her plans have already come to full fruition, and the destruction of her family is avenged by the complete destruction of Hidetora's. Who is to say that she is more evil than Hidetora or his sons? Has she done more unto them than Hidetora did to her? Did she ever wield anything but her tongue, while powerless men kill and rampage with their swords?RAN is surely Kurosawa's greatest opus, and his last. The Twelve Samurai and the Hidden Fortress are fine films, but ultimately just sophisticated action films. RAN is a film of color, of symbolism that is powerful but never in-your-face, of emancipation, and of revenge served oh so very cold.",10,0,2,28 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," As good as a 'middle' can be!
","Many people think that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the original three, but I still vote the original higher. Still, for a film without a real beginning, middle, or end, this one is darn good.Frank Oz' puppetry really reached an apex in the early 1980s, with films like 'Dark Crystal' and 'Empire.' No wonder Yoda made the cover of Time magazine (as Star Wars did several times). The original Yoda is much more whimsical and playful than the 'earlier' Yoda of Episodes I-III. He toys with Luke while dispensing vaguely Confucian wisdom. The facial articulation is very good, and there is a certain palpable reality in physical special effects and good puppetry that the later digital Yoda just did not quite reach; besides the fact that Oz was obviously instructed by Lucas to keep it more serious.Then there is the Oedipal turn the story takes: 'Luke, I am your father.' I was actually surprised in 1980 when I saw this, and over the years I have gone from judging it corny to a masterstroke. It's probably both. For those who saw Star Wars pre-1980, it's clear that this was not the original plan. Interestingly, George Lucas has done some cleaning up of older movies to conform to the later canon (all but cutting a Luke-Leia kiss in the original that was just not quite brotherly-sisterly enough), but left a lot of it alone, like Obi Wan providing minimal explanation for his 'subterfuge' in the original Star Wars movie. Like in a good Charles Dickens novel, everyone turns out to be related to everyone or have met the person who did the thing who helped the other who...Other than Yoda and that revelation, the story that takes Luke from ice planet Hoth to be trained by Yoda and finally confront his Dark Side in the form of his father for the first time, does not have too many exciting turns or characters. Calrissian was planted in it for political correctness as a Han Solo scoundrel duplicate (I'm grateful though because Billie Dee was a pretty good scoundrel). Han literally gets frozen while Lando takes over for a while, as though there's not room for two of them.Still, I have to give it an 8. It is skillfully crafted for a middle piece, and Lucas really honed his special effects magic some more since the first installment. It's as enjoyable to see now as in the 80s, and its lower density special effects are almost prophetic of what is to come again: special effects that serve the film, not the other way around.",8,0,0,18 March 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Surprisingly good second installment
","The Bourne Identity was a refreshingly good spy thriller. Nothing like a man, who doesn't even know who he is, being hunted.In the second installment, Bourne (Matt Damon) finally gets to know his real name, but it's a small consolation for having his girlfriend killed when he's the one to be assassinated. The plot is a pretty good concoction. Bourne has retired to India, but he is rudely awakened out of that 10 year illusion of safety when a Russian operative tries to kill him. It's part of a plot to pin on him the disappearance of a case file and a lot of cash: no better stooge than a dead man with a past connection to the case. Two CIA agents are on his trail, one clean, one dirty (from the first installment), as said case file and cash have a bad history. To Bourne, locations in Berlin look just too awfully familiar, and he finally remembers what he did there on his first job, and why the dirty CIA man wants him dead. It's a cat-and-mouse game like the first one, with Bourne always barely a step ahead of the CIA agents trying to catch him. One agent wants Bourne alive, the other dead so he can retire instead of having to commit suicide. Well, guess how it comes out.There are the usual plot holes, such as Bourne running around and car-chasing with a bullet having gone through his shoulder, and mysteriously escaping Russia to get back to NY. Anyone who's ever broken bones in the shoulder knows that no matter the adrenaline, that's not how it works. It was also illogical for the dirty CIA man to kill an underling who's coming up with potentially incriminating information. It is even more incriminating, and his only real option is to just get Bourne killed as quickly as possible. The dirty agent pays for this very stupid mistake with suicide. There are other plot holes, but none really critical, so this remains fun to watch.Few films that are very good in the first place have even better sequels (maybe Star wars IV or Terminator?). 'Bourne Identity' is no exception, but it had a sequel just about as good as the first, and 'Bourne Supremacy' is still a welcome change from a lot of action spy movies these days. Some may find the 'immersed in the action' camera work a bit annoying during chases, as the camera bangs into people and jostles around with Bourne and his pursuers. That and some plot holes and the 'more of the same' effect of any sequel is about the only bad thing I can say about this neat thriller.",7,1,2,1 November 2015
