Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The critics were wrong!
","This movie was really cool! Granted, the first 30 minutes or so did have some problems with pacing; for instance, we're never introduced to Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, but once the movie got started it was awesome! Jar-Jar did not annoy me, everyone did a great job. It doesn't surpass Empire, but it's on par with the original and better than ROTJ. I can't wait for 2 and 3!",9,0,0,19 May 1999
