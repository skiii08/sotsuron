Angels & Demons," Much better delivery than Da Vinci Code, worth a watch
","After the disappointing Da Vinci Code film. (I'm a fan of both Angels&Demons and Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown), my expectations were already low but not surprised this film was better than the first. Even though Angels&Demons was published years before Da Vinci Code. Go figure? This film delivers well as the book was written in a fashion that reads like a international action thriller touching on the intellectual and spiritual.The film takes off with the development in sciences that would have significance in proving the big bang theory but a crime is committed and a sample of the proof is stolen from a large lab in Europe. As the story progresses, they realize there may be a tie to a group who claim to be the Illuminati and who are seeking to bring down the Catholic church with the truth of science. This somehow involves deeply delving into the history of the Catholic church, it's security concerns, hidden treasures and the bits of truth that may be stored away that they don't want the public to be aware of.From there, the film just gets thicker and faster. Ewan McGregor does a great job and is a refreshing face in the film along with some other good names that round out the cast, unlike Da Vinci Code which had only one mode to the film. Angels&Demons is much more watchable and theatrical. The performances are much better because the book has many bigger than life characters and events. It followed the book better as in the way it didn't water down the controversy and graphic details. The Angels&Demons film is definitely worth a watch and will wash out any of the bad taste left from Da Vinci Code.",8,1,3,16 May 2009
The Prestige," Expected to see a magic movie and I was blown away...
","I went into this movie and for the first quarter of the movie, it was near my expectation, then the story and where the characters go with their intentions and plans just totally blew me away. Great effects, great acting and a wonderful story that is about magic but also about the magic of science in the early years of the industrial revolution.I don't want to provide any spoilers so I will say, this movie may come off as weird to some and genius to others, but all in all it was well told, well executed and the production is very good. Some of the ideas, notions and magic of science in this film. Top notch acting, great mixture of characters. You will like this movie if you liked movies similar to Requiem for a Dream, The Illusionist, Donnie Darko, The Fountain, and film in the like.",9,2,3,13 April 2007
Gran Torino," An American classic film genre revived by Eastwood
","I luckily saw this film and it is a great film, opening up the dialog between changing times, cultures and just doing the right thing. Clint Eastwood brings his charismatic charms as the rough neck American who had served in the Korean War, where it seems some psychological trauma still haunts him. After the war he is leading what seemed to be a good life, having two sons and taking care of his Gran Torino. However, it is the typical, mid-western attitude that grows into a more understanding that everyone is human, which brings the film up a level.As Eastwood's character begins to see his age is beginning to take on a final run on him, he discovers his pals and old neighbors are no longer. The neighborhood is not what it used to be, his kids are not what he had imagined they would be and most of all... he is bitter and battered... something the Korean War scarred him with. And now his neighborhood now being populated by the Hmong/Mong people of asia (near cambodia and Vietnam).Through a series of events, the story also takes place around his neighbor's young boy who is a good kid, too young to be bad. But is cornered by a gang into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino. The Hmong family finds out what happened and also see that Walt helped the young boy when the gang came up to take him. This opens up communication between the two neighbors... in his own way, Walt grows a little, heals a little and becomes bonded with some of his Hmong neighbors who keep bringing him food and gifts (Hmong tradition) for his good deeds to his neighbors. At first, he is confused and resistant, but eventually warms up a bit. It is touching, great character development and acting on Eastwood's part. Using no name actors brought authenticity to the film, it became that much more believable and down to earth.However, as one grows fond and attached to the characters, the greatest deed is done at the end by Walt, in what seemingly may be his way of forgiving himself for the horrible things he did in the Korean War. I really liked the film, Eastwood is one of my favorites and I thought lately thing were drying up for him, but this revived his renaissance. I would recommend this film to anyone for a good drama.",8,1,3,31 December 2008
The Da Vinci Code," A critique of the book vs. the film lacked delivery and effectiveness
","This is a critique not a synopsis. I'm a huge fan of the books and of course I will be critical of the delivery on film, but this movie made the book seem bad. Which is not the case, the book is superb and delivered badly on film.I've read both Dan Brown's books Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code a number of years ago. Upon reading both books, I remember thinking Angels&Demons was much better suited for the big screen before Da Vinci Code. The theatricals were all built into the story... but anyways, I digress...The book The Da Vinci Code is very very good. It is intelligent enough to form questions, action packed to keep moving, filled with crime, mystery, international intrigue taking place around the famous landmarks and locations around Europe. The story involves a colorful array of characters and is in fact set as an International thriller. The book inquires and stimulates the mind and spirit as the reader follows Robert Langdon's quest for truth. This is really the universal tender that makes the book so good.The film, directed by Ron Howard. Starring Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon follows the book chapter by chapter, step by step in its execution. To those who read the book, the movie is not bad. Unfortunately, even liking the book, the film becomes tedious and confusing. I found it annoying that they felt they had to over intellectualize the significance of every symbol and pattern in the film. The film is too politically correct when the book was not and challenged what is known as the truth and not a story created by the powers that be.The film had plenty of funding, plenty of time and some of the most talented to make a really good book into an really good movie but what we got was overly delivered and had little significance. That's my one criticism, it's the one biggest complaint that viewers had who never read the book. They had no idea what was going on and was even more confused at the end. I guess to say in a nice way, the book was so good, it made the film didn't seem as good. But that is not the case with the Angels&Demons.",5,0,3,16 May 2009
The Fountain," amazingly human story with a dreamy vision
","It's been a while since I've watched a film as poignant as The Fountain (2006). The story is well told, liberal in artistic representation and beautifully portrays the human condition. The story makes the viewer feel and experience the main character's plight.One becomes intertwined with the main character as the story forms around him in artistic scenery, beautifully absurd moments of reflection and a moving montage of characters. Highly recommended viewing... especially if you like films like Requiem to a Dream, Donnie Darko, Children of Men, Trainspotting, The Illusionist and films in the like.",9,0,0,13 April 2007
30 Days of Night," new and fresh horror thriller, good acting and good plot...
","I read the reviews here and kind of went into the movie with lower expectations that everyone has been praising it, but to put it in a objective way... this movie is a good horror thriller. I gave it a 7 out of 10 for fulfilling 3 very strong areas that make the movie. There however a couple weak points, as I've seen others who reviewed the movie reflected on.1. The acting is good, well crafted and characters are believable, but there are moments that seem to help take the suspense out of some of the moments. (such as when they arrest The Stranger (another nice performance by Ben Foster) from the beginning of the movie at the diner where Melissa George and Josh Hartnett have an absurd moment that just seemed odd and out of place for the situation).2. Original plot and story. The setting is very original, the story line and plot devices are nice and original. This is even more enforced by the acting and pretty suspenseful story telling. (such as when you hear Ellen's voice screaming over the radio, after their first encounter with the vampires).3. Action and effects are well done. Lots of good blood and effects, as well as real action. Some are short and sweet but enough to keep things interesting and are important to keeping the story and plot moving forward.The weak points of the movie are pretty minor because the humans are really what the movie is about, I say this because of the vampires characters were pretty bland and not very interesting. They were more like zombies and vampires mixed together. A little played out already.",7,0,1,7 February 2008
The Wrestler," Excellent film, everyday movie goer. It's touching story in a brutally honest world.
","If I hadn't seen the votes and the list of talent in this film, I might not even have given it a second thought, however it turned out to be an hour or so of fascination with the characters and the stories of their lives. The story surrounds a man's career choice as a professional wrestler, party animal and self interested life style that affects his personal relationship, his physical health and most importantly his daughter. He chose his work before family only to have 'life' catch up with him in a matter of days with a major heart attack. Still living a trailer trash life, the wrestler realizes he has no one close to him and attempts to reach out after the doctor's recommendation is to stop wrestling all together. So the touching story of a big tough man who becomes emotionally brittle after this life event.Rourke and Tomei team up in this film, both still looking great and they possess the down to earth male and female touch that the film emphasizes even though they live two very similar lives. Emotionally backwards and living with major issues. Somehow the wrestler reaches out and clutters his way into the lives of two women, his estranged daughter and a dancer he likes. The clincher to the film is the wrap up at the end. It is passionate, emotional and painful, but it so satisfying. One can't help but hope and fight for the characters as they suffer through their emotions.",8,4,5,30 December 2008
1408," One of the best psychological horror films since Poltergeist.
","First time I saw this film, I was floored. I haven't been scared like this since I watched Poltergeist as a 9 year old. Good plot, good premise and very very scary scenes. One Stephen King's best movies. I was scared enough that I didn't want to watch the film again right away.Essentially, John Cusack is a ghost hunter/writer who stays at haunted places and writes about them in his books. He is a skeptic, reeling from the death of his young daughter and has never recovered. A drinker, a skeptic and lost he is mysteriously lured to room 1408 where not only does his deepest, saddest fears haunt him, but the horrible history of the room surrounds him. Samuel L Jackson also plays the role of the concierge well.The film also has two endings, the first one I saw I loved. The extended director's cut ending failed for me, you will have to decide for yourself.",9,0,0,11 October 2007
