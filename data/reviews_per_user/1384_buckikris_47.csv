At first, Scottie passes on the job, but then decides to accept the case.The next day, Scottie follows Madeline from a mission cemetery to an art gallery. Here she sets a stare at her beautiful relative in a portrait; The Portrait of Carlotta. Scottie follows her from the hotel she is staying to various other places around San Francisco watching her, her behavior, E.T.C.. She goes to a swank flower shop and purchases a bouquet of pink roses. Then she drives to San Francisco Bay. Scottie notices how she slowly moves to the bottom, then starts throwing in the roses.

When he calls Galvin she flies the coup. As the movie progresses he develops a relationship with her. One night Mitch drives up; and sees Madeline come out of his apartment. She is upset and leaves, latter she paints a portrait of her as Carlotta to get even. It's cruel, and it costs her a movie date with her friend.Scottie continue's the case, and Madeline tells him about the dream she keeps having. A Spanish mission that she believes is a calling from Carlotta. Scottie describes the place and tells her it's the San Juan Batista. It's 90 miles south of San Francisco. He calms her down and tells her they will travel there tomorrow.
They travel there, and everything she described is there. When they get close to the Spanish mission tower, Madeline has a request. She wants to go up to the tower alone. When she quickly runs into the tower, Scottie goes after her. He only gets so far up to the tower his Acrophobia strikes. All of a sudden we see Madeline fall from the top and killing herself. After this happens an inquest is done; but no crime is committed.One night Scottie has a nightmare where he sees Madeline fail over and over, and he is unable to help her. This dream was so severe that it causes him to have a breakdown. This sends him to a Psychiatric hospital, where he is completely detached . The one who has been by his side the whole time is Mitch. Mitch talks to the doctor about his prognosis. The doctor explains he could be there for 6 mths. to a year.A year passes and Scottie has been release. He she's a car that used to belong to Madeline and asks the lady where she got it. She explain a Galvin Elster sold it to her. He is obsessed He notices a woman Judy Barton who looks like Madeline except for the hair. He follows her to her room at a hotel, asks her a few questions. They start a relationship where he molds her to look exactly like Madeleine; the same hair, clothes, everything. She doesn't like it, but goes along with it to keep him happy. The relationship grows, and one night he finds out who she really is because of the old fashioned neckless. He is upset, so he decides before dinner to teach her a lesson.He travels back to San Juan Batista where it all happened. This is when Judy/Madeline knows he found out who she is. When they reach the top of the bell tower, she explains what happened. She is an actress hired by Gavin to pose as his wife; because she looked so much like her. He was planning on killing his wife, and needed the perfect double. Galvin new if he hired you to follow me he could pull it off, because of the Vertigo. Gavin got away with murder and Judy was given money and the neckless, which gave her I.D. away at the end. When they were both arguing a nun comes up to the tower because of the commotion. It startles Judy that she loses her balance and falls to her death.In conclusion, this is one of Hitchcock's best movies. It shows the darker side of married life; and the length they will go to get rid of their spouse. Sometime I wonder why not just get a divorce, but some people will always choose the quicker path. I recommend this hit to everyone, and if marriage dosen't work the second time, give up. Remember there is no such this as the perfect crime.",10,7,9,21 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ' Now This Is Pod Racing'
","When I was younger I would tell others, I wish there were more Star Wars films. In 1999 my wish came true when Lucas decided to create The Phantom Menace, The first of the 3 pre-quels. This film is action packed; and superb acting from veteran actors Neeson, MacGregor, and Mc Diarmid. In my opinion too much CGI can ruin films, but it's cheaper and cost efficient.
The Phantom Menace begins when Supreme Chancellor Valorium ( Terrance Stamp) sends two Jedi Qui-Gon Gen( Liam Neeson), and His apprentice, Obi-Wan-Kenobi ( Ewan Mac Gregor), to negotiate with the Trade Federation. When the negotiations fail, because Darth Sidious ( Ian Mc Diarmid) tells Viceroy Gunray to eliminate the Jedi.
When the Jedi escape they flee to the planet Naboo. Once there they are caught in the middle of a ground invasion. It's a droid army invasion ordered by Darth Sidious. When Qui-Gon is escaping he saves a local Gun-Gun. Gun-Gun's also live on Naboo, but are considered 2nd class by the Nebuians. Qui-Gon ask Jar Jar( Amehd Best) to be taken to see the leader of the Gun-Gun's. Jar Jar Binks is strange, and was banished because of his clumsiness. The three go to the secret underworld city, where Qui-Gon talks to Boss Nass, the Gun-Gun leader. There he realizes that Jar-Jar is to be axed, but Qui-Gon explains that Binks owes him a life-debt. Boss Nass is lets Jar jar go with the 2 Jedi and provides them transportation through the planets core. Jar Jar navigates them, to the top of Naboo. Once they arrive they rescue Queen Padme Amidala ( Natalie Portman), who is leader of Naboo. She is watching her people suffer, and is being pressured to sign a treaty against her will. Once the Jedi find the queen, she flees with the Jedi in her Nubian Star Ship. When returning back to Coruscant the ship gets damaged.The Hyperdrive is destroyed and they have to find a safe place to land. The closest planet and one that no one will find them is Tattooine. Once there Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, R2-D2, and Padme who dresses as one of her handmaidens investigate the planet. They arrive in Mos Espa- Trying to get parts for their ship.
In a junk shop they meet Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd) who works there. Is boss is Watto, Anakin is a slave who lives with his mom (Permilia August). Anakin is very gifted he loves to build things(Protocol Droid -C-3PO) and has very quick reflexes. In fact he catches Qui-Gon eyes with his metaclorian count, plus he tells Qui-Gon he built a pod-racer. If he wins he will help pay for the repairs to their ship. Darth Sidious is still trying to locate Queen Amadalia so he explains to the viceroy his apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park) will find them; and force her to sign the treaty.
When Anakin wins the pod-race, he is freed and begins his journey with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. They return to Corusant were Anakin is to be tested to become a Jedi. The Council finds conflict within the boy and says no. Qui-Gon is determined to get his way by training Anakin as a Jedi. The council reminds him that the code forbid the taking of 2 apprentices. Qui-Gon tells Anakin 2 watch him. In the meantime Senator Palpatine ( Ian McDiarmid) calls for a vote of No-Confidence in Chancellor Vallorm . This will temporally put Palpatine in charge until the election.When Padme returns to Naboo, she revels her true identity surprising all as the Queen. There she begs the GunGun's for help in ending the invasion. The battle continues and Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon come face to face with Darth Maul. A Light-saber duel ensues between the three, and Qui-Gon is killed. In the end peace is declared. Yoda grants Obi-wan the right to take on Anakin as his apprentice, and Senator Palpatine becomes Chancellor. The Chancellor then holds great interest in watching Anakin's progress as an apprentice",8,1,3,26 February 2018

Raiders of the Lost Ark," It's Not The Years It's The Mileage And This One Goes The Distance.
","This is one of the best Indiana Jones Films ever, I remember seeing it for the first time when I was like 9 and loved it. The snakes were an added touch, and the story was excellent. I have seen them all and I would have to say this is probably the best one of them all. The story is about Professor Henry Indiana Jones, an Acchelogist who has just come back from South America on an expedition. He is asked to go on a special assignment in search for The Lost Ark of The Covenant. Once in Cairo he meets Belloq a competitor who all seems to get there first or ends of getting what Indy finds. They are both after the same thing and it's a rat race to see what is in store for Indy and CO.. Near the ending it is spectacular, and to some views might be a little tense, but it's not that bad. I loved the last of the movie the warehouse scene, it seemed like the perfect ending to an excellent movie. I would recommend this movie to any1, especially to Harrison Ford fans you won't be disappointed. Kris L. CocKayne",10,0,0,18 April 2012

An Imperial weapon so powerful it has the ability to destroy planets. It gets its power from the planet Jedha. A planet where crystals are mined an used to power the weapon, as well as providing energy to Light sabers. Galin left the Empire to raise his daughter Jyn( Felicity Jones) and spend time with his wife. They live a simple life on Edau, where he farms. When Capt. Orsen Krennic( Ben Mendelson) tracks him down on Edau. He wants Galin to come back with him. Krennic is cold, he kills Galin's wife and Jyn is captured. She is taken to a holding cell, there she will be transported to Wodani. Wodani is an Imperial penal labor camp. On her way there she is rescued by Cassian Andor(Diego Lunas) and his Imperial Droid K-2SO. K-2SO was reprogrammed by the Alliance so he can be a mole on both sides. Cassian has been part of the Alliance ever since he was a kid. When he meets Jyn she tells him that she must meet with the senior council. She gives them what she know about the Death Star and they share what they know. The down side is The senior council will not approve an attack on the Empire.Jyn and Cassian decide to find other Rebels that will join their mission in findiing the plans that can destroy The Death Star. They travel to several planets. There they meet several people that want to join up to stop the Empire.

When the plans arrive on Leia's Blockage Runner. While under attack a rebel fighter hands the plans to another fighter. The plans arrive to Princess Leia( Carrie Fisher). Once she sees the plans she discovers there hope in destroying the Empire and their most powerful weapon.I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD, hoping for extras. Unlike the weak prequels, the CGI effects in this movie are excellent. Especially with the late great, Peter Cushing(Gov.Tarkin) and a very young Princess Leia( Carrie Fisher). This film is much better than The Force Awakens which I gave a 7/10. There is so much excitement it will keep you glued from the beginning to the end. Ignore the small amount of negative reviews some have expressed,with this film. It has a great cast, excellent story; and beautiful scenery which makes this a hit. Disney did an excellent job with Rogue One. The director ( Gareth Williams) who I'm unfamiliar with Brass to this story. In conclusion, Rogue One is a great introduction to A New Hope.THX, Kris L.

O'Donnell gets CIA fixer Tony Mendez( Ben Afflack) to get them out. O'Donnell and Mendez devise a plan, make a fake movie. A Sy-Fy flick, like the super blockbuster, Star Wars.Mendez will pretend to be a Hollywood film producer, who is scouting locations to shoot in Tehran, Iran. He talks with Les Siegal( Alan Arkin) a huge movie producer and John Chambers( John Goodman) a Hollywood make-up artist for help. The film ARGO, an out of this world SY-Fy Flick. In conjunction with the Canadian government a plan is set. The help Of the Canadian Government is a must. A creation of six fake Canadian Passports are created and given to Mendez before he leaves for Iran.Mendez is on his way to pull off a rescue mission were no mistakes can be made. Once he lands in Tehran, he his taken to she the hostages. He tells them who he is and his plan for getting them out. He also explains they too, have a part in this also. He is going to teach them how to act as a film crew, and everybody needs to know what their part is or it's-GOODBYE. They do rehearsals, promote the film with fake posters, and mingle with the citizen's. They have to gain some trust with the local's to ease their nerves. As this goes on for awhile , they have to watch every move they make. It is a hostile area gun fire is active, people are getting executed in broad daylight, and check points are everywhere.When it is time to escape it looks like they are going to have issues. The plan tickets of some of the hostages arrive late. They undergo constant screening, and they make Lee Schatz take his sunglasses off twice. It especially gets tense when they get ready to board. One guard/ Iranian police holds them at the gate forever. A security call is made to check on Tony Mendez. In the states the call comes in, but it rings forever. At the right time Chambers answers the phone, a check is made about the location of Mendez. Chambers tells them his on location, big break.It checks out and they are finally free to board. These Americans were held for 87 days in Tehran, Iran. Thanks to the help of the Canadian government these hostages got home, and the rest is history.I have to admit the first time I watched this movie, I hated it. I recently re watched again and liked it. I do like Rory Cochrane and thought he was excellent as Lee Schatz to a T. I have never been a fan of Ben Afflack, but he was decent in this one. I do want to see his new movie THE WAY BACK, because it's about basketball. I want to see it because I played for yrs.As for the film, I believe it was overrated, but what Oscar winning film isn't these days?",8,0,0,28 April 2020

They kidnap people mainly backpackers, torture them and kill them for big money. Paxton is lucky he escapes along with Kana. Just when he thinks he's safe one thing still stands in his way, he must end it in order to survive this nightmare.This movie is full of unnecessary gore, and makes Slovakia look like a tourist nightmare. I don't like to praise movies that make a state or Country look like S**T. It's very low class and it hurts the people who live there. The only thing I got out of this movie was a lesson. Don't Be Gullible And Trust Everyone. These kids thought they owned it all and only found trouble. To me Hostel 2 is so much better than the original, it has more of a plot, less F-Bombs, and less gore. So if you want my advice skip the first, and go directly to the sequel.",5,0,0,18 August 2016

She is in a Jeep, has a dog by her side, and John Connor will soon be born. This is one of my favorites, it has a lot of action, the plot is excellent, and the cast ROX. This film will make you wonder, will machines eventually take over our future?",10,1,3,29 July 2019

It seems like Chris and Gucci are in present of Silent Hill.Gucci goes on to explain about the coal fire's that still burn some 30 years later, and about the radicals that would have town meetings. They were like the towns cultist with a fanatical leader, Christabella(Alice Kruig. They would meet in the early 70's and try to purge the evil from Alissa, because she was the only child without a father. Christabella would try to get answers from Alissa's mother, Dahlia(Debra Kara Unger), on the father. When it flashes back to the 70's when Alissa was young,you see, the taunts, the fires, and the rituals that were done to Alessia and Dahlia. While Rose and Bennett are in the gray part of Silent Hill, they meet Christabella and the radicals. Rose escapes their wrath while Bennett is eventually sacrificed. When Rose meets Alissa, she is amazed by the likeness between her and Sharon. The only way Rose can escape Silent Hill's dark world is to learn about Alissa, the dark past of the town, and some of town's ritualistic members and their ways.I love this psychological thriller, the story is different and can be confusing. The history of Silent Hill's past and present, and what the monster's represent is very interesting. I even had to do a little research on the Movie on the net concerning this. The only thing I found odd about the movie was the time-line. Alissa has to be Sharon's birth mother; but there is a plot hole concerning this. Also if Officer Gucci was one of the officer's during the burning back in the 70's why hasn't he aged? The ending was strange, even though Rose and Sharon escaped Silent Hill, they are still trapped a purgatory state. Yes, this movie had some minor flaws; but it is still one of the better horror films of the 21st Century.",9,0,0,29 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," ' Together Again....Wouldn't Miss It'.
","In Return Of The Jedi, the movie picks up were Empire left off. A couple of years may have gone by, but the viewer will get it. Luke Skywalker( Mark Hamill), has a plan to save Capt. Solo from Jabba The Hutt. The droids arrive on Tatoonie explaining how Lando never made it back. We see C-3P0(Anthony Daniels) and R2D2(Kenny Baker) arrive at Jabba's palace.

They also meet the Ewoks, the indigenous tribe of Endor. The help of the Ewoks, help Han and company capture Imperials on Endor, and Han is able to get the shield down so the Death Star Can be destroyed.I loved this movie, the best one is The Empire Strikes Back, but it is hard to choose with these masterpieces. When these movies were made, movie making changed forever. I also own the original unaltered copies on VHS. It's nice to have to view them before the changes were made; because they don't make them like this anymore. The stunning effects, visuals, and time gone into these blockbusters; WOW. I remember when I was 6, going to see Star Wars, the first scene blew me away. I knew I would be a fan forever.",9,0,0,12 April 2016
Alien," In Space No One Can Hear You Scream.
","Alien is one film that once you watch it you never will forget it. It begins with the haunting artwork from the late H.R. Giger to the outstanding cast of Tom Skerritt( Dallas), Sigourney Weaver(Ripley), Veronica Cartwright( Lambert), late Harry Dean Stanton(Brett), John Hurt( Kane), Iam Holm(Ash), Yaphet Kotto( Parker) and the excellent performance from the late Bolaji Badejo( Alien). The cast is perfect and the director Ridley Scott delivers a Sy Fy/Horror fright for eternity.The film begin with the crew of The Nostromo coming back from some off world with mineral ore. They are headed back to Antarctica with so many tons of ore aboard. It is the 22nd century yr 2122 so living in Antarctica could become a reality then? When they think there job is complete, Mother(the ship's communicator)or brain, picks up a distress signal from a remote planet. Ash, The science officer, tells the crew it's an S.O.S., and it must be checked out. The crew is outraged when they find out if they don't they forfeit all their shares. So they land on the remote moon of LV-426. A small group consisting of Kane, Lambert, and Capt. Dallas investigate. The planet is desolate and a crashed ship is there. When they venture inside they explore what looks to be an alien ship. When they investigate further they discover this huge area filled with eggs. Now when Kane decides to investigate one of these eggs, the S**T starts to go south. One of them opens up and attaches to his face. I kid you not it looks like crab-like creature. This is the second stage of the Alien-A Face Hugger. When the crew return they get in, but were suppose to be quarantined. Ash disregarded the protocols and opened the hatch. Kane is in a COMA-like state, but this thing looks like it is helping him stay alive. when Dallas tries to remove it, acid from the thing is released. Ash is really a android, and was sent on this mission at the last minute. So the crew is wondering what will happen to Kane?Well a couple days later the face hugger detaches itself and Kane just needs to wake up. Now when Ripley goes in to check on Kane, the facehugger is still alive and somewhere in the lab. Ash sees it; and directs it towards Ripley, it drops, but it 's dead it's purpose is over. So Ripley wants it gone, but Ash keeps it to study and admire it.The next day Kane is awake and is starving, so the crew decides to have one last meal before continuing on home. So they are all setting down for dinner telling each other the first thing they will do when they return home. All of a sudden, it appears Kane is choking. So they all get concerned and help him out, except for Ash who is just observing. The next thing you know Kane is on the table, and something bursts from his chest-Chest burster.( Stage 3) A small alien like creature that comes from Kane. Those looks from the actor's are REAL, according to the cast and director. Everyone wants to kill it right then and there, except Ash, but it's so fast. So a plan is in the works to kill the thing , thinking it will be easy-WRONG. They split in teams, but are unaware the alien has reached Stage 5 shed it's skin and now about 7 feet tall. The crew discovers they are all expendable and Ash is to blame. They do everything in there power to try and kill it, but it's indestructible. One by one the crew falls, until they find out Ash is an android, and may know a way to kill it. There is no way and the shuttle can't hold 3 people, so Ripley, Lambert, and Parker are left. Lambert and Parker go get more fuel on there way the two become prey, and Ripley is the only one left. She has a plan so she decides to destroy the ship and work her way to the shuttle. On her way there she has a few run in with the Xenomorph , but is able to get aboard. Once aboard the thing is hidden in there with her. So she plays it smooth, gets a spacesuit on open the outer door and blasts the thing in outer space. In the end she is safe and sound in her sleep chamber set for home. A great movie you will never forget.",10,1,2,4 October 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Very Disappointed!
","I rented this movie 3 nights ago, and last night I tried to watch it. I am not a fan of musicals, even though I do like West Side Story. I also am not that big of fan of Tim Burton, I have seen several of is movies and have only liked Sleepy Hollow and Frankenwiennie. I started watching the film and new it was a musical, but I can't stand it when most of the movie is sung. I had to turn the caption on because I couldn't hear some of the dialog. I watched an hour of it, and it's not like I turned it off 5 minutes into the movie, I just couldn't get into it. I thought this was one of the worst roles for Johnny Depp, of coarse thats my opinion. To me he no matter how hard he tries, is not not a villain. I knew it was a dark film and had some gore to it, but I just wasn't expecting the throat slicing that early in the film. I thought this movie was more gory than Friday the 13TH. Tes, this movie had some big names in it, but that doesn't mean it is going to be an automatic hit to all. I am sorry if I have upset any fans of the movie, but this movie just didn't do it for me; and I love Horror and Thriller movies.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",1,1,4,30 October 2013
Shutter Island," Who Is Number 67?
","I went to see this at the theater on opening day, not only did I see it once but twice, it's that good. Imagine an ex US Marshal who was put in an Institution for the mentally ill/criminally insane. It happened to Teddy Daniels, an Ex US Marshal in the 1950's. The story starts out as an interesting on to Marshal's show up on Shutter Island for an investigation. Once there clues start to pop up about a missing patient Andrew Laddius. Daniels and his partner start to investigate this so called missing patient or # 67. The viewer starts to put the puzzle together, with the help of other patients at Sutter Island we see that this is not a real investigation, it is a last ditch effort to cure Teddy Daniels. He was committed two years ago when he found out his wife killed their 3 children. I would say maybe he had some sort of break down or something that part wasn't clear to me.Teddy's doctor is doing a new treatment in order to cure Teddy Daniels of his violent behavior. It is like a role playing game they are preforming at Shutter Island. Teddy/Andrew Laddius, must convince the doctor he is cured of his delusions of being a current U.S. Marshal or else this experimental treatment is all for nothing and the next step for Teddy is a Lobotomy . This treatment has most everyone involved, that works there; as well as some of the patients, and his partner is really his psychiatrist. In the end Teddy/Andrew finds out the truth, what his doctor is doing, what happened to put him as a patient at Sutter Island, but in the end when you think he would snap out of it he doesn't. I thought with an experimental treatment, maybe it would work. Then the ending comes and he begins to talk to his psychiatrists/doctor, like he's still with the Marshal Service. Then U see the psychiatrist shake his head; and they come to take Teddy away.I loved the movie; but the ending I thought could have been better. I thought sure he would snap out of it and realize that it was a therapeutic way to treat him; but it failed. I guess if anyone when though the psychological trauma he did, it would be a miracle if you could heal from that. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",10,3,6,9 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Rey Finds Her True Identity In The Rise Of SkyWalker.
","If you thought you knew everything about Kylo Ren( Adam Driver) and Rey's( Dasily Ridley) relationship you will be surprised in Rise Of Skywalker. The plot is surprising and that's why I feel it is the best of the three sequels. Supposedly episode 9 is the final chapter of the saga, but we also thought Jedi was it too. In TROS we not only find out Rey's true identity, but a few characters from the original trilogy make an appearance which also adds to the movie. If you hated this movie then either you had your mind made up before hand or you are comparing it to the originals. So open you mind and enjoy this exciting conclusion. So enjoy my review of The Rise Of Skywalker.
In The Rise Of Skywalker Poe(Oscar Isaac) and Finn( John Boyega) are returning from the uncharted Sith planet of Exegol. While they are there they discover the shocking truth that Emperor Palpatine is still alive, and didn't perish in ROTJ. They rush back to D'Qar to report the shocking news to General Leia. On D'Qar we also notice Rey is completing her Jedi training and is more powerful then ever.Kylo Ren who still thirst for power discovers a Wayfinder on Exegol. He is planning to form a new Empire and his desire is to replace the Emperor( Ian McDiarmid) and have Rey by his side. One problem still haunt Kylo his struggles with the Lightside. He knows now that Rey is a Jedi she will be coming after him, trying to turn him to The Resistance. If he refuses she will have to confront him possibility for the final time. Rey and Kylo communicate via the force trying to get each other to join their side. Kylo is on Exegol and Rey is on Starbase( I believe it is). She rushes to Exegol and the two battle it out. Rey returns to D'Qar were she discovers General Leia is in poor health. Kylo is left alone on Exegol when Han's ( Harrison Ford) ghost appears. He calls out to Kylo but by his birth-name Ben. Something changes with Kylo and he starts to drawn to the Lightside. Once his touching moment with Han is over he senses is mothers death.He returns to D'Qar to be by her side until the very end. After his mother's death he changes, and starts to go by the name Ben. Ben and Rey know there is still one last thing to do. They must return to Exegol to confront The Emperor. While they are on this dark planet, The Emperor shocks her with the news of her parents true Identity, as well as hers. She is the She is the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine. Once this is reveled the truth leads to a battle to the death of the Emperor and Ben.In the end, Rey returns to Tatooine and goes to Luke's( Mark Hamill) homestead.There she buries Luke's and Leia's Lightsabre's; and sees their Force Ghost's. She lights up her lightsabre with is yellow; I signify the yellow color as the Rise Of A New Era Of The Jedi. Her lightsabre is lit and she takes the surname Skywalker in honor of the two.",10,2,21,9 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Lot Of CGI And Bad Acting Leads To Mixed Reviews
","Let me start by saying I'm not a big fan of the Star Wars prequels. I grew up on the originals, and expected so much more. The originals had so much effort go into them from the creation of miniatures, special effects, and the chemistry from then unknown actors. It was magical, and changed movie making from then on. Those three films made George Lucas as well as Harrison Ford rocket to success. When the prequels came out though I was SHOCKED. I thought, 'Lucas what have you done'? From creating a masterpiece at first; but the prequels-What were you thinking.Attack Of The Clones was O.K.; but that's it. I gave this movie a 7 but would of given it a 7 1/2; because I liked most of the story. The acting was a bit lame, the chemistry between the two main actors wasn't there. I think Portman tried; but Hayden Christensen is just not an actor. I still wonder how he got such a big role, in a major movie? The supporting cast Obi-Wan( Ewan McGregor), Jango Fett( Temurea Morrison), Mace Windu( Samuel L. Jackson) and Chancellor Palpaline( Ian Mc Diarmid); did a pretty good job.The story however is actually good, at least it was to me. After the failed assignation attempt on Padme Amidala; Kenobi and Skywalker are assigned to protect her. One night Jango Fett hires Jem( Leeanna Walman) for a second assignation attempt. Fett gives Jem some type of poisonous centipedes. The deliver a lethal sting to it's target. Jem travels to Padme's sleeping chamber; and drops them through her window. This alerts Kenobi and Skywalker thus saving Padme. They then go after the assassin, When Skywalker learns that the assassin is a changeling he alerts Kenobi. They both check out a bar and find her; chasing her into the streets of Corusant. Kenobi and Skywalker ask her who hired her for the job? She keeps silent at first then starts to tell them. When she starts to say it was a bounty hunter, she is killed by a toxic dart. Kenobi is curious and needs to investigate more on the dart, to see who could be responsible for the assassination attempts. He goes to see his old friend DAX at his diner. Dax looks at it and says it's a Kamino saber dart. He explains to Kenobi that it comes from those Cloner's on Kamino. It has distinctive marks/symbols that gives it away. When Kenobi finds this out his new assignment is to travel to Kamino and investigate more.Anakin has a new assignment to take Amidala back to her home word of Naboo. There Anakin is to protect her; and keep her safe. To me this is were the story gets sappy and boring. Padme and Anakin get to know each other more; and begin to fall in love. While on Naboo; Skywalker keeps having dreams about his mother. He tells Padme this and tells her he has to go back to Tatoonie. He fears his mother's life might be in danger. Once the two are on Tatoonie, Anakin finds out his mother is no longer a slave. She is married to Cliegg Lars(Jack Thompson). Anakin and Padme travel to Lars' homestead. There they meet Cliegg, Owen(Joel Edgeton) and Beru(Bonnie Piesse. Cliegg begins to tell Anakin the story about how his mother was captured by the Sand People. Cliegg fears that she is dead, but AnaKin has his doubts. He tells Padme to stay with the Lars' because he is going to rescue his mother. Even though Anakin tries to save his mother it's too late. He brings her back to the homestead to bury her. This part of the movie is interesting, because we begin to see Skywalker's transformation to the Darkside. He is showing out of control rage, hunger for power, and lack of emotional control. Hayden's drama queen acting makes the scene somewhat laughable, UGH.Meanwhile, Obi-Wan gets more answers while on Kamino; especially when he meets Jango Fett. When Kenobi starts to leave he and Jango get into it. For awhile they fight, but Kenobi is able to put a tracking system on his ship; Slave 1. Obi-Wan tracks Jango to Genosis; and sends a signal to Anakin. The message is sent; but Anakin is on Tatoonie. When Akakin and Padme arrive on Genosis, they along with Kenobi are scheduled for execution. Count Dooku( Christoper Lee) pulls off a brilliant performance even though it's small. Genosis is where The Clone Wars begin, the rise of The Empirestarts ; and Boba Fett takes the place of his fallen father. He will become of of the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy.The Clone Wars is better than The Phantom Menace; because there is less Jar Jar. The things that hurt this film was the over the top use of CGI; and some bad performances. I am so glad Padme's character is tough in Episode 2, because in ROTS she does a 360. To me CGI is O.K. in some of the film; in fact some scenes can't be done without it. When a film relies heavy on it or does it all in CGI, it takes away from the movie magic.THX, Kris L.

Predator," If You Lose It Down Here, You're In A World Of Hurt.
","Predator is another exciting alien film that stars Jesse Ventura( Blaine), Arnold Schwarzeneggar( Dutch) and Carl Weathers as (Dillion). Dillon is a corrupt CIA agent who wants to sent Dutch and his elite military crew on a mission. He knows Dutch and his team will be walking into a trap; but doesn't care. They're sent to Latin America on a rescue mission to free hostages from guerrilla fighters. Little does the team know that once they are there, they'll have to fight in jungle. It isn't just the guerrillas they have to fight, but little do they know an unseen enemy is among them. This predator uses the jungle as a playground, jumping from tree to tree; and is super fast. It is an alien like no other, an enemy that hunts cloaked and finds It's victim by they're body heat.When the team comes across a prisoner( Anna)Elpida Carrino she speaks Spanish, and one of the team just picks out words she's describing. At first they think she is crazy, but something is following them Dutch, Sonny and Poncho can feel it. Later on they find remains of human victims, and Anna can speak English. One by one Dutch's team is hunted down in the most gruesome way possible. When Anna and Dutch are the only ones left, Dutch has a plan to hunt it down. Dutch tells Anna to go back to the chopper, and inform them what has happened. Dutch while escaping from the predator, gets covered in mud. The predator is unable to see him and Dutch has a plan. He starts booby trapping the jungle and he waits for it to come. When the predator sets off some of the booby traps one gets him good. The two finally meet and it is something too see. When it takes off it's mask, I have never seen something so bizarre looking. Then the famous line uttered by Dutch WTF are you is classic. The predator realizes it's been beaten and isn't going to survive. It begins a self destruct sequence, and Dutch hurries out of there. In the end, Anna and Dutch leave on the Helicopter, they are the only ones who survived and are rescued. Predator is another great Sy-Fy movie that gets your attention from the beginning. It was so successful it spawned a sequel Predator and many more. The sequel is awesome and Alien vs. Predator ROX. I also got to view Predators, and that was another success. You have to check this classic out from 1987, you will not be disappointed.",9,1,1,24 April 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines Mixes A lot Of Action With Some Comedic Scenes.
","I watched this movie and was very surprised. I actually liked this movie, better than I thought. I picked this movie up at Hastings entertainment store, for 1.99. I am glad I got my money's worth, it's not the best of the series; but I am surprised by some of the negative comments. My favorite of the series is Terminator, it will always be. I rarely like sequels except for The Empire Strikes Back. I did have a WTF moment in T3 because it did start to get lame for about 15 minutes around the 20 minute mark. I thought I would be turning it off, but I was so wrong. The funny parts were the strip club, especially the dancer, and some of Arnold's quotes. I especially liked the fact they decided to make a female Terminator. In most movies Hollywood seems to portray females as damsels in distress. That is type casting and it is old and so wrong, that's why I hate Hollywood sometimes. They need a dose of reality sometimes. This is the third installment of the franchise and I thought it was good. Even though Nick Stahl played John Conner I thought he was great. I loved the storyline, and the ending was a surprise. If you liked T1 & T2 you should like 3. It is a movie you will either like or hate, but regardless of what some say this is a great follow up",8,6,7,30 July 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Come With Me If You Want To Live.
","Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place 10 years after the first Terminator was sent to kill Sarah Connor( Linda Hamilton). John Connor ( Edward Furlong), is a wayward youth, with an attitude. He lives with his step parent Todd Voight( Xander Berkeley) and Janelle Voight( Janette Goldstein). His step parents are kind of hateful, and John hates them. Sarah is locked up in Pascaclero State Hospital. She is stronger and still no one will believe her story about the Terminator and Reese. Dr. Stillman ( Earl Boen) finds her story absurd. Especially the one about Reese coming back from 2029 and protecting her, then fathering her child. Sarah is having no success getting released early no matter what she does.In T2-Judgement Day two terminators are sent back, one is a more powerful model, the T-100 ( Robert Pactrick) and T-100 ( Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-100 has been reprogrammed to protect John Connor. The T-1000 is sent to eliminate him. The T-1000 is more powerful, indestructible, and made of liquid metal. When Sarah comes face to face with the T-100 her fears come back, until she sees the T-1000. The T-100 has been reprogrammed for protection, not destruction. Sarah still wants to kill it though, but john has developed a strong bond with it. The T-1000 can take the worst impact of a bullet /weapon and is able to heal in no time. It is able to imitate anyone or anything. Sarah, John, and T-100 have to make a plan to destroy it. They must first find Skynet and the creator of the Cyberdine systems. By keeping there chips and part of the first terminator, he is creating a path for Earth's destruction in 1997. If they find the chip they can destroy it and possibly change Earth's destruction. In the Skynet scene there is a lot of action, but it is success. I thing still remains the destruction of the T-1000. They find a steel plant and destroy it by putting it in hot steel, but one cyber chip remains the T-100. When John learns the terminator needs to terminate, Sarah and John must lower him in the steel. It's for the best, but John has lost a friend even if it is an android. This is a great sequel, the special effects were out of this world. I believe the special effects made the movie, and it was nice to see Arnold as the good guy. A great film all around.",9,0,0,29 July 2019
Ender's Game," Game Over
","I watched this last night and was shocked by how horrible it was. This was one of the worst movies I had seen with Harrison Ford in it since the Mosquito Coast. I realize it starts out in the future, but a school for kids with perfect behavioral skills, superior intelligence, and the ability to save the world. It just doesn't get it for me. I am a sci-fi fan, total Star Wars fanatic, but this film doesn't compare to some of the sci-fi movies I have seen. I thought the acting was wooden, Harrison Ford looked like he just wanted a pay check. I watched this movie from beginning to end hoping it would get better, waiting for the plot to come in, and found myself very disappointed. The only thing that made me happy was the fact I got this movie for free at Redbox. For all sci-fi fans pass this one up, and get a classic sci-fi movie like The Martian Chronicles. I believe you will find this movie better, more entertaining, but make time for it. The Martian Chronicles is in three parts, but it's classic that shouldn't be past up.Kris L.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo-KICKS A$$!
","I didn't get a chance to see this movie at the theater last year, so I did what most people do and wait until it came out on DVD. This film caught my interest right from the start, the acting was incredible, especially the performance by Rooney Mara. I had never heard of her until I saw her at this year's Oscar's, I think she or the film was up for an Academy Award. I heard of Stieg Larson, who wrote the book, but I heard his books skip around and are very long. So I decided to see the movie first. This was such a great film, U have an outcast, who is very intelligent who knows everything about computers, but has a very unusual style. She catches the eye of Daniel Craig, who is working a case and wants her help in case that goes back years. A case involving the brutal killings of women spanning years. The person responsible is a little predictable, but that's type casting and the only flaw I saw with the movie. I have to say in some of the scenes are disturbing, and didn't add much to the movie, even though the guy who was in charge of her finances deserved what he got. I'm no prude, but there are a few sexual scenes that didn't add much to the movie, Thank GOD they were quick. This movie has everything suspense, excitement to the end, and who done it , that to some the killer was predictable. In the end Mara and Craig make a great team and even though the killer went free for many year, justice does get served to him the end in this terrific thriller. THX, Kris L.

Aliens," James Cameron Hits A Home Run With ALIENS
","After destroying the Nostromo Ripley( Sigourney Weaver)) is discovered by a deep Space Salvage crew. She is taken to a space processing station. While there she is met by Weyland-Yutani employee ,Carter Burke( Paul Riser). While recovering from a deep hyper sleep she finds out 57 years have past. After recovering fully she receives some news about her daughter. She is distraught to hear she has passed with no surviving children. The two then head to her briefing with company executives. There she explains what happened to her crew and why she was forced to destroy the Nostromo. The Weyland Corporation is convinced she acted recklessly and sees her unfit as a flight officer. They pull her flight license, then is shocked to learn that 157 colonists have occupied LV426 for 20 years.A day later Burke comes asking for Ripley's help. He is accompanied by Lt. Gorman( William Hope) part of a group of Colonial Space Marines. These Marines are trained for anything. Burke tells Ripley they have lost contact with LV426. At first Ripley refuses, but if she goes her flight license would be restored.

These marines have no idea what they are facing until Ripley explains that one was able to get aboard the Nostromo; and wipe out her crew in less than 24 hours. This especially gets Vasquez's attention( Janette Goldstein), after her smart remark towards Ripley. Thus, it will take more than fire power to rid a Xenomorph. Among these colonial Marines are Hudson( the Late Bill Paxton), Hicks( Michael Biehn), Bishop( Lance Henriksen).Once the crew lands on LV426 it looks like a demilitarized zone. The crew checks out the inside of the complex and notice the remains of small arms fire, and destruction from Alien activity( damage from molecular acid). This brings back memories for Ripley.

Ripley makes it a fact she wants them destroyed; but Bishop explains Burke wants them studied and taken back. This makes Ripley suspicious and she keeps her guard up.The next step is locating the colonists PDT( Personal Data Transmitters) while they are in the operations lab. They locate what think is all of the colonist over at the processing station. When they are in the area they proceed in and notice, secreted resin, and past alien activity.As they proceed, they are ambushed not bu one alien; but many. They lose half of there platoon, and Lt. Gorman gets hurt. Ripley does what she can, and rescues those remaining from the processing station. After the loss of over half their crew, they decide to nuke the site from orbit. It fails due to an alien aboard the ship, as soon as it takes off it crashes. So the group has to return to operations and devise a new plan.Once in operations they need to devise a plan to destroy these aliens, but they are running short on ammo. In the meantime, Hicks gets close to Ripley showing her how to use a pulse rifle with grenade launcher. He also gives her a wrist tracker. He is very caring toward Ripley and tells her to get some sleep. So she and Newt get a nap, but when Ripley wakes she notices she is locked in the lab, and 2 face huggers are loose. Burke has double crossed Ripley trying to get an alien back to the company. To do this one would impregnate Ripley or Newt, and he would sabotage Hicks space capsule so no one would know.Suddenly the remote sentries pick up movement outside the complex, they only last so long. They need to get to the emergency vent which goes off every 4 hrs.. He is the only one that can remote pilot the Suloco, and he volunteers to go out. The remaining Marines Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, Ripley and Gorman. Have to keep them from breaking their barrier. So each of them take turns making sure nothing breaches their perimeter. As they keep watch, they realize they have found a way in, through the roof and floors. Thus, leaving Ripley, Hicks, Gorman, Vasquez the only ones left.While they are escaping Newt gets separated from Ripley, and falls into a shaft. She is able to locate her signal, but Ripley accidentally walks into the queens nest. Carefully she watches every move she makes, so she can escape. Then she uses the grenade launcher, plus fire to destroy the eggs and her egg sack. She reaches the landing platform and tells Bishop she is returning 4 Newt, so don't leave. When she goes back in she has so many minutes to locate Newt and get back. She finds her, but she has been cocooned. She still rescues her, and carefully works her way back. To her surprise Bishop isn't there, but suddenly shows. In the end, Ripley, Bishop, and Newt return only to find the Queen Alien is aboard the ship. Bishop is all but destroyed helping Ripley fight it, but in the end it is blown out into outer space.This movie came out in 1986 and I still have fond memories seeing it as a 15 yr old in Dayton, Ohio .Aliens is just as good as the original, but Alien is still the best. The acting is excellent especially from Sigourney Weaver, and Janette Goldstein as Vasquez. I loved her style and I saw myself in her character, so BAD A$$. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SPECIAL EDITION, IT HAS OF 17 MINUTES OF RESTORED FOOTAGE; A MAJOR PLUS TO THE MOVIE.",10,1,3,21 October 2019
Non-Stop," After 9/11, Do You Really Feel Safe With Homeland Security?
","Non-Stop is action packed from beginning to end. Bill Marks(Liam Neeson),was an ex NYPD officer at one time; until personal problems hit. Basically his drinking, the loss of his daughter to Cancer, and a failed marriage sent him over the edge. Once fired from the NYPD, he was transferred to TSA. He is now a Federal Air Marshal. He is getting ready to board an international flight to London. He is teamed up with another Marshal, Jack Hammond(Anson Mount). Marks is a nervous flyer especially during take off. Another passenger Jen Summers( Julian Moore), who wants a window seat gets one next to Marks. Once in the air, everything seems to be going smoothly. Bill gets up to go to the lavatory to sneak a smoke. Once he returns he receives a very personal text from one of the passengers. The text tells him to transfer 150 million dollars into account in 20 minutes. Marks gets up to see who it could be; he searches up and down the plane. He then alerts the Captain David McMillian(Linus Roach). The threat has to be reported to TSA, and be verified. Marks tells Nancy(Michelle Dockery) one of the flight attendants, as well as Gwen(Lupita Nyong'o).He knows Nancy well, and explains the situation. He tells her to meet him in the galley in back. Then he walks back to Jen's seat, flashes his badge; and tells her to come back with him. Since the only two people on the flight he trusts at the moment are Jen and Nancy he has a plan. He wants the two to view the cameras ,and tell him who might be using a phone to text. Jen keeps telling Bill, it's the guy up front(Jack). Bill tells her three time it's not him, but then Bill gets suspicious when he sees the camera. He texts Jack back to the galley, they talk; and Jack denies it. Jack returns to his seat, but five minutes later Bill's phone gets a text, Jack comes back to the lavatory with a briefcase. This time Jack and Bill have it out, the texts have been coming from Jack. Jack explains to Bill the money could really help him. This time the fight continues; and jack tries to kill Bill, but Bill breaks his neck in the bathroom. Afterwards Bill discovers what is in the briefcase, Cocaine. Bill, thinking the threat has been neutralized receives another text. Jack Hammond was just a fall guy, the threat is still on the plane. Another text comes through; if the money isn't transferred in twenty minutes someone on the plane will die. Once Bill receives this he notifies the Captain. Captain McMillian finds out the account is in Bill's name. McMillian is ordered to confiscate his badge and gun. McMillian tells Bill to just set back and enjoy the flight. Jen overhears what is going on, but instead of assuming anything she stands by him all the way. Bill refuses to just set back, someone is setting him up, and he his taking matters into his own hands. The texts continue back and forth, and the passengers are starting to ask questions.Unaware to Bill, and the rest of the passengers are two ex-military passengers, Zack and Tom. They are the ones who are sending these texts to prove a point. They succeed in killing the pilot, and another passenger, Charles Wheeler(Frank Deal). The method they use is darts that are dipped in poison. The darts cause antiphalic shock, it is severe enough once injected nothing can be done. The way things are going makes Bill Marks look like he is the terrorist, due to his background. By then passengers are getting conflicting reports about Marks from the news. Marks goes back to the lavatory, and discovers a bomb. The bomb was hidden in the Cocaine. The bomb is a military style bomb that is impossible to disarm. He has thirty minutes to save the passengers, and with the help of some of them hopefully save the plane. In order to have any chance of survival, they will try a new procedure to protect the people when the bomb detonates. Around this time Bill Marks, and the rest of the passengers find out who is responsible for the terrorism. It is Zack White(Nate Parker); and Tom Bowden(Scoot McNairy). They carry this plan out to extort money from TSA. To show the people how flawed Homeland Security is.This movie is good, except for some of the ending. No plane can sustain that much damage; and have somewhat of a happy ending. A known fact speaking from having Criminal Justice experience. If a law enforcement officer of any kind has a drug/alcohol problem they are finished. They would not have the opportunity to transfer to another agency. I guess that's why I gave it 8 out of ten. I would have given it a 9 out of ten if it wasn't that exaggerated. I really loved the story; and the way it keeps you guessing. Liam Neeson is also another plus to this film. He is one of my favorite actors who's talent, looks, and style are one of a kind.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",8,0,0,13 February 2015
The Game," What Do You Get For Someone Who Has Everything, A Trip To CRS.
","This is one of the best movies from 1997, it is intelligently done; and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. The movie is about Nicholas Van Orton ( Michael Douglas), a wealthy bank investor, who has everything. It's his 48th birthday, and it brings back memories from his childhood. His father was 48 when he committed suicide. My impression from watching the movie was, Van Orton, is afraid he would end up like his father.When his brother Conrad comes to San Francisco, and hands him a Birthday card, he wonder what Conrad really wants. Conrad Van Orton ( Sean Penn) is the somewhat troubled younger brother. He has had a troubled past and Nick is wondering if Conrad might be in trouble again. Once Nick opens the card he sees this invitation to CRS, Community Recreational Services. A place where people can go for a GAME. Conrad explained that he used their services in Europe; and the experience was incredible.Nicholas ponders on this and decides to go to CRS. Once there he takes a physical, psychological, and visual exams. He believes it's a waste of time; but he is just new to it. The next day he gets the call from CRS saying his application is deigned. He thinks it's no big deal and goes home, once he is through the gate of his house he sees this plastic clown. He brings it in and does a WTF. He decides it's a joke and goes on with his evening. He is sitting down; and watching this type of Finance Channel. He discovers that his game is beginning, he gets instructions about CRS and realizes he will be getting several keys; and it's up to him to discover when to use them. This movie is a roller coaster of fun. It takes Nicholas from his boring rich life to a life of excitement, suspense, and thrills. It's what his life is missing and that is what Nicholas Van Orton's game is. Near the end it is almost too much for him, because he is unaware that it's just a game. His game puts excitement in his life, but it comes close to taking him over the edge.I loved this movie, too bad there is no such place that can give you something your life is lacking. I don't understand why I have seen some negative reviews unless it's because some didn't understand the plot. All in all this is a great movie, to those who haven't seen it you will not be disappointed. It's one of the best movies I have seen Michael Douglas in, so check it out. The movie makes you think and keeps you on the edge until the very end.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",9,2,3,14 April 2013
The Game," The Game Is On!
","Nicholas Van Orton is an Investment Banker who has everything. He is very well organized, very successful, and always in control. The one thing that is missing in Nicholas's life is excitement. It's his 48th Birthday and lately he has been remembering his father. His father was 48th when he committed suicide, so Nicholas isn't very excited about his big 48th. When his brother, Conrad Van Orton( Sean Penn) calls; the two meet at Nichlas's Club. Conrad gives him a gift like no other. It is an invite to CRS ( Consumer Recreational Services). It is a service that provides games for people. The game is designed around an individuals background, what they like or dislike/ something missing. It's a vacation that comes to the individual; and everyone's game is different. So when Nicholas arrives at CRS; Finegold, the CEO gives him the lowdown about the company. Then Nicholas gives it a go, and after 3 hours of tests he is good to go.When Nicholas gets back to his house his game has begun. When he pulls into his gated driveway, a clown is in the way. He brings it in to his mansion puts it down. He gets ready to watch his nightly financial news station, and notices a key in the clowns mouth. When he continues to watch the news; the program interrupts. The reporter tells him his game has begun, among other things including info on the camera. The reporter informs him about various keys he will be getting. These keys will all be different; and can be anything from a hotel key card to a car window handle. He will have to know how to use them, and finding out the object of the game is up to the player. There is no help your on your own. What Nicholas doesn't know is that everyone he meets is involved in this unique type of role playing game. Especially a friendly he meets at his club Kristina?( Debra Kerr).At this time Nicholas is starting to lose control, something he rarely does. He is starting to believe the events that are taking place are actually happening. He is starting to confuse reality with his game. He is slowly going crazy and things get worse after he is drugged and left for dead in Mexico. The game is truly twisted with lots of suspense. I really enjoyed this movie, because it's different and a total mind upset. In reality, it would never happen. The price and consequences would keep it shelved.",9,1,2,13 June 2019
Unknown," Take Back Your Idenity
","I went to see Unknown at the theater on opening night in February of 2011. I would like to say first of all, I don't agree with those haters of this movie, I thought it was a great movie even though there were some factual errors, Hollywood is not perfect, far from it, LOL :D. I think what drew me to the movie was the plot; it was an exciting movie; and a HELL of a lot better than TAKEN, which was one of the worst Neeson films I saw. This movie had it all, excitement, suspense, and plot twists. I am surprised by the negative views of the movie, to me it was great, it kept you guessing until the end of the film; and I didn't find the plot confusing at all. The only surprise of the movie was Neeson's true identity, that was shocking. I thought the cast was excellent; and the ending wasn't a tragic one. In the end it worked out for Neeson; and it felt good for the viewer that Neeson changed his ways and was going to do a 360 with his life.. He would begin a new life, with his friend that helped him find his way out of his personal hell. This movie is a true winner of 2011 for the whole family, hardly any profanity; especially sex which can ruin a great film. This movie is worth watching more than once; and it's a great addition to your video library.THX, Kris L. CocKayne-abucki4ever71- GO BUCKIS :)",9,0,1,17 January 2012
K-19: The Widowmaker," K-19: A Doomed Voyage Before It Left Port
","Let me start by saying I loved this film. I believe Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford were excellent as Russian captains. The movie takes place in 1961, the Russians have a new nuclear submarine. Before it leaves it is to be christened. Once the champagne bottle is released, it fails to break. All the men of K-19 were shocked. This is usually a bad sign. The crew continues to get prepared to leave. Before leaving there is an accident involving a crew member, and one of the crew has to be replaced due to being drunk on duty. The crew led by Capt. Alexei Vostrikov( Harrison Ford), and Mikhail Polenin(Liam Neeson). During this time it is the height of the Cold War. K-19 is heading toward American waters. It seems all is going well until Lt. Vadim Radtchinko(Peter Sarsgaard) notices the temperature start to rise outside the nuclear reactor room. The controls signify there is a small leak starting in the reactor room. Radtchinko relays this to Polenin, and Vostrikov. The crew must stop it before a disaster like Hiroshima happens. Polenin decides the men must work in shifts, but it keeps getting worse. When going to get the proper equipment the sub only has chemical suits, no radiation suits. The situation gets worse the men know they are doomed, but they must control the leak for a chance of survival. The men go in two's, 10 minutes max in the reactor room. They continue this until the leak is somewhat controlled. All the men take their turn except the Lt.(Sarsgaard) he freezes which doesn't look good, the men, and Polenin are disappointed. They do get the leak slowed down, and it holds for awhile, but eventually it begins again. This time it is worse, and Radtchinko vows not to let the Captains or the men down. He goes in, and tries to control it himself. The crew is hot, suffering from radiation sickness; and the readings are off the chart. Thus begins the waiting game until help can arrive. Once K-19 reaches American waters, The U.S. Navy offers assistance, but Vostrikov refuses. Making the men and Polenin wonder why. Vostrikov says he will not turn his back on Mother Russia, he will not be guilty of treason. The crew is suffering, they arrest Vostrikov and make Polenin lead captain. Polenin at first looks as if he will take this honor, but instead backs his captain. Polenin releases Vostrikov, and those that try to stage the munity I believe are arrested.. This is where I feel Vostrikov is suffering from radiation sickness, and Polenin is probably in the beginning stages. The men are dying, and almost all of them have high radiation levels. From this point the leak gets worse most men are too sick to work in shifts, and the radiation levels keep rising. Vostrikov suffering from radiation sickness, realizes he needs to get his men off this sub ASAP. He calls Moscow, but the request gets denied. He tells Polenin he wants them off ASAP. Polenin reminds him it would mean the end of his military career for in subornation. At this point Vostrikov doesn't care, in awhile another sub comes; and helps rescue the men. The men are decontaminated, and taken aboard. After the rescue Polenin, and Vostrikov get checked at the hospital along with their crew. Once they are able, a trial for in subornation begins. The damage is done, a lot of the men aboard the K-19 eventually end up losing their lives which Vostrikov and Polenin will live with forever.This story is based on a true story, and for 28 years the survivors could not tell their story until the fall of Communism in Russia. I really liked this film; and though I am a huge Neeson/ Ford fan; it was the story that draws you in. The bravery, and sacrifice the crew went through, for the love of their Country was amazing. This film is action packed, from the beginning to the end. A story the world got to know, and the lessons learned from it.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",9,1,2,9 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Really! No One Could Find Anything Positive About This Film?
","If I were giving this film a 1 or 2 star rating like most of you are doing, I would have walked out the theater after 30 minutes or turned off the DVD. If I were still dissatisfied I would have demanded my money back. I agree that this was not the best Star Wars film, however I did find the positives. The return of Poe Dameron ( Oscar Issacs) who has advanced in the ranks. The return of Leia as Commander of The Rebellion Fleet; and the introduction of Vice Admiral Holdo( Laura Dern). In the Last Jedi Rey ( Daisy Ridley) is featured on Achc-To. She is beginning her Jedi training and becoming quite the student, with Master Skywalker( Mark Hamill).Finn( John Boydega) has healed and finds a new friend Rose Tico( Kelli Marie Teare). Poe Finds them and asks for there help for a way to get on General Hux( Donhall Gleeson) Dreadnought ship. For the plan to work they have to keep it from Holdo and contact Maz( Lupino Naug). She tells them they must find a master code breaker on the planet Cardobit. When Rose and Finn arrive they fail to find the master code breaker; because they get arrested. However they do find a code breaker called DJ( Benico Del Toro). He helps them at first when they are aboard the ship, but then turns out to be a backstabber for the Imperials. When he meets with Capt Phastma( Gwendolyn Christie). There Finn and Rose are shocked to find out he made a deal with her when he receive payment for their capture. Finn and Rose do all they can to escape and a battle takes place before they can meet up with Poe.Meantime, back at the Rebellion fleet Poe declares a mutiny when he doesn't like Holdo's plan. The Rebellion is unable to refuel and must flee to the nearest rebel base. Later when he talks to Leia this is the only way. The abandoned rebel base is on Crait. Crait is a iron rich salt covered planet, and once everyone is together they realize the Imperials are ready to fight with Imperial walkers and a huge cannon. Aboard one of the Imperial Walkers is General Hux and Kylo( Ben Solo) Ren. Ren who has mixed feelings about the light and dark side is now in charge since he killer Supreme Leader Snoke ( Andy Serkis). On the planet a huge battle begins not only with the rebels, but Kylo meets his nemeses Luke Skywalker. Luke appears to via the force to confront Ren. Then the Falcon arrives with Rey and Chewy. The Rebels need to find a way out of the base and Rey helps. Her Jedi powers are becoming more powerful. She is able to help them flee and escape in the Falcon. New relationships form in this sequel, when we see Rey notice Finn and Rose near the end , and Poe seems to be very interested in Rey now. Will there be one forming with them?In conclusion, I have been a die hard Star Wars fan since I was 6 yrs. old; but I have never given any a Star Wars film a 1 or 2 star review. For one I never compare the prequel/sequels to the originals; it would be a huge mistake. I have to agree in TLJ there were juvenile moments. For example, when Poe contacts General Hux, and toys with him, WTF? I will be frank with some U have to give Disney credit. In order to keep the Star Wars franchise alive they do have to target a younger audience, while trying to please the original fan base. It's hard, but that how you continue with cult classic films.I did enjoy some of the humor, the introduction of new creatures( the Porges, Crystal Foxes, and those horse like animal on Cardobit). The new planets were pretty cool too. If you think outside the box the story is not a complete failure. It didn't outdo The Force Awakes, but it still upstages the prequels ; which were 80% CGI. Now to me that is disappointing.",6,2,9,17 April 2018
Caddyshack," Caddyshack Scores
","I just watched this movie again last night. I keep forgetting this film gets better with age. It's been 34 years since it debuted in 1980. The first time I saw it I was very young, about 10. I watched it on T.V. of course it was cut; but you never forget your 1st comedy. I can't say anything negative about this film. The cast, plot, and scenery are-flawless. The movie begins on a plush golf course(Bushwood). It takes place in Nebraska, but the filming is done mostly in and around the Boca Raton area-Florida. You can tell this when we go to the yacht club in the movie. The movie begins where the viewer is introduced to this beautiful golf course in the morning. The sprinklers are on, and this gopher is tearing up the coarse. We also hear the song I'm All Right, by Kenny Loggins playing. The camera cuts and to a house in the city. The Noonan home, it is full of kids, and rowdy as ever. Danny (Micheal O'Keefe) is the oldest and is a caddy at Bushwood. His parents make sure most of his money, including his tips go into a jar, the college fund. Once he talks to his father; and eats breakfast he is off to work at Bushwood. Once at Bushwood we are introduced to the rest of the rowdy crew. Mel Loomis(Brian Doyle Murray) is the boss; and is perfect for the role. He is the straight boss that is cool; and if he likes you will let things slide. He is also one that likes to slack on the rules and you will notice that during the end of the film. Bill Murray(Carl Spackler) is a man on a mission. He is the Assistant Grounds Keeper. Carl is responsible for getting rid of this gopher. He tries everything, water down the holes, changing holes, and shooting it. Also in the movie are Ted Knight( Judge Smails), Rodney Dangerfield( Czervik), and Chevy Chase(TY), to name a few. The movie is about a Danny, who as a caddy needs a scholarship to help his parents pay for his college. Noonan tries to suck up to Judge Smails, for the caddy scholarship. We are then introduced to Rodney Dangerfield(Czervik). Who is a condo builder and his building just across from Bushwood. He is very funny and very obnoxious. As soon as he arrives, he and Smails get into it. Once the two are on the course Czervik bets him on everything when it comes to golf. Judge Smails soon realizes Czervik is his nemesis and a menace to the game of golf. Danny is a great caddy; and bonds with Ty. The two become quick friends, and Danny asks and takes Ty's advice when it comes to golf. The annual Caddy tournament is here and Danny wins first place. As the movie goes along Czervik and Smails get a bet going that gets up to 80 thousand dollars. Once the coarse hears about it, the bets are on. Ty hopes Danny will be his caddy, but draws Smails instead. As the game proceeds Ty realizes Czervik sucks at golf. It is time for a new plan, Czervik shoots his ball so the ball will come back a hit him right in the arm. Ty is down a partner and decides to draw Danny. Judge Smails looks at him for a decision, and Danny excepts Ty's offer. There goes the Caddy scholarship, but if Ty and Danny pull it off, he will not need it. As the game proceeds Ty and Danny tie it up. It comes down to the 18 hole and the pressure is on. Ty looks at Danny and says don't worry if you miss we lose. Danny shot comes up short, and Smails and the Doc. think they have it in the bag. The ball is on the very tip; and ready to drop. Just when the game should be over, but Lou keeps watching that ball. All of a sudden Carl uses the dynamite on the gopher. The ball drops into the hole, Ty and Danny get their revenge Smails. It's a party at Bushwood due to the outcome; but Carl doesn't get the gopher in the end. This movie has it all, Golf, The Murray brothers, big laughs, fun at the pool; and some hanky panky. It is a non-stop laugh-a-thon. If this movie doesn't bring a smile and laughs to you; please check your pulse. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",9,0,2,1 September 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Failsafe Is A Must For A Hal 9000.
","I just watched 2001-A Space Odyssey last night. I found this movie kind of weird; but cool in a way. I hope this makes since; and I know it changed how Sci-Fi movies were made from then on. This film was before my time so I guess that's why I found it somewhat strange. I think George Lucas got it wrong when he called Star Wars a space opera. This movie is a space opera to me, just because of the way it was filmed with classical music infuse with the dialog. I love most Stanley Kubrick films; and found this one interesting. The only problem I had with it was the beginning, Dawn of Man sequence, I thought it would never end. It's not like I didn't get it either, I did, the beginning of all things. I don't know if I am the only one that feels this was; but it was just a tad nerve wracking. The movie is good the whole journey into outer space amazing; and I bet back it 68 it was a mind-blowing experience. I found the movie start to peak when they uncover the Monolith on the moon; and the whole space station scene remarkable. When the Discovery mission left for Jupiter, that's when it started to get very interesting. When have the Discovery with a crew of 5 total, 3 in hibernation and to awake and monitoring the controls, etc.. Dr. Bowden and Dr. Poole think it's great to have a H.A.L. 9000 on board with them, what could be better. When H.A.L., informs them of a malfunction on the ship they go out and bring it in to repair. The problem begins when there is no problem, Poole and Bowden start to wonder. They begin to wonder about H.A.L.; and begin have a conference . They both go into a pod turn off the audio; and start to form a plan. They do not realize that H.A.L. can read their lips. Poole and Bowden want to disconnect him they do not trust him . This is where the viewer notices H.A.L.. H.A.L. begins to take over, kill the three remaining Astronauts by shutting down their life support systems. Then he sabotages Poole life support in space. Finally when Dave gets in, he shuts H.A.L. down for good. In the end when the Monolith gives us a laser like light show, was pretty cool. The ending I didn't quit understand unless the Monolith aged Bowden in someway. It could also be that maybe the Monolith was showing him the future. All in all I liked the movie; but I am more of a fan of 2010. I think 2010 explained it in more detail. It is a good movie and if U like Kubrick films you shouldn't be disappointed. Kris L.

Midsommar," A Total Insult To The Horror Genre!
","Wow! How did this movie ever get green lit, so bizarre. I rented this movie thinking it would be something like the original Wicker man-WRONG. The movie is too long, and if I were from Sweden I would be appalled. I would have rather watch paint dry than, watch this mess. If you enjoy watching a cult push their elders off a cliff when they reach a certain age, watch 2 people go at it while naked women chant, or group of women screaming at the top of their lungs, this is for you. Disgusting sex scenes in movies are lame, and I believe put in for a poor script. This movie was like watching some porno-PASS. It you want a good horror get a movie from John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Sean S. Cunningham, E.T.C.. Do yourself a favor and pass this piece of trash up, it should have been burnt.",2,12,19,11 October 2019
Groundhog Day," Groundhog Day Gives Phil Connors A Lesson On How To Become A Better Human Being
","The First Time I saw this movie, I thought it was weird. As I watched numerous times over the years, I love it. I think this movie has great lessons aimed to the viewer. We have Phil Connors (Bill Murray), a T.V. weatherman out of Pittsburg, P.A.. He will be going for the 4th time in a roll to Punxsutawney, P.A.. Along with him is Rita( the producer) for WPBH; and Larry(Chris Elliott). Phil hates covering the festival, and everything about it. He is hateful, obnoxious, paranoid, and somewhat of a snob. As soon as they get there, Phil can't wait to leave. He just wants to get the coverage, dehumanize his co-workers as well a some of the locals. Once they get the coverage start to leave a big snowstorm hits, closing down the highways. Once back in Punxsutawney, Phil starts to have a case of Deja Vu or so he thinks. The movie cuts and we see Phil in the bed at the bed and breakfast. The alarm goes off and he wakes to the Sonny and Cher song I've Got U Babe. He wakes as is usual self grumpy; and the radio is playing the same music, saying the same lines as the day before. He is stuck in Groundhog Day again and he's like W.T.F.. As the movie goes along he starts learning how to become a better human being, but the day will start over again if he fails to learn from his mistakes. As the movie proceeds we see Phil develop a romantic relationship with Rita, help a homeless man by bonding with him, take up piano lessons; and come to the aid of Buster( Brian-Doyle Murray)who was choking. This movie is about feelings, relationships, and humanity. This is a touching story, sometimes we forget how to treat each other with respect. To me this is not a romance movie; but a movie about human interaction.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",9,1,2,6 September 2014
Total Recall," Who Am I, Quaid or Hauser?
","This is one of those movies that can easily get you confused if U let it? Arnold Schwarzeneggar plays a Douglas Hauser/Douglas Quaid. We first see him on Earth with his wife Sharon Stone. Quaid is a construction worker who is wanting to take his wife on a vacation to Mars. She is totally against the idea and tells him he would hate it and tries to persuade him for a long trip to Saturn. He is fascinated with going to Mars, he ask one of his buddies about Rekall, a place where U can go and get a virtual vacation just like the real thing. His buddy, Carl, I think tells him no they will screw with his mind, and tells him of the story about a friend of his who was nearly lobotomize. Quaid ignores his so called wife and friend's advice a goes anyway. Once there he tells them he is interested in a trip to Mars, but the programmer also tries to talk him into some other virtual vacation. Quaid insisted a trip to Mars is what he wants.

Don't Breathe," Crime Never Pays
","In Detroit, Michigan three burglars are looking for the next big score. Rocky(Jane Levy), Alex(Dylan Minnette), and Money(Daniel Zovatto), are mostly small time burglars. They are usually successful, they are quick, and they mostly do a grab and go operation. Most of the homes are protected by a security system, that Alex's father works for. Alex is able to get the spare key to any home. Alex breaks in, and disarms the system before authorities are called.When Money hears about a new job from his boss he is all in and gets the others to join him. This is a step up from their usual jobs. The house is owned by a retired Iraq war vet. He is the last one on the block, and the area is a ghost town. To the crew this is a gold mine of a job; because the man won a huge wrongful death settlement. His daughter was hit and killed by a driver who was later acquitted of all charges. She got off because she comes from a wealthy family.When the three show up in the neighborhood, they think it will be easy. Money says to them no people, no 5-0 to deal with. The three survey the house and get the crap scared out of them by the mans dog. When Rocky notices the man(Stephen Lang) is blind, Rocky and especially Alex start to have second thoughts. Money on the other hand is the leader, so the others follow him. At first it looks like it might be an easy job for them. When they get in the house, what looks like a cake walk eventually becomes a fight for survival. When Rocky and Alex discover Money brought a piece with him; they both freak. Alex warns him of the consequences if they get caught, bigger charges and a bigger prison term. The blind man gets awakened when Money enters his room, a very scary situation. Money starts to back up, but it's too late. The man even though he lost his sight in Iraq, has developed his other senses well. He knows every inch of his home, hears every creak; and can sense if someone else is in a room. When things begin to go wrong, Money is the first one to get killed by the man. Due to his overconfidence and big mouth he gets shot by the blind man. The other two Rocky and Alex hide fearing they are next. When Rocky hides in the closet she texts Alex. Rocky also find the safe where the money is kept, and finds out the combo; when the man comes into the closet. The texts go back and forth; when they both find each other they decide it's time to get the money and split. They try to escape through the basement, only to find a shocking surprise. The woman who hit his daughter is chained up down there. Cindy(Franciska Tordesik) was kidnapped by the blind man. When Rocky and Alex free Cindy they decide to take her with them. The three think they are home free, when they reach the cellar door. When they open it they are confronted by the blind man. He opens fire thinking he got the robbers, but kills Cindy instead. He freaks out, and is very upset when he finds out Cindy was the one he killed. Now it's Alex and Rocky, they have to find a way to fight this psychopath in order to survive. It continues to be a cat and mouse game. When Rocky wakes up to find herself chained up in the basement she freaks. The blind man reason for this, is so Rocky can be a surrogate mother. He wants a child again, thinking this will make him whole. That's why he was distraught when he killed Cindy. She was pregnant with his child. Now Rocky has taken her place, he promises her she will be able to leave after nine months when the baby is born, like he promised Cindy. When he begins to impregnate her artificially, it backfires. Rocky gets free and gets him back, only to find out Alex was killed. She is the only one of the group to survive this hell.At the end she makes good on her promise to leave Detroit for California. She is at the bus station with her daughter when a news break comes on. There is coverage about the B&E she was involved in. When she notices the coverage the blind man has survived; and the reporters are making him out to be some kind of hero. Saying he fought for his life, killed the intruders, E.T.C .. This movie gives new hope for today's horror films. Stephen Lang is great as The Blind Man. He is really great at being an antagonistic character. I loved him as the evil brother in Fire Down Below, face it the guy can act. Don't Breathe is a creepy movie that is full of jumps and scares. Unlike many horror films this one lives up to the hype; and deserves the four star rating it got. I highly recommend it, you will definitely get your moneys worth in this little gem.Thanks, Kris L.

Joker," Just Call Me Joker!
","This movie is great, if Joaquin Phoenix is superb as Arthur Fleck-A.K.A. Joker. If he doesn't get an Oscar for best actor The Academy is truly a JOKE. I loved this movie because it combines the 89 Joker performance by Nicholson along with Ledger's Performance from The Dark Knight and roll them into one. Phoenix combines the two and creates his own psychotic individual that we will never forget.
The film is actually a tragic back story about Arthur Fleck, his early life and how he because the Joker. The film takes place in 1981 the Thomas Wayne( Brett Cullen) era. Gotham is in chaos and you were either the haves or the have nots. Bruce Wayne( Dante Pereira-Olson) is a youth and Fleck has a job as a clown. Fleck who lives with his mom Penny Fleck( Frances Conroy), is very unstable and has a medical condition which causes him to have laughing fits. He tries his best to fit into society and hates to be made fun of. All he wants is to be a comedian. He goes to the Murray Franklin( Robert DeNiro) show to study him. When Franklin calls him down to the stage he kinda gets made fun of, but laughs it off. His mother is very demanding, unstable, and tells him Thomas Wayne is his father. Which is untrue, Arthur was adopted by Penny . Penny worked for the Wayne's but was hospitalized in a mental ward for some time, and afterwards adopted Arthur. Like his mother he has also done time in the Gotham Asylum. When Arthur finds out the truth he begins to become more unhinged. After the death of his mother he becomes his alter-ego, dressing, putting make-up on, and dressing like a clown. He really losses it killing a co-worker and then going after Murray Franklin for making fun of him.
After each killing he become more violent, then he begins to draw a following. In the end Gotham is embroiled in complete chaos and Arthur Fleck is Gone, HE IS JOKER.
This is a great story about Flecks early life, and was mentally unstable from the beginning. It is a violent film, but I have seen worse. A story involving his time as an orphan, time in asylum, home life then into his downward spiral as the JOKER.",9,1,5,18 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Mustafar Battle And Some Special Effects Saved This Flim.
","I am a huge Star Wars fan been one since I was 5 back in 77, but for some reason the Prequels were disappointing. The problem I had with Revenge of the Sith was the acting. I was shocked by how Natale Portman( Padme) went from being somewhat tough in ATOC to some, wilted flower in ROTS. Anakin ( Hayden Christensen) acting ability was awful. It was awkward seeing him with Portman, no chemistry at all. This is worthy of a 6.5 rating but that is it. The movie begins with a battle over Coruscant, Anakin and Obi-wan are on a mission to save Chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mc Dermitt). Upon their mission both will confront Anakin begins to show more aggression when he is ordered to kill Count Dooku(Christopher Lee). After the return to Coruscant he reunites with Padme. She tells him she is pregnant, he looks surprised/ upset in away, then brushes it off. Anakin starts to have visions like he had of his mother, in ATOC. He explains to Padme about his visions that she dies in childbirth. He says he will do anything to prevent this from coming true. When the Jedi Council does not let him on the Council he throws a fix; and Obi wan sees his unstable behavior. He starts to get too close to Chancellor Palpatine and the Council sees this especially Mace Windu ( Samuel L. Jackson). Mace doesn't trust him at all. Meanwhile At the opera Palpatine explains the story of Darth Plagugeus. This gets Anakin, he will do anything to save Padme, he becomes Palpatine's new Apprentice Darth Vader. Anakin now belongs to the Dark Side, he kills young Jedi's in training, and neglects Padme. Obi Wan is now an enemy, who he will duel with on Mustafar. The Jedi are in one of the biggest battles, and Obi-Wai has to battle Anakin, and save Padme. During the duel of Mustafar, the Jedi are betrayed by The Clones turn on them, with Order 66 come through. We know Anakin turns to the DarkSide, Padme dies in Childbirth, and The beginning of construction on The Deathstar begins. This movie was saved by some veteran actors, McDiarmid, McGregor, and Jackson. The big plus is some special effects, and the Battle of Mustafar. It's the prequels, Lucas got them done, but it doesn't come close to the Orginals. THX,

Inception," Nolan Should Leave Sci-Fi Films To The Experts.
","I can't believe I wasted 6 dollars to see this movie at the theater. It was a waste of 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't know why this movie got so much praise, it's a pointless sci-fi movie that should have gone straight to video. I see some reviews say this movie was better than Star Wars, you have got to be kidding. Unlike Inception Star Wars had a great story, the actors even though unknown at the time impressed me; and the special effects-WOW. I must say Star Wars blows Inception out of the water still to this day. To anyone who doesn't think so must be too young to know that it took a lot more effort in the 70's to make a great film. I was really disappointed in Inception, I thought since Nolan did The Dark Knight movies this would be another success. This movie was slow, boring and really had no plot. The only thing I took from it was it was a dreams and getting into peoples heads in there most vulnerable time while they are dreaming. The ending was a WTF ending the kind that can make or break movies, but since this on was broken from the start the ending really didn't surprise me. To all who want to see a great sci-fi movie pick up the classic, like Alein, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Equilibrium, ETC.. I know from watching these movies and being a big fan of the SW saga, you won't be disappointed. Hey BTW, looking for a great TV Mini-series blockbuster from the 80's checkout V and V-The Final Battle, these movies are classics and I would recommend them to anyone who likes a great sci-fi movie.THX, Kris L.

Prometheus," When A Scientific Mission To Answer Questions About Our Humanity; Becomes A Doomed Voyage.
","Prometheus begins in the year 2089, when an archaeological crew discovers cave paintings in the Isle Of Skye, Scotland.This crew is led by Elizabeth Shaw(Naomi Rapace)and her husband Charles Holloway( Logan Marshall Greene).It is now the year 2093, and the scientific vessel Prometheus with her crew of 17 are headed to LV223. Among them is David( Micheal Fassbender), An Android, that Peter Weyland( Guy Pierce) created. Even though he is an android, he is strange; because he has emotional response. When the crew wakes from a long hyper-sleep they are greeted by Meredith Vicker's, Weyland 's daughter. She hired some of the crew herself. Among them are biologist(Mulburn), a geologist( fifield), security, Archologist( Shaw & Halloway), and flight crew. After waking and having dinner they are getting ready to set down and watch a presentation. The presentation is a two years old from Peter Weyland( Guy Pierce) who in 2091 the time was a centenarian; and now has passed. He explains more about their upcoming expedition. He has sent this crew of 17 to find humanities origins; and to find who actually created us. Afterwards Shaw and Halloway give their presentation on these cave paintings they found in 89; and compare them to other cultures from the past. Shaw believe these paintings are invitations from aliens they call Engineers.When they arrive on the moon LV223 it is very desolate, but discover something that looks like a cave. The crew gets a survey team together, so they can explore this find. Shaw, Holloway,David, Mulburn and Fiffield suit up and get ready to go. When they get there, Fiffield begins to map the structure with these survey balls. The data is sent back two the Prometheus so they can view their progress. While exploring they find out the cave is hollow, and it has an atmosphere. While the others are exploring, David finds a wall with symbols on it and opens up a archive hologram. The hologram shows these Alien Engineers running from something. These Engineers are a large breed, very muscular, and approximately 7.5 feet tall or larger. When they continue their trek, Shaw finds a fossilized Engineer that's been decapitated. It is approximately 2,000 yrs old. Fiffield and Mulburn decide they have had enough they are going back to the ship When the rest of the team continues they find a door, it opens; and numerous canisters are found with black organic ooze coming from them. Capt. Yanak ( Idris Elba) informs the crew they need to head back to the ship. Yanak has been informed a storm is coming. When they return they barely make it back due to this fast moving system. When they arrive at The Prometheus, Shaw has this head they found examined. When they examine it they discover it's not an exoskeleton. It is some type of helmet these Engineers use. All of a sudden Shaw realizes that Fifified and Mulburn have not returned and are stuck in the cave until the storm passes.
After this odd discovery on LV223 the crew of The Prometheus realize these Engineers are visitors just they are. Back on the ship David does an experiment involving Holloway and Shaw, with the organic material he found while out surveying with the others. David meets Holloway in a rec room, and with out him noticing drops it into his drink.Mulburn and Fiffield are still at the site, they come upon the room with the metal canisters. This time they are really oozing black material out of them. When they look around they find snake like creatures approaching them. These creatures seem like the primitive form of A FACEHUGGER. They enter Mulburn and Fiffield's body though their mouth. They are contaminated with this alien ooze just like Holloway is. After this happens they call for help. When Yank and other's try to rescue them and take them back to ship they begin to change along with Holloway. Vicker's refuses to let them board, they are contaminated; their bodies begin to morph into some kind of creature and then die.Shaw was one of the rescuer's and has to go through a bio-scan to see if she was contaminated. It negative on being contaminated, but she finds out she is pregnant. This is impossible because she is supposedly barren. David tell's her this is not an ordinary fetus and Shaw what's it gone. David has other plans she is to be frozen and returned to Earth for further study. When she is about to enter Cryo freeze, she fights herself free. She finds the nearest med-pod, performs abdominal surgery and removes it. It is some kind of squid like creature. THIS IS THE SECOND STAGE OF A PRIMITIVE FACEHUGGER.When Shaw finds Weyland had been hidden on the ship since the beginning , she's shocked. Weyland came to meet his makers, The Engineers. Shaw, David, Weyland, and other's return to the cave and find out it is really a ship. They find out these beings were headed to Earth to destroy it, with these biological weapons they started on LV223. The weapons are the material they found in those canisters, but something went wrong and it destroyed them. While there they also find an Engineer that managed to survive. When the being becomes hostile and turns on them, Shaw and Vicker's manage to escape.When Vicker's escapes she find Prometheus's life pod, but it end's up crashing. Shaw is lucky she has escaped, but in order to escape the planet she needs David's help. David tells her there are other ship's like this one and he know's how to operate them. She collects David's head and leaves.When the Prometheus begins to leave, Yanak tells Shaw what he is planing. He along with the other flight crew plan to do a Kamikaze with the other ship so it can be destroy with that stuff on it. Shaw not realizing the Engineer has escaped using a pod he follows her.When Shaw realizes she has 2 minutes of O2 left She returns to Vicker's Escape pod. There she discovers the creature she removed from and it survived,it is now six times the size. It fastens itself to the Engineer that followed her. She and David are on their way to another ship like the one they found. Shaw explains to David she wants to find out were these Engineer's are from and forgo returning to earth. She sends a message back two Earth telling them not to come to LV223. In the end a Xenomorph emerges from The Engineer's body. This is the beginning of it's rein of terror. A great movie, I can't understand why a lot of people disliked it",8,1,6,2 November 2019
Identity," Who Are You?
","When this movie came out I knew I had to see it, just by reading the back of the summary on the box. It already sounded like a winner, and it didn't disappoint either; plus with John Cusack U can't loose. The movie starts out with a last minute hearing on a convicted killer Malcolm Rivers. They are in a room reviewing the crime he committed several years ago. Then it goes to a desolate place in the desert, on a raining night. We being to meet the rest of the cast in the film. The story then begins with a crash, involving a car/pedestrian. This is where John Cusacks character comes in. In a remote part of Nevada, on a stormy night 10 people are stuck for the night. As the movie goes along the characters start getting bumped off. It's like a who done it and nobody trusts anyone, especially the convict that is among the group.Little does the viewer know that this is all playing out in Malcolm Rivers head, and these 10 people are all his identities. In order for him to escape the death penalty Malcolm must convince his doctor, judge, etc. that his treatment has worked and the killer is gone, so he can go into a state hospital , instead of being put to death. In the end they decide to take him into a state run hospital for the remainder of his sentence. In the end there's a twist that even got me. I recommend this thriller to anybody, you gotta C it; it doesn't disappoint. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",8,0,0,4 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nothing Will Beat The Originals, But The Force Awakens Beats The Prequels.
","It's been about 30 years since the Return Of The Jedi and the Battle Of Endor. The Force Awakens when one of the best Rebel fighter pilots, Poe Dameron(Oscar Isaac), visits Lor San Tekka( Max von Sydow) on Jakku. There he is presented with a valuable piece in finding the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker( Mark Hamill). It is a disc like piece to a map, when put together will lead to Luke Skywalker. Poe stores it safely in his BB-8 unit. Once he learns that The New Order will arrive on Jakku, he commands the droid to leave. Luke has gone into hiding ever since he trained a Jedi, that turned to The Dark Side. That Jedi is Kylo Ren( Adam Driver), who is now part of The New Order.When Ren Lands on Jakku, he has with him his head Stormtrooper, Capt. Phasma ( Gwendoline Christie), and her Stormtrooper patrol. Including FN 2187( John Boyega). Once Kylo learns that BB-8 has the piece leading to Skywalker, he orders the troopers to open fire on every villager. When FN 2187 sees this he is shocked and appalled. Poe Dameron is captured and taken aboard Kylo's ship to Starkiller base on the planet Myvath. Once they arrive, Capt. Phasma catches FN 2187 taking is Stormtrooper helmet off. She commands him to hand over his weapon for inspection. FN 2187 agrees and hands it over, then goes about his business. When he realizes Ren has Poe, he lies to Kylo and says Phasma needs the prisoner. Once he and Poe are face to face, Poe thinks he is with the Resistance, FN 2187 says he is breaking him out. Poe thinks he is with The Resistance, FN 2187 says no. FN has his own reasons for helping Poe and himself. FN 2187 leads him to the landing bay, and they steal a TIE Fighter. When he introduces himself to Poe, Poe says he is going to call him FINN. They escape to Jakku so Poe can get BB-8 back. When they escape they are pursued by TIE fighters, and they eventually crash land on Jakku. When Finn wakes up after the crash, he assumes Poe perished. He begins is journey on Jakku, first trying to get used to the climate, and find some much needed water. Rey a local scavenger is just trying to survive by selling scrap metal from ships that have wrecked. She sells them for food, when she discovers BB 8 following her one day. She tries to get rid of him, but when she finds out they only want the droid for parts, she keeps him. One day BB 8 spots Finn wearing Poe's jacket, that gets the attention of Rey who confronts him. When he explains to her what happens, she thinks he's with the Resistance. He tells her he has to get the droid back the Resistance so the map can be put together in order to find Luke Skywalker. They get reading to leave Jakku in a ship, but it gets destroyed. So they end up taking the Millennium Falcon. The ship Rey says is garbage until it's there only way out.On Star-killer Base a new Supreme Leader is in charge, Snoke( Andy Serkis). Kylo Ren reports to him, but Kylo is torn between the Darkside and Lightside. Kylo is having outbursts, he has Vaders mask and prays that the Darkside will completely take him over.

His mission is to find Rey, and confront her.On the Falcon Rey, Finn, and BB 8 realize they are getting boarded by another ship. Before they get boarded a major gas leak happens and they need to stop it. Once it's stopped they realize someone is coming aboard. It's none other than Han Solo( Ford) and Chewy( Peter Meyhew). Once they are aboard Rey and Finn can't believe it. They explain to Solo why they need to get the BB 8 unit back to the Resistance Outpost on . It is holding a piece to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Once the 5 team up they head to Maz's Cantina on Takodara. Maz ( Lupita Nyong'a). Once there strong bonds begin to form with the group. Two spies on each side report to their base that the BB 8 units is their. Rey eventually with Maz's help learns more about Luke and she eventually finds out Finn's true identity before she is captured. When the band of rebels find out the true power of what the Starkiller base can do, they can't believe it. It destroys multiple planets at once. Finn explains how important it is to stop the Starkiller Base for good. They travel to the ice planet of Myvath, they get Rey , but they lose someone along the way. In short the base is destroyed, the map is complete and the journey to find Luke Skywalker is complete.I don't understand all the hate toward this movie, it isn't that bad. I still believe it is much better than the pre-quels, which had way too much CGI. I also liked the way they included the wreckage from ROTJ's Imperial ship Avenger. It's something hard-core Star Wars fans picked up on right away. To those who haven't seen the film, see it. It is a great followup from ROTJ. I liked it much better than I thought I would, but nothing will beat the originals.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",8,3,19,23 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Long Time Ago, A Masterpiece Was Born.
","I first saw this movie when I was 6 in Dayton, Ohio. When that huge Imperial cruiser chases Leia's blockade runner through space, I was hooked. This movie changed movie making from then on. The special effects were mind blowing and people wanted to get lost in this magical universe.The story begins when The Empire ruled by Darth Vader( David Prowse)& voiced by ( James Earl Jones) find out that rebel spies have uploaded secret planes of the Imperial Battle Station. It's nickname is the Death Star; because it has enough power to destroy a planet. When Leia ( Carrie Fisher) hides the plans in R2-D2( Kenny Baker), she is wanted by Vader. R2 and his counterpart C-3PO( Anthony Daniels) immediately escape, by getting into an escape pod. The escape pod is bound for the planet of Tatoonie. In the meantime, Vader finds Leia, questions her; and she is immediately taken into Imperial custody.When the droids reach Tatoonie, they are found by Jawa's and hauled away in a droid transport. They are then taken to the Lars' homestead and sold. The Lars' Owen( Phil Brown) and Beru( Shelagh Fraser) are Luke Skywalker's ( Mark Hamill) aunt and uncle. Before dinner Luke is told to take the droids to get them cleaned up. While cleaning R2 he stumbles upon a portion of the recording. Luke wonders who the girl is in the hologram. 3PO explains she is someone of importance, that was on the fleet. When 3PO goes on about the Rebellion v. Empire Luke gets excited. All Luke wants to do is Leave Tatoonie and join the academy like his friends have done. At dinner Luke explains that the droid they bought might have been stolen. He tells his uncle Owen about them belonging to a Obi-Wan. When Owen hears this he gets upset, but then goes on about how Kenobi knew Luke's father. Afterwards realizing he has to stay oat home with his Uncle for another year, he leaves. When he returns 3PO tells him R2 has wondered off to find his old master. The next morning they search for R2 without telling Owen. When they search for him they realize they have to be careful. They are out beyond the Dune Sea where Sandpeople are everywhere. When he scouts, he is surprised by one and gets knocked out. Then they start trashing Luke's Landspeeder, until something scares them away.In the distance Obi-Wan Kenobi( Alec Guinnis) comes along. He checks Luke out and assures R2 his friend will be O.K.. When Luke wakes, Luke and Ben are talking about R2. When they finally remember 3PO they quickly head for his house where it's safer. When they are together R2 runs the complete recording. Ben tells Luke he must come with him to Aldderran. Ben will teach him the ways of the force. Luke rejects him saying he has to return home, but will take him to Anchorhead or Mos Eisley. When leaving Ben and Luke quickly discover disturbing facts about the Jawa's that sold the droids to The Lars'. Luke discovers that The Empire is on their way to Tatoonie for the droids. This news quickly gets Luke back home. When he returns he find the homestead is destroyed and Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru have been burned to death. When he returns back to tell Ben, Luke is going to Alderran with him.When Ben, Luke and the droids get to Mos Eisley they encounter Stormtroopers. Once there they need to find a pilot to take them to Alderran. At first, trouble ensues but Obi-Wan ends it quickly with his light-saber. Luke and Ben are introduced to Han Solo( Harrison Ford) and his co-pilot Chewbacca( Pete Mayhew). Solo will be taking them to Alderran and will be well paid for his services. When flying they realize there is a gravitational field but no Alderraan. Kenobi was the first to notice it, and Luke takes notice. It appears the planet has been destroyed by The Empire.The news is shocking they wonder why and how. On the way they discover what appears to be a small moon. When they get closer they discover it's no moon; but an Imperial Battle Station( Death Star). It is run by Grand Moff Tarkin( Peter Cushing) & most of the Imperial fleet is there. Then Han Notices they are being pulled in by it's tractor beam. They hide themselves in The Millennium Falcon's smuggling compartments; and come up with a plan. When Vader sends a scanning crew aboard, Han and Luke kill the troopers and take their places. Vader immediately senses Ben presence, he informs Tarkin. Meantime Han, Luke and the droids lock themselves in a control room. Luke tells R2 to plug into the stations security system/base. R2 informs the rest that Princess Leia is being held prisoner.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Adventure Continues, In The Empire Strikes Back
","Several years after the Battle of Yavin, Luke ( Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia ( Carrie Fisher) are back. Their friendship has grown stronger for one another; especially Leia and Han's. The Rebellion have found and formed a rebel base on the ice planet of Hoth. It seems to be going well, until an Imperial Probe Droid is dispatched out to the planet. It locates the rebel base, sends the report to Vader( James Earl Jones). Once the findings are complete the droid automatically self-destructs. The Battle of Hoth begins, with the successful flight of the first transport off of Hoth. Leia is reluctant to leave until Han says she has to go, he successfully gets her aboard the Falcon just in time. The fighting continues, but eventually dwindles down. The rebels tell Luke they will see him eventually at the rendezvous.
Luke has other plans he and R2( Kenny Davis) set a new course for the Degobah System. Once there Luke will track down Yoda( Frank Oz ) to begin his Jedi Training. Meanwhile, Han, Leia, Chewbacca( Peter Mayhew ), and C-3PO( Anthony Daniels )are having trouble trying to escape the Imperials. The Star Destroyer Avenger is right on their tail, along with a ton of TIE fighters right into an asteroid field. Han is slick he fly's through the field like a pro. He realizes he must find one that he can land on for awhile. As soon as he can, he moves close to this huge asteroid. It seems like they have found a safe place to lie low. The Millennium Falcon has taken a lot of hits and is in need of repairs soon. Han and Leia at times seem to be at each others throats, but deep down they strongly have feelings for one another.
On the Star Destroyer Avenger, The Emperor Palpatine( Ian McDiarmid), makes contact with Vader. He warns him of their new enemy, Luke Skywalker. Vader believes if he could be turned to the dark side he would be a powerful ally, a great asset. Luke's training on Dagobah is tough and sometimes turbulent. Yoda gives him advice, but Luke sometimes fails to listen. This is particularly noticeable when his X-Wing sinks deeper into the swamp and his failure through the cave. He is angry, feels hopeless, until Yoda talks to him more about the Force. Yoda proves his might by helping get Luke's X-Wing free, using his Jedi skills.
Han and Leia still stuck on the Asteroid, discover a terrifying fact. They are not on the asteroid, but inside a worm creature that dwells in the rock. They are able to get back on board and fly out just in time. As soon as they are free, they are met with enemy fire from TIE fighters and The Star Destroyer Avenger. Han turns the Falcon around, makes a bluff and proceeds into attack mode. Captain Needa( Michael Culver) on board the Avenger is shocked. The Falcon is there one second then gone. Upon seeing this , he realizes he has make a fatal error; and must report to Vader. The Falcon has docked aboard The Avenger until they can fly away undetected to a safe place. Han tells Leia the way they will escape is when the Avenger dumps it's trash, then we will float away undetected along with the rest of the trash. In the meantime they must search for a safe port to land, in The Onenid system. They find Bespin, which is home to Cloud City. Han is familiar with it's administrator, Lando Calrissian ( Billy Dee Williams). Inside The Avenger, Darth Vader employs a few bounty hunters to find the Falcon. A substantial reward await the one who finds it. Among them is Boba Fett ( Jeremy Bulloch). He is the Mandorolian, who vows to make good on Vader's promise. When the trash is released, The Falcon detaches; and heads for Cloud City, not realizing Boba Fett is behind them, in Slave 1.
Luke's is now training successfully, but it is suddenly interrupted when he sees visions of the future. He tells Yoda he must go and save them, but Yoda demands he must stay and complete his training. Luke promises he will return, and fly's off.
Once The Falcon arrives in Bespin Air space, the four are met with numerous Cloud City pod cars. They are authorizing them for a landing permit which they don't have. It gets a little uneasy, but finally they get permission to land. They are instructed to land on Platform A, I believe. Once they get out of the Falcon there is no one there to greet them-strange. This makes Leia very uneasy, and Han gets upset with her. A few minutes pass, finally Lando along with his trusted aide Lobot( Jack Hollis ) arrive. At first, it looks like it could be an angry reunion, but Lando welcomes them, especially Leia. While in Cloud City Han and Lando catch up on old times, Han tells Lando the Falcon needs repairs. Leia senses something is wrong especially when 3PO goes missing. When Han and Leia are alone waiting for Lando, she tells Han something just isn't right. When Chewy comes in he is carring C-3PO, he's been blown into parts. Leia hopes Chewy can fix him fast.
Lando comes in notices the droid and says something, but he wanted Han and Leia to join him in a refreshment first. Once they arrive to dine, the door opens up. There is Vader, Fett, and stromtroopers and they surround them. Lando said he had no choice but to turn them in, Lando was offered a deal to fix his own problems.When Han and Leia are held captive Lando tells the two, Vader doesn't want them; but Skywalker. Leia and Han realize they are bait and will experience torture while there. Vader tests the carbon freezing chamber on Han successfully. Han is frozen and given Fett. The chamber is reset for the Emperor's real prize- Skywalker. When the deal Lando made with Vader keeps changing for the worse. He realizes he must do something to save his friend, but it's too late. 
Vader gets news that an X-Wing is approaching, he tells the commander to allow Skywalker to land. Once Luke lands, he notices Leia. Leia Shouts it's a trap. Luke will find Vader confront him in a light-saber duel; and realizes the truth about Vader. It's up to Leia, Lando, and Chewy must conjure a plan in order to find Han.The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the original trilogy. It is packed with action, adventure, and a big surprise. I also thought that Bespin( Cloud City ) was awesome, along with the introduction of Boba Fett.",10,1,2,5 March 2018
Sin City," Sin City- Is Sinfully Awesome
","I never heard of the graphic novel Sin City. I just decided to watch the movie because it looked different. Sin City is a movie with a group of different stories that all tie in. The plot is different than what I am used to; but that's why it was such a hit with me. The opening is great Josh Hartnett as the man, he has an intro to Sin City. The opening story with Hartigan( Bruce Willis . An older cop forced into retirement due to a heart ailment. He and his partner Bob( Michael Madsen) are tracking down Roark Jr. ( Nick Stahl), who is a child molester. Once he and bob find him, Hartigan shoots him where it counts. Hartigan is a hero to Nancy(Jessica Alba), story is to be continued. The next story Marv & Goldie, I like to call it. Marv is a pill popping guy who is definitely on the rough side. He meets Goldie(Jamie King)who he loves. They spend the night together and when Marv wakes he realizes Goldie is dead. Marv runs to his parole officer because Cardinal Roark is letting him take the fall. The Cardinal is covering up for Kevin ( Elijah Wood). Kevin is a cannibal who dines on the flesh of the prostitutes of Old Town. Marv tells Becky, his parole officer what has happened. She explains to him who she thinks has done it, where, and who Kevin is related to. He meets Wendy( Jamie King), Goldie's twin; she thinks he is responsible for the murder of her sister. The two team up after Marv explains to he what happens. They head up to The Farm, a secluded house outside Basin City. Once there Marv kills Kevin and makes sure some of Kevin is left for the guard dog. The story fades and now we meet Johnny Boy( Benicio Del Toro). We arrive at Shellie's( Brittany Murphy). Johnny is banging on the door wanting in. Once he is in Johnny meets Dwight(Clive Owen), Shellie's new beau. The two get into a fight and continues into Old Town. In Old Town the streets are run by the hooker's, the girl's have a truce with the cops. Old Town is off limits to cops, pimps, and the mob. Johnny Boy and crew arrive looking for action. Dwight, Gail( Rosiaro Dawson) and the girls meet Johnny and crew, A.K.A. Det. Rafferty. A brutal Fight breaks out, killing Johnny and friends. When everyone find out who Johnny really is, an undercover cop, they realize the truce is threatened. They get rid of the evidence, but one of the girls has ratted them out. This is were the mob comes into play. In the end Old Town is saved, and Dwight and Gail are together again. We then return to part 2 of Hartigan. He wakes up in the hospital, we met Senator Roark(Powers Booth). He explains to Hartigan that they have taken care of all his medical bills, and cured his heart ailment. This is no good deed it will come with a price; so Senator Roark's kid will not be prosecuted for the crimes he has done. Hartigan gets out of the hospital; but Sen. Roark gets his way. Hartigan is beaten into signing a bogus confession on the child molestation charges. He is off to prison where he will be doing 8 years. Nancy faithfully sends him letters while there. We are met with Roark Jr. again; but he is transformed into some freak. They call him yellow bastard, due to his skin color. Sen. Roark tried to reattach his manhood back but instead all he got was side effects. He smells really bad like rotting garbage. Hartigan one day realizes he doesn't get a letter. He realizes 8 years is gone by meets the parole board and is out. Once out he vows to find Nancy to she if she is O.K.; and little does he know yellow bastard is right on the trail. Hartigan goes to Nancy's apartment and realizes it's been broken into. He notices on a table a set of matches from a bar and goes there. He walks in and discovers Nancy is a dancer, she doesn't want her to see him. They both find each other and she is so happy to see him. Yellow bastard is in the bar and wants to finishes what he started 8 years ago but never got to finish. Yellow bastard kidnaps Nancy and Hartigan is right behind him, back to The Farm. Once Hartigan finds Nancy at The Farm he kills yellow bastard, then pulls the trigger on himself. The closing of the movie Josh Hartnett in a hospital elevator with closing words. In Conclusion this is a great film. I am looking to get the extended cut soon. I recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan, comic fan, or basically anybody. This movie is a guaranteed winner.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",9,2,3,29 August 2014

V for Vendetta," A Glimpse Into The Future, Maybe.
","I just watched this movie the other night, and it was amazing. The beginning starts off with the words, Remember, Remember The 5th of November. This is the time period around the mid 1600's that Guy Fawkes plan to blow up Parliament failed. He was captured along with his cohorts. He was taken to the gallows and hung for his crime. Once we see Fawkes hung we are take some four hundred years into a Fascist England. I would say the year in the film is around 2020. We meet Evey a young lady watching a Totalitarian T.V. show, the host Deitrich. He is explaining why England is in the state it's in due to all the war's the, homosexuality, the disease, ETC.. Evey is in her Uncle's apartment, she turns and looks at the clock and notices she is past curfew. While walking home she gets caught by the secret police. They rough her up and try to rape her. V who is an anti- hero in the movie comes to her rescue. He is wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, he saves Evey by killing the men with the knives he carries. He ask if she is hurt, and from then on it seems the two form somewhat of a bond. It is like Evey is his protégé. She is loyal; but she keeps her guard up around him, like his he a friend or foe. She is or to me like his prisoner at first; but more of an ally as the movie proceeds, especially near the end of the movie. Since this is in the future 2020/2030, we realize in the beginning the United States does not exist anymore. There are wars, plagues,; and fascist rule is the norm in Britain. Evey and V get to know each other better and she finds out by accident he was horribly burned. V explains his past to her, about Larkhill prison. A place where criminals and undesirables where housed. They suffered inhumane treatment, pawns in awful experiments, then dumped in mass graves. He was lucky to escape due to a fire and vowed to get his revenge on those who worked there. One night Evey is watching the news and hears about the murder of Deitrich. Then asks V if he was responsible, he says yes. The vengeance begins, and V strikes back leaving a rose at each murder scene. Even after this happens Evey proves her loyalty to him. She gets kidnapped and held as a prisoner. Little does she know that V is responsible for the kidnapping. While being held prisoner she finds a note written by a young woman who was a prisoner at Larkhill. Evey reads it explains about her lesbian relationships and how family and society treated her. A relationship that grew despite the backlash from parents and society. The secret police found out and got her partner first, then came for her. Evey's loyalty continued for V, even while being locked up. When she was able to escape she finds out V in living in the basement/lockup of Larkhill. She is upset at first thinking the whole thing was a hoax. The note was true the girl was the prisoner next to him. She learns a lot from his past by this time, and is more than an ally. In the end, they track down V, even though V dies his plan to blow up Parliament gets carried out by Evey. This is a great anti-hero movie. The cast was great and because of the plot I am glad there wasn't any backlash towards the movie. I am surprise no one in England complained about it, the Government. Even though I didn't care for The Matrix, I loved this gem of a movie. This film has it all, comedy, tragedy, suspense, and action. This is a great movie that balances out the yin and yang, you will not be disappointed. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",9,1,3,28 November 2014
