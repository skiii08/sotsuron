The Avengers," amazing
","the avengers is a brilliant take on the marvel comic series that were made in 1964. the avengers is worth watching i can say money well spent.A war breaks out on earth and its good vs evil as the avengers battle for the fate of the earth.The avengers is a epic film which is one of the if not the best comic book movie.it made records taking in $623,279,547 beating harry potter and the deathly hallows.it was shocking that the avengers did so well as it was partly a Disney film and people thought it wouldn't do well.the avengers was one of the blockbusters of 2012 beating others like the dark knight rises and the amazing spider- man.the avengers is overall a brilliant film and i recommend that everyone should watch it.",10,1,7,13 March 2013
