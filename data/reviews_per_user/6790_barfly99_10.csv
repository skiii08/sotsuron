The Blair Witch Project," Flawed but clever, and provokes amusing criticism
","TBWP has many flaws - the implausibility of some of the characters' behaviour, the irritation factor of watching people bicker for an hour, and so on. That said, it is an interesting little film with some clever touches (the interviewee's child covering her mother's mouth; the handprints in the house etc.). Scary? Not really, but then that couldn't be more subjective could it? THE EXORCIST had some people vomiting in the aisles yet it doesn't scare me at all (but the reverse could be true of another film). Anyway I personally I give TBWP six out of ten. What I find hilarious is the nature of the criticism this film has received since its release, which is almost as OTT as the hype that preceded it.Most of those people who insist that is the worst film ever made are as one-eyed as those who said a year ago that it was the best. I notice that the early comments on the IMDb were nearly all hysterically complimentary, and now they're nearly all hysterically savage. There's nothing like a good bandwagon to jump on is there? (Or did the film suddenly metamorphosize from a classic to a turkey sometime last autumn?) This isn't the worst film ever made; there are countless worse (see the IMDb's own '100 worst' list for some prime examples). Harbouring unfettered resentment at the film-makers because you've seen an over-hyped movie is hardly a platform for objective criticism. If anyone had seen a film of this standard on late night TV and not cared for it they'd have turned it off and forgotten about it, and certainly not worked themselves into a frenzy about how awful it was. I particularly enjoyed reading the comments of those BWP-haters on here who remarked upon the 'suckers' and 'idiots' who actually watched it (can you spot something of an own goal here?).The oft-repeated refrain that this film is 'cheap' and 'amateurish' beggars belief. Since it was made cheaply by then-amateurs, was hyped as a cheap film made by amateurs, and purports to be a cheap documentary made by amateurs, I would have thought its cheapness and amateurishness was rather to be expected. Given that the protagonists are supposed to be making little more than a home movie, the complaint about the jerky camera movements in this context is especially absurd - or would you have Heather & Co. set up dollies, cranes, and so on as they flee through the woods? If you've automatically got it in for this style of film-making (and you'd have to have been on Mars not to have known how TBWP was shot) why go and see it?THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has actually gone up in my estimation because it's reminded me of the power of movies to provoke the audience, and the public reaction to this film has been priceless. My absolute favourite comment I keep reading is 'I could have made this!' Well since it cost next to nothing and those who made it are now multi-millionaires, why the f*** didn't you?",6,1,2,30 May 2000
American Psycho," Hilariously vicious satire of the 1980s.
","So let's get this straight: AMERICAN PSYCHO is pornographic and horrific, but also not shocking enough; it's dull and boring, but also overly brutal and disgusting; it crams in too much of the novel, but also not enough. Films like this just can't win when so many people insist on going to see it with such deeply entrenched expectations of exactly what kind of film it ought to be, rather than judging it on its own terms. Surely it is beyond serious dispute that Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is as compelling as you could possibly hope to see. And some moments (notably the business card scene and Patrick's meditations on various MOR musicians) are extremely funny. I can understand the gore putting off some people, but it's actually no more gory than, say, GOODFELLAS, and nobody ever seems to imply Scorsese ruined that film with graphic violence. And I find it astounding that a film that gets its point across so determinedly can be labeled 'pointless'. The portrayal of a decade of image without substance, riches without work, sex without love, and so on, represents, I would have thought, a pretty forthright 'point', whether you agree with it or not. The film's closing monologue is merely a final reminder that sincerity has no place in a world so vacuous and empty. For me one of the funniest and most telling moments in AMERICAN PSYCHO is when Willem Dafoe, who had previously appeared to be the typically astute screen detective, turns out to be just another grinning Huey Lewis fan - perhaps with dark thoughts and urges of his own. I for one will certainly be extra careful with the next person I hear raving about Phil Collins.",9,0,1,15 May 2000
28 Days Later...," Exciting but derivative and unpleasant post-apocalyptic thriller
","28 DAYS LATER does not, as some seem to believe, herald some kind of rebirth for British cinema. This is in fact the latest entry in a very old and well-trodden genre, and the fact that it is set and made in Britain rather than the US for once doesn't mean its complete lack of originality should be conveniently overlooked. Having said that, it is slickly and stylishly done, and contains enough thrills and spills to keep you reasonably entertained throughout.It doesn't start well. If there really are high-tech laboratories housing diseases capable of causing the mayhem 'Rage' does, I doubt very much that their security system is so lax that they can be penetrated by a few animal rights activists.But the scenes of a deserted London are chillingly effective, and when the real action starts, as we first encounter 'the infected', the film's pattern becomes clear. Although we have seen this kind of thing many times before, the one interesting twist Boyle and Garland add to the mix is that unlike Romero's zombies, Star Trek's Borg and so on, the fearless, unrelenting stalkers here don't plod slowly and rather pathetically toward their intended prey, but sprint at top speed. This makes the action sequences considerably more tense and breathless than one might have expected.Furthermore Boyle's directorial flair is such that even when the story moves out of London the screen is repeatedly filled with dazzling, memorable images. There's some good use - although it might be considered overuse - of music, and most, if not all, of the performances are good, thanks to the casting of solid, reliable types like Christopher Ecclestone and Brendan Gleeson in many of the key roles.But unfortunately Boyle and Garland don't know where to stop. The unpleasantness and/or stupidity of everyone in the film is as ceaseless as the pursuit of them by the infected. Most of the scrapes Jim and co. get themselves into are entirely of their own doing, and those that aren't turn out to be because the uninfected are basically as nasty as the infected. After a while you begin to think that us Brits are all apparently so moronic or amoral that the rest of the world would probably be better off if we did all get wiped out. The likes of THE OMEGA MAN are generally not exactly a barrel of laughs either, but at least those films made you want humanity to survive.28 DAYS LATER is worth seeing, just about, and as pure white-knuckle entertainment goes it's probably at least as good as the average star-studded Hollywood blockbuster.Now if only we could do it with more interesting and original material...",Null,0,0,10 November 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Dazzling but totally empty...
","It is a depressing indictment of Hollywood that a film such as MOULIN ROUGE is apparently considered to be one of the best films to emerge from Tinseltown in recent years. Visually it is certainly fantastic, and - assuming your taste is very much in the mainstream - it must have value in purely musical terms. But it is also a soulless and in my mind rather cynical film, and one that demonstrates contempt for many fundamentals of good cinema.The cinematographer, choreographer, special effects team and so on should all be congratulated for some dazzling work. Indeed I'm sure many of these people will be nominated for Oscars. And so they should be. However the plaudits should end there.Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it customary for a fictional film drama (whether musical or otherwise) to have a story and/or some characters? MOULIN ROUGE's lame excuse for a 'story' is in fact revealed in a Ewan McGregor voice-over in the first reel of the film. There are no twists, no surprises, no sub-plots...in short it is feebly, depressingly, almost mind-numbingly predictable from first minute to last. Characterization fares no better, with no hint of personality detectable in any of the protagonists (the Duke comes closest by at least being a caricature - MacGregor, Kidman, etc don't even get that). This is truly one of the most lazily written films I have ever seen.Of course it could be quite reasonably argued that the very same criticism could be leveled at all sorts of films, and that is true enough. However MOULIN ROUGE has the breathtaking temerity to purport to be about 'truth, beauty, freedom, love'. It could not have chosen grander themes, and could not have made a more pitiful attempt at exploring them. In fact the film is so wretchedly written that at absolutely no point does it ever, even once, make a sincere effort to engage the audience on an emotional or intellectual level. Of course the renditions of 'Your Song' might have brought a tear to the eye to some, but if so then the credit is due entirely to Elton John, and no more due to Baz Luhrmann than it is to a radio DJ who plays it on Heart FM or whatever. The great musicals, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, TOP HAT and so on did actually bother with an involving and emotive screenplay between numbers. CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG had more of a script than this.MOULIN ROUGE is the product of someone being given a lot of money to make a big crowd-pleasing movie, and him making it without actually having anything whatsoever to say. To me a great cinematic spectacle comes from having an idea and building a film around it; not from hiring some big stars, spending the GDP of a small country on SFX, and then rather grudgingly putting a story and some characters in it as an afterthought.If you are attuned to its humour then I can see how this could be a fun movie to watch, but if you expect something more than an extended MTV video for your time and money, it's a wearying and ultimately rather insulting film. MOULIN ROUGE isn't - even for one second - about truth, beauty, freedom, or love. It's about making as much money as possible for the people behind it.",2,1,2,21 October 2001
Jerry Maguire," Tiresome and poorly-made, an overrated 'feel-good' bore.
","Far from being the wryly amusing yet heart-warming tale it claims to be, this is an annoying and embarrassing mess, and seemingly aimed at particularly dense 9 year-olds. Cruise is neither charming nor sympathetic in this movie, he's just boring. Cuba Gooding Jnr isn't boring, but that's just because he's prodigiously irritating. Whatever happened to those fantastic sports comedies they used to make like SLAPSHOT and THE MEAN MACHINE (aka THE LONGEST YARD)? Superficial rubbish like this should go straight to video, and certainly shouldn't be depriving far, far better films of Oscar nominations.",2,20,45,20 May 1999
Groundhog Day," Wonderful piece of heart-warming comedy
","Like many others, I still find it staggering that this film was not given even the slightest consideration as Oscar material. It is not as if GROUNDHOG DAY were only a lightweight romantic comedy. It *is* exceptionally funny, the perfect vehicle for Bill Murray's sardonic wit, but like Frank Capra's work (which this film most closely resembles) there is great depth and a message here. Phil Connors' journey from cynicism and vanity to humility and redemption may be a touch whimsical, but it is also touching and finally uplifting. Like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (another film robbed of Oscar recognition), you can watch it again and again. And again. And again...",10,1,2,17 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A very good film, although only an average Kubrick film
","Of course people compare this to Kubrick's earlier work, and dwell on his past reputation - the man was an undisputed genius! That doesn't mean the faults of this film should be overlooked, and nor were they, as I recall, by the critics or the public upon its theatrical release. Yes, it is overlong, slow, and at times rather pompous. Alice is so unpleasant that you wonder what on earth nice Dr Bill would see in her. And the incorporation of the thriller element into the plot is sometimes rather unconvincing. But the cinematography IS amazing (though its impact much diminished on the small screen), the orgy scene at the very least memorable, and Cruise's performance outstanding. And of course the funny bits are supposed to be funny! (Could the scene with Cruise and the hotel clerk POSSIBLY be intended otherwise?) Not among Kubrick's very BEST work, but still an immensely intelligent, compelling, and original piece of cinema.",8,0,1,23 April 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," (Don't) grow up, petty critics! Enjoy this fun movie!
","First of all I have to say I haven't yet read J K Rowling's books, so I am in the apparently unenlightened position of not feeling it necessary to compare this film to the books. But since this is, as I understand it, a *film* internet database, I would hope that this puts me in a better position than many of this film's critics here. Might I make a token suggestion to those who write reviews on this site (with AMERICAN PSYCHO, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, and - no doubt - THE LORD OF THE RINGS in mind) to judge a film as a film, not as an adaptation of a book. By all means mention a film's faithfulness or overall quality in relation to its source material, but please don't define that as whether or not it is a good or bad film. Believe it or not, some people went to see HARRY POTTER who hadn't read the book. Does the quality of APOCALYPSE NOW make Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' a bad book? Does the dreadfulness of CHILDREN OF THE CORN (and its innumerable sequels) make Stephen King's original short story the greatest literary work of all time?What I saw when I went to see this film was not a masterpiece or work of genius. But it was a fun, exciting, and immensely enjoyable family film. Although it was perhaps overlong (a good twenty minutes could probably have been snipped without any damage to narrative or characterisation), it was charming and witty and engaging all the way. The SFX were no better or worse than one might have expected, but the sets and costumes were outstanding, with a real feel for England and the public school ambience that Hogwarts seemed to represent. John Williams' score was also memorable.The main criticism I had of the film (and, aside from the length, the *only* substantive criticism that I can see if you forget the books) is that some of the acting by the children was a bit ropey on occasion, even by young Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. But fortunately the likes of Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Ian Hart, John Hurt, and Alan Rickman keep it well above sea level. It is certainly not a ground-breaking or life-changing film in any way, but anyone who has an open mind and open heart should enjoy this exuberant and good-natured magical adventure.",Null,0,0,26 November 2001
The Green Mile," A poignant, wonderfully performed supernatural drama
","Those who complain about the length of THE GREEN MILE should count themselves lucky that there are some film-makers around willing to put faith in their work and its value rather than fob you off with 90 minutes of the usual over-edited dross. And though I accept that there's little in the film that hasn't been done before, there's also little in it that has been done better. Although not as cohesively structured as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE is that wonderful film's equal because it explores evil and injustice in a more telling and confrontational manner. So what if all the bad characters are EXTREMELY bad? Would more morally ambiguous characters have really served the thrust of the story? One of the film's strengths is its simplicity both in story and character. A movie as touching and marvellously acted as this deserves nothing but praise.",9,0,0,10 April 2000
Casino Royale," Exciting and well made... but not really a Bond film
","So Bond is back. Except this is Bond Year Zero. Bond Rebooted. Bond: The Beginning.In this loose adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel - the first to feature James Bond - Daniel Craig stars as 007 just as he has gained 'Double-0' status by chalking up two kills (and we see the kills in oddly film noir style black-and-white). After a debut mission in Madagascar goes awry, Bond is assigned to play a high stakes poker game with terrorist financier Le Chiffre, knowing that winning the game will bankrupt Le Chiffre, and losing it will mean Her Majesty's government directly funding terrorism...The bloody and breathless chase in Madagascar immediately informs us that this is not Bond as we've known him before, but a raw and uncompromising version. Craig doesn't even look remotely like any other Bond, with his dirty blonde hair, rugged features, and rippling, hairless muscles (which the film-makers' deem it necessary to show off at every opportunity). Emotionally he is completely different too. This Bond is not indestructible and cool under pressure, but volatile and vulnerable, even falling rather quickly in love with Eva Green's Vesper Lynd, who is sent to the Casino Royale with Bond to keep an eye on the money he is gambling.The action is relentlessly exciting, with several brutal fist-fights, a truly spectacular car crash, and eventually a collapsing Venetian house. The performances are also universally very good. Judi Dench is rather incongruously brought back to play the morose M, Eva Green is an enigmatic Bond girl, and Mads Mikkelson does as much as he can with a thin role as Le Chiffre. As for Craig, he can definitely play the back-to-basics, street-fighting man this Bond is apparently supposed to be - certainly at least as well as you would have expected any other actor to have played him.The trouble is that this film never really looks or feels like a Bond film. There is no Moneypenny, no Q, and there are no gadgets. The theme tune is entirely forgettable, and John Barry's famous Bond music is shunned until the final credits. Le Chiffre, an asthmatic banker, makes for a rather pathetic super-villain, and there are no colourful henchman for Bond to duel. Bond himself is dismissed by M as just a 'thug' early in the film, and he proves her right throughout, with little charm or wit to complement his undoubted talent for beating people up without the slightest concern for civilians and innocent parties who get in the way. He doesn't even 'give a damn' if his vodka martini is shaken or stirred.In fact the film appears more closely modelled on the Jason Bourne franchise than previous Bond films. Whilst I appreciate the need to renew and reinvent 007, I question the need to rob from Bond almost every single ingredient that made him such a success in the first place. If we want a series of films about an MI6 hooligan that's fine, but why not create a new character altogether? Interestingly 007 does by the close of the film utter the famous words, 'The name's Bond. James Bond.' Perhaps this is to signify that this film is just an introduction to the all-new Bond, and that the panache will re-appear in future films.In the meantime CASINO ROYALE makes for a thrilling preamble. But be warned that it doesn't have much more in common with the official 20 Bond movies that preceded it than the farcical 1967 adaptation with Peter Sellers and Woody Allen.",7,0,2,18 November 2006
