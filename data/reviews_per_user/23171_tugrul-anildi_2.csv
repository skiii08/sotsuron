Come and See," Comic-strip villains (half-)punished like in Hollywood
","First part of the film was promising to display some fine intricate human feelings, both characters being out of balance in different ways. The forest scenes with birds and rain were quite good, contrasting with the violent war and threat of death to both children. The island where villagers gathered and cow-stealing scenes were still promising.But then; a super-villain a la James Bond films enters the scene and does everything to provoke hatred in watchers using very coarse methods (killing people and laughing&eating lobster,...). When film watchers see this much inhuman villainy, they are bound to be shocked. One of the starting characters reappear at the end with blood dripping down her legs, this time to serve the hatred of the watchers.The villains beg for mercy at the end, accuse each other to escape death, lower themselves even further in the eye of the watcher. Final scene is a symbolic return to the childhood of Hitler, in her mother's arms (and not sympathetic even then) before everything. All in all; promised a lot but ended like many other Hollywood war/revenge-of-the-innocent movie except that revenge was partial here if that is what makes an art film.",7,1,8,30 September 2014
Barry Lyndon," nice but superficial
","Definitely not a masterpiece if we must do justice to movies deserving the title. First of all, Lady Lyndon has absolutely no character even a superficial one. We have no notion of her feelings towards her husband and her second son. Secondly, the main character has no dilemmas, conflicts not even a soul. Thirdly, the story consists of disconnected parts without aim. Fourthly; Barry's mother reappears as a lady after disappearing as an ordinary villager at the start of he movie. There are many other weaknesses besides these. The result is a historical setting, carefully set-up scenes, some good music but no content. Can not be compared with other Kubrick movies such as The Shining and 2001",7,2,5,29 December 2013
