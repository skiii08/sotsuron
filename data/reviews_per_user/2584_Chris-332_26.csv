Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fun and awesome movie, yet some flaws.
","Star Wars: Episode 1 has absolutely fantastic battle scenes with the mind-boggling CGI effects. Any other movie can't even come close to the special effects and the action packed scenes. Yet, of course, there are flaws. Like those stupid midi-clorians stuff. What was George Lucas thinking!? Or the horrible acting by Jake Lloyd. Or the character Darth Maul, who was the most pointless mistake of a villain. He was in what, 4 scenes, maybe 5? Yet as you're watching the movie, though, you forget all that. I am a Star Wars maniac, and I put Star Wars on a very high level above 'normal' movies. Yet when I saw Phantom Menace, I didn't expect it to be on that same level because when Star Wars came out, there was nothing ever like it before. Now every sci/fi movie wants to copy it, so when a new Star Wars comes out, you think, ' oh i've seen that in every other sci/fi movie.' But that's not George Lucas's fault. It's not his fault that every futuristic action adventure wants to be like Star Wars. I also didn't expect it to have the impact as the first one did. I expected it to have the impact as Return of the Jedi. I also disagree with the critics saying it has no human magic. It does, yet you concentrate so much on the visuals, that you sort of forget about it. But it's there, isn't it? All in all, Episode 1 has many flaws, but so did the other ones. It is a fun experience that fits very well with the other Star Wars movies. Only one thing, how come Jabba the Hutt hasn't gotten fatter from Episode 1 to New Hope ( which is 35 years later) and blows up like a blimp from New Hope to Return of the Jedi (which is, what, 6 years later?)",1,0,1,27 May 1999
Meet the Parents," Absolutely a Riot!
","Meet the Parents is the funniest movie of the year, no questions asked! Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller are absolutely HILARIOUS! I knew I would love this movie from the very beginning.This movie works on so many levels. Not only is the movie absolutely hilarious from start to finish, it also has a lot of sad and touching elements. Ben Stiller is great as the unfortunately named Greg Focker (who does resemble his character in There's Something About Mary a little too much) and Robert DeNiro is fantastic as Jack Byrnes, a would-be father-in-law from Hell. DeNiro is much better in this movie than his terrible role in the atrocious Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle simply because he is more relaxed and has much more fun with this character. Stiller and DeNiro make such a good team in this movie, also. Both of them make the perfect reactions to all the absolutely humiliating mishaps Greg does in the movie. All the horrible things Greg does, from losing DeNiro's dear cat to breaking a girl's nose to setting the house on fire, none of them would have been as funny as they were if DeNiro didn't do such a good job reacting to the accidents when he would find out about them. And some of the scenes (Greg saying grace at the dinner table and the fabulous interrogation scenes) are absolutely IMPOSSIBLE not to scream out laughing.And although the movie does have a little too much in common with There's Something About Mary, it still has all new laughs that are very fresh and are absolutely a riot!",10,0,0,9 October 2000
Batman Returns," A good sequel to a great movie.
","Batman Returns is probably the best sequel to a comic book/action movie. Tim Burton once again captures the audience, now having Batman have to fight off two villains, instead of one. The Penguin is a great villain, and Danny DeVitto really delivers, yet not as much as Jack Nicholson in the original, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a phenomenal performance as Selina Kyle, a secretary who goes crazy and becomes the Catwoman. Burton's vision of Gotham City succeeds once again at making the audience believe it is a quirky, crime infested town. Though some scenes are cheesy, such as the fact that Catwoman instantly learns how to fight better than Batman himself, you still are captured in the feeling that this movie, like the original, is not a movie just to entertain kids with their favorite good guys, like how Joel Shumacher's vision did. The stunts and special effects in this movie are also great, so you do get some visual excitement, too. I also like the fact that Bruce Wayne falls in love with a villain. All in all, this was the last good Batman movie.",10,0,0,14 August 1999
Dead Poets Society," One of my favorite movies!
","Dead Poets Society is an absolutely marvelous film. It is a true gem. The story is one of the best stories that appeared on the silver screen. Robin Williams did a fantastic performance as Mr. Keating, a teacher at a boarding school who gives inspiration to his classmates to have a mind of their own and to love poetry and other forms of creativity. The kids in his class think he's more than a teacher, and as the movie goes on it shows how the kids need his help with their own problems, and how Keating has a problem of his own that is a major tragedy to the kids. The kids also discover that he was part of a group called the Dead Poets Society where they sneaked out of the High School Boarding School and go to a cave where they read poetry to each other and let it drip from their tongues, like honey. The kids decide to start the group up again themselves, so they go out to the cave, where they read poetry. That's when one of the kids does a very stupid thing which gives away their secret to the school. Not only does this effect their lives, but Mr. Keating's as well. Don't think that this movie is all inspiration. It has many tragedies involving the kids' personal problems. The whole movie fits so well together with all the different stories in it, I have to respect director Peter Weir A LOT! Although Robin Williams does a fantastic performance, Ethan Hawke's character, Todd, was my favorite in this masterpiece. This is definitely up with Gattaca and the Star Wars series as my favorite movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes drama movies. It is a definite masterpiece!",10,0,0,18 July 1999
Ed Wood," The best Tim Burton movie ever.
","Being a really big Tim Burton fan, I can't say it's easy to pick which one is the best. Edward Scissorhands had the emotion, Beetlejuice had the comedy, Batman had the quirkiness, Sleepy Hollow had the visual scenery, and so on, and so on. But I still think that one movie stands out when I think of Tim Burton's movie. That movie is Ed Wood. The movie is a total masterpiece! The screenplay was hysterical. The acting was superb. The music was great. The directing was amazing. Every single thing that could be cool in a Tim Burton movie is in this movie! The two actors that stand out for me in this movie is, of course, Johnny Depp, who gave an incredible performance as the worst director of all time, and Martin Landau, who was outstanding as the late horror icon Bela Lugosi.The mostly true story is about Edward D. Wood, Jr., who made such atrocities as Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster, and Glen or Glenda. He was awarded, after his death, an award for the worst director of all time. The movie is about his life and his journey to become a great movie director. Through his years he befriends Bela Lugosi, Crizwell, and many other '50's icons. Ed also has a problem, a problem his girlfriend (sarah jessica parker) has never known about. He's a transvestite! He likes to wear woman's clothes.The movie, although a comedy, had some dark Tim Burton moments aswell as a lot of drama in it. It fit so well together that the movie is overwhelming. I'm so glad that a large amount of critics also thought the same about this movie. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are great, nominated Martin Landau for an award, and everyone else in the movie is great to, such as Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Patricia Arquette. Tim Burton really made a movie that could top all his other works. 2000 on a 10 point scale.",10,0,0,4 December 1999
X-Men," A Great Blend of Action, Effects, Story, and Characters.
","I have never been a fan of X-Men in my life. The characters always seemed dumb in the cartoon series on Fox Kids, and I've never read the comics of it. I wasn't very psyched that that they were making an X-Men movie, but then I found out that Bryan Singer was directing it. That seemed very interesting, because Usual Suspects and Apt Pupil (both great films) had little to no action in them. Then I also found out that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were starring in it, along with a bunch of young actors with no really major credit (besides Anna Paquin with The Piano). That got me more interested, and once I saw the preview I knew I had to go see this movie. I'm glad I did. X-Men has so much to offer in an hour and a half, and as I was sitting there watching Toad walk on walls, Professor X use Cerebro, Magneto floating through the air, and the climactic battle scene of Wolverine Vs. Sabretooth on the Statue of Liberty, I was thinking, THIS is what you go to the movies for.And not only does X-Men have fantastic special effects, great stunts, and X-ceptional battle scenes, it also has a good story and good characters. I know some of them deserved more screen time, but they still were such great actors who really portrayed the fact that the X-Men weren't all happy best friends. I loved the tension between Logan (Wolverine) and Cyclops. You can tell that they didn't like each other from the start. And the story was not built around special effects and fight scenes (unlike a very overrated movie starring Keanu Reeves), but it had substance. I could tell Bryan Singer really wanted to prove that a movie based on comic books could be more than a comic-book movie. And of course, this movie had the COOLEST villains in it. Mystique was a purely evil and sinister spy and had the coolest morphing ability (her power was probably the coolest out of all the mutants), Toad had a wicked sense of humor and was great to see in battle using his tongue, slime, and leaping ability to fantastic use, Sabretooth was a badass mutant with strong senses of smell and had sweet fight scenes with Logan (especially the fight on top of Ellis Island), and Magneto was played SO well by Ian McKellan you could just FEEL his presence throughout the movie. He also had such an awesome power. I'd love to be able to control all metal objects.All in all, X-Men was one of funnest movies I've ever been to in a long time. It will never bore you and will keep you captivated with it's phenomenal special effects, awesome fight scenes, great humor, exciting story, and characters you can grow to love. Now I can't wait until the sequel. 10/10",10,0,0,15 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Marvelously Entertaining and Visually Stunning!
","Sleepy Hollow is by far a visual masterpiece. Tim Burton surpasses absolutely anyone with his dark and quirky visions. Just looking at the town of Sleepy Hollow in the previews, I knew this movie would be a great treat. Johnny Depp's performance in the movie was exceptional! Ichabod Crane's character in the new version of the classic story is by far the greatest character I've seen on a movie screen in a long time. The Headless Horseman is awesome in the movie. Ray Park was amazing with the incredible stunts he did. The fight scene on the bridge, Brom Bones and Ichabod vs. The Horseman, reminded me of the fabulous fight scene at the end of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Christopher Walken was creepy as the Horseman with his head on. But most of all, the movie was outrageously exciting. The movie kept my adrenaline going the whole time. And one thing I haven't heard anyone say before, was that the story was great. I loved all the twists in the movie. Sure, it was confusing in some parts, but it all got solved at the end.Well, now I need to come to the flaws in the movie. The music by Danny Elfman, although fit for the movie, was not as memorable as all the other scores he did with Tim Burton, like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, or Beetlejuice. And the end was a little silly, when you found out who the (unfortunately) real villain of the movie was. The romance between Ichabod and Katrina was pointless, even though I wasn't as annoyed about it as some other reviewers. Some of the acting in the movie was stiff, like in The Phantom Menace.But even though it had its flaws, it still was an awesome movie. It was visually beautiful, it had a great script, it was extremely exciting and gory, and Johnny Depp was so great to watch in the movie because of his amazing acting ability. Yeah, I was a little overhyped about the movie, but no movie could get up to the quality I thought Sleepy Hollow would have. Oh well, it still was a very good film, and Tim Burton has definitely redeemed himself after the misconcepted Mars Attacks.",5,0,0,20 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Magnificent climax to the series!!
","Just in case you're thinking that I don't know my Star Wars by saying that ROTJ is the climax, I can tell you right now that there is a less than a 1% chance that the sequel trilogy will happen. Anyway, Return of the Jedi is definitely up to par with the first two (not counting Ep. 1). Though it may lack in a FEW places, it still is as great of a movie to have the words Star Wars in the title. My favorite parts are all the ones with Emperor Palpatine, the whole beginning involving Jabba the Hutt, and the fight scene at the end. I don't know why everyone hates the ewoks. They are a great touch to the Star Wars series. Besides, you need some charm in the final chapter in the series, just like you need some charm in the first chapter in the series (hint, hint: don't hate Jar Jar). ROTJ has classic moments in it, just like the others. Take the sarlacc for example, or the rancor. Those scenes have just as much in it for a true classic moment that the space slug did, or the sand people. All in all, ROTJ is the best climax to a series I've ever seen, and I'm glad that it had to be from the phenomenal part of culture called Star Wars.",7,1,2,16 June 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Breathtaking
","Die hard fans of the Tolkien books have torn apart this movie. All the comments are the same: DISGRACE TO TOLKIEN!!!, or NEVER HOW IT SHOULD'VE BEEN MADE!!! Please, stop!!!!! I've read the books many times, and sure, there are differences, but a movie that completely copies the reading material will utterly bore people to death. This was the best movie of 2001 and one of my all-time favorite adventure movies. And I don't care what anyone says, Peter Jackson captures the essence of the book better than anyone else could've ever dreamed. Nit-picky fans: YOU try to make a movie with more passion, excitement, adventure, and feeling! You know, I respect fans that don't think it fit with their vision of Middle-Earth, but come on!!! IT'S SO WRONG TO COMPARE A MOVIE TO THE BOOK IT'S BASED ON!!! Judge the movie on it's own!!! Oh well, people hating the movie based on book comparisons are at least better than when people complain: 'That ending was so abrupt!' That annoys me to no end more than anything else.Final Note: Anyone that would rather enjoy a movie for what it is on its own than nit-pick it to death for its differences to a book will love this brilliant movie. 10/10",10,1,1,6 February 2002
Edward Scissorhands," Amazing and Sad Film.
","Edward Scissorhands id one of Tim Burton's greatest films, and all of his are great films. The movie is a very emotional and artistic movie. The movie is in a class by itself. I couldn't put this movie in any basic genre, though most Tim Burton films can't be, either. Edward Scissorhands has a very artistic and fantasy-like story, one we knew couldn't happen in real life, but it also has a lot of touches of the real world. For example, the setting of the movie is completely far fetched, yet as the story progresses, Edward finds out about many real life problems. We all do, and we all find out about the monsters in us all. Edward, the artificial and 'crippled' man in the story is the only one that does not have that characteristic in him, while the rest of the cast, normal humans, are the real monsters in the film. Johnny Depp gives a stupendous and absolutely exceptional performance as Edward, a creation made by his master, the late Vincent Price. Edward's creator and master dies before he can complete him, so Edward is left with an error-scissors for hands. He lives up in a mansion until a local Avon lady brings him to her neighborhood, where he falls in love with Kim Boggs, played by Winona Ryder. What follows are extremely sad scenes of the neighborhood slowly progressing to thinking Edward is some monster, especially after a terrible decision Edward makes. Anthony Michael Hall plays the villain-type roll as Kim's boyfriend. He is the main reason why Edward is typecast as a monster in the neighborhood. The ending is very emotional, I can't say that it happy emotion either. The movie succeeds in everything it tries to accomplish. This movie proved to me that there wasn't anything Tim Burton couldn't accomplish. The movie was a flat out masterpiece. 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,3 December 1999
Spider-Man," Spidey as he's meant to be onscreen.
","Not since 1989's Batman has there been such a brilliant, fun, and hyperactive comic-book adaptation. Evil Dead and Darkman helmer Sam Raimi has gone back to his roots to deliver an over-the-top and energetic extravaganza that hits all the right levels of campiness and seriousness. There have been many comic-book movies in the past few years, but all of them have had a fatal flaw to keep it from true greatness. Batman Returns (a sequel I feel is better than the original) can really only be enjoyed by Tim Burton fans. Blade, although it was extremely entertaining, was FAR too over-the-top and cheesy to be anything more than a popcorn and eye-candy movie. X-Men, still one of the most ambitious comic-book movies to be brought to screen, had the flaw of taking itself TOO seriously, therefore the campy sequences felt strange and unmatched with the rest of the film. Batman + Robin, well, let's just not go there. Spider-Man gets it all right. Tobey Maguire's brilliant performance of Peter Parker, as well as the death of Uncle Ben, perfectly parallel the hyper kinetic and exxagerated style of filming (a trait from Raimi's earlier films) and the cheese wiz performance by Willem Dafoe, who seems to be having even MORE fun with his performance than in Shadow of the Vampire.     Aside from the comic-book justice, Raimi also will please fans of the cult classic Evil Dead and Darkman films. Taking a step away from his more drama-driven career turn, he returns to his unique style of filmmaking, where almost EVERY shot of film is moving fiercely or spinning around violently. The fact that the CGI is a bit cartoony fits his wacky vision very nicely. After 13 years, the long-awaited Spider-Man matches the group of classic comic-films along with Burton's Batman and Richard Donner's Superman and shows us the way comic-book movies SHOULD be.",10,0,0,3 May 2002
The Evil Dead," Good, but not as good as 2 and 3
","Evil Dead is a good cult movie, but has many errors. One of them is that it's supposed to be a disturbing and scary movie, but has an over the top and pretty cheesy plot. That's probably why 2 and 3 added loads of comedy which turned those two into marvelous movies. But having it serious, though, it doesn't really work. I give it credit for the directing and sort of disturbing scenes, but I highly recommend that you see Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness first. Evil Dead 2 is sort of a remake of it, so it won't hurt you at all by seeing those 2 first.",10,0,1,23 February 1999
The Fly," A Superb and Terrifying Movie!
","I have to admit it. The Fly is the only David Cronenberg movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen any of his others, such as The Dead Zone, Naked Lunch, or eXiStenZ (I think that's how you spell it). But it's just an example that you don't have to be a Cronenberg fan to enjoy this classic. The movie was definitely not a horror movie starring a mad scientist who transforms into an evil fly. It's really not even a horror movie. It's a drama with amounts of romance and suspense/horror. Jeff Goldblum did the best performance of his career as Seth Brundle, a scientist who has invented something he calls 'Telepods'. They're pods that transport you from pod to pod, space to space. He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend (Geena Davis) is seeing someone else (John Getz), even though his belief is wrong. He tries the pods out for himself, unknowing that a fly got trapped in the pod with him. The pods splice them together, and slowly throughout the movie, Seth Brundle transforms into a gross and devastating creature, half man, half fly.The movie had no errors in it. The acting was great, the terrifying score by Howard Shore was amazing, the directing was exceptional, the story was brilliant, and the extremely sick and disgusting special effects were fantastic. Go see this movie! But don't go on a full stomach, unless you want to lose that meal in you.",10,60,89,9 January 2000
Psycho," Hitchcock did it all in this one.
","When Psycho came out, the horror industry of movies was merely monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is different, different from every other movie you have ever seen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great. Too bad the sequels and the new remake was complete trash.",10,122,152,19 January 2000
Army of Darkness," Totally awesome sequel to the Evil Dead movies!
","Army of Darkness was a hilarious movie. I hope that no one takes this movie as a serious movie. It simply tries to be bad for the excitement of the audience. Evil Dead 1 and 2, which were the first two in the trilogy, were more horror than Army of Darkness. The first was a serious cult movie. The second was sort of a remake of it, adding a lot of black comedy and not taking itself seriously. Army of Darkness, the third, adds a lot of comedy elements, it doesn't even take itself really as a horror movie. Well, with hilarious moments, decent special effects (good for it's time), exciting scenes, this movie is simply great.",10,2,2,23 February 1999
Scream 2," Funfilled and clever, but a couple mistakes.
","When I first saw Scream 2 I thought that it was way better than the first one. Then when I saw it a couple more times, I noticed the problems of the movie. Although the script is as fresh with its characters and dialogue, some scenes in the movie are very predictable. It wasn't scary at all. The main killer at the end was stupid, I admit that. I loved the first killer that you found out about, as well as his/her motive. But then the movie introduced the partner, who turned out to be the main killer. It was really stupid. They cast the wrong person for it, and it just didn't work in many respects.Now, with the problems out of the way, I can tell you about the good things about the movie. I absolutely loved the whole idea of Stab in this movie. It created something totally different in the new movie world. For those of you who have not seen the movie, Stab is a movie-within a-movie based on the events in the first Scream. Tori Spelling plays Sidney, David Schwimmer plays Dewey, etc... It was very clever. It was also just as funny as the first one, and I was roaring with laughter during the scene when Dewey sees Gale and has a little talk about her book. Jamie Kennedy was in the spotlight for most of the film, and he did just as good a performance as Randy as he did in the first one. The whole cast of new people fit the Scream team very well, especially Jerry O'Connell, Sid's new boyfriend away at college.So, all in all, the movie was very good despite its weak ending and its sometimes predictable storyline. I used to think it was the best Scream, but the more I think about it, the more it's the worst one. It still is very good, though, and is a worthwhile and worthy follow-up to the greatest horror movie of the 1990's.",8,0,0,5 February 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the greatest works of art I have ever seen!
","I am absolutely outraged at some of the reviews I read about this beautiful movie. I can't believe that people said it was boring! How could you think that this movie lacks in story?! And come on, Gary Oldman gave the greatest Dracula performance of any recent vampire movies! He's right up there with Bela Lugosi. The acting in the movie was great! Okay, maybe Keanu Reeves did a bad accent and was miscast. But he was hardly in the movie past the beginning. Winona Ryder was spectacular as Mina. And one thing that I absolutely hated about some reviews was the fact that they say the movie wasn't scary. Of course it wasn't scary, it was a dark romance!The movie was a flat out love story between Dracula and Mina. That's what was so great about the movie. It turned the story of Dracula, a story filled with horror, into a love story.The way the movie was filmed was stunning. The different ways Frances Ford Coppola directs the movie is astounding! The film truly is a work of art.
The cast was brilliant. Anthony Hopkins was amazing. Winona Ryder was marvelous. Gary Oldman did such a great performance as the cursed prince, who you actually feel sympathy for as the story goes on. Keanu Reeves was miscast, but he didn't ruin the movie whatsoever.The story was excellent, absolutely excellent. It was great how the story was divided into three parts: 1) Johnathan Harker goes to Castle Dracula and plunges into madness as he discovers the terrifying secrets of the Count. 2) Dracula comes to visit Mina, and they fall in love. 3) Prof. Van Helsing and the main characters hunt down Dracula by train to stop him before he gets to his castle in Transylvania to grow strong again.Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the movie is a grand experience in moviemaking. Everyone should go out and rent it, but don't expect to see a horror movie about an evil vampire, but a tragic love story about a cursed prince and his reincarnated princess falling in love during a very dark and horrifying time.",10,1,3,3 October 1999
The Green Mile," Absolutely amazing, powerful, and chilling!
","When I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked good, yet not at all as amazing as the modern day masterpiece The Shashank Redemption. It definitely didn't look as powerful. Man, I was completely wrong! This movie is not only the greatest film of 1999, but in my top ten favorite movies! It is the only movie where every single actor in it was outstanding! Tom Hanks once again does an exceptional role in this movie, but I was also very glad that he was not the only one in the movie that had character. Everyone had an outstanding character in this masterpiece. The story was breathtaking, and the fabulous directing by Frank Darabont added to the great screenplay. Some scenes in the movie were EXTREMELY powerful and also VERY disturbing. One scene in the movie would always stand out in my mind as nerve-wrenching. I can predict the oscars now: Tom Hanks winning best actor, Michael Duncan winning best supporting actor, Frank Darabont winning best director, Frank Darabont winning best screenplay, and The Green Mile winning best picture. I certainly hope that's the way they'll go, since they all deserve to win. I am also very mad at people complaining about the length of the film. Okay, maybe some scenes could have been taken out, but still, every scene in the movie was great! The only flaw I can find in the movie is the slapped together and far fetched ending. The movie should have ended after the final death. It shouldn't have gone back to the old Paul Edgecomb, who explains a cheesy ending. But still, the ending doesn't ruin the movie whatsoever. It still is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it will stay on my list for years to come.",10,1,2,15 December 1999
Scream," Made Me Become a Slasher Fan!
","Scream has to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made. People that have not seen the film or its sequels would probably think of it as a plotless horror movie with bad acting, just like its inspirations (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). That steriotypical remark is so far from the truth it's amazing. Scream is a funfilled, extremely clever, and exceptionally funny movie that it is right up there with Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Psycho as my favorite horror movie. This movie has everything a scary movie can offer. The beginning is the greatest beginning to any movie I have ever seen. The Ghostface costume and the terrifying voice is bone-chilling. It is pretty scary (And I'm a guy that doesn't get scared by movies too often) and it has many edge-of-your-seat thrills. The script is so original and fresh. It has such thoughtful and great characters. And who the killer(s) turn out to be is totally awesome. I really loved this movie. It made me become a teen slasher fan. This movie has inspired me to see the Halloween movies, the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and even the ghastly and horrible Friday the 13th movies. The story is totally unpredictable and is so funny in places that I was on the floor laughing (especially the scenes with Randy). If you are a fan of teen movies and horror movies, you have to rent this movie. It is complete and all out fun!",10,0,0,5 February 2000
Halloween," The origin of mad slasher movies.
","If Halloween never existed, you could also forget about Friday the 13th, Scream, Nightmare on Elm Street, and all the rest of the mad slasher movies and their sequels. Halloween created them all, because Halloween originated that type of movie. It is probably the most classic horror film out of all the classic horror films. It is also a classic which you can still be scared of. Watching Halloween gives me chills every time I see Michael. Michael Myers is by far the best masked killer out of all the rest. His mask is so freaky. The way he walks like a robot is bone-chilling. Everything about him is pure terror. He IS horror. The movie itself has a low budget, but that doesn't effect the movie at all. Because it uses classic terror to frighten the audience, not blood and gore like today's horror movies. All the classics; Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho. They all had almost no blood and gore, but they are all still terrifying because of the psychological horror. John Carpenter does an excellent job at doing that. Halloween gets half the credit it should get today. Today the most popular horror icons are Freddy and Jason. We all have to remember,though, that those movies couldn't have existed without John Carpenter's classic tale, Halloween.",10,0,1,6 July 1999
Final Destination," An Original and Entertaining Film.
","What really had me going about Final Destination was not the terrifying and gory deaths, or the the non-stop entertainment plot, or even the most original and frightening beginning since Scream. What really got me to enjoy this movie was the completely new idea of the 'slasher movie without the slasher' idea, the magnificently shot scenes which kept you so freaked out about what was going to happen, the freaky and eerie score, and the amazingly fresh plot. After three years of lame and predictable slasher movies (with the exception of the well done Scream movies), Final Destination gives us a totally new look on death. Has there ever been any way of death in movies that aren't murders, accidents, or suicides? Final Destination gives us something new: the form of death itself gets cheated by five teenagers who get removed from a plane which explodes in mid-air. They were supposed to die with the rest of the passangers. Now Death is mad, and it decides to kill off the teenagers one-by-one to balance things out, using accidents and framed suicides to hide the fact that death is on a rampage of revenge. As each character dies throughout the story, the main character Alex, who can somehow see the deaths before they happen, looks desperately and tries to find Death's pattern of killing, because if he finds that, they can cheat death again.This movie has some problems, like the scene with the mortician, but because of the fresh story, the superb death scenes, the fine acting, and the very eerie feeling you get while watching the movie, you hardly even notice them. The movie also has great comedy in it, something only the Scream movies have perfected.So all in all, Final Destination is a thrill machine that definitely kept me going the whole time. I very much hope that movies like these are made more often now that slashers are finally being forgotten.",8,0,0,27 March 2000

","I need to finally say this. Andrew Niccol has done two movies, and both are on my top 3 list. Gattaca was AMAZING! Everything about that movie was spectacular! Now here comes The Truman Show, which was written but not directed by the genius, and is almost as good. The story is SO unique! There has never been anything like it before! Jim Carrey is exceptional! Peter Weir, who did another movie on my top 3 list, Dead Poets Society, did a FANTASTIC job directing this story of paranoia! And of course, the script is brilliant. Jim Carrey should really be proud of himself for doing such a different role, and to star in a DRAMA-comedy. This movie is definitely on my top 3. That's funny, my top 3 movies all have something in common: Ethan Hawke is in Dead Poets Society and Gattaca, Gattaca was written by Andrew Niccol along with The Truman Show, and Peter Weir directed The Truman Show along with Dead Poets Society! (Note: I do not count the Star Wars movies on my top 3 list because I don't count those as movies, I count those as empire's.) I am very glad that this story had very little comedy elements in it. It was mostly drama and fantasy. This movie is a very unique and special movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes unique stories. Just don't expect to see a Jim Carrey comedy-type movie.",10,0,0,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," greatest movie in the world
","Star Wars is not just a movie. It's American Culture. And all I can say is that I'm a hard core Star Wars fanatic, have all the toys, seen the movie over 300 times, and am going to see Phantom Menace opening night! If it weren't for this movie, modern day films would suck. Star Wars was the originater of awesome special effects, and if it wasn't for this movie, we wouldn't have half the movie technology that we have today. This trilogy is marvelous, and I'm 100% certain that the prequels will be.",10,0,0,14 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The greatest Star Wars of all!!!!!!
","The Empire Strikes Back is the absolute greatest Star Wars in the series. I am a huge Star Wars fanatic, and TESB has so much in it that makes it such a marvelous movie. It has the best action scenes (the excellent fight scene), the best story (Luke's training, the romance between Leia and Han), the best secrets revealed ('Luke, I am your father'), and the best suspense (Luke dangling from Cloud City). Everything about this movie is gold. It surpasses everything from the others (besides special effects of Ep. 1 and the fight scene from Ep. 1). I cannot find one thing bad or even mediocre from this film. Well, I actually can't find one thing bad about the others, except some scenes from Ep.1 and that huge sphere with the needle sticking out used to torture Leia in the Death Star in A New Hope. All in all, TESB is a magnificent movie which adds another plus in the phenomenal series.",10,0,0,16 June 1999
Beetlejuice," a dark and unique comedy.
","Beetlejuice is a very unique movie, but I'm not surprised. Tim Burton, master of the macabre, directed this odd movie. I have to say that this movie isn't only dark, it's hilarious. The movie is truly funny, and the blend between horror and humor was superb. It's about a wife and husband, played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, who die in a car accident. The two still live on Earth, but as ghosts. Suddenly, a family moves into their house and changes it all around into a cold and weird house. The two ghosts are now miserable, so they decide to try to scare them out. It doesn't work. They go into the spirit world to ask for some help. Their advice lady gives them some excellent ways to scare them out. It still doesn't work. But something else happens, too. The family's weird daughter, played by Winona Ryder, finds out about them. She becomes they're freind. It still doesn't stop the ghosts desire to get them out of the house, so they do something no one thought of. They called a man from the spirit world, one who specializes in these sort of things. His name is Beetlegeuse, pronounced Beetlejuice, and the scares he has in his  bag of tricks are much, much scarier than the ones the two have tried already. But they start to figure out that Beetlejuice isn't doing this for them, but for himself. He loves to scare, and he'll do anything to do it. They find out that he threatens the life of the family's daughter, and themselves. They must stop him.Although it sounds sort of like a serious horror story, the movie is a total comedy. Still, it has a lot of Tim Burton style quirkiness in it. Michael Keaten is wonderful as Beetlejuice, and once again, Danny Elfman does a great score. If you like dark comedies, and you love Tim Burton, go rent this movie this second.",10,1,2,4 December 1999
Evil Dead II," Best horror movie ever!
","Evil Dead 2 is most likely the best horror movie of all time. It's loaded with gore, it has over the top acting by my idol Bruce Campbell, it has tons of black comedy (though not nearly as much as Army of Darkness, its sequel). Evil Dead 2 takes black comedy where it's never gone before. A cult classic usually has an element of black comedy, but Evil Dead 2 has so much that it doesn't take itself seriously. This movie has taken horror to a new high. This movie has inspired many cult classics such as Dead Alive, a movie which also doesn't take itself seriously. This movie rocks!!",10,0,0,23 February 1999
