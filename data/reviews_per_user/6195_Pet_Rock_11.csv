Gremlins," There's Only 3 Rules!
","Billy (Zach Galligan) just got the best Christmas present ever: A cute fuzzy lil Creature who's as nice as can be. But, with this little Gremlin comes 3 rules, and if you break them, all hell will break loose!8/10- I loved it! While I'll always think of Gremlins as fuzzy green things that bother people on Planes when they're in the... Twilight Zone, these cutie-pies are a joy to watch for an hour and 40 minutes.This was the 3rd Joe Dante film I've seen (Twilight Zone: The Movie and Homecoming) and so far, I've loved all his work. He's a great director and all the actors were top-notch.",8,1,3,27 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.
","Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) endeavors to settle a blood debt to Davey Jones, the infamous captain of the ghostly ship, the Flying Dutchman. Faced with a potential afterlife of servitude and damnation, Jack also has the upcoming wedding of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to consider ...What a dreadful way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes of your life.It wasn't funny. It wasn't interesting. It didn't capture any magic of the first film and it was too damn long.While the acting and directing is good, the writing falls flat as the plot is way too confusing and it doesn't interest you enough to even try to figure it out.The only good part was the scene towards the end where they're at the island- but that isn't enough reason to see the movie.",1,9,14,15 August 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Watchable, but doesn't match the funny of the show...
","When Stan (Trey Parker), Eric (Trey Parker), Kyle (Matt Stone) and Kenny (Matt Stone) go seen an R rated movie (that was made in Canada) they start cussing. When Kyle's mom (Mary Kay Bergman) hears him cussing she blames Canada. Soon, everyone starts blaming Canada and a war is started.I don't know why I didn't like this as much as the TV show. Maybe it's because I don't like Terrance and Phillip at all. Or maybe it's because loud 'bleeeeeeep's are funnier than the actual words. I'm not sure.The music is wonderful. But the comedy just isn't there as much as the other shows. Cartman isn't as racist and rude, he just cusses a bunch.In fact, most of the comedy was replaced with cuss words and sex jokes that they could't say on TV.So, it's not for everybody, but most people seem to like it, so give it a go.",5,0,3,17 August 2006
Final Destination 2," Fairly good sequel...
","This time, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a dream of a horrible of a deadly car crash killing many, many people. So when she wakes up her and a few others get out of their car and witness the horror themselves. Now, of course, they start to die in the order of how they would have, or are they? The opener is not as fantastic as in the first one, but the rest of the movie is better, in my opinion. Just like the first, there's a lot of sagging moments. Also, just like the original, the first murder is just okay. But the next 3 or 4 murders make up for it. In the end, it's all confusing and plot twists and crap with an interesting ender.",6,0,0,2 August 2006
The Thing," Who the hell's the thing?!
","This is, possible, one of the only 3 good horror remakes (Hills Have Eyes and The Fly behind it) in fact, this is the best remake. A remake of The Thing from Another World (1951) Both films were based on the short story 'Who Goes There?' by Don A. Stuart.this is perhaps, the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. Yeah. Forget about Jurrasic Park, or Titanic or that crap, this is the real deal.It is fun, scary, gory, near perfect. Even my mom loved it. It was all so perfect. The acting, the directing, the script, everything. And it's super fun to try and guess who's real and who's an alien! No matter what kinda movie you enjoy, you'll love this. It is Carpenter's best (Yes, better than Halloween)",9,1,2,29 July 2006
Annie Hall," Woody's Best!
","We follow the life of Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), growing up under a roller coaster, failed romances, and a new romance with the love of his life... Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) Most people consider Comedy/ Romances to be either Chick Flicks or Date Movies for girls.Well, while this could be called a Date Movie, it's most definitely not only for girls. It's for all. It's what I call a 'Smile Movie' that you just sit there, smiling for an hour and a half until the movie's done. It makes you feel good, and it's really funny! The tag line, 'A nervous romance.' is correct. Both Alvy and Annie are quite fun characters. Alvy, a comedian who always worries and Annie, an awkward woman with a wonderful laugh and a small additicion to drugs.Woody Allen's movies are usually 6/5 (In my opinion), for being fun flicks with a few laughs but just an all around feel good feel to them- but this one's special. The feel good-ness is cranked up even higher, along with the laughs! So grab your sweetheart (or your sweetheart-to-be) or just when you're feelin blue, pop this in and enjoy!",8,0,1,18 August 2006
The Descent," So great! So great!
","A year after Sarah's (Shauna Macdonald) daughter (Molly Kayll) and husband (Oliver Milburn) die in a car crash, her and her adventure loving friends (Natalie Jackson Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder and more) go down into a cave. While down there however, the cave collapses on them, and hungry 'Crawlers' (Craig Conway, Leslie Simpson, Mark Cronfield and more) are dying to eat them.Neil Marshall is the future of horror. This film defines claustrophobia the way The Thing defines paranoia.It starts off as a sad, sad drama. It morphs into an adventure, rockets to a thriller, and splashes into a horror! You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll scream at the Crawlers, you'll just plain love this movie if you're a horror fan, and you'll also like this movie even if you're not.A NOTE TO HORROR JUNKIES IN USA: Watch this and then Snakes on a Plain in a row and you'll give yourself an orgasm. Hurry now before it leaves theaters!",9,2,6,20 August 2006
Step Up," Bland, un-original movie with not-so-great dancing.
","When Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) with his friend Mac (Damaine Radcliff) and Skinny (De'Shawn Washington) break into an art school for fun, they get caught by a cop. Tyler distracts him to let his buddies run free. Now Tyler must do work for the school, where he helps out a lovely girl (De'Shawn Washington) who dances ballet.Choreographer Anne Fletcher does a horrible job in her directorial debut and even fans of this movie will agree that the dancing is not that good at all.Duane Adler basically remakes his great movie Save the Last Dance. However, just like all remakes, it's way worse than the original.Channing's character is very irritating and his awful acting doesn't help much.The Drama isn't very dramatic, the romance isn't very romantic, and the comedy isn't very funny. It's also dull at times and very forgettable.",4,8,17,15 August 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the (If not THE) Smartest films ever.
","Serial Killer 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine) is on the loose, killing woman in strange and horrible ways. An FBI-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is sent by her boss (Scott Glenn) to go interrogate smart serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who lives in a small dark cell run by the mean Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald). Young Clarice is just starting a sick, scary game of mystery, all held together by Dr. Lecter.My god. What a masterpiece. The writers of this movie (Thomas Harris and Ted Tally) must be two of the smartest people on this planet right now. The twists and turns in this movie are unlike your usual twists ('What? He's really been dead for 10 years?!' or 'What? He's really my other personality?) where something stupid and/or unbelievable happens. In a strange way, this film is believable and that makes it even scarier.Oh, yes. Another thing I must note. While this is mainly a 'thriller', it's still a horror. Some people just can't stand that the 'lowest form of cinema' has come up with this. It will scare you silly.Another film that's for almost everyone (Excluding little Billy). It's no popcorn film, but it's also not an ANTI-popcorn film. It's genius, really! Enjoy!",9,0,0,2 September 2006
Final Destination," Original and Entertaining, but sometimes dull...
","Okay, this movie is very, very original and that's extremely rare for today, so I'm happy this came out to start it all. However, unlike the usual case, in my opinion, this isn't the best in the series.Thank god for Jeffrey Reddick! After Alex (Devon Sawa) has a dream of a horrible plane crash in which all his friends die horrible deaths (In one of the best horror movie scenes in years) He gets in a fight with a bully (Kerr Smith) and him and a couple of others, including Clear Rivers (Ali Larter with her cheesy character name) and a teacher (Kristen Cloke). But, after the crash the people begin to die in strange 'accidents'.After the AMAZING opener, the movie sags a little with a 'just okay' death. Than, some more sagging, a quick scene that will leave you breathless, more sagging, another great death scene, and than the rest is just sagging.",5,1,1,2 August 2006
The Matrix," Great ideas, bad script.
","A regular man (Keanu Reeves) learns a shocking truth about the world and joins a rag tag group (Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Marcus Chong and more) to save it.The Wachowski brothers are truly geniuses. Sadly, they lack in actual WRITING talents (IMO obviously) and it just didn't click. They did a fantastic job directing, but flopped in the script.The actors are great, and Laurence's gap tooth defined his character for me, and the action scenes are the best in ages.It just would have been better if the Wachowski brothers got some one else to write the script off of their ideas.But enough of the script. This movie is far from bad. It's great fun in a group, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll have a blast.And it was a little too long, too. Oh well, maybe I just can't enjoy a long movie no matter how good it is. But you'll enjoy this modern epic of suspense and action!",7,0,2,15 September 2006
