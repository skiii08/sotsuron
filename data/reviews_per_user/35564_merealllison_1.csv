Blade Runner 2049," So much yet so little.
","I don't hate this movie, but it was definitely a letdown. For a movie that was as long as this was, I expected to get so much more out of it. First I want to start out with the setting. The graphics are wonderful and I credit everybody who worked on making it so. It's not the classic look from the 80's, but it definitely sucks you into a foreign world. Second, the whole android/replicant love thing was a bit overdone, but I understand why it was included. We are seeing Blade Runner from a replicant's point of view, and this shows how lonely replicants are, and their loneliness is actually touched on in the book a little, so not bad on that part. Third, animals were briefly referenced in the part where K gets his wooden horse analyzed by some black market dealer of some sort. After finding out it is real wood, the dealer offers K a real animal. This is definitely a reference to the book being that animals were very valuable in this universe. I liked how they explored K's journey to becoming more 'aware' sort of, and discovering a humanity he didn't think he had. I loved the acting of Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Edward James Olmos. The rest, however, was lacking and didn't feel genuine at all. The bad guy in this movie was some strange guy that made replicants. Nothing like Tyrell, who actually felt legitimate and somewhat meaningful. His sidekick android was annoying and not needed. The whole android rebellion thing was a step farther than they should have gone and the whole replicants getting pregnant was kind of a weak plot to follow and wasn't very interesting. It blurred what was real and not real, which was cool, but that is all it did. I feel like if the movie focused more on K's journey to finding some sort of humanity, and left out a lot of the junk (replicant pregnancy, weak and lacking enemies) this could have been more profound and meaningful.",7,2,6,8 October 2017
