Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the best
","Well, it is Saturday May 22nd and I just saw Star Wars Episode I, the Phantom Menace and I must say that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I would love to go see it again but not right now. But seriously it was a great movie. It was able to mix Humor, Action and Suspense all in one but it had a hard time keeping the suspense. Since the first 3 Star Wars they made were actually 4, 5, and 6. It must have had a hard time keeping the suspense since most people know who lived and who should have died.I am not a BIG Star Wars fan. They are interesting to me but I am not a BIG fan of Star Wars. I liked the way that they switched back and forth. They had the little boy flying the starship, the three guys fighting, the queen and others in the empire and the war between the green guys and the robots going on all at one time. I liked that a lot. It gave you everything you would want with many special effects.",10,0,0,22 May 1999
