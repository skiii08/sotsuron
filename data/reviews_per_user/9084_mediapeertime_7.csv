The Devil's Advocate," Scary, Thought Provoking, Just Great
","This is one of the best films about Satan. Great at deceiving, full of power, loses in the end - as the devil should! This was altogether a great lawyer film. In this film, we get to see one of Pacino's best performances. He wasn't that usual character that we'r5e so used to seeing. Also tremendous performances by Charlize Theron, Connie Nielson, Jeffrey Jones, Tamara Tunie, and Craig T. Nelson. Couldn't buy Keaneau Reeves in the best lawyer role. he was adequate at best. Watch the train scene with Al Pacino - just tremendous! Taylor Hackford, great work (except casting of Reeves, but that mau not have been his choice????)",9,2,2,15 September 2013
The Longest Yard," Not Nearly as Good as the Original
","The original version of The Longest Yard is a near classic. Burt Reynolds was believable as the ex-football star turned bad guy. Burt Reynolds was a big, tough man in his 30s and 40s. he was one of the top sex symbols and movie stars at the time The Longest Yard was made in the mid-70s. It made sense that women were falling over him, which partially got him in trouble in the beginning of the movie. But Adam Sandler? Are you kidding me? Sandlker playing a role that Burt Reynolds originated? Sandler playing a role of a tough guy? That's just not believable. It's even more absurd that played a former NFL quarterback. This guy probably couldn't throw the ball a yard, much less the longest yard. The Longest Yard is a move that needs to be carried on the back of its star. Burt Reynolds did that so well in the original. Sandler, a huge miscast (probably by his own demanding) couldn't this movie off the ground. And that's where the football would be with him, on the ground, under a heap of football players who would have flattened the wimpy Sandler. The movie gets a five overall, however, because of a decent supporting cast (including Reynolds), and it was still a good story.",5,2,3,15 September 2013
L.A. Confidential," Awesome Character Piece
","A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.",9,1,2,15 September 2013
Invincible," Tremendous, Movie Sports Film
","I like Mark Wahlberg in some movies, others I think he is just okay. In this one, I thought he was just great. he plays a truly likable former high school football player (who never played in college), but still hits the 'gridiron' in pick up games in South Philly in the late 1970s. He's lost his job as a high school teacher and his wife left him, leaving a note that he will never go anywhere in life. Well, things change rather quickly when Dick Vermil (played strongly by Greg Kinear) takes over for the desperate, losing Philadelphia Eagles. Vermil decides to give walk-on tryouts to Philadelphia natives, as a publicity stunt. One person gets called to camp, and that's Wahlberg's character. This is a definite inspirational story, which is based on a true story, where the guy actually makes the team. Wahlberg's character has speed, intensity, passion, and will, and he becomes a special teams expert, playing 3 or 4 years in the NFL. Only downside,as I have learned in many of these 'biographical' movies, is that while it was close to the truth, there were many things in the movie that turned out to be just plain false. but if you're watching Invincible as just a movie, and not a biography, then this is great one, which didn't get the critical reviews it deserves.",9,0,0,17 July 2013
Pretty Woman," Way Overrated and Stud Millionaires Don't Fall for Hookers
","Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her 'pretty', the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.",5,5,9,15 September 2013
Iron Man," Great Superhero Movie
","As a kid I loved superhero movies. As an adult, I do too. It's really the story that drives any movie to me. So a superhero movie that is just all special effects and action really does nothing for me. Iron Man, like the original Superman and the Tobey McGuire Spiderman has a great story. Tony Stark, played in avery likable way by Robert Downey, Jr, is somewhat of an egotistical, rich kid with a great mind, but he is endearing, even from the beginning of the movie. You can tell he has aheart, but flaws like any person. After he is captured by villainous terrorists, it's exactly his heart (or damage to it) that allows him to create a mechanical suit that turns him into a superhero. So he's not a superhero, at least in his physicality, like Superman. his great mind and circumstances of his life allow him to turn himself into a superhero.Gwyneth Paltrow is superb in this film, and 'love' story between her and Downey (Iron Man) is intesne, and so felt, though they never get together (I guess like every real superherp movie, you really are pulling for them to make out). Also, Jeff Bridges was great in the film, as usual. Fine directing by Swingers creator, Jon Favreau.One point: as good as Downey was, I'd rather have seen someone else in the role. Really, a junkie playing a superhero? Sorry, it just doesn't fit right.Ending the movie with Black Sabbath's 'Iron Man' was just awesome!",8,2,3,17 July 2013
Trainspotting," Unimportant Garbage
","Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position. Whetehr or some took responsibility for their actions is difficult to tell. That would be the only redeeming quality to this movie. I just don't care about the characters. If the O.D., should I care? I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters. I didn't sympathize with them at all, nor the writer and director for their waste of millions of dollars in making this unimportant garbage. I would give the movie a 1, but it was well made.",3,11,25,15 September 2013
