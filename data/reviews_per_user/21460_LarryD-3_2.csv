The Blair Witch Project," Amazing! Why do people find this scary? It didn't happen!
","Really went expecting to be scared. Didn't happen!I read, and was told just how scary this was.  Couldn't wait to see this movie.  Told my son that he would be scared to death. Just didn't happen.Kept looking at my watch during the movie thinking, 'we'll, there's 40 minutes left, it's gotta start getting scary now' Just didn't happen.I said OK, I have heard that the end is 'really' scary.  Then the movie ended, and my wife and I looked at each other in disbelief.  This movie just didn't work.  And the scary parts JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN!",2,0,2,2 August 1999
Memento," Pass this one!
","I checked out IMDB to find a good movie to rent.  Saw that 'Momento' was ranked 9 on the all time list.  My wife remembered seeing it at the local store yesterday, so I rushed to get it!As I was reaching for it, a lady next to me said 'it's not that good'.I thought, 'yea right, 16000 IMDB movie reviewers are calling this a top ten of all time movie, and you are saying it's no good...'Well, she was right, and 16000 IMDBers were wrong.  Not really a good movie. Don't believe the hype.  Pass this one up!",1,31,60,27 October 2001
