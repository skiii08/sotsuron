The Blair Witch Project," ridiculously stupid film
","After much bally-hoo, the film opened to a standing room only crowd at an Arts Theater in South Toledo.  The beginning of the movie lived up to its hype - herky-jerky, black-and-white, and sometimes out of focus, film shot by 'rented' cameras - unfortunately, this is where the entire movie remained: in the cheap rent district!  This movie fails to titillate, let alone shock the senses.  The crowd was probably 80% of the 17 to 22 years of age group with older people filling the void.  To get a true measure of a movie's fright factor one needs only to count the number of 'snuggles' seen throughout the audience.  This is when a young and innocent female buries her face in the shoulder of her date while screaming at a fevers pitch. This movie produced zero screams, zero snuggle opportunities and absolutely no one hiding from what was happening on the screen.  I did see a score or two of people yawning with boredom (admittedly, I was guilty of this reflex action on several occasions).  The movie was a joke!  The ending was as predictable as the sun rising in the east each and every morning.  I watched small children (with their parents)exchanging laughs and jokes as they departed the movie theater and somehow knew there would not be any 'nightmares' in that household.  The film hasn't any of the absolute 'fear driven quality' the original Halloween had, and Witch can't even hold a candle to An American Werewolf in London or something as simple as the 'step-and-slide acting of The Mummy (1938?).  Save your time, and your money, and rent something from the video store.On a scale of 1 - 10, I give this film a 2!",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
