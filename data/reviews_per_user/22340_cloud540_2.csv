The Blair Witch Project," Pitiful
","As a Virginian, I went to see this for a little bit of history- IT WAS NOT TRUE. Was it scary- yes, scary to think someone could make such a terrible movie and pass it off as a cinema.  If you have seen the movie you know you could have spent those 5 dollars on better things, like a pizza.  If you want to rent this movie be fair warned, the people who said this movie was good, went to sleep and dreamed it was good. Would you let a thirteen year old see it? I would not let a 31 year old go through the torture. If you want to see it, then rent it, wasting money is one thing owning this is worse.",1,2,4,28 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Greatest film ever
","I may not own a lightsaber, and I surely don't read the books, but this movie was the best I've ever seen.  This has an excellent mixture of romance, comedy, action, and mystery.  This has to be one of the best movies of all time.  It ROCKED!!!  I'll tell you that I experienced a true star wars experience when I saw the midnight show on 5/16.  There was a countdown, people laughed at all of the jokes, people cheered on the jedi. It was a true experience.  Critics who rate this film low have some problems with movies, and don't deserve the title 'critic'.   This great film gives all people a reason to watch.  If you don't see this movie, your missing out on something great.  Those who rate it low, well, they should be hit in the head with a light saber or something!",10,0,0,16 May 2002
