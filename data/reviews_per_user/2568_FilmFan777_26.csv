The Incredible Hulk," WEAK in Sooo Many Area's..... True Let Down
","Where do I start...? The writing was probably the weakest aspect of this film with the directing close behind.The pace of the film...? Seemed they wanted to build a fairly strong drama base yet it kept going on and on without good dialogue to support it.I thought the CGI was 'far' below that of the 2003 version. Previous Hulk actually had depth! Emotion facially as well as in body language. This version seemed to have none. And the CGI being so bad that it was literally distracting.Liv Tyler... she normally doesn't stand out for me however in my opinion, she did the most with her part, even more then Norton. And I'm a Norton fan yet he seemed to be less engaged characteristically then most of his other work.Tim Roth... good effort however I just didn't buy him and I believe only due the director.William Hurt as the General... Good choice, he did a decent job. Yet one major deficit to his character was he would flip flop so drastically on the connection with his daughter. One moment he couldn't care much less about her let alone help you believe he was her father. And the next, he's demanding she be protected, Huh? I believe the ultimate downfall is owed to the Director for not joining all the pieces together to make an entertaining and well told story. His direction was weak, kept a weak script, infused no chemistry between the characters and the sad thing about it.... is other then a 'better writer' being needed, he had everything else from budget to talent to tent pole to make this film bring the character of the Hulk into the league it should and could be.Why the suits let such an inexperienced director like Louis Leterrier helm such an important character and film is beyond me. (Oh... probably less dough) If that's the case, you get what you pay for. And we get let down.Truly Saddened",5,3,7,22 June 2008
Hostel," Skip It ! ! !
","What a let down this film was. I really felt ripped off because I thought this would be 'at least' a somewhat satisfying fast food fun flick. And hey, I didn't have high expectations in the least either.In summary, the first hour felt like it was written by a horned 18 year old taste testing his own fantasy. Traveling Europe, hooking up with some hot foreigner babes with ease for some romper stomper free reign frolic. I don't mind some fun but COME ON, have some debt or story or .... just SOMETHING here. No worry... no suspense... no creepiness, nothing.Then finally when the ball get's rollin, (and only for a few minutes at that) even the supposed 'gross' or stomach churning points were like a warm flat opened can of coke. No fizzle, nothing! The effects of the, well lets just say the eye ball sequence were blatantly fake taking any fizzle of creepiness from it. Not to mention our 'injured' parties were running around like nothing had been done to them. Hardly a squint of pain to help you remember they'd been, well 'worked on'.If at all anything good, the lead actor has a certain something and I believe he could show up in something more worthy of a chance. The camera work and even the basics of the direction were satisfactory however the script was just crap! They went out for a lil T & A to entice the youths while jumping the (I wanna be like cool like 'Saw'), bandwagon. 'Hey, lets put out a scary movie that sucks and hopefully make some money the first weekend with a bunch of hype before everyone actually realizes...this sucks!'.Not to mention Quentin Tarantino's power meter dropping a couple of notches for putting his name on such a let down piece of shite.So if your a 17 year old guy who's middle name is 'hormone' and you don't care about a film being smart enough to take you away to a good experience, then this might be your jar of Vaseline. Other than that... skip it! P.S. No wonder the box office was down a record 8% this year. Keep putting out this kind of adolescent crap and we'll be seeing drive in movies making a come back.",4,3,6,8 January 2006
127 Hours," Your not watching, your there
","FINALLY... a film this year that gives you sooo much through so very little.Danny Boyle took a regular guy with a wild story and painted it with such vividness I couldn't find a single moment that didn't have me living vicariously within this film.No dazzling special effects, next to no cast, no complex storyline demanding your attention yet the tale is so richly told it's like one of those books that you just cannot put down.You already know the story, but you cannot miss this play. Simply, go see it and ask yourself if this is not one of THE most interesting and well done films this year.Enjoy!",9,1,3,12 December 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," Terribly Weak. Save your money
","*Possible Spoilers*Being an Emmerich fan, I was 'very' disappointed in this film. I wanted so much for it to be good yet on most every....well actually, every front, it's an adolescent attempt at good film making. (I thought you were supposed to get better as you go along)The script was amateur at best other then a few laughs, which I believe were not even intended. The whole concept of global warming is something to take seriously however in this film, they did it no justice other then to make it something to take with no seriousness. Yes, fantasy is fantasy however you must make it somewhat plausible which they failed to do.
The acting was horrific. I didnt feel a thing for a single character or their situation. I dont believe this due the actors themselves as there are two notables. I believe it's short coming is due the director.Special Effects? Very average in my opinion. In fact in most area's, it was very weak.One thing about the politics of this film... People have the right to interject politics if they want, and we have the right to see them or not, and take them seriously or not. However when it comes to film, 'if' your going to interject your view on things know, there's a clever and tasteful way of doing it without taking away from a well made film. Here, the politics seemed more a strong point then the essence of the film itself, which I believe is part of the failure of this picture. 
Overall the chemistry for this film is never present. In the script, directing, acting, special effects, pacing everything. I had a feeling this wasnt going to be a very satisfying film so I can say my expectations were'nt high. So to be so disappointed with 'low' expectations is 'really' a let down. So take your time to read a bit about it.... get the vibe from others and then decide if you want to slap down your hard earned bucks and short amount of time for something you just wont be able to get back.",4,0,0,28 May 2004
Van Helsing," Dissapointing...Not worth the wait
","Some things taste better a bit over cooked. However in this case, Van Helsing 2004 tasted like a burnt bruquette.All the special effects in the world or the best book cover design wont make a good story. It's the content that grabs you at the end of the day and Van Helsing seemed to forget that. No character depth and too many unbelievable holes in the story took this very promising film and turned it into a big turkey. I was so looking forward to if for the idea of the film as well as being a Hugh Jackman fan. However, the director/writer put too much faith in wrapping then he did in content and, what a shame. You might be mildly entertained by 'some' of the decent special effects (or nearly drowned by them)however you'll likely find yourself running out of breath due the pace, or in need of a real meal to fill that empty thing we call, connection and believability.",4,0,0,7 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Weak, Un-Enchanting
","I'll simply say, the story was full of holes like a piece of swiss cheese... there was no feel or sense of danger, darkness, anticipation, worry or magical enchantment as the other's possessed before it.
The script was weak as well as the directing and I found myself looking far too much at my watch for when it was going to end. I really didnt feel any redeeming qualities for this film. The actors being a bit older having something to do with it? Different director? I'm not sure if the writer was the same or not yet I could really feel the difference in all aspects of the film. To be fair, there were a hefty handfull of others at the midnight showing and many of them were laughing. I dont know if it was due the booze or the dizzyness of being so late on a thursday night or if they are just die hard Potterins that anticipated so much that anything would have been entertaining for them. Yet there were a few we knew for sure that thought some of it to be lack luster and lifeless as we did. I believe that and other things had something to do with it, not being just one thing.
I believe overall, Harry Potter has lost it's magic.",5,2,3,4 June 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Good and the Bad . . .
","Ya know when you have a film that borders on A & B yet just cant quite make ups its mind? Thats my fast take on this high octane red line effort. Especially if your a youngster into the whole car group racing thing, then your gonna 'Love' this film. Yet if you look deeper to the qualities that make an all around good film, then you'll be a bit dissapointed, yet still you will be entertained. The best part about this film to me was watching for the first time, actor 'Paul Walker' Being a cross resemblance of Timothy Hutton and Rob Lowe, Paul Walker is an actor I'm keeping an eye on. Though I've never seen him, this Southern California native is no stranger to acting and will have me viewing some of his past work. The directing and some of the writing was a bit adolescent yet at times (such as during certain action/race sequences), it made good quarter mile time. No, not a waste of money, especially since finding Paul Walker, yet not a film Vin Diesel should hold up to the light. Worth the watch, worth the video rental, yet it wont be in my collection.",6,0,1,23 June 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Not much more then names
","Ok look, if you have average tools and talent to make something, you'd expect average. At times, there can be a chemistry which would add even something more to it. Yet if you have some of the best, most popular tools with seasoned talent to create, you would expect something special right? Well I didnt see it here. Even with some of the most popular faces, gifted director and publicity machine of war, I experienced a film that was averagely interesting to watch, at best. In my opinion, this films boxoffice reflects only names and hype and I find that cheap. A film experience to me is one that is just that...an experience. One that wisks me up from the beginning while leaving me with it's story still branded in my heart and mind. No wisk or branding here.",6,0,1,17 December 2001
Legends of the Fall," One of the most beautiful films all around I've seen
","8-2-01 There are very good films that have all around chemistry. And there are those great films that have universal special chemistry. Legends of the Fall is definately of the latter. Built from a base so rich in character, this visual story of a families history through prosperity and tragidy is so beautifully expressed from all levels. Brad Pitt has yet to surpass his performance in this film or, will it always be his Gone with the Wind. I still cannot believe he wasnt at least nominated for best actor. Every actor from Anthony to Adian, Ormond to Pitt gushed in Legends, the breath of excellence accompanied with the elegance and talent of the direction and cinematography. A story so rich, so masterfully expressed, so visually breath taking, so brilliantly orchastrated, one knows this kind of film making is by chance and masterful talent. One of my all time favorite films.FC",10,1,3,2 August 2001
No Country for Old Men," Now 'THATS' a quality film
","I won't be writing much more then this... I just came back from seeing this film at the Arclight in Hollywood and must say... I'm sorry I didn't see it earlier, so I could enjoy the after thoughts sooner then now.Directing... writing... the dialog and lack lack there of... acting... cinematography... EVERYTHING about this film was simply top notch quality. The kind of quality that has been missing more and more in our theaters and it's a pleasure to experience another. Yet... will make me once again yearn for the quality exhibited.Thank you Ethan and Joel Coen for a Masterful time at the movies.FilmFan P.S. If this film doesn't get recognized by the Academy, then the 5% faith I've left in them will surely be gone.",9,2,6,9 December 2007
Blue Crush," A well spent fun time
","In short, if your female, 10 to 23, your more then likely going to Luv this film and it's playfulness. 24 through 39, bet you'll relate, relive and appreciate. If your a male in your teens, you'll find it fun with an optical sweetner (and the girls arent bad to look at either) and you guys from your 20's and up can appreciate the visuals and action. It's a well paced film thats fun and visual. Actors are believable and the lead (forgot her name) is natural and comfortable in her portrayal and yes, has a certain something about her face and smile that are wholesome yet naturally beautiful. Will be interesting to see how she develops.It's not a mind twister by any means yet it's not meant to be. A refreshing story with some colorful photography bathed in a grain of sand in life and friendship. Loved the water shots and though are plentyful, I just couldnt seem to get enough. Sappy or corny it surely isnt....fun and visually entertaining it is. Good job to all, my time was well spent.

Meet the Fockers," Meet the 'So So's' I hoped for more
","All in all, not a bad film entertainment wise however I expected something smarter with more humor and execution then there was.Seems Deniro's character lost most of his appeal as well as the whole film turning more into a, 'It's OK...they really liked these characters and situation so much, we don't have to work on it as hard and tons of people will still fill the box office' kinda film.Dustin Hoffman was the most talented of the players and I'm not particularly a fan of his and he entertained me more. Barbra... she should have pick a different film because she came off like a dusty IL' sports car with flat tires and cobwebs yet, no matter how dilapidated it looks, underneath you still believes there's a sports car in there somewhere but it is what ya see, if ya know what I'm talking about.We could have used Stiller stepping it up to keep things really interesting and pick up the slack yet they wrote him a bit toward the back and thats too bad.Just with all the talent and pull they had behind this to make it 'really' funny and entertaining, you'd think they would have. Yet a gun with no bullets is still just a hunk of metal. Naw, they weren't shooting blanks yet the powder was a bit too wet for me.Most of you will probably be happy saying your money was spent well, yet I believe those more hardcore watchers not wanting just a cookie cutter production will be disappointed a bit with the results.6.5 outta 10",7,5,13,22 December 2004
The Pianist," Very well done however...
","Ya know...what I liked most about that film was the piano playing. Truly some excellent playing. It was a good film, kept me there, taught me something. Yet it didn't grab me by the balls and yank me in. There was one main thing amongst a couple that prevented that. The lead actor. If not for him, I believe that film could have been so much more gripping.    He seemed so...'relaxed' with everything that was going on. Oblivious, non effected as he struts around town, in his manicured suit while enemy forces steal foot after foot of it. Everyone was effected in one way or another yet I felt and saw none from him.     While on the lamb, with each person that stuck their necks out on the line for him, he thanked only 'once' that I remember. The German officer pianist. Other then that, I didn't see despair, true fear, anxiety let alone horror. Where was his humility? Thankness in his eyes or even a gesture due these people risking life and limb for his safety.     The only time I saw some sort of connection to what was going on around him was toward the end when he was dirty, bearded, hungry and walking as if an old man. This is when I saw 'some' union with the character that should have been there progressively growing all along. And the sad thing about that was it was the time he hand the least bit of lines.
    Roman Polanski did a good job with this film other then casting and directing the lead. Showed some detail of things we've seldom touched in other films of its subject. The progression to loss of rights not only as citizens yet human beings. Comes to mind is when the Father, walking in the street, was degraded by a slap to the face then forced to walk only in the gutter by that hate monger of a soldier.     Without showing the people dying in the gas chambers or starved to death, he showed the step by step process from the identifying arm bands, to the segregation into a small section only to be walled in. To the scene of herding them to a waiting point for the train to ultimately show the baggage left behind, leaving our memories to paint the gruesome picture of what became them.     I liked the film, I was glad I experienced it yet, of all characters, the lead kept me on the outside preventing me to fall within.",7,0,0,21 January 2003
Hellboy," Surprisingly Funny, Adventurous and Entertaining
","In short, I dont know the comic book character yet Thursday night midnight at Mann's Chinese seemed to be filled with those who did and, they all seemed quite pleased with the results.Ron Pearlman along with everyone else, (special honorable mention to the fish who is voiced by David Hyde Pierce yet played by Jones who shined with each breath) did a really good job however the Director/Screenwriter really made this film worth more then most would think. He had the choice of Blade II or HellBoy and I believe he chose wisely. It kept you interested, well paced and what I liked best...it made ya laugh along with it. Good job to all. This will make it's 60 mill back and quite a bit then some.",7,0,0,2 April 2004
Shrek the Third," It's no Skrek 1 or 2
","I liked the Skrek's however this one is not to par with the other two. It's not as witty, funny, interesting or clever as it's two previous efforts and I was a bit bummed about it. What made it enjoyable enough was the fact I do enjoy the characters and the spirit of the films however I want something to be 'at least' as good and painfully it was not. Just seemed to be missing that certain something as well as a better script. The concept was fine however that was the strongest point. I will say the CGI work and the expressions of the characters were really outstanding. A lil scarily realistic in certain shots. They did improve on that aspect of it yet that's not where the focus should have been. It's a entertaining ride yet not nearly in the league as the first two. So if you go in with lowered expectations, then hopefully you'll come out with no less than feeling your time was well enough spent.",7,8,16,18 May 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," 'Bomb-Bastic' ... Shame too.
","What is wrong here? You'd think the director and writer second time around would get better right? Yea, you'd think but no such luck. Tim Story directed this thing like a newbie while both writers could'not seem to shake corny near senseless dribble. If I was Exec Prod, I'd be one ticked off guy for spending more than 130 million on this. Hell, for 10 million and real talent they could have done so much better.I never felt taken away by this film in any way. No drama, sense of danger or urgency, even from the actors. Like eating spicy buffalo wings made of pink flavored bubble gum. Simply the whole film was a paper tiger of itself.The best about this film... Every scene with the Silver Surfer and the magnetic Dr. Doom, Julian McMahon, whom was used far too less, made you feel like you were took along for the ride. They're the only charismatic, interesting and professional energies in this film.Some effects, like in most fight, Surfer and earthly scenes were pretty impressive. However in the corny, 'oh, let me stretch over here to get those papers' scenes, it looked like Barney Budget scale. And the unfunny cliché after cliché was embarrassing and frustrating.And what's up with Alba's distractingly fake colored Lil Kim contacts? I mean, every time she was on screen, you'd have to fight being distracted from what's going on.Or Mr. Fantastics gray hair changing density and shape with most every shot.That the larger than life 'Thing' Ben Grimm is seemingly reduced to a pint size butterball party favor.The interaction and perception of our hero's with the general public is tapered down like a cheap parlor trick leaving no sense of drama or superiority.Ioan Gruffudd's acting was wimpy and stylized by director Tim Story as if he was in a day time soap opera.Too bad the great possibilities for one of the best comic groups ever thought of, were laid to rest on such an incompetent team that possibly could have ruined it's chances forever.I would have enjoyed myself better watching the animated series from decades ago.",5,146,251,16 June 2007
Men in Black II," No magic, waste of time
","Shortly, seems as though the only thing going for this film is two things... 1, they made a very good first film. 2nd, the dog. Other then that, this film was a total waste of time and money for me. There was no magic between the characters. Just seemed to be going through the motions and banking on the fact they had a great first film. The script was adholecent and the directing...I thought you were supposed to get better with experience however it seems this director gets worse.",4,0,0,16 July 2002
World Trade Center," Powerful... Very well done!
","You know what I haven't got from most films these past couple of years that I 'did' get from this one? Real emotional involvement. Brought 'into' the story more than from just an observers perspective.That sense of real danger, anticipation, pain, urgency. The feeling of Closter phobia when in a tight space. I 'felt' the soot and gravel in my mouth. Oliver Stone did just that throughout this film and no, not due the subject matter.First off, Oliver and writer Andrea Berloff made an interesting, entertaining and well paced film that was also heartfelt. And adding, some things we just take for granted like... being moved.For instance, the sound was incorporated 'so well' in the film. Not giving away, when the team is in the trade center before it comes down, the sound effects 'really' brought you in to where they were. When the second tower was hit and you hear the boom from the inside... you 'feel' it in your chest 'and' senses. When trapped under rubble after the first tower falls, the second one comes down. You FEEL like your right there.I was impressed also by 'most' of the actors. Not a big Nick Cage fan however once again, he portrayed the character very well. Well enough for me to forget he was Nick.Michael Pena (of 'Crash' fame) did a wonderful job portraying officer Will Jimeno. He'll see his actor stock increase by measure for sure. And his job while trapped, not over done, not contrived, very believable and solid.Maria Bello again solidifies her spot as one 'go to' actor when you need a good performance even from a mild character. She really brought something to this role that helped bring strength yet emotion.However, Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance for reasons stuck out negatively for me. I've enjoyed past performances from her however this one seemed more contrived and overplayed from my perspective. The performance seemed to take away from the film far more than it contributed.Overall, with all the hype of it being a film about 9-11, Oliver Stone as director and all else thats been said and mentioned about this film, I'm 'very' glad I went to experience it.They were not gratuitous by trying to play solely on your emotions about 9-11. No, it's about the true story and events surrounding mostly, two men of courage and they're experience on that horrific day, sprinkled just enough with the event that did take place.This film ran us through the emotional coaster on most every facet while entertaining us, educating us and letting us share in other peoples experience while reminding us again of our own.Oliver Stone... no matter what anyone says, you did a justice to this story and very well told in my opinion. Very good job.GO SEE THIS FILM. You'll be moved, entertained and affected for sure.",8,3,8,16 August 2006
Inside Man," Weakly directed and predictable
","You already know what it's about so here's what I did and didn't like about it.Sorry, but this was not some 'whodunnit' or how. It was predictable from the beginning. The only thing I didn't figure out was the 'very' ending however by that time I didn't try because I didn't care.The directing of this film was horrible in my opinion. It was like some great actors and a big budget was given to someone doing they're first film school piece. Trying to throw in something cool from this film and that, that just didn't work. Like the 'Hitchcock' style or the 'move Denzel on the dolly toward the emergency' thing. It just didn't work at all. (you'll know when you see it) Love Jodie Foster however her performance was out of touch, too snitty, and I believe that was from direction. Same with Power House Denzel. This guy can blink and eye lid to convey message however Spike wasted this actors talents along with the others.There were a 'couple' of funny lines here and there yet other than that, I didn't believe the characters... I wasn't on the edge of my seat... I wasn't confused or thrilled by a thing. It was a blasé experience through out.And what's up with the racial stints? I've heard read and seen Spike personally be a racist through the years but why does he have to find it a need to speckle or drown his projects with it? It's like every N.Y. cop is a racist? Come on! I'm so sick of it and it takes away from films when it's a distraction and not a part of the story. In fact, Spike's direction with this film was just like a said, a film student in first year on his first project.And whats with the face masks? Clive Owens is tightly stretched accenting his meaty lips while everyone else's is not. There there are times you see his mask not as perfect as other times. It became so distracting from the film itself.And who is this writer anyway? Not a single credit... not a single thing on biography? Makes me wonder who, if anyone this was that wrote this thing. And smart? Maybe the idea was but from there to paper, weak. Then given to the hands of Spike... even weaker.To me, this was a waste of talented actors and an idea that could have been good yet went south. If there was someone there that could actually have a limber ability toward directing, this could have been a far better film. Instead we get hype and an adolescently helmed film that was a waste of my time.",5,2,7,25 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Weak, no emotional value, no....connection
","No I didn't read the book so this is not an age old comparison of, 'Oh, the book was so much better.' No, this movie simply lacked anything I'd envisioned it would have. An awesome Director, one of the top male actors and a seemingly interesting story line however this film was like plain white bread, without filling the stomach.I believe the biggest problem with this film was the script. Simply sub-par in comparison to all it had going for it with the director, actor and interests that was going for it. I believe the first weekend (as it was) would be exceptional. However now that almost a week has passed, and more than just critics bad reviews are out, I believe the word of mouth of just how bland this film is will drops it's box office to it's knees like a hooker at a millionaires convention. (sorry, first thing that came to mind) Either way, I wanted this to be a good film yet as much as I hoped, as much leeway I gave it, it was a waste of my time. Ron Howard... no special touch as in his past films. Tom Hanks.. pound for pound one of the top actors out there yet he seemed to contribute not a thing any other actor could have. And again the script... they should have brought someone in far better because he really helped sink this film.The only real point of interest at all.... Paul Bettany. His character was very interesting and he did a very, very good job with it. However not nearly enough to save this 'could of been' film.",5,1,4,25 May 2006
Signs," Better then II not as good as I
","(A couple spoilers so....) Seems most 'really' like this film however I have too many checks that put it down the list. I hope M. takes a back seat on putting himself in his films. The more he's there, the more of a distraction he is. He's not a good actor by any means however he's not bad yet a distraction. I believe if he drops the production side it will strengthen his directing and writing. Yet if he went a step further, I'd like to see what he does simply directing someone elses story and production. Beleive this would show more of what I believe he has. That said, the film was pleasurable in some areas yet weak in others. Phoenix was, as usual, strong in his performance. In fact he and the lil girl were the standouts of the film. Mel, as much as I love him, was average if not below, Mel. Story was interesting for a change and thought it flowed fairly well yet dragged in a couple areas. Some humorous points, a bag or two in fact while still having some spooky aspects about it. For me, it got a bit weak when the (Spoil) Aliens came a knockin. Just didnt connect for me. I didnt 'feel' the threat, I didnt believe the newcasts, I didnt fear anything. Just wasnt put there ya know? I felt like I was watching it from a distance and 'knew' everything was gonna be allright. I mean, this alien is smart enough to travel the universe but stands there while the Babe Ruth could have been, grabs his link to who he once was off the wall, winds up for what seems two minutes and lets him plummel him? They're smart enough to get here, check out fields all over the world yet what is their lethal achillies heal, know nothing about? Like...it 'RAINS HERE AND IF IT EVEN TOUCHES US, WE'LL DIE' Sooooo......why would I fear them? Sorry, just didnt knock my ball outta the park.So, over all it's surely above average but nothing special. Worth the price of the ticket at least. Surely not a Frank Darrabont Shawshank Redemtion or even a David Fincer Fight Club directorial magic. And I believe he can. Less will give you more M.   Concentrate on your potential magic with your Directing abilities.",7,0,1,9 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," 'X' didnt mark the spot for me... (no plot spoilers)
","Pun intended... X-Men II lost it's 'Mystique' the second time around. From the very start of the film, you can visually see somethings different. From the camera angles to the lighting, that bigger then life image is no where to be seen. Simply, the emotional texture that once existed was somewhere lost in the fray. Like most films these days, the opening sequence bursts onto the screen with welcomed flare and life, only then to muddle through a wondering filler script for the next 30 to 40 minutes leaving you far too long in anticipation for another burst. Each burst to come... mostly road side flares instead of 4th of July sky explosions. The concept they were going for was understood and well intended however with a weak script coupled with too many variations left the characters sadly to become part of the machine instead of the machine itself.
Plainly, you dont feel the power of, and the connection too the characters as you did in the first one. The general idea was good yet they came up too many yards short of a touchdown though they did accomplish to squeeze a couple of first downs here and there. Yea, if I were you and you are an X-Men fan, then go see it. However if you go in with lowered expectations, you wont feel quite as short changed. There's room for another and I hope they go for it yet...bring back the chemistry lost within the reel of the first. fc",7,0,0,2 May 2003
Unbroken," Great Story...Weakly told
","If given some of the worlds most incredible ingredients to make a meal, why would anyone instead choose to make a ground beef burger? Well,Angelina Jolie and the Coen brothers did just that!There is so much to this story yet so much is not only left out, yet not told nearly to the caliber it should and could have been. Instead I found myself looking at my watch, hoping for more to be revealed yet the gifted storytelling done in the book and needed here was simply not in the hands of those it needed to be. I'd hope that someone more talented would have done this, in fact I wish it could be redone however that's not going to happen, sadly. What an opportunity, wasted.",4,13,26,28 December 2014
The Pursuit of Happyness," Wanting a full meal yet only being served soup

Got a bit of the two however not nearly enough.Simply put, it was attractive from the outside yet hollow from within. It ran too long and the script just wasn't up to par. That was the major failure to this film.Like they had all the components... decent directing, great story potential, interesting actors however it's like once they had that, they found it hard to fill in between the beginning and end. It just didn't have enough interest so the story drug on with the same dynamic (which wasn't all do dynamic) It's a decent film yet don't expect too much from it and you may not be 'too' disappointed. Too bad too because it really could have been so much more if they had a better script.",6,8,27,15 December 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Shaky camera almost ruins strong follow up to 'Bourne Identity'
","What really kept this film from becoming what it really could have, was the tiresome over-use of the, 'shaky camera' syndrome.I mean come on, it was like Katherine Hepburn shooting from atop a circus ball in a mudslide on a stormy day. (No disrespect for our beloved Hepburn) It has it's place however too much of a good thing can be bad and that's what happened here. It took away from many moments including, the fight scenes.      As in the first Bourne, the action was quick yet settled enough to let you absorb what was happening while keeping the effect. Here, two monkeys could have been flailing around and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Why the need for so much cover up instead of taking the effort to choreograph some smart and believable sparring? It was truly effective in the first Bourne and should have been kept along the original spirit. Yes we understand different Directors have their own niche so, I'm saying Greengrass and his niche wasn't as Bourne as Director Liman.     It was an interesting story and I believe writer Tony Gilroy did a good job, even humorous at times which played very well. Yet I would like to have seen a bit more that unpretentious and natural physical combat and clever side winding as in the first. Still, it was an interesting film, though it was done pretty well yet still fell short of my hopes.
     Damon was made for this and like roles and again an excellent character portrayal. Being a stud without trying to be, is just what this part needed and Matt does a great job at it. As far as I'm concerned, it's about time Damon finds another part of his stride. I hope he continues a while along this path.     All in all Damon and writer Gilroy were the best aspects of this film. Not quite enough to make it what it should have, but they did a good job in making up the best they could for Greengrass' minor mistake in vision, that made a very big impact.7/10",7,0,1,23 July 2004
Cinderella Man," Good film yet, Overrated.
","Sure, Ron Howard Directing, Russle Crow in the lead, Rene Zellwigger thrown in along with a riches to rags to riches story, how could it loose? Well, it doesn't loose in my opinion however, it's not the big winner people in this first weekend hype are touting it to be.With people and a storyline of that nature, along with the pre-payed media comments you'd expect this to be another Beautiful Mind, but it's not.Well shot and well acted, this film still has enough to grab you yet there's not that special quality that breaks it from a 'good' film to a 'Special' film. I like all kinds of films yet I have to say, Rocky is still a better put together film that touches the sad and excited emotions than this one.If it attracts you, go and see it yet don't be too excited about it and maybe you'll walk away with a little better experience. In comparison, I believe 'Crash' is by far the better film in the writing, directing, acting and overall emotional experience.",7,1,6,4 June 2005
