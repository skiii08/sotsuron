Hereditary," Realistic!
","Ive read so many bad reviews here about this film. I agree about some of them, but at least u should appreciate Toni Collette's acting.What makes this film so good for me ? It really makes me stress. Unlike typical jumpscare movie. This is so different than any other horror movies.",9,0,4,18 May 2019
