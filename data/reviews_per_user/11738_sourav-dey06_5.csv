The Hangover," Awesome!! Mindblowing!! 10Thumbs UP!!!
","I saw this movie very recently on a DVD and now I regret as to why and how I missed it theatrically. Its amazing movie, and I totally fell in love with the characters. God, may be I liked the movie 'coz there has been many occasions when I have landed in the same situation where I completely lost my mind and woke up the next morning remembering nothing. Hahaha!!!! And really the situation becomes really embarrassing when there are people around you who saw me doing all f***ing funny things and were completely on their perfect mind. Hhahaha .I recommend this movie to everybody. This is really a great movie and you will laugh to every bit part of its one liners. Great Job!!! Though the movie is essentially a Male Movie, and I am damn sure almost 90% of the lot would find (at least a tiny bit) of their life's fun in it!!! Thanks a lot Warner Bros.",10,4,8,13 August 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Gloriously Inglorious
","This film is in one word 'spectacular'. This one is the second best work of Tarantino after Pulp Fiction. The film is completely entertaining and evokes thoughts among the audiences too. All the five chapters and the connections between them, and how he builds the film over those chapters which on its own are small movies, just like episodes, are a work of sheer talent. This man knows how to make films. He is indeed a storyteller, and I doubt this credibility in any other contemporary directors. As expected the climax was just too good as all his other movies. Its a pleasure watching Tarantino. The film builds on its dialogues, and I would strongly suggest anyone watching this piece listen them, you will definitely enjoy the true essence of the film only if you don't miss any of its dialogue. Although I must mention that the film is a bit long, and I felt anxious rather boring. And hats off Mr. Waltz!! You were wonderful a basterd or bastard whatever it be... [:)] Must watch for film lovers.",9,1,10,4 October 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man," Why on earth did you use the name 'Spiderman'? Ans - To earn Money
",horrible movie ..... worst special effect in a $200mn movie till date .... horrible 3D ... horrible acting by leading pair .... it seemed that spidey was more keen to let people know who he actually is ... no alter ego .... the movie is really a joke ... seriously people don't waste your money on this crap like I did!! ... I just don't get the point why people these days have a tendency to put anything in a movie and start selling it ... the movie has no resemblance to the comic book ... its sad .... and why name it spiderman?? you could have created a new superhero with this storyline .... but no!!! you need to earn money using the name.,1,12,37,1 July 2012
Avatar," WoW!!
","This is just spectacular. Amazing!! I watched the movie in first time in 2D and then on 3D. Even on 2D its amazing but 3D just takes the breath away.Story wise there is nothing much. The same good over evil, but the effects are really breathtaking. 3Times thumbs Up for such a spectacular SFX. Th movie really takes the benchmark of animations to the next level, and all other movies to follow are bound to get a comparison to this.Amazing use of colours and vivid visual elaboration creates an eye soothing affair for the audiences.A must watch at least once, but of course 3D is what the movie is meant to be.",9,3,8,18 December 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Not Good
","I expected much after the Death hallows Part 1, but this one did not impress me. Although the effects were good but somewhere i felt disconnected. Frankly speaking Daniel can't act. Rupert and Emma are far far better than him. He is the weakest link in the film. And Alan Rickman gives a stunning performance throughout the franchisee. For me the story didn't turn up fascinating. I may be personal but definitely this wasn't what i expected this franchisee to end. The effects only can not make a film. If we are talking at effects then see lord of the rings. In acting part too it was far more superior to harry series. Probably this whole Harry series was a over hype after all. Again saying and I make it a statement Daniel can't act. Rupert and Emma has a great career ahead. Daniel will end up being just another Child Artist. Just like Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone series.",Null,0,0,16 July 2011
