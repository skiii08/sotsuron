Miracle," Best movie I have ever seen
","This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I hope everyone goes out and sees this movie when it hits the theatre.  There wasn't a dry eye, even though everyone knew what was going to happen.  It was a touching tribute to the late Herb Brooks, an amazing coach that took a bunch of college hockey players and beat the most powerful hockey powerhouse the world had ever seen.",10,0,1,1 February 2004
