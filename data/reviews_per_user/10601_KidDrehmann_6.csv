The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie Ever
","There are absolutely no words to describe the full percentage of enjoyment I received from this movie. The Avengers is phenomenal. Joss Whedon beautifully and artfully collaborates all of the greatness and magnitude of all the films leading to this one and directs an near exact adaptation of what Marvel always hoped the Avengers would look like on the big screen. To call this film an utter triumph would be a gross under-exaggeration. Containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film, the wittiest and most hilarious humor I have seen, and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema. Comic book fans and creators will leave theaters in an ecstasy of awe and amazement. May 4, 2012 should be marked down in the history books as the day comic book films successfully reached true perfection.",10,10,21,5 May 2012
Captain Marvel," The Bigger Conflict Still Looms
","This is less of a Captain Marvel specific review, and more of a review of the last two MCU movies with an emphasis on Captain Marvel.I was worried for both Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Captain Marvel being placed in between Infinity War, and Endgame. My worry was that the movies wouldn't be as appreciated since they are basically filler episodes for the main conflict that has still yet to be resolved. I was right. That's certainly not a very big knock on either movie considering they were both still pretty good. Ant-Man suffered from taking place at the same time as Infinity War, so we were really only interested in how Infinity War's result affected that movie's ending. Captain Marvel takes place in the 1990s, so there is a lack of suspense in a sense considering we as an audience know who of the more central characters make it out of the movie already.That being said, Captain Marvel was still very good. The plot itself leaves a little more to be desired as it is your basic amnesia/am I on the right side story which makes it predictable. Also, knowing ahead of time that they were going to make Carol the strongest hero to date made the climax at bit underwhelming. The third act does make up for a lot of the movie though, and gets back into that classic MCU feel we all love.",9,7,19,8 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I Think I Might Actually Hate A Star Wars Movie
","Fan backlash ruined this movie. All the pressure put on this franchise because fans didn't get what they wanted forced Abrams to make choppy, uncoordinated mess filled with inconsistencies, and extensive fan service. The pandering is almost as bad as the dialogue. What should have been a new, creative entry in the series ends up being essentially Return of the Jedi all over again. Did they grab some 'super fan' to write awful fan fiction as the script? That's what it seemed like. The movie is all over the place. Routinely is new information, and abilities lobbed in there lackadaisically with no real context, or need. I seriously never thought I could hate a Star Wars movie. I'm disappointed, but at least maybe now they don't have to worry about pandering anymore. Maybe",5,3,8,20 December 2019
Inception," The Best And Most Original Movie Of The Year
","Inception, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies that I have ever had the privilege of seeing. It is original, clever, action-packed, and thrilling.The acting is great, however unlike most DiCaprio films this movie doesn't rely on him carrying the weight of the entire thing on his shoulders. It is very evenly distributed among his fellow cast members, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Tom Hardy especially. The storyline is incredibly creative and astonishingly original proving this to be better than Nolan's Batman entries by a long shot. Even from the beginning of the film there is plenty of action that continues on throughout its entirety and steadily grows greater and greater as well as better towards the film's end. And though very small there are a few comedic moments in the movie courtesy of Gordon-Levitt. The movie itself I believe is a much more exciting and successful combination of James Bond, The Matrix, and Ocean's Eleven.To sum it all up you should not miss seeing this movie in theaters or at all. It is the best movie this year by far beating out all the other blockbusters in 2010 as well as my favorites from this year. You would be missing out on, as the title says, the best and most original movie of the year.",10,3,7,19 July 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," An Amazing End to an Exceptional Trilogy
","Christopher Nolan delivers his final chapter of the Batman saga in spades. Leaving no loose ends (well maybe one) and given fans of both the movies and the comics exactly what they wanted and desired from this movie. The Dark Knight Rises passes its predecessor in virtually every way and Tom Hardy gives a performance so well and convincing that it will lead you to believe he is the real life incarnation of Bane. With eye boggling special effects and a beautifully crafted plot, Batman's last entry will leave you craving for more. Nolan finally gives Batman what his comic book writers never could: an ending. What else can I say? Go see this movie. You will not regret it.",10,2,6,20 July 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Absolutely Outstanding
","There are no words to express how amazing this movie was. What one would assume would be a typical horror clich√© is actually treated to one of the most creative movies I've ever seen. Although most people could expect what the movie contained from the previews, as I did, they will still be blow away by this movie. Not from the acting or directing or anything like that, but from the pure originality of the movie. The last horror movie I remember seeing that was this original, inventive, and down right badass was Scream, and with a equally satisfying deliverance of it's gritty, gory, grisly, and tongue in cheek attitude. Anyone who goes to see this movie will surely get their money's worth and then some.",10,264,528,13 April 2012
