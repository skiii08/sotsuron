The Devil's Advocate," Best film of 1997
","This was a classic Hollywood Movie. It had many different genres blended splendidly together. Excellent acting by Pacino, Theron and a good job from Reeves. Most literate, well directed and written. Was not marketed very well. It is a shame that this movie did not do well at the box office. Well, what do except from people who flock to see 'Something About Mary' and 'The Waterboy!'",10,1,1,7 December 1998
