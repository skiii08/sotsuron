Requiem for a Dream," Horrible yet beautiful
","An amazing film that follows four souls into the horrible depths of addiction and it's consequences. Darren Aranofsky has done a wonderful job of transferring Hubert Selby Jr's amazing novel to the screen (if you like this movie do yourself a favor and read the book.) Aranofsky beautifully transfers Selby's characters and makes the viewer sympathize and feel even for characters who have no redeeming qualities. All of the performances are absolutely first rate. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are completely convincing as out of control addicts. Ellen Burstyn is simply amazing as the lonely mother who trades one addiction (food and TV) for one much more terrible, her performance is mesmerizing and haunting.This film is hard to watch; it's painful, it's gutwrenching, it's horrible and it is also beautifully perfect in every way. THIS is movie making at it's best. (10/10)",10,0,1,6 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Does it live up to 16+ years of anticipation? Yes!
","I just got out of the Charity screening of Phantom (kudos to George Lucas on a great idea.) I must say the movie lived up to my expectations. Phantom is much more obviously a part of a continuing story than 'A New Hope' was; it leaves many questions unanswered and many unasked. Where 'A New Hope' could have stood on it's own without the sequels it seems the true greatness of Phantom Menace will come out as the next two movies are released. Fantastic special effects, awesome fight scenes between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul and a very good story (which will only get better and more evolved as the sequels come out) make this a definite must see.",10,0,1,16 May 1999
Unbreakable," Better than 6th Sense, but... (very minor spoiler)
","Let me preface this by saying I wasn't very impressed with 6th Sense, I thought it was a very average movie with a surprise ending; nothing more. Unbreakable on the other hand was interesting throughout with a somewhat disappointing ending. I liked the story and all of the performances, but the movie seemed to be a ruined cause once the disappointing 'surprise' ending was revealed. I heard this weekend that Unbreakable may be the first in a series of movies based on these characters (I actually heard Willis said this was the first of a trilogy); if this is the case Unbreakable will become better as part of a larger story.Still, despite what I saw as a disappointing ending, I liked the movie as a whole and will like it better if it does turn out to be just a first installment of a larger story.(8/10)",9,0,0,25 November 2000
The Mummy," Awful
",I went in expecting very little and was still disappointed. The bad acting and horrible dialog continually distracted from the special effects (the only decent part of the film.) And now I see they are making a 'The Mummy 2'? I guess any big budget film that somehow makes over $100million gets a sequel now (no matter how abysmal the original.),2,1,4,3 April 2000
X-Men," Very good!
","Was it worth the wait? Well, I read my first X-Men comic 20+ years ago and dreamed of a movie since then, so probably not; but it is a very good movie. It is true to the comic, with an actual story to go along with the action and special effects. The acting is strong, Stewart (Prof. X) and McKellen (Magneto) give their usual strong performances but it is Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) who really steals the show. Jackman IS Wolverine. The rest of the cast does a good, if somewhat under-used, job; I hope future sequels will better use the under-appreciated Halle Berry (Storm). As a longtime X-Men and movie fan I definitely recommend this movie. As an aside, do now worry if you do not know they 'mythos' behind the X-Men, it is adequately explained throughout the movie.",9,0,0,14 July 2000
Elf," Not great but some very good laughs
","I saw Elf this weekend with my nephews (ages 8 & 10) and was pleasantly surprised. I loved Will Ferrell on SNL but the commercials for Elf left me thinking this might not be a very good film. The story was kind of slow/corny in some parts (especially the end) but for the most it kept me and my nephews laughing.A must see if you are a Ferrell fan, this is classic Ferrell hamming.(8/10)",8,0,1,29 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Perfect
","When I first heard about a movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books I was a little wary, I didn't believe such a master-work could be transfered to the big screen and still keep all of the little bits that made you love the characters and the story. But Peter Jackson has done just that, he has created a masterpiece and, by far, the best fantasy movie ever. Usually when watching a big budget sci-fi/fantasy movie the special effects are constantly catching your attention and dominating the movie. In this movie the special effects are almost incidental (though they are simply amazing), the story and characters drive this movie, not the special effects. Each actor IS his character, every location seems to have magically popped out of the book and the world of Middle Earth seems as real as the one outside the window.Perfect(10/10)",10,1,2,14 June 2003
The Thing," The DVD version makes a classic even better
",Tremendously scary with great special effects. If you like this movie be sure to check out the DVD version for all of the extra features and cut scenes.,10,0,1,31 October 1998
Face_Off," Complete garbage
","The only thing more ridiculous than the idiotic plot was Travolta's constant overacting. I spent the entire movie rolling my eyes as the 'plot' came up with more and more contrived ways to let Travolta play the insane guy. And the ending....John Woo should be ashamed of himself, what a total waste of time.(1/10)",1,4,9,18 February 2002
The Fast and the Furious," The horror!
","I finally saw this on Starz this weekend. Boy am I glad I didn't pay to see it at the theaters.EVERYTHING about this movie is terrible. You would think that if they were going to make a movie about street racing they would at least get that part right but not in this case. The depiction of street racing is completely moronic (these guys are doing 160 on crowd lined public streets for minutes at a time, idiotic.) Apparently as little research went into the topic of the film as went into the ridiculous script and the hunt for actual actors (saying this cast were bad actors would be a slap to the face of bad actors everywhere.) So, THIS is the movie that made Vin Diesel a 'star'?! This movie goes to prove that his horrible acting in Pitch Black was no fluke, he really is as wooden as a 2x4.
1/10 (too bad there is not a 0/10 option)P.S. I really thought it would be a LOOOONG time before I saw another 'big' movie worse than Battlefield Earth, but this POS only made me wait one year and makes Battlefield Earth play like Citizen Kane.",1,2,8,4 August 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Mission: Impossible - Finding a decent script
","No matter how many stylish explosions, gunfights and special effects John Woo put into this film it still boils down to nothing more than a hackneyed, boring movie. Don't waste your money, wait for it on HBO.(2/10)",2,0,0,21 November 2000
The Mummy Returns," A steaming pile of...
","OK, I hated the 'first' mummy and went into this one (dragged by a group of friends out for a Friday movie) expecting more of the same (stupid plot, bad acting and great special effects.) Boy did I get all of that in spades. It sickens me that a movie with such a completely hideous plot and script can rake in money like this one has so far. This movie is a perfect example of the movie going audience sending a message to the studios saying, 'don't worry about an interesting story, don't worry about descent acting, don't worry about having characters that you care about, just crank up the CGI machines and let special effects carry your films.' I can already hear the bean counters in Hollywood slapping together a 2-cent script and booting up the SGI machines for 'The Mummy Returns Again'.(3/10) (8 for special effects, -5 for everything else)",3,0,0,12 May 2001
The Sixth Sense," Why the hype?
","This, to me, was nothing more than a average film with an odd ending. I had heard how great the movie was and after hearing it was nominated as best picture I figured it should be pretty good; I was disappointed. I watched the DVD (I, surprisingly, had not heard about the ending) and cannot understand the uproar and acclaim this movie has gotten. I found myself bored with the plot and the characters most of the way through and the ending, though somewhat surprising, didn't make up for an overall average film. I kept waiting for the plot to get interesting to justify all of the acclaim and it just never happened. Solid acting, average script and a surprising ending do not make a classic, this was definitely not one of the top 5 movies of '99 (how this was nominated and not Magnolia is beyond me) and certainly not in the top 20 of all time (as IMDB voting would suggest.)",5,2,3,22 May 2000
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Horrible but it's better than the first two
","Unfortunately I was roped into taking my sisters to this and New Moon (and saw the first movie as they watched the DVD over and over.) After the first two movies I was actually a little surprised by this one; sure there is still the terrible acting, the average special effects and the sappy 'love' story (seriously, when is Edward going to fess up to Bella that he's really gay and that's why he won't 'seal the deal'?).I was able to get past what I knew was coming and find some enjoyment in the slightly dark tinge this movie added with Victoria and her army. I've always thought DB Howard was a pretty boring actor but she definitely brought something to this movie.I still thought it was pretty darn bad but at least I didn't spend the whole 2 hours actively hating everyone on the screen and looking at my watch.",3,25,51,30 June 2010
Gladiator," Best Picture? Huh?!
","Probably the worst movie to ever win the best picture Oscar (certainly the worst I've seen.) Sure, the action is fun, the acting and directing are solid and the special effects are nice, but 'best picture'? The script for Gladiator leaves so much to be desired that everything the movie has going for it was not enough to keep me interested with the characters and the story.A 'fun' popcorn movie, but no way does it deserve the best picture Oscar (even with the dearth of good movies in 2000.)just another overhyped, big budget Hollywood movie.(6/10 )",3,0,1,2 April 2001
