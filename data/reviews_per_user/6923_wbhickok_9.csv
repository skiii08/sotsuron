Scarface," BOOOORRRRIINNNG!
","There is very little to like about this movie, Al Pacino as a Cuban refuge?! God, gimmie a break. Only 'The Conquerors' with John Wayne as Genghis Khan is more laughably miscast. Pacino's (over)acting wavers between lampoonish and just plan embarrassing. It is amazing that a movie can last three hours, and have absolutely nothing happen! Terrible in all extremes. Watch the 1932 version with Paul Muni instead.",3,6,13,18 May 2001
L.A. Confidential," A major dissapointment
","When I first heard that LA Confidential was being made into a movie, I was at first excited, so I re-read James Ellroy's book. Then I was depressed that a movie was being made, because I knew it wouldn't even come close to the epic novel. Yeah...yeah... I know, don't say it. 'The book is always better than the movie.' Well then, forget the movie and read the book! I sat dumbfounded watching this movie trying to figure if the characters on the screen were supposed to be the same ones  adapted from the book. The ONLY character who even remotely the same was Ed Exley played by Russell Crowe, and any similarity between Jack Vinsenze in print and on film is purely coincidental. The only people who think that this movie is any good, are those that haven't read the book. Take my advice boys and girls, read the book, you'll have no desire to watch this film ever again.",4,5,15,17 March 2001
The Shining," Overrated
","Like a vast majority of Stephen King books, this one also transfers to film poorly. The only people who like this film, are those that haven't read the book. If they did, they would realize how banal this film is. There are some nice 'Kubrickian' touches, but the director himself later called this his worst movie, which it is. Those that were scared by it, would probably be scared of Mr. Rogers on valium. If you REALLY want to have the bejesus scared out of you, trust me, read the book.",3,1,6,16 May 2001
Duck Soup," One of the all time greats.
","I cannot recall seeing any movie in the past twenty years that has given me more laughs than this movie. I have watched this over twenty times, and I still LOL throughout the entire movie. What is so great about the Marx Brothers was there timing, it really was flawless. The mirror sequence is one of the most memorable moments in all of film history. The Marx Brothers are also timeless, they will be remembered for a long, long time. A film that everybody should see.Upon reflection 'Midnight Run' is one of the funniest movies of the last twenty years...But not as good as 'Duck Soup'",10,0,0,25 May 2001
From Hell," Why Ian why?...
","First off, let me state that the person behind this script knows very little about the Jack The Ripper killings. I have bad news for people out there, Sir William Gull was NOT Jack The Ripper. I am not saying I know who is, many theories abound, but the 'Queen Victoria sending her personal physician out to kill the prostitutes that gave her son VD' is one of the more laughable. Secondly, Johnny Depp simply could not emit a convincing British accent. Don't get me wrong, he is a damn good actor, but he was in way over his head with this one.If you need to see a good Jack The Ripper movie, I would recommend Hitchcocks' 'The Lodger'",3,10,20,21 November 2001
Titanic," Pablum for the brain dead masses.
","Really, why all the commotion over this movie? This schmaltzy soap opera bubble gum puke is way overlong, with every character some cartoon cliche'. With dialouge so frickin' corny that just made me want to throw a brick through my TV screen. Even at the end, that rotten, stupid cow could have let Leo share the plank she was on, but no, she decides to let him die! What the hell is up with that! When are people going to realize that all the special effects in the world aren't going to compensate for jejune scripts such as this one. It too bad that Cameron didn't line a few bird cages with his script to this manipulative, sugar coated bore-feast, if he would have, it would have put to good use.",1,12,26,19 May 2001
Con Air," La Creme De La Crap
","This movie may very well be the epitome of the brainless, contrived action flick.  Nicolas Cage (convicted of a crime he didn't commit, naturally) looks like Fabio's anemic half-brother, posing for GQ and spouting Schwarzeneggeresque lines that will leave you dumbfounded, while John Malkovich has apparantly learned to act in his sleep. Stupid, does not begin to explain this movie, but stupid is how felt because I actually watched the whole damn thing.",1,4,12,6 July 2001
The Matrix," Free your mind....and turn off this junk.
","Even as far as Hollywood films go, this plot is for the birds. Yeah yeah, I know.. it's Sci-Fi, but it still amazes me the way some people drool and applaud rancid pablum like this. All they need is some over-rated FX, one over-rated actor, and the dumbest storyline of all time, and you have people lining up at the door, barking for more. There is good Sci-Fi, and there is bad Sci-Fi. This film definitely falls into the latter. For all of you yahoo's eagerly awaiting the sequel, try something new, read a book. (If you can read)",3,3,8,11 May 2001
Gladiator," Best Movie!!?? Gimmie a break!
","I can't say that I was really surprised when this movie won best picture. Hollywood long ago stopped awarding films that have any merit and only award films that make them money. Even saying that, to give this insipid junk any kind of recognition proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the academy awards are a pathetic farce. As far as battle scenes go, they weren't bad, but the rest of the film is a total bore, did the writers really think they were being clever by naming the title character Maximus!!?? Wow! How clever! Skip this movie. It stinks.",4,0,1,8 May 2001
