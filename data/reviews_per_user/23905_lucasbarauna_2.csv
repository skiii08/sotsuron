Mission: Impossible III," What a great movie
","Well people...I have to say...I was expecting this movie a lot... Not because of Tom Cruise, one of my favorite actors...but because JJ. Abrahms got direction here...I was expecting a movie of this great worker in action, as i saw it in Lost... And yeah...for sure my expectations got done...JJ is a master of non-stop action as we can see in this movie...126 minutes of pure action and of great scenes without a lot of special effects as in MI:2... Here we have a story of a man looking for a real love...a real woman and he's in love with measureless... Besides that...we can see a surprising thing... All supporting holes are great...Fishbourne finally convinced me that he's such a great actor...Johnathan Myers did well too and Monaghan was a mystery for me, and now i think she's a good actress too... Well Seymour Hoffman for me was a little disappointing...I Thought he was a little robotic and not feeling well to act with Tom Cruise supporting him... OK...Womens here are great..Beauty queens at all..as expected in this kind of movie... Finally i'd like to say that Abrahms can be very proud of this picture...and with that he assure us that stardom is not a surprise for him... OK..Bond movies are a little bit out of date and MI-3 is the answer that we are seeking for...(Bourne did well too) Bond..step back...Abrahms will get there",8,2,3,7 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Despite an awful beginning, it's a pretty good movie
","Well, another blockbuster rises in a lot of movie rooms spread the world:The Da Vinci Code...As a fan of movies with great investments...of course i ran into a cinema to see that one.. First of all, i'd like to say that i read the book, so my expectations was about a great job, because that story was easy to transport for a movie set...(it's fluid and dynamic...) Talking about the picture, we can see some disappointing things: In the beginning, the story told, was too fast(some people that were watching with me, realized that too),and Tom Hanks, was a little bit confusing in his 'work'...he was a little embarrassed with all that speech, about symbolist and that audience behind him, was disgusting..i have to tell...seems like people taken out of streets that never saw that pictures and opinionated about that..for God sake,they were too superficial... After that,when Langdon(Tom) received an advise asking him to go to Louvre Museum, i felt some insecurity action between Langdon and Fache(Jean Reno)...seems like chemistry was awful in the set... In Louvre action, all things happened too fast, something that was cleared in the book, that never happened in that way...It was like Langdon and Sophie were genius...and somewhere, somehow,they had a mystical power to discover everything that happened there...another time...a superficial sequence... In the bank, things get a little bit better,Langdon and Sophie seemed more connected and with some tenderness between them...Finally the movie become to take off, and begins to satisfy the audience... After that,when Langdon and Sophie searched for Teabing, things get a lot better and the picture, becomes more substantial with all flashbacks about Langdon and Sophie lives'...It seems that director Ron Howard could make himself comfortable after that point... Well, i won't talk about the rest of the movie because i don't want to freak out other people that wants to see, so let's talk about the cast: Tom Hanks-I Think he had a disappointing performance here,he is much better in other movies,and with no time to improvise he seems a little bit robotic...just in last five minutes you see how great actor he is... Audrey Tatou: A lovely surprise...i thought that she won't have ability to act with Tom...but she's much better than he is in this movie...Deep performance...a lot like Sophie in the book... Ian Mckellen:Maybe, the best actor here...got all maniacs of Teabing and transported well to the screen...Excellent..I will see X-MEN:The Last Stand,in some way because of him... Jean Reno:An slightly disappointing performance...i fought he would be better...Maybe next time... Paul Bettany:He is perfect...Great...An Oscar nomination isn't a grievance for this man...All movies that i saw him, he's acting great...Excellent work...He deserves stardom... All other performances were good too,and besides that,they weren't so important... Finally,i wish for people that didn't see this movie, to have fun...Don't go with great expectations...this is not a favorite for an Academy Award nomination...",6,1,4,19 May 2006
