The Equalizer," So boring I fell asleep
","Seriously, it was that bad. Normally, a movie featuring so many guns and spilling so much blood would get my attention, but the action sequences were just dumb. From beginning to the end, the whole thing felt like a mindless grind. And you could tell from the sticky performances of the actors that they thought the project was stupid too. But with a $50 million budget, it must have been a nice payday for everyone involved and so they went through the motion to get the movie done.Denzel Washington shows his age and is unconvincing as a super assassin. He is too rotund around the waist for people to believe that he has the quick moves needed to get the kills. Washington is best suited for a movie like 'Flight' where he played a bitter and washed up alcoholic. For his own sake, he should either get in shape or turn down these action roles.'The Equalizer' should never have been made. There is no need to insult the audience with this kind of trash. Unfortunately, it is rumored that they are making a sequel. Save your money and give this one a pass.",1,19,40,22 February 2015
If I Stay," Sappy, teenage love story
","ChloÃ« Grace Moretz gave a decent performance and that is why I did not rate this movie lower. The underlying theme is a straight forward teenage romance with two very encouraging parents who seem more than thrilled that their daughter has bagged a punk rock lead singer of a local Portland band. Much of the film is basically run of the mill teenage fantasy fluff that was intended to appeal to the youth demographic. This is the kind of movie that money minded studio executives dream up and from their success at the box office, they got what they wanted.The thematically heavier material like death, out of body experience and the bereavement of losing all of one's family is strangely only incidental and treated as an appendage to the teenage love story. Sixteen year olds looking to get laid on a date my have use for this material, but I would give this film a pass if are looking to be entertained or thoughtfully provoked.",4,3,7,19 February 2015
The Maze Runner," Perhaps the sequel will be better
","Hollywood loves teenage movie franchises like 'Twilight' and 'Hunger Games'. 'The Maze Runner' is clearly intended to be a money maker with many more episodes to come. This is why audiences were basically left hanging with just the faintest clue of what might have happened before. Watching this film is not satisfying because you will have to watch the sequel to know what happens next. For the producers, that is probably the point.As a young person's film it is not that bad but you would be better off spending your money on a picture that is not just another take on plutocratic dystopia. The characters were undemanding and for most part the actors just had to be young, pretty and full of angst. There was nothing all that interesting being portrayed other than the usual teenage fantasy about changing the world and saving everyone.",3,0,1,21 February 2015
Lucy," Plays like a bad Asian gangster movie
","The underlying premise is just stupid. 'Limitless' was a film that was also built around the idea of accessing and using more of our brain's capacity. In 'Limitless', the result was genius, which is believable and watchable. But in 'Lucy', the result was supernatural powers like psychokinesis and mind control.I would surmise that money to make this movie came from criminal syndicates in Taiwan and Korea. Perhaps this is why the movie ends up with Korean gangsters slaughtering Western low life junkies in Taiwan. A lot of the action depicted by these gangsters were simply cut and paste from the tiresome genre of Asian gangster movies. There was nothing original.Were it not for its big budget and special effects, I would have given this a 2 out of 10 rating.",4,2,6,19 February 2015
