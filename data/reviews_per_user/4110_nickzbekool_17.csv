Gone Baby Gone," Highly masterful
","A new crime masterpiece from actor Ben Affleck. Brilliant, gritty, twisting, realistic and haunting. It takes place in the underbelly of Boston. Amy Ryan gives a much deserved Oscar nominated performance as a coke addict mom whose daughter is kidnapped. Which escalates a huge story and a huge search. 2 detectives are assigned to find her. It seems as just a normal kidnapping. Ed Harris in a commanding performance helps them find her and Morgan Freeman is the sheriff. Cules are found, people are blamed. But there is a huge twist that is so unpredictable. Nothing is what it seems, and who can you trust? If you like a mysteriously neo- noir type film or a gritty and unforgettable crime drama that packs a huge bang this is it. It will have you debating and talking for days.",10,0,1,16 February 2008
American Hustle," a modern classic i loved it
","Amazing costumes, amazing actors, great music all in all a great movie. a top notch cast of my favorite actors headline this fact based tale of con scheme. a man and woman con artist team have made good money scamming desperate people, all is well for them, until... A wild, unhinged cop named Richie(played superbly by Bradley Cooper) brings them down. Now he has a deal help him bring down some people or they both go to jail.. Soon they work with him and nothing is as it seems. the trap is set and anything can happen. Amy Adams and Christian Bale(unrecognizable and 40 pounds heavier)do a great job as the con artists Irving and Sidney. Jeremy Renner is superb as Mayor Carmine Polito who gets involved with the con artist's alluring scheme. But its Jennifer Lawrence who steals the show as Irving's crazed, manipulative wife, Rosalyn. One of the best films of 2013 and a new classic in 70's style cinema.",10,1,4,24 March 2014
The Exorcist," this is without a doubt the scariest movie ever made
","amazing. its a good plot and a great cast. Linda Blair gave a good strong performance as a young girl who starts to have some nerve problems.... but after a while it starts to get much worse. It starts some odd normal preteen behavior then some sick profound language and an unforgettable scenes: the infamous masturbation crucifix scenes. which is still the most shocking piece of footage in cinematic history. Ellen Burstlyn gives a fantastic performance as the mother of the daughter in unspeakable jeopardy. a good story of god vs Satan. a story of a 12-year-old girl possessed by an demonic force. the language, the masochistic voice, the amazing strength. and the amazing makeup make her extremely sadistic. . the mother first goes to doctors for a medical explanation, then to shrinks for a psychological explanation, then after Regen spins her head and does sick things she goes to 'witch doctors' to drive out the evil spirit. Let's not forget the famous green slime puke scenes.",10,1,3,13 February 2006

Grindhouse," spectacular double feature
","A masterpiece. from the 2 of the smartest filmmakers: Tarrantino and Rodguiez. they do a fantastic job of bringing back exploitation films of the 70's and 80's. once it starts with the outrageous over the top 'Machete' trailer you know you are in for a ride. its 2 movies for the price of one,and there is hilarious fake trailers and old commericals in between. The first film is Rodguiez's 'Planet Terror', a crazy gore fest zombie movie. It is hilarious and is so so so over the top with Rose Mcgowan as a go go dancer whose leg is chewed off by zombies, so she becomes a fighting machine, and attaches a machine gun to her leg, a crazy sight to see. Tarrantino makes an appearance as a rapist guard who turns into a zombie. After that there is two hilarious trailers: Eli Roth's bloody holiday horror 'Thanksgiving', and Rob Zombie's 'Werewolf Women of the S.S'. Then its Tarrantino's film,'death proof', an action packed car chase movie. It starts out slow,then leads to a jaw dropping car wreck sequence. Kurt Russel stars a murderer who kills off hot teens with his car. It features one of the most crazy,unbelievable, best car chases ever in a movie. the end is so entertaining it'll make you cheer. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS ITS A WILD RIDE THAT HOLDS NO BARS. BUT THERE IS SOME MISSING REELS. SO FAR THE BEST MOVIE OF 2007!",10,0,0,27 May 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," Kidman. Cruise. Kubbrick. A surprisingly good match.
","Kubbrick's final film is a ton of things, it is a dreamy sexual journey, a suspenser, and a drama. It is truly unforgettable,and refuses to leave your head. The acting is incredible, the scenes with Kidman and Cruise are priceless. The moments of fear and surprise are hard to forget. Its really a film about secrets and mysterious things. Characters do things that are unexpected, and ultimately, they pay for it. It shows how one mistake can lead to an even bigger mistake. The twists are well crafted and the dialouge is highly impressive. Masterful directing, rich colors, and a great score. Both actors prove just how much they can become their characters. And the ending hits you and you'll like 'wow'! this is a new masterpiece. artsy and risqué. I wouldn't call it Kubbrick's best or worst, but something to be cherished and acknowledged for its originality. A film that ever couple should see or someone that wants to cheat.",10,2,4,19 May 2008

Psycho," Hitchcock invents a new genre
","this is a roller-coaster ride of a scary movie. you could tell when you first hear that scary music, that something terrifying was on the way. The first half hour of the movie was kinda like a crime movie. It showed Janet Leigh stealing 40,000 dollars from her boss. then she drives far away to Touson,Arizona to find her sister. But she gets tired, so she pulls the car over and rests. In the morning she is woken up by a cop, she tries to flee. but he asks for her ID. then she goes to a car dealership, to get a new car, 'cause the same cop from before is following her. she gets a new car very quickly,and is acting very suspisicous. then she buys the car,in cash. she continues driving, but it's raining bad, she put the wipers on. but she can't at all. then she sees the big bright 'Bate's motel' sign, and pulls over. then she checks in and the motel manager,Norman Bates, a very lonely mama's boy. he seems like a nice person, she checks in under a fake name. then Norman goes to his creepy-ass house on a hill with steps right next to the motel, to get Marion some food. Marion goes into her room and hears from the house, Norman and his mom arguing. then Norman comes down the hill with the food. then him and Marion have a talk, and he says his mom is bed-ridden. after their talk, Marion goes back to her cabin. moments later, she takes a shower, which turns out to be the most shooking and most effective scence in film. Marion gets stabbed and killed by Norman who's dressed up as his mom. Hitchcock does it so brilliantly and dosen't show a single stab, also the movie's black and white so he used chocolate that goes down the drain just like blood. Another terrifying and clever scence is when a detective goes to the Bate's house to question the mom about Marion. as he goes up the stairs, a door opens a crack, then out of nowhere comes Norman, who stabs the detective, he falls down the stairs and the camera falls with him. how you find out Bate's is the killer, is Marion's sister and Marion's boyfriend go to the motel, they never heard from the detective. they pose as a couple, and Marion's sister goes up to the house,while Marion's boyfriend questions Bates, she finds Mrs. Bates, who turns out to be dead in a chair,she screams,and up pops Norman dressed as his mother and talking in his mom's voice. he has a split personality. one of the scariest and most original films of all time. it also opened up the doors to a new horror genre,slasher. very effective!",10,0,1,17 February 2006
