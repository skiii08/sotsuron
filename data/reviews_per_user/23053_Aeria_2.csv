Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great special effects and setup for story
","Phantom Menace is the perfect setup for the story we know is coming in chapters four through six. All the cues are there, from the hints in the dialogue to the camera angles used to the music score. It's all there.Also, the special effects are stunning, as expected. Lucas uses the computer animations to deliver humor, and not just from Jar Jar. Also, Lucas replaced his Kill-A-Plenty stormtroopers with robots that have about as much armor and life span as the original white-armored vict...errr, extras. His planets are gorgeous, esp. his representation of the capital planet.The one thing that many people may not like about Phantom Menace is that it lacks the sense of urgency and overwhelming fear that Star Wars had in such abundance. One of the reasons I think people feel this way is a lack of a definite 'bad guy'. There's Darth Sithious, and Darth Maul, and the Trade Federation, but none of them act as a central 'bad guy'--instead, they share the role, and none of them get effective treatment. Also, the fight scene with Darth Maul lacked conviction. Maul was much more a 'hammer'--something just to deliver a blow rather than to really be a fully developed 'bad guy'. The whole ending seemed to be a bit lightweight, as if people are waiting for something to happen(as we know it will, since this is a prequel).I don't think it was worth camping out for(and I didn't), but it was worth the hour and a half wait in line for decent seats.",9,0,0,19 May 1999
The Mummy," George of the Jungle parodies mummy movies
","They were trying to make a parody, right? The Mummy ends up parodying every monster movie ever made. The pacing, the dialogue, everything...very predictable. The dialogue and action sets us up, and then follows through with no surprises whatsoever. Nothing was scary; nothing was surprising. Everything from the bugs to the 'don't read the book!' to the Americans and the Egyptologist getting it, to the end fight scenes and the sinking of the city...all set up...ugh! Why didn't they just send a telegraph instead...oh, wait, they did. I was more entertained by counting how many different plot points they gave away before they happened than the movie itself. The mummies weren't scary at all. They looked more like actors dressed up in rags doing the moonwalk. Also, when the whole audience breaks out in laughter when a poor extra gets vacuumed by the scarabs, then there's a severe problem.The special effects and sets are great. The acting was acceptable, if you can stand George of the Jungle in Egypt. Fraiser made the movie comical, but I think the director, other actors, scriptwriter, etc. didn't realize how comical they were really being. If there had been an attempt to make this a parody, instead of an 'action/horror' flick, it would have been much better.So, if you have no intelligence and enjoy being beat over the back of the head with a board labeled 'PLOT', then go see the Mummy. As for me, I'm going to go find the bottle named Alieve. Maybe it'll soothe my aching head.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
