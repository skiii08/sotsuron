The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Suzanne Collins is one of the most famous fortunate authors in the world.
","She has some of the best adaptation of books ever written. The movies add to the books, since those are only seen from Katniss' point of view.Everything was impressive: the setting, the acting... and the soundtrack. The music gives great emotion to certain scenes. The 'hanging tree' song scenes are thrilling.I suppose enough has been written.About the people who found this boring? They should have a look at 'Speed' or 'Demolition man', those are movies they will like better. This one had character development and acting.I specially love how they showed Plutarch's influence on Alma Coin... they didn't tell, they showed it. All in all, impressive. Even if not much happened, I had a wonderful time in the cinema, the two hours passed in a flash, I was thrilled and moved at certain points (the soundtrack is really powerful), and I went yearning for more. Luckily, I still have the books.This series will be for its generation what Star Wars (first trilogy, back in the seventies and eighties) was for the previous one.",10,3,22,9 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Way to ruin the mystery, the mystique and the nostalgia.
","If this movie was an isolated, one-shot adventure movie, it would get a 5. Maybe a 6 at the time, because the effects were particularly beautiful, but that doesn't last. But it's part of the Star Wars saga, the best adventure saga in all time. And the harm it does to the saga must be taken into account, so it gets a 4.The good: Darth Maul. They got an actor who could really fence, and in one of the scenes he jumps off a bike and is slashing before he even touches the floor. Best thing in the movie, and possibly one of the best things in the prequels.The average: The effects are so good! OK, the effects are good. Nowadays that doesn't impress anyone. They were pretty impressive in 1999, but still, effects give nothing new now. If the action scenes are badly filmed, CGI cannot save them.The bad: everything else. I, for starters, was bored. Maybe it wasn't boring for children, but I came from the original Star Wars saga. I was used to action with a reason to care. I wasn't the least interested in these characters. The action wasn't very well done. That pod race had nothing against Return of the Jedi imperial bike races.The terrible: OK... if a spiritual force is turned biological, that's a way to destroy the mystique. Measuring power in points is DragonBall, NOT Star Wars. The acting was wooden at best, very bad in some cases. Jar Jar Binks. I won't even get into this one. Immaculate birth of Anakin Skywalker? His mother is a slave, couldn't he have a dead father or enslaved father somewhere? This one was ridiculous.The one that I hate but may be personal: Prophecy? Chosen one? This had been used to exhaustion in 1999, and now it's even older. I like characters having something special, and them working their way into the top. But I don't like them having their destiny set in stone. I particularly loath the idea of the chosen one. It's just bad writing.I just hope Disney remakes the prequels as soon as they can. Meanwhile, I will try to erase them from my brain. As far as I know, they do not exist.",4,1,9,19 December 2015
Troy," Totally underrated by ignorant people and critics.
","Sorry if the title sounds offensive, but that's how it is. This movie was blasted because some ignorant people and VERY ignorant critics decided it wasn't 'faithful enough' to the Iliad. I didn't see anyone complaining about how Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy deviates from Tolkien's work. Talk about double standards.Quick and to the point: The city of Troy existed historically and was destroyed. The only account we have of one of the times Troy was destroyed (because it was destroyed a dozen times), is Homer's Iliad. So the filmmakers used it as a source material, yes. And then, they tried to make the story real, they tried to make a version of how things would have happened without Zeus, Hera or Apollo waltzing around the scene. They tried to make the story both realistic and epic. And you know what? They did an immensely impressive job at it.Once the direct intervention of gods is out, they pretty much respected Homer's telling. Let's have a look at Homer's character development there:1. Achilles the cocky show-off extraordinaire. Check. 2. Achilles in love with his Patroclus. Uncheck, it's Hollywood, not possible. 3. Achilles in lust with slave girl Briseis. Check. 4. Paris a wimp. Check. 5. Agamemnon proud, ambitious and dictatorial. Check. 6. Priam stupid, overconfident or unwilling to see what's coming. Check. 7. Hector the most courageous, noble, character. Faithful husband, loving father (Homer described him that way). Whoa, check. Special mention to Sean Bean's impressive acting. 8. Andromacha, Hector's wife, model of loyal wife and mother (yep, Homer also portrays her that way). Check. 9. Ajax a brute force fighter. Check.I don't think it makes much sense to go on with this. I just find it ridiculous that many people who either haven't read Homer, or just have read the Cliff's Notes for the Iliad, are attacking the movie on its supposed inaccuracy. The inaccuracies are extremely few, and the huge ones were obviously done PURPOSEFULLY. The filmmakers wanted a version of the War of Troy as it could have happened in reality, without gods directly meddling in the action. But the character depth and development, greatly respects Homer's writing and style. Even in the play-down of homosexual themes and the better treatment of female characters, since that's what Homer does in his works. He treats women far better than most Greeks used to do, and doesn't focus much on homosexual themes (though they are there... however, I guess you can't ask Hollywood to put that into a super-production, much less with Brad Pitt on it).The photography, settings and film-making are impressive. The action scenes are great, with the plus of them not being blurred. You can actually see what's happening, something rare in action scenes of late.I must add the lightning and photography are extremely beautiful. The soundtrack is more than impressive. Some of the dialog is amazing.The acting is good when given to good actors. Menelaus, Agamemnon, Ajax, Priam, Ulises, Andromacha, and above all, Hector and Priam, fill the screen when they speak.Brad Pitt looks great when he fights. He looks ridiculous when he tries to act. At least, when he tries to act seriously and tragically. He plays the pimp-esquire guy pretty believable. It's when he tries to get serious that you don't believe him.Orlando Bloom makes an Ã¼ber-wimp Paris. But then Paris should be a coward wimp, that's what he was in the myth too.Helen is very beautiful, but she seems to have Schweppes tonic in her veins instead of blood. Her character was indeed changed from what it is in the book. In the Iliad, Helen is a tragic figure, forced to desire Paris because goddess Aphrodite gave her (yes, gave her as an object) to Paris. When Paris starts behaving as the coward, irresponsible wimp he is, Helen despises her. In the book, of course. If you get Aphrodite's orders out of the question (as happens in the movie), Helen is a blond airhead with no interest at all, just as wimpy and ridiculous as Paris. But then again, without Aphrodite's meddling, there was no way to make Helen the tragic figure she is in the book. Helen's flee with Paris is more understandable by watching Menelaus.I don't think the movie deserves a 10, I would have given it just a nine for entertainment, epic, good acting and beautiful imagery. But considering its score is artificially lowered by totally unfair reviews, I've upped my score to a 10, just to compensate.This movie has been treated unfairly by both critics and reviewers. It deserved and deserves better.",10,2,5,10 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst in the prequels, which is hard to beat.
","OK, if the prequels were not Star Wars related, I would give them a 5-3-4. This one would have a 3 for the CGI. But the dialogue is ridiculous, cheesy and corny, the actors cannot do anything with it. There's Jar Jar. As the movies belong to the Star Wars universe, and actually contradict the original saga, detracting from its greatness. The Clone Wars were a mystery... if you destroy a mysterious past, you'd better replace the intrigue with something better. To get these answers, I'd rather have the questions. Bobba Fett calling his daddy? Thank God I didn't see this in the cinema. I would have demanded a refund and the complaints book.I don't think Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are bad actors. They are not great, but not bad. The script and the love story they were given was IMPOSSIBLE to act correctly. I really hope those two recover from this. I am not going to say this love story is the worst ever, because that infamy is well-deserved by Twilight. However, I would gladly put it in second place.I think the movie is a 3. Not even the spectacular scenes compensate for the bad acting, the bad plot and the boredom. And nothing compensates for the destruction of the previous movies lore. In the Star Wars saga, it should get a 2 (only because the 1 must be reserved for stuff like Dragonball Evolution). Normally I give the stars I think the movie deserves regardless of how other people are voting. But I think it's an insult to the collective intelligence of mankind that this movie has anything over a 5. So it's getting one star. I will now proceed to re-erase it from my brain, and beg Disney to remake the prequels. With a good writer.",1,3,15,19 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I can't believe this has a 7,7 total score!
","I had been avoiding watching this for years. After Attack of the Clones, I was so angry I didn't want ANYTHING to do with Star Wars, ever again.But people told me 'oh, you missed on the best' 'It's the best in the prequels', 'It's not that bad'. Most people said this one is the best among the prequels. Some people said this one is the best so far in the whole saga. I took that last one with a grain of salt, but still that raised my expectations a bit.I was watching the first space battle thinking. 'OK, this is cool, I see why some people were genuinely impressed'. I even liked Obi Wan's dialogue up to 'spring the trap'. Then people started talking and acting. Or trying to act with the dialogue they had been given (and in all honestly, I feel for poor Portman and Christensen for the dialogue they had to deal with). When Portmand and Christensen are given good sentences and scenes, they actually do things right. Not on-par with the acting of the originals, but correctly. For Christensen, his chances come in the first scene with Palpatine at the theater (a bit of good acting and dialogue in the middle of the disaster), and his last scene with Obi Wan. Poor Natalie Portman has only one chance to shine, but delivers the wonderful 'This is how liberty dies'. Those moments of light show us that the actors are not that incompetent. It's just that no actor can endure the dialogue they have been given and look decent. Heck, even Sean Connery looked ridiculous in The Avengers. Great acting will only take you so far.As for Ewan McGregor, I am a bit fed up of people thinking he is a good actor. He was impressive in the film Trainspotting, as the terribly selfish sometimes sociopathic guy. Because he was impressive there, people keep hiring him, and I keep seeing the same sociopathic smile in all his roles: when he was wooing Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, and certainly here as Obi Wan. He is not a good actor. With the ridiculous dialogue he gets, it's even worse. But the worst thing is the script. The dialogue is ridiculous (specially between the supposed lovers) and cheesy beyond the bearable. The character development is null. Anakin is super powerful but destroys his life because he wants to save his wife... and then kills her... Anakin makes a mistakes (kills someone he shouldn't), and as a result, instead of apologizing, goes and kill a full kindergarten. No stupider main character ever disgraced the screen.If you like flashy lights, you can watch the first five minutes. I enjoyed those. You might find Padme's only good line (This is how liberty ends) in youtube. You will see Hayden's best moment ('You underestimate my power') in internet memes. And the Anakin-Palpatine scene, I admit, was nice to watch.The rest you can throw away. Specially the supposed romance. The poor kids (Natalie and Hayden) have to deal with the worst-written romance lines ever. Well, maybe those were the ones in Twilight, but I can't be sure.'Oh, Anakin' 'I can go to Naboo and prepare the baby's room' (I almost puked at listening to this one). 'You are breaking my heart'. Seriously? OK, I admit the movie does not deserve a 1. That should go for the likes of Dragonball Evolution. As a standalone film, I would give it a four. As a part of Star Wars, considering incoherences with the previous movies and everything it breaks, it should have a 3. However, the vast amount of people who gave this a ten just flabbergasted me. The rating is way too artificially inflated. If the movie in general had a five or a six, I would give it its proper rating (3). But, 7,7 as of December 2015? No way. Someone may actually believe it and no, really. I will keep on praying for Disney to remake the prequels. There is so much material for improvement here.",1,3,19,19 December 2015
