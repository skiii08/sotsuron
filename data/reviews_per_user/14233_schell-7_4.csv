Vertigo," 'Citizen Kane's main rival
","'Vertigo' is Hitchcock's most resonant, inexhaustible, resonant film. The plot is no more relevant that the libretto of the best opera. It's the combined 'music' created by the cinematography, directing, acting, and Bernard Hermann's score that makes 'Vertigo' the screen's equivalent of Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde.' There's no more spinte-tingling moment in all of cinema than Judy's transformation into Madeleine as seen through the eyes of the screen's most talented, versatile, intense, believable actor, James Stewart . No moment affirms the power of eat cinema to exert a suspension of disbelief rivaling, as Coleridge would maintain, the Almighty Creator's.",Null,2,3,25 February 2016
No Country for Old Men," A Giant Leap from 'Fargo' to Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus
","The title comes from the opening line of W. B. Yeats' famous poem 'Sailing to Byzantium,' in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland ('no country for old men') for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium. But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence. This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions. On the other hand, it's not a story for those those film-goers who insist on a traditional 'movie bad guy' and simply cannot, or refuse to, see the universal and very personal meanings represented by the characters, all of whom--from Barden's unstoppable killer to Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff--mirror our deepest desires, fears, and insecurities. Although not a movie serving up the escape and closure expected by traditional theater audiences, it nevertheless has the power to grip and engage the viewer like few other films. And like a Flannery O'Connor short story, its dark humor and violence ultimately lodge in personal consciousness (I frankly was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end, before leaving the theater 'sadder but wiser' for the experience).The story is the Coen brothers' 'bait' to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters. After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with 'self-consciousness'-- with the capacity to think about our individual 'identities,' and even about our own life and death. The key to putting together all that the spectator has experienced comes with the appearance of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff in the final scene of the movie. He says that he's quitting as sheriff. He had expected 'God to somehow come into his life' but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched. The film's nemesis is a merciless 'executioner' with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of 'morality') inadequate. We, like the sheriff, are now faced with the inescapability of our own mortality and with re-visioning our past life in light of this disturbing reality.Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic 'hero.' he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in 'Nam'--but that won't cut it in the relentless, fatalistic, chancy determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives. Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother and he can be distracted by a female sunbather.Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly. She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice. Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, representing mortality more accurately: 'It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me. It's you.' But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: 'You're wrong. That's how I got here.' It's a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. But its through Bardem's mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God. When will we learn? Why can't we?And therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's 'fatal flaw' and along with it a small ray of light. Human agency has a role after all. Brolin did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else. And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat. Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother- in-law, selfishly assuming that the Executioner was interested 'only' in him. The last two scenes practically 'require' interpretation. The Executioner (vulnerable himself, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away. Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act. The recovered Executioner now ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet'). What's next on his agenda? The viewer can only speculate, even as the film cuts to Jones' sheriff relating a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: 'I woke up.'That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on. It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever. There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them. It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us. We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that 'good' isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it. And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery. And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will when we're older.Finally, the film's setting must be taken seriously. It repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered. Everyone wants answers. We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them.",10,4,6,30 April 2012
The Departed," DiCaprio finally comes of age under a worthy father.
","I've seen the film only once, which is not quite enough to catch some crucial details about the father at the beginning. But the film is essentially a frantic gangster send-up like 'Goodfellas' plus Hamlet with a theological twist: it's the search for identity and for the father, which are essentially the same thing. It's also a film in which DiCaprio is no longer seen as a mere teenager or, recalling Spielberg's leaden caper film, where Sheen is more caricature than believable character. There's a scene in the film between DiCaprio and Nicholson during which I was conscious for the first time that the former could hold his own--as a mature, believable, adult actor--and with the very best of them. And what a crucial scene that turns out to be. In this modern-day 'Hamlet' tale about a young man's desperate search for identity, he gains it--threefold-- and just at the moment we're convinced he's lost everything. In the film's last incredibly tense, head-spinning moments, we learn that 1. DiCaprio rather than Matt Damon is the trusted 'son' of the mafia father figure played by Nicholson (Damon's character rejects outright the sentimental notion of being a 'son' to Nicholson); 2. we are assured that DiCapio's identity is not lost when Mark Wahlberg's character, as a surrogate for Martin Sheen's character which, in turn, is a surrogate father to DiCaprio's, shows up to dispose of the impostor; 3.finally, the deal is triply 'clinched' at our realization that the father of the baby being borne by Madolyn is not Damon's but DiCaprio's. The line from 'Hamlet' that's recited is 'Readiness is all.' But life, Scorsese, seems to be saying, is far more unpredictable and ludicrous, far more messy than this: none of us is ever ready (Nicholson's line to the effect that 'we're all dying' suggests as much), and DiCaprio's character seems the least ready of all. Yet in the midst of all the violence and bloodshed, and despite all the lunacy and confusion, justice and clarity win out after all. This is, in many respects, the film befitting a mature, or 'senior,' director, who is moreover a man of faith. Unlike Coppola's fascination with the 'humanness' of mafia families, Scorsese seems more interested in the 'humanity' of these unsaintly, fallen prodigals who come to symbolize us all: they represent the universal human condition in all its absurdity and hope for redemption. For Scorsese they, no less than all of us, must not be consigned outright to the circle of the eternally damned. Even in their twisted, misguided, and confused relations, fathers and sons manage to find one another, mothers produce the sons by the fathers they truly love, the identity that is at once so elusive and questionable emerges after all--there's no question about its being a human identity and there's even a possibility that it retains much that is holy, emanating from a supreme father who ultimately pilots this ship of violent fools to a peaceful end.",10,0,2,25 May 2009
There Will Be Blood," Renews hope that film can hold its own with a great Faulkner novel.
","The acting, the settings, the cinematography, the uncompromising editing (rejecting the familiar shot/reverse shot relay in favor of long takes), the spectacular scene of a fiery oil strike (recalling the air strike in 'Apocalypse Now'), the nuanced richness of the film score, the Olympian performance of Day-Lewis (perhaps only Orson Welles' Kane compares) require that anyone who is the least bit serious about film make this experience a top priority.But the end of this disturbing spectacle doesn't produce the catharsis of either a 'Citizen Kane' (whose protagonist has at least an intimation of the truth, i.e. Rosebud) or an 'Oedipus Rex' (whose protagonist not only eventually acquires self-knowledge but acts on it), and for that reason I'm withholding a star. Films that are ultimately the most powerful and enduring are those that put the verisimilitude of 'everyday life' first and foremost, leaving the deeper allegorical implications to those who choose to pursue them.At the half-way point, the film takes a surrealistic turn, and more than likely many spectators who have begun this lengthy film (with Lewis dominating every shot and scene save one) will tune out. It's even more likely that most casual spectators will, at the end of this seemingly out-of-control scenario, simply breathe a sigh of relief that it's over and dismiss the whole business as wild and wacky, crazy stuff.But now that I've seen the film, it's become rooted in consciousness much like a Faulkner novel, in which a single character (named Compson or Sutpen) comes to represent an entire culture, from its idealistic, heroic and noble beginnings to its delusional and narcissistic, pathetic and decadent end (Faulkner's thunderous 'Absalom! Absalom!' is the modern prototype). You will see no blood in this film. That would require a character capable of forgiving and being forgiven, of loving and being loved, of being not merely the sole god of his universe (who abandons his son, after denying that he's even begotten him) but the lamb, willing to sacrifice himself for others and able to function as a member of a human family whose bonds are not merely the artificial ones based on greed, radical individualism, and unrelenting competitiveness. Instead, we are left with the certainty that the ambition and arrogance we have witnessed can only beget more needless destruction of human life. In that sense, there indeed will be blood.Yes, the movie is especially relevant to our present political-economic situation (toward the end of the film a character makes reference to a bad 'economy'--and the year is 1927, 2 years before 1929--or, if you prefer, 2009). But it hits even deeper and closer to home than the culture surrounding us. It doesn't require a lot of soul-searching to see the protagonist as a symbol, or magnified reflection, of one's own selfish journey in life. The discovery is more than a little disturbing, exposing the wounds of ethnic pride, family insularity and, above all, the constant denial and prideful isolation practiced by the willful self. Nonetheless, the film ultimately fails to achieve the delicate balance between 'pity and fear' that Aristotle required of great tragedy. Daniel Day-Lewis's character is obviously fatally flawed if not hubris personified (the other part of the Aristotelian definition), and that's a pity of immense proportions--but no more.Later: This is a film that continues to play out long after the final scene. If there's a hint of redemptive blood in the story, it's not in the protagonist but his son. The early shots of him as a baby are sufficient proof to this viewer that Daniel Plainview is (despite his final disclaimer that he took the child merely to promote sales) the boy's father and that the son is not a mere innocent claimed by the father as a sales gimmick. The spectator's 'reward' occurs when, for a fractional moment at the end, we see the 'deaf-mute' son respond to his father's voice. That moment tells us that the son has deliberately chosen an indirect, defensive route of communicating with a non-communicative father, wisely (as it turns out) hedging his bets should the father prove adamant and unyielding in his bloodless inhumanity. The son, not the father, has seen to the completion of the 'Abraham-Isaac' story, an archetypal drama that offers hope for a future in which the son, rather than repeat the sins of the father, acquires an identity of his own.",9,2,3,23 March 2009
