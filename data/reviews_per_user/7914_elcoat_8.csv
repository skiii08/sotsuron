Blade Runner 2049," Depressing with too many questionable questions.
","More than one person has wondered why this has such a high rating. I suspect it is ballot box stuffing by the studio's friends ... or bots ... which I have seen for other recent, poor movies.Didn't Rachael and Deckard head up to Alaska at the conclusion of the original? What were they doing back in Los Angeles? Why would they have wanted to return??At the end, how was Joe able to take Deckard to his daughter without Wallace stopping them?Much cruelty and blood-letting.I liked Olmos being in the film, so I'm upping it to a 2.But it is a very depressing film showing a future from - in - Hell.And I think there will be many more real humans left alive in 2049. 1984 wasn't in 1984, although we seem to be sliding into it now.",2,4,8,26 June 2019
The 13th Warrior," GREAT Northern European ethnic history film ... and no comedy.
","This is a screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's fictional melding of the legend of Beowulf and the journal of the Arab visitor to earliest Viking Age Scandinavia, Ahmad ibn Fadlān ibn al-Abbās ibn Rāid ibn Hammād.Antonio Banderas did an excellent job as the lead character, ibn Fadlan/'eben.' The explanation of Grendel and his mother ... who looked like a teenage actress, actually ... is more plausible than ... but not as good as ... the legend. The depiction of the Vikings' lifestyle remains true to idb Fadlan's writings. The sense of honor and humor shows a noble people living in and dealing with a harsh, primitive environment and the resulting society.The depiction of Beowulf is powerful and complimentary. He doesn't say much, but every word has impact.The sympathetic treatment of Islam is intriguing. Scandinavia is right now trying to reconcile Muslim immigrants with indigenous Christians and nonbelievers in religion. The outcome of this is ... problematic, as the 2011 terrorist attack by one disaffected young Norwegian male here in Norway evidenced.Every young (or old) person of the Northern European heritage should see ... and consider ... this film.",10,1,2,7 January 2016
Gettysburg," A moving and very educational - truly great - docudrama of a key American battle..
","I too have watched this over and over. Criticisms of the fake beards and other flaws miss the overall meaning and majesty of this film.If I was a teacher of American history ... or of English in another country ... and wanted a film for my students to see which would epitomize *American* beliefs and resolution, this would be it. As at least one other reviewer has pointed out, Jeff Daniels' monologue about the North's case for war is deeply moving and explains why and how antislavery was the basic issue at stake.If the film is too long for the classroom, that monologue, Buford's cavalry's desperate holding action at the outset of the battle, the pre-battle conversation between Longstreet and the British Army observer Freemantle, the fight for Little Round Top, and Pickett's Charge are the excerpts that most should be shown.A personal anecdote: An old Army buddy of mine, who had to put up with my love for military history even while we were draftees, lives in Bethel PA. My then 13 yr old son and I were visiting the Naval Academy, THE Academy (West Point), and swinging back through PA to go home to Illinois. Ron was eager to show off Gettysburg to me, even though my primary interest has been World War 2. We got to the top of one of the Gettysburg observation towers - since torn down - and even before he could start his local history lecture, my son started exclaiming 'Hey! There's Seminary Ridge! There's Cemetery Ridge! There are the Round Tops!' etc. etc.You see, Robert and I had played the Gettysburg board game - Cemetery Hill - in the old Simulations Publications Inc. Blue & Gray 'quad' game set, and we had fought back and forth over the terrain ourselves, being motivated to learning the true history of the battle from the set's historical commentary and other sources. :-) Ted Turner did a profound service to our Country, seeing this film through to completion, and he has my deepest thanks. Every American should see this film! Lou Coatney, Librarian, Historian, Historical Game and (cardstock paper) Model Ship Designer",10,0,1,27 October 2011
We Were Soldiers," WWS's American Historical Review reviewer strongly recommends it.
","I wrote the February 2003 review of this film for the scholarly/professional review journal American History Review (when they were still reviewing films).While drafting my review, I interviewed by telephone both General Moore and Joe Galloway, and I called them back to ask them to read them my final draft and ask them to correct any factual errors. They did not attempt to change my opinions of the film, and I wouldn't have let them.(I should add that Joe Galloway has a very moving interview the Americans At War series put on YouTube, and he mentions Pvt. Jimmy Nakayama.)For copyright reasons, I can't reprint here the last paragraph of my AHR review, but I can say that I said and believe that EVERY ADULT American SHOULD SEE THIS FILM, before joining the military or ever sending our young people off to war.It should also be noted for historical accuracy that Mrs. (Julia) Moore did not actually deliver the death telegrams herself - a powerful dramatic device in the film, to be sure - but when she found out they had indeed been delivered by cab drivers, she personally visited and consoled every family she could locate. As Madeleine Stowe so well portrays her in the film, she is a great lady.Even though the film premiered at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, it is hardly a recruiting film as some here have claimed. It is traumatically honest about the horror of war and its human cost (especially to the military community).It should have received a bevy of Oscars - which would have been on the eve of our invasion of Iraq - and if it had, I think more Americans would have questioned that war and our leaders' determination to start it.The Army fully supported the filming, and there was a memorial service in the Ft. Benning chapel before filming during which the veterans - especially Ernie Savage, I've been told - expressed their desire to all the members of the film company that the film be truthful, that they 'get it right.' And they did.The Pentagon may have since questioned itself for supporting the film: it is as anti-war as it is pro-military.WWS is equal to the other great war films Battleground (about GIs in the Battle of the Bulge) and Attack! (starring Jack Palance and real-life war hero Eddie Albert playing his demoralized, cowardly commander), and it far surpasses the likes of Saving Private Ryan.Lou Coatney",10,3,5,21 April 2010
The Alamo," Excellent, dramatic historical film slandered by ignorant critics.
","This is the most accurate film about the Alamo massacre that I have seen. And it takes the time to bring out the very human personalities of the historical figures involved.
The savagery of those times and battles is clear and hard to dismiss. It was good to see the U.S. Army Regulars Andy-by-God-Jackson had sent down, in the film.
As the Texican Army retreats, the viewer *feels* the frustration and growing anger of its men, as Houston - fully played by Dennis Quaid - waits ... and waits. If that quote of him about Wellington is true, he had certainly learned from him.
(My GGG Grandfather Charles Jack was a 17 year old Scots British Army officer cadet in Belgium in 1815 - later he joined The British Legion in Bolivar's War of Independence in Venezuela.)
Patrick Wilson is a perfect Travis, as he would be a perfect Lt. Cdr Layton in the new Midway film. Great intensity.
And Jason Patric's Bowie is similarly vivid, unforgettable.
But of course Billy Bob Thornton's *David* Crockett is the film's showpiece.
Every American - not just Texan - should see this film and learn from it.",10,0,0,28 February 2020
Heartbreak Ridge," A superb representation of the time and the event
","In October 1983, after I had heard that the Marxist prime minister of Grenada had been murdered in a pro-Soviet coup, over my lunch hour I literally ran down from the Alaska State Office Building in Juneau (wherein I worked in the Alaska State Library) to the Alaska Federal Building and breathlessly burst into the Congressional offices. To my friends there, I hoarsed out that the government of Grenada was now illegitimate, that it was open season for anyone to liberate Grenada, and to get on the phone to Sen. Ted Stevens' foreign affairs staffer and ask him to tell Ted that we could turn the Cold War completely around if we acted militarily FAST.I am sure it wasn't just me thinking this. In any case, staffers reputedly brought the decision to act militarily to President Reagan on the golf course, and after a few moments ... in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt ... he said YES, and Operation 'Urgent Fury' was launched. (Granted, Maggie Thatcher's Commonwealth feathers were ruffled and *she* was furious, but President Reagan brought her around with his great Irish charm.) And our liberation of Grenada was indeed the boots on the ground military turning point of the Cold War, leading to our - and everyone's - Cold War victory *without* a World War 3.What people have forgotten is that just before, our Marine barracks in Beirut Lebanon had been suicide-bombed and in that post-Vietnam era, our national morale was rock-bottom. On 1Sep83, there had also been the Red Air Force's ... unanswered ... massacre of Korean Air Lines flight 007, which had flown over Sakhalin Island - maybe unintentionally, maybe not, but nonetheless ....Seldom have a nation's feelings ... and actions ... transformed so quickly as ours did with our Grenada operation.Clint Eastwood's depiction of the Marine Corps and that military operation may be in some ways flawed, but nonetheless is an excellent depiction of all this and the of Marine Corps community's ready response.For veterans like myself - Army draftee, Stateside and West Germany, 67-69 - it can be enjoyably funny. It was the first time I had ever heard the phrase 'cluster f**k.' We might keep in mind, though, how we reacted when Russia threatened our inner national security zone, when we criticize Russia's reaction to our own machinations within *its* inner national security zone today in Ukraine. If we don't, we could escalate this situation into nuclear holocaust overnight.Lou Coatney",10,0,1,12 August 2014
Cars," A great and brilliant movie - possibly dangerous for toddlers.
","I heard about my Norwegian nephew becoming addicted to this film when he was 2, and I was concerned when my wife bought it for our 2 yr old son to watch.My concern was justified: He is literally mesmerized by it and would watch it continually/obsessively, if we would let him.I'm sure HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey would approve. It humanizes machines.And I must concede that there is plenty in the film for adults to realize and enjoy - lots of humorous and insightful references to past times that the kids miss. I pick up new humorous details, every time I hear it ... again. And I felt moved to learn that Hudson Hornet Doc's voice was that of Paul Newman.The music is great, the action terrific to the point that you forget it's animated, and the moral of the story - not unlike Doc Hollywood: that there are more important things in life than just 'winning' (lots of money and/or fame) - is important for children to learn early in life. All except teen ages should enjoy it immensely.It is a timeless film.However, I do not recommend letting very young children watch it.",10,1,2,11 June 2010
Meet Joe Black," Joe Black dropped by to say hello, today.
","As usually happens with cardiac moments I have learned it was just after I got up, as it had been for my first real heart attack 3 years ago.(When that happened, I went and lay down on my back in bed and then - on the spur of the moment - on the brink of the abyss - reasoned that raising and laying my left arm up above me on the bed might straighten out the heart artery and let the blood flow again, which it apparently did, with the help of an aspirin. A half hour later a second attack came, I did the same thing, it subsided, and I fell asleep - happily to awaken.
I almost forgot to tell me doctor about these, and when I did he became alarmed, tests verified the attacks, and - at no expense in Norway's wonderful national health care - I had an angiogram: a little pipe inserted in the artery.
I had stopped my heart medicine for about a month, ergo this recent little episode this morning, apparently. And I have now just gotten back from one of my long but careful heart walks.)In any case, my first thought this morning - again confronted with the possibility of dying and deserting my children - was this movie, which I had seen some years ago, long before the attacks.It is very gradual - slow - and gentle and gentlemanly, as Hopkins&Pitt movies are, and its subject is one of the most basic to living creatures.And it has an appropriately beautiful ending. HIGHLY recommended.(And yes, I have seen Andre Rieux's excellent performance of Sir Anthony's similarly beautiful composition, And the Waltz Goes On.)",10,1,1,1 February 2020
