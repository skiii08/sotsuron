It," Excellent movie
","I'll keep this one short and sweet. IT was incredible for many reasons. The acting, The cinematography, Pennywise, just to list a few. I was most impressed by the acting, specifically the group that made up the 'loser club'. These movies that center around kids or early teens, sink or swim based on their abilities. They all seemed to be perfectly cast for their roles and they knocked it out of the park. I wouldn't necessarily call this movie scary, but it is chilling at times. Also, can be touching to see what some of the children are dealing with at school or home, besides a homicidal clown. I was too young when the original came out so I cannot really compare the two movies. I know a part 2 will be coming out and I am thrilled. If you are on the fence about seeing this movie, please just go with an open mind and you will not regret it. Enjoy!!Rob",9,2,4,10 October 2017
A Star Is Born," One of the best overall movies in years.
","I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm not great at sharing how I feel, but I'll try. If you watched this movie and you weren't touched, you possibly have no soul. If you haven't made it to the theater yet, get off this website and see it ASAP. This movie has it all. I can't say it any better. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga should clean house in several award categories.",Null,0,0,10 October 2018
Green Room," Very Impressed
","My girlfriend and I saw this movie today because after a few trailers and reading a few good things about it, I was definitely interested. Needless to say, I was not let down. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Some scenes took the violence to a level I was not quite expecting, which was a good thing.Straight to the point plot, and an excellent cast really worked well together. The eerie setting of the bar, and the green room within the bar had me feeling like I was a grungy rock band myself. Without being able to say much more without any spoilers, I'll leave it at this. This movie is worth your time! Give it a chance!",7,3,9,15 May 2016
Aquaman," DC is finally getting it
","Thankfully, finally, DC comes through in a big big way. What a beautiful, well written movie. The best part? Zak Snyder is nowhere near this project. The soundtrack, cinematography, and cast worked so well together. I believe it also helped that this origin story hasn't been told that often. I was beyond impressed. I think I only caught one mention of the monstrosity that was Justice League and once this movie was tied to that universe they made the right decision and steered clear. Seeing this movie done so well, it made me wonder what could have been for the DCEU had they been smart about things and you know actually built their universe from the ground up with movies like this. Either way, it looks like things are finally looking up if they can continue to make movies like this. Give it a try! 8/10

The Last Song," Probably not a 7 but need to balance the ridiculous scores out
","Okay I'm a 34 year old male who watched this movie the other day. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I like Greg Kinnear a lot and the Hemsworth kid.
I'm not a Miley fan by any means but it's clear all of these low scores bashing this movie are in response to hating her.
It's a simple love story with teen angst and all that. It doesn't rewrite the genre by any means but it's not terrible. Has so some beautiful music and cinematography as well. Give it a watch if you're bored and keep an open mind.",7,2,2,18 July 2019
Suicide Squad," Despite its flaws, still entertains, and gives me hope for the future
","Suicide Squad will be remembered as a failure for some fans and I understand the complaints about it. The positive side of me is trying to be forgiving to the DC universe because I know they are rushed and trying to play catch up to Marvel. The negative side of me was just baffled at a few things. Spoilers ahead.-The CGI. WTF is all I can really say. I get it for the most part, it's a comic book movie, yeah yeah, but come on. The diablo effects were laughable. Most of the scenes with Enchantress and her minions were as well. Will this be the theme of all the DC movies? Are they doing this intentionally to try and have more of a comic feel? -Enchantress is the main protagonist was the best they could come up with? A weak villain does not keep the interest of casual fans. I know this movie was designed with the thought of having the Joker used for future films, but this angle with Enchantress really didn't click. And why does every villain need to design a 'machine'? A few of the positives I noticed were: +Margot Robbie was incredible and perfectly cast for this Role.+Although they had limited screen time, Batman and Joker were excellent.+Good to see some continuity within the DC universe. Small details matter, like mentioning Superman & Batman, metahumans, etc. This will pay off for DC if they keep working! Overall, it is clear DC still has plenty of work to do to please their fans. I was still pleased despite some plot holes and will continue to look forward to future movies.6/10.Rob",6,0,2,7 August 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Absolute perfection
","I hope everyone appreciates this movie for the piece of art it is. Everything that has happened in the MCU (22 movies) mattered. This movie blended all of the storylines into one arc beautifully. It has a perfect blend of drama and well timed comedic moments. Every character has a chance to shine and the cast delivered at every chance. It has a perfect ending.
Of course the Disney/marvel machine will roll on. They are printing money at this point. But let's all take a while and appreciate the work of the entire team that made this happen for fans. I grew up wondering if I'd ever see this material on a big screen. I feel like a kid watching these movies and I'll always love them for that.So please, avoid the spoilers and see this for yourself. Enjoy it now and forever.",10,3,7,28 April 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," I enjoyed, Others will complain.
","This latest installment of the X-Men franchise really surprised me. It had it all IMO. Action, drama, and some well timed comedy. The casting was well done as the story helped to transition to other (younger and cheaper) characters like Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Mcavoy killed it as Professor X again. Evan Peters as Quicksilver made the most with limited screen time. The story tied in with all other installments which is always hard to do with movies of this magnitude. Some negatives for me: Apocalypse. Not sure why he can touch a TV and learn the entire history of mankind. The Magneto, I see good in you, you're not evil, story line is tired and if he just had a hand in killing that many people I doubt he would be forgiven so easily. I can overlook some plot holes and nonsense as long as the rest of the movie is enjoyable, which it was. I'd see this movie again and look forward to future X-Men movies.",7,6,13,28 May 2016
Logan," This is an excellent movie in every way
","To start, let me just get to the point, Logan is incredible. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart put all they had into this movie, and it was obvious. They will forever be pictured when people think about a live action Wolverine or Professor X. They were perfectly cast for these roles, and they have made them their own. Youngster Dafne Keen (Laura) impressed me more than I thought she would. She made me believe all her emotions and I cannot imagine anyone else performing that role any better. This movie was a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. It makes you angry and sad and you will also laugh quite a bit. It is very violent and very deep. Some will complain about that it was Rated R, but after seeing this movie, I believe there was no other way to tell this story. It is not violent to just be violent like some other action stories. Every scene has its purpose, and I do not believe the depth of this story could be told in a PG-13 environment. I am sad this will be Jackman's last time playing this role, but I could not dream of a better story/ending for the end of his time as the character. Please see this movie. It is not a comic book movie, it is just a GREAT movie.",10,0,3,5 March 2017
The Witch," Different type of 'horror'
","As other reviewers have said, 'The Witch' is not a movie that scares you with the tired old tricks, or tries to make you jump out of your seat. It did chill me to the bone, however. The setting, the dialogue, the score, a goat named Black Phillip, all worked well together to creep me the hell out.I was a bit disappointed by the ending, or maybe just confused by the choice to end it in that manner. I'd still recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining, different, kind of movie. Great to see some originality these days.Also, Black Phillip, may be the best name of any character (human or animal) ever.",8,1,5,21 February 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","I don't leave many reviews on here, but I do read many of them. I appreciate the information passed on here. So I felt it necessary to warn others about this film.It is awful. It is honestly the first movie I've left early from. I was falling asleep twenty minutes into it. For fans of 50's movies, or how Hollywood was run back then, they may enjoy it. I just couldn't stand it any longer. Yawn.I gave it three stars because Josh Brolin was great in the scenes I did stay awake for. Also had some neat cinematography.My advice: Save your money.",3,18,31,8 February 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Amazing
","I cannot remember a movie this polarizing. Fans absolutely love it or hate it. After seeing it twice, I loved it. I know we all have different views on things, but here are a few of my thoughts:Ben Affleck was great as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I never really had a doubt that he wouldn't be. He brought a unique take to the character that I enjoyed. Same can be said for Gal Gadot. Although her time on screen was limited, she was very captivating. So many things worked well together under the direction of Snyder. The score and cinematography were just epic. From the very first minute I was hooked.This movie had its faults though. I was able to look past them, but I can understand why others refuse to. The movie just had so much it had to get in, the plot got a bit crazy. The justice league tie-ins would have been better as an after credit scene. Not right before the epic fight between Batman and Superman. And yeah some of the CGI made me laugh. But if you can't suspend your disbelief and enjoy this stuff, why are you at this movie to begin with? Overall, I think Snyder did a great job. He took the movie where a marvel movie would never go, which was refreshing to me. It felt real. It portrayed the fear I think we would all have of a man with the kind of power Superman has. Kudos to all involved. 9/10.",9,4,10,3 April 2016
Deadpool," Good Fun
","Deadpool has a simple plot. Revenge. It also has a ton of comedy, vulgarity, and violence. Simply put, it was fun to watch. Ryan Reynolds was obviously very comfortable in this role and he nailed it. Great supporting cast as well.I enjoyed how the movie opened up with a Deadpool scene and used flashbacks to give his origin story. My only complaint with the origin story is the whole we are going to save you from cancer by torturing you and turning you into a mutant thing, which still confuses me.I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because of the humor, the great cast, and the excellent action scenes. Glad I watched.",8,2,11,19 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Best Action Movie in years
","John Wick surpassed expectations in 2014 with a simple plot. Revenge. It left many doors open for a sequel, and wow did Chapter 2 really impress. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and he was surrounded by an excellent supporting cast (Ian Mcshane, Ruby Rose, Common, Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishbourne). Chad Stahelski knows how to make an action movie matter. Every scene was meaningful. Every character was understood. I could almost feel every punch, and take every shot. Stahelski used a perfect combination of lighting and a great score for his downright brutal action scenes. Chapter 2 was almost exclusively focused on the 'underground assassins' world and it did not disappoint. It was amazing to watch how these larger than life super killers can blend into society so easily. I like how this society has two very important and non negotiable rules that seem to always keep things in order. Which is hard to do. I feel like I could write for hours about this movie, but I do not want to give any spoilers. Please go and enjoy. Several times. And let us all hope for Chapter 3 very soon.",10,26,52,11 February 2017
