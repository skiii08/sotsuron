Skyfall," worst bond yet
","It could of been much better plot and more than one villain seems rushed with poor bond girls should of waited until on DVD instead of going to movies, script writers are from the TV series the A Team with more bullets flying around than a day in Afghanistan with out bond been hit. When he does get shot its with a depleted uranium round which would make him very ill and cause death if left in him as long as it was. Why oh why spoil a good franchise with such a poor effort,Daniel Craig is the right bond but let down by poor casting of actors who are not up to it.I honestly think i could of done a better job at writing a film and cast better actors ,i think it was also done on a budget",4,16,34,5 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Give me more
","I have not been to the cinema in ages but my 10 year old son nagged me to see it,i was expecting a load of rubbish but it was out of this world,i loved it and cannot wait for the next film,both me and my son laughed and never got bored even though the film is 2 hours long.I will get this on DVD for my son when it comes out,well for both of us. The action scenes are fantastic with all the characters adding to make the film a sure fire hit with the special effects that are the best i have seen,Groot and Rocket are brilliant and the ending is good. I was put off with it been sci-fi so don't miss the film or be put of because of it.",10,6,11,2 August 2014
