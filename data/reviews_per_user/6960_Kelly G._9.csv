The Blair Witch Project," A new classic with only two minor flaws.
","Since my comment will be buried under hundreds of others within weeks of it's posting, I'll keep it very brief.First of all, it's a classic. It met almost all of my expectations that the last three months of underground hype built up. Seeing this, I felt exhilarated that I was watching horror movie history unfold. It was kind of the equivalent of taking Mr. Peabody's Way-Back machine to the 60's to see the original 'Psycho', or to the 70's to see 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.I only had two, VERY MINOR, problems.#1. The sound level. I know the directors wanted this to seem very real, and that digitizing the sound would have ruined the realism. But the movie was so quiet, I felt they lost an opportunity to utilize the sophisticated sound systems that most theatres have. The low volume also makes it possible to hear what other moviegoers are saying. I saw the movie in a packed house at midnight, and unfortunatly just a few jerk-off screen talkers who kept laughing at inappropriate moments almost totally ruined the vibe of the film. That's why I wanted it louder, I wanted something to drown them out.#2. I wanted a bit more back story. I knew that the web site to the film had lots of neat information about the town history of massacres, and how the tapes were found. To my surprise, almost none of that was in the film. Now I know that part of what makes this so scary is it's self-contained ambiguity. But I still wanted a little more near the beginning about the history of the town. The fact that the producers leaned too hard on the website for details was the one element of it's promotion I didn't care for.But as I said above, these are very minor quibbles that didn't keep me from enjoying what, ten years from now, will be considered to be a classic.",9,1,1,2 August 1999
Scarface," Crime doesn't pay.
","'Scarface' is one of those films where I saw it, liked it, then kind of forgot about it a few months later. But after a friend recently gave me the film for my birthday (Hi Kari!) I can't believe I ever let a single frame of this pass from my memory.My problem with most movies involving orginized crime is that they seem kind of dry and/or monochromatic. Now don't get me wrong, I like a good drama as much as anyone else, but after a while, you see one gangland rubout and you've seen them all.Brian DePalma, in effect, gives the gangster movie a lobotomy, reducing this to it's simplest elements, and then amplifying them. In its three hour running time we have countless shootings (all bloody), a wonderful chainsaw murder, massive drug usage, non-stop profanities, and other trappings of wall to wall decadence. And who could forget the epic final shootout?Like most of DePalma's other films, one can sense the director's detachment from the material, as if the events depicted are so over the top in their presentation, that they seem to be taking place on another planet. I guess that's what I've always liked about his work.After viewing this film, which even with its 3-hour running time rushes by at top speed, one doesn't feel like they have watched an accurate depiction of organized crime, but a horror movie version of it instead.That's a compliment.",Null,0,0,7 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I think time will prove kind to this one.
","I wanted some time to go by before I commented on this one. Probably because I knew that my humble opinion would have been buried underneath hordes of others. So now that both the sound and the fury of marketing have died down, I'll speak my peace.Of course it's hard to look at this film in the final analysis because the entire cycle hasn't been completed yet, but to me the film feels like an overture of sorts, where the orchestra strikes up a loud and bombastic fanfare so that you know what's in store for the rest of the show, and so you feel good that you spent so much money to get in.With my lame simile out of the way, I'll deal with the two major problems other people seem to have had with the movie.#1 The Acting. Yeah, it does feel kind of stiff; but Lucas has always been a much better director of ideas than of people. Although the mannered feel of the dialogue really did hurt the story in a few parts (Any scene with Annikin), I was able to overlook it.#2 Jar Jar. I agree. He's lame. Although I did chuckle when Que-Gon grabs his tounge at the dinner table. And I do have to admit that I'll give Lucas credit for having guts if he decides to bring the character back.So what did I like about it? Well, it was just fun. Now I know that special effects alone can't make a movie good (Armegeddon and Starship Troopers come to my mind), but the breathtaking special effects used here work because they are used in tandem with a rich tapesty of mythology that Lucas has constructed.By the way, if anyone knows what the heck I meant by that, please let me know.Other parts I enjoyed:#1 All the robots.#2 The political double dealing (There was just enough of this for nice flavoring, but not enough to clog up the works)#3 Queen Amidala. Already my favorite character, although I don't know why. I thinks it's because she seems so sad, especially during the confrontation with the senate. She's cute as a button, too.#4 That three-way lightsaber fight. Man, I could watch two whole hours of that.About a month after this was released, I felt kind of lousy because I felt that it was going to be regarded as a failure. But after looking at some recent reviews, I see that maybe viewers will be able to overlook the insurmountable expectations this had to live up to, and just enjoy it as the fun space trip it is.I haven't come close to saying what I really wanted to say about the film, but this will do, I guess.",8,0,0,27 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A positive review from a 'casual fanatic' as well as his more skeptical girlfriend.
","I wasn't really old enough to care about what the critics were saying about the original trilogy. Nor did I have access to sites like this where mass amounts of reviews from print critics as well as from Joe-punchclock are tallied up, indexed, pushed, filed, stamped, briefed, debriefed, and numbered.I shouldn't care now, and to be honest, I still dont. But it still kind of smarts to read some of the avalanche of bad reviews. Not that I'm unaware of the fact that no movie gets complete acceptance, especially not a sci-fi fantasy film, and even more especially one that's a sequel to a series that so many people love. But wow, why are some of these reviews so bitter? Why are so many people acting like someone poured sugar in their mom's gas tank while watching this? Deep down, I know the reason why, ever since Empire, people began assuming that it wasn't Lucas' series to control, and that it was in his best interest to let other people write and or direct further chapters.This is a sentiment I dont agree with. Heck, I liked Empire too but I wouldn't want to sit through four more episodes just like it. I might as well just watch the Star Trek movies if that's what I was looking for.To me, what's good about Star Wars is how every film is the same concept filtered through slightly different lenses. In my mind (and sometimes I get the feeling like I'm alone on this one) I DONT EXPECT EACH EPISODE TO LOOK AND PLAY LIKE THE OTHER ONES!!! I've always seen the individual episodes as chapters of a comic book where either the writers and/or artists differ from month to month. Things may look different, and plotlines may seem altered, but the title of the book (um..movie) stays the same and the overall concept remains because of Lucas.When I came out of The Phantom Menace on it's first night, I noted that it wasnt what I was expecting, but I liked it. The first thing I said to my friends when we got to the car was that I would be happy if each of the new episodes was completely different from each other. And after seeing ATOC I was pretty happy to see that's exactly what Lucas is trying to do. See how each film differs....Episode 1: A glossy comic book full of kid-oriented action and humor, where a young boy gets the chance to be more than what fate has handed him, with action scenes that rarely involve the death of human characters. While in the background, misty complex conspiracies begin to form.Episode II: A meditation on what can happen when a gifted person uses his or her abilities go to misuse through greed and or unchecked ambition, or let themselves be manipulated by people with different agendas. Also, the first inkling of long held institutions realizing that the principles they once stood for are being eroded away.Episode IV: The Template; A young man with no future gets a chance at being more than he is, or if you like, is thrust into an adventure that he was always fated to take part in. Meanwhile, the issues of governmental corruption get laid to rest as The Empire makes that corruption The Rule.Episode V: A Pausing; Good characters get routed early on, and flee to safe areas, only to meet defeat at every turn despite their best efforts. Kind of like watching a basketball team suffer a heartbreaking loss in overtime. Like ATOC, what makes it good is that it's protagonists (who usually appear as a fighting unit) go though long portions of the film separated from each other.Episode IV; A slam-bang conclusion where beat down and taxed out rebels make a desperate attack, and a hero must make a choice between his past and future, while a former hero must make a choice between his 'father' and son. Slammed for not really advancing the plot, this is the end of the series; Where are you going to advance the plot to?Long winded dissertation aside, I'm getting to my MAIN POINT. I took my girlfriend to see this film (yes, a star wars fan can have a girlfriend) and was quite nervous about what she would think. She's a more old-school fan who loves the original Star Wars, thinks Empire is genius, and dismisses ROTJ as one lone battle scene. As for The Phantom Menace, she didn't care for it at first, but she's come around a bit after seeing it a few more times.To me, she represents a lot of SW fans; the kind who don't go to conventions, will call a spade a spade, and slightly distrust Lucas's intentions for the saga. I was delightfully surprised when after the credits started rolling her eyes lit up and she admitted that it's one of the best so far!She was even impressed by the expected battle at the end, noting the strange irony of watching Yoda ride to the rescue with a horde of stormtroopers at his back.As for Yoda fighting, yeah it's a bit cheezy, but HUGE portions of the saga so far have been slightly corny anyway. It's kind of funny reading some reviewers (especially Roger Ebert, who it should be noted disliked ATOC for the same reasons he liked TPM) bending themselves over backwards to not just go with it and enjoy the scene, babbling some weird theory about how CG making the unreal real dampens the imagination. Whatever. Watching Yoda battle Christopher Lee has to be a landmark of some kind in the minds of long time Horror/sci-fi fans who have spent years respecting both characters and actors in the scenario.And the melancholic ending nails that confused 'uh, we won..didn't we? Right?' confusion that Empire was praised for so many years ago.Sure the acting and dialogue is a bit iffy at time, but it's certainly not bad enough to ruin the film. People who send in reviews posting line by line the dialouge that they didn't care for really need to get lives. And hey, at least there are lines to remember, good or bad. Not like Lord of the Rings, where months after seeing it me and my friends still don't know the difference between 'big guy with beard' or 'effeminate dude with arrows', let alone anything they might have said.Ahhh. sorry. I was going to try to get though this without revealing myself as a LOTR non fan (God, it was long and pretentious, wasn't it?)So, in closing, I'd like to bring it back to the girlfriend thing. If you are a casual fan like her who likes ATOC (or even more so, liked TPM) and is feeling guilty about it; Take care, there are plenty of non-freaky SW fans who like the prequel trilogy so far, and are more than willing to place it in with the originals.",8,0,0,3 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Ring is good, but it wont change your life.
","After scanning the user comments, it certainly seems that they are almost all written by people who are familiar with the books. I mean VERY familiar. And before I say anything else, I will point out that I'm a pretty big fan of Star Wars, so it's not like any one hasn't called me an over-obsessed fan before.The theater was packed full on opening night for this one, and these people were obviously already clued in on what was going to happen. The girls sitting across the aisle from me were the type of fanatical fantasy fan who instantly remind people of the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons. Good God, they were practically setting up gamemaster screens and rolling for Frodo's hit points during every scene.Now I'm not putting down fans of the film, I'm only mentioning this because I think the only people we are hearing from at this early stage in the film's release are the inner circle of Ring devotees. But for people who have never read a word of the novels, and dont really plan to, Fellowship is certinly a great film, full of imagination and love for it's source material; But it's also a film sandbagged by its own history. With the exception of a few startling moments (the opening battle scene, and any moments with the great Christopher Lee), I found this to be a rather joyless experience that made me feel like I was on the outside looking in.I think Peter Jackson spent so much time and energy into pleasing the fans of the book, who will practically fill a sock full of 20-sided dice as weapons to defend their love of the series, that he made this seem not like a fantastical journey, and more like a audio/visual lecture on what us laypeople should have been reading all these years.Watching this, I could easily see a tight and lean motion picture here. And before anyone starts flaming me, I certinly don't mean it should be edited down to anything under 90 minutes. I understand part of what's good about the series is the richness of it's characters and situations. But this could have been trimmed down to about two and a half hours, and been an absolute juggernaut. As it is now, it seems like a sloppy love note to the fans.I hear you Ring fans, before you even start. But all of the characters who are introduced (with little or no characterization) that screech the movie to a halt are important to you because you have a dog-eared copy of the book in every room of your house. But as for me and my friends, walking out of this one we started talking about the characters and belive it or not, outside of Frodo and Gandalf, we couldn't think of one of their names (we settled on 'guy with the arrows' or 'the dwarf with the beard',) and dont even get us started about the needless baffoonery antics of the extra hobbits thrown into the mix.And the ending? I felt angry enough to shout down every hand clapping in the theatre with a boo large enough to knock the screen down. Just stopping the film with no resolution WHATSOEVER may be faithful to the book, and it will please fans who already plan on seeing the rest of the series sight unseen, but for those of us just stopping by to see what the fuss is all about, it's an awfully arrogant way to end your picture. A trilogy that forces the viewer to fork over more money for part two, while not offering a nugget of closure in its opening segment, or at least trying to make the parts enjoyable separately, seems awfully smug to me. Further evidence that this is intended for fans, none of whom seemed to blink twice as the screen faded to black. Whatever.Ring is a good film. I enjoy it more in retrospect than I did in the theatre. It's got more imagination and passion in fifteen minutes than overcooked crud like Armageddon, although both it and this film suffer from a lack of assertive female characters (say what you want, Tyler and Blanchett exist here only to look like pretty porcelain figurines in midst of the woods).I had fun watching this, and saw a wonderfully creative film from one of my favorite directors. But for whatever reason, it just didn't connect with me the same way it is with everyone else. It will be interesting to see just what happens to the film after the hype dies down and the Burger King light-up goblets start collecting dust. I have a feeling it will do what every other blockbuster will do; Slowly descend down the charts, and shuffle to a lifetime on DVD sales. Frankly, I'll wait until they are all available for home viewing before watching them.Does anyone know when Attack of the Clones comes out? I'll see you there.",5,1,2,21 December 2001
Being John Malkovich," Hate to be a gloomy gus, but.....
","I was expecting to love this movie, as almost all the reviews I read for it were positive. But overall I felt it was such a wonderous idea held back by a dark and dreary look, as well as unlikeable characters. I can't stand it when a movie presents you with a protagonist that you start out rooting for, before the screenplay turns him into a jerk. As for the story, I certinly got it's meaning, and did laugh a few times ('Maybe even Gary Sinese!'), but after it was over I just felt...well, depressed. I guess imagination can do that to you.",Null,0,0,22 May 2000
Scream 2," Aging gracelessly.
","The first time I saw this, I liked it better that the first 'Scream' because it seemed like this one wasn't nudging you in the ribs the whole time trying to show you how scary it was. (It wasn't.) But after a recent reviewing, I realized that this over-caffeinated sequel suffers from exactly the same reasons the first one did.1. Too much fat. i.e. Too many needless characters clogging up the screen only to provide fodder for the tired 'guess who the killer is' routine., and so the marquee will be filled with recognizable names. I've complained for many a year about how these post-'Scream' films are packed with the latest teen actors who are only in this new horror market to beef up their resumes. 'Scream 2' in particular has an over-abundence of inneffectual appearances, meaning way too much of the overrated Sarah Michelle Gellar, and not enough of the underrated Aphrodite of the silver screen Rebecca Gayheart. (She really is cute.)2. The guessing game.  Guessing who the killer was in the first 'Scream' worked because it was kind of unexpected. Unfortunately it's a device that can only be used once effectively. Being a cinematic technique that relies primarily on suprise, it dosen't work if the audience is expecting one of the characters to be the killer. But since everyone who went to see this knew that one of Sidney's friends was the killer, and that the climax has to be bigger than the last, the 'Guessing-Game' concept becomes a self-defeating one when you realize that since everyone is a suspect, logically it's impossible to suprise the audience no matter who ends up being the killer.3. The 'hip' factor.  I suppose the constant mentions of other horror movies is intended to be a form of tribute. In the first 'Scream' that worked to a certain extent because the characters FELL PREY to the cliches that they were making fun of. In this movie however, these references seem more like name-dropping. Here the characters argue (in a classroom scene so self-consciously forced it makes me cringe every time I see it) about whether sequels are lame. In the end, it's the MOVIE ITSELF that falls pray to this argument, not the characters. 'Scream 2' doesn't just nudge, but practically SHOVES the viewer in a desperate attempt to show how 'clever' it's being, almost giving it the attitude that it's above its subject matter.Still, in spite of my rambling, this isn't a failiure. Neve Campbell is intelligent enough to make for a great heroine. You always want her to survive. That's the primary factor in this series' success. Also, there's a great opening sequence in a movie theatre that seems similar to the inspired chaos of Italian filmmaker Dario Argento.Not bad, but I have a feeling this film, and any others in this series will eventually suffer the same fate of the sequels of other horror franchises 'The Howling' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' in that they will just be forgotten.",Null,0,0,7 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The verdict is in: Fanboys SUCK!
","I liked both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in spite of their obvious flaws. But even knowing that chances are I was probably going to like Revenge of the Sith, or at least give it more of a lighter critical touch, I had to shake my head and laugh at all the people who thought Lucas was finally going to put the naysayers to rest with this one.Yea, right.Just like I predicted, after an initial wave of accolades and applause, the haters are back in full force, chopping away at this film with every thing they've got, almost thrilled that they get the chance to make sure everyone in the universe who has an internet connection gets to see that they hate the movie, hate lucas, hate computer special effects, hate hayden christensen, hate, hate, hate, hate, haaaaaaaaaate. Just like they did with Episodes I and II, The Matrix sequels, The Two Towers, Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4, X-Men, Narnia, King Kong, Land of the Dead, and on and on and on forever.That's the problem with fanboys; they all think they are writers, or that the movies they see should be made to their exact specifications. And if they aren't, well you didn't just disappoint them, but you ruined their life.On a long enough timeline, fanboys will tear down any empire they have a hand in building up. It's just their nature. Let me put it this way; A director or a writer who creates a fandom is like a god who creates his own society of worshipers willing to give praise at whatever he or she created. But when that god decides to take a break and leave his creation alone by stepping away and closing the lid on his little ant farm of fans, he doesn't realize that while he's gone, those fans in the dark have no new product to feed off of, so they turn on each other, cannibalizing the movies they are left with for food, and their fellow fans who don't agree with them.So someday, when their happy god comes back with a NEW creation to drop in their midst, they find after they lift the lid that the once happy little worshipers are now feral mutants so changed from lack of attention that anything you feed them now will be spit back up in their god's face.Now this may be a stretch to believe, but search your feelings. deep down, you know this to be true. You've no doubt taken a spin across the Internet and read the tons of pure hatred that these 'fans' have for any number of product that doesn't fulfill them. Could any movie have made them happy? I suppose so, after all, Peter Jackson seemed to have survived this psycho ant farm phenomenon with Lord of the Rings (although just wait for what happens when King Kong comes out).But please, scroll down through some of the user comments here. Page after page of one star invectives, with the writers almost THRILLED that they get to report that Star Wars is finally 'Dead' or whatever else.Obviously these people weren't going to like ANY Star Wars movie unless we pried Irvin Kirsner out of this little hole and broke out all the puppets, and had ILM spend millions of dollars building the greatest plastic models you've ever seen on screen.That's not to say that ROTS is perfect; It isn't. Actually, it suffers from the same problems that the previous episodes did. But geez, don't trust the fanboy venom any more than you'd trust a slobbering 10/10 review either.So, the film itself. Well, it is the best of the three prequels. It's certainly the most passionate, with moments of real fun and genuine emotion being on display.Yes, there's lots of CG (check your calender, it's 2005), yes the talking droids are silly, yes the plot be-bops around a lot, yes the dialog flubs a little, but for some reason, none of this really bothered me that much, or at least not enough to shake my general impression of the movie as a whopping dose of space opera action. One that makes a connection to the original trilogy much better than even I could have expected.I don't know how episode III will fare as the years go by, if it will be placed with the originals or spat on like episode I and II. But I like it, and despite what you may read from some fat naked guy on his computer with dogeared copies of Starlog and Fangoria around him, most people (and critics) agree with me.",8,3,5,2 June 2005
The Thin Red Line," All vision and no plot makes 'Thin' a dull film.
","What angers me most about fans of this film is that they claim that people who disliked this movie because of its length (an excruciating 170 minutes!), or the fact that there are virtually no identifiable characters are just half-wits who want to be 'spoon-fed' the latest Hollywood special effects blockbuster. Well as a person who does appreciate cinematic quality, I was bored with this film's ten ton ego.I don't care how powerful a director's vison might be, you can't have a film, especially a three hour one, that doesn't have a storyline. Now I know that film students who have no doubt studied every millisecond of the movie would disagree with that vehemently. I can understand their viewpoint since I WANTED to like this film. On a visual level it certainly has its moments. I could definitely tell the movie was trying to say something. But without solid characters (I'm sorry, but any argument that these characters are anything but half-finished sketches is pure bunk!) the heavy message of the film hits the floor with nothing to hang onto. And no, the constant narrations, which sound at times like passages from a Moody Blues album, didn't help since I didn't believe for a second that anybody in this situation would really have something like that going through their mind.Still, I didn't hate this movie. I was impressed with its intent. In a way it does make 'Saving Private Ryan' seem kind of childish. And that's no easy task. But a little characterization can go a long way.I don't usually give number ratings, but as an example of how this movie affected me, my rating shows how the impressive visuals and the non-existant characters and plot cancel each other out.(5 out of 10)",5,1,2,5 March 1999
