Alien 3," Underrated
","First off, I agree with the consensus that this isn't as good as the first two.Alien was sci-fi horror. Ground breaking and much-imitated since. Ridley Scott, say no more.Aliens was a war film (elite unit dropped behind enemy lines). Nothing we hadn't seen before but brilliantly written, acted, directed. James Cameron, say no more.AlienÂ³ is a character study, and a damned good one. David Fincher, say what?This is a stylish debut from Fincher, who had yet to make his name with such classics as Se7en and Fight Club. He had been directing music videos up till this point but clearly had bigger ideas.The tone of the film *is* pretty dark and despairing but I always liked that too. The claustrophobic atmosphere created by the story and setting, the set design and photography builds to a tense climax. The story itself is quite simple, but for me it's enough. The quality of the acting is all the more prominent for not being obscured by a convoluted story. It also benefits from going back to its roots and only having the one alien on the prowl, as opposed to the hordes in Aliens.I'm English and one of the things I've always loved about this film is the roll call of English character actors in it ... Charles Dance, Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Pete Postlethwaite and some others. Charles Dance in particular lends a lot of class to proceedings and I can't imagine anyone else in the role.I watched this in the cinema on its release and have always had a higher opinion of it than most. I've watched it many times since then and still enjoy it.",8,1,1,8 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The plot is the main problem - big holes, silly reasons and cheap, cheesy tricks
","I'm no fanboy, but I'm not a hater either. I've watched 15 or so of the MCU films and I've loved a few of them (Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Avengers Assemble, Civil War, Ragnarok) and at least enjoyed most of the rest.The plot really is the problem here. The characters do stupid or out of character things just to move the film forward.My biggest problem is the scene on Titan where Iron Man, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Star Lord, Drax & Mantis try to take the gauntlet from Thanos. Once Mantis has Thanos' mind subdued there was any number of ways in which they could have won the fight right there. In fact, they *were* winning the fight. They nearly had the gauntlet off (in the slowest, most difficult way possible ... why didn't they hack Thanos' arm off?) Instead, they bicker like children and Starlord slaps Thanos, breaking the mind control allowing Thanos to win and escape. This was so unsatisfying as to spoil the whole film for me.I totally didn't buy Thanos' love for Gamora. That came out of nowhere and was just a cheesy plot device to elicit an emotional reaction from the audience. It also provided a framework to hang the recovery of the soul stone on, otherwise it would have been as exciting as a UPS delivery.On the subject of Thanos, his motive for assembling the stones is lame. To snap his fingers and destory half of the beings in existence. For 'balance'. Wut? Ok, it makes a terrifying objective, but is very shallow.Another recurring problem was the complete lack of logic in some of the fights. There's a basic problem of combining ordinary humans, albeit highly skilled and trained, with superhumans, be they gods, titans, aliens or whatever. Characters that were utterly outclassed inexplicably lasted more than a few seconds.Black Widow against any of the Black Order should have only one outcome, very quicly. The Black Order wiped the floor with Scarlet Witch and Vision (who is powered by an Infinity Stone!) yet Black Widow doesn't die against them. Twice. BW is cool and all, but is just an un-augmented, highly skilled human. Sorry, nah. Also, that Black Order dude who wrapped Thor up in metal at the start gets killed cheesily by Iron Man blowing a hole in his spaceship. Nah, not buying that either. Thanos' power was theoretically increasing hand over fist (sorry) with every Infinity Stone he gained, but he won or lost fights throughout the film not based on how powerful he is but by whether or not the plot need a win or loss to move forward. Many other encounters in this logicless vein.Cheesy deaths. You just know that most of the characters who died will come back. Therefore there is no gravitas to any of it. Cheap tricks.It *was* visually spectacular and I thought the script was pretty good, where it wasn't labouring under ridiculous plotting. The action scenes were spectacularly good as usual, if wildly illogical at times.Overall, not as satisfying as I wanted it to be. Like I say, i'm no fanboy but I was ready to love this film.",6,1,1,27 December 2018
The Big Short," A fascinating, exhilirating look at the GFC
","I really enjoyed this. It's a great story, and they told it well. I liked the straight to camera stuff, the celebrity expositions of some of the financial details like CDOs were good, the analogies were insightful. I have a little understanding of the subject matter due to reading around the subject since the GFC (I've not read the book though), and I didn't have any trouble following the ins and outs of the storyI don't know if any of the real life characters would object to their portrayals, but I liked all the performances. This story has a bit of an epic sweep to it and many more characters in it than you'd usually find in a film, they did well to bring them to life and differentiate them.Steve Carrell continues to impress in dramatic roles and there weren't any bad performances. It's paced well, the story moves along briskly. In fact, I could have stood for a bit more time being spent on some of the financial details, but I think that I'm in a minority there ;-)9/10 I'll watch this again.",9,1,1,15 December 2018
Contact," Flawed but truthful and thought provoking
","I rate this 9 out of 10. Matthew McConaughey is the minus 1. In time I may assess his performance differently. I like Parker as a character, but it could have been cast better.There is so much to see and enjoy in this film. Ellie was traumatised by her father's death, he was a loving father, they were very close. An only child, she was deprived from an early age of close human CONTACT. Ellie's obsession with SETI is easily understood.I love the juxtaposition of science and religion, oops, sorry, SPIRITUALITY in the film, as played out in the characters of Ellie and Joss (Foster and McConaughey). There is always some antagonism throughout the film between the two, sometimes between the principals, sometimes between ancillary characters, but there is sympathy too. Kent (Fichtner) is present when Ellie travels because of 'a higher power' McConaughey). When she, the hardened empiricist, has a deeply spiritual experience, he is the only one to accept what she says at face value. But then again, Joss is the reason why she wasn't chosen first. Which leads me to ...Drumlin (Skerrit) and the religious nutter (Busey) both die. Why, in terms of the morality play subtext, isn't definite, at least not to me, but a first guess would be: Drumlin is too glib, he tells the selection panel 'exactly what they want to hear', he is too political. Busey is too narrow minded, he cannot see beyond what he has always known, he refuses to grow, to evolve beyond our current condition, a major theme of the film. Both, in their own distinct ways, are off track.All through the film the contest between the scientific and the spiritual is played out. It is quite skillful in that it manages to pose questions without giving easy answers, we are left to ponder for ourselves.And then, on top of everything else, John Hurt as Drummond is a delight :-) 'The first rule of government spending: Why have one when you can have two at twice the price?' A bit hammy, perhaps, but very enjoyable.On a final note, I'd like to say that I've only just watched this film for the third time, having seen it at the cinema the first time, eagerly anticipated. The first two times, I was extremely irritated by it, by McConaughey principally, but also by what I saw at the time to be the lame nature of the tension between science and spirituality. I'm a lot more sympathetic to the spiritual these days, and hence enjoyed Contact a lot more.I'm not surprised that the story is from a Carl Sagan book, rather than being formulaic Hollywood fare.",9,0,2,31 March 2005
