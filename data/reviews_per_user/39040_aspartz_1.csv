Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Aimed at to young an audience, too little dialog
","This movie, while OK, fails in one major respect:  It's attempt to add something for the kids, added items that most adults find irritating  Also, looking back, 'A New Hope' seemed to be targeted at the16-30 age group, while this one seems aimed primarily at elementary kids.  One final note:  This segment also seems to have the least dialog and most time filling eye candy FX of the series.",5,0,1,7 April 2000
