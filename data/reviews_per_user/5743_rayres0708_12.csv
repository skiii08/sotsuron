Blade Runner 2049," Masterpiece
","If you enjoyed the original Blade Runner, you will be impressed by this film. I was blown away. The plot, the acting, the aesthetics - everything is executed to near perfection. The pacing slows a bit at hour 2, but picks back up for the conclusion. The story is compelling and beautifully rendered. The theme is sewn throughout in a way that isn't overly simplified or explained constantly with dunbed-down dialogue. Ryan Gosling impresses with his consistent acting, and Jared Leto is consistently creepy. Harrison Ford shows he's not done yet.The truly amazing part of this movie is the fact that they have captured the look and feel of the original. The music, cinematography, and scenery are all beautiful homages to the original. Yes, they're updated (naturally-it's been 30 years in Blade Runner world). But not in the way the Star Wars prequels pissed all over the originals. And the CGI is flawless.Watch this movie. Put your phone down and actually take in every scene. It's worth it?",9,0,9,15 December 2019
In Bruges," Yes.
","Everything about this movie is perfect. The writing is absolutely hilarious, even dealing with heavy subject matter. The setting is beautiful. The story is totally original. Brendan Gleeson is a pleasure to watch. Colin Farrell does the best acting I've ever seen him do. Ralph Fiennes is creepy and funny all at once. It's definitely worth a watch.",8,1,2,8 March 2020
That Thing You Do!," A classic
",I saw this movie for the first time as an 11 year old. Since then I have watched it probably fifty times. It's absolutely perfect. I love the aesthetics of the 60s. The cast is great and the script is hilarious. Seriously there is nothing to criticize about this movie.,10,2,2,4 March 2020
Aquaman," Nope.
","I was gonna give this a couple stars for effort, but then there was an octopus drumming. So nope. One star.",1,2,2,3 November 2019
Aquaman," DC needs to get their sh** together.
","There are so many things wrong with this movie. The acting is mediocre. The script feels like it was written by a 12-year-old boy. The CGI is inexcusably cheesy. The plot is not compelling. The jokes aren't funny. They kept explaining things that I don't care about. Ocean Master. Trident of Atlan. Robots in ancient Atlantis. Blah, blah, blah. So. Much. Exposition.
I have hated the last several DC films, Wonder Woman being the least terrible. This one is officially the worst. If you want something about Atlantis, the Disney one was way better.",1,2,2,3 November 2019
Moana," An instant classic
","I grew up on Disney movies, and now I get to enjoy them with my three little girls. This movie is hands down one of Disney's best. The story is absolutely beautiful and honoring of the culture that inspired it. The animation is entrancing and flawless. The characters are complex and we'll developed. The music is insanely catchy and fun. I have seen it at least twenty times, and I still cry like a baby multiple points throughout the movie. The morals are inspiring - strength, courage, self confidence. I cannot say enough good things about this movie!",10,1,1,24 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Ignore the negative hype!
","IN A GALAXY NOT SO FAR AWAY, where Star Wars is more divisive than politics....People who hated this movie probably loved the prequel trilogy. I have zero major critiques of this movie, but admittedly I generally love JJ Abrams' work. I thought this movie was the best of the trilogy, and I'm glad Abrams had the chance to bring his vision from The Force Awakens to fruition. I thought The Last Jedi was boring and out of place in the Star Wars universe. Abrams brought everything together without completely giving Rian Johnson the middle finger. He answered all of our questions and gave us insight into more details about force/Jedi/Sith lore. The movie overall was well acted, fun, exciting, and moving. I laughed, cried, and caught myself smiling several times. It was a fan' love letter to the original trilogy, and I can't imagine it coming to a close in a better way.",10,4,19,28 December 2019
Divergent," Great book adaptation
","This is a faithful adaptation of Veronica Roth's bestseller. If you liked the book, you'll appreciate the way they made this movie. I've seen others compare it to the Hunger Games books/movies, but I didn't feel that's a fair or relevant comparison. Divergent is a compelling and exciting novel and movie in its own right, and definitely worth a read and watch!",9,0,0,8 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Perfect Tarantino
","People who don't like this movie must not care for Tarantino. His style is unique and understated, up until it hits the fan. The first two hours are not slow or boring. It's everything you love about Hollywood in the 60s, with perfectly parsed out character development and foreshadowing, followed up by incredibly satisfying gratuitous violence that rewrites history. I was hesitant to watch this film because I knew Sharon Tate and her baby and her friends' terribly sad fate. But Tarantino grants the viewers their fairy tale ending, with justice for the evil and life for the characters we've grown attached to throughout the film. And speaking of the characters, Pitt, Robbie, and DiCaprio each hit it out of the park - not to mention the huge supporting cast. I think this is my new favorite Tarantino film.",9,2,4,11 January 2020
The Lion King," What a disappointment
","I have a ton of respect for Jon Favreau, but he seriously missed it on this one. Past live action remakes Disney have been very good - Cinderella is hands down is my favorite and I like it better than the animated one. But the difficulty this movie faced was translating human emotion into live action CGI animals. It really just falls flat. Which I don't understand, because I thought Jungle Book was really well done and didn't suffer from that problem. And despite the star power, none of the voice acting was impressive. Scar's 'Be Prepared' song was shortened and really just spoken, and not in a Jeremy Irons way that entertains. The rest of the singing was just ok too. Nothing makes me want to watch this movie again. It's slow and frankly just boring.",3,2,2,9 November 2019
1917," A masterpiece
","This movie is absolutely stunning. It looks like it's one single shot, a la Hitchcock's Rope. McKay is a phenomenal actor. He's not upstaged by any of his scenes with bigger names, like Strong, Firth, or Cumberbatch. I've heard others complain about the story, which I don't get. The story is not 100% true. But it honors the memory of those who fought and died in that horrible war. It lays bare the reality of trench warfare without gratuitous violence. It's not a cookie cutter happy ending. But it's satisfying. And really, the cinematography is just mesmerizingly beautiful.",9,1,5,29 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," So good
","This movie is absolutely hilarious and utterly charming. Davis as JoJo is perfect. Waititi as his doofus imaginary Hitler friend is so dang funny. Scarlett Johansson does the best acting of her career. This movie takes something awful and turns it into an entertaining and engaging metaphor, executed perfectly with flawless acting and a great script.",9,1,2,2 April 2020
