Black Swan," Spiral into insanity
","What an incredible portrayal of madness. Of that decent. From mere mediocrity to perfection. That quest. That drive to become the best at whatever it is you are rabid to become. It is within us all, every single last one of us and this film taps into that psyche, that inner self we all have somewhere. Natalie is incredible in this film. How did she not get recognised for this at the highest level? I watched and was caught within the first act, drawn in, left battered and bruised. What this director does is beyond description, beyond word and critique, the only way to know is to experience this amazing portrayal of what it is to be a genius. To suffer the doubts, the insecurities of that existence. Here, on film for the first time is that story. Watch it. Live it and perhaps find something within that you should express to the rest of humanity. Live. Be.",10,1,2,7 October 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," It is actually...
","too short. IF you have read the book and seen the BBC's dramatisation of Le Carre's work then you'll see things that aren't there which added to those tellings of this fabulous story; HOWEVER, this is masterfully acted by Oldman. He is nuanced, from twitch to smile, from silence to noise in the very way Alec Guinness played Smiley. Jesus, he is George Smiley as played by Alec Guinness. Even the voice at times, exactly the same. Absolutely brilliant. The sets, the scenes the attention to detail of the 70s spot on, again, lovingly crafted. The film is paced just as the book / BBC, a slow burning crescendo realising Smiley's quiet genius. I love this film but for me it'S only failing is its fast run, omission of scenes, play, intrigue. Can not WAIT for the rest. Who will play Karla, other than Smiley of course! (Get it?) If you don't get drawn in, held and suspended by this film... get back to Arnie, who's MOVIES I do relish by the way. Gary, again, thank you for such a great act.",10,1,4,15 January 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Fails visually
","FMJ is incredible until Pyle goes --understandably-- off the deep end. After that it fails to keep me in the realm of its intended purpose; it's just so obviously not set in Asia, never mind Vietnam; even the helicopters ain't the correct hardware maaan. All that legendary Kubrick meticulous scrutiny to detail simply seems 'absent' in this film's second half: when the theater goes 'Asia'. So because of his other films 'rea;ity' it annoys the crap out of me that he goes 'half-arsed' with this. The palm trees aren't even the native ones to that part of the world and they look planted because they are.The script; however, is simply divine. So, if I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is reality. It's all in a breath. Should it have been filmed in Asia and not the South East of England? 'Yes'.",Null,2,5,12 November 2006
Man of Steel," Mediocre
","No John Williams' score. Dragons?? Seriously... Dragons? Krypton's 'wildlife' should have been kept completely out of it --even if there is any. There was a very odd dynamic between the two star spangled lovers --trying too much to make the story 'different', it failed to carry this viewer along-- and no white robes on Krypton? A spaceship instead of the ice forming his temple? No British accents? So many things that should have been included were let go, things that worked so well in the original. The original 1978 version is so much better. Zod was not menacing, Zod in the original? You just felt his evil. His insanity. This film? 'Guilty' of being mediocre. Even ,IMHO, Superman Returns was better, a film that should have been built upon, why go back to scratch?",5,3,6,17 August 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Possible Spoiler. Dialogue.
","Why the grasp at cheap laughs? I mean, 'Ori: Have they got any chips?' Absolutely ruined that scene. Just, well, a stupid throw away line that just didn't need to be in the film. Were they American chips or British chips? Confusing for the Americans,' Have they got any chips?' It wasn't quite as bad as Dwarf throwing and shield surfing, but still, Pete, use the noggin' > DO IT SMART< Mr Tolkien will stab his pencil in your arm when he gets to see you. Otherwise, apart from the run through the Orc caverns... I mean, STOP it it's not a video game --AND I've told you before Pete, when you did King Kong, that nonsense of falling three kilometres on a log and surviving-- doing that really totally over the top scenario just makes us go 'WTF???' Will you listen to us! As you can craft such wonderful fantasy there is no need to go OTT. The story is magical enough, mate. As for 'chips' Jesus< JUST CRAP> don't do it! xx",7,1,5,2 April 2013
The Mist," Never give up hope.
","Bottom line: Never give up hope. Whatever struggles you have, no matter the incredible odds stacked against you... never stop believing in yourself. You don't need any frills, spin, fairytale or hocus-pocus to get by; to live your life. All that's needed is your own belief in who and what you are. What a kick in the b*lls, what a smack in the jaw as you're left open-mouthed grabbing for some sense of what has just rolled itself over you. It's the ending that makes you see the whole reason you've just let yourself be taken on this journey by King, the ending leaves you breathless, desperate, head shakingly shattered. Believe, don't ever let go of what makes you live, that force that gets you out of bed in the morning.",7,0,2,26 May 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," READ this Q T!!!
","I've lived, existed and worked in Japan for the last ten years and I am absolutely bowled over by the knowledge Mr Tarantino shows in this film. He knows 70's Japanese TV serials, earlier (50's, 60's) Yakuza films and so much more; even an astute insight to contemporary Japanese manga (comics) is as a good as a long termer could expect. This film could be a turn of for those who don't want to or who simply do not know anything about Japan but this film is incredible as a 'mimic of another cultures film genre. The guy is either lucky (I don't believe in luck) or a f***kin genius. I hate and love him for it in the same breath. How dare he be so talented.Uma Thurman's Japanese sucks. He should of chosen ME!!!!!",Null,0,1,24 September 2004
There Will Be Blood," Astounding
","It's a powerful film. We're thrown in, full toss, into the madness of men who must have what they want. Be it the oil in the ground or control over others by economics or 'god'. It's a very American film, in terms of that which it shows; a man striding across the scape, taking what's 'his', bending nature to his will during the ever growing control achievable by the machine age; an excellent portrayal of that mindset 'I am what I conquer'. It explains and gives us the United States of today through its imagery, the sheer bloody mindedness to 'succeed' to take and drink deep, these were the events that created the mythical American dream. That lynch-pin of the entire nation, 'You too, can have it all'. The segment where Plainview --an excellent name for a man so set by his will, so simple in his objective-- strides across the land to the Pacific Ocean, simply brilliant. The whole thing, from the movement, the scenery, to the score.This film describes the seeds of that which gave the nation its purpose, to have it all and f##k anyone who tries to stand taller.A good Hollywood choice, there aren't many that really outclass this.DDL is such a massive presence on the screen, he's the actor I'd be if I'd got that break. :~)",10,0,2,1 November 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Generic flat liner.
","Good grief how in any reality could a person experience this regurgitated pap at a level beyond anything other than poor, mediocre or mind numbing. Not a single aspect of this gave rise to a question of what was going to happen next or the where, what, and why anything was plopping out of the orifice that spawned this really bad movie. I watch anything and everything, from The Saturday Matin√©e B-Monster movie to the confounding complications of art-house works that intrigue... but this was just a total miss. It tells nothing, but takes, takes, takes your time for no just reward. Not even worth a rainy day watch from a a warm bed. Chapter 2 is nothing more than a whole hash of scenes from great films. From Enter the Dragon, to Blade, it's all there but Chapter 2 just comes nowhere near to being anything but a dull turd.3 out of ten for cinematography.",3,2,8,6 July 2017
Donnie Darko," Just Watched the Dir's Cut
","Just experienced another journey with this fascinating piece of work but with this version I found it much more 'contained' and 'linear' and not nearly as provoking as the cinema release. The conclusions, ideas and thoughts of the cinema release were not as 'set' as they are in The Dir's cut, which --when watching it this evening/morning-- made it 'easier' to follow and 'see what was' THUS affecting its purpose which is --surely-- to provoke? With the original cut you have so much more room to 'imagine' and go places that you may well otherwise have not ; nonetheless, beautiful. All done for love.Plus: Opening track in the original is Echo and the Bunny Men, Killing Moon, a much more captivating way to start the film IMHO.",9,2,4,6 January 2007
