The Blair Witch Project," What scares us? This film knows.
","If I asked any horror film connoiseur what the single greatest moment of any horror film is, I would certainly hope the answer would, almost unanimously, be the infamous Shower Scene from 'Psycho,' by Alfred Hitchcock.  Why bring this up in a review of 'The Blair Witch Project, ' you ask?  Because there is something that Hitchcock understood and is evident in everything he did, especially this particular scene.  What this great genius of cinema understood (and many other filmmakers, such as Wes Craven, have forgotten) is that what is truly frightening on screen is not what is seen by the audience, but what is not seen.I'd like to personally thank Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for not only making a modern film masterpiece, but for helping movie-goers remember what it's truly like to be scared.  Not just grossed out, mind you, but truly sincerely scared out of our minds.  'The Blair Witch Project' has done just that, and has done so with startling originality and what I feel is true genius.  While other films may garner more critical acclaim or Oscar nominations, I know of no other film that is as original or as creative as this masterpiece.  Finally, somebody has remembered what Hitchcock learned, and has made this marvel out of it.One truly sad thing about 'The Blair Witch Project' is that it is much too simple and risky for Hollywood.  This film could only have been made independently with first time directors and actors, people who are willing to try anything, and don't know any better.**** out of ****.",10,1,2,6 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force really wasn't with Lucas this time.
","Now, I really can't say that 'Star Wars:  Episode I - The Phantom Menace' is a terrible movie, because it isn't.  However, I also can't say that it is in any way a fitting companion to such masterpieces as 'A New Hope,' 'The Empire Strikes Back,' and 'Return of the Jedi.'  It is, in my opinion, a bad movie that could have been so much better.  Allow me to elaborate.George Lucas is, truly, an enigma.  Not many people can envision characters like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, and Howard the Duck (sic). Also, not many seasoned, experienced filmmakers can make a movie that fails as much as this one.  Lucas has terminally forgotten to write dialogue, and the result is a cast of characters about as deep and profound as their cardboard cut-out counterparts.  Lucas has also forgotten how to hone in on the films strengths.  Namely, these are (1) the special effects, (2) Liam Neeson, and (3) Natalie Portman.  Predictably, the film is a visual wonder, but it is shallow.  The effects are present only to make the audience ooh and ahh in breathless wonder, and it works for a few minutes, but in the long run, they fall short of what they should be.  Liam Neeson is, of course, an outstanding actor.  If you doubt, recall, if you will, 'Schindler's List.'  This film wastes him as yet another shallow character which aspires to be another Obi-Wan Kenobi and fails miserably.  Natalie Portman is, besides being one of the most beautiful young actresses working today, immensely talented.  Well, we've already covered the fact that Lucas doesn't recognize talent, but he also doesn't recognize beauty.  Portman's angelic face is successfully hidden underneath a despicable makeup job which, I think, tries to make her look ugly.  Also, as Princess Amadala's 'alter ego,' Portman is so understated that she fails to make much of an impression.  I admit, having a nice face in this film wouldn't have lifted it up from the depths of failure, but it certainly wouldn't have hurt matters any.  Lucas has also forgotten to try to make the least of weaknesses.  In this case, those are Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd.  Now, I have nothing against computer animated characters, but Jar Jar Binks should rot in Hades.  He is obnoxiously, annoying, and altogether hideous.  Enough about him.  Also, I really don't want to hurt Jake Lloyd's feelings here, but his character was overused.  Lloyd is truly an adorable kid, and very scrappy, but it also seems as if he studied at the Mark Hamill School for Acting, pulling off one 'aw shucks' after another.  Also, he said 'Yippee!!!' about three times too many for my taste.Oh, this film does have one redeeming factor that I can tell.  John Williams' score is, of course, fantastic.  That's about it.So, what am I really saying?  The 'Star Wars' extended trilogy should certainly be continued, but I seriously think our friend George Lucas should stand aside and let someone else try his hand at making the next two films. Trust me, it will help.** out of ****.",Null,0,1,16 November 1999
Citizen Kane," The #1 film ever made? Sure. Why not?
","The A.F.I. list came out not too long ago, and so everyone clamored to see what the number one film ever made was.  Of course emotions were high, as well as tempers.  Of course different people were rooting for different films, as to be expected.  I remember the exact moment when I saw the list. It is actually in the latest issue of Newsweek magazine.  Right there, in black and white, in the number one slot...  'Citizen Kane.'I had never seen 'Citizen Kane', actually, and the list prompted me to do so.  When I saw the film itself, I was shocked.  Here was a slight film, understated, and very simple, really, that had obviously rocked critics everywhere, that had done the impossible.  Here is a first-time filmmaker trying something new, experimenting, if you will, and he ended up making what is considered the greatest film ever produced in America.I wasn't disappointed.  Welles' performance, as well as all of the others, were right on the money, the script was remarkable, and Gregg Toland's camera work took everything I thought to be reality, crumpled it up, and threw it away, never to be rediscovered.I really see little reason to review 'Citizen Kane' as a film.  That has been done enough times, goodness knows.  What I do see fit to do is recommend it.  The average viewer will be bored, of course, because there is no action, no real adventure to be found.  But there is drama, especially for any who see film as film, not so much as a story.  There is suspense, I think, so many times, simply because of a camera move or a well-timed change in placement.  This is film as film, not as anything else.  Absolutely do not miss.**** out of ****.",10,2,4,18 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Why bother comparing it to any other film? It's great on its own right.
","Lots of people don't like John Madden's 'Shakespeare in Love,' I think, mostly because it beat out Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' for the Best Picture Oscar.  But I'm not going to talk about that.  Why?  I'm not going to change anybody's mind, that much is obvious.Well, if you want my opinion, 'Shakespeare in Love' is a superb motion picture.  It is, from every standpoint, a flawless piece of craftmanship. For starters, there is the acting, which is simply top-notch.  This is clearly Gwyneth Paltrow's breakthrough performance, in which she truly delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.  Her character is rich, vibrant, and wondrously alive.  As is Joseph Fiennes' take on Shakespeare.  Even though the Academy didn't see fit to honor him with even a nomination, that is not to say that his performance is bad by any means.  I predict that Fiennes will become a leading man in his own right, thanks to this film, because it is now completely obvious that he is an actor of great depth and enthusiasm, which is something Hollywood greatly needs today.  And who could forget Judi Dench?  The lady is, I think, simply brilliant.  Give her seven minutes of screen time and she turns out a virtual instruction manual on screen acting. Her take on Queen Elizabeth is witty, smart, daring, outrageous, and yet, deceptively simple, that is, all the things the Virgin Queen was herself. And, of course, there is also Ben Affleck and Geoffrey Rush, among others, whose work here sparkles with originality and vitality.But lets get to the real core of what makes 'Shakespeare in Love' a great film.  There is John Madden's effortless direction, and, above all, the amazing script by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.  Seriously, I can imagine people being left in the intellectual dust when they come face to face with this film, because it is what so many films aren't.  It manages to be blazingly intelligent, romantic, exciting, funny, serious, light, profound, historical, and farcical all at the same time, among other things.  The dialogue crackles with energy and originality, and the writers are clearly playing a sort of mental tennis match with the audience.  In the end, both sides win, and it is a glorious victory.**** out of ****.",Null,6,10,25 August 1999
Dead Poets Society," Carpe Diem!
","There are several lessons to be learned in Peter Weir's 'Dead Poets Society,' and while I could go into all of them here, the film teaches them far more eloquently than I ever could.The movie also has several layers.  For instance, there is Professor John Keating (Robin Williams).  He's the new kid on the block, the teacher nobody quite trusts.  He's willing to try absolutely anything to reach his students, and he does.  As I watched Keating work his magic, I was reminded of all my greatest teachers, and it is obvious that Keating is largely taken from real life.  Writer Tom Schulman only made up part of him, because there really are teachers as powerful and as daring as him.  I've had many of them.There are also the students played by Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, and others.  They are accustomed to book teachers, those who move through a text simply for the sake of doing it, with little or no concern for whether the students grasp any of it or not.  Then they meet Keating, with his suggestions for changing our points of view, and his cries of 'Carpe Diem!' Of course they change.  They really have very little choice in the matter.I refuse to spoil the ending.  I will only tell you that it will blindside you if you have a heart, that you will realize all in one fell swoop that the teaching worked, that the students learned something, and, in the process, you learned a lot too.**** out of ****.",Null,0,0,19 August 1999
American Beauty," Life is Beautiful (with apologies to Roberto Benigni)
","Yesterday had, for me, the potential to be a really bad day.  My schedule was hectic and, truly, there weren't enough hours in the day for everything that had to be accomplished.  Under normal circumstances, I would have complained the entire day.  However, I just saw Sam Mendes' 'American Beauty,' so the circumstances were anything but normal.  I honestly couldn't complain because of how much beauty was in the world.This is, in a nutshell, the basic philosophy of 'American Beauty,' one of the finest films any of us will ever see.  Like most summaries, the above is also a gross oversimplification.  The movie is so much deeper, so much more eloquent than any words I could ever say.The movie is, I think, completely flawless.  And, to think that director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball are rookie filmmakers!  The film appears to be the work of seasoned veterans who got especially lucky in the studio.  In addition to that, experienced cinematographer Conrad Hall delivers a predictably outstanding visual production.  The acting is marvelous across the board, particularly from Kevin Spacey and relative newcomer Wes Bentley. All of the characters are seen as real people, and the audience is, of course, electrified.A warning is, of course, in order.  While 'American Beauty' is a superb piece of film, it is also decidedly adult.  There is a great deal of profanity, sexual content, and nudity, but it is never gratuitous.  This is not a film for children.  However, whoever can handle it will experience a truly phenomenal film.  The circumstances are not extremely realistic, and they are not meant to be.  But I guarantee, you will identify with the characters despite the absurdity.'American Beauty' is, in my opinion, a profound cry for meaning in life, for beauty.  There is plenty to go around, because I now realize just how beautiful life really is.**** out of ****.",Null,0,0,9 November 1999
Man on the Moon," Good, but should have been better.
","Several hours have passed since I saw 'Man on the Moon,' and I'm still not quite sure what should be said about it.  It is a peculiar film, to say the least, and it is unique in that it is a comedy with a sad ending, even though it is not really a comedy.  ('American Beauty' is a similar film in that it is a tragedy with a happy ending, even though it is arguably not really a tragedy.)I should say first that 'Man on the Moon' will doubtlessly receive a great deal of critical praise, and the main reason will be Jim Carrey's performance.  As a sort of a low-level movie buff, I can honestly say that I've seen a lot of movies, as well as a lot of great performances.  I do not think it at all presumptuous to say that Jim Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman is not only the best performance of this year, but one of the best of any year.  I never thought I'd be able to say this, but I think Jim Carrey is one of the finest actors working today, as well as one of the most courageous.  Sure, 'Ace Ventura' may not have come even close to making the A.F.I. list, but Carrey has grown and matured.  The first sign of this was with 'The Truman Show,' a fantastic film which set a precedent for Jim Carrey performances yet to come, and 'Man on the Moon' is certainly up to the standard.  Carrey deserves an Oscar for this role.  As a comic figure he will probably not get it.  The Academy never has taken comedians serious enough, so why should they start now?  In summation, it is unfair to say that Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, because the performance is seamless. Rather, Jim Carrey IS Andy Kaufman.  Despite Carrey's immensely recognizable face, one forgets that it isn't Kaufman himself on the screen.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about Carrey's performance is that we still do not understand Andy Kaufman after seeing it.  If any other actor would have played Kaufman, they would have put their own unique stamp on him, making the audience think they understood Kaufman but in reality only understanding one actor's interpretation of Kaufman.  Here, Carrey steps into Kaufman's shoes and changes nothing.  In other words Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman, not Jim Carrey's version of Andy Kaufman.Enough about Carrey's performance.  On to the actual film.  A fan of much of Milos Forman's earlier work (particularly 'Amadeus'), I was immensely disappointed with 'Man on the Moon.'  The overall quality of the film is jaunty, disjointed, and rather nonsensical.  Perhaps Forman's real flaw is that he realizes that Andy Kaufman is an unusual character and jumps to the conclusion that a film about him must be unusual as well.  The result is a mass of characters whose motivations and thoughts make no sense to us and a film that is flawed at best.  We should not understand Kaufman, but we should understand (mostly) everybody else, and this simply doesn't happen.In a nutshell, 'Man on the Moon' is a half-rate film which benefits immensely from a phenomenal performance by Jim Carrey.  My rating of this film is very high, I know, but this is largely due to Carrey.  If anybody else had played Kaufman I probably would have given the film closer to two stars.***1/2 out of ****.",Null,0,0,27 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," As close as I'll ever get to combat.
","It may be silly to say this, but I feel like I just survived World War II. But that's silly, of course I never fought in World War II.  I'm only eighteen years old.  But I still feel like I survived the war, because I just watched Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan.'With most reviews I write for IMDB, I begin writing with a sense of purpose. I know what I want to say and how I want to say it.  This time I'm at a loss.  'Saving Private Ryan' shocked me out of any senses I had left, it disturbed me more than many other movies films ever had.  In fact, the only comparable film I can even think of is another by Spielberg, 'Schindler's List.'  Both classify as what I call 'super-realism.'  The film is so realistic, so believable that one immediately forgets that they are watching actors on celluloid and is transported to the actual event.Such is the case with this entire film, especially the opening D-Day invasion.  The outstanding acting crew of Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, among others, become real soldiers.  We fight along side them. When people suffer, we cannot help but feel their pain.I think the most striking thing about this film from a technical perspective was the phenomenal cinematographer of Janusz Kaminski.  As he did with 'Schindler's List,' Kaminski achieves a consistent newsreel effect, but this time the camerawork is more frantic, more likely to take us by surprise. Particularly during the D-Day sequence, we are as confused and blind-sided as many of the actual soldiers, and this adds to the intensity.  Beyond Kaminski, everybody involved deserves a standing ovation, or perhaps more fittingly, a salute for making a film this great.I feel like I'm getting hysterical, and I really don't want to.  Suffice it to say that 'Saving Private Ryan' is a phenomenal film capable of extraordinary emotional impact, able to make us week, tremble, and practically scream out with near-agony.  This film conveys the truth about war, and only those who do not fear the truth will be able to watch it.  Of course, a warning is needed.  Few films are as graphically violent as this one, but few have as much of a reason to be.If nothing else I've yet said made any sense, maybe this will.  See 'Saving Private Ryan.'  Or better yet, experience 'Saving Private Ryan.'**** out of ****.",Null,0,0,5 January 2000
Schindler's List," Flawless, moving. A masterpiece.
","Let's set the record straight, once and for all.  I do not like 'Schindler's List.'  I do not enjoy watching it.  If I'd have my choice, I'd never see it again, ever.  But of course, I don't have any choice in the matter, because it's simply too disturbing to never see again.  I don't believe there is any finer monument to the horrors of the Holocaust than Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List.'  People may tell us of the horrors, of the concentration camps, of the deaths, but this film puts us there, among the survivors.This is, of course, Spielberg's crowning achievement.  As far as I am concerned, there is no other film ever made anywhere that has the power and emotion of 'Schindler's List,' least of all the technical expertise that is so evident here.  For instance, Janusz Kaminski's frenetic camera work whips us through the ghettos in such a way that we can not help but be terrified, and yet is calm enough to let us catch a breath, cry a tear.  This is also, in my opinion, John Williams' finest score.  It is so sparse, so beautiful. For any classical music fans, I can only compare this score to Henryk Gorecki's Third Symphony, 'A Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.'  But I'm getting off the topic.The acting is flawless, with performances from the likes of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes.  And, of course Steven Zaillian's moving script that puts us everywhere, from the heart of the horror to the outskirts of it.Let me go back to what I said at the beginning of this review.  I do not like 'Schindler's List.'  I love it.  And yet, I don't love it quite it the way that I love any other film.  What I can do is recommend it without reservation to anybody who has never seen it.  There is no better film than this.  Period.Of special note, Spielberg apparently donated a copy of this film to every American high school.  I can not thank him enough for that, because it was in class that I first saw 'Schindler's List.'  I just pray that others have been as affected by it as I have.**** out of ****.",10,9,13,19 August 1999
Dumb and Dumber," This Is A Dumb Movie. I Loved It!
","First, let me make this abundantly clear.  'Dumb and Dumber' is a movie for guys.  That is, this is a really really bad date movie.  Girls just won't find it funny, in fact, they'll mostly just find it sick and tasteless. That's because it is sick and tasteless.  Then again, so is all really good guy humor.  Another reason not to see it with a girl is that you'll end up feeling guilty for laughing at it, simply because the girl is there.I'm a guy.  Still, I am a bit ashamed to say the honest truth:  I love 'Dumb and Dumber.'  And I don't mean that I kinda-sorta-maybe-a-little-bit liked it.  I thought it was hilarious from start to finish.For starters, it's dumb.  That much is obvious from the title at least. I'll try to get beyond that, even though it isn't easy with a movie like this.'Dumb and Dumber' stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as complete idiots.  I'm not saying this to be mean or politically incorrect, but to be truthful. They're just dumb.  However, I also encourage you to rent 'Gettysburg' and 'The Truman Show.'  Here are the same guys in intelligent roles, and they're still good.  This is the proof of great acting!  The fact that these intelligent men can act like idiots puts both of them on my top ten list of actors.Where do I go from there?  Well, the comedy is typical bathroom comedy, with bodily function jokes, sex jokes, and then more of both of the above.  Is it really funny?  You betcha.So, what am I really saying here?  Just this:  Guys, get a bunch of your guy friends together, get a pizza and a huge bottle of Coke.  Sit around for a while telling dirty jokes and stuffing your face, and then watch 'Dumb and Dumber.'  Be proud of your guy-ness, of your immaturity, of your testosterone!  Here's to guys!P.S.

The Insider," A phenomenal film of awesome social importance.
","Is it really possible to say that an seven-time Oscar-nominated film is under-rated?  I think, with Michael Mann's 'The Insider,' it is very possible.  This is more than a good movie, it's a masterpiece.  In fact, I would say that it is the second-best film of 1999.  In my opinion, this is a superior film to 'American Beauty.'This film has many good things about it, but there are two that really jumped out at me.  The first is a phenomenal, passionate performance by Russell Crowe.  He becomes Wigand, and it is truly not a glorious role.  But it is an honest role, and Crowe plays it honestly.  Wigand is a down-to-earth man, like you or me, but he knows something, and he feels that other people need to know this as well.  This is not intelligence that is driving him, exactly, it is ethics.  I am not saying that Wigand is not intelligent, rather, that anyone who has ever felt the tug of ethics can relate to what he's feeling.  Crowe is one of the boldest actors that we have, and this role is truly a risky one.The second thing that really needs to be praised is the brilliant cinematography of Dante Spinotti.  Great camera work is hard to come by. When a cinematographer takes too many risks, the viewer is disoriented. When not enough risks are taken, the film is boring.  Spinotti gives this film a bizarre visual image that never disorienting, but, somehow (and i can't explain how), helps us see the characters in a very human perspective. That's why I chose to use the work 'brilliant,' because true brilliance is difficult to explain.Like any film, this one is not perfect.  The direction is, at times, too heavy-handed, and we become a little bit aware of the film's length towards the middle (this is perhaps the fault of the writers), but no film of recent years sees a social problem so clearly and deals with it so honestly.**** out of ****.",Null,0,0,25 June 2000
The Graduate," Brilliant, Flawless, and Then Some...
","Obviously, this is a great movie.  The performances are all nothing short of brilliant, the script is a work of art, and the off-centered direction and cinematography make it truly unique.  But let's delve in a bit deeper, and really see what this movie says to us, shall we?'Plastics.'  What does this word mean to you?  Unless you're employed in a field that involves a great deal of plastics, probably not very much.  Or take Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a bright, athletic college graduate who has absolutely no clue where he's going or, for that matter, why he's going there.  What does plastics mean to him?  Nothing.  But, if an opportunity to do something with plastics came up, would he take advantage of it?  I think so, simply because he couldn't think of anything better to do with his time.Which explains the ultimate confusion of Mike Nichols' 'The Graduate'. Why would a guy like Ben every have an affair with someone like Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft)?  Because there wasn't any real glaring reason not to, and because he couldn't think of anything better to do with his time.  Mrs. Robinson simply becomes available, just as Elaine (Katherine Ross) becomes unavailable.  In a world where nothing makes much sense, what seems easiest and most available is, only too often, what we take advantage of.Enter the world of Ben Braddock, where nothing is quite what it seems, and yet everything makes complete sense.  Everyone has, I believe, been in Ben's shoes.  If not, they will be sooner or later.  Confusion and self-doubt are a part of everybody's coming of age, and 'The Graduate' turns these feelings into a bizarre, inexplainable masterpiece.  The empty faces at the end only help to put us in Ben's position all over again.  Where are we going, why are we going there, and where will we go from there?**** out of ****.",10,1,2,7 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," There's Something About 'There's Something About Mary'
","That was really redundant, I know, and I apologize.  But still, it's true. There's something about 'There's Something About Mary.'  Something that really makes me laugh.  The Farrelly Brothers have done it again with this one.  It's unarguably sick, disgusting, and hilarious, and yet, there's a sweet side to it as well.  Not much of one, mind you.  This is still your typical sophomoric gross-out comedy, but it has brains this time around. The script is witty, intelligent, and very well paced, and the technical side of the movie is good without taking anything away from the comedy.  It has this weird appeal to it that can make you love it and hate it at the same time.It also has Cameron Diaz.  There's something about her too.  For starters, she's gorgeous.  On top of that, she can act.  Now, please don't misunderstand me here, because her acting in 'Mary' can appear stupid and poorly-timed almost all of the time, but I think that was intentional.  What it really proves is that, even though she acts like a complete idiot sometimes, there's still just something about her.Let's not forget Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller, who add the conflict and the (forgive me for this one) suspense.  Both play their parts with equal helpings of vim and vigor, and yet, they both act like complete idiots.But all of this is relatively unimportant in the long run.  What really matters is that this is one sick, hilarious movie.  This is bodily function humor, locker room talk at its bawdy best.  I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind looking at things a bit differently, and who isn't offended easily, of course.*** out of ****.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
Titanic," The greatest film ever? I doubt that.
","'Titanic' has made a lot of friends since it first appeared in theaters, and I can't say that it doesn't deserve them.  Certainly, parts of the film are superb, moving, and really unparalleled among other films.  Then, there are those other parts that aren't.  What really bothers me about 'Titanic' is that the weakest elements of the film seem to be those that have garnered the most praise among fans.  Allow me to elaborate.For instance, there are the main characters, provided by Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet.  Besides setting off considerable sparks and possessing a great amount of natural chemistry, they accomplish very little.  Actually, that's not completely true for Winslet, who may very well set the record for showing the most cleavage ever in a PG-13 film.  But as far as characters, they are cardboard cut-outs who, while they look very good on screen, are doing little more than taking up space.Of course, this isn't completely their fault.  Both of these young actors can indeed act, believe me, I've witnessed it for both of them.  The fact is, they didn't have much to work with, and here I am, of course, referring to James Cameron's script.  Now, just to set the record straight, Cameron is a very talented fellow.  He knows how to make a completely convincing fake ship sink, how to stage action scenes, and how to tell a story.  Quite simply, he's a good director.  No, no, he's a great director.  But he's a horrible writer.  His dialogue positively reeks of clichés and vainly-attempted humor.  And, perhaps that explains why James Horner's fantastic score has so much of the limelight.  Perhaps Cameron realized that his pathetic script wasn't enough to build drama and suspense, so he relied on the music to do that.Now, on another level, the film is a technical masterpiece.  The special effects, cinematography, editing, production design, and all of the other 'back-stage' elements are simply superb.  While 'Titanic' unarguably cost an enormous amount of money, it's easy to see why.  The money is right up on the screen, in all its glory, for all to see.  Yet, is it fair to say that a film is great when only half of it truly is?  I don't think so.  On that note, I base my overall rating, knowing that it would have been far better if only Cameron swallowed his pride, put his ego on the shelf for a moment, and hired someone else to write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, he didn't, so we have to suffer for it.*** out of ****.",Null,3,5,5 September 1999
The Truman Show," It defies explanation, yet it wins you over.
","It gives me great pleasure to see people try to explain Peter Weir's 'The Truman Show.'  Even here at IMDB, the genre is listed as Fantasy/Drama/Comedy/Sci-Fi.  And yet, is it really any of these?  Anyone who's seen it will probably agree with me that it is sort of all of these, but not really any.Let me begin by saying that Truman Burbank is my hero.  I can't tell you why, exactly, except that I don't think I'd ever have the courage to do what he did.  If you don't know what he did, see the movie.  Truman is brilliantly played by the often un-brilliant Jim Carrey.  He's a nice guy. We like him.  We like his wife (Laura Linney).  We like his best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich).  In fact, we even sort of like Christof (Ed Harris), the media mastermind who created Truman's world and saw it fall apart. Think of Dr. Frankenstein's famous line:  'I've created a monster!'Every involved in this film should be saluted.  Andrew Niccol's script is flawless, Peter Weir's minimalist direction gives even more energy and charisma to the production, etc, etc, etc.  I could go on forever, but I won't.  Suffice it to say that Truman's journey and discovery is one of the most moving and profound I've ever found in film.

The Matrix," Don't Trust What You See
","'The Matrix' is the kind of movie that really shouldn't be taken too seriously, I think.  Either that, or it's not being taken seriously enough. If you wanted to get all supernatural and philosophical about 'The Matrix,' you could.  I just wouldn't recommend it too much.The movie itself is one of the finest sci-fi/action films I've ever seen, if only because of how much it wracks your mind.  The special effects are simply out of this (and probably any other) world.  Half of the time, you're not quite sure what you're really seeing, and you're not sure if you even want to be, for that matter.  The special effects are so good, in fact, that I can't at the moment think of any other film with any quite as good.  I really don't have a clue as to how any of them were done.  All I am sure of is that the Wachowski Brothers must have had a lot of fun playing tricks on the audience, and they do one heck of a job on it as well.The story itself is great too, and very well acted, particularly by Keanu Reeves (Neo) and Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus).  Their characters are three-dimensional in that they are sci-fi 'heros' with feelings, emotions, and believable personalities.  I say 'feelings' and 'emotions' with caution, because this is surely not a mushy film whatsoever.  This is the type of storyline where everything (eventually) makes sense, where things fall into place without being contrived, and the end result is actually quite believable and convincing.After I stepped out of the theater in which I saw 'The Matrix,' I looked around myself.  The result was similar to 'The Truman Show' in that I suddenly started to wonder what was real.  The feeling passed, of course, and I began to see 'The Matrix' as simply a great sci-fi/action film. Still, that's bad at all, is it?***1/2 out of ****.",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," I almost embarrassed to say how much I loved this movie.
","Beware, oh ye of little senses of humor.  All ye who enter here and still profess to have good taste should leave immediately, lest...  Aw, heck, I don't know.  'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is an exercise is bad taste, bad timing, bad writing, and yet, I love it.  Why, I ask myself, time and time again, why?  Because it's hilarious, you fool, and nothing can stop it from being just that.  Every moment is, I'm convinced, bizarrely brilliant, in a perverted, off-color sort of way.  I see it, and I laugh much too hard for my own good.  There is the great Black Knight scene, of course, which is a masterpiece of bad film, and who could forget the Castle Anthrax, that sick fantasy for every teenaged boy?  And then the ending comes, and one says to oneself, 'That's the precisely wrong thing to happen there!  It's horrible!' And then you realize that that's what the entire film is as well.Do I recommend this film to anybody?  Of course not!  But please, do yourself a favor and see it anyway.*** out of ****.",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
