Lucky Number Slevin," Great Movie and Lucy Liu is Awesome
","This movie is great for several reasons. It has a few tricks in its bag, but its not a one watch wonder. The action, the comedy, and that lock stock style of character coolness makes this movie worth watching over and over again. The movie has lots of star-power which is often bad thing, but this is one of those movies where you feel like the stars were cast very well and they're doing the movie b/c they like it versus to make the big bucks.Also, before this movie, I've never been a particularly big Lucy Liu fan. I've only ever seen her in either serious or corny fighting movies. In this movie, she is intelligent, quirky, cute and ultimately comes across as having a great personality. I personally think this type of role plays to her strengths more so than the other movies I have seen her in. Hopefully, in the future she gets an opportunity to be more than a corny or essentially mute Asian action figure.",10,4,7,31 October 2006
