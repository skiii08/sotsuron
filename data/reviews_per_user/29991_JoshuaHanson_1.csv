Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All in the visuals
","The point of this movie is the visual quality of the film. Critics will tell you that this movie is heavily flawed, and 'hard-core' Star Wars fans will hate Jar-Jar Binks, but this blinds people to what they see on the screen. I see great, stunning visuals in a world that has been ingeniously populated by George Lucas. The flaws still exist, which pull down its rating, but the movie serves its point well in making the movie fun. While some acting might be shaky, some dialogue may not be well-written enough to be up to par for 'Star Wars,' George Lucas always manages to outdo himself with the look of a movie. The Phantom Menace really looks great, and its heart lies with children.",7,0,1,21 May 2005
