Ford v Ferrari," Passion is the ultimate fuel
","LeMans 66' shows just how much this modern age of access has made everythig meaningless, empty and easily discardable. We live in a world of fake news and social media drama influencers, influencing the creatuon of meaningless movie scripts and prequel sequels, while this cinematic gem portrays the good ol' days when things were 'real' and had tangible value.I haven't been this thrilled in cinema since seeing Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time. Damon and Bale portrayed their characters extremely convincing and kept me engaged until the end, strongly cheering for the maverick underdogs fighting competition and corporate pressure.This was based on a true story and in the end, pushing yourself to the extreme is the only way to find out who are you and what you are made of on your path to greatness.",10,2,3,3 December 2019
Us," Horror genre outlook is the real horror here
","This is what Hollywood perceives to be interesting for cinema audiences today: a fairly good introduction of a dark skinned protagonist with an even darker past, which will be used to create a hype trailer material; followed by a poor and underperforming populistic plot twist with plot holes, inferior ideas and anti-climatic ending.I guess this one is on 'Us' who have seen it or 'You' who are considering seeing it, since casting Elisabeth Moss should be a stronger indicator of what this movie is - pure horror.",3,1,2,6 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Spitting fire and taking names!
","This is a wild west history of Hollywood in its former glory during the roaring 60s, with Leo the Kid grabbing viewer attention in 'pillage the village' style. A true treat for the hungry cinematic intellectual, on the hunt for some true style.Our good friend Tarantino did grow up and this is some gourmaine adult humor we are talking about now.",10,19,26,5 September 2019
Joker," Take a city tour in Joker's Taxi
","Make no mistake, this is not a supervillan superhero movie. It's a powerful introspection about all of us sad clowns, dysfunctionally coping with life by putting on a happy face and not being so serious about the things we encounter.Phoenix realistically embodied the descend of a broken man into the darkness of insanity, a deep inner place where all societal norms get reformulated and endless second chances are born. Radical ideas like these can easily be interpreted as grandious avantgarde visions, and mobilize cultish fanatical followers - just as many Jokers thruought our history have demonstrated.Although it is commonly believed that the 'freaks' come out at night when society falls asleep, we should ask ourselves who the real freaks of this world are - just like Travis Bickle did at the end of Taxi Driver.",10,4,7,19 November 2019
Parasite," K-Blockbuster: Cinematic K-Pop
","I came to see this hyped-out title and was expecting to see it flop, only to be amazed by its brilliance and cinematography. Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication.I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography, taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind. Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects, and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation.
This movie portrays a lower-class family, making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world, by skipping into the higher layer of society. Although they have less to show, they are more of a family than their higher-class counterpart, living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together. In a way, it blends and clearly separates these two worlds, similair in essence but completely different in reality.It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall, where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer. Because of this, you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow, or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich.In the end, one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives, taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life's purpose as it pleases?",10,1,5,28 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Maybe being a Nazi was also a horror on its own?
","I don't get the fuss about this movie, seriously people it's 2020. You are watching a political satire. You should expect that some people will be made fun of. I think the ultimate respect for the victims is to consistently make fun of such fascistic dictatorship and point out how such behaviours could have been prevented with more active involvement.I feel the whole analogy of Hitler talking to a child who doesn't understand the strength of such words and actions, perfectly illustrates what Nazis were all about while living the lie of ideology. Characters are convincing and charming and the cinematography is beautiful. I don't think Scarlett Johansson will win an Oscar for this one and Waititi remains consistent to his style portraying the ungrateful role of Adolf Hitler in a decent and entertaining manner. On the other hand, the raw talent of Roman Griffin Davis is out of this world, being able to capture a wide spectrum of emotions at such an early age.Lastly, I think this quote by Thomasin McKenzie outlines the whole idea of the movie and illustrates the lie Nazi Germany was living at that time: 'You're a ten year-old kid, who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club. But you are not one of them.'",8,0,0,5 February 2020
Green Book," A Green Book Enriched with Golden Letters
","I feel this is the first movie in a long time that was worthy of my time and held me engaged from the beginning to the end.It is truly amazing and inspiring to observe what it took to overcome the paradoxical situation of being an underdog regardless of your incredible talent and formal intellectual capacity - just because some traditional societal norms say you are. See how far society truly has progressed over the years and what it takes to make a difference when leading future thought.
Expose yourself to this title and experience a brief Passage of life from the 'good ol' days' with a laugh and a tear, where gender and the color of your skin defined your value, aspirations and the parameters around your dreams. It was a time where intellect was cheap and modern neoliberalism was trailblazing the future, a time of 'simplicity' both in terms of technology and humanitarianism.",10,2,3,24 February 2019
