Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Disappointed!
",After reading the book I wanted to see this story on film. What I got was an audio book with excessive special effects. The movie left out essential details that help molded Abe's character into a vampire hunter in the book. The movie make him look like a fool and the action is so far fetch that it is laughable. The narration in the movie was excessive also. I paid for a movie not an audio book! Yet they kept filling in spot with word not action. This movie was leaned on special effects more than plot and acting so it failed miserably.I had to leave an hour into the movie.*Note to self to stay away from the everyone associated with this production.,1,9,20,23 June 2012
