The Blair Witch Project," No classic, but....
","This film has been both overly praised and overly denigrated. I wasn't scared by it(and I don't exactly possess nerves of steel). In this respect,it doesn't live up to it's hype,(how could it)?,and if this is the sole criteria on which it is judged,it is bound to disappoint many viewers.For myself, a film made on a shoestring, eschewing overt violence, gore, and bloated Hollywood style special effects is a long overdue breath of fresh air. Additionally, I found the story compelling. The way this trio moves from initial camaraderie, to petulant arguing and sniping, and finally to panic and hysteria is finely conveyed.The last few minutes were unsettling rather than frightening, but I can't help but admire the filmmaker's conviction in crediting their audience with some imagination.In short, this is a film that will not please everyone. (Few worthwhile things do). But it should please most patrons who don't check their brains at the door.",6,0,1,22 August 1999
