The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good, but not for everyone.
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 1. So, first i was thinking this movie is going to be something boring because there is no hunger games, but truly, it was pretty fun to watch. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is in District 13 after she shatters the games forever. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss spreads her wings as she fights to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and a nation moved by her courage.Acting in this movie is good. Donald Sutherland as President Snow, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch did their best. A song from a movie that everyone remembers: Hanging tree gives me tingling. Also, this is a good prepare for a next Hunger Games movie, because it's going to get viciously (i read books). What is bed about this movie is that some parts are boring and unnecessary.So, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is not for everyone. I'll recommend it to the ones who watched previous Hunger Games.",7,1,8,6 February 2015
The Maze Runner," Really good start for a new trilogy
","The Maze Runner, a cool sci-fi movie based on a novel by James Dashner, really kicks ass. I'm not going to compare the book and movie, just to be clear. So, everything started after Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) woke up in some old, dark elevator. He was brought to glade which was surrounded by a maze. Then, Thomas joined 'runners' that are exploring maze and trying to find an exit, but, the maze is changing it's structure every night. Walls are rotating and making different maze. After a few days, a super hot chick, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) , was brought in glade as well. All dudes and one chick... Not going to end well. What I really like in this movie is fear of grievers, creepy mechanic monsters that are living in a maze. I like animation of grievers and their sounds as well. Also, i like their assurance that they will never find an exit of a maze, but they are still running through it, they are not giving up. No humor, which is telling us to take a movie more serious. Things that I don't really like is acting. It's OK, but not perfect. Also, I don't like ending. I know, there are two more parts, but the explanation of the maze is not enough explained. That's the only reason why do you have to read a book. So, The Maze Runner is a movie that will entertain you and make you read a whole book trilogy. I am definitely looking forward to the next two or three movies that are going to release in next few years.",8,0,1,3 February 2015
American Sniper," Masterpiece!
","American Sniper is a one brilliant war movie that is going to entertain you so much, that after the movie ends, you'll still think about it. Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was nothing more than a Texan man who wanted to become a cowboy, but in his thirties, he found out that maybe his life needed something different, so he went to army to become a sniper. And he did well. He was called with some nicknames like hero and legend. He became best sniper in American history. The thing that i really appreciate in this movie is that they show his life like a younger guy at the beginning of the movie, and he gets much older and older and then, we came to a first scene of a movie when he is aimng at some kid who is holding a grenade. Also, i like that atmosphere of war. Kids and their moms are fighting for Iraq too. Nothing can stop them. I like that posttraumatic stress disorder after he came back at home when the war ends. Acting, of course, is one of the virtues that this movie can give us. Acting of Kyle Gallner (Goat-Winston) and Keir O'Donnell (Jeff Kyle) is best. What is bad in this movie, well, I can tell you that there is nothing that really bothers me.I'll definitely recommend you this movie, no matter what.",10,13,30,4 February 2015
The Lego Movie," Everything is Awesome!
","And I finally watched it! The Lego Movie!The LEGO Movie is a 3D animated film which follows lead character, Emmet a completely ordinary LEGO mini-figure who is identified as the most 'extraordinary person' and the key to saving the Lego universe. Emmet and his friends go on an epic journey to stop the evil tyrant, Lord BusinessSo, when I was a kid, I was a big fan of legos. I was playing with them all the time. But now, when I saw this movie, I am thinking:' Well, I still have my legos under the bed.'There is a fantastic crew of actors here. We have Will Arnett (Batman voice), Elizabeth Banks (Wyldstyle), Will Forte (Abraham Lincoln), Jonah Hill (Green Lantern), Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius), Dave Franco (Wally) and, of course, Liam Neeson (Bad Cop/Good Cop). And all of them done well. I wasn't expecting this much.Humour in this movie is for everyone. There are jokes that kids can understand, but parents and older crew will laugh as well. There was one joke that really reminds me of 'Two and a half man', and it was, of course, 'Honey,where are my pants?'Also, song 'Everything is awesome' is as well, awesome. It's so catchy that I must share it on facebook. The song is not complicated and it's good rhythm.There is a lot of clichés, but with everything mentioned up here, that's nothing. Some of clichés really reminds me of 'Ice Age' series which were having a lot of clichés as well.So, this movie is really entertaining commercial for legos, but commercial with humor and good acting crew. Definitely recommending it to everyone!",10,0,1,13 April 2015
Inside Out," We already have Oscar Winner for Best Animated Feature Of The Year!
","Pixar is back! And good as always. I'll just say, if you didn't already, go watch this movie!Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.After a lot of time (for me, since Toy Story 3) we got another awesome Pixar movie. The story is really, really good. I can easily say that this movie is for both, parents and children. For parents because it has something that kids won't understand, like growing up and stuff, but kinds will like jokes and funny moments. I was impressed because there are NO FART JOKES! Like in other new animated films, there is some humor that some kids won't understand.The voice actors did great. Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness), Bill Hader (Fear) and Lewis Black (Anger). They were just awesome. There are not many clichÃ©s. Sound effects are good as well. Animations are just great. There is one scene when shelves with memories are falling, and after that I was being like:' In your face, San Andreas!' Trust me, that scene is brutal.Pete Docter did a great job as well (writer and director). He is one of the best director and writer for animated movies. He is like... Awesome. He made Up, Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Wall-e. He is unstoppable!Well, this movie is great, but it has only one sin and, of course, that are clichÃ©s. No movie is without them. I can easily say that we already have Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature Film Of The Year.",10,21,59,22 June 2015
Non-Stop," Pretty good Plane thriller!
","Liam Neeson starring himself (as always)! Yey!Bill Marks, a former cop dealing with his daughter's death by drinking, is now a federal air marshal. While on a flight from New York to London, Marks gets a text telling him that unless 150 million dollars is transferred to an offshore account, someone will die every 20 minutes. Can he find the terrorist in time and save everyone?So, whole story is pretty decent. At first, I wasn't looking forward for this movie, but not when I saw it, I can tell that it's pretty good action/thriller movie. Liam Neeson acts same in every movie. Here he acted same, as well. I don't know, but in every single movie he was acting on, his family is always dying or is already dead (or he is saving someone who have something in common with his family). Also, he never dies. He is playing God in every movie. ALSO, he is always a cop (or ex-cop), but he always saves everyone or get justice for his family. Julianne Moore really surprised me. She is really good actor and in this movie she acted good as well. I wasn't expecting this much acting in this movie, but we get their best.Special effects are well made. Plane crushing on runway is pretty cool. Also, I was enjoying those moments when they hit a ceiling of plane (because gravity or that kind of stuff).Movie is thrilling and interesting, but there are a lot of clichés. I couldn't help myself not to notice them. Also, this movie is pretty predictable, but who is terrorist... no!So, this movie is well made, it's really entertaining and I'm recommending it to everyone!",8,0,1,9 April 2015
The Theory of Everything," While there is life, there is hope!
","The Theory of everything is the most beautiful movie that I was watching in the last few years.The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) , and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) the arts student he fell in love with whilst studying at Cambridge in the 1960s. Little was expected from Stephen Hawking, a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, given just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at 21 years of age. Eddie Redmayne did a good job in this movie, his emotions and attitude of ALS is great. He is fighting through the whole movie against ALS and he is not giving up. After you watched the movie you will feel sorry for him. Stephen and Jane's love is really decent done. Clichés are one of the things that will bother you, but not a a lot.Yes, this review is short, but I have nothing more to tell. This movie is the most beautiful movie that I ever watched.",10,1,2,15 February 2015
Ex Machina," Really good mind-blowing movie!
","This is one of those movies: the more you watch, more it gets f**ked up.Caleb, a 26 year old coder at the world's largest internet company, wins a competition to spend a week at a private mountain retreat belonging to Nathan, the reclusive CEO of the company. But when Caleb arrives at the remote location he finds that he will have to participate in a strange and fascinating experiment in which he must interact with the world's first true artificial intelligence, housed in the body of a beautiful robot girl.So, the story is really, really interesting. It will hold you till the last minute and after the movie, you'll be like:' OK, what the hell just happened?' . When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was searching for the tickets for cinema, but I didn't find it. I don't know, but our cinemas in Croatia didn't show the movie.The acting is great. Domhnall Gleeson (Caleb) and Oscar Isaac (Nathan) did great. Their connection at first was great, but after a while, Ava told Caleb that everything is a lie and after that, their connection and friendship changed. Alicia Vikander as Ava did great as well. She acted just like a robot. When the movie ends, I was being like:'And that's where the Terminator begins.' No, seriously, if you already watched it, you'll know why. At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that this is going to be something messed up. And it really was. At the end, Nathan turned out to be a good, but Caleb's plan screws him up. When I first saw Nathan's wardrobe, where manikins are, I was like:'Whaaa...?'Visuals and Sound effects are awesome. Sounds that Ava makes every time she moves is awesome. Soundtracks were good as well. Everything went so smooth through the movie. At the end, I'll say, definitely go watch this movie!",10,1,4,24 May 2015
The Imitation Game," Are you paying attention? You should.
","The Imitation Game is really, really good made biography directed by Morten Tyldum. At the beginning of the movie, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) sad: 'are you paying attention', but you should, because this movie definitely deserves it.During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians. That's actually all what you have to know before you watch movie. Acting of Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley that is acting his assistant is really good. B. Cumberbatch perfect fits in his role of Turing, who reminds me of Sheldon Cooper. His way of connection with his partners that are helping him crack enigma is insanely weird (again, Sheldon Cooper). War is well shown with some short scenes of people surviving on subway station or in a basement. Also, the ending is really good made, but i'm not going to spoil you anything. For audio editing and music in movie job is well done. Turing's life is shown in some short scenes that are some kind necessary for storyline to move smooth through the movie .This movie is great and I'm recommending it for everyone. This movie deserves those Oscars!",10,3,9,7 February 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Awesome!
","How I define Avengers: Expendables with Marvel superheros, but much more badass.When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth's Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for a global adventure.The story is, for me better than first one. I don't know, but the first one was a little bit boring, but this one is much more interesting. The actors are great (as always). Old crew is here again: Robert Downey Jr (Iron man)., Chris Hemsworth (Thor) , Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) , Chris Evans (Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye). So, Robert Downey Jr. was my favorite, as always. He is sarcastic and witty as always. All other avengers did great as well. Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) in the middle of the movie, just when you start thinking:'Where the hell is he?'. Then, surprise surprise, her he is.The special (Visual) effects are great. I was feeling like I'm watching hero movie (what I was watching), some crazy apocalypse movie and comedy (because of Downey Jr. and others but mostly because of him). Every single effect was shocking. I was looking into the movie like I saw a ghost (not scared, more like surprised). The avengers are badass more than in the first movie. The action scenes are great and also, entertaining as hell. Soundtracks in this movie are well made.So, after all, this movie is really good. I was fully entertained, but I won't recommend this movie to people that don't like hero movie.",10,6,16,26 April 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great movie, worth watching!
","So, Birdman by Alejandro G. Iñárritu can't be explained in few words. It is a new masterpiece that is nominated for 9 Oscars! Damn!Anyway, actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is most famous for his movie role from over twenty years ago of the comic book superhero Birdman in the blockbuster movie of the same name. His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than 'Riggan Thomson' the actor.Movie has been adding some of black humor which is really good mixed with some drama. Riggan is one of the characters in which anger you will feel unpleasantly by watching a movie. He is showed like a really nervous and insensitive (I felt him like that). Some great acting we are getting from Emma Stone too. She is acting Riggan's daughter, which was going on a drug withdrawal. For some reasons, some of the parts of the movie were boring.So, Birdman was really a entertaining movie and I hope you will like it too.",9,2,10,4 February 2015
The Water Diviner," Beautiful movie!
","When you see Russell Crowe act in his own movie, well, that combination is unstoppable!After the Battle of Gallipoli, in 1919, an Australian farmer, Connor (Russell Crowe), travels to Turkey to find his 3 missing sons. While staying at a hotel in Istanbul, he meets Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), the hotel manager. And tries to find a way to Gallipoli.Whatever you thought after you watched trailer, you are WRONG! This movie gives us everything: Action, drama, a bit of romance, good dialogs, NO Clichés, good acting etc., you have a perfect movie.Acting in this movie is great. Russell Crowe did his best, not only in directing, in acting as well. His hope that one day he will find his three sons is really good shown. Other actors, for example Olga Kurylenko and Jai Courtney, didn't do bad too.There are not much special effects , but when they are, they are done will. For example, shooting out of cannon is done well. War scenes are done well too. I wasn't expecting that much from this movie.Soundtracks fits in every scene. That sad atmosphere is good made with those soundtracks.At the end, I am recommending this movie to everyone who like war movies.",10,8,19,26 March 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," So bad!
","I was waiting for this movie to come just to write a review.When Anastasia Steele, a literature student, goes to interview the wealthy Christian Grey as a favor to her roommate Kate Kavanagh, she encounters a beautiful, brilliant and intimidating man. The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything.After this 'short' storyline, I must say, this movie is worst movie I saw in my entire life. OK, when you saw a trailer, you thought that this movie is going to be something like porn. Of course, it's not. In this movie sex is dispute thing. I was waiting for something interesting to happen, but after some time you'll give up. But I didn't . I was waiting and waiting, and nothing. Movie dialogs are full of bad acting and clichés. You would expect that actors like Dakota Johnson would act so bad (I mean, that bad). Clichés in this movies are constant and irritating.Soundtrucks are good, but with everything bad in this movie, that's not enough for 2/10",1,2,6,21 March 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," So good!
","When I first watched a trailer for this movie, I wasn't expecting this much from it. I was thinking that it's going to be something like James Bond or like that, but we get a lot more then that.Based upon the acclaimed comic book and directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.So, the story is, by it self, a lot more then usual spy and agent movies. I really like this idea about those sim cards for controlling people.In this movie, there is a lot of good acting. We have Colin Firth (Harry Hart / Galahad), Mark Hamill (Professor Arnold), Samuel L. Jackson (Valentine) and, of course, Taron Egerton (Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin). All of them did great.This movie is also funny, I'm not going to tell you the jokes because i'll spoil you fun then.The action scenes are done well. All of those slow motion scenes are done great and they are in perfect timing. Idea with umbrellas that are multipractic (gun, shield, stunner etc.) is great. In every scene there is something new which, of course, I really like.This movie has a big potential for sequels but, I don't know how the director and writers are going to use that potential. For this movie, when I read some reviews, I was so exciting and finally, I watched it. It was worth waiting. From now on, this is one of my favorite movies.",10,2,9,2 April 2015
Minions," Funny, but that's not it!
","So, this movie disappointed me a bit, but not that much.Minions Stuart, Kevin and Bob went on a journey to find a super-villain, which will they serve. On their journey, they went to VillainCon (I think it was called like that) and they started to serve one of the best villains in the world (America), Scarlet Overkill. They helped her to steal a crown. This movie is not that good as Despicable Me, but it's better than Despicable Me 2. In the first one, minions are funnier than in this one called Minions, which is a shame. Of course, this movie is funny, but there are some jokes that are here for the kids. The movie's ending is great. After I saw young Gru and when his theme song started playing, I was being like:'OK, I think this is one of the most awesome movie (animated) I ever saw.' The funniest joke in this movie is when minions came to the VillainCon (again, don't know if it's called like that), and Scarlet came at a stage with her awesome dress, dude dressed like her screamed:'I love you, Scarlet!' I mean, that was hilarious. Also, I really liked that moment when Scarlet told minions a 'bed-time story' (which was cruel), Bob fell asleep. Characters (Bob, Stuart and Kevin) are done well in this movie. They have a lot of chemistry together. They are always all together and they are different. Kevin is brave and he is a chief. Bob is like a child. He is playful and scared. And Stuart, nahh... He is just hungry.At the end, this was a really short review, but I have nothing else to say. I mean, jokes were mostly funny, characters have a good chemistry, ending is badass and... That's it. This movie is not that good as I was thinking it'll be, but it was good.",7,10,18,29 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely day! And movie!
","I don't know why people are complaining about this movie. All of them are saying that this movie is disappointing, but I was actually impressed! Seriously, who wrote this movie.An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.What I like about this movie is an originality. Once again, some crazy people wrote this movie. Just look at some scenes, some characters. Seriously, where the hell did they found that dude that looks like a baby and is fed with baby milk.Also, some people are complaining about Tom Hardy starring Max. I was really happy with it. No, I'm impressed again. I really like his hallucinations of his past. Charlize Theron starring Furiosa did crazy as well. Her hope for better tomorrow was done well. These mothers are done good as well.I also really like visual effects. That effect of sandstorm is amazing. Seriously, my jaw drops after sometime. Sound effects and soundtracks are done good as well. I really like that dude that is playing some crazy looking guitar at the front of the car. There is not much dialog, which I really like. This movie is concentrates on action, not on the story telling (also well made). When I first saw the trailer, I was like:'Another Mad Max movie? But I didn't watched the first trilogy.' But what I really like is that this movie is not connected with other Mad Max movies (you don't have to watch other movies). I think I watched the third Mad Max movie, but I didn't like it much. You know, cars and stuff (not a fan of race movies or games).The action scenes are awesome. I was creeping out while watching those scenes (I don't know why, but I was). I really like their spear with a bomb on the top. Don't know where that came from.At the end, I think this movie is the best movie released this year (sharing first place with Kingsman: The Secret Service). I have to say, if you already didn't, go watch this movie!",10,5,11,20 May 2015
Furious 7," Better than other Furious movies!
","So, this is the third fast and furious movie I every watched, so I don't know much about F&F series.Dominic Torretto and his crew thought they left the criminal mercenary life behind. They defeated an international terrorist named Owen Shaw and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde, and a shady government official called 'Mr. Nobody' are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called God's Eye, that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between terrorist and the United States government.So, if you didn't watch previous Furious movies, you can still watch Furious 7 because the story is not that connected. I watched the first Furious movie and Tokyo Drift and now this. The characters are still the same: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) etc. All of them did good. I'm not going to say great because the movie is filled with clichés and stuff. Like JeremyJahns sad, you can play a drinking game where every time Diesel says word familly' you take a shot. Trust me, don't do it, you'll die.The action scenes are great because this movie is all about action and race. They are exciting, fast and furious (of course). Car races are done good as well.Soundtracks are done well. Everything fit.So, Furious 7 is really good movie, not better than Kingsman, but better than Taken. I was fully entertained and I think this movie deserves a good rating.",9,1,5,5 April 2015
