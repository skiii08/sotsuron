Deja Vu," Action, tension and romance
","From director Tony Scott, the one who brought us Man on fire, we have another movie called Deja Vu. The title itself gives us a clue about what's going on. A ATF detective(Denzel)is called upon to investigate a ship bombing that is later revealed to be connected to the murder of a woman named Claire. During his investigation he is recruited in a special division of the FBI. The movie basically focuses on the relation between Doug(Denzel) and Claire, the dead woman while he tries to identify the culprit. (SPOILER)The scene where he goes to the screen and sees her in her everyday routine and he almost wishes he could touch her is just amazing.(/SPOILER). The movie also deals with time and space distortion, but it has some plot gaps, gaps which will be easily overcome. But the main ingredient is the tension, which builds up an releases and so on. This is also done with the help of the fast camera moves and the same image editing used in man on fire(they are brilliant). It's a shame it didn't get a nod for the superb imagery. So there you have it- brilliant acting by Denzel, action and tension, quality image and that superb touch of romance would give it a 9, but the plot holes only earn it a 8.",8,0,1,1 February 2007
