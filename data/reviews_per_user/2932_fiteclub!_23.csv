The Blair Witch Project," Falling....Falling.....
","Remember when Blair debuted on IMDb 250 near 60?  Now it's near 170 and sinking fast.  Why?  Because people realized it's only 80 minutes of 'YOU LOST THE F*CKING MAP?  THAT'S SO NOT F*CKING COOL!!!  WHAT THE F*CK! SOMEONE F*CKING HELP US WE'RE F*CKING DYING!  SH*T!'  And this coming from the only one in the theater that DIDN'T mind the constant barrage of Heather screaming 'F*CK!'  It wasn't that half of her vocabulary began with that word so much that is was Heather kept screaming it from the top of her vocal cords every five seconds.  'MY SOCKS ARE WET???  F*CKING F*CK!'  'THAT LEAF IS TORN!  F*CKING SH*T!'  My eardrums are still bleeding.  It is kinda fun watching the three actors freak out, though, and no one was dissappointed with the ending.  Even though the movie was three actors over-exaggerating, the ending left everyone on the edge of their seat.  See it-if not for Heather's larynx, or the painted walls in the house, then for the Blair witch herself.",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
Meet the Parents," Awful, Awful
","This film is an uneven mess.  It is funny for about 10-15 minutes at the beginning, and for maybe 45 seconds (possibly two minutes) at the end.  The rest of the film is a horrible monstrosity.After the initial, fifteen minutes (I'll be generous), the film suddenly falls in love with its gross-out comedy.  It began as a kinda strange, funny film about characters.  There's unspoken tension between Stiller and DeNiro, and it was very funny.  Then the film becomes a slapstick gross out mess of a film, and the jokes were seen miles away.  The tragedy is that even when they're being set up we already know they will not be funny, so when they are finally delivered, we completely hate them.At around the midpoint, you find the film too absurd to be taken seriously, and from there it only gets worse.  The characters are so uneven and poorly written that you don't even really care what they say or do. 
Things get more and more absurd and less and less funny as the film goes on and on (and on and on). Clueless Director Jay Roach clearly had a vision for this film, but it's a shame his crew didn't share the same vision.  It's obvious that no one knew what the hell they were doing in this atrocity besides the director.  And it's the irony of ironies that this happens to be one of the worst American directors working today.
This film is much, much worse than those Austin Powers films Roach directed, and I think that's saying quite a lot. In fact-
Wait, wait, what the hell am I doing writing this review?  Why am I still typing?  This film is awful-stay away!  It doesn't even deserve my time in writing a decent review.  If they didn't put that much effort into their film, why should I put that much effort into this?",1,18,35,9 October 2000
Se7en," You will never forget this movie
","Never have I met someone who has seen this movie and upon hearing it mentioned go 'Oh Seven.  I think I may remember that one.'  No one forgets SE7EN.  It stays with you forever, whether you consider that good or bad, it stays.  Every time you see a movie with a shock, or a movie with a bizarre feel and ending, you will think of this.  I have seen thousands of films, most of them twice.  This is the best one I have ever seen.  That's all I can say about it.",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
Fight Club," My mind is still blows
","The general complaint about Fight Club is how the plot twist, which to some was genius but to others pointless, lead to a banal ending.  I disagree. Like Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects, when a movie is so good or so excellent that anything else would be a let down, Fight Club uses a twist that really doesn't have to do much with the movie.  Yes, it does put things into a new and limited perspective, but it is still a great surprise and a wonderful jolt for the audience.  I found that the last scene of the movie could have been developed more realistically, and I am actually disappointed in Fincher for once for blowing the chance to make one of the most ironic endings in film history.Fight Club is a 2 and a half hour comedy.  You will find yourself laughing more at the satire of this film then for it's action subplot.  Like The Matrix and Run Lola Run, Fight Club is a new breed of movie meant to blow your mind and trigger ALL your senses for as long as a movie can possibly do.  To the cynical eye, The Matrix, Run Lola Run, and Fight Club all had their disappointing moments, but to the faithful filmgoer, Fight Club is a treat not soon forgotten.",10,0,1,15 October 1999
Fight Club," certainly not bloodsport
","I had been anticipating fight club for a long time when i heard some people talking about it at my high school.  i wanted to hear what the buzz was and was shocked when people were calling it 'gay' and said that 'it looks really stupid'.  after viewing this preview again, i realized that too many people were viewing this as a stupid van damme bloodsport or one of those cliched chuck norris movies.  fight club is actually a blistering social satire as well as a technical masterpiece bordering both thriller and drama that often leaves you shocked.  if more people took the time to see what this film really is, it could surely be one of the word-of-mouth phenoms of the year.",10,0,1,19 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," I wonder how much it cost the Weinstein's to buy the Best Picture award.
","THIS beat Saving Private Ryan?  Private Ryan-the film that made us appreciate our veterans and understand why our parents wouldn't talk about 'it' all these years-is not as good as Shakespeare In Love?  Neither dramatic nor very funny, Shakespeare in Love makes a mockery of history and Gwenyth Paltrow gives a performance worthy of abhorring as Viola De Lesseps. The minute she comes on screen, you sense the phoniness of the performance, and by the end of the movie you realize this vexatious twit has done basically nothing to inspire Shakespeare besides f**king him every once and a while.  Oh yes, let me run out and write the best play every to grace the page cuz i just got laid.  Nope, don't think so.  When it comes down to it, Shakespeare in Love is really a movie hinging on one big premise with nothing to back it up, and it wears out fast.  With only a handful of good one-liners and performances from both Rush, Paltrow, Affleck, and Firth that all quickly wear out their welcome, I don't see how anyone could find this poorly assembled piece of celluloid better than the massive and heart-wrenching epic Saving Private Ryan.  Ask anyone of those Shakespeare in Love 'fans' out there why Judi Dench won Best Supporting Actress.  Watch them not be able to answer it.  She's on screen for 8 minutes at most, and half the time the audience is supposed to just sit and marvel in her wonderful makeup and costumes.  Do you want to know the number one reason why Shakespeare in Love was a bad movie?  It was written by the guy who did Cutthroat Island.  The other writer was the guy who wrote Brazil.  Brazil was a great movie mind you, but it was a movie without a point; a psychological rush.  If you cross a science fiction acid trip of a movie and a film where Geena Davis plays a pirate, do you really think you're going to get an Oscar-worthy epic picture?  Skip this travesty of a film and move elsewhere...this film doesn't deserve to be called a drama OR a comedy, let alone Best Picture.  I hope all have lost faith in the Academy.",Null,0,1,25 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," F**K OFF SUBTLETY!
","I was astonished at the reviews south park was getting.  Many critics called it 'absolutely hilarious' or 'a f**king funny film'.  I was astonished when a large number of critics called it the funniest movie of the year. Election, a hilariously subtle masterpiece, had been released the past month, and received tremendous praise.  I saw South Park knowing exactly what I was in for.  I thought it had the potential to be funny, but could never live up to Election.  I knew it would ignore all indirect  and sophisticated humor, and I knew it would be composed of 99% toilet humor.  I was right.  I loved it. Leaving the theater I honestly DID find it the funniest movie of the year, and immediately recommended it to all my friends.  Many stay away because South Park is likely to offend.  That's the point.  The swearing and cussing is not thrown in for 'culture' like in Good Will Hunting, but the cussing actually COMPOSES the plot.  If you haven't seen South Park yet, you have no idea what you're missing.",Null,0,0,24 September 1999
Ed Wood," best comedy film ever
","This is, by far, the funniest, wittiest, and most sly film ever made.  It is genius, and no comedy will ever compare to it.  Earlier this year I saw Election and was reminded of this film, for both comedies go beyond your typical comic cliches and make you laugh at things that normally wouldn't be very funny.  I would go so far as to say that Ed Wood is the best movie of the 90's.  I tend to resist when saying that however, because when I say that, my mind thinks of Schindler's List, which I also hold with much regard.  I don't think either is better than the other.  But I will go so far as to say that Ed Wood is the best black and white movie of the 90's. Oh, wait.....",10,0,0,31 January 2000
The Beach," Picks up
","What starts out as a very good beginning slows down but nevertheless remains a satisfying first act.  The movie takes a turn for the worst, however, with a very hollow and pointless second act, where nothing important, if anything at all, happens.  But Danny Boyle and the Trainspotting crew are no fools. They don't let a film suck without doing something about it!  The third act takes off and does its best to revive the sagging film, and you can't help but love Dicaprio's, uh, bonding time with nature.  A very uneven film but all around an enjoyable two hours.possible spoiler: My one gripe: the film suffers from the LA Confidential syndrome.  There is a perfect semi-tragic and real place to end the film, but it was abandoned so the audience would not feel 'isolated'.  We're not all conformists.  We don't need to hear some Lilith Fair song about love and peace come on after a bunch of people got shot and killed.  We don't need 'happily ever after'.  We're big boys.  I can understand that the filmmakers knew their target audience was young, so they wanted to have a nice ending with Leo smiling.  Well I'm fifteen and I'm one of those people who saw Titanic 14 times with my girlfriend.  I may be young, but I'm not stupid. I know when I'm being spoon-fed, and well, in a film that dives into the furthest depths of human insanity, I don't need to see Leo grinning over a crappy iMAC at an internet bar so we can all feel good about ourselves at the end of the day.",10,0,1,18 February 2000
Fargo," So many jokes wasted in Armaggedon....Sigh...
","(minor setting spoiler)With the re-teaming of Buscemi and Stormare in Armaggedon, I was hoping for an inside joke or two tying to Fargo.  Alas, there were none.  But back to Fargo itself now.  One of those movies that critics loved but audiences didn't.  All those comments up there of people that said they loved it, they're just jumping on the bandwagon.  They want to be kewl and/or popular. I like Fargo, now, too, but it took practice.  I originally saw Fargo at my local videostore for halfprice.  I liked the acting in the movie, but didn't really see that much substance in it.  But it came with that snowglobe.  I don't know if you've seen it, but it's cool.  Suddenly I had to have it.  So I bought it, stored the movie somewhere, forgot about it.  Then my friends came-a-callin'.  They wanted to see it.  So I pulled it out, dusted it off, watched it.  Then some other friends wanted to see it, and I watched it again.  And so on and so on until I realized....I kinda actually maybe sorta liked it....It hurt me, but I had to admit, Fargo was geek chic.  Everyone is so corny and old fashioned and dull, and I realized that's what makes them so cool.  I too, am addicted to Fargo.  SIDENOTE:  This drives me crazy.  If the action, the important, uh, thing, takes place in Brainerd ('Babe The Big Blue Ox!'), then why is it called Fargo???",Null,0,2,18 September 1999
American Beauty," Not Worth a 9.3
","This is an expertly filmed, acted, and directed film, but the script is lacking.  Why?  Because the movie is a complex tale about a group of people living in suburbia.  A simple setting is ideal for showing the deep underlyings of society, but we should care about the characters.  All the characters in this movie are freaks.  They're violent or mean, and you really don't care for any of them.  You don't feel sympathy, and half the time you're afraid one of them is going to just flip out and kill everyone. The movie is too graphic for it's own good.  The violence and non-stop sex related material are enough to get the point across without the excessive drug use as well.  This movie has tremendous performances and the best filming you are likely to ever see, but don't expect a nice movie to see a Sunday afternoon.  Instead, plan to see a disturbing and brutal look into the lives of a bunch of basically horrible people.",1,9,23,10 October 1999
American Beauty," Finally
","I was greatly troubled this past week when thinking back over the movies so far this year.  I knew none of my favorite films would get any kind of quality Academy recognition, like Director, Picture, or any of the acting categories.  My four favorite films, The Matrix, Go, South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, and The Sixth Sense, are sure to be virtually shunned of Oscars except for the possible script nomination for either Go or Sixth Sense, and the virtual lock on special effects for The Matrix.  No one can really explain why these films won't get awards and nominations, except 'they're not typical Academy material.'  What is Academy material?  American actors speaking in awful British accents while wearing overly exotic clothing.  Maybe the Academy SHOULD make these types of films 'typical Academy material', because judging by the fact that all four are on IMDb top 250, the general population feels this way as well.  My fifth nominee, which will most likely be Dogma (based on the script), will almost invariably be dismissed from award consideration.  I figured the Academy would give the movie to some god-awful and pointless art film that no one liked anyway, and everyone would be disappointed, like last year.  Then came American Beauty. This film....is spectacular.  There is nothing to compare it to.  A black comedy that succeeds where Happiness and The Ice Storm failed, American Beauty is a tremendous film that may be enough of an Academy film to snag an Oscar, or two or three, or even, say, half a dozen.  It doesn't have any snazzy costumes or whizzing bullets or superb cinematography, but it does have a solid script.  It does have excellent directing.  It does have the performance of a lifetime from Spacey.  I think I'd be satisfied, though, if this took away only Best Picture.  That's really all it needs, because that's the whole point of American Beauty.  It's not an epic, or heart-wrenching drama, it's a film that asks you to.....look closer.",1,3,10,27 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Tears down walls
","This film breaks down any and all remaining barriers of film.  Why?  Not necessarily because it's a good movie, it's only average, but because it's so original.  Ten years ago, this would have never been made.  Five years ago, same thing.  Today, though, in our ever-changing film world, if you want to make a portal into John Malkovich's brain, who's stopping you? This film enables a new era of creativity in cinema.  Whatever you want to do, you can!  And people will see it!  'Malkovich' is pulling in rave reviews and great box office for a small film such as itself.  Get ready for many more to come.",9,0,1,24 November 1999
American History X," Edward Norton
","This film has one of the best performances ever with Edward Norton portraying Derek Vinyard.  It's a shame he didn't get Best Actor.  Eddie Furlong also shows how much he's matured since T2, tackling the very difficult role of the younger Vinyard brother.  My problem with the film, though, is that the ending didn't really hing on the plot of the movie. What happened happened partly because of the nature of the characters and their feelings, but really occured more because of a seperate incident that really didn't have to do much with the general message of the movie.  I'm doing my best here to explain my feelings without ruining the movie, but I don't think I'm doing very well in my reasoning.  Maybe you know what I'm talking about, maybe you don't, but in my opinion, the ending was set in the wrong place.  I didn't think it had much, if anything to do with the point of the movie and the basic plot of a movie, but a mere incident, a sidenote even, that occured earlier.  Just my opinion, though.",Null,0,0,25 September 1999
The Usual Suspects," it is kinda obvious
","(it's impossible to write a usual suspects article without giving away spoilers...or making readers paranoid)This movie, it's Noir that actually makes you feel good; thereby defeating the whole purpose.  You're actually glad what happens happens at the end, even though it's 'supposed' to be bad.  The ending, it shocked some people, but if you look closer, oh yeah, it's obvious.  You can point out exact instances where you say to yourself 'I was either high or dead when I missed that clue.'",Null,0,1,18 September 1999
JFK," Back, and to the left....
","Back, and to the left.  Back.....and to the left.  Three hours of film and this is the only thing I can recall.  To me, JFK was just 150 script pages of Oliver Stone's paranoia and bizarre ideas.  It seemed more suitable for a fanatic's webpage dedicated to his findings and beliefs, not a huge motion picture than someone against all laws of the universe snagged a Best Picture nod. (really sorry about last run on sentence) My head got so swamped with all this craziness, that I began to wonder what I was actually seeing.  Some people have called this movie boring, and for most skeptics, it IS boring. Those X-Philes and Anti-Government will probably love this, but the average working class schmoe has no patience for THREE HOURS of what I thought to be nonsense.  It had little or no basis in reality, and I think the only thing I really understood was Back, and to the left.....",6,3,15,26 September 1999
The Game," David Fincher is a GOD
","I cannot say enough good things about this film or David Fincher's other masterpiece Se7en.  What I find so appealing is how unconventional his film making is.  It's never predictable and never obvious.  Just when you think you've figured it out, he tells you that you're wrong.  I know many of will never forgive Fincher after Alien 3, but the movie wasn't as bad as anyone says.  It didn't live up to Aliens, but what could?  Alien and Aliens are two of the best science fiction movies ever, anything else could barely compare.  Also, Alien 3 started shooting without a script.  Any good director knows you have to have a solid script before you start something like this, but Fincher had just entered the movie business from the land of music videos and took whatever job he could get.  Wouldn't you?  He then proceeded to turn Alien 3 into the film the nobody could stop talking about, with a finale that people still have a hard time believing.  And that's what he's all about-endings.  The Game was a truly under appreciated masterpiece that got trampled, in part, because it got released in late August-early September and anyone in the movie business knows that release date is just hell.  Right after the massive summer and right before the fall Oscar blitz, The Game got trampeled and too many people missed it.  It's quite unfortunate, really.  I suggest you go and rent it, and tell your friends about this.  It deserves more appreciation than it received.",10,0,1,3 October 1999
For Love of the Game," For Love Of Cliche
","I just realized, upon leaving the theater, that Costner hasn't made a good movie since he won his Oscar.  That strikes me as funny, because everyone knows how much control he has over his movies now.  He acts as the director even when he's not, and he controls everything.  The weird thing is though, ever since he won BEST director in 1990-91, his movies have become basically trash.  It's like he's TRYING to fill his movies with as many cliches or as much bad dialogue as possible.  This is obviously no exception.  Until Costner learns to back down, his movie will continue to, well, suck.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
Toy Story 2," Quite Good, But Quite Light
","This movie, however charming it may be, will always be second to the first Toy Story.  Though I loved Toy Story 2 and I have not heard of one bad review concerning it, looking back now, I can't really picture it as clearly as other movies I had seen.  I mere three hours after seeing the movie, I had trouble recalling the great dialogue or interesting situations.  Sure, I could remember the important scenes and all the characters, but what does that matter?  I remembered all the characters and scenes from Baby Geniuses, and that is most definitely, the worst movie of the past five years.  I am quite perturbed that people would say that Toy Story 2 is better than its predecessor.  Nothing will ever match the originality of the fairy tale that captivated adults and kids alike.  SIDENOTE: You know this reviewhas merit when I praise both Toy Story films, for I am the target audience not even considered when marketing Toy Story 2- the teenagers.  It took a lot of struggling to drag my 15 and 16 year old friends to see this movie, but they know as well as I do that that was the best movie any of us had seen since, well, the first Toy Story.",Null,0,0,12 December 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," What are you talking about 'ain't original'?
","Because it features a slew of sharp-tongued characters with a complex plot and a retro soundtrack, suddenly Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels is a rip-off?  It's a hilariously original comedy with hordes of interesting characters to examine, interpret, and guess the outcomes of.  It is modern and has it's fare share of violence, yes, but that doesn't mean it's carbon-copy Tarantino.  Tarantino is all style.  He's there to be cool and slick, let the audience on a ride.  Guy Ritchie is about making people laugh while keeping them interested.  There's action to keep your eyes open and your mind out of the gutter, but it backplays that with a witty comment at the end.  I know some people don't find a dozen people getting shot funny, no matter how awkward or Euripidean the situation is.  I understand that, and so do the filmmakers.  This is not a movie for all people.  It's a movie for people who like things fast paced.  Whether it be dialogue, action, comedy, or visual style, it all comes at you like a bullet in this non-stop film.  I don't find Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels 'Tarantino-esque', but more of a new 'modern' brand of films, such as Run Lola Run and Go. Rent this.  You'll see what I'm talking about.",10,0,0,28 September 1999
Die Hard," Surprisingly, the best screenplay of 1988
","This film is surprisingly incredible.  It is one of the best, if not the best, film of 1988.  The script is filled with many clever things and amazing action scenes.  It is, still today, the best action film ever.

The Matrix," Cool even in French.
","It boils down to this:  this movie is COOL!  You feel like a little kid watching this movie, watching your favorite comic book come to life.  With whizzing sound effects and rapid action, kids to adults were entranced by this epic that somehow managed to come in under the radar.  Some people cite it as a guy flick, but I have seen this with a number of females, and they liked it just as much as me.  Some people complain that it's too confusing. Fine, so be it.  I'm sure my 7 year old brother didn't understand it, yet he loved it.  Why?  Because you can just sit back and let the movie take you in.  The dialogue and graphics and general feel.  You just wanna go. 'Whoa.'",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
Gladiator," Hopefully this will bring about a change
","Let's not kid ourselves, Gladiator is not Braveheart.  Or Saving Private Ryan.  Or any Kurasowa.  It's a blockbuster, a summer film, a crowdpleaser. Usually films like that that put money before quality don't turn out to be very good.  Gladiator SHOULD have been one of these films....a loud, pointless, 200 million dollar grossing flick, but strangely and surprisingly,  it really isn't.  The superb visuals and sets are topped only by the powerful acting from Crowe and the underappreciated Phoenix, as well as the skillful directing of still capable Scott.Make sure you see Gladiator.  Whether you're a summer blockbuster addict or one of those people who only see powerful, trenchant, great films, you should see Gladiator.Let's hope that future summer action flicks turn out like Gladiator.",Null,0,0,27 May 2000
