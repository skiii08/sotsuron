The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Read the Book
","In the reviews I keep seeing people saying that this movie was slow pace. While that is true it needed to be. If any of you have read the book you would know that everything that happened in part one had to be there to understand part two. Part one is building up to all the action in Part two but, in order to get the full effect of part two we had to have the slow paced movie. So don't think because this movie wasn't as up to par as the other ones that part two wont be amazing because that's where all the action is suppose to be.Me personally I loved the movie I thought It was just as good as the others.",8,1,8,24 February 2015
