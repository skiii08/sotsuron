Hereditary," Atmospherically Creepy
","This is an Atmospherically creepy film. Excellent performances. Nice character study. Love the dollhouse/miniature art aspect. However, as the movie progresses the plot really falls apart until there is nothing left but a mess.",6,1,2,19 January 2019
Ready Player One," Sexism, homophobia, and racism have survived the 'corn-syrup shortage' and the ' bandwidth riots'... oh joy.
","I'm not one of those reviewers that loved the book. I found the book mildly entertaining but was overall unimpressed. I thought maybe seeing the book come alive on the screen would serve the story better but the story was only sort of present in the film. The basic frame is there but the soul is gone. Really though, Ready Player One is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory only with video games, virtual reality, and not nearly as good. Unlike Charlie and the Choclate Factory there is no wicked humor and no Gene Wilder. There were enough 80s and 90s references to be mildly entertaining but after awhile the whole thing becomes a bit of a mess - too much CGI and too much mindless action. I also had hopes that they would fix the rampant sexism, homophobia, and racism in the book when they made the film only to discover that all the things that made Aech, Art3mis, Shoto, and Daito remotely cool in the book are either gone or greatly watered down - what a shock. So... if you want to see mind numbing testosterone fueled action where sexism, homophobia, and racism have survived the 'corn-syrup shortage' and the ' bandwidth riots' then this movie is for you!",3,0,5,16 July 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Loved the Book, Loved the Movie
","The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is one of my favorite books. When I worked at a public library, I would often recommend it in response to the 'I want something good, what do you suggest?' question. Especially if the person had been in a reading slump. Because, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a dependably engaging read full of charming characters and genuine heart. The movie is not the book to the last detail but it does manage to capture the heart, warmth, courage, and spirit of the story. I am quite pleased with the adaptation.",10,4,8,11 August 2018
