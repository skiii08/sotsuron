The Avengers," Fantastic!
","Hi ReadersI would recommend to stop wasting your time here reading this review and buy this movie right away. I could not catch the movie when it was in the cinemas and honestly I regret it. The movie is not only superb but is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It will not be wrong if people call it the best super hero movie of the recent time. Featuring all the marvel comic heroes, this one is a marvel in itself!Captain America and Stark (Iron Man) look amazing in their suits while Hulk is much more balanced and Thor is his usual self. Although the Archer guy (I still don't know his name :( ) was new to me and I have not seen him before in any movie but loved his character.Overall, a great entertainer which you cannot afford to miss!",10,1,6,3 February 2013
