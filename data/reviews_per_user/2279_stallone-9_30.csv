Scarface," You *peep* with me,you *peeping* with the best!!!
","Ohhhhhhhhhh man Al Pacino has never played such a cool character except for Michael Corleone.Here he is the man and this movie is the definition of cool.This is the story of a simple thug who becomes the biggest crime-drug boss in Miami.Wonderful story,great actors and action.Beware of the bad language also.Mr Pacino seems comfortable with the role and a great Spanish accent sure to bring a few laughs.There are many great lines,delivered in an awesome way and plenty of violence-people are shot,cut to pieces with a chainsaw and lots more.'The world is yours' is Tony's motto and he sticks to it big time.Anyone who messes with him-you get the picture.For me the most powerful part of the film is the ending.Rival mob boss Sossa sends at least 30 people to kill Tony but the guy is a beast:'Say hello to my little friend' then he shoots everything that moves until he's shot in the back.Tragic but deserved ending to the new prince of crime.Scarface is truly an epic and amazing film.I can never get tired of watching the little Cuban guy wasting everyone in sight.",10,1,2,9 March 2008
The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk movie I've always wanted!!!
","This was without a doubt one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen simply because it is awesome to see one of your favorite comic book characters on the big screen in all his might.The 2003 version was beyond disappointing because it was far from the source material,too long and boring and of course not enough Hulk smash action.Thank God director Louis Leterrier fixed the mistakes Ang Lee made and created one of the best comic adaptations ever.The cast is great and Eddy Norton once again proves he's one of the best actors of his generation and the perfect man to play the tormented Bruce Banner.The rest of the cast is great also:Liv Tyler is a great Betty and is really sympathetic with the monster just like in the comics.Tim Roth is a great Blonsky and an even better Abomination,he's just pure badass evil.William Hurt is the best General Ross ever!!!He is literally pulled from the pages of the comic-divided between the duty to capture the rampaging monster and the love for his daughter he really nailed the part.One of the biggest improvements from the previous film is definitely the CGI-The Hulk looks as real as he can be-the skin coloring,textures and shades are all superb bravo to the effects guys they did a fantastic job.Abomination looks great too.His final clash with Hulk is something to talk about for a long time.This is what I call an epic fight.In conclusion I'd like to say that if you are a Hulk fan you must absolutely see this film and I bet you will love it.If you're not a Hulk fan you will enjoy it still.One of the most entertaining action packed movies for years.",10,2,3,24 June 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest action adventure movie ever.
","What makes this movie a masterpiece?Well everything.Let me tell you why.This film revolutionized the adventure genre to a whole new level.The epic action and stunts,the wonderful sets and and shooting locations are all top notch.In my opinion this is Harrison Ford's greatest character and role because when we see Indy him for the 1st time the experience is unforgettable.The archaeologist adventurer is the definition of a lovable character who is in search of ancient treasures and relics.My favorite moment of the movie is the very beginning deep in the Peruvian jungle.We get to see Indy in action and realize what he does for a living.The big rolling stone is a classic and that inspired many adventure rides in the big amusement parks around the world.All the action scenes throughout the movie are legendary and the best thing is that this was before the CGI era.They don't make action sequences like this anymore.Great stunt work by Vic Armstrong and all the crew involved.Director Steven Spielberg creates a timeless masterpiece for all ages and a legend in the face of Indy.The two sequels are also masterpieces but this one is my favorite from the trilogy.The music composed by John Williams is legendary and i believe there is no one who hasn't heard it.Everything else is history in the making.Truly the best of the best in the genre.Classic stuff.",10,0,1,18 March 2008
Se7en," Can't stop watching.You are already sucked into the story.
","The greatest thriller of all time right next to Silence of the Lambs.David Fincher has outdone himself and it shows.The story is simple.Two detectives must apprehend a twisted serial killer who punishes his victims for their own sins.But what they come across will soon change them both forever!!!Expert story teller Fincher builds non stop tension which nearly explodes by the end of the movie.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are at their best here.There is great chemistry between the two and Gwyneth Paltrow is terrific as Tracy.The end of the movie is one of the most shocking experiences ever on film.The first time when I saw Se7en i was shocked,horrified and just couldn't believe what just happened.THE END will shock you be sure but that is one of the reasons the movie is so good.The final lines by Somerset are moving:'Ernest Hemingway once wrote that the world is a fine place worth fighting for...I agree with the second part'.",10,7,10,29 February 2008
Fight Club," Strange but unique
","David Fincher continues his streak of great movies with Fight Club.This is perhaps his greatest cinematic achievement.A movie simply unique and unlike anything done before.Eddy Norton and Brat Pitt shine here and give amazing performances.The plot is rather strange. The narrator (Edward Norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. By attending the group, the narrator feels important and cared for and then is able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups. The narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), at the groups he goes to and his insomnia returns.During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is a soap salesman. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar. Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar. The narrator moves in with Tyler and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. After attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement. Soon, other fight clubs are established around the country, with Tyler's help. Get the picture?You have to see this masterpiece to appreciate it.A terrific movie on all levels.Fincher gives his best and gets the best from his actors.Highest admirations for creating one of the best movies ever with one of the best twists ever.",9,0,2,15 March 2008
The Terminator," 'You still don't get it do you?
","That Terminator is out there.It can't be bargained with.It can't be reasoned with.It will do everything and will not stop until you are dead.' The movie that turned Arnie into an international star and director James Cameron a highly acclaimed director.The story is dark and disturbing.A nuclear holocaust is about to take place and the machines will take over.The only hope for the remaining human resistance against them is the still unborn leader John Connor.His mother Sara doesn't suspect that a machine called Terminator is sent from the future to assassinate her and prevent John's entire existence.To protect Sara the human resistance sends a man named Kyle Reese.But will he succeed against an enemy who seems unstoppable?And so a dangerous game of cat and mouse begins.There is a lot of action,chills but most importantly a great story ,something new and fresh for 1984 when the movie was released.Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn both give amazing performances and the audience feels what they are going through.But the real credit goes to Arnold himself who is absolutely stunning as the mean machine that kills everyone that gets in its way.He gets shot,burned,hit by a truck and blown up but just keeps coming back.A famous scene is when the Terminator goes into the police station after Sara and kills at least 20 cops in the process.One of the greatest things about the movie is the metal endoskeleton of the robot which looks like Death,covered in metal as Cameron describes it.Its totally terrifying and brutal. In conclusion I'll say that this is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion and a must see whether you like this genre or not.",10,2,3,1 March 2008
The Godfather: Part II," Almost as good as the original!!!
","And that is saying a lot.Probably the most fantastic and well made sequel of all time.Some consider it to be even slightly better than the original but for me the first Godfather is still the best mainly because of Marlon Brando.Despite of that The Godfather part 2 is a flawless movie,a timeless masterpiece with countless qualities that crabs the viewer and never ceases to impress.Al Pacino delivers simply a stunning performance and deserved an Oscar for best actor.Here he isn't the fragile,insecure young man he was in the original film.Here he is wiser and more respectful.Perfect Michael Corleone.The rest of the cast is amazing too.Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and John Cazale as Fredo shine once again.Cazale as the treacherous Fredo has a bigger role and makes an even greater impact on the audience.But a lot of the credit has to go to the brilliantly cast Robert De Niro who indeed deserved to win the Oscar for best supporting role.His portrayal of the young Vito Corleone and his rise to power is simply stunning.Excellent work.Director Francis Ford Coppola is simply one of the greatest directors not only of his time but of all times and shows once again that he is the biggest fan of the novel and shows great respect both towards Mario Puzo and his work.",10,5,8,22 March 2008
Predator," Perfect in every way.
","This is an action sci-fi masterpiece on all levels.I have seen this film more than I can count.In my top 10 movies of all time.I first saw this when I was 5 years old and was immediately sucked into the story and characters.This film combines perfect action,drama,sci-fi and great humor.Arnold plays his greatest role here along with the terminator.He shows some serious acting skills which i always knew he had.His character Dutch is hardcore in every single way but has a heart also.All the others are great too with Billy being my favorite.This guy is the definition of awesome.And the Predator himself is the greatest alien in movie history.The director J.McTiernan builds a perfect characterization of him by showing only bits of the creature and teases the audience.By the time the team are taken one by one we are already on the edge too see what is this thing that rips spines,blows bodies and skins people alive just for the fun of it.The moment when the Predator finally comes out of the water is insane.He's bad to the bone.Later when he removes his mask you see a face so ugly that only his alien mother can love.It shows that Stan Winston is the best at what he does.And this is the 1st and only time when Arnold is beat almost to death.I mean how cool is to see him finally meeting somebody stronger than him,huh?Go see this movie if you haven't cause it's the best of the best in the genre.",10,21,25,28 February 2008
The Thing," The Ultimate in Sci-Fi Horror!!!
","The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and horror.",10,12,17,9 March 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'Come with me if you want to live'
","Says the Terminator to Sara Conner in one of the greatest sequels of all time.Jim Cameron achieved the greatness of the original and made an even more epic film this time around.When T2 came out in 1991 it revolutionized special effects to a whole new level.Arnold is the good guy here sent once again from the future but this time to protect the 10 year old John Conner-future leader of the human resistance against the machines targeted for termination by a new kind of terminator-the liquid T1000 portrayed perfectly by Robert Patric.What to say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever.Great plot,amazing action and performances by all the cast and a tear jerking scene with Arny at the end.A movie that you can watch again and again forever.One of Arnold's greatest roles along with T1 and Predator.",10,1,1,2 March 2008
Aliens," Better than Alien !!!
","WOW!!!Is this the best action sci-fi movie ever?Well yeah along with Predator and the first two terminators.This is a movie which gets better with each viewing.James Cameron manages to top the 1979 classic and this fact alone makes this film amazing.This time it's war and Ripley must fight her greatest fear once again but this time with the help of a kick ass marine squad.But what they find on LV-426 will send them to hell and back.And what a wild ride it is.Everything here is perfect.There isn't a single weak character here.My two most favorites are private Hudson(played by Bill Paxton)-total badass and corporal Hicks(Michael Biehn)the natural born leader.The film has excellent sets,kick ass action,quite a lot of chills,great humor and a perfect music score.Jenette Goldstein is absolutely hot in this role.Her macho chick Vasquez is awesome and hardcore.And the aliens here are frightening to the max.You never know when they'll show up.James Cameron makes these beasties more frightening than they ever were.They are smart enough to cut the power and use a specific fighting strategy when attacking.Stan Winston creates his masterpiece at the time-the Alien Queen.This thing is more evil and vicious than all the aliens combined!!!And when she rips Bishop in two it's freakin brutal.The final fight between Her and Ripley in the power loader is history in the making.I would like to conclude with the statement that this is a perfect movie and in my top 10 of all time.Along with Predator the best in the Alien/Predator franchise.",10,11,20,28 February 2008
The Usual Suspects," Greatest plot twist ever!!!
","This movie has the greatest plot twist ever.I'm not gonna risk and spoil it for you if you haven't watched the picture yet but be sure to do so immediately.Great actors who deliver great performances and the biggest question of them all-Who is Kaiser Soze?What a movie!Edge of you seat stuff.The building tension explodes in the end.The 1st time you view the film you may be confused a lot but it's normal.Just pay close attention to all the details on the 2nd viewing.Don't know what to say that hasn't already been said great movie,simply great.Brian Singer is a God for coming up with such a unique story and directing it as the professional that he is.",10,2,3,7 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," Daniel Craig continues to deliver!!!
","The guy just has what it takes to be a kick ass Bond and he continues to prove it in this film.After the excellent Casino Royale we get another excellent performance by our boy Craig who really seems to enjoy the role.The action begins in the first seconds as we get an extremely intense car chase in Italy(further into the film we also get boat and plane chases which are both fantastic)which stands up to the ones form the Bourne trilogy.The camera work is excellent and we can feel the intensity right away.The pacing is real fast and the film barely slows itself up.The twists and turns are plenty and it really makes the story that much more interesting.Unlike all the other Bond films this is absolutely a revenge flick as Bond tries to solve the mystery around Vesper's death and with each minute he gets closer.The fight sequences and choreography are superb!!!However one can't help but find similarities in Bond,Jason Bourne and Bryan's(from Taken)fighting styles.The first fight sequence is the best one by far.Bond fights M's bodyguard turned traitor Mitchell.The two fight on a rooftop and the fight ends on a platform in an abandoned building with a kick ass finish.I'm glad that M and Bond's mother-son relationship is further explored and there are both tension and respect between the two.The film also delivers one of the best Bond babes ever!!!Olga Kurylenko is absolutely beautiful and has the right attitude.She isn't a damsel in distress but a serious ass kicking babe.She and Sophie Marceau from TWINE are my two favorite Bond girls ever.What is interesting is that Bond and Camille have an entirely different relationship from what most would expect.See the film and you'll know what I mean.One more thing that really helps the movie is the great humor and funny scenes throughout which will definitely make you at least giggle.There is a hilarious scene in which one of Dominic Green's men asks Bond why didn't he kill Camille and Bond says:'Looks like I missed' and punches the guy off his bike in a hilarious way.The film of course has its weaknesses.Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene wasn't a particularly interesting villain and not at all menacing,the film was also too short and 20 minutes could have been added for more character development(or action sequences).My last complaint is pretty much my opinion cause others may like the direction they took with Bond here.He is no longer a silent and finesse as portrayed in all the other films.Now he's a killing machine,a tank who blows his cover and kills for laughs.Maybe Graig is a bit too hardcore but I'm sure he'll get closer to the classic Sean Connery portrayal in future films.I'm also looking forward to seeing Q and all the cool gadgets he will equip Bond with.Overall I'm giving the film 8.5/10 but I'll probably love it even more in the future.And most importantly don't listen to the so called critics,go and expect a great action film for the new generation.",8,3,8,15 November 2008
The Game," The Game is a killer!!!
",Excellent movie.Simply great.David Fincher is a genius at every genre he touches.I have no idea why this masterpiece is so underrated.This is top class thriller.Michael Douglas plays the arrogant Nicholas Van Orton-a businessman who is about to have a major change in his life.Douglas is on top of his game here and you can clearly see how his character changes from a self loving calm man to a scared and hurtful boy.Non stop thrills and chills combined with perfect acting makes the Game a wonderful experience and one of my favorite movies ever.The ending is a real shocker and you might dislike it from the 1st viewing but trust me it fits great after a few more viewings.Make sure you rent or buy this film if you haven't seen it yet.,10,2,4,5 March 2008
The Dark Knight," The best Batman movie indeed!!!
","OK so when a movie is surrounded with so much hype it's usually impossible to live up to the high expectations and not to disappoint the fans and moviegoers expecting the best movie of the year.But this movie is an exception - it is indeed the greatest Batman movie ever and the 2nd best comic book movie behind only Sin City.This is quality film-making at its best.Chris Nolan is just an amazing director and what he did with the source material is phenomenal.He manages to top his 2005 Batman Begins and create an even more mature and exciting movie which explores the dark side of every one of us,our inner side which we try to hide but are sometimes provoked to show.Nolan shows us a dark side of life and further explores it.You can tell that he did his homework and was inspired by great Batman comic stories such as The Dark Knight Returns,The Long Halloween and many more.The movie absolutely rises above its comic book boundary and is a unique achievement on its own creating a real earthy superhero who is actually human as much as each of us.The performances are all flawless to say the least.Our hero Christian Bale is a terrific Batman/Bruce Wayne who feels and knows that he has much responsibility on his shoulders and he's the one destined to fight crime but sometimes finds it hard to resist to the temptation of being a villain himself,to break the rules he had sworn to keep.The supporting actors all add depth to the movie.Michael Cane is good as Alfred although is still prefer Michael Gough as the butler,Gary Oldman is the perfect commissioner Gordon and looks and feels exactly like his comic archetype,Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much better Rachel than Katy Holmes and is anything but annoying.Now for me the best thing about the movie - the villains.Everything about Heath Ledger's masterful turn into Joker has already been said so I don't know what else to add except that he's a perfect Joker who feels exactly like Frank Miller's take on the villain.Jack Nicholson's take on the Joker was very different from Heath's so I think there shouldn't be any comparison between the two but I think we can all agree that they are both awesome.However what truly made me happy is Aaron Eckhart's Two Face.The two sided villain has always been my favorite Batman enemy and you can't imagine what joy it is to see him on the big screen exactly as he should be - evil,menacing and deadly and of course relying on his faithful coin.The whole Two Face story in the film is what intrigued me the most,seeing Harvey Dent as a person who fights against crime as much as Batman but unfortunately under circumstances turned into a criminal himself.The other bad guys are amazing too specially Eric Roberts who does one of his finest roles yet and shouldn't be overlooked.The twist and turns are plenty and you can never predict what will happen next.The action sequences are spectacular and epic of course and Nolan has improved his direction during the action scenes,the camera isn't so close to the fights and you get a clear view of what's going on.Just like its hero the movie is dark,the colors are dark in tone and you can literally feel the darkness Of Gotham City.In conclusion this is one of the best movies of recent years and for me one of the best ever.watch it and be amazed.",9,2,5,21 July 2008
Reservoir Dogs," 'Let me tell you what Like a virgin is about'
","Hell Yeah what a directional debut Quentin Tarantino makes.This guy is pure gold,a genius at writing movies and directing them.The story here may seem simple and standard but no way it is!The performances and direction are top notch.Good old violence and bad language plus lots of cool homages to the 70s specially with the amazing 'Little Green Bag' by George Baker Selection which just shines during the opening credits.The characters here are all anti heroes-thiefs,rapists and killers but the way they are presented by Quentin makes Harvey,Michael,Tim,Steve and the others shine.The viewer actually sympathizes with them because they are such dudes.This movie for me rivals Pulp Fiction in terms of great movie making and while Pulp is slightly better Reservoir Dogs certainly shines and marks the beginning of Quentin's phenomenal work.Truly an amazing film destined to be a timeless classic.",10,1,5,13 March 2008
Pulp Fiction," Quentin you're the man!!!
","This is a pure masterpiece folks.Actually a unique movie with its own style and feel unlike anything before it.You have to see it for yourself and find out what the film is all about because everybody has different interpretation of it.The essence of the 50s,60s and 70s captured and combined in one big hell of a movie.Highest admirations to all the actors who were involved in this movie.John Travolta is my number one character in the film fallowed closely by Sam Jackson,Bruce Willis and the hotter than ever Uma Thurman.The dialog is great and you feel like you're in the movie yourself connected with these people.Guns,blood,torture,rapes(and you'll never guess who got raped)and a briefcase full of whatever your imagination is.What Pulp Fiction right away-one of the definitive movies of the 90s and one of the best of all times.",10,4,9,29 February 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Criminally Underrated
",What is wrong with some people?This is without a doubt the most underrated movie of all time no question.Al Pacino's performance alone makes this an unforgettable classic but for some reason the movie was quickly forgotten and overlooked.In my opinion Pacino was stunning and did an incredible job portraying a tormented and tortured soul bearing the weight of his many sins mainly the killing of his brother Fredo.Michael Corleone in this movie confesses for all his crimes and the viewer feels for him despite all he has done.The supporting cast is also most impressive.Joe Mantegna as Joey Zasa is a memorable villain who proves to be danger for the Corleone family and wants to be in charge of business himself.Andy Garcia as the Don's nephew and Sonny Corleone's son gives an awesome performance and shows the audience he is indeed a kid of wild Sonny played with a passion by James Caan in the original.Many people considered that director Francis Ford Coppola's daughter Sofia was wrongly cast as Michael's daughter in the film but I think she did great and added dept to her character.The movie is amazing and powerful all the way but nothing tops the final scene in which Mary is shot and dies in her father's arms.It is truly magical and is sure to put a tear in your eye or at least grab you for a while.The way Pacino and Diane Keaton act during the scene alone makes it phenomenal.In conclusion I advice you not to ignore this wonderful piece of film-making.Be sure to watch it.It is worthy of being the final chapter in the Godfather saga and will impress you I'm sure.,10,18,34,25 March 2008
Die Hard," Reinvented Action!!!
","One of the most important movies in the action genre.There is probably no one who hasn't heard of Die Hard and John McClane-one of the big daddies of action.I have heard all kinds of stories about this movie.In my country for example people were waiting in lines half a day to get tickets and see this masterpiece pretty much like The Godfather before it.Until then most movies here were Russian which by definition means bad movies.So by the late 80s this was one of the grand movies and people were shocked and thrilled by the sudden quality change in films.This is the movie that turned Bruce Willis into an international star and introduced an action hero who unlike Arnold and Sly isn't a superhuman but a more ordinary guy who is just at the wrong place at the wrong time.He uses his head and harsh language to come up with solutions to nasty situations.And Willis's McClane is one of the coolest and toughest guys on film.Everything about this guy rocks.He gave a whole new look to action heroes.He doesn't give a crap about no one and always keeps his promises.Alan Rickman is a great,intelligent and memorable villain-a real threat to our boy.The action is spectacular and gives a new definition of 1 guy vs many guys.A advice you to immediately watch this everlasting masterpiece if you haven't already and see what all the fuzz is about.",10,4,6,16 March 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the most emotional films i've ever seen.
","Jack Nicholson is a God.One of the greatest actors of his time,of all times.Every time he's on screen he steals the show no matter who he is playing with.One flew over the cuckoo's nest is a phenomenal book by Ken Kesey,a classic,a very powerful book but the movie for me might be even slightly better because of the great direction of Mr Forman and his star Jack.Metallica's song Welcome Home(Sanitarium) is inspired by the book and movie and that alone makes the already cool song become even better.The movie itself really manages to transport you in a world of pain and suffering by seeing these people's sad life.But the performances really make you feel sympathetic with them and see how well they captured the spirit of the book.And Jack is the real deal who starts cheering everyone and immediately enters everyone's heart.The end when the big Indian puts an end to Randle's life with the pillow and then lifting the sink to smash the window holding him from freedom is so powerful that it's hard to describe.You have to see the movie to appreciate it.I'd like to conclude that this is an amazing film and for me Jack's greatest performance.A timeless classic that will never be forgotten.",10,2,4,8 March 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Best of the best.
","Let me tell you my opinion.Die Hard changed the action genre forever and revolutionized it.Die Hard 2 while fun had the same formula as the 1st and didn't introduce anything new.But this Die Hard is my favorite and I'll tell you why.Most people including myself love the original but I slightly prefer this movie because of its darker tone and the more cooler McClane whose life is falling apart and he is on the verge of becoming an alcoholic.For me Bruce Willis makes his greatest performance here.He nails the role better than ever.Director John McTiernan continues to develop his character and shows his expert skills creating a masterpiece with epic action,stunning performances and thrills and chills around every corner.The supporting cast or Sam Jackson is cool as always and the chemistry between him and Bruce is simply amazing.They make the perfect team.The villain in the face of Jeremy Irons is quite evil and nails the role.A chilling performance from the Oscar winner who makes a terrifying villain.I really wish they had kept the original ending of the movie in which the robbery succeeds and John is fired from the LAPD.Planning revenge on Simon he tracks him to his hideout and offers him to play 'McClane says' with him or a Russian Roulette game but with a rocket launcher instead of a gun.The rest is history in the making too bad they cut this ending.It would have been so much better.What more can I say?This is a modern day masterpiece criminally underrated and deserves a grade much higher.One of the superb movies of the century.",10,0,1,19 March 2008
The Green Mile," Right next to Shawshank!!!
",Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.,9,8,11,29 March 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Magnificent is the way to describe it.
","Yes this is simply a magnificent piece of work which remains powerful and moving and probably always will.It's been 14 years but who can forget such a masterpiece.This is a movie about how strong the human faith and spirit can be.Even in the most difficult moments we have to remain strong and believe in justice.This is what Shawshank is all about.I have never read the Steven King novel but he definitely should be proud that a director such as Frank Darabont has the passion and desire in making a powerful and faithful adaptation to King's work.A moving film with superb performances from all the actors but the real credit goes to Tim Robbins as the wrongfully accused Andy Dufresne whose spirit and will help him find freedom and Morgan Freeman as Ellis 'Red' Redding who serves a life-long sentence but hopes he can be freed from guilt.Throughout the movie we witness much suffering,injustice and sorrow but that's what makes the characters so pleasant and worth sympathizing for.Andy's desire to become a free man again is truly a magical but also difficult adventure.But he never loses his hope and that is what helps him succeed.The final scene when Andy and Ellis meet each other outside the steel cage prison is phenomenal and touching.It is a real shame that a movie so great didn't win a single Oscar although it had 7 nominations.А real unfairness cause this movie is indeed better than Forrest Gump.In conclusion I'll just say that Shawshank is a timeless masterpiece and deserves to be in the top 10 greatest films of all time.",9,1,2,29 March 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," The most chilling of all thrillers!!!
",I have seen this movie so many times and every time it gets better and better.What makes it so special you ask?Well the great actors for start.Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is the best choice for the role.He was born to play the brilliant but psychopathic at the same time cannibal with a taste for livers.I have read the book three times and be sure that the movie follows it closely.Jodie Foster as the unexperienced but intelligent Clarice Starling is also the most perfect choice.She gives depth to her character and it shows.Scott Glenn is great as her mentor Jack Crawford.Wonder why Glenn never became a bigger star he sure deserved it with his performance here.Be warned that the movie has quite a few chills and will take you to the edge with its intense music score and actors.Director Jonathan Demme created a masterpiece and Thomas Harris should be proud.Hannibal and The Red Dragon are good on their own but they just can't touch this movie.Its just too perfect to compare to.,10,0,2,29 February 2008
The Matrix," Back in 1999 they shocked us with originality.
","And originality means the Matrix.I remember seeing it back in 1999 with my dad and man we were blown away.Original concept mixed with superb acting,amazing visual effects,great fights and an intelligent villain unlike anyone before.Yeah agent Smith is awesome.By now you should know what the matrix is-a computer generated dream world built to keep humans harmless and living in denial.Neo is humanity's last hope for salvation and the leader Morpheus believes in him that he will set them free.The Washowski Bros show respect to Kubrick,Cameron and Scott and create an original and intriguing movie unlike anything before.After the disappointing sequels I appreciated this movie even more.Can't think of anyone who would have played a better Neo than Keanu Reeves.He gives all his heart and soul portraying a man insecure and without confidence in himself feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders.Laurence Fishburne is stunning also as his mentor who believes in him more than anything and is willing to sacrifice his own life to safe Neo's.Waking up from Wonderland is an emotional draining experience and the audience is sucked into the story which gets more and more interesting.The Matrix is undoubtedly one of the greatest action movies of all time.A modern classic.",9,0,1,18 March 2008
Heat," Two of the best in one magnificent masterpiece.
",People were wondering will this movie live up to the hype or suffer being just a major letdown.NO WAY!!!This is truly an amazing piece of art that stands up to the best movies in the genre.Some many fine actors but only two legends-Pacino and De Niro.These guys just stood out and gave the best they've got to outshine one another and the competition has never been so interesting.One is the brilliant cop the other is the mastermind of all robbers each one the best at what he does.The scene where the two are outplaying each other is one of the best on film.The two giants are just amazing and standing before one another was truly a great moment.Throughout the movie I personally sympathized with Mr De Niro seeing that he was actually very human and more noble than Al but that was probably director Michael Mann's idea.The end is simply powerful.I cried the 1st time I saw Neil getting shot but that was part of the magic.Be sure to see this right away if you haven't yet.,10,1,3,6 March 2008
Sin City," 'I love hit men.
","No matter what you do to them, you don't feel bad'.This is one of the greatest lines in the movie and one of the greatest movies ever made.It's just perfect in every way.Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Sin City comics since 1998 when I first read THE HARD GOODBYE.Frank Miller is a genius at what he does.All his work is amazing.BATMAN:YEAR ONE,THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS,DAREDEVIL:THE MAN WITHOUT FEAR and 300 are all great.That's why I'm so pleased with this movie-it's the most perfect comic book adaptation ever.It sticks right to the source.Robert Rodriguez was obviously the perfect choice for the director.He shows great respect for Miller's work and transports it's unique visual style on the big screen.The casting is perfect.When I first heard that Bruce Willis was playing Hartigan I was a little skeptical since Bruce wasn't old enough for the role but the end result was great as Bruce nailed the role.My favorite character however(in the comics and movie)is Marv Almighty.Mickey Rourke just blew me away with his performance.This is one of those cases when you can say someone was born to play a certain role.Absolutely stunning performance by Mickey.Be aware that the movie is exactly like the comic which means that there is a lot of violence.Jackie Boy and his gang die in the most disturbing ways,people are shot,stabbed and blown to pieces so be warned.But the violence isn't something the movie can go without.It's an important part of the comic so it must be present here too.If you like masterpieces this movie is for you.",10,0,1,3 March 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indy brings his dad in a 3rd adventure.
",A thrilling wild ride once again.The perfect trilogy is completed.Indy is not alone.His dad is here too played magnificently by Sean Connery who shines along with his son.The chemistry between Ford and Connery is amazing.These two work so well together.The two go in search of the Holy Grail but find lots of danger during the way.The Nazis are after them wanting the Grail and its power.I must say that this time the Indy girl is the best.Alison Doody is so sexy and amazing and when you find that she has slept both with Indy and Henry it's hilarious.The creepy crawlers this time unlike the snakes in Riders or the roaches in Doom are rats who are definitely the grossest.The film as any other Indy film delivers amazing action and stunts plus a little more humor this time around contributed mostly by Connery who seemed to had a ball shooting the movie.The lightеr tone stands out quite well after the darker 2nd film.This is a perfect 10/10 movie along with the 1st two Indy adventures and is a wild ride sure to entertain you for 2 hours.Movies have never been so enjoyable.,10,0,1,18 March 2008
Goodfellas," Never knew being a gangster was this much fun
","This is my favorite Scorsese film.Every time I watch it I'm transported away into a world of fun,crime and tragedy.This is due to the excellent direction and the terrific cast.Great acting we have here.Robert De Niro,Rey Liotta and Joe Pesci are simply outstanding in their roles.You have the feeling you're watching real gangsters do what they do best-have fun.Their whole life as Scorsese sees it is non stop fun with the only difference that their concept of fun is a little different than the one of average people.They steal,drink,curse and kill all for the fun of it.It's their way of life.As Henry says they think of ordinary people as a low life scum.It is they who are smart and score the big cash with no difficulty at all.A simply unique portrayal of organized crime which looks absolutely accurate.My favorite character is Tommy De Vito for whom Joe Pesci should have won an Oscar.Simply outstanding work and one of the best movie characters for me ever.Goodfellas is truly a work of art and it is always a pleasure to view this modern masterpiece in which bad people are the law.",10,1,2,17 March 2008
The Godfather," The Greatest movie ever!!!
","This is my most favorite movie of all time.Words cannot describe its greatness.I have heard all kinds of stories about when it first came out and how people were constantly praising it but it's for a reason believe me.This film has the finest acting i have ever seen.You don't believe - then watch this masterpiece and see what i'm talking about.All the actors shine:Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,James Caan and the others were born to play their roles and you can see how passionate they were while playing.But the greatest one of them all is undoubtedly the GREAT Marlon Brando who was so eager to play the role that he sent director F.F.Coppola a tape on which he presents his way of playing the Godfather.Coppola is immediately impressed and hires Brando.From here it's all history in the making.The most emotional and powerful moment is when the Godfather gets shot.Pure brilliance.Every time I see that scene it sends shivers down my spine.If I have to be honest every scene has its impact and emotional message.If you haven't seen the movie yet fix your mistake and watch it right now.You'll be amazed!!!",10,1,2,28 February 2008
