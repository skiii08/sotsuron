Mission: Impossible III," Exactly as expected
","Anyone that goes to see this movie must realize that they aren't going to witness an amazing cinematic feat. This isn't a work of art, but more a movie that is fun to watch and talk about after. Throughout the movie my heart was pounding and no one dared look away from the screen or they might miss something. An eight out of ten rating may be a little bit high, but I had fun watching this movie and it was a great movie to see with your entire family. There was no cursing or awkward scenes. This was simply an action packed movie with a better plot than I thought it would have. I would definitely recommend people go see this movie, just for the sake of having fun at the movies, even if it isn't an epic drama. There are those scenes where Tom Cruise almost gets killed, but he is still able to take out all the bad guys and escape. So what if it isn't realistic. I loved it. Just remember, don't expect great acting or a great screenplay. Just have fun.",8,3,4,14 May 2006
Mystic River," A masterpiece
","One of the best movies I've ever seen. With great cast (Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon) this movie excels in every aspect. Director Clint Eastwood shows off his skills while putting together a fabulous film. It starts when the three stars are kids and one gets abducted and sexually abused. He is never the same again. Throughout the course of the movie, the three friends reunite when Jimmys's (Penn) daughter is murdered. Bacon plays a detective, while Robbins is the lead suspect for some time. This film is quite dark, considering what it is about. It is a psychological thriller, with a great plot and amazing acting. This should have won best picture, but it did win two Oscars for actor (Penn) and supporting actor (Robbins). A great movie.",10,1,3,3 February 2006
