Hereditary," What's the hype about?
","Ok, seriously? I watched a LOT of horror movies and thrillers and this will definitely not be on my top 10 list. More than the first half of the movie is totally unneccesary. I even started to wonder if I was really watching a horror movie or just a bad drama. The story hat a lot of potential but whenever things started to get interesting you were thrown back to the boring and never ending storyline. There was only one scene in the entire movie that made me cringe my face. For that I don't need to spend 2 hours in the theater! I left thinking about what just happened or better to say did not happen. Those who say this was one of the best horror movies ever obviously never watched a real one.",2,4,9,12 July 2018
