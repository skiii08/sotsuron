Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good beginning but a bit too cute
","Okay, this movie starts out automatically as a 7.0 simply because it is the Star Wars saga.  It loses 2 points for cuteness(3 points if you REALLY hated Ewoks) and picks up 2 points for great visual effects and the GREAT dueling scenes.  The story is a little flat and that heart pounding beginning we are used to from the Star Wars movies is missing but the plot leaves open some very intriguing possibilities for the next movie which gives it just enough appeal so that the movie was not disappointing.  Probably ranks evenly or just below Jedi when comparing the four movies (with Empire and the original being better).  Overall I would recommend the movie but be prepared to REALLY hate the Jar Jar character. Overall rating 7.5.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
There's Something About Mary," Crude, tasteless, vulgar, not funny and those are the good points
","Well if you can't seem to get enough of jokes about the handicapped, sexual stalkers and pointless masturbation scenes then Something About Mary is just the movie for you.  However, if you have an inkling of taste leave the sophmoric humor to the sophomores and spend the evening doing something a lot more fun like getting a root canal.  Not only did I find the movie offensive and humorless but this pointless dribble droned on for over two hours.  When I looked at the time on the VCR counter at 1 hour I thought at least it will be over soon.  Please don't think I'm just some prude who is easily offended.  I can appreciate silly and moronic humor with the best of them.  This movie is like a two hour episode of Beavis and Butthead without the class and wit of Beavis and Butthead.  Please avoid this movie at all costs.",1,20,36,30 April 1999
