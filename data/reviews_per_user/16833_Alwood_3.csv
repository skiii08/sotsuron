The Longest Yard," When is Hollywood going to stop remaking great movies?
","I attended an early screening of this film and actually dozed off about 20 minutes into it, remaining in that state for about another 20 minutes. In spite of a few chuckles, the 2005 incarnation of the classic black comedy THE LONGEST YARD, is yet another example of a big studio lacking the imagination and ingenuity to tell NEW stories, by remaking a great film from yesteryear (which Paramount has done recently with films like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and ALFIE, also with middling results).First problem: who is going to buy diminutive Adam Sandler as a former NFL pro??? He simply doesn't have the physical attributes of a professional athlete, and right away, the film loses credibility with his casting.Second, Chris Rock is relegated to spitting out lines from a script that sounds like it was written by committee (which it undoubtedly was) and as a result, most of his lines fall flat. If the filmmakers were smart, they would have just 'let him go,' so he could improvise with his very unique, brilliant brand of edgy humor. He is utterly wasted.Third, poor Burt Reynolds, who headlined the original 1974 version of the film, looks like he can't wait to get paid and go home to Florida, now playing the role of Nate Scarborough, the aging former gridiron star that was played by the late Michael (HILL STREET BLUES) Conrad in the original. I'm a big fan of Burt, but he completely phones it in here, another example of a fine actor who is wasted in this corporate 'product.' Finally, the original LONGEST YARD was a tough, bone-crunching, 'hard R' film, even by today's standards. The characters were very well-developed, from Eddie Albert's corrupt warden, to Burt's tormented, self-loathing Paul Crewe, to Ed Lauter's sadistic captain of the guard. Helmed by the great Robert Aldrich, the film was a potent mix of very black humor, and very tough, violent drama. Watching it today, it not only holds up beautifully, but even feels contemporary. The remake, by contrast, is a watered down, PG-13, middle of the road piece of Cool Whip. What was an edgy, tough film for adults, has been made into a 'safe' film that will offend few, in spite of a few 'poo-poo, pee-pee' jokes, aimed at the junior high crowd. There is NO character development in this at all. Everyone in the film is presented as a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out. We never gain any insight into why they do what they do, why they are who they are, or how they even wound up in prison to begin with.The moral of the story: GET OFF YOUR LAZY BUTTS, Hollywood! There are a plethora of great writers and directors out there who are waiting tables, and who have amazing, contemporary stories to tell to the world. Give them that shot. That's your job. Quit remaking great films from yesteryear. Even if you do them relatively well (as in the MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remake), they still will never stack up against the original. It's kind of like covering a song made famous by Sinatra or the Beatles: once it's been done in 'signature' fashion, everything else is going to seem like a forgery.* 1/2 out of 10",1,1,3,12 March 2006
Collateral," 'THE TERMINATOR' REDUX
","Another big summer movie disappointment, loaded with talent behind and in front of the camera, a big budget, and all the ingredients of what should produce a good film, but winds up being hopelessly mediocre. If anything, this is so derivative of the original 'TERMINATOR,' that all originality goes out the window from the first few frames on. Tom Cruise, while you're great playing all-American types like Jerry Maguire, or conflicted all-Americans like your character in 'MINORITY REPORT,' you simply aren't an edgy badass! This film, and 'THE LAST SAMURAI' prove that in spades. While 'COLLATERAL' has a couple tense, exciting scenes (particularly the shootout in the Koreatown nightclub) courtesy of director Michael Mann, one of our finest filmmakers, the film is overall very predictable, with uninteresting, cardboard characters. The attempts at fleshing out said characters during Cruise and Jamie Foxx's conversations in the cab seem forced at best. Fine actors like Mark Ruffalo and Bruce McGill are wasted in throwaway supporting roles. Overall, a real letdown. I expect more from a top flight director like Michael Mann, who usually shoots for the top. This one just made me feel like everyone was aiming for the middle. 5/10",5,1,1,30 July 2004
The Departed," Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!
","Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",10,874,1347,3 October 2006
