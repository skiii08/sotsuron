Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing and overrated
","As a huge fan of the original I was excited for this, and with a stellar cast including gosling, Leto, Ford and Wright-Penn and with Denis Villeneuve at the helm this could have been epic. Sadly it's just another example of Hollywood cashing in on our beloved memories. A sprawling 2 hours and 20 Minutes of boredom, pretty boredom mind you, they did a good job recreating the original look and feel of the first movie, just to populate it with a terrible script and story that had so many loose ends that you end up not caring where you will end up. Again i wanted to love this movie, but after 2 hours I was waiting for the end credits and the lights to go on",3,13,26,8 October 2017
