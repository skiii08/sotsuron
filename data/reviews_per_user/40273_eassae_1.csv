Marie Antoinette," What the?
","I really had no expectations for this movie, as I had heard nothing about it. With in five minuets of the movie starting I was wondering if the movie was supposed to be an ironic comedy. When Jason Schwartzman made his first appearance I actually burst out laughing. I really don't know if I was supposed to or not. It's all down hill from there. The music is generic and has nothing to do with the scenes, Coppola needs a lesson from Baz Luhrman. The camera work and lighting are mediocre at best, especially with what they had to work with. The dialogue was written for someone in grade school. I just really can't believe people got together, spent tons of money and made this movie. I usually don't like registering for forums and giving out my e- mail, and I see that others have felt the same way, but I had to express somewhere how bad this movie is.",1,7,11,1 April 2009
