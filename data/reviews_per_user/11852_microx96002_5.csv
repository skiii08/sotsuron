3:10 to Yuma," Big disappointment, mean spirited western
","While the performances are good, I found this remake to be a disappointing, mean spirited western, and not the old fashioned western I thought it was going to be. The over the top violence just ruined it for me. For my money the Van Heflin Glen Ford original is miles ahead, and a character driven western, that doesn't dwell on mean spiritedness. Best performance comes from the only classy actor in the movie, Peter Fonda, who wasn't given enough to do. In my opinion, stay away from this and rent or purchase (you won't be disappointed) the original. Well, I was going to leave it at that, but apparently I didn't ramble on enough to publish this review. Perhaps now I have enough on here for it to work! What ever happened to short to the point reviews? Why do I have to have 10 lines??",5,1,5,15 September 2007
District 9," Something Different... in the beginning! (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)
","OK, did anyone else notice, all or most of the reviews on here are from Australia, and from 'early' screenings of the movie, AND they are all praising how great it is?! Well, OK, it is NOT a bad movie, it is 'different' in the beginning. However, the plot is so full of holes, they could've called it 'Swiss Cheese'. I had reservations when I saw the blurb 'Peter Jackson Presents' as opposed to a Peter Jackson Film. The holes come from a lot of unanswered questions about the aliens, they've been on the Earth for 20 years, but nobody seems interested in the huge spacecraft hovering in the sky, or who or where the aliens come from. South Africa seems to be an isolated country, they took on the burden of looking after these alien 'prawns' all by themselves. Where is the international community, all the scientists, why aren't they studying the technology of the ship, obviously, they knew how to get into it. There appears to be no communication with the aliens, where did they come from, and why? The interrogation seen in the preview was cut from the movie.Like I said, it started out good, but what was a seemingly intelligent approach to the Sci-Fi movie, slowly developed into the usual action/chase/explosion movie halfway thru. Leaving us with all the unanswered questions about the creatures and the ship.So, hopefully there will be a sequel that answers all these questions, however all these misleading reviews by people promoting their own film can only hurt it in the long run, and the chances of us getting our questions answered. Maybe the DVD extras will tell! To the producers, thank you for trying something different, but next time, keep it different all the way thru.",6,7,24,15 August 2009
Midsommar," Pure tripe!
","Don't bother, if there was a 0 score it would be too much. Nonsensical horror cult drama, wants to be The Wicker Man and fails miserably. Not scary or frightening, but occasional stomach churning non-entertainment that drags on for two and a half hours. Save yourself the displeasure!",1,4,5,14 April 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Great fun scare-fest!!
","This is a good old fashioned 1980's Sam Raimi terror-fest right here! Straight out of his Evil Dead era. For anyone sick and tired of the 'tired old' slasher genre, This gypsy's curse tale is something refreshing! It's a 'Creepy' or 'Eerie' or a 'Tales from the Crypt' comic book come to life. Totally entertaining, fun, scary and funny horror film. By the way, does anyone know if the Oldsmobile that the old gypsy was driving, is Sam Raimi's Olds from the Evil Dead and Army of Darkness movies? Also, where was Bruce Campbell? Not even a little cameo appearance?? Go see Drag Me To Hell, you won't be disappointed! Don't be put off by the PG 13 rating either, it's still got plenty of blood, gore and shock surprises for everyone.",8,2,4,31 May 2009
WALLÂ·E," WTF did I hear??
","Correct me if I'm wrong, but was it just me or did I hear not one but two different characters, at two different intervals in this movie utter the line 'what the fu..?' Stopping short of completing the phrase! Very sneaky I thought of Disney/Pixar to slip in some swearing in a kid's movie. And don't tell me 'what the fu..' is not the same as completing the phrase! So parents, beware - foul language alert.Apart from that, I found the movie boring, even the kid next to us developed ADD while watching it, and kept asking his parents if it was over yet. Typical amazing Pixar CGI animation, but lack of a real story or plot, and no real affection for an emotionless main character, and repetitive gags didn't help either. The best thing about this movie was the short before it, Presto, was a throwback to the old Disney Mickey Mouse/Donald Duck type cartoons, only this time in CGI.Main feature 5/10, Presto gets an 8/10",5,7,23,1 July 2008
