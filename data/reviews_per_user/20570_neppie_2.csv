Requiem for a Dream," Not much glamorous here
","Too many films dealing with alcohol and addiction are in the '28 Days' camp. They glamorize use and recovery rather than take on the reality. 'Requiem' does not fall into that trap. It accurately portrays what it is like from the perspective of the addict and from the outside. The emotional grip this left me with was similar to 'Leaving Las Vegas'. What that movie did to present the life on alcoholic is what this does for addiction. Unfortunately its rating might prevent those who might most benefit from ever seeing it. Recovery rhetoric says the only possible outcomes of continued addiction are jails, institutions or death. That clich√© is aptly captured in the paths these characters follow.",8,2,3,31 December 2013
Hugo," Too smart, with panache for good measure
","I realized early, when the film introduced a young girl whose active vocabulary included 'reprobate,' this would be a unique experience. I was willing to suspend belief to enter this world and discover what other smart surprises might lie beneath the brassy surface. In this age am not easily impressed with visual effects and abhor movies scripted for action sequences without substance. Without spoiling will only reveal there is meaning and purpose to every element that is apparently lost to some, so can't recommend this for everyone. For any person who values clever writing and subtlety above panache(!), you might find this worth savoring and not be bored.",8,2,2,27 December 2013
