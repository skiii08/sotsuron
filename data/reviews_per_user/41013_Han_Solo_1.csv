Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the second coming of Christ - Just good, old-fashioned Star Wars
","To anyone who is a hater of Star Wars - bug off - we don't really care about your opinion. To those who truly love Star Wars - whoo-hoo!! Our wait has not been in vain. While hype has inflated this movie past tolerable conditions, ignore that, and just enjoy the beginning of the Star Wars saga. There's really not much to say that hasn't already been said, so just go out, and judge for yourself, for neither I, nor IMDB can change or influence your opinion of it. Have fun, and may the Force be with you. Han_Solo",10,0,0,29 May 1999
