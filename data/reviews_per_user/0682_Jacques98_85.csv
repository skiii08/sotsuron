The Blair Witch Project," A very intense movie for people who can appreciate what it tries to accomplish.
","Something that so much of the horror genre lacks is realism. While 'classics' like A Nightmare on Elm Street do nothing but bash you over the head with a block of cheese, they get positive reviews because they follow the same tired, safe formula that make the horror fans go in their pants due to nostalgia. The majority of the horror genre isn't really scary, and it never was. When The Blair Witch Project first came out it was the only movie to break these rules and delve into true, realistic terror. It didn't follow a formula. It tried to recreate the terror of someone lost in the woods on film, without the cheese or eye candy. I think that is why it captivated me. I've seen thousands of movies in my life, the majority horror movies, and maybe less than 5% really scared me. I'm not sure The Blair Witch Project scared me, but, I can say I felt the terror in the characters and script more than the vast majority of the other horror movies I've seen combined.But there is another factor it seems no one is mentioning in their reviews. If you've never been lost in the woods, as I've been many times, I'm not really sure you could appreciate or understand the fear that the characters were feeling. If you're not a camper, I really doubt you'd like this movie whatsoever. A lot of the negative reviews from people calling this 'stupid' or 'boring', I can understand if they've never been lost in the woods. This is NOT a film everyone will like, or should like, and that is something someone really needs to say.Because I'm reviewing this in 2008, not 1999, I'm going to have to add that this movie is not like Cloverfield whatsoever. Cloverfield was a huge adventure caught on a small camera, while this is a small adventure caught on a small camera. If you liked Cloverfield (or vice versa) and are looking for a similar experience, this isn't it. They're both good movies, but for very different reasons.The main flaw that a lot of people are having a problem with is the pacing, which is reasonably slow. The reason for this is because it is meant to echo real life, not bash you with an explosive beginning like is typical Hollywood. Some will find this boring. Some won't because they appreciate realism. I fit into the latter.Overall, a very intense movie . . . if you know how to understand it. I found it very enjoyable and lacking of the typical horror cheese, which is something I can't say much anymore. Very much worth watching. You are not a real horror fan if you haven't at least viewed this once, because it's unlike anything that has ever been made before it.3/10",7,1,3,10 October 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than the first, but not as entertaining.
","This is the only movie I've ever seen that I knew would be perfect long before it was over. When the action happens, it is much more gritty and cringe-worthy than the first Kill Bill. The final climax is nothing but sheer cliché-defying genius that I'm sure will make a lot of people made, but I still can't deny the awesome moral that it brings.This movie has some of the most amazing and intense scenes in cinema and is not to be missed by anyone. It surpasses it's processor in nearly every level. Humor, grit, genius, originality, except . . .. . . the only thing that disappointed me: the lack of blood. After the gallons of it in Kill Bill, I would have at least expected one scene for old time's sake. Also, the talking scenes can be a little boring because they're not as good as Pulp Fiction. It isn't as entertaining as the first movie, even though everything about it was improved.But this is a must see. Amazing in every way.10/10",10,1,2,3 September 2008
The Ring," How can traditional horror get any better than this?
","Let me be blunt for a second: I hate most everything that is defined as 'traditional' or 'classic' because they're almost always synonyms for unoriginality and predictability. Movies with those tags usually amount to nothing more than a big-breasted woman (who is topless half the screen time) being chased by a killer/monster(s) until she either finds a way to kill him/it or dies. That's all. Point A, topless sex scene, fake scare, 'Oh my God! The monster is real!' scene, chase, woman lives/dies. For reasons like this, I have always preferred horror movies like Saw where every rule/plot you think you know is thrown out. However, The Ring completely made me remember that traditional horror can still be complex and original . . . and actually scary. In more way than one, The Ring is The Shining of its time.First, let me get the cinematography out of the wayit's gorgeous and incomparable. The blue tent has never been done to this level of effectiveness, and the camera angles take me back to the time when people actually put effort into cinematography.The plot is one of the most complex and memorable a ghost story has ever had. Also, it's revealed through action, mystery, and actually requires the main character to actually physically do something rather than just talk and talk until I fall asleep, as in most movies anymore.The acting is solid on all fronts. There is entertainment value, rather than just another cliché social commentary. The storytelling is never bloated or boring. The Ring also never plays it safe and uses the easy clichés that it could use. I also can't point to a single cheesy moment, ever.Overall, I cannot think of a more perfect example of truly flawless traditional horror. It ranks among The Shining and Alien for me. I can understand why a lot of people wouldn't like it, and it isn't for everyone, but I loved it. Watch it and make up your own mind. Just know that the original Japanese version has had more impact on the horror genre than most any other movie of our time, and the remake, in my opinion, is far superior.10/10",7,1,1,21 September 2008
Fight Club," Sorry, it bored me to tears. And then made me mad with bad storytelling.
","Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed onceI heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the cliché 'We're men raised by women!' so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this 'daring' or 'original' needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of 'We're men raised by women!', so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alivebut the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as menonce again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understandincluding false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5/10",5,5,14,16 September 2008
Memento," Just throw the doughnut away.
","Let me get it out of the way and say that I am a thriller buff. I'm not one of the countless reviewers on this site who watched Memento and didn't understand itI understood the plot perfectlyand I am certainly not one of the countless reviewers who gave this a negative score because they see it as poor cinema. I don't have a pretentious bone in my body.I am writing a negative review of Memento solely because it's exactly like everything I've seen before, and that's something not many people complain about.The main problem I have with the thriller genre is that it repeats itself, in the same way the sci-fi genre repeats itself. When thriller films don't outright copy one another, they always seem to think if they can find some new, original plot they're going to be groundbreaking. The only problem with that last statement is that most thrillers with 'new, original' plot-lines still simply have the exact same things happening on screen as all the others. The whole wife-is-murdered-I-must-avenger-her plot. Car chases. People talking about the plot. Intense confirmation between bad guy and good guy. You know the drill.While Memento tries very hard to avoid those obvious things, and in the end it somewhat does, it's still nothing you haven't seen before. It plays out exactly like every other thrilleravenge-wife, gather info, kill guy who did itand ends exactly like every other thrillerreversal of expectations. Some of the plot details may be a bit fresh, but when you see the same things that you've seen in every other thriller, who really cares? Memento uses the common mistake thriller writers and directors both make: watching a whole typical movie just to get to the less-typical ending is just boring and forgettable. There is no entertainment value in it. It's the same exact mistake The Usual Suspects made. It's like trying to force yourself to eat a stale long john doughnut just to get to the cream filling. You'll end up throwing the doughnut away.So how great is this 'awesome, unbelievable' plot twist? Pretty average. It's a plot twist, sure, but with such a pathetic main plot, once again, who really cares they made it a little less pathetic in the last ten minutes? It's still the generic man-must-avenge-wife story.How was the directing? Once again, pretty typical. It just takes some elements of metafiction and puts them on filmso what? Also, the use of black-and-white intertwined is just getting downright cliché, being that most every film with 'amazing directing' (big emphasis on the quotes) uses it. I will give Christopher Nolan a bit of credit, because he does keep Memento a bit more fast-paced than most thrillers I've seen, but that's about as far as I can say. It still certainly isn't thrilling, and I find that ironic.So what it comes down to is this. If you're a hardcore thriller buff like myself, this is essential for you to see, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. If you're an average movie watcher who just wants something entertaining and smart, look elsewhere. Fast.2/10",2,3,5,6 December 2008
Underworld," One of the better action movies.
","Overall, if you look at it as just a fun action movie I think you'll enjoy it. The over-the-top action reminds me of a video game, which is really fun to watch. I think it long surpasses The Matrix in this aspect, as well.The blue camera effects and Kate were both amazing. The plot line was just as slick and stylish as the action. But the werewolves were stupid looking. That is the single style choice I think I disagree with. I've heard people call it the new Romeo and Juliet, but that is untrue. It follows that structure for a while, but by the end it dismisses anything that would even suggest that. This blows Romeo and Juliet out of the water, anyway.Action-horror fans will be in awe. As long as you don't look too deep, I don't see why people seem to hate it so much.5/10",5,0,0,3 September 2008
Coraline," Hansel and Gretel without Hansel. And without imagination.
","* Just to get this out of the way: I did not view this in 3D, thus cannot comment on that aspect.When you go and see a PG-rated animate film, what do you expect? A few laughs, a fun main character, something to keep your kid's attention, a creative story, and, possibly, that nostalgic feeling of childish wonder. Fantasy writers seem to think they understand this wonder-filled feeling more than anyone else, and thus I've yet to see a single fantasy writer who didn't pump out a generic coming-of-age, horror-teamed, Disney Land-inspired children's book at least once before the end of their career. Neal Gaiman, the writer of the original Coraline children's book, is no exception. He's also no exception to the unwritten rule among such generic fantasy writers that this children's book that I just described has be as unoriginal and predicable as humanly possible, otherwise it's too much for the children reading it to comprehend. Or, more likely, they just lack a single creative idea within their heads. I've read a lot of Gaiman books before, and this lack of imagination seems to be something that is contentious among all his works. Simply put, I could write up a page-long list of other authors that pre-date Gaiman and write the exact same stories he does, and they all think they're oh-so-original. I can also come up with a page-long list of movies that pre-date Coraline, but tell the exact same story. Is it so much to ask for a little creativity these days? The setting for Coraline, the film, is completely generic for modern fairy tales like this. A big house. Coraline, the character, is also completely generic. An adventurous little girl with a slight punk edge. The secondary character, again, are all generic. Weird little boy, cat, unloving parents, fortunetelling old ladies, acrobatic old man. So, from the set-up alone, it's impossible to ignore how cliché and imaginationless Coraline, the film, really is. You've seen this a thousand times. You saw it with Alice in Wonderland, you saw it with Narnia, you saw it with The Corpse Bride . . . and if I had to, I could list at least thirty more. This is completely, wholesale unoriginal material, and that's apparent from the first five minutes.The story is even more generic. It's Hansel and Gretel, minus Hansel. The generic main character finds a wonderful place filled with everything she lacked at home, and then things go wrong. Oh my! Who would have guessed?! I realize I'm criticizing this movie from the point-of-view of the bitter old man that I am at heart, but even my little sister, who I took to see this, admitted Coraline was completely predictable and forgettable. It's exactly what you expect. If fantasy writers understand children as well as they think they do, then why don't they give them a little more credit that they know what stories are repeated to the point of nausea? Seriously. In my theater alone, I heard countless little kids telling their parents how bored they were. At least half the families there left the theater before the last thirty minutes. If you want horror-themed animated movies that aren't just rehashes of the same predictable plot, I suggest A Nightmare Before Christmas (obviously) and Monster House (severely underrated).Another problem with the boring factor. The movie repeats itself constantly, and you'll see the same exact scenes play out at least three times each by the closing credits. It drags on and on.Coraline does have some entertainment value, and I will give it that much credit. The first thirty minutes were very well-done, if not severely predictable, like the rest of the film. The animation is well-done, if not average for the bar set by Tim Burton animated movies. The animation does have a slight unique rag-doll quality that was pretty cute for the first ten minutes. Some of the sub-plots are very interesting to watch. But none of this makes this memorable. It will pass time without too much problem, but it's nothing you're going to remember the rest of your life, because, as I said, the story is so unoriginal.I realize this review is going to be unpopular, and, quite honestly, I don't care. I have standards, and I'm not going to lower them just because this is a children's film. I've seen countless children's films with originality and real imagination, but Coraline just doesn't have any. It's generic coming-of-age horror with a generic character and a generic moral that you've heard in fairy tales before you were old enough to talk. So, really, what's the big deal? What is everyone raving about? Even if you were to only focus on the positive, it's hard to ignore that hollow feeling in your gut. The one that comes when you realize the movie you think you enjoy is just another generic rehash. That certainly isn't the magical feeling you're supposed to get when you watch children's movies, now is it? 3/10",3,22,58,7 February 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Uninspiered.
","Am I really the first negative review for this movie on here? That's pathetic.It was just stale.The beginning brought my level of hope for this movie up pretty high, and the sleek new zombies were pretty amazing. When the zombie action and scare scenes actually happened, there were simply some of the best I've seen on film.Too bad action and scares only happened for 20% of the movie, and even that might be a little high. The majority of this film was just stale, boring dialog with some comedy thrown in. I thought the comedy bits were pretty well-done, but they didn't fit. At all. I think the scariest part of this entire movie is the main menu.I just can't give this movie a positive rating because I've seen this movie done before a hundred timesbut done right. Parts of the movie reminded me of Cloverfeild, which kept the mood and setting without the pointless dialog. Parts reminded me of the video game Dead Rising, which had complete and total zombie mayhem and massacre, whereas this movie didn't come close.I'm not even sure this was worth watching once because it is so dull.0/10",1,11,24,2 September 2008
12 Monkeys," What was the point of that?
","I love weird sci-fi movies. I love plot lines that make no sense, and scenes that take insane amounts of imagination to even comprehend. Unfortunately, being someone born and raised on Twilight Zone episodes and old 50's and 60's sci-fi movies, I think I've seen every sci-fi plot that has ever been used. Maybe that's why I found 12 Monkeys just downright predictable in every way. And I'm sure if you're like me, and you've seen most of what the genre has to offer, this isn't going to thrill you or make you think any more than a children's cartoon with a space ship episode.Good: <ul><li>12 Monkeys had quality. It took it's time to make everything it did and said believable to watch. That is something that is missing in a lot of newer sci-fi movies, and it's refreshing to see it here.</li></ul><ul><li>Some neat images. Nothing groundbreaking or genre-defining, but there is a lot of sci-fi imagery that is pretty cool to see on film.</li></ul>Bad: <ul><li>The acting isn't completely horrid, but it's so over-the-top and sometimes and sometimes downright cliché that I couldn't help but smirk at most of it. Bruce Wills acts like a complete retard in some scenes, and a macho action hero in others. Brad Pit is ridicules.</li></ul><ul><li>Cheese. I'm sorry, but the camera angles are pure and utter cheese. I assume it's meant to be childish purposely, but with a movie like this, it just takes away the ability to even care about anything. Likewise, the music is horrible. I can understand the monkey theme song, fine. But was it really necessary to have cartoony classical music to boot it? Come on now. Also, there is an unnecessary amount of male rear nudity that, once again, takes away any seriousness. You put a guy's butt in a serious movie and it's always a way for the audience to ask: 'Wait, is this American Pie?' </li></ul>Typical: <ul><li>The story has been used so many times in so many different movies/books, what was the point? I guess this is the first time the screwed-up-time-travel plot hit the mainstream big-screen, but it has been used in so much more things before it, it's almost like a slap in the face when you get to the heavily clichéd and predictable ending. There are a few points of semi-originality scattered throughout, but what makes the difference? Go watch two random episodes of The Twilight Zone (from the 60's, might I add) and I can guarantee one will make you think: 'Hey, wasn't that also the plot from 12 Monkeys?' I don't know how anyone can find this confusing; it's just run-of-the-mill. Average at best.</li></ul><ul><li>The romance spin was so cliché I found myself wondering if it's even possible to have an American movie without a romantic subplot. Ben Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation says it best: 'What if in some parallel universe every movie had to have a subplot where people square danced? That would be absurd, right? It's no different than EVERY last American movie having a random romantic subplot. It's absurd and pointless.' </li></ul><ul><li>The slow pace builds quality, as I said, but that's also a major problem: 12 Monkeys is slow. I fell asleep during the middle and had to finish it the next day. The majority of the movie is boring talking scene that say things you figured out from the first trailer.</li></ul>Overall: Really, was it necessary to make this movie? Sure, it had some quality and maybe it was a little out of the ordinary back in 1995, but those are the only two reasons 12 Monkeys didn't get a 1/10 from me.If you consider yourself a true sci-fi fan, there is no reason to watch this. If you're just an average joe, you'll be bored out of your mind. So, really, why all the positive reviews? I just don't get it.1/10",1,27,72,30 October 2008
Hostel," Beats 'Battle Royale' where intelligence is concerned.
","First of all, let me say that contrary to what reviews are stating, this is possibly one of the most intelligent horror movies out there. While foreign horror movies like Frontier(s) get perfect ratings because of they're not the norm here in America, thus SEEMING superior, they lack the intelligence that this lower rated movie had.Hostel is essentially a parable. The movie is divided into equal 45-minute halves that both parallel in every way, except they have different subjects: sex and violence. From the scenery to the events, they're pretty much a mirror imagejust reversed. I'll talk about both.Sex People complain about (or enjoy) the nudity, calling it semi-porn. Being someone who really doesn't like nudity in films, I can say that it isn't quite up to porn level because it simply pretends to be porn. You can decide for yourself if that justifies it as being porn or not, BUT, Hostel uses nudity for a reason. I think one of the strongest things the film has going for it was to back up the point that all naked women are the same. Porn, your wife, some whore, your daughter . . . all the same. It showed that amazingly well through the nudity. I think I was most impressed that it used the nudity for a reason, unlike other movies.Violence Whoever says this is more violent than any of the Saw movies, please tell me you're joking. It roughly is just about as violent as the first Saw, but after that the Saw franchise makes this look babyish. There are cut-off scenes, scenes that simply show NONE of the gore on screen, scenes where it doesn't show the graphic details. In no way shape or form way this pushing gore on screen. If they took out about a minute more of it, I'd honestly say it could have gotten a hard PG-13 because it uses PG-13 strategies to try NOT to show the gore. But intelligently, it uses the violence to mirror the sex and make its point.Overall, it had a trite, almost cute, way to wrap the entire movie up. 'I got some pussy the other day, but I don't even remember what color her tits were, man. But THIS, this I'll remember forever.' When given the opportunity, violence replaces sex.I've seen a lot of movies that pretend to be smart. No Country For Old Men was one of them. But those kinds of movies aren't smart simply because they lack anything new to saythey repeat trite clichés. Death, love, blah, blah, blah. And though Hostel lacks any kind of a plot twist, I think the major twist was that it DID have something original to say about the correlation between sex and violence. It said something about human nature I've never heard before.In the end, it feels almost like Saw's brother. They're utterly different but somehow linked by similar gore and their morals. I'd take this over yet another tired old man movie that thinks it's so intelligent but just repeated a cliché, like There Will Be Blood, any day.9/10",9,1,3,1 September 2008
Oldboy," I give up. Trying to show people how cheesy/unoriginal this movie is can't be done.
","Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature. I'll never understand how critics can trash a Hollywood blockbuster for being cliché, then hail movies like Oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so. Regardless, Oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *Spoilers* Man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *End spoilers* Simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from Greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, I laughed out loud. Does that mean I'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? No. What it means overdone plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved that, and Oldboy proved it as well. Why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? That brings up the issue of blood/gore. Simply put, it isn't there. The director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something 'gory' happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I've heard Oldboy called the 'most brutal movie of all time' and 'the most disturbing movie ever' but when I watched it I failed to see ANYTHING even remotely gory or disturbing. All the 'gore' is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why this even got an R-rating confuses me, much less 'the most brutal movie of all time'. Seriously, I've seen movies that just make Oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.The other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. The majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic American Pie-style, but I'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? When he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad Asian mix of the cheesiest James Bond villain mixed with something out of Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. Seriously, Oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .In the end, Oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. It's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the 'films' (never 'movies') they enjoy are.To those people all I can say is this: I like 'films' and also like 'movies'. I like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. But the thing is, for me to like both 'films' and 'movies', they have to be original. They have to be something I haven't seen so many times I lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. When something isn't original, it's expendable. If it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. Before you give Oldboy yet another perfect rating because it 'touched' you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? I just wish someone other than me would understand this.Overall: Oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.1/10",1,23,54,26 September 2008
The Prestige," Let's watch middle-aged men talk for 2 hours! That sounds SO fun!
","There is something Quentin Tarantino always says that I couldn't help apply to The Prestige. In a lot of interviews, he mentioned that most movies anymore aren't even stories, but rather a single circumstance that the director just lives up to for two hours. And that's exactly the problem The Prestige and every other Nolan film has. Nolan just takes one boring concept, then attempts to stretch it out into a long-winded, boring movie by use of his watered-down metafiction directing style. If The Prestige would have been the idea of any other director, they would have at least added SOMETHING to the one-track story or cut it down to half the time so it would have at least been slightly less tedious to sit though.The Prestige opens up with the single least interesting first hour I've ever witnessed in a film. Is there anything whatsoever that was even remotely meant to hold my attention? From the severely uninteresting opening, the movie tries hard to redeem itself with a middle 'twist' that is too shallow to be called a true plot twist. Simply put, it's a weird sci-fi insert and nothing more. I have nothing against that, but one semi-interesting plot point can't save a pointless movie from being pointless. By the predictable ending, all the scenes that made no sense before make sense. I assume this is a style Nolan finds clever, but it got old after Memento. In The Prestige it's simply annoying, if not a bit childish. It's used here as a way to force an uninteresting plot into something that is watchable by indulging the viewer in cliché mystery. And I predictable and analyzed everything I just said above in the first ten minutes alone. Ironic, isn't it, that Nolan tries so hard to unpredictable but the very storytelling method he uses gives himself away. Christopher Nolan is a lot like an immature little kid trying to impress an old magician with a cheap coin trick. It's amusing and cute at most.The other main problem with The Prestige is it lacks anything whatsoever even slightly original. The one-line plottwo dueling magicianshas been used in everything from multiple CSI episodes to cartoons like Scooby Doo to old classic horror Hitchcock Presents episodes. The sci-fi insertI won't spoil what it ishas been done before in other movies time and time again. The dramatic scenes are all as cliché and predictable as possible. All the fanboys who are calling The Prestige even remotely original really make me laugh.The acting is decent on all fronts, and sometimes borders on cheesy when some of the actors forget their accents half-way through. The directing is somewhat stylish, but nothing that held my attention or is anywhere above average.But above all, the main flaw is by far the fact that 2/3rds of the entire movie is irrelevant to the plot or to anything whatsoever. It's just a bunch of old men repeating the same lines about magic tricks over and over to the point of nausea. I don't have the strongest attention span, but I can certainly sit through a slow-paced movie when the slow pacing actually has something to do with the story. For example, the original 1970s Alien had a complete hour of seemingly irrelevant screen time, but it used that to build atmosphere. Here, in The Prestige, you have an hour and a half of screen time devoted to nothing but hearing old men talk about things that make no difference. It doesn't build atmosphere; it bores. I was already screaming, 'Does it EVER end?' at the screen before I was even halfway through, and that is simply ridicules.Overall, The Prestige is a completely pointless watch because you've seen it all beforein half the time. It's cliché, painfully boring, and ultimately pointless: all staples of Christopher Nolan's film making.0/10",1,20,53,17 December 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Pretty cool, just a little forgettable.
","I sincerely hated Pan's Labyrinth with a hardcore passion. The clichés, the copy/paste story that has been used on every fantasy work from Mythago Wood to episodes of the dead cartoon Chalk Zone, the boring war scenes . . . what about Pan's Labyrinth was there NOT to hate? Likewise, the del Toro produced cliché-in-a-house movie that was The Orphanage made me lose all hope del Toro had any potential.I've never seen the first Hellboy. This was the first slightly original work I have ever seen from del Toro. Without the insanely boring, pointless scenes that Pan's Labyrinth had, and with much more focused action, Hellboy gave me hope del Toro can use his potential. The man has always has amazing visions and philosophies, but until now I wasn't sure he could use them. Thank God he proved me wrong.The movie is very far from perfect, and parts were a little too intentionally cheesy for me, but it works. It awes, it has some terror, and has some amazing over-the-top action. It really made me feel the same way I felt with all the old children's fantasy movies like The Dark Crystal and The Never Ending Story, but with a much more mature focus and presentation.I can now say del Toro has made a movie as great as the way he thinks.2/10",2,2,6,2 September 2008
Cloverfield," True survival horror.
","I hate clichés. I hate when Hollywood takes a story that everyone has known since they were old enough to use the toilet and people think it's utterly amazing. As far as horror movies go, that includes everything from Disturbia to Sweeney Todd. I am shockedREALLY shocked to say that list does not include Cloverfield.Yes, you've heard the story before. (Well, as far as this movie goes, that is. Who knows what the final plot will end up being.) But when it comes to this movie, really, who cares? The only thing I can compare the way this movie made me feel to was the original Alien. The characters were as realistic as really being at a real party. The camera just simply adds yet another added layer of realism. The plot was realistic, as I would have done nothing different than the main characters. I never once would have thought I would be writing the word 'Hollywood' and 'realism' anywhere near the same sentence.The whole adventure is just awesome when I look back at it. I feel like I just witnessed some of the coolest scenes ever captured on filmthe bridge, the helicopter, 'We have a bite!', even the party.I'll never think of movie intensity the same way again.10/10",10,3,5,31 August 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Eh, that's pretty cute I guess, but nothing else . . .
","In the sad little world of close-minded people who sip fine wine as they watch 'films' but never 'movies', Dr. Strangelove is a timeless classic. To the rest of the world (who actually have friends and watch 'movies'), Dr. Strangelove is nothing more than a somewhat amusing movie, and that's it. I think Kubrick himself never intended it to be anything but the latter.I don't judge movies on their importance to cinema. If I did, any movie over fifty-years-old would have to earn a perfect score, despite what I actually thought of it. I think that is a cheap, dishonest way of reviewing. With that said, I am a fan of Kubrick, and I still found little in Dr. Strangelove that was worth viewing. The actually humorous moments are few and far between, and are almost always dry jokes that would make your grandfather laugh, but do nothing to the generation desensitized by American Pie and Superbad. Maybe Dr. Strangelove is simply a generational movie, which I could understand. I don't expect the next generation to love the same movies I love now.So what makes this movie deserve the score I'm giving it? For one, the boring factor. The movie is an hour and a half, but it felt more like five. Scenes drag on to the point of ridiculousness, trying, I assume, to flesh out the paper-thin plot. There is barely enough content here to actually make a short film, much less a full-length movie. The characters all just seem like cartoon gimmicks, only there to drive the plot. The characters aren't like the characters in Pulp Fiction where they're realistically absurd, they're just absurd. And that gets old fast.Also, there is nothing here that other war parodies haven't done before it and done better. The only difference here is that this one has a big-name director, whereas the others didn't. You've seen most of these jokes before countless times. Even the ones you haven't seen countless times are smile-worthy at most.The 'genius' of making a parody where we march happily to our own execution is really nothing special either. What else is there for a war parody to do? It takes little imagination whatsoever, even for 1964. Political cartoons did it years upon years before that date. That's why when I say there is very little, if anything, truly original or creative about Dr. Strangelove, it's overshadowed by the countless parody clichés. Does that mean it's less amusing? Yes. When you hear a joke more than once, it's hard to laugh at it again.Overall, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is just a Disney cartoon done in like action with a prolific director at the help. Nothing more. Nothing less. The hype is absolutely ridicules, and I don't care how many 'not helpful' votes I get for this. Someone needs to realize these pretentious 'classics' aren't classics at all. They're boring, pretentious English essays with little to differentiate them from the countless others just like them.Stanley Kubrick did much more important works in his lifetime than this.3/10",10,8,18,12 December 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," How do people NOT find this typical?
","Sometimes I wonder if critics even notice anything except the cinematography. I mean, I think I could film someone killing a guinea pig, but if it were filmed with a beautiful camera the critics would love it. Because other than nice camera-work, this movie has nothing going for it. And I mean NOTHING.First, I'll start with the boring factor. This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen: no doubt at all. DO NOT think this is a fantasy movie like Lord of the Rings mixed with Saw-like violence. There are literally only 4 fantasy scenes, and each last maybe 10 minutes tops. The rest of the movie is nothing but boring conversation.Secondly, I was told by countless people this movie was violent. And trust me when I say this: if you've played any T-rated video game, you've seen more violence in 5 minutes than there is in this entire movie put together. It did not even earn its R-rating, much less be considered a 'hard R' as I was told. Also, the violence is NOT in the fantasy sequences, it's in the war sequences . . . which made it seem like a toned down (but darker) Saving Private Ryan. And that's not a good thing.Third, the cliché factor. It is falsely called an 'original' movie by critics. I'm sorry, but there is nothing to see here that you haven't seen in PG-rated movies like The Chronicles of Narnia or E-rated games like Zelda. The ending was such a cliché I wanted to slam my fist into the TV because I was so disappointed.So why do I give this movie a 2 and not 0? Because as much as I hated the movie itself, I agree strongly with the idea behind it: fairy tales are bloody, dark, and for adults as well as children. Guillermo Del Toro failed miserably with this movie, but with his ideology, his skill, and his memories of a traumatized past, I know in the future he can make something that is truly stellar.But don't expect this to be that movie. Try again, Guillermo.4/10",4,5,13,31 August 2008
Alien," Really, what can I say? It's perfect. That's all.
","When I first watched Alien I simply did not have the attention span to sit through it. That's the same story as pretty much every one-star review you'll ever read. They, and likewise I when I first watched it, watch the first hour and realize nothing has happened and turn it off. I remember saying, 'Who can open up a movie in such a boring way?' But after turning it off after the first hour, I came back later and finished it upand was amazed at the pure intensity of the last half hour. I didn't realize what I was supposed to realize in the first five minutes: everyone on this ship is already in a life-or-death situation. That is why it is called a survival horror movie. That's the pure genius of the slow opening. That's what I and all the people who think this movie is boring missed. Luckily, after finishing the last 30 minutes the first time I realized this and watched it again. And again.The atmosphere and feelings of true desolation were a perfect execution of the brilliant tagline, and to this day I'm hard pressed to think of another movie that rivals Alien in pure doom atmosphere. But with doom always comes melodrama, and the casting and acting both diminish it.Alien also succeeds in perfectly placing the two shock moments. It knows how to use them to their most effective potential, with flawless execution, by using the slow pace to deceive you. If you have not seen this movie or any of the spin-offs, do not let anyone ruin these moments for you.But simply the main standing point that sets this movie apart from every other movie about aliens is the creature itself. In modern movies, creatures are thrown in with little thought or design, and Alien may be the single only creature film I've ever seen with a creature is not laughable in any way. Instead of stooping the stupid idea of making a humanoid alien that can talk, think, Alien defies the clichés by creating the most perfect instrument of death ever filmed, ever thought of, and has never yet been rivaled.I don't what else there is for me to say. Alien is a true survival horror movie that not only started the sub-genre but puts all others in that sub-genre to shame. There are no pointless sex scenes to make you realize you're watching yet another tiresome, typical Hollywood horror movie. No pointless subplots or gimmicky action scenes. Alien is true, simple terror that copies real life rather than copy other movies to make money.",10,1,3,4 September 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Boring and pointless.
","Like always, I don't understand the rave reviews for this movie.It was hardly anything special. Yes, the acting was amazing. And yes, the style was great. But anything worth giving this movie a perfect rating over stops there.When I (was forced to) watch The Phantom of the Opera, I couldn't stop thinking: 'I have scars, but do I make a lame musical about it?' With Sweeney Todd, it was: 'Revenge is a bad thing, we have seen that in a hundred movies already, why another one?' I don't get why movies simply can't just think of some lesser-used moral to center a movie around. (Or the original opera/musical, for that matter.) A moral that people can use. Have you ever honestly thought about killing someone for revenge? If so, you're by far the minority, and I seriously doubt a movie about a barber is going to change your mind.My second complaint was the blood. I'm all for over-the-top unrealistic style of blood splatter, but this just didn't impress me. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to laugh at it in this movie, or if the makers actually wanted me to take it seriously. It was just one of the most pathetic attempts at the style I have seen in a movie yet.Finally, I was bored to tears during the first hour. Nothing happens. I about turned it off because the singing was so annoying and typicalI felt like I was sitting through The Phantom of the Opera all over again.Overall, just a typical revenge movie. Nothing more, nothing less. I'd take Death Sentencewhich has the same moral, but much more entertainingover this any day, however.5/10",5,0,1,31 August 2008
Taxi Driver," The pacing is literally more retarded than the main character.
","In complete opposite mentality of Taxi Driver, no one challenges things anymore. If a movie wins a few Oscars and is labeled as a 'classic', the title sticks and everyone must bow down to it. If someone challenges this titleeven so much as asks, 'Why is it a classic?'they're ironically turned into a laughable fool by fools laughing. The paradoxical problem with this is that no one can really defend the so-called classics. All you ever hear in the defense of films like Taxi Driver when criticism arises is a list of the film's awards, or a list of the film's critical acclaim, or just, 'It's a classic, so shut up!' There have been far more original, thought-provoking, well-made movies that never even get the public's attention, much less won overrated Oscars. When people challenge the so-called classics with this fact, the notion is never entertained, and oftentimes foolishly laughed at or stupidly dismissed as childish or immature. With everything I just said as a backbone, I'm about to challenge the 'classic' Taxi Driver. If you're open-minded you'll give this review a chance. If you have the arrogant mentality of a whiney 4-year-old'It's a classic, that's all there is to it!'then don't even bother reading any further. There is no hope for your immature intellect.First and foremost, Taxi Driver is not a completely worthless film. I'm not even going to try to argue that. It has had had a major influence on the way open-world movies and video games have been made, and possibly even invented the subgenre. Taxi Driver creates a realistic world, fills it with faceless scum characters, and openly lets the main character interact with them in a completely non-linear way. Some people find this completely boring, others find it completely genius. The entire film is hinged on if or if not you can emotionally relate to the main character. If so, these opening scenes of him interacting with his environment will likely captivate you. If not, these scenes will likely put you to sleepevery single time you attempt to watch it. Stating and argument on whether or not Taxi Driver is boring or not is completely pointless because it's completely opinion-based. Personally, however, I was bored out of my godforsaken mind until the last thirty minutes of the film. Movies have presented loneliness much better, in much more effective ways than this. Another 70s film, Straw Dogs, for example, examines realistic human emotion with much more depth.DeNiro's acting is average at best, unless you're really studying so closely it's ridicules. If DeNiro wasn't so famous, no one, not a single review, would even mention his acting whatsoever. The character he plays is also completely average. Some people state that he has mental disabilities; if so, I didn't even notice. He was an average, typical, lonely character and nothing more. The majority of his time on screen he's staring at the walls or staring out his windshieldthat's not psychologically deep, it's typical. There is nothing, not one thing, psychologically deep about the main character. It literally makes me laugh every time I hear people calling the character of Travis 'one of the most accurate psychological characters ever portrayed'. If so, Napoleon Dynamite is the next Freud. Neither Travis nor Napoleon do anything whatsoever except stare at things. And we all can learn so much about the human condition from that.An actual story doesn't even develop until the last thirty minutes of the film. Though it is somewhat nostalgic, it's a pretty typical example of 70s 'shock value' that is about as shocking to us today as watching a dead tree stump rot. At least it didn't have a cliché, non-graphic rape scene like the hundred other 70s movies just like itI'll give Taxi Driver that credit. The final action scene is PG-13 at worst by today's standards, but it does give some much-needed diversity to the film. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the structure of Taxi driveropen-world, followed by a mini subplotwas a pretty fresh and creative idea for its time. It's almost prolific, considering the thousands of movies and video games that came out after it with the same style. But it's executed terribly here. Travis just repeats the same lines. He never really examines human nature or human behavior. It just gets old fast. The writers could have done so much more with this formula, but their lack of creativity and imagination is absolutely ridicules.Overall, while the formula Taxi Driver follows is essential, the overall film is bland and forgettable. There were so many missed opportunities to bring true depth and insight into the film, but the writers didn't take them. The lack of any story at all gets very annoying very fast, mainly due to the average main character, played with an average performance. But I guess that is the moral of this non-story that all future directors should take note on: meritocracy wins over the imaginationless critics. And spineless viewers agree with every word they say.4/10",6,1,4,1 February 2009
Corpse Bride," Can't there ever be a animated movie that sustains a darkly beautiful tone?
","I'm not a huge Tim Burton fanSweeny Todd was decent, but that's all I can really give himand I've never seen The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I can't compare this to it. If you're looking for an unbiased review, this is one of the few you'll get.First of all, for an animated movie, this is one of the better ones I've seen. The themes running though are not overdone clichésunlike, say, Wall-Eand it was very nice to see women in an animated film fighting for the man, and not clichéd vice versa. The plot line itself is something similar to what you'd read in a kid's horror anthology, but it totally worked for this film's style. More importantly, the plot isn't something you've heard a thousand times, and I couldn't pick out any glaring clichés. In a way, The Corpse Bride is more mature of an effort story-wise than some of Burton's live-action, R-rated films because it has more imagination.The signature Gothic style is done very well, and the animation is stellar to look at. I found the use of black-and-white in the real-world sequences a bit annoying and overdone, but to each his own. For someone who isn't a hardcore Burton fan, I can't say I really even noticed the music. Every now and then I thought it was pretty, but I doubt if you're not paying a lot of attention you'll even notice what everyone else is deeming as 'beautiful and a masterpiece'.The main problems The Corpse Bride had: - Most of the characters were forgettable. They play out flat, as if the plot is just using them as pawns. I wouldn't mind this if the plot was AWESOME, but it just simply isn't, and the lack of emotional attachment to the characters really gets in the way of the overall effect.<ul><li>No immersion. I understand this is a children's movie, and being an adult may have something to do with it, but as hard as I tried to love The Corpse Bride there was just something dull about it that I can't put my finger on. The world Burton creates is a near-perfect mix of childish macabre fantasy, and it is beautiful, but there is something missing. I assume that would be a darker plot line. The constant use of puns, also, takes away from the seriousness and beauty of the whole thing. Can't there ever be a animated, PG-rated movie that creates and sustains a darkly beautiful tone? Overall: Be sure to watch it on TV when the countless cartoon networks are playing it for Halloween. It is worth your time. It's just not the masterpiece I was hoping it would be.</li></ul>6/10",6,4,6,29 October 2008
Fargo," Manipulative to the audiencebut not how you think.
","It's hard to deny that the vast majority of cinemaAmerican or otherwiseis going to be ridiculously overrated by a certain group of people. When that group is the actual American population itself, a lot of negative reviews like to label the said film as 'The most overrated movie of all time!' The fact is, no matter if you or I like a film or not, almost everything gets more recognition than it deserves in America. Average movies are stretched out into 'modern masterpieces' simply because of the utter lack of creativity or originality in cinema overall. It's much easier to force yourself to feel contentment in something you just wasted your time and money on than admit it was terrible. It's a common misconception to 'look for the good in every film', rather than actually admit that you've seen/heard everything the film showed so many times you almost feel asleep or lost interest and made out with your girlfriend for 3/4ths of the movie, then call it a great film just because the critics did. Everything I just mentioned above could be the reason Fargo is so overrated. But if you want me to be honest, Fargo is so downright pathetic, no matter how hard I try, I can't figure out why it's overrated. At all. I just don't understand it.I've seen reviews calling Fargo everything from the best movie of all time to a Shakespearian masterpiece. I read their reasoning, and I found it flat. I've watched big-name critics rave about Fargo, but even they failed to give a real reason it was so amazing. Basically, they all come down to: 'Fargo was average, sure, but the humor gave it some life.' And if that's the best they can think of, by their own logic, SpongeBob should be rated alongside The Godfather.Based on a true story or not, there is nothing even remotely worth watching in Fargo. It has the same exact plot as you've seen on bad TV crime drams before, and it unfolds in exactly the same way. What's the point of making a movie about a true story if it's exactly like the countless fictional stories just like it? Fargo has no originality, and next to no creativity. Sure a few lines of dialogue are decent, but who really cares? Reviewing an entire movie based on a few lines is ludicrous. The dialogue and humor both aren't even that great. If anything, it reminds me of a severely watered-down Pulp Fiction wannabe.Likewise, the heavy use of nostalgia is the sole reason this isn't playing on the women's channel instead of being called one of the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers rely heavily on nostalgia and soft-spoken characters to give off the faux sense of seeing something you haven't seen before. I always hear people calling a movie 'manipulative' or 'and insult to my intelligence' due to a plot twist or something that they didn't see coming. Though I usually find those types of people unintentionally hilarious, I'm going to go as far here as to say that Fargo is manipulative to the audience: it uses nostalgia to mask that it's really a dull, hollow shell. The plot is completely throw-away. A guy pays to have his wife kidnappedand weren't we all oh-so-shocked when that went wrong? For once, I'd like to see a movie where something like this goes RIGHT and everything thereafter plays out exactly as planned. That might be interesting. Fargo, however, takes the boring, safe route and does exactly as expected of it. By the closing credits, I literally asked myself out loud: 'What was the point?' I think I figured out the point. The point the Coen brothers were trying to make was that you could make the most typical movie ever, add a couple funny lines, and they'll be basking in wealth because of it. They probably even had a good laugh at the level of positivity regarding their pathetic film. Because, really, no one tries to find the faults in films anymore, just the good in everything. May I suggest that this is why we're watching Fargo and not a truly original, captivating film from these two skilled directors? If you love their crap, they're not going to waste the effort making gold.1/10",1,9,24,13 January 2009
Predator," An action movie that actually has action.
","Sure the effects are a bit outdated, but who cares? The movie itself is possibly the greatest action movie of all time, and the horror elements can't be matched by 90% of what comes out today.Predator has just about as much gore as most modern movies, but it does something they have forgottenthe gore isn't something so generic you've seen a thousand times. Some of it, like the head on the stick, are so much more over-the-top than what films attempt today it's just amazing. At one point blood flies so thick it literally covers the screen for a few seconds! With 30 Days of Night, The Decent, and The Mist: why couldn't they at least show as much carnage as a monster movie that came out decades before them? Shouldn't we be pushing the limits of gore, not making more stupid cut-off scenes? Also, I'd like to mention the well thought out the movie is. Contrary to sucky copy/paste monsters in the movies I just mentioned, the Predators actually took some thought to design. They really, REALLY make most action-monster movies today look retarded. Really, at one time we had Predators (some of the coolest creatures imaginable), now we have ridicules talking vines that eat people (in The Ruins). Predator stands the test of time to show me that our generation doesn't have a single original idea in their cheese-filled heads that shout: 'No, this is too much gore . . . the audience can't handle this . . . we have to make another cut-off scene.' From beginning to end Predator is flawless. I can only imagine what it would have been like to view when it first came out, before all the surprises were given away and become part of pulp culture. But even for someone who has seen both AvP movies, thus knowing every surprise that this superior film has, Predator is still one of the most flawless action movies ever.5/10",6,1,7,3 September 2008
Watchmen," Watch me(n) care less.
","* Note: Yes, I read the graphic novel; no, I do not consider it perfection. This is not a biased Watchmen-comic fanboy review, nor a review from someone unappreciative of the original story.Adoptions and remakes are always severely patronized. When we view them, we always have an image of the original version laced in gold in the back of our heads, with the label of PERFECTION hanging over that image. When someone interprets that original version of a story into another field of art, or reinterprets it into the same field of art, we go in unconsciously thinking that there is NO WAY it will affect us as powerfully as the original did. This alone is stupid. If you look at past novel-to-film adoptions, a lot of them have far surpassed the original text. The biggest example is A Clockwork Orange. The original novel was just another cliché the-government-is-evil novel with a cute spin on morality tied into the ending. The film, however, nearly single-handedly created the surrealist genre in cinema and minimized a lot of the cliché plot points. Just because a movie is based on a novel does not mean it has to be bad. However, if there is a flaw in the reinterpretation, we say it's the loss of the translation, but we never stop and accuse the original version of that flaw, even if that's where the flaw originated. Viola, Watchmen.If there is anything the film version of Watchmen does, it shows the gaping flaws in the original graphic novel. Zack Snyder is taking a lot of critical trashingsome of which he deservesfrom the group of people who saw their nostalgic childhood memories/fantasies torn apart on the movie screen. But what that group of people fail to realize is that Snyder didn't change . . . well, anything at all, except the ending. He left out trivial scenes and bits of dialogue for the sake of time, but he pretty much copy/pasted everything in the graphic novel to the screen. That's something that can be proved on close examination of the two works. So there are only two reasons for people to dislike this movie: the actual story from the graphic novel, and the modern visual presentation.As I stated earlier, a lot of negative reviews from the fanboys are (correctly) trashing their beloved graphic novel without even realizing it. The biggest problem that is obvious in both the film and novel is that the underline story of the Watchmen is just seen-this-before. The graphic novel wasn't unoriginal in the sense than you could predict every plot point, but it was unoriginal in the sense that when you look back, you see how typical the grand picture is. In both movie and novel, the ending is the cheesy and predicable reversal-of-expectations that has been done for hundreds of years. It's something you expect from a 5th grade creative writing session, not something from a said-to-be literary genius like Alan Moore. A lot of other plot points were directly ripped-off of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits episodes. Even the so-called 'deep' themes are just clichés. You've heard them all before in high school psychology class. We understand the world is a bad place. We've understood it when we were 4-years-old and our grandmothers got ran over by a semi. Yet Moore carries his writing as if he's saying something completely new. Furthermore, the graphic novel and movie both reek of blatant immaturity. 1000-foot blue penises. Some of the most laughable costume choices ever drawn. The immature idea that something has to be laced with violence and sex or it isn't a mature piece of art. All the movie did was bring these flaws to the screen and expose them. These aren't Snyder's flaws, these are Moore's.Now for Snyder. First and foremost, Watchmen should have never been entrusted to him. Period. Watchmen should have been treated like The Godfather. Instead, it got the treatment of the Spider-Man 3 outtakes. As a visionary director, Snyder is perfect when he's working on movies like 300. He has an infinite amount of talent with brining style and freshness to generic action scenes that you've literally seen thousands of times. This is why 300 worked so well. 300 was a pointless action movie, and it never tried to be anything else. Watchmen is the equal opposite. The heavy themes or nihilism and pessimism are almost made laughable in the film version of Watchmen. It's as if Snyder couldn't decide if he wanted to be a pretentious old man or a crowd-pleasing hack. And he isn't experienced enough or talented enough to attempt both at the same time. Also, his overuse of CGI literally turns entire portions of the film into a bad Disney Channel cartoon. This is partly due to Moore's immaturity, but Snyder's CGI just emphasizes it to the point I felt like I was watching Horton Hears a Who more than once.As for the level of violence and sex: both were mild. The reason I mention it is because so many reviews are complaining about generic gore scenes, or a single breast shot, which I find downright funny. The average T-rated (13+) video game has more blood/violence than Watchmen^4. I can name several PG-rated films with more nudity. Grow up, folks.Every factor I just listed is why Watchmen fails as a movie, and is underwhelming as a novel. The movie does absolutely nothing but rip open the mild bleeding wounds the novel had. It dumbs down an already semi-unoriginal story. It takes the boring dialogue scenes in the novel and turns them tedious and impossible-to-sit-through. It takes the downplayed childish elements in the novel and parades them in front of the camera. It turns the stylish art direction of the novel into a cheap live-action cartoon.The Watchmen underwhelmed me in the first place. Now I just sit and laugh at them. Again: Grow up, folks.2/10",2,21,41,11 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," And the award for most typical movie of the year goes to . . .
","My only major problem with 28 Weeks Later is that there is nothing to separate it from the hundreds of other zombie movies, or in this case wannabe zombie movies, because the zombies really aren't zombies. Every single scene in this movie I've seen before. The virus-that-turns-people-into-zombies plot has been done more times than a dried-up hooker. And that is it. The movie doesn't try to take the sub-genre any further than it already was back in the 60s, and it doesn't attempt to add any intelligent twist to the formula. It does nothing that hasn't been copied and then copied again.What I just mentioned is why, even with all the well-done action, I really just wanted to turn 28 Weeks Later off and go to bed. It bored me because it was predictable, unoriginal, and exactly like the other zombie movies that bored me to tears. Yes, 28 Weeks Later is far superior to bore-fests like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, which had less zombie action than god-forsaken Juno. But at the same time, 28 Weeks Later bored me just as much because it copied scenes from that remake, and copied scenes from every other zombie movieI, and most likely you as well, have seen every scene in this movie before. Every last one. Any supposed intensity is zapped out due to this fact, because you know who is going to live and who will diethe scenes are that predictable.The other problem is the atmosphere. Or, more accurately, the problem is the fact the movie doesn't even attempt at creating a solid atmosphere, which would have helped it out a lot. The reason Cloverfeild and the original Alien were both so effective was because they understood how to create the perfect doom atmosphere. But while cliché movies like 28 Weeks Later will take up an hour of screen time to set up a drama behind the flat characters in order to give them characterization (which never works and didn't work here either), it never takes time to create atmosphere, which would be much more effective. There was no suspense. There was just the predictable: open with action, take an hour for drama, have the most action, then end with a cute, trite ending. So many directors/writers think that is the only way to develop a movie, but they're wrong. Let me repeat myself: they're wrong and cliché and pretensions and know nothing about good storytelling. I wish someone in the movie business would understand this.Technical aspects are amazing. The flash-cutting isn't done as well as in Saw, but it's a lot better than I've seen. The movie has one of the best soundtracks, and best use of its soundtrack I've heard in a long time. The style is also pretty cool. And, I'm shocked to say, this movie had enough blood to actually earn its R-rating, which made me happy. There isn't a whole lot of violence/gore, but what is there is very nicely done and bloody. It's sad, however, to see all these nice aspects go into such a pointless movie.Can no one take zombies and do something original with them? I can name several video games that have, but I guess movies are really just dying out.So, I bought 28 Weeks Later for $3 in the bargain bin. Was it worth that? I guess. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I was bored enough to shoot my eyes out.1/10",1,5,9,20 September 2008
The Thing," It's been a while since I've typed this line in a review: an old horror movie without cheese.
","Let me get this out of the way: I am not a biased fan of this movie. I did not grow up with it, I did not see it once, get scared, and then love it when I was older, and I did not watch it with any hype or weighted opinion whatsoever. I'm not really a John Carpenter fan. I am a hardcore horror fan who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer. I am an adult, and I watched this last night, 9/17/08. I'm not sure it's possible to find an opinion that is more unbiased than mine when I say: The Thing rocked.First and foremost, the reason The Thing works is because it does not bash your over the head with a block of cheese, unlike most 'classic' horror movies. Some of the effects are a bit outdated, despite what the lifetime fans would have you believe, but not so much as to look cheesy. At all. There is very little gorenothing that the average parent wouldn't let a 8-year-old seeand the gore effects are also outdated, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I just found it downright refreshing to watch a movie that didn't try to kick me in the balls. I've watched so many ultra-gory movies lately, The Thing made me remember what it was like when movies didn't use gore to make the viewer feel like crap, but instead used gore as part of the actual story. It's the perfect movie to watch on a snowy night with your girlfriend/wife or your kids.The reason The Thing isn't cheesy is because it submerges you in atmosphere and suspense and mystery, then it punches you. The creatures are not generic whatsoever, and some of them are downright weirdly awesome. (Spider-head, anyone?) The plot is pretty generic, if you can even call it a plot at all. Here is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it does something that you wouldn't expect: it doesn't really have a plot. No, The Thing is true survival horror. There is nothing here except the desire to survive, and that is the only plot. The opening scene hints that the creatures are aliens, but, really, the movie never says much about their origins other than that. Watching this movie is almost like watching people in an arena try to surviveyou don't watch it for the story. What makes The Thing original and different from the other movies like it is the small details, like setting, the creature designs, the characters, the ending, and so on.People who get bored with this movie don't understand suspense. I can understand that, because in the generation that we live in, suspense is dead and buried. Suspense has been replaced with either (1) lame action, or (2) lame dialogue scenes that 'build characters', even though the characters are pure clichés. Suspense is the feeling of 'I know everyone is going to die . . .' that you get before anything happens. I can count the amount of movies that get suspense right on one hand, but The Thing honestly pulls it off. If you're a fan of suspense moviesand no, I don't mean Wolf Creek, I mean like AlienI do not know why you haven't seen this movie already.Then there is one more thing I need to mention: The Thing isn't Alien. It never will be Alien. It is not quite as good as Alien, though it has more action. It is, however, the only movie I would ever mention in the same breath as Alien, because it does come very, very close.Overall: This is by far the best Carpenter movie I've seen, and one of the few movies I've ever seen that understands suspense. It's easily one of the best horror movies of all time, and I'm saying that as someone who find most 'classic' horror movies pure cheese. Watch this movie. Watch it now.9/10",9,5,9,18 October 2008
The Village," Best Shyamalan I've seen.
","It's unlikely that this movie will scare you, but I don't see how people can deny the amazing storytelling this movie has. It switches genres at least three times within the movie, and unlike The Happening, this isn't drawn-out or cheesy.The first twist comes mid-way and it is amazing because it is something most movies wouldn't dare to do. It's cliché-defying and different. When the second twist comes, the cheesy elements of the story all fall away and it turns into a weird thriller unlike anything I've ever seen.I get why people hate it based on their love for his older work. I totally understand that. But if you're a newcomer to Shyamalan with low expectations, this is probably the best of his movies to start with.5/10",5,0,1,6 September 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Decent horror fun.
","When I first saw The Hills Have Eyes, I thought it was one of the most perfect movies I'd ever seen. Obviously, my stance on that has changed, but I still think this is better than a lot of pretension time-wasters out there within the horror genre. I can understand why opinions on this movie would go in both good/bad directions, which I think is why I'm just taking the middle stance.First and foremost, this movie understands something it seems no one really understands anymore in HollywoodÂ—entertainment. Among the worthless movies out there today, you hear so much about the moral points a film makes, or the social commentaries, but those things are not entertaining or worthwhile. The Hills Have Eyes doesn't go there. It's pure entertainment.However, with that comes the cheesy factor. Mutants aren't exactly serious, but the film takes itself very seriously. I can see this making a lot of viewers think it's cheesy, but I was okay with it. I wasn't really okay with the fact this was just another overdone virus story that has been done a thousand times.The violence is decent. It's more graphic than the lame cut-away-scenes in Hostel, but not as over-the-top as it could have been and it was pretty generic.Overall, fun little horror flick. Nothing more, nothing less. Watch it with some friends, and don't expect a masterpiece, though I will say it was well-done.5/10",8,0,2,13 September 2008
American Psycho," Eh, whatever, let me go get some pizza. Did you do the laundry?
","If there is a single movie that suffuses as the poster-child for the countless 'What was the point of that?' movies, it's American Psycho. It's not necessary bad, it's just boring and pointless. It's the kind of movie that will leave the average person thinking about their laundry when the credits roll rather than the movie itself. In other blunter words, the movie is wholesale forgettable from opening to closing. If you know anything about real-life serial killers, or have seen any other cliché serial killer movie, you've seen this. Hundreds of times.It opens up just like every other first-person narrative movie, and some lines even made me wonder if they were copied directly from Fight Club. Regardless of when the two original novels were written, I think this just proves the insane unoriginality of both.Speaking of unoriginality, American Psycho is nothing but one long, bloated serial killer cliché with nothing to differentiate it from the countless others just like it. The main character is a mix of Hannibal Lector and your average no-name B-movie serial killer. He does exactly what every other serial killer ever does: kill, have sex, and kill having sex. He's a dull cliché with legs. (And a butt, if you want me to mention the constant immature use of rear nudity that has no point but to make the 13-year-old girls horny.) There is no real plot, just, as I said, kill and have sex, and that's the 'brilliant, masterful' plotting that everyone is speaking of. Kill, sex, kill, sexI think we know what sells in America. That's why American Psycho is just so safe. It's a safe idea that has been used hundreds of timeskill, sexand was destine to get great reviews because it plays so safe. I think we've learned by now that safe movies get the critic's good scores, and safe movies sell. Am I really the only one who gets it? American Psycho is a movie for safe pansies who's idea of a 'brilliant, masterful' plot is: kill, sex, kill.But with all the killing, I was left wondering: where is all this gore everyone is speaking of? How is this gory? Every single kill is off-screen. I've seen low-budget 60's horror movies that show more gore on screen. There isn't a single moment of brutality. There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama. Maybe that's because, no matter what you want to believe, American Psycho is a drama. It isn't a horror moviejust the idea of typing that makes me laughand it isn't an action movie. It's just a cliché, dull drama.The only good I can manage to scrounger up: - Bale knows how to act. - The chainsaw scene was interesting.Now, back to the bad for my conclusion. American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining. It's so forgettable the exact thing I thought when the credits came on screen was: 'I need to order some pizza . . .' and didn't even remember I watched it until I sat down to write this review the next morning. There are countless movies out there exactly like this, and I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person alive who even gets that there actually ARE interesting, entertaining, original movies out there to watch. Why did I waste my time on American Psycho? 0/10",1,12,32,2 November 2008
The Orphanage," I suggest watching a Japanese ghost movie instead.
","One of the most pointless movies I have ever seen.I do not understand the critics love. There was nothing new here, whatsoever. If you have seen The Grudge, The Ring, or any other Asian horror movie, you know exactly what is going to happen in the movieand the movies it ripped off. There are nods to everything from The Exorcist to The Shining, but the movie itself doesn't even live up to half the potential the movies it took its ideas from had.If it had come out 20 years ago, then it would have been decent. But after seeing a hundred other movies just like it, I don't see the point it was made. Clicking sounds coming from a little kid? The Ring mixed with The Grudge. Masked dances? The Shining. There was not a single scene in the movie that has not been in some horror movie before in some way. Instead of leaving the theater feeling scared, I left almost laughing at how unoriginal the movie was.And my last complaint was why on earth this movie was rated R. I've literally seen PG-rated movies with more violence and mature/disturbing content.If you have some weird desire to relive the same sad movie plot you've heard more times than even the predictable romantic comedy plots, watch this and maybe you'll come to see how predictable and bland your movie taste really is. If you want a genuinely scary ghost movie, go watch a Japanese movie like 'Dark Water' or 'Ringu'.1/10",1,18,37,1 September 2008
Wanted," Another boring action movie.
","I think the reason I don't like action movies very much is because they tend to be just dramas in disguise, and Wanted is nothing different. It's hard for me to remember an action movie that actually had actionsuch as in Aliens and Kill Billand wasn't just a Lifetime TV drama about how the main character has family problems and he tries to fix them . . . oh, and then his car blows up. Or in this case, he has family problems, he gets in a gun fight, and he tries to fix his family problems again.It's the biggest cliché in the book: a son tries to elevate to the level of his godlikeinsert one of the following: warrior/assassin/ninja/etc.father that died before he was born. That's how Wanted starts out, with the oldest cliché known to man, and from that point on it only delve deeper into cliché after cliché. I'm not even going to go into how unoriginal this movie is, it would take me pages, and even the dumbest person out there can sit there and realize they saw the exact same plot line in Star Wars and a hundred other movies as well. In my theater, at the point of the plot twist, I had to say under my breath: 'Luke, I am your father . . . ' It got more laughs from my row than any of the intentional humor in this movie.The rest plot is more ridicules than rip-off. I think when the writer realized how unoriginal his script was he had to think of the lamest 'original' idea he could: randomly selecting a name from a loom and killing the person. And we call old horror movies cheesy yet call this completely reasonable? As far as the characters go, every one of them is a cliché. Morgan Freeman is the cliché old man who makes ordersalso seen in every action movie ever conceived. Angelina Jolie plays the mysterious vixen with no more personality than a dying treealso seen in close to every action movie ever made. James McAvoy plays the unsuspecting looseralso seen in every action movie since the 70's. So, the characters and plot are worthless and boring, how about the action itself? The gunfights were the sole thing this movie did right. Well, that is until you get to the cliché slow-motion head shots that are no more graphic than images of someone throwing up red Kool-aid. It seems that any action movie that has come out after The Matrix uses slow-motion kills anymore, and the style is just as bland as it has ever been. Also, this is not a gory action movie at all. If you want a graphic action movie, go watch Predator or the unrated version of Death Sentence. But sadly I can't even complement Wanted on being graphic, because though there is a decent amount of blood on the floor, how it gets there is PG or PG-13 rated.In the end, Wanted is just as boring as every other boring action movie. I give it some credit for trying to be a little differentat least it's not another movie about terrorists again. But it fails in everything it tries. It fails at being thrilling. It fails at getting the manly-man message across about how men are boring like the main character was before he became a cliché . . . err, before he became an assassin.Oh the irony: it's more boring than it says the people watching it are.2/10.",2,13,21,6 September 2008
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypsenothing happensNow.
","* Just to get it out of the way: I viewed the Redux version of this film, and that MAY be the cause of some of my negative statements. I cannot say for certain either way.If you've ever been a member of a message board and you've read the thread about the last movie you watched, you'll know that 99% of the replies have one word or less beside the official score. For a long time, I wondered how that could be. I used to think, 'Don't these people have any more of an opinion other than 'good' or 'bad' or 'average'? They just wasted their lives watching a movie; couldn't they say more than just a score?' It took me a few months to figure the entire situation out, but when I did, it made perfect sense. Most movieseven good moviesare so predictable and unoriginaleven if they're enjoyablepeople still lack any real, definitive feelings about them. They see a movie on a Friday night and by Saturday night they forgot they even watched it. As a writer myself, I know first-hand there is nothing worse than an indifferent audience, but it seems that sums up most of the American population. Why? Because of films like Apocalypse Now.Apocalypse Now opens up with a semi-interesting beginning. It misleads the viewer into thinking that it actually has some physiological depth, then completely drops all depth into the gutter by the 10-minute mark and never picks it up again. Despite what you were lead to believe, there is no plot here. Or let me rephrase that: there is a plot, but it drops it after the 20-minute mark and never picks it up again until the final 30 minutes. Everything between those two points is exactly what you expect for a clichéd war drama . . .Talking. It almost amuses me that an 'epic' movie can have the flattest characters in cinema history, but the screenwriters always have them talk and talk as if they're actually interesting to listen to. In Apocalypse Now's case, the characters are ALL walking stereotypical war clichés with legs andunfortunately tongues. They're all simply nothing but dumb animals created to carry the pointless dialogue out. They talk so much it's downright nauseating. What are they talking about? I forgot, and I just finished the film 10 minutes ago. Their dialogue is all predictable copy/paste war dialogue; I do remember that much. Naked girls, guns, cliché monologues about life/deathall the stuff you've heard thousands of times. I was never a soldier in the Vietnam War, but I can pretty much assure you the real soldiers talked about more than these unimaginative movies give them credit for.Besides talking, what do you get in Apocalypse Now? Well, there are only two main action scenes in the entire movie, so you can cross balls-to-the-wall war action off your list of expectations. No, this nearly 4-hour long film focuses on shots of boats going down the river with soldiers talking, and not much else. There is no emotional experience here. There is no 'horror', as the tagline proclaims. The most 'horror' you get is a bunch of PG-rated war scenes and some eerie music as the soldiers move through fog. If the director had focused on the true horror of realistic war, I wouldn't have to be sarcastic when I say: How terrifying! Instead, however, the director focuses things we've seen before. Hundreds of times. He focuses on the copy/paste Hollywood-style war, not the truly gritty, dirty war. He doesn't rub your nose in the true horror of war; he pats you on the back and gives you generic conversation scenes.My point here: Apocalypse Now is one of the most boring movies even filmed. It's also safe and predictable, adding nothing whatsoever to the overdone war genre. It doesn't leave you thinking, 'My God, this is terrible!' It leaves you thinking, 'My God, I could have done the laundry with that wasted time . . .' And that's all. That's all there is to say about this nearly 4-hour long movie. The entire synopsis of every major event from open to close could literally be told in two sentences of text. Sometimes you have to sit back and realize that most award-winning, critically acclaimed, 'classic' films are nothing but hollow shells. They boast great acting and cinematography, but they have no story. No soul. No moral. No thrill. No point . . .This is why I blame films like Apocalypse Now for the indifference people have toward movies. These films are supposedly the best of the best, but at the same time they're completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't try their hardest to find pleasure in boredom in hopes of becoming an all-powerful FILM BUFF on some cheesy website. There is nothing wrong with being intellectual. There is something wrong with being pretentious and internally forcing yourself to love a film just because the critics do. And those are the only people who could give Apocalypse Now a perfect score. Or even a mildly positive score.0/10",10,82,160,26 January 2009
Disturbia," I've seen websites calling this the most unoriginal movie of all time.
","When Rear Window first came out, it was far from original. Now when Disturbia came out, it is nothing but a copy of an unoriginal movie, which leaves it being simply ridicules. What's even sadder is the foundation that holds the copyright to Rear Window is filing a lawsuit against Disturbia because they say it copies every single thing from Rear Window. I could have told you that from the first trailer. Why I even watched the movie is beyond me.The plot is so ridiculously cliché I don't know how it got past the producers, except for the fact that they know people like youwho gave this a high ratingwould watch it, love it, rave to your friends about it, and make them tons of money. Unoriginality sells, and that is just something I can't understand, even from the mainstream movie watchers. Don't you ever wish you saw something that wasn't predictable? Just once? I'm sure some of you have sat there in your easy chair, watching your dull, typical movies and thought: 'Hmm . . . I kind of wish someone would make a movie where the guy doesn't always get the girl and the killer doesn't always die in the end.' The acting was decent. Some of the movie was very well done, and sadly, better done than most original movies out there. Disturbia understands that there is really a fine line between horror and humor, and movies that take themselves too seriously just end up getting unintentional laughs. All this was great. My only major technical problem was that the killer looked like a reject from the Bozo the Clown show and I absolutely could not take him seriously whatsoever. Also, I was supposed to find the lead girl sexy and tempting, but she was downright average looking at best. So, the casting, minus the lead, was ridicules.Overall, Disturbia was pointless in every way. It's sad to see that so much of it was well done, but used on a plot that was a blatant rip-off of an unoriginal source. I left more enraged at the predictability than thrilled from the experience.1/10",1,7,13,19 September 2008
The Machinist," It's like they took A Beautiful Mind, scribbled out the title on the DVD, and wrote The Machinist.
","Before I saw The Machinist, if you asked me what the most predictable/pointless movie I have ever seen was, I'd most likely say A Beautiful Mind. Now that I have seen The Machinist, it easily takes that #1 most predictable, cliché, pointless rank because it ISno one can argue this, it ISA Beautiful Mind with a little less cheese, a little better lighting. To top it off, A Beautiful Mind was cliché and predictable when it came out, but The Machinist came out AFTER it.According to cheap Hollywood, the detention of 'physiological thriller' is as follows: a movie with a main character who has some sort of mental disability (but is smart), and then 'weird' things happen (which can be copy/pasted from episodes of The Twilight Zone if you have no idea how to be original) in his daily life, only to find out that everything weird was in his mind. For 'daring' directors, this could include the use of a murder that the character thinks his imaginary friend committed, but it was really him. If you still cannot think of a plot for yourself, just take the script from movies like A Beautiful Mind, Fight Club, Sev7n, etc., and copy it wholesale and change the character's names. Also, as a side note, a physiological thriller cannot be based on anything but multiple personalities and/or pink elephantsanything more original than that means your film will be destroyed by the critics and it will be too intelligent for the audience to understand.The paragraph above also doubles as the plot for The Machinist. Normal life, weird (cliché) stuff happens, main character finds out it's all in his head, end of movie. Can people just get over it already? If you didn't find The Machinist predictable and understand every 'twist' before they were revealed, walking down the street to get a cup of coffee must be insanely surprising to you.On a technical level, the film was flawless. Great atmosphere and directing. Pretty good acting from Christian Bale, and far superior to the acting in the films this movie rips-off. That's the only thing I can complement.The movie itself moves along at the slowest pace humanly possible. Boring daily life has never seen so much screen time. To call The Machinist boring is an understatement. I personally fell asleep around the middle of it and when I woke up I simply could not finish it until the next day. Nothing was happening, and in the end, nothing happens. There was not a single thrilling moment in the movie, no matter how much the raised volume of the annoying classical score wants to suggest.Some people are trying to say the film is great because of the moral value the ending suggests, but, really, it is nothing special or life changing. I can see a lot of people not even noticing that it tries to be moral with a positive ending.The Machinist in the end is a waste of time. I wanted so badly to like this movie, and I did for the first hour or soup until it turned to the most cliché movie I have ever personally seen. The movie would have benefited so much if it kept the same beginning, same ending, but just got rid of the clichéd 'mystery' that was no more mysterious than an episode of Scooby Doo. The Machinist is a copy of a copy. Maybe I'm the only one out there who is sick of movies like this, but, I'm sorry to say, this was pathetic.1/10",1,16,34,13 September 2008
The Exorcist," Well, at least I saw a girl talk like a hobo. That was entertaining.
","As a hardcore horror fan, who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer, it's a little weird of me to wait so long to see a 'classic' like The Exorcist. I think the reason was because I've seen so many faux masterpiecesthat include everything from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Suspiriathat I've given up hope in anything and everything that people claim to be a 'classic horror piece'. The Exorcist is no different.I assume that the hardcore fans of this movie either (1) grew up on it, or (2) were scared the first time they saw it, then build it up to be something it isn't in their mind, and if they were to see it a second time, I'm sure they would realize how boring and cheesy it is. I also assume there are some people out there who truly see this as a perfect movie, but I simply cannot come close to understanding their reasoning, and here is why: - Cheese. The voiceovers are downright HALRIOUS. At one point it sounds like the girl was trying to talk like a hobo or something, which had me laughing more than any comedy I've seen in the past year. Also, some of the dialogue may have been vulgar in its time, but now just sounds a lot like the script for a bad teen comedy.<ul><li>Boredom. I'd say that close to 80% of the runtime of this film has nothing to do with exorcism, but has everything to do with boring daily life that doesn't make me sympathize for the cliché, stereotypical characters, but certainly make me sleepy. There is literally no plot, and without a plot there is no suspense. I'm someone who finds the original Alien to be a fine movie, but the difference between The Exorcist and Alien is that Alien understands suspense whereas The Exorcist does not. There is a MAJOR difference between suspense and just downright pointless scenes, and The Exorcist fits into the latter.</li></ul><ul><li>Unoriginality. Yes, I can understand that The Exorcist was the first movie to bring exorcism to the big screen, but come on now. It is not an unknown subject by any means, and though this is my first exorcism movie, the subject just bores me because I know everything about it long, long before I watched it. It was like watching someone drink coffee to meI can care less because I've seen it so many times. I have read many books about exorcism that actually bring something original to the table, such as Ted Dekker's novel 'Adam', which is so far superior to The Exorcist it feels weird even mentioning it in this review. Exorcism with nothing else original attached was a bland, unoriginal subject in the 60s, and it's even more so in the 21st century.</li></ul><ul><li>'The scariest movie of all time' lie. I'll be blunt: this movie had me so board I was on the verge of fast forwarding if something didn't start happening. Calling this scary, much less 'the scariest movie of all time' is an utter joke. The cheesiness had me laughing, and the lack of originality and plot had me bored to tears. There was not a single scene in this film that scared me, or even came close. The stairway scene was a littlevery littlejolt of shock, but other than that, I've gotten more scared choking on food. I wouldn't even say this is even 1/10th as scary as a realistically portrayed exorcism. The majority was just intentionally hilarious. 'Oh no, it's a little girl possessed by a perverted hobo!' - Lack of realism. I've studied real exorcisms, heard firsthand accounts of them, and seriously, folks, this is a trip to Never Never Land compared to a real exorcism. The majority of the things the girl does are completely retarded, and no more based in realism than a tree is based in Jell-O. The 'Help me' scene just downright had to be THE absolute unintentionally funny scene of all time.</li></ul>Overall, I just want to say this: just because something is old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something is new doesn't mean it's bad. Just because some people got scared as little kids from a movie then grow up and label it a classic doesn't mean they aren't just as wrong as the kids who label Hostel a classic in our generation. If this movie were released today it would be laughed out of the theater. Age doesn't make up for the lack of entertainment or scares or thrills and cheeseit just makes something old. And usually boring.Watch the hobo-possession scene on YouTube and laugh your head off. The rest isn't worth watching.2/10",1,3,15,13 October 2008
Saw III," Incomparable.
","Oh. My. God.I've made it my life goal to see every horror movie (mainly every gory horror movies) ever made. By now I've seen about 70% of them. I can't remember the last movie that made me cringe, it was so long ago. You could call me so desensitized that even the worst of the worst gore puts me to sleep---literally.But then there is Saw III.I've seen all of the other Saw movies, including Saw IV, but I never say this one until now because my ex wouldn't let me. I already knew the story. I already knew most of the gore scenes . . . and it still shocked me.Unlike the boring, ungory Hostel: Part II, this movie is made for the MTV generation. It doesn't take time to characterize clichÃ© characters that could be copy/pasted from a hundred other movies, it doesn't start out slow and build 'suspense' that isn't suspenseful, it's pretty much pure intensity from opening to finishing.The gore is possibly some of the most intense gore I've seen in any movie to date. It's not as bloody as it could have been, but it's 1000x more brutal and creative than anything I've seen in any movie ever. And the lack of blood isn't because of a pansy director, it's because in the real situations there wouldn't be that much blood. Not to mention, this is one of the only movies I've ever seen where the camera does not blink once. No cut-off scenes, no pansy 'no show, but grueling sound effects! OMG!', the camera simply does not blink away from the gore. Truly pornographic gore. Thank God someone has balls.Gore aside, this has to be the single most intense movie I've ever seen in my life.Bloody-disgusting.com thinks the new The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is intense, but, sorry, this makes that look childish. This makes both Hostels look childish. It makes the other Saw movies, including IV, look tame. The ending is intense I cried. 'She didn't change! Because no one ever f***ing changes! No one is reborn!' The dialog, without any of the gore, alone makes the entire Hostel and Texas Chainsaw Massacre series combined look unexciting. I have simply yet to see a movie with more pure, unholy intensity.Saw III is possibly the most perfect movie I've ever seen. I'm not sure if I like it more or less than Saw II, but it's certainly close. Everything reeks of polish and genius, but still keeps the low-budget feel.Forget The Mist or The Decent or whatever horror crap you're watching: WATCH THIS MOVIE.10/10",10,0,1,30 August 2008
The Usual Suspects," I'm sure this title has been used before, but: The Usual Movie.
","Calling The Usual Suspects one of the top one hundred movies of all time, much less at number 20, is absolutely hilarious. I'm not one of those pretentious losers who think everything with even a pinprick of influence on cinema is gold, and I don't base my scores as such. Put simply, The Usual Suspects is nothing but usual. Typical. Average. Run-of-the-mill. There are a lot of insanely overrated movies, and this has to be in the top 10. Was the plot twist pretty clever? Sure. But, dear God, folks, I've seen a least fifty better, bigger plot twists before in (far superior) movies that the fine-cinema-whores (meaning, people who gorge on 'fine' movies and consider nothing else of value) wouldn't even consider because they aren't filled with average plots and two hours of pointless conversation scenes.The Usual Suspects, on a very grounded level, is nothing more than this. A movie made for kids who grew up watching Clue, then turned 12 and decided they needed something more 'mature'. The Usual Suspects is perfect for that situation. It really shouldn't be taken any more seriously than that. It's not a hard-hitting, mature thriller as some claim it is. And it certainly isn't the timeless, untouchable classic some claim it is, either. Most of the people making those claims likely haven't even seen a true thrillermeaning one that is actually fast paced and thrillingin their lives.Everything I just said above is why this is so average. It isn't a thriller at all, unless your definition of thriller is countless close-ups of men's faces and less action than an average soap opera. It's a drama. As a drama, the plot is your standard crime plot. Drugs, murder. How much more average can it get than that? Last I checked, drugs and murder were plots for average movies since the creation of the movie camera. You've seen it all before. The plot twist just twists and average story that I could care less about. Not to mention that if I were paying closer attention, and I wasn't, that I would have figured out the twist in the first half hour as a lot of people did. Even it is generic, even for its time.The directing and acting both add a layer of cheese to the movie. It reminds me of a kid's movie in a lot of places. Sure, the actors all played their parts well enough, but the cripple was a little over-the-top and the directing was just childish. The only thing I can compare the directing to is to how 80s cheesy slasher movies were directed. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. Close-ups galore and cheesy filter shots around every corner. That's another big problem I had.For those who insist this is a thriller, I read thriller writers. Dean Koontz and Ted Dekker write plots with just as big of plot twists as this movie, but their plots are not just the generic: drugs, murder. To me, who's seen infinity better plotting, this is nothing. It's a bowl of cereal. It's fun, it's slightly better than staring at the wall, but it's cereal; you know there is so much better out there to eat. Giving this a perfect score, or a near perfect score, just shows you have never experienced a true, original thriller with a true, original plot twist. And that most likely means you'll have to look somewhere other than the generic, critically-acclaimed top 250.2/10",1,8,15,30 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," It sad people honestly find this clever.
","I've written at least five reviews explaining why sci-fi movies everyone finds oh-so-original aren't original. Everything from 12 Monkeys to Déjà Vu, it seems there isn't a single sci-fi movie that can stand on its own two feet anymore. They all use tired, unoriginal plot lines that have been used over and over again on The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, if not both. It's just sad. The Butterfly Effect follows their example. But what makes The Butterfly effect even worse is that it it isn't clever like it thinks it is; there are so many plot holes, it's simply laughable to anyone who has enough intelligence to understand the plot of a children's cartoon. And I've seen plenty of cartoons that are insanely more intelligent than The Butterfly Effect.The Butterfly Effect opens with a cliché 'hook' that your 9th grade English teacher taught you about. A guy can change his pastI'm sure if I hadn't seen it a hundred other times, I'd be interested. From there, the entire first half hour you're force fed clichéssuch as a little kid drawing bloody picturesas the movie sets up the further clichéd plot . . .Boy tries to save girl. Who would have guessed? If he changes the past, he changes the future. If it were something that only a hundred other movies have done, not thousands, I may be slightly less sarcastic when I say: how creative! A 'psychological' undertone with no more intelligence than saying 'crazy people are crazy'. What movie would be complete without one these days? The problems I just mentioned are enough to earn the score it did from me, but from there the movie only gets worse. Minus Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart, there isn't a single actor in the movie who doesn't act with such an over-the-top vibe I laughed more than once. The cheesy dialogue brings the unintentional comedy even further. The cinematography is very amateur. What did the two directors do all day? It takes two directors to direct this terribly? Now for a taste of the major plot holes: - In more than one case, if he were to go back and change ONE variable to what he just did (ie: not stand by the mailbox) everything would have been fine. The writers must have realized this but thought it was too anti-climactic, so they decide to have him to contentiously try different pasts to get one right. Am I all the only one who finds this laughable? - Then there is the times the movie just downright lacks logic. One character is thrown in jail for . . . self defense? And there are plenty of other scenes just like that. Are the writers really that stupid? Did I mention the movie has the overall entertainment level of watching a tree stump die? Disregard whatever you thought this movie was going to beit's a stale, cliché drama and nothing more. The movie moves along at a medium-slow pace, and at some points it may even seem somewhat fast . . . until you realize it's just repeating itself. There is no entertainment value. Yes, I guess I can say it is somewhat compelling at points, but in the end what does it matter? It's forgettable. I watched it for the first time a day ago and I've already forgotten everything that I didn't write down in my notes to write in this review.Yet ANOTHER problem was the immaturity of the entire movie. Sure, I give it props for at least trying to be anti-politically correct, but it's done in a fashion that is just immature. Instead of actually making the anti-politically correct scenes a part of the movie, they're there for cheap shock value. I, personally, love shock valuebut when it's a part of the story. Not to mention none of the wannabe shocking moments (that didn't shock me) are off-screen because the directors obviously don't have the balls to actually make a movie that lives up to the R-rating this film received.Overall, I just see no point in watching The Butterfly Effect unless you were deprived of cartoons as a kid, because I've seen this plot used on every show Nickelodeon has aired. That's how immature and unoriginal it is. Some people will find the cliché boy-must-save-girl plot compelling, but, to those people, can I ask why? Maybe it's because you prefer safe, tired plots that have even less audacity than a cliché metal band writing lyrics about the nonexistence of God. As if we haven't seen either beforecountless times. And what bothers me so much about movies like this is how they always think they're so original, or so punk.The Butterfly Effect = pointless.0/10",1,9,28,7 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Not as bad as it seems . . .
","Some of the reviews of this movie make me laugh. It's like people are so mindless lately that no matter how amazing a movie is (and no, I'm not saying this is amazing at all) people will agree with the majority of critical reviews. Look at Pan's Labyrinth. The movie is easily the most unoriginal, boring, and just downright pointless movies I've ever seen in my lifebutit got a lot of perfect reviews and people follow the crowd and rate it the same. In opposite, this movie a lot of terrible critical reviews and people followed suit.Our generation is mindless.This movie is far from perfect, but the reasons people have for hating this movie are even more retarded: - 'PG-13! OMG! It sucks!!' Yet they fail to see that Alien and Aliens, if they were released in modern time, would have gotten a PG-13 rating. There was more violence/blood in the PG-13 rated Cloverfeild than Alien and Aliens combined. The level of violence in this movie is about the same as the original Alien, sorry to break it to you.<ul><li>'A Predator and human teamed up!' It's no worse than the cheesy laughing scene at the end of the original Predator. Oh, wait. I forgot. People want a carbon copy of things they've seen a million times to make them like something.</li></ul>I'm a huge Alien fan. The original Alien is one of my favorite movies of all time. As for Predator . . . eh.But Alien vs Predator was far from bad. It had enough action to keep me interested, which takes a lot. And the ending scene with the water tower was pretty cool, as well as seeing the Alien queen up and fighting. The minor plot twist in the very end was nifty as well.There is nothing here that should offend fans of either series, because it's more of the same, but with a twist. Perfect? No. Deserving of the mindless hate it's getting? No.4/10",4,0,0,2 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," I know old men who thought this was pointless.
","Let me start out by giving the number one flaw of this film. It gives boring movies a whole new definition. In reviews, I've said the phrase: 'Nothing happens in this movie, and I was so bored I fell asleep' a lot of times, but this time I mean it literally. The only people with the attention span for this movie are either old people or people who have no more liveliness than old people. If there is a more boring movie ever made, I've yet to see it. And I've seen a lot of boring movies. It sacrifices entertainment value for moral, and as far as moral goes . . .The other huge flaw is the fact that it also gives pretentious a new meaning. It's easy to see the people who made this movie expected it to be praised for accomplishing nothing, a lot like something a little boy does before puberty. And if there is anything to criticize this film on other than the boring factor it's the fact at how ridiculously immature it is. The directors think it is something so deep and intellectual, but in reality it is simply one of the most basic and clichéd 'meanings' or 'morals' a film could have: people grow old and die. That's it. That's the huge physiological moral this film thinks it's so intelligent for making. Really, guys, can you name how many times you've heard that one? In case you're having a hard time remembering, I've heard it in everything from Disney movies like Pocahontas to pre-teen movies like Holes to teen movies like movies for everyone like Star Wars to action movies like Death Sentence . . . (four hundred movies later) . . . and you'd think people would realize how cliché that 'moral' is. We get it. We die. Can't the directors think of anything, anything at all that is a little more original to bank on? But even worse than the fact it banks on such a cliché, the movie expects to be praised for it. It expects to put you in deep thought. It's no different than that 12-year-old boy thinking he can write a book on every bit of philosophy he knows and floor you with how genius he is.Okay, the other big thing the critics are raving about is the cinematography. Let me say this: it's okay. It's run of the mill. It's decent. It may be a tad above average, but you've seen better. Off the top of my head I can think of several movies with better cinematography that the critics hated, like Wolf Creek, for example. The acting, on the same hand, is pretty average. It was solid. It worked. But it is nothing to get all excited about! Javier Bardem, for example, did okay as your typical cliché 2-demnsional bad guy, but he certainly didn't deserve an Oscar. I can name several scenes where he looked incredibly corny. So, as you can see, where this movie doesn't go bad it just goes typical.As far as the plot goes . . . well, that's about as far as it goes. It's a plot. It's the basic plot they taught you back in middle school: guy wants something very badly, bad guy tries to stop him, and then in the end there is a confrontation. That's it. And I'm not simplifying itthat is literally the plot.Overall, the movie is just as typical as the critic-hated Disturbia. But here is something I've come to learn about the critics: they like things safe. They like plots that have been done more frequently than a slutty girl in high school with big boobs. They like typical, safe ideas and cliché morals that they've heard since they were kids. Anything that breaks that mold they trash because it's 'punk' and 'punk' is bad. As long as it's old, safe, and familiar it's good. If it's new, fresh, or original it's bad.I'm so glad I have more intelligence than critics like that. Hopefully you do too.0/10",1,14,22,2 September 2008
Batman Begins," The title should have been: Boredom Begins (and Never Ends).
","You can argue with my opinion until we're both nauseous, but you can't argue with numbers. That's why I did the one thing I never thought I would have to do: I literally timed the amount of pointless scenes in this movie. After the cliché 'hook' opening, there was literally no action for the first 38 minutes of the film. From there, you have a generic 2-minute action scene, and then from there Batman Begins goes into pointless drama (which I'll talk about later) for 22 minutes. That was when I was so bored I stopped timing. Either way, you see my point. More than 3/4ths of Batman Begins is completely irrelevant to the cliché plot (which I'll also talk about later). This movie is so bloated with dramatic cliché subplots and overstuffed with pointless dialogue, honestly, how is it even remotely considered and action movie? I've literally seen straight-out dramas with more action. This is the single, condemning flaw The Dark Knight had, and Batman Begins only elaborates on it to the point it simply isn't even watchable. It is so ridiculously boring and lacking in entertainment, it's a lot like watching a black piece of cardboard in the shape of a man get talked to, talked to, and talked to again for the 140-minute runtime. And none of that dialogue even has anything to do with the generic plot. Why do ACTION MOVIE directors feel the need to inject literally over 2 hours of inane dialogue into their 'action' movies? If there is a single movie that has ever been made that proves the action genreyou know, the one that actually has actionis dead, bloodied, and buried, it's Batman Begins.Aside from the boring dialogue that plagues the entire film from open to close, the viewer is bashed over the head countless times with clichés. Batman Begins uses even single parody-worthy dramatic cliché that has been used since the beginning of cinema. For example, the opening of the film shows Batman as a generic child with his generic childhood girlfriend, where he has a generic encounter with bats that later shapes his generic personalityall done with cheesy flash-cut directing. Instead of taking cues from the immensely superior (and immensely more original) graphic novels (such as Arkham Asylum) with Batman's back-story, Christopher Nolan does exactly what he does best: he uses clichés such as the one I just listed as an example. This trend is shown through the entire film to the point Batman was so trite and clichéd, he was more laughable than the Batman in the old 70s TV shows.The plot is exactly that: a plot. Bad guy vs. good guy. While this is a kindergarten concept to even the youngest viewers, it apparently wasn't to Nolan. It's an unwritten law in Hollywood: 'If you are working with a kindergarten plot, don't let the audience know it's kindergarten. Add some sort of flashy plot twist or cute spin on how you tell the storythat will throw them all off for sure.' No one, not a single director alive today, knows and follows this flawed law more than Nolan. If you look at his body of workfrom Memento to The Prestigethey all involve pathetic, unoriginal plot lines that he makes seem oh-so-'intellectual' through his cute metafiction storytelling. Instead of using that here, he does something even worse: he bloats and expands the kindergarten plot out to the point it becomes a self-parody. Batman Begins could have literally been told in 2 minutes, but with Nolan behind the camera, it takes over 2 hours. This is not suspense-building or characterization, this is straight-up being childish with the amount of utterly pointless scenes. It's a 3rd grader bloating out his 2-paragraph English paper to 20 pages just to show off. Or in this case, to win the acclaim of 'fine cinema'-whores who find anything less runtime-conservative than Gone with the Wind to be a waste of time. I'm so glad I have enough intelligence to see past that ridicules thinking.Other flaws: (1) When the action does happen, for a whole whopping 5 minutes, it's just as generic and dull as the dialogue. (2) Scarecrow is unintentionally hilarious due to his cheesy motives and lines. (3) This movie is NOT dark. It just rehashes old dramatic clichés, as I said. It's hilarious to me how movies like this get considered 'dark', and the mass media uses that in a good way, while truly dark films get critically trashed for being 'disgusting'. Either way, the only thing dark here is the use of dull cinematography. (3) Batman has as much personality as a black piece of cardboard. He runs around yelling, 'Stop! Stop, you bad person!' over and over again, and this is supposed to be the oh-so-awesome Batman everyone is raving about? He's serious, yes, but he's also cliché and dull and utterly the most forgettable interpretation of Batman ever envisioned. (Again, Nolan should have used the Batman character from the Arkham Aslyum graphic novel, which was both serious and had an actually dark personality without seeming like a piece of black cardboard.) Overall: Batman Begins is not watchable. It's sad so many people will settle for such a pathetic attempt to make Batman serious, ignoring every flaw. Let this be a lesson to Hollywood. You can't just take a black piece of cardboard, put it on film, give it a dramatic back-story, let hundreds of people talk to it about nothing important whatsoever, have a few people punch it, and call it entertainment. Well, then again, considering the success of Batman Begins, maybe you can.1/10",1,4,14,8 January 2009
Twilight," Liberate te ex inferis: save yourself from hell . . . by not watching this.
","The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clichéd and traditionaltwo things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.From the first scene to the last, at least 1/3 of every scene in the movie is filled with nothing but characters staring at each other or at various things. I've never thought I would have to sit here and actually type up a complete paragraph complaining about the amount of staring in a movie, but, folks, the day has come. Bella meets Edward: they don't talk, they literally just stare. The vampire plot point is reveled: they stare. Bella is in a life-or-death situation: she stares at whatever is about to kill her. At one point, a car is ready to crush her, and what does she oh-so-realistically do? Stare at it.The acting is that hilariously bad. During the majority of the movie Bella has a look on her face that is a mix between being high and having an orgasmwhile staring. Edward, despite what the horny pre-teen girls (and middle-aged women) want to believe, is a walking self-parody. Cheesy lines (that he repeats over and over again), unintentionally cheesy lines ('I'm so hot, and that makes me a perfect killer!'), and did I mention he's supposedly hundreds of years old yet he still acts like an angsty-creepy-weird-virgin-guy? So, how was the story? It's based on a novel, so it has to have a plot, right? Wrong. Put simply, vampire romance is the most unoriginal idea ever to hit literature. Not to mention movies like Near Dark and Let the Right One In already beat the overused plot bloody on the big screen. Essentially, Twilight in one line is: boy and girl fall in love, boy must sacrifice everything for girl as she sits there like a pretty Barbie doll (and Kristen Stewart isn't even much to look at here), then they both commit. And while you're watching it, it seems even less interesting than that. There is zero entertainment value unless you're a hopelessly horny female who humps her pillow with images of Edward in her head, or you're a hopelessly pathetic male who just wants to impress his girlfriend because he can relate to a 'emotional love story'. I can't comment on the former, but, seriously, I'm a guy who likes love stories and this is NOT a love story. It's a traditionalist middle school English essay with flat characters and no plot other than: put two horny kids together, but appeal to the 'dark' crowd by making it a vampire story . . . without even showing fangs.Other dishonorable mentions: 1) Twilight = Napoleon Dynamite - the humor + stupid subplots 2) The 'Restrain yourself, Edward, don't suck her blood!' scene brings unintentional cheese to a new level 3) The movie never ends; two hours seems like eternity (in hell) 4) Baseball doesn't make edge-of-your-seat action 5) There is no action 6) There are no real vampires unless you count pretty-boys 7) Stephanie Myers completely screws up the vampire myths I almost feel sorry for Catherine Hardwicke. She's an amazing director, and she singlehandedly turned this stupid crap-fest into a well-done movie on a technical level, and everything else was out of her hands. But who would honestly turn down the money this movie would bring in? I don't blame her, I blame Stephanie Myers.I also feel sorry for the countless people who watch this and think it's a quality love story, thus never being exposed to the true love stories out there. What is Twilight? A horny, unoriginal, childish fantasies put into a movie. That, like always, wins mass reader, and now viewer, acclaim. I just wish one day popular fiction wasn't a synonym for retard fiction.0/10",1,24,37,29 November 2008
The Mist," Classic horror, maybe. Cliché, definitely.
","Everything was great except the creatures. Why did Stephen King have to write about something as lame and unoriginal as bug-things? And why did all the main characters have to be so downright typical and boring? Why did they have to use a cut-off scene right when a direct shot would have been more effective in the 'mean spirited' ending? Why were the effects so sub-par? If those things were fixed, this would have been one amazing movie. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, considering I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. It's worth a watch, but don't expect to be amazed. It is not scary, it is not disturbing, and it's not anything to brag about.The single reason I even give this a 4 instead of 1 is because the morality (or questions about it) were pretty interesting, but nothing mind-blowing.This movie plays it safe. I guess the ending could be considered a break from the expected, but other than that, it's as typical and typical comes.",4,0,2,1 September 2008
I Am Legend," I remember a time when action movies had action.
","The top ten reasons this is the most unoriginal movie ever made: Cliché 1  'And now we spread light into the darkness!' Tee-hee-hee! I think it was Jesus who said that before Hollywood decided to make it as common and meaningless as 'Have a great day!'.Cliché 2  Monsters that try to look like zombies. And not cool zombiestry pathetic moaning retards that looked like they couldn't poop and turned green or something. Scary? If I was Will Smith, I would have hit them with a rock and ended the terrible movie right there.Cliché 3  An all-consuming virus that turns people into zombies! The melodrama makes me cringe with excitement! Oh wait . . . that was the first time I heard that plot line with (far superior) video games like Resident Evil and (far, far superior) movies like The Hills Have Eyes. Give it a rest, please.Cliché 4  The post-apocalyptic plot that isn't a plot at all. Or, most simply, the entire running time of the movie. My 2-year-old cousin has more imagination.Cliché 5  Not only are there zombies, but the zombies only come out in the dark! Wow! If I close my eyes and pretend that this hasn't been done 1000 times, I might find that kinda cool! Cliché 6  The main character sacrifices himself for the good of a woman and humanity . . .Cliché 7  . . . but like every other Hollywood hit that the critics love, he's too stupid for his own good. He had close to a minute (yes, I counted) to open up the shutter and escape the grenade, but he just stood there like a retarded teenager as it went off.Cliché 8  Boring opening, just like the cliché critics love. It took an hour and a half before anything action-like happened. Oh wait, there was no action. I'm thinking about myself peeing after it was overthat was more action-packed than the entire movie put together.Cliché 9  Flat characters who's names I couldn't even remember during the movie, much less after it was over.Cliché 10  This is my favorite. Can you guess it? Everything in this movie has been done in at least 3 other movies I can think of off the top of my head.People say Napoleon Dynamite didn't have a plot? Honestly, folks, this was more pointless than Napoleon even could have been. And at least he wasn't a sad cliché who was too stupid to open up a door and save his life.And I'm not even going to go into the boring pretentiousness of everything else this movie tried to be but wasn't. Let me put it this way: if you have enough attention span for this movie, I feel sorry for you.0/10.",1,4,5,1 September 2008
The Game," A ridicules, well-done thriller. Wait . . . what?
","The Game doesn't try to be anything except a standard, well-done thriller with an intelligent moral. In David Fincher's mind, that was all he was trying to accomplish. Did he do it? Well . . . I'm not sure I have a definitive opinion either way.On a technical level, The Game certainly succeeds. David Fincher knows how to use a camera, and I'm not sure anyone, including the most negative reviews of this film, could say otherwise. The Game creates a flawlessly dark atmosphereliterally, but not so much figuratively. Instead of jumping on the wagon and trashing the viewer over the head with horror clichés as similar movies do, The Game slowly builds up to its over-the-top moments in an attempt to immense the viewer in reality before going into the unbelievable. If this movie were in the hands of any other director but Fincher, it would have been the single biggest cliché-fest in cinematic history because it wouldn't practice any subtly whatsoever. For example, the clown in the opening of the movie was fully grounded in The Game, but in any other movie would have just looked like a cliché prop. This is a credit I do have to give Fincher . . .But it's also a credit I have to take back by the end of the movie. Simply put, I've seen a lot of unbelievable movies, and I usually vouch for them. 'Unbelievable movies are rarely as unbelievable as real life,' is something you'll always hear me say. Not so with The Game. At all. By the midway point, the level of ridicules things happening brought to me to the point of laughing. Though other reviews have taken the time to carefully label and point out every plot hole, there is one big one that few people are seeing. The people behind the game could not know every single move the main character would make to such a precise degree. Period. When you finally figure this out by the middle of the movie, the entire plot become worthless and very formulated.The other major problem I had with The Game is it's absolutely nothing new or original in the least. Thriller writers have used this exact plot so many times it's second nature to the hardcore thriller fan, such as myself.And when I say 'rehash' I mean it in every way I can. The Game is so slow-paced and tedious, not to mention repetitious, I could honestly see people shouting 'We get it, come on!' at the screen. Oh the irony: what is the point of a thriller if it isn't thrilling? Entertainment valuealongside originalityis almost a dead concept among modern directors, isn't it? They're so fixed on making sure their movies have some sort of cliché, pretentious social commentary they forget that watching a movie was once, dare I say it, a fun thing to do.Don't get me wrong. When I say movies lack entertainment value, that doesn't mean I'm not all for movies that scar the viewer and show them something meaningful, but The Game isn't that either. The big moral point at the end is just another cliché in the pit of clichés The Game already was. We got it back with A Christmas Carrol and It's a Wonderful Lifewhy did we sit through this tedious movie just to hear old news? Excuse the overused pun, but in every aspect The Game loses. It leaves the viewer feeling like they were just cheated in the same way the main character was, but not in the meaningful way. More in a 'I could have done the laundry in the time it took to watch that pointless movie!' kind of way.1/10",1,13,27,3 December 2008
Ghostbusters," It just didn't do it for me.
","As a comedy, it wasn't funny. As a mild horror movie, it wasn't thrilling.It was so boring I felt like shooting myself. The ending was nice and Mr. Puff was nifty, but couldn't they have made it less freaking boring? It reminded me of watching someone play a video game, but scripted. There wasn't nearly enough action to keep me interested. The cliché sub-plots used in pretty much every comedy ever made just got really annoying.I guess I can say it was an original idea for the time it came out, and that it is worth watching just to know the thousands of references, but I can't say it was much fun at all. Maybe you just had to have grown up with this movie to love it, because I certainly didn't.5/10",5,14,31,9 September 2008
Gran Torino," Old men are a little cooler than middle-aged men, but that still isn't saying much.
","I should have gone with my gut instinct and used the 2 hours and 57 minutes and the $10 that I used on this film to go to the bowling alley and stare awkwardly at senior citizens. I would have gotten infinitely more from that experience than I got from Gran Torino.Exactly as to be expected with these types of 'fine cinema' films, Gran Torino uses up the majority of its runtime watching an old man walk around and talk. It uses a very littlehonestly, next-to-noneof its runtime actually telling a STORY. (I put that in all caps because it's something I'll reference again in this review.) To give Gran Torino a little bit of credit, I these boring talking scenes aren't nearly as boring as I expected. While most modern so-called 'action' movies focus on nothing but watching middle-aged men talk about a 1-dementional plot that the average person could come up with in a coma, Gran Torino does the exact same thing, but with an older man, who is a little more interesting than the norm. I give the movie that. And that's all I give it. For the typical drama that it was, it had a couple cute lines of dialogue. I'm not going to rave about Clint Eastwood's acting, because, honestly, I didn't see anything special about it. There's nothing impressive about an old man playing and old man. You might as well have asked Clint Eastwood to play Clint Eastwood, and people would literally bathe him in Oscars and perfect-score reviews for it. So, in other words, what I'm trying to say is this. Gran Torino isn't the worst movie I've seen by a long shot. An old man giving out cliché speeches is cooler than a middle-aged man complaining about his wife, but that doesn't mean it's good.In fact, Gran Torino really isn't really good at all. People will only see it as good because it's watchable, and most people can't even remember the last movie they saw that didn't bore them to utter tears. The entertainment industry as a whole has sunk so low that movies like this stand out as something that passes time. If a movie can pass time without putting you to sleep, then, by God, it's good. No, it's great. No, it's one of the best movies you've ever seen in your life! Forgive me, but I'm not quite that easily influenced. Just because Gran Torino passed time without boring me too much, I'm not going to give it a good review. Why? Because at heart, it's just another cliché, pansy excuse at a heartfelt life-changing movie, and I'm sick of the same godforsaken story every time I walk into my godforsaken movie theater. (Replace 'godforsaken' with your preferred choice of harsh language that this site censors.) If I sound angry, it's because I am. I read somewhere that a lady threw up due to the heavy use of racial slurs in this film. That didn't bother me. What bothered me is that I'm sick of movies like this getting produced, and I'm even sicker of them getting good scores.What am I talking about? I'm talking about STORY. Does anyone reading this even know that that ancient term means? There was once a time when movies actually had a STORY to tell, not just some average acting praised up to the point absurdity. STORY is the sole thing that Gran Torino doesn't have, and it makes it soulless. It makes it forgettable. If there is any 'deep morality' is Gran Torino, it's not the cliché sayings about life/death that Eastwood wanted us to talk away from it. No, it's the satire in us sitting and watching people talk for 2 hours and 57 minutes without a single plot point until the last half hour. Then, even when there is a plot, it's a pathetic cliché. It's almost humorous to me. Mid-way through the movie I got a phone call on my cell from a friend. What that call made me realize is that I have a life with people more interesting to talk to than Gran Torino even knew how to present. Instead of living my life, I was sitting there watching clichés live theirs on a screen. Do I sound like a rambling old man? Maybe. But, whippersnapper, I have a point: What is the point of watching a movie if it doesn't show us something we can't see/hear walking down the street? That's the killing blow in Gran Torino. It has no story. It has nothing to say we can't hear in the car driving home. Is it completely devoid of all entertainment value? No. In the end, is it pointless? Absolutely.When the 1-demntional plot eventually happens, it's completely throw-away. Without spoiling the predictable ending, Gran Torino is one of the many modern films that builds racial tension to the breaking point, then spews out clichés at the climax. If the climax had ended on a more original note, it would have not only gotten a higher score for me, but it would have been much more thought-provoking. Also, on a much less stern note, the racial jokes really stopped being funny after the third time Clint repeated each of them. By the 15th time he repeated each of them, they became just downright immature and lacked any creativity at all.I'll conclude with one of the 'deep morals' Gran Torino teaches. Ironically, instead of having its self-proclaimed balls, it plays into every safe, unoriginal idea that every movie just like it uses. As much as Clint's character (and movie) spouts off about not being a pansy, Gran Torino within itself is nothing but a '25-year-old virgin that gets confessions by holding the hands of old ladies.' Instead of having the balls to be different, Gran Torino is just another face in the unoriginal crowd. Oh, the irony. Or more accurately: Oh, the hypocrisy.2/10",1,7,19,30 January 2009
Children of Men," This movie is for you if you like watching people sit around for 2 hours.
","Tell me if you've seen this scenario before: a movie that claims to be anti-Hollywood, and supposedly has a 'deep moral and social commentary' that the critics love, only the movie turns out to be pretentious and one of the most pathetic movies ever made. That's about all there is to say about Children of Menit claimed to come and deliver all of us thriller fans to the promise land, but in reality it was even more pathetic than the multimillion making blockbuster.First, there is NOTHING intellectual or deep as promised. I can hear the director/writer now: 'I want to make another tired end-of-the-world movie, just like the ones I grew up watching on Saturday morning cartoons and then saw done in live-action more so many times it almost seemed cliché . . . but, umm, I can be original. Hey! Instead of a virus wiping out humanity, let's make women unfertile, but Everything else will be just like every other end-of-the-world movie ever made.' Sadly, I guess people didn't pay attention in junior high English classes: by taking the most unoriginal story ever toldthe end of the worldand then changing one factor does not make it original. It's the same as replacing humans in the end of the world with animals and calling it original. Even then, infertility isn't an untouched subject by any means.<ul><li>Original? Thought provoking? Neither.</li></ul>Second, nothing happens in this movie. From opening to close, you see the same thing over and over again. They go from one angry mob to another angry mob; from one house to another house. Even then, the pacing is so ridiculously slow I was ready to fast forward because all that was happening was Napoleon Dynamite-like staring. Or pointless conversations. Or just downright NOTHING, where the camera will literally sit and stare at a wall. Children of Men took boredom to a whole new level I didn't even know existed.<ul><li>Thrilling? If shots of the wall and lame conversations thrill you, you'll have gone in your pants 15 minutes in.</li></ul>As far as technical details go: there was not even half of enough violence to earn this movie an R-rating. The cinematography is hand-held and it adds a layer of realism. This realism, however, just makes the movie even more dull and boring because it's exactly like what you could walk outside your house and see. It gives you even less of an excuse to pay attention. What Hollywood and indie filmmakers both don't understand is that what America wants isn't just another so-real-it's-scary thriller, we want something we can't walk outside our own houses and see. A mature fantasy, if you will. Why do you think 300 did so well, while this movie failed? Because 300 was a mature fantasy, while this is just another tired 'thriller' that doesn't even have enough wind to thrill or enough intelligence to be original.I just can't get over the fact that nothing happened in the entire runtime of this movie. That's why I gave it such a low score. The screenplay couldn't have been longer than 20 pages, because the scenes were long but there was nothing happening in them. Sure, it had a cute and different way to end humanity, but the story is so thin the average person could have thought of every detail of this movie in a coma.I think it's movies like this that make me think originality is dead, not your big-name blockbusters. Blockbusters have expectations they have to match, but it's a sad day when indie films like this can't even think of something more original than this. What's even sadder is people like you try to build it up as intellectual and amazing instead of lowering your standards so something truly original and mind-blowing can have a chance to be released. The public opinion sells, and I guess this is what everyone wants: a hideously unoriginal film that claims to be intellectual but in reality is nothing more than a paper-thin plot with paper-thin characters and less thrills than a stroll down your street.It's your call.0/10",1,6,14,19 September 2008
Event Horizon," Am I really the only person who thought this was the cheesiest movie of all time?
","I have a handful of friends who refuse to watch horror movies because they think they're all pure cheese. Event Horizon is definitely gives their argument some backbone. Here is one of the most acclaimed and said to be the scariest movies among horror fans, but when I watched it all I could do is chuckle. Event Horizon is cheese horror, and here is why: - The casting is horrible. The characters are not only all clichés, but they're clichés who can't act. They say some of the stupidest lines in the history of cinemalike, 'Look, a corpse-sickle!'and then act as if they've said the most intelligent thing ever. It's ridicules.<ul><li>The entire movie is filled with melodramatic scenes. Something bad will happen, then it's accompanied by a laughing man imitating Dr. Eviland everyone still takes him seriously. One of the absolute cheesiest lines is, 'Once you're evil, you don't need eyes . . .' as Dr. Evil-wannabe cackles in his chair. Sorry, I didn't know I was watching a comedy.</li></ul><ul><li>There is no atmosphere, tension, suspense, or terror. The movie jumps strait from the opening to the scenes that are supposed to be scary, but never gives you any suspense or atmosphere. The ship is so abstract it looks like one of those play places at McDonalds or something, not a bearer of doom that the movie expects you to think of it as.</li></ul><ul><li>Why does EVERY sci-fi movie have to rip-off Medline L'Engle's book A Wrinkle In Time, then think it's the first movie to come up with the idea? I could list at least 10 movies that have done that, and this makes number 11. Great, we get it: if you fold space you can go from one place to the other faster. We get it already. Think of something new, please. We understood it in the 60's, we understand it now. What I don't understand is why EVERY sci-fi movie can't think of something even slightly new instead of using the same old tired cliché and acting as if it's the first time we ever heard it.</li></ul><ul><li>There were at least 5 wake-up-and-it's-just-a-dream sequences in this movie, and every time they just get cheesier and cheesier.</li></ul>I'm not even sure there is more for me to complain about because all that is fresh in my mind is how cheesy Event Horizon was. I cannot remember a single minute of the runtime that I actually found something serious or scary. Sure, I can understand why some people would find this movie scary, because as Stephen King proved hundreds of times, cheese scares people. But for someone like me who is spoiled by truly good sci-fi/horror movies, like Alien, I simply can't take this seriously. The premise is great, but that's all I can give it. I think this movie proves that everything Paul W.S. Anderson turns to cheese. If he directed it, even if it's somehow acclaimed, don't see it.1/10",1,31,66,21 September 2008
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A review written for anyone who didn't grow up with this movie.
","I'll just put it this way: I didn't grow up on The Nightmare Before Christmas and, honestly, viewing it now, I don't get why it's so hyped up. I can understand how someone who saw it in their childhood, or even someone who saw it when it first came out, would consider it classic, but for someone who didn't, it just seems forgettable. I saw The Corpse Bride before seeing this, and I thought it was better in every way imaginable.I'm not going to smash childhood memories and trash the film, because, really, there is nothing wrong with it. It's imaginative and fun, with a great plot and interesting characters. Unlike Tim Burton's live-action movies, there is very few clichÃ©s. The fantasy word he creates is rich, vivid, and unlike any other.Now why I didn't like it: <ul><li>For 1993, the animation was top notch. For 2008, anyone first coming into this movie is going to think it looks pathetic, which I did. It just takes you away from the overall experience. On an animation scale, comparing this to Wall-E is like comparing The Blob to Transformers. It's such a huge gap, it's almost impossible to ignore.</li></ul><ul><li>It lacks a high entertainment value. Why? I don't really know, but I have read other reviews that agree with me. Maybe it would have been better if it wasn't a musical.</li></ul><ul><li>Except for a few songs, a lot of the songs just aren't . . . good. Some of them even felt gimmicky and there to characterize (such as Oogie Boogie's song). The majority of the songs are just unnecessary and don't drive the plot or characterization whatsoever.</li></ul>Overall, being someone who literally just saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, I was let down. I can understand why people who grew up with it would love it, but those people also need to understand why people who didn't may not enjoy it as much. I personally prefer animated children's horror such as Monster House over this because it has higher entertainment value.6/10",6,1,5,30 October 2008
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Dr.: The Tale of the Blurry Dildo
","Here is the only point I want to get across in this entire review: Watching Mulholland Dr. made me feel like an adult forced to see a children's film.For every 1 parent that takes their toddler to see an adult (aka, violent or sexual) film, there are 10 parents that silently that scream foul. Perhaps, in the social safety of their own home, on their computer, they'll type up a bitter 'Middle-Age Angst Comment' on their message board of choice. Perhaps, if they're pseudo-intellectual, they'll type of a cute little review of the film and self-publish it on all the websites like the one I'm using right now. Either way, their predictable message is always the same: 'Movies ruin kids' innocence! (Even if I saw A Clockwork Orange when I was 3, and it didn't affect me one bit, they will HURT your children!)' I'm not here to debate this (unintentionally hilarious) group of parents, but, rather, I want to use their argument to help illustrate my point about Mulholland Dr.Mulholland Dr. made me feel like an adult forced to see a children's film. Instead of destroying my innocence and adding complexity to my thinking (as the loss of innocence always does), I feel like it made me just a little bit dumber.First of all, do not assume I'm one of the thousands of people who didn't understand this film. I got it. I understood it. Before attempting to write this review, I even read official sites and threads dedicated to understanding it, just to make sure I wasn't missing any of the 'brilliance'. I didn't.Like all surrealist films, Mulholland Dr. is childish in concept. At root value, it uses the exact same plot as The Wizard of Oz, but adds some sex to make it seem more 'mature'. The only thing that makes the film hard to understand is the stupid scenes where David Lynch uses cheap camera/storytelling tricks to force confusion. Or, to force weirdness, if you prefer that word.Think of the entire film way. Someone tells you that they hid a dildo in a box, somewhere in the United States. Then they tell you to find it. They give you a couple vague clues hidden in a film, and you're off.Two problems: (1) Why should you even care? It's a dildo. That's exactly how I felt about this film. Why should I even care about these characters? They're just flat characters presented in a way that will eventually shock the viewer with David Lynch's oh-so-horrifying portrayal of a sexual topic that is about as common and accepted in the real word as 'Racism is BAD!' There's nothing to care about here. It's sex. How many times have I seen cliché sex scenes in a movie? Thousands, millions. I just don't care. (2) This method of mystery is childish. In Mulholland Dr., Lynch does not create a complex story whatsoever; he just creates a story that is visually hard to follow. If you showed me a picture of a walrus zoomed up close, I wouldn't know what it was. If you create a typical Wizard of Oz rip-off, place the camera just off-center, obscuring the important bits, I don't know what it is. That doesn't mean it's complex. It means it's childish. It's just a child that steals another child's lunch money and plays Keep Away with it.This is why Mulholland Dr. offers absolutely nothing original. It's a story that has been done before; it is just filmed a little out of focus. This kind of pseudo-originality is even less complex than Tarantino, who is a director who I only bring up because he seems to be hated a lot by Lynch fans, for whatever reason. Tarantino takes unoriginal concepts and pumps them up with original scenes and ideas and stories. Lynch just takes unoriginal stories and makes them a little blurry.Regardless of the predicable story, the film is pathetic, even on a visual level. The acting is hokey, which is something that I think Lynch intends, but it only adds to the children's film concept. Hokey doesn't equal weird; it just equals: 'Dude, seriously, when are you going to grow up . . . ?' Also, it's boring as hell. I can be patient if the story is original, but when you know everything that is going to happen, and have seen every scene before, I just don't care. Because of this, Mulholland Dr. was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Not to mention that Lynch takes his blessed time by having characters stare at each other stupidly, like they're auditioning for a bad parody of Napoleon Dynamite.In conclusion, let me say this: I can't tell the difference between directors anymore. I watch audio commentaries every time they're available on a DVD, whether I liked the movie or not. There may be a few exceptions, but 99% of directors say the same things. They look the same. They wear the same glasses. They have the same ideas on what is good. They all appear to have an understanding of what is 'cliché', but there is always a plethora of clichés in their films. They all have the nonconformist attitude, but they all make the same unoriginal movies.David Lynch is supposedly one of the most brilliant and weird directors in history. Maybe the popular opinion backs up that statement. Maybe the critics back up that opinion. But, really, folks, David Lynch is just a face in the crowd of surrealist directors. With Mulholland Dr., he adds absolutely nothing new to the table. Because of his popularity, all he does is sit a little higher at the table than the no-name directors that did what he did, long before he did, much better than he did.2/10",2,4,12,10 September 2009
The Evil Dead," Boyish childhood fantasy violence.
","Let me be blunt: I ignored this movie with my life for years because I assumed it was just another cheesy zombie movie that would amount to nothing more than yet another night of boredom that I'd end up falling asleep to. I LOVE zombie video games, but I have never once seen a zombie movie that could fulfill that awesomeness and utter zombie carnage that games like Dead Rising and Resident Evil did. Until I saw The Evil Dead, I assumed it was simply impossible to put that much awesomeness that zombie games have on film. Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead both bored me, were pathetic, and couldn't come close to filling that hole that zombie games put in my heart. So, why would I want to watch something like The Evil Dead? I only watched it because one of my favorite critics, Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation, suggested it. To my shock, The Evil Dead is the first and only zombie movie I have ever enjoyed. Ever.Unlike boring George A. Romero films The amount of punk carnage was not toned down, much like the games I love. The characters actually have some personality and had something to say other than: 'Oh, God, zombies!' over and over again. They didn't bother to ask what is going on, giving them a sense of self-aware realism. This movie was also purely for ENTERTAINMENT. Let me repeat myself: ENTERTAINMENT. Do half the directors/writers out there even know what that world means? There was no brainless social commentary we've heard since we were old enough to pee on our own, as seems to be included in every movie ever made by law or something. I think that is why I like Sam Raimbi so much, because he clearly states that his movies are for ENTERTAINMENT (I'm going to put that in all caps from now on in hopes some random director who stumbles on this will remember what it means) and not for retarded critical acclaim or some pointless social commentary.As for the violence, for an 80's movie, it was freaking childishly amazing! This is the kind of stuff I'd dream about as a little boy. Some of the gore effects were hard to look at because they were insanely outdated, but they were few and far between. At times, they even added to the cheese atmosphere. This is just as violent as modern horror movies like 30 Days of Night and The Hills Have Eyes remake, if you can look past the armature blood effects. (I'm mainly referring to the lack of decent blood on the severed limbs/heads.) Also, the cheesy disturbing factor added to it. But unlike modern horror movieslike Mirrorsthere was no cheap cliché scares. The clichés that were there this movie created, which I can ignore. The idea of being raped by trees was pretty original and laughably disturbing, in a good way, as well. Also, the idea of zombies that . . . umm, shape-shiftedis that what they did?was both original and just awesome. I'm not even sure I'd call them zombies as much as vampire-evil-doll-clown-zombie-demon . . . things.Overall, this gave me a new hope that zombie movies could be truly amazing and gory. This really is THE best zombie movie EVER. Why? Because it remembers ENTERTAINMENT.What more can I say?5/10",7,0,6,31 August 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," If only Napoleon Dynamite had gore and crude sexual content . . .
","That would be this movie. Kill Bill is far from perfect, but it is perfect for people like me, to an extent. The quirky action sequences, the primary colors, the so-simple-it's-genius script . . . it's unlike any live-action movie ever made. Period. But don't expect a gorefestevery trick in the book is used to make sure there isn't much blood on screen at one time. The black-and-white sequences literally turning the blood into water are the biggest example. I wasn't impressed with the gore, but I was impressed with the style.This is easily one of the best followers of the punk over-the-top style. If I said any more than that, it would ruin the movie for you.",9,0,1,21 September 2008
Saw II," A continuation of perfection.
","Someone apparently didn't tell the men and women behind the Saw franchise that thrillers had to be about terrorists, boobs, and have a clichéd social commentary that we've heard since we were 3-years-old. That's why the Saw franchise is easily the only truly original movies being released todaythey break every genre rule you think you know.Saw II takes the same formula from the original Saw and spins it, making it bigger and gorier. It allows you a much deeper look into the mind of Jigsaw, and further shows that Jigsaw himself defies any and every cliché you thought a villain must abide by. What makes him so complex is that he isn't a villain at all; in reality, he's the only good guy in the entire franchise.Also, Saw II proves thrillers can be thrilling. I simply cannot remember a thriller that actually had something going on from beginning to end, without a single dead spot in the entire movie, but that is exactly what Saw II is. There are no pointless conversation scenes that plague every thriller/action movie because the director thinks he's so original, when in reality the audience understood the movie from the first trailer. Saw II gives the audience creditthank God someone, anyone, understands how to tell a truly adrenaline-pumping story.Gore-wise, the movie excels. In an era when Hollywood has turned to generic, family-friendly gore, it's insanely refreshing to see a series that actually makes gore disturbing again. People often compare the Saw franchise to Hostel as far as gore, and all I can say is this: Saw blows Hostel out of the water here. Hostel uses cut-off camera scenes, where NONE of the gore is on screen, and all the gore is generic and boring. The Saw series, specifically Saw II, does not cut the camera away for ANYTHING. Everything is on-screen, and everything is disturbing and cringe-worthy. Saw II is easily the most brutal of the Saw series.None of the five plot twists in the end of Saw II match the single plot twist in the end of the original Saw, but there is the thing: the movie has five plot twists! It takes a lot of thought just to inject a single sub-par twist into a movie without making it seem gimmicky, but Saw II does five of them with perfection. Once again, how can a movie get better than this? Like I said when I wrote my review for Saw and Saw III, how can a movie get more perfect? The action never stops or even slows, and the plot puts most every movie of our generation to shame. Saw II makes every other thriller I have ever seen, including Hostel and it's sequel, look just downright cute.10/10",10,1,2,21 September 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," Fun . . . is there more to say?
","Quentin Tarantino is a genius, and I'm not even sure I know why he is a genius. The opening to this movie rivals Pulp Fiction as some of the coolest work the man has done. Yes, Rodriguez directed, but Tarantino wrote and acted, and I consider this to fully be his movie. Every Rodriguez film where Tarantino had no major influence has totally sucked and been a bore-fest.The first half is awesome Pulp Fiction-ish stuff, but once they get to the Titty Twister it turns to awesome 30 Days of Night-ish stuff. The only problem I could find with either half was the creature effects were pretty outdated and really took away from the feel.With that said, the characters are completely believable and freaking fun. The plot is pure genius. I didn't even have to check the time for how long it had left even once, which is pretty much something I do with every movie. I wasn't bored for a second, and I get bored insanely easily.It's even better if you have no idea what is going to happen, and I highly suggest you watch it like that or have a friend watch it like that. This movie is one that really relies on surprise to fully love.This movie is one that understands entertainment, not just a petty cliché moral. How much better can a movie get?5/10",5,0,1,2 September 2008
The Dark Knight," Yes it's overrated, but it's better than a lot of crap out there.
","Sorry to whoever thinks this movie is the best movie of all time, but I found a lot of it to be dull. The first hour and a half were so boring I was ready to walk out. Batman himself was literally like nothing but a black piece of cardboard that walks around and says 'Stop bad person!' every time a crime happens. The Dark Knight proves that Batman really is the crown jewel of flat, cliché characters devoid of any personality whatsoever. Add the hour of boring, pointless conversations that is all that makes up the first hour, and The Dark Knight seems just like every other lame action movie. Maybe in the end it really is nothing but a lame action movie, but one factor kills that and raises my score from a 'Meh, whatever . . .' to a 'That was pretty nifty!': Heath Ledger as Joker.I've seen a lot of action and horror movies in my life, and I can guarantee I've seen just about every villain who was worth watching. On one website I was on, people were even debating if Hannibal Lector was better than Joker, to which all I can say is: Hannibal is an emo pretty boy who would have turned out fine if he got more attention from his mother, but Joker is the real deal. Joker doesn't have any cliché motives, he's a complete nihilist, and Heath Ledger plays him to such an amazing degree it's scary. If this movie had have been allowed an R-rating, and Joker's carnage could have been fully shown on screen with blood, he would have almost too godly for my mind to process. Joker is flawless, and puts every single villain I have ever seen to shame.Sadly, as I said in my first paragraph, the rest of the movie doesn't follow that example of perfection. Every other character was dull and uninspired, and used for no other reason to fill the screen with an hour and a half of pointless talking scenes about the plot that we've known since the first trailer. I've said it before and I'll say it again: ACTION movies do not need CONVERSATION about what is going on. The audience knows what is going ongive us at least that much credit. Conversation BORES us, and if directors don't stop using it so copiously, we'll stop giving them our MONEY. That's why The Dark Knight was so dull: conversation between boring characters that amounts to nothing. If they had taken that out, I would have given this a perfect 10 and seen the movie five times just to support a director who understands his audience.The good. The plotting was great, Joker was godly, a lot of the decisions the characters made flew in the face of the obvious clichés, there was a lot of diversity in scenery, the action was godly, and the morality wasn't cliché and actually had a decent point that could be applied to everyday life. This is something that has always annoyed me about movies with social commentaries/morals: they're never something you can apply to your life. Either their something cliché like No Country for Old Men's pathetic, 'We all die!' or just impractical like Sweeny Todd's, 'Don't kill people or you'll end up dead!' The Dark Knight is more intelligent that than, and uses its morality in a way that is left up the viewer to decide/think through. Directors/writers, please take note.Overall, some of the action scenes were some of the best I've ever seen in my life. The main problem with The Dark Knight, however, is how dull it is at times. When you try to take something childish and make it dark and mature, it almost will always end up dull, and it's sad that the director/writer didn't notice this.But everything bad I said just pales when I think of how cool Joker was, or how amazing some of the action scenes were. I can forget I just sat through a boring hour of talking. I can forget Batman is a cliché, pointless character. If I were to focus on those things I'd be looking at the movie the wrong way. This is Joker's movie. And, dear God, he puts on a good show.7/10",8,4,9,19 September 2008
Saw," The best thriller ever made.
","I'm a huge fan of the horror and action genres, and I've seen most all of what both have to offer. Though sometimes I'd find a movie that was great, I've never once seen anything like Saw. It created its own sub-genre and it turned every cliché I've ever known on its end. Saw is one of the only perfect movies I've ever seen.The reason Saw is original is because it takes everything you've known about standard storytelling rules and completely ignores every one. The villain is the only 'good guy' you're going to see and the 'good guys' are the only 'bad guys' you're going to see. From that basic stance alone, I cannot name another movie like Saw. I know works of literature like A Clockwork Orange try to make bad seem good, but it's done is such a traditional way it is ridiculously predictable and nothing really that hasn't been done before. But Saw is so simple in how it twists the rules of storytelling that it is blatantly obvious and punk. The literary geeks hate this movie because it does something they said could never be done: it breaks the rules they said every story had to abide by. The critics hate this movie because it isn't a safe cliché that they have known all their lives like No Country for Old Men. The standard horror enthusiast hates this movie because it breaks every rule of a traditional horror plot ever conceived. And unlike the supposed 'deep moral' movies like Battle Royale, Saw actually has moral point that you can use and a moral that isn't a redundant cliché.As far as gore goes, it's enough to hold me over but isn't really excessive or as insane as the other movie in the series. But I think what make this an effective movie is there is no cheese like in the old slashers. This is something that could happen, and it's portrayed that way. Also, unlike every other movie like it, Saw is not only twisted but gory as well. It's almost an unspoken rule in cinema that if your movie is twisted/disturbing then you cannot show gore. I'm referring to movies like Sev7n and The Silence of the Lambstwisted, but no gore on screen. Once again, Saw breaks another rule.But what really sells Saw is the stylish punk style. With the flash-cuts, the lighting-paced editing, the blood on screen at almost all points in the moviethis was made for the ADD generation. I'll never understand why traditionalistseven those who don't want to admit they're traditionaliststhink there has to be at least 20 minutes of pure boredom every other scene for a movie to be good. Saw is a true thrillerit doesn't give you a second to sit there and be bored into a comfort zone.The ending plot twist is the single best plot twist of all time. I've seen a lot of plot twists, and while most of them go down the bland physiological path, or the cliché you-thought-I-was-a-good-guy-but-I'm-the-killer! stance, Saw once again uses its own plot to do a plot twist like none I've ever seen. The entire movie is deceptive, and you literally know nothing until the last 5 minutes.I simply cannot think of a single thing wrong with Saw. I tried, but I can't. It's the most perfect thriller ever made, and one of the most original movies of the modern generation.10/10",10,1,3,9 September 2008
A Clockwork Orange," I can't decide if it was written by a horny 12-year-old boy or a brilliant storyteller.
","People always say it's impossible not to have an overt opinion on this film100% negative or 100% positivedue to the supposed graphic content. I'm sorry to break the norm, but I really fail to see it as horrid, disgusting cinema, and I also fail to see it as a brilliant masterpiece. In some ways, I just find A Clockwork Orange an average movie that was very well directed.The first hour or so seems to have been written by a teenage boy just starting to go through puberty. I fail to see anything mature whatsoever in parading infinite numbers of topless women across screen. It just seems a whole lot like a middle-aged manKubrick and/or Burgessfantasizing about all the sex he wished he could have. The prevalent penis imagery is borderline self-parody. It's something you see in American Pie and laugh at, not something you watch in 'fine cinema' and give deep thought to. The entire first hour of A Clockwork Orange honestly had me laughing out loud because I can't understand how this could be taken as mature whatsoever.This is why I failed to find anything about A Clockwork Orange even mildly perverse or upsetting. The rape scenes are all generic rape scenes that seem to happen in EVERY last 70s movie, and not one of them went into graphic detail. A Clockwork Orange didn't do anything 'perverse' that hundreds of other movies hadn't done before it. If anything, I found the supposed sexual perversity to be very mild, even for its time. As I said, parading nude women around and having a prevalent penis aesthetic is just downright humorous when you think about it, not gruesome. It doesn't rub your face in the dirt of humanity, it's worthy of a grin.The violent content is even less perverse. I don't even remember any of the hyped-up violent content whatsoever. A few old men get hit with a clubthat's literally it. There is no more blood than Star Wars (rated PG), and when there is blood it looks so unrealistic it was laughable, not disturbing. There is NOTHING even mildly violent in A Clockwork Orange at all. How did this get falsely labeled as one of the most violent films of all time? Honestly, how? If it had been made today, it would easily get a PG or PG-13 without any protest. Compared to any and every R-rated movie I've seen this year, A Clockwork Orange looks downright family friendly. If you have not seen A Clockwork Orange, take my word: this is not even a mildly violent film. At all.The directing is godlike. I see no need to elaborate further, because people have done so in every single review on here. I will say, however, that, as well-done as the surrealist imagery is, it sometimes gets silly quick. More than once during the film I felt like I was watching Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory gone terribly wrong, and with less creativity. While it's fun to look at, there is nothing original about the imagery by any means. I found a lot of it bland and predictable.But despite all that, the one major flaw I have with A Clockwork Orange is the pathetic liner storyline. A Clockwork Orange only gets boring a few times because Kubrick's directing and use of music is so great, but that can't make up for the hollow story. Alex himself is basically a one-dimensional idea that gets thrown around into a predicable formula according to the idealistic plot. I'm not saying I disagree with Burgess's ideology in any wayI don'tbut that doesn't make the story any less hollow and unimaginative. It always annoys me like none other when an author can think of some of the most original details for a story (like the milk bar and the slang), but the story itself is painfully unoriginal. It's the same problem most surrealist fiction suffers from, and it's still a problem here.So, do I have anything positive to say whatsoever? Not really, except that A Clockwork Orange is still enjoyable purely at the entertainment level. Though I just trashed most every aspect of it, I did have a lot of fun. It's certainly nothing special, but it's not bad either. If you don't take it as a ultra-serious, die-hard-classic, then you may have as much fun watching it as you had watching your favorite Disney movie as a kid. Sweet nostalgia.4/10",10,7,14,21 January 2009
The Descent," I miss why this is so amazing.
","I heard it was 'the best thriller since Aliens' from more than one person, and that gave me high hopes. What I got was a mix between something almost Saw-like, Alien-like, and something I have never seen before.The best parts of the movie had nothing do with the creatures. The revenge killing, the literal pool of blood, the accidental killings, the claustrophobiaall that was done perfectly. I just thought the cave dwellers held it all back due to their cliché and predictable nature. How many movies have you seen with monsters that only live to kill? Hundreds. Monsters in a horror movie are as predictable as Big Bird in an episode of Sesame Street. Without the monsters, the movie would have been less predictable. Anyway, the cave dwellers were nothing more than a dumber version of Orcs mixed with your standard jump-out-generic-monster.The cinematography was great, but it didn't impress me. The plot-twist in the very end (of the Unrated Edition) is, sadly, just another cliché used in almost every movie anymore.It was a fun movie. The upside-down killing is one of the coolest killings I have ever seen in a movie. I can't deny that this movie had its moments. But a few less clichés would have made this so much more fulfilling.4/10",4,4,6,1 September 2008
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Pointless.
","What was the point of that? I'm going to go do my laundry.End of review. 0/10.Okay, I really wish I could end there, because that's all the credit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves. It's one of the few movies I've even seen that is so bad it's actually below me to sit here and write a negative review. I've watched a lot of overrated films, but I've never once gone as far as to call a single movie 'The Most Overrated Film of All Time', simply because there are a lot of movies that could be called that. Naming one single movie 'The Most Overrated Film of All Time' is just ludicrous. But I am seriously reconsidering my own line of logic right now and giving this film that title. That is how much I simply cannot understand the hype and mass love for this film. At all. It's like a movie that should be on the bottom 100 movies of all time, but then somehow, some way, it gets loved by the public. I simply can't comprehend it.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a generic film noir piece set in a generic film noir world with generic film noir 'quirky' characters and a generic film noir plot. Everything, every last thing, is copy/pasted from otherbettermovies. Critics trash movies all the time for even minor unoriginality, yet this has to be one of the most unoriginal movies of all time and it's critically acclaimed? It's impossible not to see the unabashed rip-off scenes from Pulp Fiction, most notably. Not to mention the Reservoir Dogs inspired scenes. By the middle of the movie I literally forgot which wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie I was watching, because I've seen so many of them they all just blur together because they're all basically the same movie. They all repeat the same variations of Pulp Fiction quotes. They all have the same basic drug-kill-money plot. They all think they're so genius because they have one sub-par plot twist that isn't even a plot twist because we expect it in movies like this.Look, I like film noir, too, but I don't love everything just because it's a stylish crime movie. It has to be different. Film noir started back in the 40s, and I think it says something when the only few films in the genre that become anything more than a small cult success are the ones that are truly genre-defining and added much-needed originality to the genre, not the ones that just tag around the bandwagon. In other words, I can see some people possibly finding Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels entertaining if you're a genre fan. But overrating it to the point that its at is simply stupid. It's generic. It's exactly like everything you've seen before. It's just a frozen McDonald's hamburger in the generic fast food storehouse. Get over it.If you're not a film noir fan, don't bother watching it at all. You'll fall asleep. If you are, and you're in a good mood, I suggest you try it. If the first five minutes bore you as much as they did me, just know that the rest of the movie doesn't get any better. The jokes are the same jokes you've heard in all the other genre pieces. There is nothing good that can be said about the acting. Some of it is borderline terrible. It isn't cool. The pansy camera cutting away from every single act violenceeven as tame a punch in the mouth!gets so annoying I wished more than once I could turn it off. It isn't cool.There isn't a single thing about this movie that is likable or entertaining unless you get it up by watching generic middle-aged men trying to be cool.I'm done.This film noir fan has officially given up on the entire genre. I'm done. Instead of ripping-off Pulp Fiction a hundred more times, why don't directors actually do what Pulp Fiction did? Bring originality to the tired genre.0/10",1,14,31,19 December 2008
The Happening," M. Night, stay with PG-13 movies.
","I decently liked M. Night in the past, but I'm far from a fan-boy, so no matter what he did I can't be too disappointed with it because of hype or respect I have for the man himself. The reason so many reviews are so bad is because the viewer either hates or loves M. Night and they're opinions of him take or add to their opinion of the movie.For what it was, I disagree with people who say that it needed a killer or suspense or whatever. The story itself held up just fine, and only bordered on silly slightly (though I could see how some would think it's ludicrous). Also, all the fan-boys who claim the movie was 'original' and 'deep' are insane. The basic ideamass suicide with unknown causehas been done in countless Stephen King novels: The Stand and Cell are the two on the top of my head. *Spoilers* The idea of trees causing this has been done in countless old sci-fi movies like The Forbidden Planet and such. Even the maniac old in the end reminded me of a dumbed-down version of Hoit in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. *End spoilers* I can't name an original idea in the entire plot. As for people who defend Night by saying: 'People hate this movie because it is too deep, and they want more popcorn-flick thrillers!' are, once again, very wrong. The Happening takes on the same old global warming banter you've heard for years. Deep? Hardly. Even the whole 'faith vs. fear' meaning Night implies in his interviews has been done so many times it's almost a clichénot that the movie showed that meaning very strongly in the first place, if at all.It is also falsely advertised as being a violent/gory film. The head shot suicides are cut-off scenes, and any more unpractical suicide scenes are not shown. The most graphic scene shows a severed arm, but it is only on screen for a second. How it earned an R-rating I'll never understand, especially when Cloverfield showed just about as much blood and got a PG-13 rating. Also, any hope of being disturbed by the images, even though they're relatively gore-less, is minimal. There was a ditzy 12-year-old girl sitting next to me and she was laughing as some of the 'disturbing' scenes took place.I'm not sure if the acting was terrible as much as the characters just looked and acted stupid. You can defend that by saying it was how they were meant to be, but it simply was not pleasant to watch people being so silly in a movie that isn't meant to be black comedy.But in the end I think that's how it's taken. Black comedy. The opening 20 minutes had me and the younger (and more desensitized) audience unintentionally laughing at the cut-off scenes and the cheesy reactions to deaths. The end is very well done . . . until the last five minutes when it uses an unrealistic TV broadcast to give us the information that should have been shown.Now my biased opinion: I'm glad this movie didn't stoop to the wholehearted clichés that critically acclaimed horror movies like The Decent, The Orphanage, and The Mist did. But the lack of advertised gore and the poor storytelling just ruined it for me. Worth my $5? I think I got more satisfaction for my money's worth writing this review than I got out of the movie.It won't rock your world, but it's better than wallowing in boredom. Take it or leave it.2/10",2,0,3,3 September 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," What was the point of this?
","I fell asleep thee times, two different sittings during the day trying to watch this movie the full way through. To say the least, it was absently unnecessary.The action goes from bland to just boring. The directors thought by making things bigger they'd be more interesting, but they were wrong. It just plays out like every action movie you've ever seen, but more boring.Acting is still just as cheesy. The plot is still just as predictable. I don't know how anyone can really take this seriously, considering I couldn't even really take the original seriously, and this is FAR worse than that one.There isn't much more to say. It's terrible. Why is it terrible? Because it's a retread of everything the first movie did sub-par, but this movie now does it horribly. Don't waste your time.1/10",1,3,6,19 September 2008
The Fountain," This makes me wonder if anyone can make good surrealist fiction . . .
","Before you assume I'm one of the countless people who didn't get the plot, thus doesn't like this movie, think again. I understood everything about The Fountain from open to close. Being someone who honestly used to enjoy good surrealist fiction, I hoped this may have been at least worth a watch. And maybe it was. However, the main problem isn't that the movie was too confusing, but rather that it was too elementary.It's almost an unspoken rule among bad surrealist authors and screenwriters: 'If I'm too unintelligent to think of anything but a traditional, clichéd plot, then I have to awe the viewer into thinking I've done something so utterly original and intelligent they don't even realize I just picked up some children's book off my bookshelf and copied it word-for-word.' Darren Aronofsky knows that rule, and he follows it here. It fooled a lot of viewers, but it didn't fool me.The surrealist elements of The Fountain deal with the (presumed) spiritual world of the Garden of Eden. The main character, who is presented as your standard male hero, tries to save his dying wife by finding the Fountain of Youth, aka the Tree of Life in this spiritual world by finding a way to reverse aging in the physical world through medicine. That's the basic synopsis you get from the first fifteen minutes, and that plot takes you up to the last twenty minutes when the results of all this come into place. Without spoiling anything, the ending is traditional and expected, butback to that ruleis laced with some of the most over-the-top surrealist imagery ever put on screen. If you see past the intense flashes of gold light, you'll realize the ending was completely dull and unoriginal. And so was the rest of the movie.So . . .This is the point when it gets hard for me to write a review. Put simply, The Fountain isn't likely going to be in the top 10 worst movie list you've ever seen, but that doesn't mean it isn't bad. Like the rule states, it bashes you over the head with some very pretty environments and some truly emotional-grabbing scenes in order to create a faux sense of awe . . . then nothing. It's like going to a concert and the stage lights are going crazy and the band is tearing up the stage with more energy than anything you've ever seen and the lead singer tells you the meaning to one of their most powerful songs and it hits you hard . . . but they don't sing.Put another way: The Fountain is literally nothing but a small love story with a semi-cliché ending. All the surrealist aspects are throw-away when it comes to the actual plot. They're just a hook. If that's what you enjoy, traditional love stories, then this movie is for you. But if you came here for a deep, intelligent movie, then you're going to be disappointed like I was. I guess I'm trying to instruct you to watch it with low expectations.Other minor complaints/complements: The surrealist aspects really got so over-the-top they were borderline cheesy in more than one part of the movie. They also needed to be shortened by a lot, because they took away from the shallow plotwhich was the director's intention. On the other hand, the casting was very well selected and the acting was solid.The director avoided a lot of obvious things he could have done to cheese this movie up considerablysuch as add pointless nudity or a longer run-timeand that is something else I give him credit for.Overall, worth a watch. Once. You may like it or you may not. It is not the intelligent, original movie that the trailer advertises it is. If anything, it's pretty typical.4/10",4,8,13,30 November 2008
Die Hard," One of the few movies I've seen in a long time that was entertaining.
","I'm not someone who tries to find the good in every movie. People who do that just overrated cinema and praise movies that genuinely were a complete waste of their time. I think that is why I hate most action movies that have been released in the 2000s. With the exception of a handful, it's a common trend for modern action movies to be cliché paint-by-the-number dramas with a few things blowing up in the background. This modern mindset that action movies have to have cliché drama elements or they're somehow worthless is a misconception that I never understood. I'm an action fan. I came for action. I didn't come for an hour and a halfliterally, sometimesof the buff action hero giving long speeches about how much he loves his one-dimensional kid with cancer. In this sense, Die Hard makes the biggest, most recent action blockbusters look pathetic. I'm very happy to write that its main focus is action; the other lame storytelling elements are all expendable.With that said, Die Hard does something else I didn't expect. Something that no one gives it credit for. It's creative. If you look behind the terrorist plot, you'll see Die Hard doing things that no other action movie did before it. For one, it has the 'hero' (who is really more of a pawn than a hero) completely in solitude for most of the movie. In a sense, Die Hard is almost a reverse slasher film. In slasher films the main bad guy kills people and he's never seen on screen until the ending. In Die Hard, the hero kills people and the bad guys have no clue who is doing it. Again, another thing no other action movie has had the creativity to do. Though the overall movie isn't anything entirely new (thus my somewhat low score), there are a hundred other details that make it far superior to the less creative action movies out there.Die Hard also has a hardcore level of intensity that I've seen in very few action movies. It builds on a semi-slow pace that immerses the viewer in realism and allows them to care for the characters. The fact Die Hard can do this without ever once becoming tedious or boring is another aspect movies have lost in modern times. The key is in that there is never once an expendable scene in Die Hard. Every scene adds something to the overall effect of the movie, and without it something would be lacking from the overall effect. In opposite, modern action films pump the movie full of pointless talking scenes and pointless sex scenes and pointless drama scenes that add nothing whatsoever to the overall effect of the movie. Also, Die Hard gives the viewer credit that we understood the plot from the first trailer and doesn't need to sit and explain it any further. Modern action films hardly ever do that. Most recently in The Dark Knight, we had to sit thought an hour and a half of nothing but people discussing the cliché crime plot that we understood in full before we even went into the theater.The directing is also far above average. Coming from the same man who directed Predator, I didn't expect anything less. The directing almost has an epic feel as the camera shows all the necessary rooms of the building without once showing something unnecessary to the overall effect. Again, a trait lost in modern action movies.Overall, this film is a necessary watch for anyone who calls themselves an action fan. It's not a perfect movie, and it's not something completely alien to everything that has been done before, but it's entertaining. I watch at least two movies a day, and I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that I found genuinely entertaining.5/10",5,3,15,20 December 2008
30 Days of Night," Yes it's cliché, but it's still good.
","When I first saw it, I really hated it. And still part of me hates it. I was never a fan of vampire movies; mainly because they're so cheesy. I thought Stephen King's modern-vampire book 'Salem's Lot was decent, but I have never seen a vampire movie that didn't bore me. And I can't say 30 Days of Night changed that, either.The good: - Quite bloody, compared to modern movies. - Camera-work was brilliant. - The premise was brilliant. - The ending was neat.The bad: - The vampires were as cheesy as humanly possible. - I was so bored I almost left the theater. - They couldn't resist using the insanely cliché little girl scene. - The cut-off scenes (and there were quite a few) dumbed it down.Overall: I guess I'm just glad someone made an atmospheric, bloody movie with somewhat of a punk spin to it.4/10",4,1,3,19 September 2008
There Will Be Blood," Oh yes . . . There Will Be Boredom.
","If you find a single cliché-ridden scene in this entire movie even mildly unpredictable, it must surprise you every single time the crap in your toilet magically disappears when you flush it. People like to ironically throw around the mindless phrase that whatever movie was 'and insult to' their 'intelligence'. I have never once stooped so low in a review to say that, but I'm going to go even further here. There Will Be Blood is a downright insult to the intelligence of anyone who has so much as graduated kindergarten. And here is why: First and foremost, every single scene in There Will Be Blood is an unabashed cliché, copy/pasted from other 'epic' (major emphasis on the quotes) movies just like it. From opening to close, there isn't a single thing you wouldn't expect. Calling There Will Be Blood unoriginal is an understatement. Calling it so unoriginal it's a blatant waste of time is a better way to put it. While people say something doesn't have to be original to be goodand there may be some truth thereit's almost impossible to be fully engaged with something you've seen before. It's like repeating a joke a second time: sure, you may laugh, but it's not nearly as funny as it was the first time. Taking the metaphor further, with There Will Be Blood, the joke is 'Why did the chicken cross the road?' It's been said so many times people don't even know why it's funny. The only people who could even remotely find any entertainment value, or, much less, intellectual value, in There Will Be Blood are the fine-wine-sipping, fine-cinema-whores. The kind of people who are so brainwashed into believing every word the critics say is correct, they'd believe the critics no matter how bad a film is. And There Will Be Blood is pretty bad. I mean, seriously, folks, when a movie has to even copy its title (from Saw II's tagline), you really think the directors have enough imagination to even think of a single creative, much less original, idea? Excuse me as I laugh.The second condemning flaw is that the film has no story. It's just the everyday life of an oilman. While I can sometimes appreciate movies about everyday life, the problem here is there is nothing whatsoever remarkable about it. The man's life portrayed is just as dull as my own. It's as dull as your own. It's completely, utterly unremarkable. I'm pretty sure the movie was trying to 'haunt' the viewer with its negativity, as the back cover says. However, as I pointed out above, every problem that goes wrong and is intended to 'disturb' the viewer is 100% cliché and predictable, as well as downplayed without any overt emotion until the very ending. Someone can say it is character driven, but the main character and his son are both, again, cardboard clichés who add nothing to the movie whatsoever. Because of this, the movie just goes on and on without any focus or anything at all worth watching. It takes 1 hour and 3 minutesyes, I timed itbefore anything even remotely, mildly interesting happens, and after that, the movie remains deadpan until the end. This review is actually very hard to write because of the simple fact that the movie is like that old politician phrase: it runs on and on for hours, but never really says anything or does anything. It's a lot like trying to review a 2hr, 30min session of staring at the wall.Other complaints: <ul><li>The cinematography is stunning at the opening. It has an old-fashion look. After the first 20 minutes, however, it completely becomes average. Almost as if it was just a way to hook the viewer, then died off.</li></ul><ul><li>Giving this film an R-rating is completely ludicrous. Despite the title that it directly stole from Saw II, it literally could have been G-ratedthere was no blood, language, or nudity whatsoeverand certainly no worse than PG.</li></ul><ul><li>The acting was nothing special. It's solid, sure. It's average. It's run-of-the-mill. Oscar-worthy? Again, that's a joke. I saw nothing special about any of the performances, and some of them (such as Ailman) were downright cheesy.</li></ul><ul><li>It's always easier for movies like this to portray cliché Christian extremists instead of accurately portraying what 95% of real Christians actually act like. I actually find it rather humorous. I've seen hundreds of films portray Christian extremists, but I can literally count the realistic portrayals of a Christian in a movie on one hand. It's a paradox that There Will Be Blood tries so hard to be realistic, while it uses every over-the-top Hollywood cliché ever used.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending is an absolute safe, self-parody. It's where the entire bland joke-of-a-movie finally gets a punch line. The ending, without spoiling anything, has to be one of the absolute cheesiest endings of all time, not to mention the way it's played out is, who would have guessed, another cliché. I've seen the exact same ending in countless other movies (for example: Hannibal Rising, Hostel: Part 2, etc.).</li></ul>Overall: There is no point of viewing this movie. It's just a rehash of everything you've seen before, with no redeeming value whatsoever. It's bitingly predictable and unoriginal, and you'll see every turn in the first fifteen minutes, like I did. The story is simply nonexistent, and the characters all have about as much personality as a tree stump. This movie is a whitewashed grave: nice cinematography, but once you look past the pretty movie pictures, you see it's dead inside.0/10",6,15,27,10 January 2009
Hancock," At least it tried . . .
","Let me get this out of the way before I bash this movie: the first 2/3ds of Hancock was done flawlessly for what it was trying to accomplish. A nihilistic superhero that cares more about himself than other people. A lot of jokes and events that were slapstick and crude, Pulp Fiction-style. A plot that didn't take itself too seriously, but wasn't so ridicules that the audience couldn't take it seriously at all.Yes, the first 2/3ds of the movie were fun and near flawless, if even a bit, dare I say it, borderline original. Nothing that's going to blow your brain, but still fun and anti-cliché enough to be a fun summer movie.The last 1/3rd of the movie turns into a family-friendly episode of The Twilight Zone as the twists are revealed. All the amazing nihilism disappears, as does the ability to take Hancock seriously as he puts on one of the cheesiest superhero costumes in history. When you see this in the theater it's a lot like a slap in the face, but over time I've grown to understand and like it a little more than I did.The action scenes aren't all that well-done, and neither is the film itself. It seems a lot like a prototype for what could really be a superhero movie, and I think that is what it was going for, and I also think I liked that aspect. It's not as well-done as Spider-Man, and it's not as ridiculously dull as all the other Marvel adaptations lately.I praise Hancock for being a fun, anti-cliché movie with some crude elements to make people like me smile every now and then. Don't judge it as a masterpiece, because it never tried to be one in the first place.5/10",5,0,1,6 September 2008
WALL·E," Pixar knows how to preach clichés, but makes little effort to entertain.
","Wall-E is just sadly typical. There is nothing that hasn't been done time and time again in animated films, and then it just added on a cliché social commentary that really ruined the entire film for me.Hollywood, even Pixar, simply do not understand entertainment value anymore. Action movies have turned into Lifetime TV dramas with something blowing up every now and then, horror movies have to be straightforward and predictable or they're labeled as 'lacking quality', dramas lack realism, and originality in every drama is simply dead. But more obvious than any of those problems is the lack of ENTERTAINMENT movies have. If a movie doesn't pack a cliché commentary about the human condition, it's seen as pulp and pointless. In order to preach these cliché morals that we've known since we were old enough to talk, the entertainment value drops considerably, if not diminishes completely. And that has officially bled over into animated movies, with Wall-E carrying the cliché banner high.I'll admit, when I first saw Wall-E I enjoyed it. Mostly. Wall-E himself is pretty cute. The adventure is giant and fun, and the love story was pretty nicely done, if not a little too predictable. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and shows a major improvement over the past attempts Pixar has put out. But there was hardly any humor whatsoever, the story was stale and predictable, and a lot of the movie was just uninteresting. But, as I said, the thing about Wall-E that just really bothered me was how much of the entertainment value was sucked dry to give us a social commentary that you've seen preached on the news stations every morning when you wake up. We're fat, we're using up our resources, we're polluting our planetgreat, fine, we KNOW that. We don't need a G-rated family movie trying to bash us over the head with it, what we need is a movie that is actually entertaining in a era when movies simply don't understand what 'entertainment value' means.Overall, I think this is one of Pixar's better efforts, but certainly not up to the perfection a many people seem to think it is. Not even close.5/10",4,4,12,21 September 2008
Scream," I expected more . . .
","Scream had an amazing point behind it, and I am glad that it was one of the first films to deliberately stand up for originality. With that said, ironically, the reason I didn't like it was because it was just a typical slasher with something to say instead of something to rip-off.The kill scenes were all well done and some of them were downright iconic. But they were few and far between, with way too much bloated dead space between them. I'll never understand why action movies and horror moviestwo genres that are meant to thrill youalways seem to think they have to throw in yet another overdone woman's channel drama, and that is one cliché Scream doesn't break out of, sadly. The drama takes up way too much screen time and dulled the amazing intro and secondary kill scenes. This would have been a near perfect movie if they would have just stuck to the horror.The blood is pretty minimal, and not really even up to the bar set by the older slashers mentioned in the movie. However, some of the kills were more intense than normal slashers.As all of you should already know, the main point to have made Scream is to show that movies were cliché and predictable without turning into one of those movies itself. I think it does that wonderfully, but a little bit more on the subject would have made it more solid, because some people didn't even catch that was the point of the movie.In the end, Scream is just another typical slasher played out on a anti-cliché soapbox. I expected a lot more from it, and I still see no reason for the boring drama scenes that played out through most of the middle. It's a must view for any serious horror fans, but don't expect to be amazed like I was.2/10",2,2,10,7 September 2008
Halloween," An unbiased review.
","There is a major difference between having respect for a film and being truly captivated by a film. Respect is simply realizing the importance a film had to cinema, or a certain genre, and admiring it for what it was in its time. Captivation is when you watch a film and are truly amazed by what you have just witnessed: in result, you think about it for days; you buy wallpaper with the main character printed on it; you give it a perfect score; it becomes a part of your life. With that said, let me briefly talk about the two main groups that make up the Halloween fan-base.Group (1) watched the film when they were 4-years-old or when it first came out, went in their pants, and then childishly force the biased idea that it's THE scariest movie of all time into the heads of everyone who is even a mild horror fan. Because of nostalgia, they ignore the fact that Halloween is just a generic killer-in-the-house movie, even in its time, and place it high above anything and everything that has come out in the horror genre afterward. It doesn't matter how original or intelligent a modern horror movie is, in their mind, by God, it can't touch Halloween. Funny, though, if you ask them 'Why?', they can never answer you. Group (2) watched the film in their teen years, thought in the back of their heads that Halloween was nothing special, but gave it perfect scores out of pure respect and duty. Group (3) is rare, but it's the few who saw it recently and genuinely thought it was a superior film, without being biased by positive scores. Group (4), which I include myself in, is completely middle-ground. They realize the most of the film is nothing special, but there are enough cool elements to keep them from saying its pure crap.The reason I bring up the fans is because it's a subject that no one really wants to talk about, but a subject that is very important when analyzing the film. With millions of 'Perfect!' opinions beating down on you, honestly realizing the mediocrity of Halloween isn't an easy thing to write in a review.The main reason Halloween isn't as great as it's hyped to be is the core story. A juggernaut killer kills. Point blank: it's generic, unoriginal, and just downright boring, even in its time. As citation, the year before Halloween came out, Stephen King expressed in an introduction that he was sick of 'generic killers' and that he could 'write this in' his 'sleep'. (Note: This was not in response to Halloween or any other movie, but his personal feelings.) When I look at Halloween as a story and as a story alone, I cannot give it any credit whatsoever. It's pathetic. It's painfully unoriginal. Much more complex and original horror stories were told in the '70s. For one, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ('74). Another, Alien ('79). Another, The Shining novel ('77). Another, Carrie ('76). Halloween, in comparison to its peers, is just primitive in the way of plot, and that's the main reason I cannot give it a higher score. Some inaccurately credit it for starting the slasher sub-genre, but because it didn't, I can't even give it story credit for that.However, the reason I don't dismiss the movie as a total waste of time is because of the atmosphere and directing. John Carpenter doesn't quite reach the perfection here with these two elements that he later reached with The Thing, but it's still impossible to ignore how superior they are in Halloween. The opening sequence with Michael as a child is absolutely brilliant. It pays homage to Black Christmas ('74) by doing a first-person view of the killer, then takes it even further with a third-person view afterward. The Halloween night atmosphere isn't quite done to absolute nostalgic perfection, but it's done better than any other movie I've seen. The camera angles, the reveals of the killer, the shadowed faces—all clichés to us now, but this was the movie where most of them originated. And it did all of this without cheese. This aria is where Halloween deserves its credit.With that said, Halloween really isn't scary at all unless you grew up with it. Even in its time, it was a generic killer-in-the-house film, and, as I've read some reviews state, it wasn't scary even on its release night. As for gore, I'm not even sure I saw a single drop of blood in the entire film, and that got a little cheesy. The acting is also borderline cheesy at points, but nothing too distracting. What is distracting, however, is the lack of action for most of the screen time does get very boring. It is obvious Carpenter is trying to make up care for the characters by showing up drawn-out bits of their lives, but that doesn't work because they're all just cardboard, personality-less people. Halloween does get boring.I never write reviews based on my respect of a film, but rather on my view of a film. Halloween deserves the credit it receives. I won't deny that. What I will deny is that this is the scariest movie of all time, or even one of them. What I will deny is that this is the be-all-end-all horror movie, because there are far more intelligent and original horror movies out there. What I will deny is that Halloween is the ascension to heaven that the brainwashed fanboys make it out to be.3/10",3,7,16,25 February 2009
The Silence of the Lambs," There are many different kinds of cheese. And in this case, mold isn't a good thing.
","Ever since I was a little kid, I was obsessed with reading pulp horror. I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is: a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the 'perfect' horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this 'impossible-to-miss!' film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable. And here is why . . .First and foremost: The Silence of the Lambs is, unarguably, 100% unoriginal. There is not a single original—or even creative—concept in the entire runtime of the film. This paragraph of my review is not my opinion. The way I view the world has no bearing on what has or hasn't been done in storytelling before. Saying that it's my opinion that The Silence of the Lambs is unoriginal is equivalent to saying that it's my opinion that the sky is blue. And just as childish. With that said, I can literally point you, scene-by-scene, to where every single idea in The Silence of the Lambs has been written and filmed in the past. Dressed to Kill, for a major example. From the formula, to the characters, to the situations, to the set-up: it's all, unarguably, one giant genre cliché. And, as I said, I can point to every movie, every book that has used the EXACT scenes in the past. This isn't just a coincidence; it's an unabashed lack of creativity and intelligence from the writer. Just more of the same cliché Hollywood and pulp fiction conventions we've seen all our lives. All the standard clichés are here, folks: romantic subplot, tension at the agency, troubled childhoods, etc., etc., etc.Hannibal Lector himself is, admittedly by the author, nothing but a mash-up of various fictional and real-life serial killers. The two most obvious fictional killers he unabashedly rips-off are Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974) and Mark Lewis (Peeping Tom, 1960). Leatherface's actions (cannibal, wears victim's faces) + Lewis's mind (pretentious, psychiatrist, study's human behavior, kills people to study reactions, gives long speeches about serial killers, has a supposed vast knowledge of the human mind) = Hannibal Lector. There is not a single character trait that Lector has that wasn't done nearly 40 years before he was written. Again, a kindergarten lack of creativity. I honestly don't even know how his character got past copyright laws.Not to mention Hannibal's cheesy persona. He pronounces 'liver' with slurping sounds at the end. So did 3-year-olds, but I don't cower in fear of them. He never actually DOES anything on-screen, except talk. And talk. And when he does talk, he talks with the pseudo-intelligence of a high-school dropout who took a semester of psychology. Why? Because his psychological knowledge is laughably limited, and sometimes incorrect all together. He's supposed to be this oh-so-evil genius, but all he ever does is quote cliché phrases from dumbed-down Freud. He knows NOTHING about psychology. The pathetic writers just wrote enough cliché psychobabble between his laugh-out-loud cheesy slurping sounds to make it seem like he knew at least as much about the human mind as the average middle-school student. And then, just like all over-glamorized Hollywood, every time Hannibal is on the screen they point the camera up at his face with light shining behind his head as he stares at the ceiling without blinking. That's not good acting. That's made-for-TV directing they use in low-budget Jesus movies. Hannibal Lector is nothing but an awkward middle-aged man who is obsessed with talking and breaking copyright laws. How is that unnerving? If I met him, I'd laugh in his face and tell him to grow up.So, at root value, I'm just trying to ask: What is so great about this movie? It's a generic crime thriller. It opens up with a generic cop-meets-killer scene, and ends with a generic cheesy-killer-in-the-house scene. Everything in between is exactly what you'd expect from an over-glamorized generic Hollywood thriller. It has NO significance whatsoever when it comes to originality. And as far as entertainment value goes, I don't see what's so entertaining in watching a middle-age man talk for an hour on end. If that entertains you, I pity you.Oh my God! This movie TERRIFIED me! Why? Because an awkward middle-aged man pronounced 'liver' like a 3-year-old.I'll say the same thing to those of you who gave this movie a high score as I'd say to Hannibal Lector: GROW UP.2/10",2,5,20,24 April 2009
Iron Man," Is anyone over the age of five NOT sick of sub-par superhero movies?
","It seems like an obsession with Hollywood to take something intentionally childish and make it 'mature'. You know what I'm talking about. The new Bond movies, the new Batman movies, Transformers, etc., etc. What Hollywood fails to realize is that only one out of every ten movies that follows this style actually ends up being a worthwhile movie.Iron Man is simply one of the nine failures.Outside of the first forty-five minutes, the entire plot line is corny and a wholesale cliché. Elaborating, Iron Man tries to be mature by mixing in the war in the middle-east. It works. That is, it works until the plot turns into the exact same plot as every other sub-par superhero movie out there. It becomes obvious by the first thirty minutes that no good person can die, and all the bad people all cackle oh-so-evilly and have no more intelligence than an average paperweight. By this point you forget the maturity of the movie's opening, and all there is to do is laugh at the impossibly cliché story. It's like watching one of the old cartoons where the good guys always win and the bad guys always have evil-looking beard stubble and talk intelligently only to be slight-handed by the more intelligent good guy. This is the 'mature' superhero movie everyone told me about? But there is a good chance you didn't watch Iron Man for the plot. You watched it for the action. The only problem with that is there is only two action scenesyes, I counted. One in the opening and one in the ending, with a few spurts of action between that last a whole thirty seconds of screen time. The first one is well-done and actually made me think this could be a decent movie. The last, however, is possibly one of the most unintentionally hilarious climactic scenes of all time. Even if I ignore the fact it's almost copy/pasted in entirety from a Mystery Science 3000 episode, some of the worst CGI used since I Am Legend ruins anything cool about it.The space between the two action scenes is filled with some of the most cliché plotting I've seen in years, as I stated above. Put simply, there is nothing entertaining here. While Robert Downey Jr. plays his role perfectly as usual and puts on a pretty nice comedic bit every few scenes, he can't let me forget the sinking feeling in my gut that this is one of the most boring superhero movies ever made.What more is there for me to say? My pretentious critic conclusion: Iron Man is a severely clichéd, technically poor film with little entertainment value.Half-drunk, adverage joe conclusion: Iron Man is boring and lame. No way is this better than The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2! Both are correct. Iron Man has made me personally give up all hope on the superhero genre.0/10",1,17,39,8 December 2008
Blade Runner," Not the generic, cliché film noir the negative reviews wanted, thank God.
","A lot of science fictionfilm, novel, whateverdo nothing but copy each other, then tack on some 'deep' moral or generic social commentary. And they get critically acclaimed for it. The best example of this is Fahrenheit 451, which was simply a generic allegory about censorship with a kindergarten-level plotthat is now taught in our schools as one of the greatest novels of all time. What a joke. Blade Runner, at least in film form, is not like that whatsoever, and that was very refreshing to me. Unlike Fahrenheit 451 and the majority of other sci-fi titles, Blade Runner does not just bank on one moral issue. It doesn't create a world around a single issue (like censorship or the value of life or any other cliché issues sci-fi always repeats), it creates a world with ISSUES. This is why it's such superior as allegorical sci-fi and as film noir.With this world that is so different from any created before it, Ridley Scott's directing really sets the stage. Though I'm not sure Blade Runner can even be mentioned in the same breath as Alien, it's obvious that the two were directed by the same man. Simply put: Ridley Scott pays attention to details that we as an audience will likely only notice subconsciously.The majority of the negative reviews criticize the slow pace, but the slow pace is what makes Blade Runner what it is. It builds the atmosphere, and if you were to take out even a single scene, the overall movie would lack something. Atmosphere is something modern viewers don't understand. There is a major difference between an action movie filling space with twenty minutes of the main charter staring at a wall and another action filling the same amount of time with slow-paced, atmosphere-building scenes. The former is pointless; the latter is intentional and purposeful. For example, look at The Dark Knight. The pacing is no faster than Blade Runner. In fact, the entire first hour and a half was dedicated to nothing but conveying the one-dimensional plot that we all fully understood since we saw the first trailer. Blade Runner, on the other hand, uses just as much time to immerse the viewer in the unconventional city atmosphere. Scott understands when and how to use music and color. He understands when to give a slow pan of the city and when to blast through the city with action. I find it almost hypocritical than people rave for movies like The Dark Knight and Casino Royale then trash Blade Runner for its pacingnone of them get to the action any faster, and that's fact. If you want a fast pace, go watch Saw. If you want atmosphere, watch Blade Runner. I love both styles, and both styles have their place in cinema.The casting is also flawless. Some people have trashed Harrison Ford's performance, but, really, I don't see what he did so wrong. He plays the same character he does in every movie he plays in: a brute, somewhat childish, selfish man. He plays the character traits just as well as he did in Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The other actors all fulfilled their purposes, and I didn't find their performances terrible or great.Though the directing is godly, I don't judge a movie solely based on movie making quality, unlike some mindless people. The story is pretty generic, with some original facets for its time. The somewhat dull plot is the only reason I didn't give this movie a perfect score. A plot twist would really have improved the standard, somewhat predictable formula. With that said, Blade Runner is far from generic sci-fi, as my opening paragraph stated. It's more intelligent than that, but it doesn't get so lost in a social commentary it loses entertainment value. The last twenty minutes reveal the true adrenaline of the story, after the movie-long build up. It's how Scott directs. It's his staple. And it works. And it's entertaining. If you don't enjoy it, then don't watch it. It's taste, not lack of quality or originality or pointless scenes. Overall, this is a must-view for any sci-fi fan. Anyone who is looking for something to at least fill the nostalgia of Alien, watch Blade Runner. It's not perfect, and the shallow plot is a bit disappointing, but it's still awesome in it's own way, and is far above its imitators.5/10",5,0,5,29 November 2008
Casino Royale," Falsely advertised as an action movie.
","If I ever need a movie to point to that did every last thing that make action movies terrible, it is now Casino Royale. It opens with one of the single cheesiest openings I've ever seenBond and some cheesy old guy making death threats in British accentsand in the end you realize there was less action in this movie than an episode of SpongeBob.<ul><li>Yes, Bond is darker. But what Hollywood forgot is when you take a fun, intentionally cheesy franchise like this and try to make it grim and menacing it doesn't work. The reason it doesn't work is because it's like dressing up a little girl as a serial killerit's cute, not threatening. In this case, it dulls down everything Bond has done in the past. The Bond series was meant to be a fun action movie with lots of explosions and shootouts, not a drama like Casino Royale that only literally has two main action scenes. Yes it's darker, but it's also a movie I couldn't take seriously at all because it tries to be cheesy and hardcore at the same time.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot. Terrorists, blah, money, blah, cliché, blah, I've seen this so many times I feel like shooting my eyes out, blah. As many terrorist movies there are, you'd think 90% of the human population is a terrorist. I have nothing more to say about that. Isn't there something more interesting for Bond to kill? - The villain is pure cheese, yet the movie wants us to take him seriously. Fake eye, bleeding eye, deformed bottom lip, British accent, wears a Dr. Evil jumpsuit through parts of the movieyup, he passes as the most cliché action villain of all time. Once again, the movie wants to be dark but elements like this just downright kill that. Entirely. Every time he came on the screen I laughed. I couldn't help it.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie does not stop talking! I will never understand why directors of ACTION movies throw in hours of talking that BORES the FANS who give them MONEY for no reason at all. If I wanted to hear talking, I'll go to the coffee shop. If I want an action movie, I'll watch things blow up. Why must there be so much pointless talking? Characters in Casino Royale talk and talk until I was ready to scream at them to shut up and turn the movie off. What are they talking about? I have no clue. Some crap about how your mother is a terrorist, or how goldfishes may be terrorists, or terrorists are terrorists, terrorists . . .</li></ul>Overall, Daniel Craig is the best Bond and I think a darker tone could work in the future, but it doesn't work here. Casino Royale is not an action movie, being there are only two scenes of action in the whole movie and the rest is playing cards and talking. This is my least favorite Bond movie and my least favorite action movie of all time. At least the Bond video games are still fun and have superior (and less cheesy) writing/scripts to the films. And I just find it just downright sad that is how low this series, and action movies in general, have come.1/10",1,5,14,18 September 2008
Trainspotting," Like the main character, I just don't care.
","If a middle-aged man were to walk outside his house right now in a chicken suit and started attacking small children, a lot of people would say he lacks maturity. Or, perhaps, that he's a pervert. If he sustained his attack long enough, he'd be on the news, and the police would come, handcuff him, and laugh in the guy's face. Lack of maturity is something that is obviously negative in out society. What I find interesting, though, is: what is labeled as immaturity in real life is labeled as sublime quirkiness on the movie screen. Sometimes. Other times, in case of shows like The Wiggles, immaturity is labeled as stupid. Other times, in case of comedies, immaturity is labeled as hilarious. Other times, in case of books like Naked Lunch, immaturity is labeled as offensive. Other times, in case of movies like Trainspotting, immaturity is just generic, boring, and I've seen this so many times I know exactly what's going to happen in five minutes, oh look! I was right.I'll just get right to my point. Trainspotting is one of the most unoriginal movies I've ever seen in my life. From the opening surrealist toilet scene (which was used in everything from video games to books to artwork to cartoons long before Trainspotting was even an idea in the writer's head) to the childish DRUGS ARE REALLY, REALLY BAD!!! ending and everything between those two points.The nihilistic characters are trite and safe, copy/pasted from some MTV reality show that contains 2% reality and 98% what looks cool. Their generic nihilistic actions are so safe, most eight-year-old boys would think they're lame, but, for some reason, the middle-aged crowd calls them 'intelligent'. The entire drug-addiction plot line plays out exactly like it did in that DRUGS ARE REALLY, REALLY BAD!!! video you had to watch in high school health class.My point? It takes a lot more to shock people than a couple kids playing around in a toilet. There is absolutely nothing disturbing here whatsoever. Why? Because this is the pansy crap we see every single anti-drug movie ever made. It's so unabashedly unoriginal, I fail to see how anyone can even call it art, being that the definition of art is 'an original body or work' . . .The cinematography is generic, and is only even slightly inspired when it rips-off Kubrick. The acting is generic, being that I don't think it's hard for a young twenty-something to act as a young twenty-something. I don't even know why they even bothered giving the characters names, because they completely lack any sort of identity that real people have. The only identity they have is that, they're boring, flat, copy/paste characters who are addicted to heroin . . . and they do heroin . . . yeah. And even if people say this lack of identity originality is the point of the movie—which it's not—then I'll say back, Brent Easton Ellis' novel Less Than Zero did that exact thing ten years before this movie came out and seven years before Welsh's book came out, and it did it infinitely better and more realistically than either one.If you liked Trainspotting, I pity you.2/10",7,16,34,15 November 2009
Signs," Fun, I guess.
","It's nothing amazing, but it's better than a lot of what is out there on a technical level.There were heartwarming moments and tense moments, but it never got too boring. It understood entertainment, and that's really all it was. Some people could be put off by the ending, but that ending has been done so many times I'm not sure why people even care.The only thing about the movie that really bugs me was the alien. At that point, the movie completely ruined any and all suspense and atmosphere it worked so hard to build. As if we haven't seen enough humanoid aliens in the past, whereas superior alien films, like Alien, work to go against what we already think we know and redesign it. The fact this film was so essentially safe really annoyed me.Can't really say much because there isn't really a plot other than what the title implies. Nothing even remotely original or scary, but it was fun to watch.3/10",3,3,5,3 September 2008
The Sixth Sense," Only spectacular if you're not a horror buff who's seen old ghost movies.
","I'm not the biggest Shyamalan fan by any means. Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothingminus the plot twist, I guessthat makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything.However, there is some good. Mainly being that The Sixth Sense was one of the few groundbreaking American horror filmsand yes, it is drama/horror, not a thrillerthat brought some weight to the genre. While the majority of horror films in the '90s just focused on cheesy scares, Shyamalan focused on fine detailed, believable, high-quality scares that made the genre cinematic and not just laughable. With that said, The Sixth Sense, like most horror movies, just isn't very scary. A lot like the original Saw was a thriller set in a horror universe, The Sixth Sense is a drama set in a horror universe.That brings out a lot of problems, however. For one, The Sixth Sense follows the same cliché formula a lot of Stephen King novels do: heavy doses of drama, with short bursts of horror scattered throughout. That just makes the already deeply unoriginal movie feel even worse because it makes it very boring. The attention to detail I mentioned above as a complement is also a major complaint.Shyamalan's directing/writing skills are both probably both at their best here on a technical level (if you ignore the unoriginality). There wasn't a single shot in the movie that wasn't effectively done, and the plot is laid out well. The plot twist ending brought the plot twist ending into the mainstream, and it's very well done, but still a little cliché. The plot twist has been used in a lot of urban legends before, as well, if I remember right, on The Twilight Zone a few times.So, in the end, it just left me with mixed feelings. On one hand I want to praise the movie for being so well done, but on the other hand I want to trash it for the lack of anything that sets it overall apart from every other ghost story out there. Everything was so predictable.Let this be a lesson to all of you who say a movie can be a good movie even if it's unoriginal: you're wrong. Without originality, you're just left with no mystery, and just left feeling: 'Eh, whatever. Didn't I see that before somewhere?' And that last thought is exactly my final opinion on the insanely overrated The Sixth Sense. But at least it wasn't as godawful as The Happening, right? 1/10",1,1,7,1 November 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," What could be more overrated than this?
","The other day some friends told me they didn't watch horror movie because every one of them was cheesy and predictable. At the time I wasn't exactly sure what they were watching to make them think that, but now I know: A Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't care if it's a classic, it's still one of the single worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I don't understand how this is by the same man who wrote The Last House on the Left, which was superior in every way imaginable.To call this movie cheesy is an understatement. From opening to closing the acting is some of the unintentionally funny I've seen in a horror movie eversome of the melodramatic lines I'm sure Wes Craven had to have laughed at when he wrote them, I'm sure.The entire movie plays out like something made-for-TV on Cartoon Network, and they actually show this movie on that station around Halloween. There is nothing even remotely dark or serious about this movie because it's written with the simplicity and corniness of a children's film. The actors themselves don't even look old enough to be teenagers. Minus the cliché, comical bedroom scene near the end, the movie has no more blood than a kid's movie. I really cannot think of ANYTHING in this movie that would be aimed at adults or older teensA Nightmare on Elm Street is a children's movie through and through.The story itself is throw-away and lacks any creativity whatsoever. A guy kills in your dreams. Other than that, every single factor of A Nightmare on Elm Street uses clichés that were around long before it. A secondary character dies off, the main character goes on a quest to kill the killer, the main character goes to school and almost is killed, the main character does research and finds an urban legend (or the equivalent) on how to kill the supernatural killer, her plan succeeds, and the last few minutes show a reversal of expectations. Anyone remember how many times they've seen that exact plot before? If I were to list the movies on the top of my head with that same plot it would take at least two pages. Those of you who claim this is a superior slasher because it's 'original' do not know what original means.Freddy is the single thing that even kept me watching this movie. His character is a tired clichéexactly like Pennywise and Billy and the Joker and every other villainbut his actual design is at least a little different. He's essentially Mr. Rodgers with a burnt face and knives for fingers, but that is more original than you're going to get in most slashers. It's sad to see him in such a lame movie.The only reason I didn't turn A Nightmare on Elm Street off and go to bed is because every 'hardcore horror fan must watch it' and I did. But I saw nothing different than every other cheese-horror movie ever made. I hope the remake is better. And has less clothing with primary colors.1/10",1,23,50,8 September 2008
The Matrix," Decent story, but it lacked so much quality.
","The Matrix isn't the mind trip that everyone says it is. The story is pretty standard, even a tad cliché. It pretty much takes Alice In Wonderland and makes it slightly more mature, and that is really it. Our world isn't real, but the matrix is real. Okay, so how is that original? The idea has been toyed around with in every single fantasy story since about the time The Chronicles of Narnia was written. I simply do not understand why so many people think that is so originalit's not even close. In essence, it was pretty predictable to me.But my major problem was it was dull. Most of the movie was nothing but your standard fantasy lingo that I've heard so many times I was about to fast forward through it all. 'Our world is real, not yours.' Then, 'But, wait, how can that be?' And so on. I can tell you exactly what was going on in this movie from the first trailer, much less halfway through.Action is minimal. Violence is non-existent. I don't understand why this was rated R, at all, unless the produces paid the MPAA to give it an R-rating so it looked more 'hardcore' than it really is. The few action scenes that did take place were okay, but nothing to phone home about, even when the movie was released.Acting is cheesy. Enough said. A lot of this movie I couldn't even take seriously because the acting was so cheesy. Whoever was in charge of casting for this film really had no idea how to pick solid actors to fill the roles.Overall, I guess it was okay. Pretty average and predictable, just like all the Wachowski brother's movies. It was fun, and better than sitting at home with nothing to do, but I can't say much more than that.3/10",3,3,7,19 September 2008
300," Pretty cute.
","First of all, I'd like to say that I liked this movie. All the bad things I am going to talk about in a second don't mean that I didn't have a decently good time. 300 was enjoyable to an extent. Okay? Here we go.The first big problem with 300 was the cheese. From the opening credits, it relives all doubt you had that this movie is meant to be taken seriously by giving you the cheesiest narrator in nearly a millennium. From that point, it delves into a cheesy butt scene, strait out of something you'd see in a comedy, which got me laughing. And if that wasn't enough to make you wonder if this is the same hardcore action movie that was advertised, the director appeases the penises of horny 12-year-old boys (who have never touched a chick in their lives) and 50-year-old men (who secretly find their wives more boring than the opening of this movie) enough boobs to hold them over through the boring, unnecessary characterization scenes.That in itself is 300's second flaw. Every action movie and their pet cow seem to think they have to characterize their characters. Okay, pause with me for a second. When was the last time you saw a standard action movielike thiswhere you actually remembered the name of the main character, much less the names of the secondary characters and the names of the secondary character's wives and children? I can't, and I doubt you can either. We don't see action movies for characters, we see them for action. The characters are fodder. They die. We don't care. What we do care about is seeing the next pointless character explode and his guts go all over the screen, but somehow action movie directors don't understand their audience. Directorslike Zack Snyderassume they have to be 'good storytellers' and take up 30 to 50 minutes of screen time to give their characters have some sort of characterization. The problem with that is the characterization is always shallow and they end up characterizing a cliché that is flatter than if they hadn't take up all that time to characterize. In the end, it leaves you bored and you STILL can care less about the characters. 300 does this exact thing, just like every other action movie on the planet. The action scenes are few and far between. Most of the screen time is characterizing, and I still could care less who lived and who died. All I wish is action directors would LISTEN to their FANS and stop using this clichéd, pointless method. If 300 was nothing but battle from opening to closing, I would have given it a higher score, but I can't because of the lame, boring attempt ad characterization.The third main flaw with 300 is the lack of blood. I heard from all my friends that this was a gorefest, but it wasn't even close to one. Even the back cover promises 'BLOOD, thunder, and awe'. But where was the blood? I saw a few dots of it every few minutes, but nothing more. The decapitations, for God's sake, didn't even have any blood! People are stabbed, shot with arrows, cut apartbut all the most blood that is show is a few dots flying across the screen. If it was up to me, I would have EASYLY given this a PG-13 rating.Forth main flaw was the battle scenes themselves. Whoever honestly thinks these are some of the most epic battle scenes of all time are joking. The battle scenes are very stylish and fun, but to call them intense or epic is a joke. Compared to LotR: Return of the King, the battles seem minute. Compared to CoN: Prince Caspian, the battles seem slow-paced and lack any intensity at all. Compared to Braveheart, the battle scenes seem tame. With that said, I like them better than most of those simply because they were stylish and fun and visually pleasing, but they were nowhere near truly epic. A lot of them were small enough to have taken place in my backyard. The vast, expansive Persian army was broken up into bite-sized groups in every single battle, never once attacking with full force. Sorry, but that just seemed lame to me.Overall, though, my opinion is positive. All the things I just pointed out could be overlooked if you had fun, and I did. After so many boring action movies this side of the new millennium, this one really stands out, even though it is pretty typical. It's visually stunning, and it isn't as toned down as it could have been. Just grab some friends and have funif you try taking this movie seriously you'll hate it. The story is cute, the action is fun and refreshing, some of the characters are memorable, and it has a nice soundtrack. If I wanted to, I could tear this movie apart even further with criticism, but I'm not going to. It's a breath of fresh air for the action fan, even if it's nothing new or innovative.4/10",4,0,1,17 September 2008
Sin City," So ridiculously typical.
","The art style and film-making are truly a masterpiece. The story itself is dull, lame, predictable, cliché, and in the end 100% forgettable.I'll start with the action. To be blunt, there is hardly any at all. When the action happens it is lame and uninspired. It reminded me of dumbed down action scenes from Spider-Man, but even that is too much of a complement. Most of the film is nothing but people walking around and talking about things that make no difference.So, with all the talking scenes and characterization scenes you'd expect the plot to be, you know, at least a plot. Oh, how wrong that assumption is. There is no plot. The mini stories that somehow are kind of a plot mixed together are generally boring, and entirely cliché. You've seen these mini stories on cartoons before.But it doesn't even have the same level of fun, original cartoony feel. It's more like a bad cartoonlike Tom and Jerrythat has grown up but never matured. It just feels . . . awkward and boring. Like a 40-year-old man doing something like a 5-year-old. It's just lame.This style of mature cartoony-fantasy has been NAILED in video games like Killer 7, which hone the originality and innocence of cartoons, but mix it with mean-spirited ultra-violence. Movies like Kill Bill also get it down. But Sin City simply doesn't know how to do that in a way that isn't boring and cliché.But, as I said, it's truly a masterpiece in style. Too bad that style wasn't used for something original and cliché-defining, instead of a lame Spider-Man wannabe with some dumbed-down blood to make it seem action packed when I've seen more action watching people walk by my back yard.. . . and I wish I was joking.1/10",1,1,8,31 August 2008
Donnie Darko," When weird stops being weird.
","It never ceases to amaze me how people think they're being original when they're really notoftentimes they're following the oldest clichés without even realizing. Donnie Darko suffers from this, like most every movie in this somewhat overdone sub-genre. More about that in a second.The sub-genre I'm referring to is the wannabe The Twilight Zone episodes turned into full length movies. Pretty much everything M. Night Shyamalan has written fits here, as well as Big Fish, The Invisible, The Cell, Donnie Darko, The Matrix, etc. But what confuses me is all the movies in this sub-genre forget the others exist and act as if they're the only one who has treaded the overdone 'weird' path. In this sense, Donnie Darko is just as typical as the pointless movies released every year.With that said, I liked Donnie Darko. I liked it because some scenes were absolutely beautiful and captivating, like the movie theater scene, the hit-by-a-car scene, and all the little hilarious details that I'm not going to bother mentioning. I liked the editing. I thought the relationship between Donnie and his girlfriend was well done, for the most part . . .. . . but like a sledgehammer to the balls, the writer/director decided to use two of the most common clichés ever used in movies like this. Not only that, but he sacrificed such a likable and original movie because he didn't have the common knowledge to make the mundane original, not just the over-the-top elements: - First, he makes Donnie have mental problems. According to the Unoriginal Hollywood Hand Guide of America, if your main character has fantastic visions he has to have mental problems; if your main character has super intelligence, he has to have mental problems. From an entertainment standpoint, this movie would have been so much more entertaining to watch if I didn't have to keep thinking: 'Wow, another scene with him acting like a retarded person . . .' every five minutes. It ruins the beauty entirely. It ruins the ability to take Donnie seriously, even after his visions prove to be real. From a critical standpoint, it's ridiculously sad that a movie with this much originality would use such a tired cliché that every movie uses. Why couldn't Donnie have just been a normal kid? That alone would have made this movie so much more enjoyable and original.<ul><li>Second, the ending. *Major spoilers* Donnie goes back in time to commit suicide. *End spoilers* Once again, this is the cheap, childish, cliché ending that every movie uses. When you're watching a Twilight Zone wannabe movie, this kind of ending is the single most generic ending there is. You expect it from the first five minutes. Through the entire movie I kept hoping Donnie Darko wouldn't end up with such a cliché finale, but it did. I assume it's a misunderstood idea that all intellectuals must be pessimistic, and all intellectual movies must end with a generic tragedy. If a movie is truly intellectual, you'd think it would break this pathetic trend.</li></ul><ul><li>Third, the subject matter of this movie is just as generic as the other two points I mentioned. Time travel. The movie is obviously trying to be weirdly intellectual, but, really, there is nothing intellectual about the same exact arguments in every single movie like this: time travel, the fabric of destiny, and the clichéd argument of God vs. free will. Once again, a truly intellectual movie would have thought of something new to argue about, but this movie follows the exact same formula as every other movie of its kind.</li></ul>Overall, Donnie Darko (the movie, not the character) flirts with perfection so many times it's sad I have to give it a rating as low as this. But, listen up future directors, it becomes so pretentious by thinking it is so original, and parts truly were, that is ignores glaring clichés that break the rest of the movie. It's sad to see what could have been a truly superior film fall to mediocrity.4/10",3,11,20,3 September 2008
The Birds," Pretty average, minus the intensity.
","Hitchcock isn't necessarily the amazing director everyone credits him as. Of the films I've seen by him, all of them were boring and never gave the 'suspense' that everyone also credits him for. Far better and more original directors have been bashed and hated by critics and never once recognized for what they do. That said, Hitchcock was solid and has some nifty camera angles that do make his films much more unnerving and intense than a good chunk of modern horror.The movie itself must have been amazing in its time. A lot of R-rated movies today are tamer than this PG-13 rated movie, and nowhere near as intense. The bird animations are laughable, the first hour gives boring a new definition, the acting and dialog are trite and sillybut it's hard to call this a bad movie.The lack of music and the camera style both reek of realism, and that's a very good thing. The scares and intensity of the last 30 minutes are hard to match if you aren't laughing at the bird animations. Add a couple weird-out moments and an ending so open it's effective, and you have a solid movie. I'd go as far as to say it's superior to the modern movie The Mist.If the remake keeps all the positives and makes it less cheesy I don't see how any horror fan could dislike it.2/10",2,5,16,3 September 2008
Evil Dead II," I guess you could have some fun . . .
","Evil Dead 2, to be blunt, lacks anything and everything that made the original good. That is not to say that it's bad, because it's not, but compared to the original this just looks like a pathetic attempt to rewrite what was already done. If I hadn't seen the first oneand it really doesn't matter if you have or not because there is no plotI would have liked this a lot more, but because I have, this looks, as I said, pathetic.I don't think Sam Raimi realized that the original was the perfect comedy because it didn't try to be a comedy. His obvious attempt to make this a comedy made it less funny than the original. He lost the element of surprise, which is disappointing. Instead, this movie plays out like a mix between Ghostbusters, The Evil Dead, and an episode of Tom and Jerry. It no longer stands on its own two feet, which is another reason it isn't nearly as good as the first.Another major flaw is the lack of gore. What happened? I'm a gore-hound. I've seen the goriest movies ever made, and camera cut-off scenes make me mad. The original was easily one of the goriest movies of the 80's, and it could even hold up to some of the top-gore movies of the 2000s. But then Evil Dead 2 comes along and the only on-screen gore is a bloodless decapitation. After that, EVERY gore scene, every limb severing, everything is off-camera. Sure, you see a bit of blood every now and then as an aftereffect, but why couldn't they show decapitations and limb severing on camera anymore? Once again, the lack of gore is so obvious it had me screaming at the screen in rage. What happened? What was Sam Raimi thinking? With all that said, I'm not going to deny there were some purely awesome scenes in the beginning and somebut very fewin the middle and end. Dead by dawn, chainsaw for and arm, the laughing houseit was great to see how all those clichés originated. Apparently this film is more groundbreaking than I had known.But then again, this seems so safe compared to the original. So clean. Everything that made The Evil Dead laughably disturbing is noticeably gone (like the tree rape). As I said, the violence is noticeably gone. All the cheese-creepy visuals, like the amount of zombie-demon-things on screen laughing, are gone. What's left is pretty much a safe attempt at black comedy, minus the black. And that's disappointing.As much as I trash it, I still think it's worthy of being watched, though not a worthy sequel. Just grab your girlfriend or your 12-year-old son or a group of best friends and try to have the best time you can. But if you can't have that fun because you realize this movie isn't even deserving of licking The Evil Dead's bloody boots, I can't blame you.5/10",5,2,6,2 September 2008
V for Vendetta," Cute rip-off Orwell's 1984, but seriously, come on now. In the top 250 movies ever made? Excuse me as I laugh.
","I can't point to a single film by the Wachowski brothers that wasn't cheesy, over-hyped, unoriginal, and just downright pathetic. I guess the first Matrix film was alright, but that's the closest they have ever gotten to deserving even half the acclaim they get from mindless 'fine cinema'-whores. Or, in other words, 'People who do not have the ability to disagree with the critics, because they have no brain to make their own judgments.' If they critics call it original and daring, they call it original and daring, even though they've seen a hundred other movies just like it. That is the only reasonable explanation I can see for the mass love for this film.Here are my ABCs of V for Vendetta: A for Annoying. The directing and camera-work are so bland and typical I felt like I was watching a children's TV show. The two main leads are okay acting, but every single secondary character, EVERY single one, are so bad at acting I occasionally had to pause the movie so I could stop and laugh. And I'm not someone who usually cares about bad actingthis was just terrible. What also annoyed me was the level of pure cheese the movie carries and sustains. Gunshots don't bleed, typical stabbings are off-screen, and even some fistfights are off screen. It just added to the children's TV show feel the directing and acting started. How did this movie get and R-rating? I've seen PG-13 movies (like Cloverfeild and The Dark Knight) that have more violence/blood than V for Vendetta. The MPAA puts this on the same level as Saw III and Hostel: Part II? Dear God, our rating system is so screwed up it's not even funny. V for Vendetta did not deserve and R-rating by any means, and I think they honestly slipped the MPAA a little cash to rate it such.B for Boring. Just so anyone out there who hasn't seen this yet knows: this is not an action movie. If anything, V for Vendetta is a political drama. There are maybe two main action sequences that last about five minutes each, and the rest of the runtime is old men rambling about terrorists. The plot is no more complex than you're standard, cliché James Bond plot: terrorist appears, and old men with guns talk about him for the majority of the movie, then in the last ten minutes when the 'climax' starts they finally stop talking about the terrorist and try to do something. In V for Vendetta, when I say the majority, probably 95%, of the movie is nothing but repeated dialogue, I mean it literally. If you were to fast-forward through all the all talking scenes, you'd still understand the plot because it's so generic. You'd also have a fifteen-minute long movie.C for Cliché. As I said, the plot is a rip-off of the books that ripped-off 1984. Giant speakers, evil dictator, TVs used to make mass announcements, people have no freedom . . . blah, cliché, blah, blah. V leaves a rose after he kills, just like every cliché 'sentimental' killer in movie history. The reason he wears a mask and why he seeks vengeance is also the biggest cliché in movie killer history. Also, the 'government lies' jokes were so cliché and annoying I was about to turn it off. As if we haven't heard a thousand times that the government is evil! The movie doesn't even give the audience credit for having basic intelligence of political issues. I cannot name a single aspect of this movie that was original, or even close. The entire movie is the biggest cliché ever.Overall, V for vendetta is a waste of time. It is just a boring drama with a cliché 'moral' that we've heard all our lives. Sure, V himself is cool for a few minutes, but when you realize the knives he carries are just a sales gimmick because there is less action than you could see walking down the street, just know I told you so.1/10",1,63,136,1 October 2008
The Godfather," The irony of being pretentious.
","There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of 'BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME'. You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions—Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others—but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for—the horse—but beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly cliché-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.Perhaps it was very influential in cinema—why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious 'film buffs' claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? 'CLASSIC' is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather—other than the generic 'good plot, good acting, etc.'—is considered so great is, 'BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP.' Maybe what they're really trying to say is, 'I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it.' 4/10",10,3,10,3 March 2009
