Alien 3," One of the Finest and Dramatic Films of the Alien Series
","Can it get any better? No, because Alien 3 goes all the way to all lengths. Alien 3 is set on a planet nicknamed Fury 16, where the Sulaco is attacked by a Facehugger hitchhiker who's acid blood causes the ship to presume a fire has broken out, and so fires it's crew out in an EEV, as well as the Facehugger stray. Alien 3 has a superb story, and is much more darker and crude than the others of it's series, with brilliant beginnings and shows more about the Xenomorph than we could ever learn. Without this film, we'd have no PredAlien! The film is dramatic, intense and creepy, with a more sinister and aggressive Xenomorph variant in - the Runner, or 'Dog-Born Warrior'. The most dramatic scene is possibly the ending, warning, spoilers ahead! Ripley commits suicide as she falls dramatically, in slow motion, down into the flames of a boiler as the Queen attempts to escape. Alien 3 is amazing and intense, maybe the best of the Alien series, but in no way superior to Aliens, in my personal opinion.",9,1,2,14 October 2010
Twilight," Vampires don't Sparkle, sorry.
","As if the books were bad enough, now a film. This film has just attracted squealing annoying fangirls to our cinemas and all we hear now on the internet is 'Edward/ Jocob/ Bella is so hawwwwwt'. Twilight is not good at all, why? Firstly, The vampires themselves have been badly designed, as Vampires do not Sparkle in the sun. Also Vampires, since the time of Dracula, have been known to have 'No feelings, especially love'. The film itself is just a very poor excuse at matching Vampires, a horrific blood sucking beast, with romance, a teenage fantasy. A better film than this would be The Lost Boys, which makes Vampires how they should be.",1,9,12,14 October 2010
