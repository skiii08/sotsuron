Iron Man 3," From great begins come total rubbish!
","Missed this at the cinema due to health reasons so Pre ordered it on blu ray! What a disappointment :( it was the most drab incoherent movie I have seen in years, I have been a massive iron man fan for over 30 years and the first movie was fantastic, then the 2nd came out and again not quite up to the first but really entertaining all the same! Then out came the Avengers and blew my mind so you can see how excited I was at the prospect of the third movie and boy was I disappointed it was mediocre at best I have actually sold the movie on as unlike the other 2 movies I know I will never watch it again it was that bad. I just hope they sort out a new director for the next movie as I won't be taking a risk on the next movie as it is I think I will wait for it to come out as a rental first.",1,2,6,18 November 2013
