Resident Evil: Afterlife," Braaains! We waaant braaains!
","Alice is trying to track a broadcast from some place called 'Arcadia' which promises shelter and sanctuary from the T-virus and the zombified. She believes there may be other survivors there. Her adventure while on this quest forms the essential body of the movie. Her main adversary is the head of the Umbrella Corporation in Tokyo. This is some guy so hopped up on T-virus that he's gone Matrix on everybody's ass. I swear, he acts like a refugee from the movie.My Impression: The movie was entertaining with impressive sets and visuals. I was never bored.Before I sign off I can't resist pointing out a curiosity about the shoes our heroine was wearing when she first makes her appearance (which was grand indeed). They kept alternating between heels and flats (I noticed 'cause I was giving her a good ogling). All I know is that pumps are a hindrance if you have some athletic ass-kicking to do since you need speed, balance, and coordination. It's as if the director couldn't decide whether or not our heroine should be sexy or practical. Practical means you have a brain in your head, so it's sexy. ---Or would you rather have a zombie?

Iron Man 2," Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Iron Man! No, it's Tony Stark!
","The plot: There are 2 story threads here that merge. 1. The government and military are putting pressure on Tony Stark to turn over the Iron Man Technology to them. 2. Some Russian guy blames Tony's dad for the persecution and death of his own father and seeks revenge. How he goes about it ties into the government's claims that the Iron man technology is better served by giving it to them. Analysis: Enjoyable action-filled movie; well acted and written. Worth your time. If you're not a comic book buff or nut you don't need to read further. You have all you need.Some entertainers (actors, musicians, athletes, IMDb reviewers,etc.) use a 'stage' name and the public is generally unaware of their real name or private identity. But if some find out what their real name is (as sometimes happens) it might not matter because they're more familiar with the stage name and persona and prefer it. In this instance the private identity is eclipsed or overshadowed by the familiar and public persona. However, because Tony Stark is well known in his own right as a famous inventor and head of a well known company (Stark Industries, Inc.) this would not happen. Not to mention the fact that he enjoys attention; seems to need it; thrives on it; is a bit of a ham.So I gotta ask: when people see Iron Man flying across the sky, do they say, 'There goes Iron Man', --or do they say, 'There goes Tony Stark'? There are practical reasons why super heroes (and people involved in important and dangerous operations) need a secret identity; need to maintain a separation; and I'm sure you can guess them. So while I enjoyed the movie, and while I know it's just fantasy, I cannot help but wonder at the unnecessary and foolish recklessness and vanity of Tony Stark that makes him put so much at risk in order to share the limelight with his alter ego Iron Man. And this is beside the point: What is it about good-looking women in form-fitting outfits that beat people up that turns me on? Love, Boloxxxi.",8,2,2,14 September 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," Alice in Zombieland 3: Uncharacteristically average.
","This third outing was disappointing because after two successful outings (above average releases) Resident Evil had become for me a sort of 'brand name' you could trust. My problem with this third installment is that no real care was given to quality of story, characters, and special effects. I wish, for instance, that it had a more suspense and some more surprises; more interesting supporting characters (none of them had any personality folks); and was more visually imaginative.Basically our heroine is now aimlessly wandering the dusty plains on a dusty motorcycle in a dusty coat (reminding me of some heroic western tough guy if you substitute the motorcycle for a horse). The story begins with her waking up naked reminiscent of the previous Resident Evil but she's covered by a white sheet and we don't get to see anything (Damn it to hell!!). Somehow managing to score some rugged, bad-ass girl duds, a motorcycle, and various weaponry, she eventually hooks up with a bus load and truck load of survivors (unzombified) who are looking for other survivors and the promised land, or something. In the mean time some mad scientist who has been trying to find a way to control the zombies discovers that our heroine, the original Alice, is still out there somewhere with the precious T-virus antidote in her blood. So he sets out to snare her so he can bring her back to his lab and have his way with her (Can you blame him?).Finally: This -in my opinion- is an 'average' flick unlike it's 2 predecessors. I recommend it if you have nothing better to do right now and in need of some mild (standard) zombie entertainment. Before I went to see this movie, I didn't read or listen to any reviews; I just grabbed my wallet and crammed as many nieces and nephews in my car as I could and sped off like a jack rabbit on crack (I do so love kick-ass women, folks). Well I won't be doing that again. I must have blown 80 bucks on that mad, impetuous day (I'm like a 5 yr old when I get excited). -Don't get me wrong, I'm not sorry I saw it. I'm just sorry I rushed when I could have leisurely waited for an invite from someone who was going (and paying) or who rented it or bought the DVD later on. Listen, you might think better of this 3rd Resident Evil than I do. I saw, for instance, that another IMDb reviewer gave it a whopping '9 stars'. What the F**K!!! -My eyes almost flew out of my head. But he or she saw what they saw and I have to respect that. I'm just one opinion in a sea of them. Love, Boloxxxi.",6,0,1,17 October 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy says 'hell, no' to golden army.
","Ancient misguided prince (with some nice skills) wants to resurrect a golden army. You can guess what he wants it for. So it's up to Hellboy to see that another power mad nut doesn't get his way.I found this second Hellboy to be too long and too tedious. The first one, as is usual, was far superior. This one had nice sets, effects, and all--BUT-- the story was badly told. The dialog got on my nerves. I dunno. I'm thinking: superheroes (and heroes in general) SHOULD NEVER BE IN A RELATIONSHIP ---at least in movies because it leads to the most boring dialog and crap you don't care about. And while we're at it, No sidekicks, either. Because they're always trying to be funny when they're not. If superheroes were made strictly for a male audience there would be no such thing cause guys just care about going after the bad guy, great effects, and ass-kicking. But these days they're made to have female appeal and so our hero is bogged down by all these emotions and domestic-like banter. Don't get me wrong, it they could make it work --if the dialog was snappy and clever --I wouldn't mind. In this movie Hellboy looks like a big dope and his girlfriend looks like a dope maker. I can't help but think that if she wasn't in the picture (as a love interest) he'd be more focused on what's important to me as a guy: looking cool and kicking ass.

Crash," Divergent lives intersect dramatically
","I'm usually a little tight with my stars but I must roll them out for this one. WHAT CLEVER WRITING!!! I give this gem 9 stars. If anyone wants to give it 10 I won't argue.As you know, there is always human drama in movies, more or less. In some movies the human drama is central and in others it's incidental. I generally prefer the latter (I'm sooo, sooo shallow, I know). The reason I mention this is because Crash is a human-drama type or focused movie. And I LOVED it (there's hope for me yet, and possible you, if you're like me).Imagine your life as a thread which may or may not have significant drama. Now imagine this thread that is your life coming in contact with other threads, other people's lives. In doing so, it can either add drama and/or receive drama or have no noticeable effect. The movie Crash is about several people, from diverse walks of life, who at some point intersect (and sometimes re-intersect) to add or receive drama. The result is that a bigger drama involving these people is created in the form of an intriguing web of lives.Finally, before I sign off, let me say that I have a few choice words for any other commentator on IMDb who saw this movie and did not roll out the stars. On second thought, I think I would prefer not to give or receive any drama. Love, Boloxxxi.",9,0,5,17 April 2007
The Expendables," You disrespecting me, man? As soon as I get my camera man and editor I'm gonna kick your ass.
","A group of mercenaries called 'The Expendables' are hired by the CIA to take out a Latin dictator who's making his people's life hell. The mercenaries later figure out that the real target is a former CIA operative who is using bribery and intimidation (acting like a 'dictator behind the dictator') to conduct illegal activities in the country.My problem with this movie and many action movies in general are 'quick-cuts' (and 'late-cuts'). Say what??? Okay. Editing. Since it is used to 'cut from' and to 'cut to' a scene, it's principal function and responsibility is CONTINUITY. Therefore if the cut is too soon or too late it disturbs continuity.Editing, or 'cutting away from' and 'cutting away to' a scene can occur anywhere in a movie, but it is used in greater frequency in fight scenes and action scenes in general because a lot is happening in the moment. But is also used artistically or creatively to make an action scene look cool and/or to make you believe that something happened that might actually not have or could not have.The fight scenes are what concern me. I'm a purist. I feel that too often they are aided by quick-cuts (the scene was not allowed to follow through). Basically, the editor helps the performer (even the ones in this movie that are supposed to know how to fight) with editing and camera work. The effect of which is a kind of 'slight of hand' martial arts or fight scene.In my opinion, the only way you can tell if someone really knows what they are doing is to use as few 'cut aways' (and 'cut tos') as possible during the action. This way you get a good look at their technique and have a sense of REAL continuity. This kind of 'quick cut' and 'splice' type of fighting in movies has sadly become the trend.'What's your style?' 'Crane-style' kung-fu. What's yours?''Camera-editing' style.' 'Never heard of it.' 'Well, whenever I get into a fight, I make sure my camera is set up and running. Then after the fight is over I run home and do some editing so that I come out on top. Sneaky style, ain't it?' 'Yeah. It is.' Love, Boloxxxi.",5,2,6,13 November 2010
The Village," A bunch of people hide out in the woods somewhere.
","I wonder if there isn't a lot of in-breeding going on in this village? Well when a bunch of people decide to cut themselves off from the rest of the world to form their own little community.....well, you do the math.At the risk of appearing to contradict myself, The Village is both boring and interesting at the same time. By this I mean it's boring in it's delivery but has an interesting overall idea. I would describe it as a slow-paced (talkative), mystery-thriller. There was 1 or 2 tense moments during the course of the film but it really doesn't get moving until the very end. This means there is ample time for you to take a few naps or go to the bathroom and stare at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself the meaning of life.So in closing, If you don't mind talk padding your mystery-thriller, then by all means check The Village out. For the rest of you, seeing this movie will probably leave you with 'mixed feelings'; an interesting idea but could have been delivered better, i.e., less talk and more creepy sh*t happening. Love, Boloxxxi.",6,0,0,7 June 2007
Wanted," Nervous wreck gets recruited by elite assassins.
","Here's what you need to know real fast.Wanted is a movie 'somewhat' reminiscent of the Matrix and Die Hard movies as far as the action goes. It concerns a secret group of elite assassins and a new recruit that get their marching orders from a 'loom' (Say what?!!). Yeah, you heard me right. So we're clear: the weaving machine --not the 'loon' which is a diving bird. However, since the loom operates like a crazy raffle wherein even the assassins themselves can be targeted you are within your rights if you want to confuse loom with loon. My recommendation is that you not think too hard and just enjoy the ride because the movie is entertaining. At this point, if you have better things to do --go do them. You have the essentials. If not, pray continue to read the rest of my crap --er--my views.Now, continuing with the loon --I mean 'loom' business: The assassins apparently don't know anything about their targets beyond a name, a face, and a location. So they have to take it on faith that they deserve to die; that the world would be a better place without them. As well, they must view the kill as an act of 'fate'. Hmmmm! Another of my issues was that the powers of the assassins is not, in my view, adequately explained beyond saying that it is the result of some kind of adrenalin rush that they can consciously control. I didn't completely buy that. But that's me.When the assassins get injured they take some sort of healing bath that makes them recover very quickly. My question is: why not share this with medical science which would do a lot more good than randomly offing people you don't know anything about? This brings us to the important question of whether the assassins purpose is indeed to do good --or are they 'blind assassins' to which good and bad as we ordinarily think of it is irrelevant? Finally, there is some humor in this movie and in my opinion the best laughs comes from Morgan Freeman who throughout most of the movie had a dignified, urbane, and erudite bearing. ---But then he goes 'street' on everybody's ass. I don't want to say anymore. See for yourself. One last thing: watch for the clever path of that bullet as it basically says 'f**k you!' to four people all at once. My goodness, two birds with one stone is nothing compared to this! Love, Boloxxxi.",7,0,2,12 August 2008
Disturbia," Kid suspects a neighbor is a serial killer.
","How to watch this movie? Step1: Get someone to pay your way. Step2: After the first 10 minutes take a nap for 60. Step3: Continue watching the movie.Friends, I don't want to disturb ya, but you know how movies generally start out innocuously until about 15 to 20 minutes into it (more or less) then something happens and the ball starts to roll, so to speak? Well this movie got the ball rolling early within 10 minutes or so then dropped it for about 60 wherein NOTHING WAS HAPPENING except some childish voyeurism, pranks, and teenage crush.I had no idea this movie was going to be a take on a famous Alfred Hitchcock movie wherein an incapacitated individual, due to boredom, spends much of his time looking out his window with a binoculars; watching the world go by -without him. In this movie a teenager gets confined to house arrest and has to wear an ankle monitor for decking his Spanish teacher. He's young, has a lot of energy, and wants to do stuff but his limited to the proximity of his house. So when not playing video games and talking to his smart/idiot friend (I'm not sure which) on his cell phone, he's looking through his binoculars and sizing up his neighborhood as if for the first time. Shortly, a new girl moves in next door and she becomes the chief object of his voyeurism for a while until they become friends and there is silly jealousy and infatuation on his part. Friends, I have basically outlined an hour of this movie.This movie almost seemed like 3 movies. The first part: promising, the second part: aimless and boring, and the third part: tense and suspenseful.So the problem I had with this movie is that there was nothing suspenseful or interesting going on for a large chunk of it. I'm giving this movie 4 stars for wasting about 60 minutes of my time. Interestingly, I see that many other IMDb commentators have an opposite view and have generously rolled out the stars. Obviously we see the world with different eyes. I can only comment on WHAT I SAW or DID NOT SEE, as the case may be. Love, Boloxxxi.",4,0,3,29 April 2007
The Mist," Misty for a better ending.
","The Mist is about a bunch of people trapped inside a store because of a suspicion that something outside, in the form of a mysterious mist or fog, might be killing people. Well I like the weird and so I thought the idea was interesting. Didn't like the ending though. And I like kids BUT they can be very annoying and/or distracting in some movies. One of the most annoying child in a movie of recent times (I think) is the little girl in War of the Worlds with Tom Cruze with her constant chattering, nagging, bitching, and need for reassurance. Not only did Cruze have to contend with aliens, he also had his hands filled with this obnoxious brat AND her brother.Ahhh, good to get that off my chest.Now where was I? Most of the time kids do well in films but there's the occasional one where you wish they weren't there. In the mist the main character has a son whose absence, I thought, would have served this movie better. Why? Because he had to spend too much time reassuring him and being a 'daddy' -I guess- when I wanted the story to move along and deal with what mattered: the mysterious mist and how the 'grown-ups' were handling the situation. The kid was an unnecessary distraction that the movie could have done without. Another thing that annoyed me was that nutty religious woman. Made me wish I was there with a two by four (oh yeah, I'd put an early end to that nonsense).The mist was yet another good idea that could have used better execution. Still, it was interesting enough with good effects to warrant 6 stars from me. Without the kid and that nutty woman I would have given it one more. And without that unsatisfactory ending I would have given it yet another. All said and done, quite probable that you'll enjoy this more than I unless you share my aversion for distracting daddy time and ranting religious nuts. Love, Boloxxxi.",6,1,3,18 May 2008
I Am Legend," One day some scientist is going to screw us.
","Another LAST MAN ON EARTH-VERSUS MUTANTS-AND LOOKING FOR OTHER SURVIVORS movie. I'm not sure how the title of it relates to this idea but I guess when you're all alone in the world you can be whatever you want. I dunno. In this movie Smith proves yet again that if you keep getting choice roles no one will notice or care that your acting abilities are only 'passable'. Some actors carry their parts others are carried by their parts. That said, you don't have to be a great actor to make entertaining movies and this movie had it's moments. Alas! Not as many as I would have liked but still a 'slightly above average' effort. I didn't like the man-dog relationship in this particular movie. I'm not a big fan of dogs, anyway. Still, when the movie started, I thought man and dog made a nice entrance together in that sports car and the relationship looked promising. However, after that, not so cool anymore. That's just me, folks. Bottom line is that the movie is worth a look. I give this movie 5 stars and 1 woof! Love, Boloxxxi.",6,1,2,9 April 2008
Shrek the Third," Fairy tale baddies seek revenge and Shrek goes on a quest to avoid the throne.
","THE FROG KING RULES!!! -Well anyway, that was the funniest scene in the whole movie and it came early so after that hilarious and promising bit Shrek 3 was only mildly amusing. I felt there were some missed opportunities in making some scenes funnier by what was shown and/or said. As I watched, I found myself saying, 'They should have done this instead of that' or 'said this instead of that'.Shrek 3 is 'average' and so I'm giving it 5 stars + 1 for the frog king = 6. It is best for children, I think; If I were a kid I'd give it 9 or 10 stars for cuteness and animation alone. But a grown person needs a little bit more edge, imagination, and cleverness than is offered; a bit more 'meat and potatoes', if you will. There are, for example, many hard-headed prisoners who I'm sure would agree that it's not as simple as is portrayed towards the end of the movie. Couldn't they have come up with something 'less straight forward?' Like maybe a 'key', for instance (chuckle! chuckle!) So my final 2 cents is this: Highly recommended for kids (under 12, I'm thinking). Mildly amusing for Adults (except for the frog king scene, of course; that was a scream).

Ex Machina," Tech wiz knight meets his AI princess locked away in a secure remote facility.
","The very wealthy creator and proprietor of an internet search-engine innovates an artificial intelligence in the form of a human female and enlists the aid of a young male employee to test it at his remote hi-tech home/research facility thru conversations and interactions to see if it possesses 'real' consciousness.There is little to no action in Ex Machina in terms of fighting, running around, and explosions. This easily goes unnoticed and unmissed by us however, since the general topic of human beings meeting and interacting with something 'other' is so entertainingly well done. Almost from the very start of this movie we find ourselves helplessly immersed in the conversations and interactions of 3 persons and 1 'questionable person' within the intimate (focused) setting of a visually captivating hi-tech home/research facility.Let me introduce you: Nathan (AI innovator): Direct, outwardly friendly, energetic. A giant ego is evident. As well, one can sense an underlying restlessness and temperament; a dark side. What is he up to? What are his unspoken ambitions? You cannot help but wonder.Kyoko (Servant, lover, plaything and who knows what else): She does not speak but she dances. And there is a hilarious and incongruous scene (which made it even more effective) having to do with this. Priceless! And the look on Caleb's face... Well if ever there was a WTF look, that was it. Kyoko is however withdrawn; seems always cowed and unhappy. Does this have anything to do with the suspected and unknown dark side of Nathan? Hmmm.Caleb (Nathan's employee and elected tester of his AI): Has an unusual grasp and insight of AI technology and theory. And so seems very smart, even gifted, where this is concerned. Other than that, he seems a basically decent, ordinary guy-nextdoor-type which is why he is our 'point man', so to speak, in the movie. This means that we, the viewing audience, can identify with him more than the other principals.Ava (AI): You would never know she was a machine if it were not visually obvious in her physical construction. I felt an eerie fascination for her combined human and machine qualities. I believe you will too, Reader. She's at first guarded but polite with our point man. And later, determined, and distressed about some hidden desire and knowledge she possesses.Enough said! I would not presume to give you orders Reader, but if there is more to you than car crashes and explosions and you love your sci-fi as much as I do, then you need to get your butt in gear and see this movie. Highly recommended. Love, Boloxxxi.",8,1,8,17 May 2015
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The F4 deal with personal issues and a cool looking surfer bringing death and destruction.
","I have a confession: I have NEVER liked Hollywood's rendition of my childhood comic heroes.One reason is that I don't believe the actors they chose were right for the roles. The second reason is that they always insert some love interest or angle that slows the story down and that I don't care about. I suspect they do this to have a broader appeal to female audiences. As far as I'm concerned, a superhero -male or female- functions a lot better without attachments and personal relationships. This brings us to one of the reasons I found the latest Spiderman and now the Fantastic 4 annoying. It's like to me, these guys are forced to play house and deal with silly jealousies and domestic issues when more pressing things in the form of the fate of the world is at stake. Frankly, all this nonsense seriously cut into my 'kickass-time'.Okay. I'm glad I got that off my chest. Now to the Fantastic 4 commentary: This movie is not spectacular. However,in my opinion, it is a decent 'TV-level' movie not suited for theatrical release. 2 reasons: tickets are expensive and audiences want to be blown away; this is especially true when they go to see a FX or 'special effects' movie. They want to see something awesome, jaw-dropping, and in-your-face on the big screen. Not some guy surfing around 2 people and their wedding plans. Love, Boloxxxi.",6,1,3,4 July 2007
Transformers," Machines try to stop another from getting a cube -else the earth is screwed.
","When a movie is not as good as it could have been it's usually not the fault of the FX people. They deliver 99% of the time (when it's not low-budget). And it's usually not the fault of a seasoned actor if a movie is lucky enough to snag one. This movie snagged Jon Voight who played his role as a general or secretary of state (I forget which) straight as an arrow. Good for him. I only wish everyone else had done the same thing.Let me explain: I guess you could call this movie a 'sci-fi semi-comedy' whose humor was largely supposed to be in the dialogue and the antics of an uncute mini-transformer . Trouble is, though trying hard to be, the dialogue wasn't funny and got on my nerves big time. Honestly, I had a border-line migraine from the unfunny chatter. There were at least 3 occasions (maybe more) where I can remember thinking 'Shut the f**k up, already!' The principal offender was the 'Disturbia' guy who seems to be type-cast 'cause he was doing his nervous, babbling, blundering when-I-see-a-girl-I-like and when-there's-a-crisis shtick. Somehow the pretty girl in the movie is always attracted to him and I seriously wonder why. Maybe they feel his constant nervous blathering is disarming and even cute; perhaps even flattering. They probably also figure that any man who is this tongue-tied and bumbling over a woman would make a nice pet.To help young Disturbia out with the unfunny chatter was a brief appearance (mercifully) by Bernie Mac who plays a fast-talking car salesman (Was this one of those times when I said 'Shut the f**k up?'). Now I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like the more success some comedians achieve the less funny they become; just not as sharp as the good old days when they had their 'A-game' going on. Also on hand to help Disturbia (I don't know the guy's name folks) tank this movie was Anthony Anderson with more unfunny yak yak. (No memory loss here; I did say 'Shut the f**k up, already!' to this guy on his intro.) Finally, parents take note: kids, because they tend to be less critical, would enjoy this movie more because of the cool machines and special effects. I myself would also have enjoyed this movie more if the rest of the cast played their roles as dignified and straight as Jon Voight. There was just too much unfunny motor mouthing going on for me. And the end of the movie reminded me of why I generally don't like war movies: too noisy and confusing. You know- Who's doing what to who, and why? Etc, etc, etc. KA-BOOM! CRASH! BANG! Aspirins, anyone? Love, Boloxxxi.",5,1,5,30 September 2007
The Dark Knight," Best Joker ever vs. Best Batman ever.
","The Joker tries out his 'chaos theory' on Gotham. To get things rolling, he targets crime bosses, public and government officials, and later -the general public.Comic book characters are no longer just for kids. At least not the ones in movies. They represent huge financial, intellectual, and artistic investments; with awesome revenues if they succeed. And we all know that this one did big time. I was impressed by how well conceived and developed Batman and his environment was. The idea that one gets is that he's a hero on the cutting-edge of technology. And in this respect is ahead of his time. Indeed, this is what affords him the ability to be a super hero. Just like Iron Man, for example.In his early days, Batman was more of a great athlete and detective with only a couple of gizmos. It was enough at the time. But now he's very hi-tech: from the suit that he wears, to his means of travel. Nothing drives this point home more than his 'bat cave' which is not a primitive cave anymore but is now an enormous, futuristically sterile-looking, light-ambient room serving as his base of operations.Now I'd like to comment on the early rumblings about Batman's voice. When you think about it (and for some reason, many of us never did before), he would need to change his voice to protect his identity. Moreover, he would need a voice that was intimidating to criminals. So the voice change had this logical dual purpose. It was as intelligently conceived as the Joker's crude face paint.Lets talk about the Joker.This comic book villain has come a long way. From a well made up, scheming, over-the-top, clownish dandy, to his latest movie incarnation as a pathetic, cunning, malevolent, and sad human wreck. One who isn't interested in loot, but to live and prove his 'chaos theory' (no reason for anything; it's all random and impersonal) -and no doubt, to share his misery with the world.The carelessly (and perhaps 'angrily') smeared paint on his face was brilliant because it was an effective way to make us take the Joker's 'happy face' seriously. Just looking at him you knew there was something really bent-out-of-shape inside; something really f**ked up happened to him and he keeps telling a different story each time. So you feel sorry for him, but also fear him; just as you would a badly mistreated animal you know you can't -and shouldn't- pet. Not if you want to keep your arm, anyway.You know, when I heard some buzz that they were thinking of giving the actor who played the Joker a posthumous award. I was thinking that it was probably a 'sympathy' award; that his performance probably wasn't anything special. This was of course before I saw the Dark Knight. Now I see that his performance was nothing short of brilliant. In my mind, absolutely no one could have done better. So now I'm wondering who will play the Joker in the future. Comparisons are going to be made. Any new Joker will -I think- have big clown shoes to fill. Love, Boloxxxi.",9,2,6,17 September 2008
War of the Worlds," Alien Invasion
","I would have enjoyed this movie (I love science fiction) but for one reason: there's a kid in it that kept tweaking my nerves from the beginning of the movie to the end. Those who have seen this film know what I'm talking about. For those who have not seen it don't bother unless you know you will have high tolerance for a kid with a high-pitched squeal that stabs at your nerve endings through out the film, who keeps asking 10 questions per second, and who seems to have a talent for doing the opposite of what she should do.I felt sorry for Tom Cruise's character because he not only had to deal with the alien invasion but his baggage of spoiled neurotic kids as well. Don't get me wrong folks, I love children, but this one caught me off guard. Funny thing is that I have seen this kid in 2 other films and found her adorable. But in this one.....sheeesh!! She should have gotten an Oscar for ANNOYING. I give this film 5 stars out of ten, but would have given it 7 or 8 just for imagination and special effects alone ---BUT FOR THAT KID!!!! If you decide you want to see the movie have aspirins handy! Love, Boloxxxi.",5,0,1,3 April 2007
Shooter," Sniper is framed by unscrupulous government officials.
","In this movie shooting a bullet is like a launch from NASA. Well, maybe I exaggerate, -BUT it can be more technical and involved than many realize. What's the movie about? Retired ace with a gun gets conned into government service one more time when Danny Glover's character waves the American flag at him and plays the guilt card. The assignment? Figure out the vulnerabilities -from a shooter's perspective- of an upcoming public presidential engagement so that he (the president) can be better protected. Yeah.Well, what's a shooter to do? Accept the assignment, of course, so the fun can begin! If you like manhunt or fugitive-type movies then you more than likely will like this one. I did. 7 stars worth. This makes it a SHOULD-SEE movie and 1 star shy of being a MUST-SEE movie which in my opinion is 8-10 stars.In balance, the plot did seem a little murky to me on one or more occasion but that could just be me being dumb or not paying close enough attention. NEVER MIND THAT. The 'basic idea' is clear and you can run pretty good with that. Love, Boloxxxi.",7,0,2,10 April 2007
The Conjuring," Recipe for a Haunted House Horror Movie
","Ahh, let me see now.... Where'd I put my recipe book? Gimme a sec, Reader. Oh yeah! Here it is! Okay. You'll need 1 house. To this house add 1 to 3 table spoonful of f!!cked-up history.Next, you'll need to add new residents. 1 will do, but I prefer to add a whole family. Included in this family is the obligatory resentful teen who objects to the move. As well, there is the cute kid who shortly begins communications with a 'new friend' once the family moves in. And don't forget the family dog that senses that 'something ain't quite right'. Woof! This is important reader: Add a pinch of joy and optimism. After all, it's a new home and new beginning.Now add a 1/2 teaspoonful of curious sh!t that may have a plausible explanation. An unpleasant odor, cold, for example.This should be eventually followed by 2 table spoonfuls of full-out weird sh!t that cannot be naturally explained away. Seeing things and physical assault, for example.Immediately add 1 and 1/4 table spoonfuls of panic, fear, and unhappiness, since it now looks like this promising new home and beginning has been shot to hell.Now generously add 1 and 1/2 cup of desperation.Quickly add 2 religious experts in the supernatural.Again add a pinch of joy and optimism (The experts have arrived and the family is comforted).Now add 10 pounds of terror, supernatural phenomenon, destructiveness, assault, and all-out mayhem.That's it reader. That's the recipe for a haunted house horror movie. You may optionally (It's your call) liberally sprinkle relief, a pound of joy, and a pinch of optimism at the end. My own preference is to leave that out. Highly recommended. Love, Boloxxxi.",8,0,1,21 October 2013
Iron Man," Get the lead out and go see Iron Man.
","Finally a comic book super hero not mucked up by Hollywood through miscasting and/or unfaithful adaption. I only saw the first Spiderman and didn't bother with the others (No way can I see that guy as Peter Parker). The first guy to play Batman was, I believe, also miscast in the role. Still, with all the cool gadgetry, atmosphere, and big screen treatment we had never seen before at the time, --he got away with it; and was probably the best of the bunch until 'Batman Begins' which was a very good effort. Hands down the 'Return of Superman' was the best. Anyway you want to know about Iron Man. Damn good! And I give it 8 stars. I had no complaints about the guy who played the role of Tony Stark and Iron Man and the screen adaption was faithful enough.Synopsis: Tony Stark is a brilliant self-indulgent playboy with a ready wit and totally clueless of the real world as far as war, politics, and business are concerned. A world he blindly contributes to through the sale of revolutionary weaponry ideas to our military and government. During a fateful trip he is ambushed and kidnapped by eastern radicals who want him to build a weapon system for them. It is then that his eyes begin to open and he starts to question his own values and role in the conflicts around the world through his creation and contribution of weapons. It is at this time that Iron Man is conceived. Crude at first, but later very polished, very cool. Great costume and effects! In short, folks, Iron Man's a winner. And if you haven't already, grab the little ones and run out and see it. Love, Boloxxxi.",8,1,2,2 June 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Computer lunatic and his crack team of muscle and egg-heads cause pandemonium.
","Action-packed as usual, but oddly unsatisfying.My problem: The sh*t hits the fan too quickly and we are not properly re-introduced to McClane. Here's an old friend we haven't seen in a long time and we don't get a chance to say hello, so to speak, and see how his life has been and what he's been up to lately. Where does he live? How does he live? Who are his friends? -You know, stuff like that. A major blunder in the making of this movie, I think. A proper re-introduction would have re-connected us to the guy; made us sympathize with him and care about him more.Another reason I couldn't re-connect was that McClane seems to have lost his innocence: Ordinary 'Joe Shmoe' (a cop) with no special training or affiliation who accidentally finds himself in the midst of something a lot bigger than himself that he's forced to deal with. He's one of us. And like we would be, he's scared to death but deals with it by being a wise-ass. Mclaine in this movie seems more like a 'veteran' and though he confides that he's afraid I didn't believe it. In fact, the evil mastermind seemed more scared of him.So I didn't care about McClane as much as I should have. The real star of the movie as far as I'm concerned were the terrific stunts and explosions. All of that was good eye-candy. Speaking of eye-candy, another thing that would have made this movie better for me was if the good looking kick-ass Asian chick in her snug black outfit had been given a larger role. In fact drop the guy who plays the evil computer mastermind and make her the mastermind. The free-runner guy -or 'monkey man'- could be her number 2. He was pretty good.I give this movie 7 stars for the action and stunts. Could have gotten 2 more with better story telling. Finally -this is a side issue, I know- I have to ask the question: Do macho guys have 'sons' anymore? A trend started in Hollywood possibly with 1985's Commando wherein the macho hero always has a daughter. In fact, now that I think about it, it is usually a daughter in the movies these days and not a son. One reason, I suspect, is that it knocks some of the hard edges off our macho hero. Modern women instead of feeling threatened can say 'Look, he has a daughter who he adores and is protective of. This must mean he's sensitive and likes women.' The other reason I guess is the woman (or girl)-in-peril thing which is more interesting to us than man (or boy)-in-peril. In fact I have come up with what I call our 'society's sympathetic order'. First children, then the elderly, then women, then animals, and then men. How did I come up with this? I imagined a sinking ship. Love, Boloxxxi.",7,0,1,10 July 2007
300," This movie is about a number of super-trained spartans (guess how many) who must ward off an invasion intent on domination and slavery.
","This movie has an interesting look and feel about it (I recommend that you see it on the biggest screen you can find; this is not TV-sized fare). At one or 2 points in the movie the lead character reminded me of Sylvester Stallone when he shouted Something (no, not 'Yo, Adrian!'). In fact, this would have been a good vehicle for Stallone when he was in his prime.I give this movie '7' stars which makes it only one star shy of a MUST SEE movie which in my opinion is 8-9-or 10. It's however a SHOULD SEE movie (6-7). I thought it was imaginative and entertaining with good action and spectacle. So if you wanna see an imaginative-fantasy-warrior-type movie then you SHOULD like this one.",7,3,8,25 March 2007
Her," After his failed marriage a man decides to get it on with a computer's operating system.
","From the look of his expensive digs it's hard to believe this guy makes that much coin writing sentimental letters for other people who don't have the words, time, or interest to do it themselves (It occurs to me that a con artist, well versed in bullsh!t, could do the same thing without a college degree). He's not strapped for cash then, this guy. Nonetheless he enters into a 'low maintenance relationship'. No trips, gifts, clothes, and food to buy for another person. Not to mention any extra for rent and utilities. The guy must be on the cheap in other ways then. Non-material. Skimping on say, the time, energy, emotional-commitment, consideration, and understanding that a real woman would require of him.I was hoping for a weird, creepy, sci-fi movie. 'Man in a relationship with an OS', you could go somewhere creepy with that. Alas! That did not happen! Curses! The OS sounded and acted like a regular woman from the get-go. Even as a disembodied voice it was hard not to think of it as a REAL woman; perhaps one in the dark, at some distance, or on the phone. I would have preferred that the OS didn't sound and act so human -at least not at first. Perhaps it could have evolved in time. By doing it the way they did we lost the 'creepy-factor' of a man in a relationship with something that was 'other'. NOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING. Instead, what we got was a man in a 'normal-appearing' relationship.The dialog between man and OS is neither witty or interesting; it's so ordinary it's boring. Reader, you could hear the same thing if you eavesdropped on two people in a budding relationship. AND FOR FREE! In fact the movie was one long chatfest. When the guy is not talking to the computer about his, it's, and their problems (or whispering sweet nothings in it's imaginary or virtual ear), he's talking to his friend about his problems and hers. After 30 minutes of this you might find your eyes wandering to your lap, your fingernails, to anyone in your proximity to see how they're faring, and finally to any available exit.No one even bats an eye when the guy tells people he's in a relationship with an OS. It would have been a more interesting movie if he was trying to hide it (a horrible secret, the fear of scorn and ridicule, ostracization...etc). We, the viewing audience, would have been like eager voyeurs to the weird sh!t that was going down. F!!cking guy is doing an OS on the sly. Yeahhh! I didn't even like the characters in the movie. When viewing a movie we want the lead character to basically be 'someone we are connective with' for whatever reason. I felt no sympatico for the guy, nor -for that matter- any of the men in this movie who all seemed, well... 'ineffectual'. And for some reason, they all dressed the same; pants high up over their belly buttons and shapeless, box-like, loafers on their feet like my grandfather. On a younger man I'm not sure what the hell to make of it. It's the opposite extreme of rapper fashion where everyone can see your drawers. Imagine those 2 groups together in the same room milling around making whatever statement they're trying to make with the height of their pants (I cannot help but chuckle at the thought).To close, let me say this: Her has a high IMDb rating which I don't necessarily disagree with. If 2 people go into a restaurant and one enjoyed the food and the other didn't, who's wrong? It's a matter of personal taste and expectations. This movie did not meet 'my' taste or expectations.
