Blade Runner 2049," An instant sci-fi classic!
","This should be the standard for all big budget sequels. It impresses on every level - acting, cinematography, etc.I give this an 8 out of 10 because Denis Villeneuve has built upon, perfectly, what Ridley Scott originally had laid out. Ryan Gosling was a great choice to play 'K', he nails all aspects of the character. He is the archetypal hero during the film's action scenes, and he is also believable in the film's serious, more emotion based, scenes. This cinematography and colours of the film is nothing short of a spectacle. It's beautiful, despite some of the locations having a grimy, desolate feel, it looks great. Also, the film's story and writing is good too. They are nods, subtle and explicit, to the film's predecessor. Which, in the cinema, made me smile because I knew the film was in the right hands!Whilst seeing Blade Runner (1982) is an essential watch for any cinephile, it isn't imperative for a casual audience member, watching this film, but it certainly does help when it comes to the viewer's overall impact of the film on them.In the end, this film is great! I will certainly be buying the Blu- ray. A great sequel, that is probably better than it's predecessor. I would recommend deciding for yourself nevertheless.",7,3,8,23 October 2017
