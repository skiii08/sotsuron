First Man," Intense and compelling film
","It's an insight into the inner life of Neil Armstrong, and how he got to to be the first person to put a foot on the moon. It's a story about the man on a very special moment of human history from his point of view. Doing the story of his whole life would mean a detriment of importance on what the historical moment was about and how hard it was to get there. Camera work is superb, the so criticized shaky camera works in this accidental journey to be the first man, depicting the struggles, deaths and personal hurdles... from his point of view, not flashy headlines. Practical visual effects add a layer of realism instead of relying on the digital but vacuum wow factor, topped with the quality of a real film camera shooting so rare nowadays.",10,0,1,25 February 2019
