United 93," A tragic day in American history, recalls unfortunate events.
","People that say the facts are incorrect need to go back and research the immediate phone calls made from the civilians and staff on flight. They have actual recordings of people from United 93, and it's chilling. They are not calm, they are in distress and clearly shaken. This film recalls unfortunate events from a tragic time in American history. I don't view this film as entertaining/means of entertainment. It's important to take this film as an unfortunate means of education. To remember what happened that terrible day in history. All the people that lost their life on that terrible day. This movie is specified to flight 93. They overtook and crashed the plane into a field in a plan to insure nobody else would lose their life that day. They knew whatever they did, they were going to lose their life, so they sacrificed their life. Who knows what would've happened if they didn't act on the decision they made. Thousands of others could have passed away. They made a sacrificial choice, to save others, many others. My thoughts are with anyone and everyone that had to deal with a loss from that day. But please, don't be a negative critic on such a important/realistic part of history. They did everything they could to make this as realistic as possible. As terrifying as it is, it's reality. Don't go into this movie as entertainment. Go into it as reality.",10,2,3,11 September 2018
