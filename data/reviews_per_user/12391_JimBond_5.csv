The Blair Witch Project," Hitchcock would be proud
","This movie isn't a blood and guts Monster with a knife type of scary movie. This is just an old fashoned mess with your mind scare the pants off you movie.  The only reason this movie is R because of the language, but if you were in that situation you'd be useing that language too.If parents are reading this I recommend this movie to ages 13 and up.  There is no gore or blood.  Just language, and anyone under 13 that sees it would sleep in their parents bed for 3 weeks.This is the scariest movie I've ever seen.  Scarier than The Shining in my opinion.  So if you want to be freaked see this now.",10,2,3,3 August 1999
Apocalypse Now," The Best War Movie.........Ever!!!!
","This is a masterpiece film. Awsome cast, Awsome director, Awsome cinematography (some of the best ever). Besides The Godfather I & II, this is Francis Ford Coppela's finest flick. The begining seemed very similar to Saving Private Ryan. Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper are the two best actors in this movie. Although Marlon Brando gives an unusual performace as seeming like a psycho. 'I love the smell of napong in the morning.' said by Robert Duvall and 'Arresting someone for murder in this place, is like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.' said by Martin Sheen are the two best quotes from the movie",10,0,0,15 December 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Movie Ever
","You must see this movie.  Great plot, awesome acting.  I can't believe it didn't win an Oscar.  It should have beaten Gump that year.",10,0,1,29 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Very Hitchcock
","This is an awsome movie.  Very unique and Original.  The director must have studied every single thing that The Master has done, because every single frame looked Hitchcockian.  The scene when they were at the funeral, the shots were exactly like the party scenes in Notorious. To top the whole movie off the very unexpected twist at the end was unbelievable.",10,0,0,24 September 1999
The Matrix," The AWSOMEST movie
","You can't get better than this!  The best Special F/X, nice plot, great acting, the only bad thing about it is that it makes my life look boring.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
