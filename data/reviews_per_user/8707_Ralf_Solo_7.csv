3:10 to Yuma," Silly movie
","The movie starts great but then the story gets more and more total silly situation , who doesn't make any sens at all .************may contain spoilers****************** Where go the bandits after the robbery , where their share the money, how act the prisoner during the trip to the train station and the reaction of the escort guys and so and so....*************************************************The acting and the filming is good , the story is weak , full of silly situation to make the story advance. It should have be much better , but maybe the main idea was not so good after all for a descent western movie. The ending is a total non sense in my taste.",4,1,5,23 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," Silly and almost bad
","I understand now how filmmakers write their script, first they think to some 'cool scene' , it is that they write first, then they build a story to link theses 'cool scene' at the result than stupid people do stupid things making silly events to advance a pointless story.The movie however starts good , with some trill and action, but here again we have the 'stupid shacked hand-held camera motion' who make the action confuse and add NOTHING to the movie, no extra tension, no extra drama, no fancy effect ... ho yeah it give sea-sickness.The story who follow is 2 kids who mess around and don't fell sorry of it and situations that defy the base of the human logic and intellect. 28 Weeks Later without theses completely silly events and the stupid shacked camera could have be a much better movie.I'm glad some other people feel the same way and do not over-rate this movie, I give a 4 starts to punish for taking me for a dumb and for messing around with the camera.",4,4,8,6 June 2007
Kick-Ass," First pedo action movie ?
","This movie is just plain horrible, there are not hero there but just sadistic psychopath in costume murdering people. I'n not an angel, I saw a lot of hard core movies but I guess it is the first time than a kid is exploited like this in an 'action flick' ... This thing is outrageous as a child porn movie !!! It is not strange as our society is ruled by a ruthless elite class and they show themselves more and more in public view. This movie is testing public reaction, and I hope people will get angry as I was watching this snuff film. Last thing , these M*F* have use one of the best score of an western movie during a scene a child is murdering in cold blood several people like it was a joke, or cool, it is atrocious ...",1,4,13,20 August 2010
Grindhouse," Painful for the eyes to watch
","When the movie starts we have a pretty funny trailer of a fake movie with the picture quality quite bad,jumping, scratched with some failure with the sound track in fact a 'fake bad quality picture' trailer of a fake movie... I thought it was quite cool but then the real movie starts, the 'fake bad quality picture' continue ... killing my eyes for 90 minutes ... I didn't understand why ?Was it an homage to what the people living in a small village in India or a ghost town in the middle of the desert in south America experimented in their movie theater ? Yeah but there are hundred of millions of people who never experimented that so ...no nostalgia about it for them.Was it some kind of joke , well it was funny for 5 minutes but like we say the better jokes are the shorter ones ?The first part movie was nice even so ,R.Rodrigez made a good action and zombies story like it always should be with Tom Savini so funny as always , Michael Biehn from 'Aliens' ...well a bunch of nice actors. It was not a serious story, so the movie went well.Hopfully it will be a 'restored' version DVD :) because to difficult to watch it again.The second part movie was made by Q.Tarentino , a OK/good story with the excellent Kurt Russell, watchable until the 15 last minutes ...Come on Tarentino we all know your kind of women fantasy , but do you have to make all the women who stand the bad guy as a 'kill bill' copycat , half masculine , half b*itch ...you know for a loooot of men it is not really their taste. Do you make movies or home made videos for personal use ?Interressing movie , funny fake movie trailers , but I give a 6 for over-exploiting a good idea, destroying my beautiful eyes and insulting the real women.",6,2,5,30 April 2007
War of the Worlds," Again a great story spoiled by Steven Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg loves to make drama and always makes movies about family relationship , a son with his mother , a daughter with her father , childes with adults , you name it , but as a 'good' businessman he is afraid to make a pure drama without any computer special effects , to not lose any dollars he adds specials features to his soap operas like robots (AI), dinosaurs (Jurrasic Park 1,2,3), Meteors (deep impact, the worse movie I ever saw in theater after Jaws 4) and now aliens in this movie , War of the Worlds, he uses also the service of a good famous actor ,here Tom Cruise ...et voilà.Sadly the trick is working , and people keep coming to watch the Steven Spielberg true dramas fake SF movies .If you take a SF movie like Aliens or Predator , The central point is the monster and the relationships of the heroes just turn around this central point , theses relations are not too deep but enough to know what everyone is thinking and feeling , the best part is for the plot,the suspense ,the action and the thrill. In this movie the aliens are in the second plan ,in the background ,who are they , what they are doing , if you didn't read the book or seen the first movie , you just don't know , Steven Spilberg confessed it, he wanted to concentrate the story to a relation between a father and his daughter, I don't understand why he has to spoil a great story to make his drama when many many SF fans just don't care about it and want to see a story about aliens. OK , we have some cool specials effects for 10-15 min in a 2 hours movie ( well better than Deep impact who had 5 min of special effects for 3 hours of crappy talking ).For those who enjoy the original book of HG.wells in 1898 or the very cool old movie made in 1953 by George Pal (both stories didn't involve kids in it, but it seems than Steven Spilberg cannot make a movie without a kid ), this one smells the fraud.I give a 2 star for this poor movie , with a poor script , a very good original story spoiled with holes and non senses (that were not in the 2 previous versions ), some stupid clichés from the first movie made in 1953 , strangely some obvious political messages included ??? , and a medium soundtrack performed by John Williams himself who was in lack of inspiration this time , i don't blame him.The two stars go for the specials effects , and the rare exciting scenes .The ones who have put 10 stars on this movie are just some unbrainded fanatic propagandists with no objectives criticizes to argue with, the only question is who are this people , very easy customers , titanium hard core Spielberg fans or else ? I would like to say two last things , when you watch Steven Spilberg movies its like to go in a restaurant and what ever meal you order you get the same hamburger with different sauce on it , he have made some great movies but this ones will join the low B movies when the specials effects will be old in the few years to come.Also, there is no movie for adults anymore ( well OK , the porn ), nowadays to make a maximum profit, Hollywood serves us only family movies than include kids,teens and adults together , movies for everyone than are in fact movies for no one.",2,3,6,15 July 2005
300," Superb movie
","I just saw 300 , I liked the movie very much , as usual when a movie doesn't go in the 'standard Hollywood correctness' we 've got a bunch of unhappy people for some reason , here complaining about the historical mistake and so ...did the movie tried to tend to historical accuracy ...no ,it's a art action movie 'based' of a historical battle and the free adaptation is mentioned at the beginning of the movie , well ...I could have give a 9 stars but the Queen Gorgo subplot was a little bite weak and her 5 minutes speech and the even who follows was quite stupid and didn't fit with the rest of the movie.Also the movie spear us , thanks GOD, of the 'modern legend of the gay attitude' of the men from antiquity , no ,the Greeks and the Romans were NOT all gay , nothing , I repeat , nothing confirm that myth from serious studies and original archives , nothing ... Theses people have a lot of babies and survive until today with their family ...the family , base of any society since the dawn of mankind , without family , no society can survive . So yes in this movie , the Spartans are hyper-masculine or maybe they are just masculine that change from the last Alexander the great movie...Nowadays some people do not like to see men act like men...strange.This movie is special and I like it and I feel it was like a 30 minutes movie because it was good, best movie 2007 so far ...",8,3,8,19 March 2007
V for Vendetta," S for Stupid
","N for non sense , O for Otragious , L for Lame ,G for Give me back my money , and W for Wachowski brothers go to make Matrix 3 with a non crappy ending.Non sense , how the hero accomplish ALL HIS TRICKS ...???? how he can go there , have that , do that ... (with all the time a ugly mask and a stupid hat) in a total police controlled state , who knows , and the Wachowski brothers say TO YOU , who cares just watch the movie and shut up , because you -do-not-unders-tand , be-cau-se you are stupid.Otragious , a total insult to Christianity , Christianity = Nazi and pedophile is this movie , and you know what Islam is beautiful ...the Wachowski brothers know who be friend with and who they can attack in total impunity .Lame , the all story , the plot , the stupid mask , the reaction of the population watching the TV (soooo lame ...they should have take some actors , it is quite embarrassing) , the dialogs ...Give me back my money. Wachowski brothers , you have made a stupid movie but the worst of it you have insulted Christianity in the most arrogant way , I'm not against to have some bad Christians personages in a movie if the all movie is not against my faith , but hey, I forgive you , the movie is so bad than only poor mind will appreciate it .",1,5,16,8 August 2006
