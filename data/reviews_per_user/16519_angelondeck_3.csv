It," It Sucked. *May contain spoilers*
","This has got to be the most over-hyped movie ever made. I can't believe the (supposedly professional) reviews elsewhere online calling this move a smash success. They must be inflating the ratings, and suppressing bad press for this costly disaster. There was no chemistry between the kids... At. All. Beverly looked like Little Orphan Annie... She was not very good at faking a nervous smoking habit, which they tried to imply she had, and just about everything those kids did/said, was incredibly stupid. The whole thing was like a bad joke. The dialog is just insulting, and the 'scary' parts were just gore or jump scares. I was never less emotionally invested in a set of characters. I found myself wishing Pennywise would just gobble them all up and be done with it.It absolutely dragged too. About the only thing they 'improved' was the role of Henry as the murderous bully. He was truly horrific. Everything that made the original so good was missing with nothing of value added.If you've always wanted a version of IT, without any heart, humor, subtly, intrigue or fear...This your movie!Fake looking CGI's galore, plenty of predictability, as well as 'Said No One Ever' dialog, and 'I could care less about these kids' character development. Throw in ridiculousness, and throw out any hope of not being bored to death long before IT's over...And there you have it! A marvelous film for the intellectually challenged with nothing better to do.",1,11,20,17 September 2017
It," IT evokes a boring theme park ride. Nor scary, not funny over hyped and crummy!
","Very disappointing! I feel they completely destroyed the tension going the kids only route.I was hoping for the same chemistry between the kids in the Losers Club, that the miniseries had and maybe some interesting new twists in the adult parts...Instead we get a bunch of dick/yo mama 'humor', a decidedly UNscary clown, 'Said No One Ever' dialog and generic main characters we don't know enough about to care, that get methodically 'frightened' one after another until you just want to scream, ' Enough already! We get it, scary, scary CLOWN!'It was like the Goonies with a dash of E.T. and every movie cliche there is.What they did with the character of Mike was terrible. And I hear they plan on making him a drug addict in part two. Uhhggg.I had to rewatch the original mini series twice, just to cleanse my palate!",1,1,2,11 March 2018
Hereditary," Unbelievably Bad.
","If you like watching people grieve, you might enjoy the first half of this sick excuse for a 'Horror' movie because its like Bereavement Porn, Truly depressing as it gets. The circumstances surrounding Charlies beheading are completely unrealistic. First of all, no parent would insist an older teen take his young sister to a party, then once there, he, (knowing she has a peanut allergy, and no Epi-pen sends her into a kitchen full of drunk/high teens to eat, while he goes into another room to smoke weed. Uhhuh... As she goes into shock he doesn't call 911, but instead throws her into his car and races off, Hmmmm...Just as she hangs out the window, an animal appears and he has to swerve. Nice timing animal! None of this is even remotely plausible and it gets worse from there. Much, much worse.Killing off the only interesting character early on, was bad enough, the prolonged shock/grief that follows is hugely depressing, and then there is nothing to redeem having been forced to feel that bad, because there is no Horror Story in the end, just a jumble of gory imagery and a weak attempt to tie it together with a supernatural slant. It just doesn't work.",1,6,14,24 June 2018
