3:10 to Yuma," Spectacular, Gun Slingin', Bale's Best Performance Yet
","First Off, Go see this film. 3:10 to Yuma is by far the best movie I have seen all year. Bale solidifies himself as a proved actor, as if he wasn't before? (American Psycho, Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn, The Prestige) Do I have to continue? If Christian Bale does not receive an Oscar nod, the Academy should just quit giving out rewards. Crowe gives his best performance since Gladiator as a ruthless, cunning, quick-witted bad guy who steals the screen with his presence. Ben Foster's (X-Men:The Last Stand)supporting role as the quick-handed, loyal,gun-wheeling outlaw is his best character performance to date, as it should also garner a Best-Supporting Oscar nomination. James Mangold's flawless, smooth, suspenseful tale of death and morality is character driven with a film so amazing that it takes you back to the 19th century and leaves you satisfied. A Masterpiece.",Null,4,8,7 September 2007
