Kill Bill: Vol. 2," fantastic!!!
","When I first saw kill Bill vol. 1 I was so pleasantly surprised because first of all, I didn't expect I would like a Tarantino movie that much (this movie turned me into a big fan of QT!!) and second of all, that underneath this bloody, feisty plot is a great story about a great woman that is so strong and in the same time so warm, which might not be noticeable in vol. 1. The next day I bought Kill Bill soundtrack because the music swept me away, and I couldn't wait vol. 2 to come out. In a way I was afraid what to expect... WOW!!!! The biggest dilemma after seeing it was:' which one I like better?' Than I realized i DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE AT ALL. Volume 2 is all about knowing the Btide, understanding her reasons which were'n trivial at all. Music is just as good, Michael Madson, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks as s Mexican pimp... WOW! Everybody were fantastic! QT created a new world in this movie and everything makes perfect sense in it, nothing is strange (not even to me, until now, a complete kung-fu ignorant), whatever a person does, we understand, we can relate. You can even start to feel this deep connection between Bill and the Bride. The scene of his death is absolutely beautiful and again, makes perfect sense. This is a story about great women in kinky situations. I strongly recommend it. I LOVE it!!",10,3,7,18 January 2005
Am√©lie," dreamy and wonderful
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is romantic an absolute non-icky way, it shows a humans kindness in whole new lighting and Nino and Amelie share this delicate, tender, gentle love without many words said. Jean-Pierre made this film colorful like only few other people did or could do. Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet. Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film. Music goes along with the movie just great, it just right, it sets the perfect mood for the viewer. I really recommend this movie to everyone because I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!!!",10,20,34,19 January 2005
