The Hangover," Hungover from laughing so hard!
","I honestly didn't know what to expect from this movie, I knew the Director made 'Old School,' which I saw when I was young so I didn't remember or have that to fall back on, so I just went in and prayed that I was going in for a wild and fun ride.People say you should trust your instincts or go with your gut feeling, and I'm proud that I did! This movie exceeded my expectations and engrossed me with the characters, which is something I thought was only possible with Apatow films! Having said that, the comedy is very 'Old School,' (Pun intended) often relying on confusion and crazy situations instead of witty dialog which is a great change of pace.I won't go into the details about the story, as it's fairly simple, and you can just read the synopsis on the main page, but I highly recommend this film. Now I read an article about a sequel, hopefully they won't screw it up and ruin what looks like a great start here. Anyway when you see this movie, just be prepared for huge laughs, shocks, Mike Tyson, and an Asian's private parts. Enough said!",9,2,4,27 July 2009
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Why did I give this a 10?!
","I gave Resident Evil: Afterlife a 10/10 because I got exactly what I wanted out of it: GGG! Short for GIRLS, GUNS, and GORE! If you haven't figured these movies out by now, then you're most likely some loyal fan who expects too much. Yes, I am a fan of the games. But that doesn't mean I want to see an exact replica of the games. There's no suspense, you know who's going to live and die. I mean if I wanted an exact shot-for-shot Resident Evil adaptation, I would play the game! Is this film dumb? Yes. It's a guilty pleasure. And I'm fine with that. I love seeing gorgeous women kick ass, I love seeing ridiculous gore, I love being smart enough to see that this movie is NOT supposed to be Oscar-worthy. If anything this film was more fun than the previous installments, there was humor, great action, and hot chicks. Seriously folks, you should have figured this whole film series out after the second one. Don't come in with high expectations. Go with a group of friends and have a good time. If there's one thing that's absolutely incredible, it's the 3D. Probably the best since Avatar. Overall Resident Evil: Afterlife is a bloody good time. Definitely a great way to end the summer.",10,63,130,16 September 2010
The Holiday," This Is Coming From A Guy Who Hates the Hollywood System
","Hollywood is known for constantly dishing out the formulaic romantic comedy, at least nowadays. There was a time when these movies were good but they've since faded into obscurity. Fortunately I was surprised by this film which has been hailed as a 'romantic comedy.' This is where the film becomes hated by most of the male demographic. The Holiday plays out like an 'indie dramedy' right up until the last two minutes of the film, which plays very much like your standard romantic comedy.Luckily the rest of the film makes up for that. I won't go into the details of the plot, you can read the synopsis on the IMDb page. But it's definitely one of those films where you read the plot outline and think, 'It's almost too simple to be this long of a movie,' and yet the movie is filled with so much that one can relate to. Jude Law's character was certainly a surprise, an honest and likable one at that. Cameron Diaz was actually really genuine as a cynic of love. Kate Winslet was a breathe of fresh air as a heartbroken soul trying to escape from her threesome of a relationship. And Jack Black, as short as his role was, was very likable as a romantic who is blinded by love. His Blockbuster scene definitely put a smile across my face, mainly because of the unexpected cameo.... To conclude, this film is barely your run of the mill romantic comedy from Hollywood; despite the ending and poor advertising that didn't do the film any justice. There is also a lot of politics regarding the film industry. If you are a film buff, you'll certainly appreciate one of the messages that this film is carrying. I'm more into independent films, but I figured on giving this movie a try and it was definitely worth the two hours. Take a holiday and enjoy this honest film about love and it's heartbreaks. 8/10",10,7,9,3 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Finally Getting Somewhere
","Twilight was an average indie film, New Moon was a bad Hollywood film, and Eclipse is starting to get it right. Having never read the books, I have to look at this from just a movie-goers perspective. David Slade, director of the cult film, Hard Candy and the much loved/hated, 30 Days of Night, is manning the helm with this newest installment of the Twilight series. And as someone who is unbiased with this whole phenomenon, I actually enjoyed Eclipse. Pros: The acting is nowhere near as cringe worthy. The action is intense and great for us guys. The love triangle is actually worth watching. Some of the supporting characters are properly developed. The special effects are better.Cons: Slow pace at times. The awesome battle scene is too short. Still some bad dialog. Luckily it's not as bad.Basically if you're a guy who has to take a girl to see this movie, you won't be completely annoyed. David Slade managed to make this watchable and fun. Don't take it seriously. Rating: Matin√©e",6,3,9,3 July 2010
