"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Special Squirrel Time
","This could have been much better. Simon Pegg has done much better films than this. And where is his partner at? The fatter guy that was with him in his two previous films that made international waves? I guess Simon Pegg thinks he can do it himself. Boy is he wrong.This movie is about a man who tries to run. He tries to run from his troubles, from love, from the woman he knocked up (Thandie Newton), and from his dreams. Dreams be being a man and a respected one. Until Simon realizes he needs to do something drastic to keep his woman around Occasionally it has something worth of value. The antics before and during the race are OK, but they don't make it into a cult classic. And that is disappointing.Overall, its a slight miss. Better luck next time Simon and Thandie.

The Blair Witch Project," Bambi Woods loves the Blair Witch
","Let me start by saying that this is not a documentary nor does it really hide the fact that its not. The obvious switching between one camera to another without breaking audio leads one easily to conclude that. Not only that, but where was the extra juice for all the video they took? Going into the woods and being followed by someone or something. That is not scary. Sometimes the people argue with one another and improv, which was funny at one point. But that and the house scene, were the only moments that were even remotely interesting.I just wasn't impressed. Maybe adding Bambi Woods to the cast would have made things more interesting. Because there is no other reason to watch it again. 'F'",1,2,3,9 March 2008
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Bobby Witt: We miss you
","What worked pretty good for the first National Treasure film did not work so well for the 2nd one. Out to prove again the U.S. has collected treasures the world will never know, Cage comes out again to find it.Built around the same formula with the same results, Cage goes out to find a hidden treasure contained within the writings of John Wilkes Booth. Instead of being hidden by the Masons in a secret underground area, we find it is under a certain national park/memorial in South Dakota.Why did everything unfold in the same manner? Why did it seem like everybody was just going through the motions? I mean, the legendary City of Gold, Cibolo? It was kind of stupid in my opinion.I am hoping they do not make another one. It should have been left alone after the first one. Instead, its all about cheapening the brand. 'C'",5,0,0,3 October 2008
The New World," Slow, inaudible, and unwatchable
","I really had a lot of patience for this movie to get going. I sat there for over 20 minutes, in between the bad and displaced classical music, to see the plot between the characters. And nothing. The sound quality was just awful throughout and that was only the first of the major annoyances.Sure, the fort of Jamestown was accurate, but I hardly think those peoples spoke in parables and poems the entire time. The dialogue was about as misplaced as the latest Australian version of 'MacBeth', with Shakespearan language and modern scenery and weapons. Getting to the point, the dialogue was unreal in a bad way.I don't remember ever reading about Captain Smith having such a fancy sword for such an average man at the time. I wish it was more straight forward with real dialogue so the audience could get into it. The director did a much better job in Saving Private Ryan. But this was a waste of time. Thin Red Line wasn't too much better than this, but at least it was better.Overall, its unfortunate that this is the only movie with historical Jamestown shown in it. 'F'",1,10,15,26 April 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," Oten
","It is not very hard for me to start out with this statement: This is the worst movie I have seen this year. And I have seen some pretty bad movies half way through 2008. But I fail to see anything on the horizon that will challenge this heap of garbage.The premise is downright awful. A castle, a woman who becomes an old woman, a flame, and a walking castle. Already, its not looking good. But add to the fact that almost nothing happens in a lot of scenes. I had to fast forward through those areas where there wasn't any talking.I never really liked the hoping scarecrow - whom turned out to me a prince. And the flame? Well he might have been the best character in the whole film but that isn't saying much.The boy, Howl, and everybody else should never again grace screens with their presence. It just isn't worth the headache. 'F'",1,5,28,5 June 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Gwapa Débora Nascimento
","Before watching this Hulk movie, I should have taken the time to watch the one released a few years back that was directed by Ang Lee. Instead, I was given the chance to watch this and I had to take it. Seeming that this was going to be one of the year's better films, I thought why not. And it lived up to a lot of its billing.The origins of the Hulk are given, although not as explained as I would have liked. His fleeing to Brazil in the beginnings of the film do make for some good scenery, including the introduction of Débora Nascimento to the film stage. Though I doubt she will be given a lot of time on the screen for now, she certainly is a beautiful woman and made Liv Tyler pale in comparison.The action was good, but I thought it was flawed. The military operations against the Hulk just seemed to come out of the blue at times and did not explain it as much as one would hope. Even the final fight seemed a little bit of a mess. Still it was enjoyable.Overall, it was a good film. I am hoping I see more of Débora Nascimento in the future. 'B+'",7,5,9,25 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Roger Owen and Hoa Tran: best friends for life.
","Tom Cruise is a man of action. He is also a man of passion, Rain Man, and Scientology. Besides that, where else could you see a Scientologist blow stuff up? Maybe the other Mission Impossible films, but thats about it.The movie starts off well enough, with Cruise being tortured and seeing what he thinks is his wife/girlfriend/significant other near death. The viewer then backtracks through all of it. Missions to Vatican City, China, and the U.S.A. And it all comes down to some high flying in China.Many of the actions aren't explained well. How did Cruise avert all men inside the building for his prize? What about the previous woman? The list goes on.But overall, its good. I like the explosions more than anything in this film. 'B'",7,0,0,9 April 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett
","They seem like somewhat of an unlikely pair. Obviously, he looked slightly younger than her when they met. But despite that, both acted good in the movie. But I can't say the exact same for the plot.I enjoyed some of the twists, although the last two or three I kind of expected as I slowly pieced together the beginning scenes and made sense of it for the rest of the movie. It took a little bit of time for it to sink in for what was going on. Many films, when they try this sort of thing, usually don't tie everything together. But this one did.However, the camera-work was kind of weak. The somewhat constant skipping ahead slightly during the scene was slightly bothersome at some times. Plus, I kind of wished the characters were developed more.I was glad with the deaths that were inflicted and all the killings seemed thought-out. The music throughout the movie was not on far with what was happening sometimes and that got to me a little.Overall, its not a bad film. If you don't mind piecing together a movie with deaths like this, then its your cup of tea. The music, direction, and camera-work were not as great as they could be. As a result, it doesn't get the grade it could have got with a better director. The director was just bad. 'B-'",6,0,1,11 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Good Stuff
","I am not a big western fan. There are a few I like, but several I don't. But honestly, I certainly liked this one. And to make matters more, the acting department was rather good.Russell Crowe puts up an excellent performance. Playing Ben Wade, he is captured with the help of Christian Bale, who is a rancher. Through a long trek to catch a train, Crowe and Bale play off one another. Through many deaths, largely on the law's side, a drama unfolds. And the ending was even better and not your run-of-the-mill type.I do like Crowe, especially from his performance in Gladiator. This only shows how much of the arse-kicking type his is. And Bale, aka Batman, shows he can take a bullet as well. 'B+'",7,0,1,21 August 2008
The Longest Yard," Sandler movie with Burt being Burt.
","This film remake had a lot of funny moments. And those moments were brought on my the funny comedy of Adam Sandler. From the car scene, 'secret video', and a few others. I admit, I was laughing.But there are some major problems too: the storyline. It is not explained well as to why Burt Reynolds is there. Nor explained why the prison officials have a 'prison league'. Nor why ESPN covered it all of a sudden. I could never get into any of it. It had no emotional appeal.In conclusion, you solely have to wait on the comedic moments. Moments, truly, happen in rapid succession. But this isn't 'Grandma's Boy' or 'Leonard Part 6'. It is funny, just not that funny. 'B'",6,2,4,9 April 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Cloud Strife should have been the star.
","The original Indiana Jones movie. Filled with explosions, Nazis, the Ark of the Covenant, and a burned out Nepalese bar. Welcome to the world of Harrison Ford.The story is quite original, this being the first of the series, so it does have its 'wow' factors. For example, digging through the sand while getting chased by the bad guys is rather fun to see. And I certainly enjoyed most of it.However, the ending seemed a little trite. That being the cheesy effects when the Ark is opened. I know its an 80s movie, but it seemed a little too unreal for me.Overall, its well done. Harrison Ford can go home now. Abe Vigoda is waiting for him. 'B+'",7,0,1,19 March 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Actually a good CGI film
","What can I say about this film? There are certainly many stars in this one. Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Angelina Jolie just to name a few. But that doesn't always been a good movie. It has to have a good plot and this one actually does.Looking for the 'Dragon Warrior' (yes, very cliché), a furry animal warrior is sought. And Jack Black's overweight panda is found. With no kung fu experience, he is looked down upon by others. But yet a miracle takes place.This actually is somewhat of a fun movie. I know many CGI films that just bust, but this not only had star power but a good plot as well.So overall, its good. 'B'",7,0,1,31 December 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Mila Kunis is like Lucy Liu, maybe.
","This is like 'Good Luck Chuck' meets 'Along Came Polly'. The result is a movie that has more male nudity than female. And also some strange cut scenes that somewhat resemble Family in a strange and perverted way.Anyway, a man loses his famous girlfriend. Somehow they meet up in Hawaii when he is trying to get away from her and she is trying to have a relationship with a rocker. Throw in some odd ball honeymooners and Mila Kunis as part of the wait staff and you got some sort of movie on speed pills.Jason Segel, who is not the best looking man in the world, shows the world who he is in more than one way. And I was intrigued with Mila Kunis in this movie, whom I have seen in 'That 70s Show'. She is more beautiful than many actresses that I have seen and should be given that.Overall, strangely funny. 'B-'",6,1,6,31 December 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Too much hype.
","When I first heard about a film based on the books by C.S. Lewis, I was hoping something as good as LOTR by Tolkien. Those two ere good friends and thus maybe the films about their books would be in the same category of great movies. Not by a long shot The setup and imagery of the film are very good. Loads of well detailed places that can leave you in awe. The castle of the witch is nicely detailed and I thought the wolf guards were well done.However, the flow of everything else is lukewarm. The characters of the children are OK, but they are missing with those outside the children. Nor does the film explain a lot about the children, at least not in the beginning.Plus, the fights and battles certainly don't inspire much out of a person who loved LOTR. Instead, they were disappointing and mildly funny in a bad way.Overall, this is average. And for so much hype, that is not good. 'C'",5,3,5,3 October 2008
The Notebook," Chuck Baldwin won't be President
","I have to admit, it is OK to watch to a degree. The story isn't too bad in trying to tell the story of a young love. However, it is easy to pick up early on that the old man telling the story is the husband of the woman is having memory lapses repeatably.The story is rather corny to some extent. Its a love than can't be contained by social standards and norms. That is apparent during the love story with the servants of African descent. But having any servants shows prestige. The man is from a construction family. They aren't the elites, but many construction workers make rather good money with enough experience.Anyway, the ending is fitting for the couple, but it isn't all to surprising considering the condition the film shows both of them to be in. And lets not forget, both of them broke hearts and family relations to be together. They certainly caused pain for their love. But, overall its average. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled. 'C'",5,1,2,26 April 2008
Madagascar," If you write, they will come...and rob your house.
","Well, it certainly is not the best CGI film I have ever seen. In fact, it is not even in the top 10, and that is just getting started. I am not trying to be mean, but this was not a good film. And no, its not just because they paired Chris Rock with Ben Stiller.Seriously, Stiller and Rock? Well I guess I can see how they would be locked away in a prison cell and have to fight with each other over pieces of bacon and raw fish, but not on an animated movie. Even though the thought of Ben Stiller trying to eat Chris Rock in real life brings me some small chuckles.Anyway, the CGI isn't well done. Not only that, but the characters aren't well developed. I still don't know how this pair landed in the zoo. Then again...Overall, not a good CGI film. 'D+'",3,0,0,31 December 2008
Alexander," Alexander the Average
","The movie was long and there is no way around that. Yes, I have watched plenty of movies just as long or longer, but this one took more time to get to less places. And just to make it better, have the battle sequences use some less that appealing scenery and music for the mood.It is a problem if one of the best features of the movie was the love/hate passion scene between Colin Farrell and Rosario Dawson. It was a scene where Alexander's love overcomes his new wife's hate. But more people were paying attention to the nudity both were showing. And since Dawson is the lesser known, people surely got to know her great looks.I thought the story was OK. But for a historical epic, that is a problem. There should have more more about the battles he fought and less about his romantic escapades. And Angelina Jolie as Farrell's mother? That made no sense.Overall, it is mildly entertaining. But I wanted more action for such a long movie. 'C+'",6,2,2,16 June 2008
Juno," Michael Cera and Jason Bateman
","A teenage movie about pregnancy, music, Certs, and oh yeah pregnancy. None of that teenage melodrama you usually expect. Instead boy wins girl, its girl wins boy - after being knocked up by boy and giving up child for adoption. Yeah, not your normal teen movie.Anyway Ellen Page plays the knocked up teen girl that had relations with Michael Cera. Since she doesn't plan to keep it, she plans on giving the child to Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Yet, it almost completely falls apart.Its funny since Bateman and Cera were both on 'Arrested Development' on Fox a few years back, so apparently they have some chemistry. And Ellen Page? Well I don't know.Anyway, Page it pretty funny with her absurd wacky humor. So give it a try while eating Certs. 'B'",7,0,4,31 December 2008
Cloverfield," Just never gets going
","This truly bring back the 'Blair Witch' style of filming, except this was a little better. Although Blair Witch was more vague and it felt like it could happen up to a point. This, however, was very much pure fantasy.The problem with this fantasy is that it fails to really scare the audience. True the monsters were nicely done. However I wish it were a little more scary since it was let on as a real fantasy type film The ending was a little strange. I wish there was a clue that the creature could do such a thing, but its never let on until it happens. And it would have been nice to see how it ended up after the final scene in the movie.The plot holes were intentional to give it a 'real' feel, but I sorely missed them. As a result, this film suffered. It could have been great. 'C-'",4,0,1,2 October 2008
Crash," Put it in the Microwave
","This is a movie on how people can collide unexpectedly. And sometimes it seems realistic with some over-reacting towards each other. However, they are at extremes.The bitter racism that comes out in this film is real to an extent, but it plays it that almost everybody is racially bias towards the other, which in today's society is still true. But the pure guile of it that this shows is not so true anymore, except in more isolated areas. However I am not denying that its still there.As far as the story goes, it really doesn't come off as something that made me want to watch this again. The characters over-compensate and go towards opposite extremes, including deaths for really dumb reasons.If this film does anything it can make those that still have prejudice, no matter the race, think twice. But as far as entertainment value goes, its not too great.Overall, not much. Better luck next time. 'C-'",4,4,8,3 October 2008
Nacho Libre," Hatagi halok ta imo nobya.
","I did not think this would be a great movie. But I wasn't sure how good it could be. I found out it wasn't so bad. In fact, it had its moments in being funny, but other times it was not so great.The look of Jack Black in tights sums up the movie. He prances around trying to be a Mexican wrestler. And for most of the time, he gets his arse handed to him. Pretty funny seeing those different wrestlers beat him up.Of course, it has a happy ending (well, kind of). Jack Black fails at love in not violating his vows, but they both don't seem to mind. Mr. Black lives off the land - only 50 yards away from the nearest urban sub-dwelling.But enough with the random thoughts about the movie in non-chronological order. The movie isn't bad. What is with Jack Black with nuns and toast? Anyway, not bad. Have a try. 'B-'",6,0,1,15 April 2008
Elf," I was surprised
","Will Ferrell seems like he will dive off the deep end of a 3 foot pool just to get a laugh. And, this was no exception. And I have to admit, I was laughing almost the entire time.Will just can't make a typical family movie. He injects not only humor, but humor that makes you cry when you watch. Acting like a complete kid, he plays the part of a regular human that grew up as an elf.Not knowing how to act in a human environment, he resorts to the strangest behavior. From sending his father women's clothing, to taking his date to a turnstile and running around a turnstile.Will Ferrell won me over. Much like his work 'Kicking and Screaming', he takes what could have been a bomb and does something funny with it. I am impressed. 'A'",9,0,2,27 August 2008
Hot Rod," Hot Rod Zoidberg!
","Let me start out by saying: this was a funny movie. Its plain ridiculous in the way it presents itself. Obviously, a young man who screws up every stunt he does is quite funny.The first two stunts were just laugh out loud funny. The first, the unsecured ramp jump over a van that turns out so horribly executed that its funny. Then next was the flat ending to the pool jump, which ended with a small dive into the pool. What made it even funnier was that the girl he was chasing was watching.In many ways, the character reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite. Geeky, ordinary, but funny when combined. Some of the scenes were just wacky, but some were asinine in the way it was delivered.Overall, some of the bits wore out on me. But many of them had great staying power. Well worth it to a person who loves insane wacky movies that seem to make no sense. Just like 'Leonard Part 6' and 'Balls of Fury'. And you just have to love the Taco v. Sandwich fight.

21," Liza LaPira is dating Alf
","'21' should give away a portion of the movie when you see the title and the posters. Its a group of people who are in Vegas and playing to win - via card counting. Illegal by Casino rules, but it is practiced at times nonetheless.Spacey trains a group of students to bring down the 'house' in Vegas with this scheme. So he takes them there - all the while getting the students off at the university and giving them automatic grades. But if you cross Keving SPacey, things can get ugly.This film has three different mini-plots in the film. And they are weaved together in a very good way. It has that sort of everybody wins ending, but its Hollywood. That is supposed to happen so the audience can feel better.But I liked it. But it needed more Liza LaPira. 'B+'",7,1,2,31 December 2008
American Psycho," Lets go to Zamboanga
","Sometimes, reality is just not good enough. That is where movies, like this, come in to play. Where else would you see a young man lose control over simples things like business cards and start killing people, including co-workers, friends, and many prostitutes.This is, indeed, a dark psychological thriller. Things get really fun at the end. Numerous deaths, nudity, and leading double lives. But it all goes away with one one call. I guess if you are powerful, at least in this movie, you can get out of about any trouble.A really dark movie. Its strange, funny, and interesting all at the same time. Give it a try, it might be your taste. But then again, it might want you to take out the DVD and throw it away. 'B'",7,0,1,2 March 2008
Over the Hedge," Stealing from bears and Bill Cosby
","Bruce Willis? In an animated movie? Once you get over that, it turns out to be OK. Sure, Shatner is in it too. But I can see Shatner as a furry animal. Not so much Bruce Willis.However, it turns out to be rather good. Willis voices RJ, a raccoon who steals from a bear. And everybody else suffers from his plan at paying the bear back.Of course, Willis learns his lesson and wants to be good and is the common mantra of almost every kid movie out there. Still it works and it makes this movie watchable.I wish there was more Shatner, but I can make due. So overall: 'B-'",6,0,0,1 October 2008
Jarhead," That old bat from Santa Fe
","Jamie Foxx seems to like the military movies. This, and the later 'The Kingdom', focus on Jamie portraying himself as an American Soldier in hostilities in the Middle East. And this one is focused on Desert Storm back in 1991.Even though Foxx is in this, he isn't the main character. Jake Gyllenhaal's movie persona is what this is primarily about. Joining the Marines and going to Iraq. But it doesn't show a glamorous military, but some of the uglier sides. Mutiny, losing control, insubordination, drunkenness, frustration, and the like. Troops go through the ups and downs of being away from their woman, some of them losing their woman as they go off to fight.There were several times it was funny, especially in the first twenty minutes. Also, there are times it gets slow and melodramatic. After the short war that Desert Storm was, the men in this drama go home and we are shown how they turned out a few years later.Overall, its slightly above average. The drama sometimes was overblown. But also at times it was funny. Give it a go if you wish. 'C+'",6,0,0,18 June 2008
Enchanted," James Marsden is the next Jaleel White
","For something that looked entirely corny. this became somewhat of an absurdist view of the enchanted fairy tales. It is a 'what if' scenario. What if fairy tale characters got to come to the real world and experience the ups and downs of real life? The answer isn't too far off in this film.Set in New York City, each character experiences life for the first time. Much like 3rd Rock from the Sun, the characters have a hard time making out what things do. So you get James Marsden arguing with the TV, Amy Adams using rats and roaches to clean an apartment, and Susan Surandon being Susan Surandon. And don't forget James Marsden stabbing that bus - thinking he is freeing some peasants.In the end, it becomes more normal like and loses its buzz. But its still nice. 'B'",7,0,0,31 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," Was well worth my time
","I didn't watch this movie because of the book or Tommy Lee Jones. In fact, I don't know why exactly that I watched such a movie. But after it was over I knew I enjoyed the viewing.What made this whole movie was Javier Bardem's character. He is just one of the best psychotic killers I have ever seen. The air tank to punch open locks on doors and the giant silencer on his shotgun just shot him up to mythic proportions.Javier also had a strange Two-Face character in him. Sometimes deciding who lives and dies via a coin. What happens at the end with his character was also a shock, since I did not read the book or see any spoilers Tommy Lee Joes seemed like a 2nd rate character throughout much of the movie. Josh Brolin's character had a much more prominent role than Jones's and so did Bardem's.Overall, its very likable. 'A-'",8,1,3,1 October 2008
The Love Guru," This was a movie?
","I shouldn't be surprised this turned into a movie. After all, Toxic Avenger, The Evolved, Space Jacked, etc. are all movies too. But then again this movie has some actual talent with Myers, Alba, and even Timberlake has some acting talent too.Anyway, Myers plays a Hindu guru who seems to be an expert in love with everybody but himself. He tries to help out a black hockey player win back his woman from Timberlake, whom somehow gets his woman. Then crazy sex themed scenes come into play.Myers seems to be a one-show pony. But you might as well ride it until it falls down and dies. You only live once, right? Still I would have thought a little bit more effort would be put into this film.Overall, its sub-par. Could have been better. 'D+'",4,1,7,31 December 2008
Peaceful Warrior," Thaddaus Hill and Gordon F. Bailey...
","I will be open and honest here. I did not really enjoy this movie. There I said the truth and the truth is all that matters. Not only was there a lack in acting, but script, drama, and action.The story is about a young gymnast who has an injury. He is down and out and seems he won't make it again. But then you have the gas station 'zen master', for lack of a better term, who changes his life. You can only guess that, yes, he overcomes his injury and coach's objection and becomes involved in the sport again.None of this really worked for me. In fact the only part I really enjoyed was the mugging scene. It was the strangest mugging scene I have seen because the 'zen master' helps the muggers by suggesting what to take after they are about to leave. Needless to say, seeing two men walk away in only their undergarments was quite funny.But the film was not saved with that scene. Everything else is predictable and quite boring. Nothing original so I can't give it a high grade. 'D-'",2,7,10,2 October 2008
Stardust," Chuck Baldwin would not approve, but nobody cares.
","Let me open up and say that I did not expect this to be a great film. And while that opinion was not in vain, I found out it isn't the type of film that will make your head hurt. Suffice to say, I found it slightly entertaining. And while the characters were unbelievable, it was meant to be that way.A young man ventures across the wall and meets a woman. She is trapped, but she has a nice 'time' with him. He goes back, and 9 months later a baby boy is delivered to him. That boy grows up and tells he will capture a star for a young woman. But instead, he falls for the star that happens to be a woman.What happens next is a series of events that leads on a wild journey chased by princes, witches, and flying pirates. I had a food laugh at Robert DeNiro showing his effeminate side and dressing like a woman. Of all the characters that had to make homosexual, he was the one. But it wasn't in a overt 'I'm nude and i like the same sex', but simple and trying to best fulfill his father's wishes.Some parts were funny, like the continuing joke with the dead brothers bickering in the after life. But through it all, I was OK with it. Maybe one day I will see it again. 'C+'",6,1,4,28 April 2008
I Am Legend," Alice Braga
","Will Smith is the main man of this film. In fact, he is pretty much the only man in this film and the only acting talent for the majority of it. And that is to be expected, since every Will Smith movie is about Will Smith and his athletic prowess.Set in New York, Smith is all about surviving and finding a cure for this disease/virus that turns people into a zombie/vampire like creature. Along the way, he encounters Alice Graga, who happens to be very nice looking.I did enjoy some things about the movie. Hunting with an M4 assault rifle while driving a Mustang certainly was unexpected. That just isn't a common occurrence. And the ending wasn't quite as expected as a usual Hollywood ending, which was sort of refreshing.Overall, its a moderately good but strange film. 'B-'",6,0,0,18 August 2008
School of Rock," Jack Black keeps on going
","Jack Black as a rocker is something that has been done before. He seems to emphasize the 80s in some untraditional ways. And in this role, well, its his style. Something not to brag about, but not to keep kids away from either.Black plays himself as a sub at a private school. While he is bored of traditional learning, he discovers they can play musical instruments and decides to use it for his last chance at rock stardom. Parents, of course, don't like the development and neither does his best bud's woman, who tries to sabotage him.But, in the end, Jack Black gets his under-15 band and they all seem to work well together. I doubt it will be like that 5 years down the road. 'C+'",6,1,1,31 December 2008
Children of Men," Very Flawed
","What do you get when humanity can't produce any offspring? Well, somehow chaos has broken out. That is, except in the U.K. where their government has kept themselves together and regularly bus immigrants to prison-like ghettos. Does that get you going? The film has all the makings of a high octane action drama. Problem is, drama from what? People wanting to kill the children and snuff out humanity? This made no sense.And it remains so until you see the commentary by people who made the film. Then it becomes all to obvious: a film against globalization. Then it becomes quite obvious that the producers have a major political bias (read: 'Farenheit 9/11') that is bad on facts and lousy on production.Overall, the film did not much to further their cause for anti-globalization. And the film suffers enough without that bias.Overall: 'D'.",3,3,4,1 October 2008
The Dark Knight," One of the best I have seen
","I am not much for giving perfect scores in movies, but this one deserved it. Nevermind the hype around Heath Ledger before this movie was released. His role was top notch and Christian Bale was none too bad either. And seeing it on opening weekend certainly made everything feel right.This is a 'return of the Joker', so to speak, because the Joker has been done before in 1989 'Batman' movie with Jack Nicholson. And while he did a good job, Ledger's version was much more sinister and believable. And I liked that 'wicked' side of the Joker.The weapons for Batman seem to keep getting better. Armed with a tank-like car and sonar tech, just for beginners, he can do or see just about anything. The only downside to Batman was his constant growling.It will be interesting if they decide to do the Joker in the near future or even Harley Quinn. But I think for certain they will bring out Two-Face again.Overall, best Batman movie I have ever seen and certainly is up there with the Spider-Man movies. 'A+'",10,4,10,3 October 2008
National Treasure," If only I had taken Harvey Birdman instead of Harley Quinn...
","Ah, we all know Mr. Cage too well. Afer all, who else would be better in bringing down a bunch of hardened criminals on a plane or finding buried treasure? Certainly not Tom Hanks, although maybe Johnny Depp.Cage is the son of several generations of treasure hunters. And he wants to capture all the world's best items, including things hidden by the Founding Fathers of the USA. So he, with a couple of dimwitted guys and a nice 30-something woman, they steal the Declaration of Independence.Yes, the idea in reality is a little crazy. But for this movie, it does work. The Masons, like all treasure theories, are involved in hiding such a treasure. And Cage has to fend off a former partner to get his hands on the gold.I certainly know the movie is fake in the regard of history conspiracy theories. But was entertaining, unlike 300.So overall, not bad. 'B'",7,2,2,3 October 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter
","It did not take long for a book about a young wizard to turn into 7 books at 5 movies so far. And while I am not a fan of this by far, its an OK film to watch.This movie introduces the world to Daniel Radcliffe and J.K. Rowling. Radcliffe, the protagonist of this film, is a young boy who is invited to join the wizard school Hogwarts. Though he never heard about it before, he eventually gets to join despite his family not wanting him to know about it.It seems to be an adventure about finding out who his dead parents are and why they are dead. To a lesser extent, its about the stone hidden at the school. But that seems to be only a side adventure.The movie moves kind of slow at several times, but the acting isn't bad. But bearing in mind the set and the limitations of the book, it did a good enough job. Though it seems that Harry always had an exception made for him.Overall, its OK. Not great. 'C+'",6,0,0,3 October 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Unggoy for life.
","Harry Potter seems that he cannot be defeated in anything. And this movie proves such an ideal. Potter/Radcliffe is entered into a tournament for wizards of a certain age. However, Radcliffe is not of that age, but is allowed to do it anyway.You get to see Radcliffe having to battle through the 'Triwizard Tournament'. Its a decathlon-type of match spaced out over several days. And Potter, despite being at a disadvantage, is able to score special points here and there and able to go to the final round. That comes of no surprise. After all, its Radcliffe. He can always win.Voldemort, the main antagonist of the film series, is for the first time seen with a full body to fight against Radcliffe. And while the battle is 1-on-1, Radcliffe doesn't seem a match for him. Thus you, as the viewer, are not surprised Radcliffe wins the tournament.Its another OK film to watch in the Harry Potter series. You have descent acting, average script, and good visual effects. Seems to be the formula for success. 'C+'",6,0,0,3 October 2008
The Happening," I've seen better acting on C-SPAN
","Was this supposed to be a movie? Or a high quality film? I am confused, did Dennis Rodman get married again and require more coverage? For all the hype surrounding this one, it was pathetic. There was nothing to this movie and I do mean nothing. If I wanted to watch somebody run from the wind for 90 minutes, I would have hired Jim Carrey or Al Gore. At least they would have made it entertaining.I understand the plot, but it was stupid. The plants were upset and so they poison the air? Wouldn't that just dissipate with distance? And effect nearby areas? It seemed to stop in certain places and that was dull.No more running from the wind. Instead, I rather watch Will Ferrell pass the wind. 'F'",1,5,11,27 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Return to Never Never Land.
","Daniel Radcliffe is back and this time he is slightly older but still the same Potter. Only this time, there is a flying car and a diary involved. Does this sound great to you? Maybe it does, but for me I needed something more.Radcliffe and his buddy Gint use the family car to fly around and leave fending for itself on the Hogwarts campus. This is much like 'Ernest Goes To Camp', when the golf cart drives itself around and shows up almost when you least expect it. However, the car is not as funny.For me the Diary of Tom Riddle is OK. Near the end of the film when you find out who Tom Riddle is, and its not Peter Pan, it makes alright sense. Combined with the fight with the serpent near the end and you have an OK movie.Like the first one its slow in some parts, somewhat entertaining in others. Overall, its slightly above fair.

Hancock," Will Smith
","There is only so much that can be said about actor Will Smith, but most of that would be good. And despite some minor flaws here and there, Hancock provided an interesting twist on the superhero movies. And I think that is a good thing.Smith plays a drunken hero who doesn't know how to limit himself in anyway, including his strength. Will Smith plays a great drunken hero. The the twist happens that many people have talked about. And while it wasn't the best twist of all time, it changed the momentum of the movie.Overall, I really did like the characters of the film. So many of the 'hero' movies are all the time to such a great extent. This one portrays heroes in a much different light. Plus with Will Smith, it does a good job. So I liked it.

The Good Shepherd," Bob Barr will not be POTUS
","The advertising was that this movie was CIA version of the 'Godfather'. However upon watching it, I could not really find that. The Godfather was all about the mafia, respect, and loads of revenge killings on top of honor in NYC. This was about a man setting up the CIA and his problems.I have no problems with the film beyond that except for its length. There is some good storyline in this film. Although a lot of the time it was tedious detail. But beyond those moments, there were several interesting parts. I like the give and take with the Russians and I was intrigued by the ending.Overall, its not bad. But surely its no Godfather. 'B-'",6,0,1,30 May 2008
The Queen," Want to buy a used handkerchief?
","Ah, the Queen of England, Scotland, Wales, North Ireland, the British Commonwealth, and future Queen of Gibraltar and York Peppermint Patties. This is a film about something many of us remember. I certainly do, although not to the extent a lot of people remember it.This film is a tribute to the current Queen and former Prime Minister Tony Blair. About how the two interacted with each other at the time of Diana's death. And it does provide some clue into their personalities.While I enjoyed the focus on those two, I wish there was more. Wish to have seen others who were around during that period. We only see too briefly other members of the British Royal Family and the movie comes off flat-footed at times.So overall, its mildly OK. But I can't give it anything higher. 'C+'",6,2,4,3 October 2008
Iron Man," Can Alf be in Iron Man 2?
","What can't be said about Iron Man? It has an excellent cast with Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Terrence Paltrow. The action is great, even for superhero films, and the script is very good. And you get a brief glimpse into the history of the Iron Man character before he becomes Iron man, which isn't done very often.I certainly like the original crude armor be made for himself. Seemed much darker in a way and how it was just very tough old armor that was put together. The newer armor, while it could fly, could not look as crude and menacing.And its a shame Howard will not be back for the 2nd Iron Man movie. But that is OK, so long as it is well made I will watch it. And if its a train wreck, which I doubt, then I will still watch.One of the best superhero fictions I have seen. 'A'",9,2,5,31 December 2008
Blade Runner," Origin of Roger Owen: an affair with Giannibicego Hoa Tran.
","Let me start by saying that this film is not a masterpiece. There is nothing masterful about the slow plot and lack of acting. A.I. had much better acting, and when it comes to the story it explored the concept of 'human' much better.In this future, there are flying cars, androids with 4 year life spans, and Harrison Ford. While all three could be in the future, it isn't very likely right now. And the worst part is, the weapons aren't even as cool as Star Wars.Ford falls for an android, but a special one. Will he have android future? Possible. But I know that those children will probably want a career. And I don't think that is worth it.Overall, this movie is sub par. It has descent content, but its long, lacks action, and the story is flat. Just not enough to keep me interested. Harrison Ford has done much better work in his life. Even recent works have been better. Not a Top 100 American film of all time. 'D+'",4,2,12,9 April 2008
Ben-Hur," When Heston wasn't shooting apes...
","Certainly this is one of those old movies that just wowed audiences worldwide 50 years ago. The numbers of extras, costumes, budget, length of the movie made it seem very important. The awards were also numerous. However, I am coming from a different generation and I am not as sure about those awards.In spite of that doubt, it does turn out to be a fairly good movie. But certainly not great. The length made it somewhat boring at times. I was on the edge of my seat for other long movies like LOTR, Star Wars, and Spider-Man. But when there wasn't something happening, it just droned on.Heston puts on a great job and the chariot race was still excellent. Obviously the ship battle was green screened, but what do you expect from the 50s? CGI? Overall, its not bad. Worth at least one look from any movie goer. 'B-'",6,3,9,30 May 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Better than Golden Girls.
","With movies that are supposed to capture historic events, you never know what you are going to get. Sometimes you get movies like Saving Privte Ryan that entertain all audiences. And sometimes you get films like 300 that are over-bloated, over-dramatized, and way over-fictionalized that entertain some but not all.And then there is this - a movie that is fairly accurate and has nice acting. This is a movie that plays into the British arena of drama and history. While the story is good, the direction is OK. There simply wasn't enough of the defeat of the Spanish Armada and their French allies to entertain all.And while I did enjoy the rest of it, I still wanted that. If there is more on the fighting, then this film becomes a masterpiece. Instead, it receives a ho hum reception. So overall, its nicely done but well short of perfection. 'B'",7,0,0,5 June 2008
Beowulf," Win Beowulf's money
","There come times when tales are retold for modern audiences. Not only that, but to tell it in a way that it is almost a new story. And that is the result here in the CGI 2007 version of Beowulf.The story was changed in such a way that the original hero Beowulf loses his edge. Instead of killing Grendel's mother, Beowulf spares her and gives her a son. Much like the king, that Beowulf came to save, did before him. And so he lies about it the rest of his life. Which makes the character less interesting because it doesn't stick to the epic.The CGI is rather well done. The action was good as well as the acting. However, the story and direction weakened so it doesn't get the marks a great film would get. 'B-'",6,0,0,1 March 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Harrison Ford loves the Mojave Desert.
","After downgrading some in the 2nd attempt, Indiana Jones is back. And this time, he searches for the Holy Grail. No it isn't a funny cheesy search like that of Monty Python, but one of adventure and Nazis.Ford seems to have a thing for fast women. And he makes no exception here with courting a woman who is of the enemy. But trouble is, his father also courted her. Sort of creepy when you think about it.The effects, like when the water from the Holy Grail has been consumed by somebody, it is magical. Same thing with the fake one, except is caused a cheesy death. but I guess that is part of its charm.Nazis dying wasn't the only fun things to see. The scene where Adolf Hitler signs Harrison Ford's map for the Grail was classic. This movie had many more circumstances like that.Overall, its was rather well done. If some of the cheesiness was done away with, it could have had a better script. But then again, you need comic relief. Have a try at this movie and see. 'B+'",7,0,1,19 March 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Matt Damon in snow shoes
","The Bourne series has certainly surprised me in how good it can really be. Based upon a fictional book series, Bourne is pretty much your super-spy without the endless relationships with women like James Bond. And in a strange yet exceptional way, I like that.Bourne is the name he is given and his missions were fore a black government program. But when that all shuts down, they try to kill him and frame him for certain murders. And when a certain person in his life is killed because of it, Bourne takes exception to it all.There are some nice car chases and shootouts in the movie. Plus some of the kills were just nice. While it isn't 'Hitman' or 'Shooter' in that regard, it does a good enough job.Overall, nicely done. I actually want to see more now to see if they get better. 'B'",7,0,1,31 December 2008
Princess Mononoke," Huh?
","I just cannot believe this one got so many names. Billy Bob Thornton? Gillian Anderson? Minnie Driver? Were they all arrested for driving while intoxicated and had to do this as their community service?Seriously, the story and the characters are flawed. A demon that is the War God, surrounded by worm-like creatures that give it its power. While I am all about culture and learning, this made me less inclined to want to know Japanese mythology.I just had a bad time watching it. The promise of action quickly fell to the wayside and nothing of entertainment value happened. That Roger Ebert likes this movie just confirms that he has to be the worst movie critic of all time. Avoid this movie. 'F'",1,11,85,18 August 2008
