Blade Runner 2049," Better than the Original!
","30 years ago, a certain rain-drenched replicant said the immortal words: 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe'. With director Dennis Villeneuve we can finally see just some of those 'things'. That's the really brilliant thing about BLADE RUNNER 2049: the design and the vision.Villeneuve has created a beautiful, fascinating and vivid dystopian world. We see such poignant, beautiful things: a room bathed in golden water reflections, giant holographic ballerinas, a stunning version of Las Vegas in orange dust, a futuristic hover car immersed in rainwater and finally, a man passing away amidst a snowfall. The scope and vision of the world is really breathtaking, the colours are beautiful and vibrant and really transform the film. This obviously is in-debt to the cinematography captured brilliantly by Roger Deakins. He showcases the world to the uttermost of his and the camera's abilities in the same way the original. However the really great thing about the film was how it took a theme and expanded so much on it. The film is very philosophical in the same way as the original as it explores what it means and how it feels to be human. Emotions like love and real memories are all explored in the film in great depth. For example, a man is so in love with a hologram that the hologram projects herself over a real woman so they can finally make love. Scenarios like this are just some of the poignant, philosophical parts to this film. It's powerful storytelling and science fiction at its best. Hapton Fescher has written a story that grips with it's running plot and multi-layered characters. However, it's nothing THAT new and it's not much of a mystery since you can simply figure out what's what but it's still engaging and action-packed.The action in the movie is very well-done. It hinges on the original movie but still does it's own thing. It's brutal and sometimes bloody but goes bigger and better than the first movie. This was part of the problem for one scene where Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), a replicant creator who's a replicant himself, murders a female replicant he's just awakened. It's a perverted scene and ruined part of the film for me but I still managed to enjoy this neo-noir piece overall.Of course, the movie is really carried by it's brilliant cast and I must say almost all of the cast is on top form. There were 4 standout performances and 1 decidedly poor performance in the film. To begin with, Ryan Gosling as Officer K. Gosling gives an absolutely brilliant performance as K and acts out real anger and sadness but also loneliness. It's a very raw performance and a very emotional one too. Next, there is of course, Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard. It's wonderful to see him pick up his role after 30 years and carry on the same. He plays a grump, old, cynic but also quite a vulnerable man who's lost a lot in life and Ford plays all of that very strongly. There were then the 2 female standouts with Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks. Armas gives a touchingly emotional performance as the holographic Joi. She plays a character almost like Oz's tin man and you really care about her and k's romance. Sylvia Hoeks is brilliant as the monstrous Luv. She plays a murderous brute of a replicant, uncaring and unfeeling. She's like a female version of Roy Batty. Only, he knew when to spare life, she doesn't! She's really a villainess you can loath but the acting is just so powerhouse from Hoeks. However, the 1 bad performance in the movie was Jared Leto as Niander Wallace. Let's acting is bland and two dimensional and he basically reads the script out loud. Disappointing among such a stellar cast.However, this was a film that delivered an engaging and stunningly beautiful sequel to a classic. It gives us a proper adventure (unlike the original) that's almost like a STAR WARS movie, that really moves the story onwards. It's not an enjoyable movie but it's certainly a fine movie that grips and dazzles, and breaths new life into an old classic...",8,1,10,13 February 2018
The Death of Stalin," Insane, Hilarious and Riveting!
","It's one of the darkest periods in modern history! Filled with mass killings, executions, rape, torture and most of all, authorized murder! I know this makes it sound like the movie might be flippant since IT IS a comedy, but be assured: The Death of Stalin is a Black Comedy masterpiece! Masterpiece, does describe this film well: a masterpiece in directing, writing, acting, casting AND comedy! But the first two, we really have Armando Iannucci to thank! Both his writing and directing of this film are simply brilliant!His writing: one thing I noticed about this film after seeing it, was how even though it really made me laugh was how brilliantly it portrayed the madness, political backstabbing and shear lunacy of those dark times. The script is a brilliant and dynamic piece of writing! It's sharp, cynical and absolutely hilarious! One thing I look for and often don't find in modern comedies is actual comedic material, but I'm happy to say that in The Death of Stalin I actually found material that really made me laugh! Several scenes: the actual death of Stalin, moving his body, Paul Whitehouse dialogue, the appearances of Stalin's crazy children, Stalin's funeral and the arrival of Field-Marshal Zhukov are just some of the brilliant and hilarious sketches in the movie. But as I was saying, this movie really shows just how crazy the events at that time were, and to simplify: C orders B to shoot A and then has D shoot B, then E orders D to execute C but then F has G kill E and D... You get the picture, and Iannucci writes all that brilliantly. There are sequences in this film that resemble a Tarantino stand-off! Now I've reviewed his writing, onto his directing. In this area, Iannucci excels also! Every single member of the cast is on TOP-FORM and all deliver hilarious and authentic performances! Steve Buscemi is a very enjoyable presence as Khrushchev. He plays someone trying to keep on top of the slippery political pyramid and trying to stay alive, and he plays that character really well, with authenticity and charisma! That is not something you can say about Simon Russel Beale as the monster that was Lavrentiy Beria! He plays the part very well and shows the complete sadistic monster that Beria was. Here was a man that would use the power he had to punish and murder many innocent people, here was also a vile rapist and Beale plays that so well that when his death and subsequent incineration comes, you actually are a little glad! Jeffrey Tambor also delivers a very enjoyable and real performance as Georgy Malenkov and delivers the line: 'when I said 'no problem', what I meant was 'no...problem' brilliantly! There are of course the hilariously crazy performances of Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough as Stalin's children. They're both absolutely crazy but play that craziness really well and with real zest! But (for me) the real highlight of the cast was Jason Isaacs as Field Marshall Zhukov. He delivers a hilarious performance as the OTT, violent, Yorkshire- accented Russian war hero. He's simply ringing with charisma! The rest of the cast including Michael Palin, Olga Kurylenko, Paul Whitehouse and several others really deliver smart and funny performances as well that have real charisma and comedy in them. This film really delivered with all these factors and I really did love it and so would certainly recommend this brilliant comedy to anyone...FINALLY, an actually funny modern comedy!",9,33,58,24 October 2017
Darkest Hour," A Fascinating And Gripping Look At One Of Britain's Greatest Heroes!
","It was definitely Britain's DARKEST HOUR but it was most certainly Winston Churchill's finest hour. He led the country at a dangerous and most uncertain time against the monster that was Hitler. He encountered opposition and political backstabbing at almost every turn from the likes of Neville Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax, but most of all he refused to give in and resolved to fight on to the bitter end. This rousing story is brilliantly brought to modern life by director Joe Wright with DARKEST HOUR! Wright's film is a tore du force of character acting (since this film is carried by the cast) and offers an informative and inspiring look at the great man and his struggle to lead Britain through the war. I must admit, before this film I knew very little about this titan of a man. I knew him as the Prime Minister who led us through the war. I knew him for his gruff voice, cigars, whiskey and infamous speeches, but after this film I realised he was so much more than that. I realised he was an incredible patriot who cared deeply about this country and it's people but I also saw that he was really the only one (in government) with enough guts to stand up to Hitler. With DARKEST HOUR, director Joe Wright and script writer Anthony McCarten have brilliantly portrayed Churchill and all his characteristics. They have brought REAL drama to his political campaign and also, even though we know the ending (we won!) they have still managed to create that sense of doom and gloom and uncertainty that surrounded the period. Wright has really delivered with this film, showcasing Churchill in all his glory and explaining the character of the man himself. However, as I said this film is carried by the cast and it's the cast that really make the film the masterpiece that it is. Let's begin with the man himself...I can wholeheartedly say that Oldman has really earned his Bafta. As well as being virtually unrecognisable under his Mrs. Doubtfire-ish face, Oldman acts out SO many emotions of the great man. At first, he's grumpy and a little rude, but then, as we get to see deeper into the character, he becomes very emotional and tender and totally inspiring. He is also a titan in politics; while everyone is pushing for surrender he continues the hard fight for victory with little cooperation from his fellow MPs and sees Hitler for what he really is/was. Oldman plays a hard man too, but a man who needed to be tough in such an uncertain world. All of these emotions are brilliantly and authentically portrayed by Oldman. He dazzles in this role, totally different to what he's used to (with LEON or THE FIFTH ELEMENT) as the old battle-axe that was Winston S. Churchill. Oldman says so much with his facial expressions that portray such emotion and sometimes pain. The only thing that didn't fit was the voice. Oldman didn't get the voice (but then again not many can) but he still gave it his best go. However, the most important thing was that he captured all of Churchill's mannerisms and characteristics. He is a VERY powerful actor and this was definitely Oldman's 'finest hour'.The rest of the cast is totally stellar as well, with the likes of Kristin Scott Thomas, Lilly James and Ben Mendeleshon. All of them perform to the uttermost of their ability and bring depth and conviction to their roles. This outstanding cast carries the film and you really enjoy watching ALL of them.This film really delivered with it's brilliant cast and engaging pace and showed so many sides of the great man that we rarely saw. Who thinks Gary Oldman well and truly deserved the Bafta? EVERYONE!",9,0,3,23 February 2018
The Irishman," 'Three And A Half Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back!'
","I can probably sum this film up in about three words: overlong, grim and boring.My family will tell you I'm a big Scorsese fan (Goodfellas is one of my absolute favourites!) but I was really disappointed by his latest directive outing. The genius behind Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The King Of Comedy (to name a few) has presented us with a monotonous slug of a film: The Irishman.I got a big kick out of seeing my acting heroes (DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel...) doing what they're best at doing and the attention to set detail was spot on (as always with Scorsese) but apart from that, I found little to like about The Irishman.The CGI was passable; I didn't think it was great but I didn't think it was terrible. The main problem (for me) was that DeNiro is trying to sound like 30-year old with the voice of a nearly 80-year old.As someone who's read Charles Brandt's I Heard You Paint Houses (the book that the film is based on), I was really struck by how much story Scorsese and Zaillian left out of the script and film. Almost all of Frank Sheeran's young life is glossed-over and people who don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was will be left almost none the wiser. If you really want to know who Jimmy Hoffa was and want to see a film about him that is both gripping and moving, I'd recommend Dany DeVito's Hoffa (1992). The film is not only shorter (by a whole hour and a half) but holds a cast that actually resembles the real people they're based on. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with The Irishman's cast but Al Pacino resembles none of Hoffa's characteristics or mannerisms. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is a virtual carbon copy of Hoffa's restless, volatile nature and squat, bulldog features.If this film were a piece of music, it would be a funeral dirge. The usual excitement of a Scorsese narrative is replaced with a prosaic confession spread-out over three and a half hours. It's not soulful or meaningful but dry and barren of any emotion. Maybe that's what Scorsese intended but when I sit down for a three hour film, I intend to be moved and gripped. The Irishman did neither. My advice? Watch Hoffa instead!But what do I know? 'I'm an average nobody, get to live the rest of my life like a schnook'.",7,3,5,5 January 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An Incredibly Powerful Movie!
","I REALLY have to say how this film just hit the ball straight out of the park! THREE BILLBOARDS is one of the most powerful and thought-provoking films I've seen in a long time. Director Martin McDonagh has delivered an incredibly raw and real movie. His directing and writing are both frankly awesome! He directs an absolutely brilliant cast but also writes an amazing script. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a masterpiece in dramatic writing. It's a very talky script, almost like something from the Cohen Brothers but carries real emotional weight and grit. There is room and backstory for every single character and the film becomes perfectly fleshed-out. Obviously, this was a film about a mother's search for justice but it was more about grief and how people deal with loss, it's also a powerful reminder that there are thousands of stories just like this and (I think) urges that we take care of eachother. The film was about as raw and real as you can get, in a disturbing and quite depressive way. It's no walk in the park, but the way in which the story is told is just SO powerful and moving. The plot is simple, but keeps an even pace and DOES grip. You get a perfect look at each character and how they feel and think. This however, is totally in debt to the jewel of a cast and I have chosen the three main standouts: Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. Frances McDormand gives an absolutely titanic performance as the film's tortured heroine Mildred. She is beyond convincing and is totally authentic. McDormand plays a woman TOTALLY consumed by grief, and who (quite understandably) cannot see past her quest for justice that has taken over her entire life. It's a very emotional performance with McDormand TOTALLY giving it her all. It's the way she delivers her lines but also her facial expressions that make the performance SO alive and vivid. Without a doubt, she has earned both her Bafta and her Oscar. Sam Rockwell delivers a truly epic performance as well as the racist Officer Dixon. He begins as a moronic bully, who you actually grow to really loathe. Someone, who totally abuses their position in society and becomes more of an armed thug than a officer of the law. However, after several events he undergoes a drastic character change and becomes soft-spoken, more caring and you actually grow to really like him. Rockwell is extremely convincing as he portrays all of these emotions and gives a really strong performance. Woody Harrelson is another strong, but frankly heartbreaking performance in this film as Chief Willoughby, a man suffering with terminal cancer. Harrelson definitely gives one of his best performances as Willoughby. He says it all with looks, showing real pain and sadness and becomes a character that we really care about.Both the acting and script move the film along to it's ending. The ending is curious and rather inconclusive but when I left the cinema, I thought that it HAD actually ended where it should have. Obviously, people will compare the main Oscar movies and say which is better, in this case: THE SHAPE OF WATER VS THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI. Here's my opinion, the superior film is without a doubt THREE BILLBOARDS. The performances and plot is just on another level, but I HAVE to say that in terms of enjoyment, SHAPE OF WATER wins for me, primarily because, though I REALLY admired this film, it did leave me a little depressed and with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth due to the brutally tragic plot. However, this film is incredibly powerful and has really earned it's nominations and wins. I don't watch or like horror but this is the film that should have been called MOTHER!",9,1,3,14 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," So, I finally watched The Rise of Skywalker last night...
","And...I LOVED it!I NEVER thought I would, but I did. This was a really gripping, decent Star Wars movie and it gets about as close to recapturing the magic of the originals as Disney is ever going to get. The pace of the film is perfect and the new characters were all really compelling. The tales of redemption and belonging blend together beautifully and aside from the odd plot-hole and unnecessary kiss, things fitted together perfectly. Unlike the abominable Last Jedi, things didn't feel convoluted and I was never really bored. I was skeptical about the prospect of Luke returning as a force ghost but the X-Wing lift scene was magical! Overall, a really decent movie that gripped and thrilled me. As to the global criticism, all I can say is that Jeremy Jahns and the Honest Trailer group must have been watching a different movie.",8,7,23,5 May 2020
Baby Driver," Action-packed, Cool, Funny & Totally Brilliant!
","Whatever the plot, whether it's a zombie or robot invasion, a action-comedy cop spoof, or a crime drama about a getaway driver called BABY. One thing's for sure, since it's Edgar Wright, it's gonna be a fun ride (pardon puns!) and with BABY DRIVER, it certainly is a both fun and brilliant ride! BABY DRIVER is quite simply one of the best films I've seen in 2017 if not the best! It's gripping, exciting, romantic and really FUN. In my opinion it's Wright's best work, period. Everything about it is pure genius: the script, the plot, the scenes, the characters, the action and of course the soundtrack! Baby Driver does owes some of its greatness to it's killer sound track which really kicks the film on wards and combined with the amazing script, creates scenes which are a little similar to something out of La la Land (only with more guns and shooting). I would've liked some Bowie or Hendrix but that's just me! Like I've said, the script is AMAZING and transforms the film not into your average heist movie but into a much cooler animal! It's a romance, comedy, musical (only without singing, but dancing instead) and, it's a thriller too! There was serious tension in this movie and I was gripped from the beginning and held at the edge of my seat! Wright really excels with this movie in both his writing and directing. Each scene is laced with killer dialogue, often brilliant music and great performances too! It's a heist thriller like no other and was a real joy to watch. Wright directs such a BRILLIANT cast too and combined with the story and script I ended up hooked but also REALLY caring about the characters. The cast in this film is on FIRE and every single member is on top-form! The two main leads, Elgort and James are simply wonderful to watch and share REAL screen chemistry! Their musical romance is simply enchanting to watch. Elgort is Baby and he delivers a strong, authentic and really enjoyable performance. He cares so much for Deborah (James) and his Foster-Father and is the typical lovable rogue who wants to get out of 'the game' but is too far in. He drives like a legend and dances like Ryan Gosling (only better!). Lilly James is the movie's heroine Deborah and before I saw this movie, I was NOT a Lilly James fan, but after her first few minutes on screen, I have to admit that I was smitten. She's adorably charismatic, authentic and yes, sexy. She plays a sort of Juliet but more tough and is really a heroine that you can fall in love with. The rest of the cast really delivers too. The great Jon Hamm delivers a brilliant, strong and charismatic performance as Buddy but his character's certainly no Don Draper. His gangster wife (Darling), Eliza González also delivers a charismatic performance and her and Hamm share a dark and passionate chemistry as well. Jamie Foxx as always delivers a VERY charismatic performance as the violent thug Bats and is another gripping presence in this movie. Finally, Kevin Spacey reminds us that he is still a very fine actor and delivers a very strong performance as the brains behind the operation: Doc. He plays someone who is a hard criminal mastermind but he also has a softer side and cares for Baby almost like a son or nephew. All of these FANTASTIC factors push the film along it's tense and exciting path to the finale and I must say I LOVE the way Wright pulls it all together. He ties up all the loose ends and at the end you feel happy and satisfied and feels like the film has ended perfectly. I REALLY LOVED this movie and would seriously recommend to anyone. Wright has once again shown us that he is a very fine director and can make a darn good movie!",10,0,4,24 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," 3/4 'Meh', 1/4 'Woah!!!'
","I wasn't that keen on ENDGAME, there... I said it. I went into this film with high expectations (thanks to all the hype/money it's made/phenomenon that was INFINITY WAR) and was rather let down. There were two real problems with this movie: 1) it's WAY too long and subsequently becomes rather unfocused on reaching it's conclusion. 2) it is just plain BORING for it's opening 2 hours and a half! There's no material that grips me/makes me say 'wow', unlike INFINITY WAR which blew my socks off within the first 10 minutes.There are several plot lines that are both uninteresting and unnecessary. I'm all up for character-building, but do we need much more character-building after 15 WHOLE MOVIES, and does it really have to take up 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF SCREEN TIME?!! I don't mind a film needing a build-up but this was quite frankly RIDICULOUS, especially when (despite being 2 hours and 40 minutes) INFINITY WAR cut to the chase pretty quickly while still making us feel for the characters.However, to say that ENDGAME was a total loss would be untrue. The final quarter/ending of the movie will leave you awestruck and sad! It's a brilliant ending that fires on all four cylinders, so it's just a shame that the rest of the movie had to be so tedious/unnecessarily stretched-out!",7,1,4,15 May 2019
Batman Begins," Dark, gripping, and highly enjoyable!
","After the unspeakable things Joel Schumacher did to Batman in the 90s, audiences were looking for a more realistic and gripping Batman and here, I think, they truly found that! BATMAN BEGINS is a whole new ball game for the super hero genre. Like the opera that the Wayne family watches at the start of the movie: Batman Begins is dark, brooding and gripping. However, this is definitely a SUPER HERO Origin story, and Batman Begins doesn't shy away from the slightly unrealistic side of the super hero genre, but it keeps it realistic enough so that you don't get bored or think the action is ridiculously naff (unlike Kingsman 2). Nolan directs superbly and really pulls together a formidable film with Bob Kane and David S. Goyer delivering a gripping and very entertaining script. It takes Batman to places you really don't expect: a Burmese prison, a secret Ninja school in the snowy mountains and it even has Batman contemplating murdering his parents killer... However, it has a couple of small issues, sometimes, the script can feel a little lagging, sometimes the action can feel a little far-fetched and Tom Wilkinson is not someone I would choose as Carmine Falcone. Seriously, there are times where he just READS the script off the page. But, these are little things in a very strong and enjoyable movie. As well as directing gripping action scenes and stunning cinematography, Nolan really directs a killer cast that are ALL (but Wilkinson) on top form... Christian Bale delivers a strong, authentic and charismatic performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He plays both egos of the character with real passion and flare. Batman's voice is SPOT-ON! The rest of the ALL-STAR cast really delivers as well.Katie Holmes (the heroine) is enjoyable as Rachel but her scenes with Bruce can feel a little predictable in their dialogue and the end of their relationship is a bit of a Romance cliché, with her dumping him weirdly because of him becoming a better person, but over all she's a heroine you really grow fond of. Liam Neeson is also enjoyable if not a little stale as Ducard but still gives us a very entertaining performance as the movie's main villain.The other villain rights must of course go to Cillian Murphy's Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA Scarecrow! He, like Heath Ledger in the second movie (The Dark Knight) delivers a brilliant and deeply phsycological performance and plays the part with real zest and fire!Other enjoyable performances come from actors such as Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer and even Ken Watanabe. Sir Michael really delivers a both funny and authentic performance as Alfred Pennyworth, and is really a joy to watch. For Ken Watanabe fans, Watanabe's performance is more of a long cameo, but even HE is on top form and delivers a strong performance. Another, great performance is the great Gary Oldman as Officer Jim Gordon. I was a little shocked and amused to see the man who was one of the NASTIEST villains in movie history (LEON) playing a good guy, but he (like the rest of the cast), delivers a strong performance. All these GOOD factors: directing, script, action scenes, actors and cinematography create a really strong and enjoyable film but the film is also kept going by the brilliant soundtrack, composed by the great Hans Zimmer. Zimmer's score is SPOT-ON with the film: dark and brooding but also heroic. The film really creates the Batman myth that we know and love with him gliding through the sky like a Bat out of (forgive the pun)... The film does have tension, but for REAL tension I'd look to the sequel, for, as I've said this film is a SUPER HERO movie and is sometimes unrealistic, whereas, The Dark Knight is more: a deeply realistic crime thriller than SUPER HERO flick. However, this is still a both enjoyable and gripping movie, what you want from a Batman movie!",8,0,0,27 September 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," A Complete Blast For MARVEL Fans!
","Even though it's not perfect, I must say that AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR totally delivers all you want from a MARVEL movie. It gives you: the characters you love, the villain you've been waiting for and, of course the action sequences you've been craving like a fist-shaped bar of MARVEL-brand chocolate! We ALL should know by now that Joel and Anthony Russo+ MARVEL MCU= greatness and INFINITY WAR proves that fact yet again! Overall it's a pretty cool and fun ride, but you certainly have to prepare yourself for typical superhero silliness. However, the silly superhero stuff is told in a mature, non-patronising way and it wasn't like the rest of the of the frankly 'daft' superhero films of the past year. Yes, I'm talking about you, THOR: RAGNAROK, SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, BLACK PANTHER and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2. Though INFINITY WAR is certainly NOT realistic at all, it grips and has a serious tone that keeps you watching. The script is dynamic but also very funny in some parts and we get a good look at MOST of the characters. The plot is simple and nothing THAT new or fresh but it still grips and provides real closure on the already rather over-bloated MARVEL cinematic universe. There were a couple of elements I wasn't QUITE sure on but more about them later. Firstly, the good things: the plot, the characters and action.The plot for the most part was really exciting and really had me gripped; it was serious and tense. However, it WAS a little dull in some parts. There were a few times when things lagged for a while but on a whole I was never really bored during this film. The main thing I was concerned about in this film was the amount of additional characters and how the film could easily become convoluted. Here's the thing: it didn't feel convoluted BUT, some of the characters do get sidelined. Some of your favourites like Captain America, Black Widow and Black Panther were kind of pushed out into the background and though they featured, they didn't feature as much as some (and me) would have liked. The story really focuses on three sectors: Thanos, Team Iron Man and Team Guardians. Everything else is really not that major. Now, on to the action. The action in this film was quite frankly AWESOME! After all, these are the directors behind the elevator and airport fight scenes in the Captain America films 2 and 3. The battle for Wakanda plays out like a completely OTT version of the battle of the Pelennor Fields from LOTR 3 and once the infamous AVENGERS score kicks in, you know you've got a good thing going! Now, on to the acting! Almost ALL the members of the cast are great and give it their all! Some of these characters may not get all that much to say but they're all well-acted. However, I REALLY wasn't sure about the movie's main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin). I must admit I found Thanos (as a character) rather bland. You certainly realise what a threat he poses to the Avengers but really, he's a purple Darth Vader who's not THAT interesting. Brolin's performance is strong as the genocidal maniac but there were times when Brolin simply read the script. Though the villain is something new, I don't see him as a cinematic villain that will stand out!On a whole, the film was fun, action-packed and gripping but it's nothing REALLY new and as my Dad so rightly said: 'once you've seen one; you've seen them all!' The conclusion was devastating and raised many, many questions and the after-credits scene was certainly interesting even though it wasn't really worth waiting for. Definitely a fun ride but I couldn't really say that 'this... Does bring a smile to my face'...",8,1,3,27 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 'We Happy? We Happy!'
","For me, this film was another La La Land; the first time I saw it, I didn't like it. However, after going away and thinking about it and eventually returning to it, I thought (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) was really quite good.I wouldn't say that it's Tarantino's best film but I would say that it's possibly 2019's best. The dialogue is simple but hits all the right notes. The stellar cast is, well... 'stellar'. Brad Pitt was the definition of 'cool' while Margot Robbie managed to capture all of the silent tragedy of the life of Sharon Tate. Even the dog (Brandy) was on top, hippy-chewing form!Personally, I think you've just got to know what you're going in for. This isn't some complex movie trying to tell some spiritual message. This is a story about two fellas going from A to B. It becomes more complicated when you wonder why Tarantino decided to add the Manson element, and I can only conclude that (like my father, who was 18 at the time) he was very affected by them when they happened. Apart from that, this film is very, very simple. Is that a bad thing? In the end, no. Films are often so convoluted these days, so it was nice to see a film that knew what it wanted to achieve and achieved it.Should it have one Best Picture? Yes. No other film this year has entertained me like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I was very disappointed with The Irishman and thought Joker was both grim and unoriginal. I know there are others but for me, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood really stood out for its creativity and its visual poetry. After watching it, you sit back and think: 'why couldn't history have been like that?'In short, it's a movie made by someone who loves movies and if you want a nostalgic, heartfelt look at the bygone days of 1960s Hollywood, this film is for you!",8,2,3,6 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Disappointing Next Step For The Franchise!
","'This is not going to go the way you think', too right! A lot of people including Youtube's SCREEN JUNKIES have claimed that this is the worst STAR WARS movie to date. I don't think it's the worst, but I certainly don't think it's the best. In the first half I was quite frankly bored, and by the beginning of the second half I had already diagnosed several, big problems: 1) The clunky script had abandoned the emotional weight and grit of the previous movies. 2) There are FAR too many sub-plots and additional characters. 3) It's just too predictable and 4) the whole plot is quite frankly just a rehash of both THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI. Don't believe me? Here we go: a young Jedi abandons the cause of the Rebellion to travel to a desolate homestead to learn how to become a Jedi from a cranky but father-like teacher, 'it's a trap' as bad guys close in on the rebels once again, half the gang is betrayed by a conman who they thought was their friend, the young Jedi has a dream where they see a shady figure that turns out to have the same face, the rebels prepare for battle with AT-ATs while sitting in a trench in a primarily white landscape, the 50% bad guy kills his evil overlord, the old Jedi master passes away and finally, a Yoda ghost appears. Sound familiar?Let's break down the problems: first of all, the script in this film was frankly robotic and really let down the characters. It was basic, boring and rather childish. Such a shame when you've got such a talented cast of both old and newcomers. For example, Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux. Gleeson in my opinion is a fine actor but he was quite frankly awful in this film, completely stiff. Unfortunately, Gleeson wasn't the only poor performance in this movie. I was, however, touched to see Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher reprising their iconic roles in this film, even though I couldn't help feeling sad at seeing Carrie Fisher's swan song. However, apart from these two, because of the script, the cast was a big let-down. Now, secondly, there were just too many sub-plots and additional characters. THE FORCE AWAKENS had many characters but was more focused and balanced in showcasing all of them. THE LAST JEDI on the other hand didn't manage to pull it off and the film felt both convoluted, and over-complicated. It tried to tell so many individual stories when it should have just focused on a maximum of 3 and left it at that. Thirdly, the film was predictable to the extent where I could actually see what was coming up next. The twists are sometimes fun, but you can still see them coming a long way off. Finally, as I've already said, the plot just ripped off EPISODE V and I actually found myself yelling at the TV because of how obvious and unoriginal it was. However, there was another problem, there were several twists that both didn't make sense and were completely unestablished: Leia surviving both an explosion and being able to fly through space to get to a Rebel ship AND, the way telepathic communication was used in this film. This film meant to sell us the idea that you can both see and experience the surroundings of the person (or Jedi) you're communicating with. This was NEVER established in any of the films. Also, it was never ever established that Leia had any supernatural or Jedi abilities ever, in the whole of the franchise, ever! Period. However, I must admit that the film got slightly better in the second half. The throne room fight was absolutely brilliant and delivered exactly what you want from a STAR WARS movie. I would definitely say that the second half was better than the first but overall the film felt unbalanced and didn't fit together well. The film also provided absolutely NO CLOSURE. Yes, they kill off a major franchise character and the evil overlord but since that overlord featured for about 5 minutes in the last movie, his end (and even his presence) felt pointless. This is pointlessly prolonging a story on ARROW (the series) proportions and just frustrated me further.There were enjoyable elements to this film but overall it was a disappointing affair that did neither the franchise nor the characters any real justice. Such a shame, let's hope SOLO will do one of the franchises' most beloved characters more justice than this film did it's source material...",6,4,7,11 April 2018
Logan," Brutal, tragic, but a fitting end...
","In the words of Shane, a movie that is both watched and quoted in this film: 'there's no living with... with a killing. There's no going back from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. There's no going back'. This sums up the feel and plot of LOGAN well, a film about someone who's done terrible things to survive and is now just trying to get by in peace... It's been 17 years of Hugh Jackman as one of the MCU's greatest characters and now his run has finally come to an end. Let's face it, apart from Jackman's Wolverine himself, it hasn't been a great ride. The past few X-Men films have been decidedly mediocre and the first WOLVERINE movie (Origins) was downright terrible, but I can assure you that LOGAN is a whole new ballgame for the Superhero movie. James Mangold has delivered the best X-Men film to date and this really feels momentous for the franchise. Although I admired and respected a lot of this film, there was also material that I frankly hated in it. Let's look at all the good in Logan!  Obviously a large portion of praise has to go to Director James Mangold for pulling it all together, and pull it all together he certainly has. Both his writing and directing are quite frankly masterful. Mangold's story encompasses all that you expect out of a Wolverine movie (it is after all based on the Old Man Logan comic book) but what Mangold does is he strips his characters and the story right down and makes it raw and realistic. The plot is simple and straightforward but has enough twists and turns to keep you hooked. The characters are all very strong and brilliantly multi-layered and the story itself is brooding and very Western-like. Mangold also directs brilliantly, choreographing brilliant and brutal action scenes but also getting 110% out of most of his cast and that's the real highlight of LOGAN: the cast!We must of course begin with Mr. Jackman. I am not a person who thinks Superhero movies deserve a place at the Oscars but with Jackman there has to be an exception and if he doesn't get at least a nomination for actor I will be very disappointed. Jackman delivers a herculean performance as Logan. He's a cynical, depressed, world-weary, alcoholic who is nowhere near the young punk we used to watch. His healing factor is failing him. He squeezes bullets out his chest and is forced to pull his claws straight out of his knuckles. Bloody coughing fits and claw puss is another affliction Logan suffers with. He actually wishes for death and Hugh Jackman plays all of that to the uttermost of his acting ability. Every cough, wheeze and splutter is authentic and real. We're made to feel his pain, anger, sadness and loss. It's an incredibly raw performance. He really captures the character of a regretful man who's had a violent life and now just wants to die in peace. He only lives with Professor X, Caliban and eventually his daughter Laura 'X-23'. But perhaps most importantly, through his performance, we are truly made to care about this old man, Logan.However, Logan is not the only good performance in this film. There are two other standouts: Laura (Dafne Keen) and Professor X (Sir Patrick Stewart). Dafne Keen delivers a phenomenal performance as Laura and at so young an age. She gives a incredibly strong performance and plays a real fighter. She's every bit as tough as her Dad but also has a very humane side that you can really root for. Not wanting to sound pompous but mark my words: 'that girl will go far' and I really look forward to seeing more of Ms. Keen and her growing career. Then there's Sir Patrick Stewart as the ailing Professor X. Here is another really vivid performance. The Professor is dementia-addled and forgetful. He acts as Logan's conscience but is often prone to devastating mental seizure's. He's definitely flawed but acts as Logan's father and becomes the sort of grandpa character that you really care about and just want to hug. Decent performances from most of the supporting cast including Stephen Merchant, Boyd Holbrook, Elizabeth Rodriguez and Jason Genao. Stephen Merchant gives a good, serious performance as the sarcastic mutant Caliban. Boyd Holbrook is convincing as the psychopathic thug Donald Pierce but is certainly no Hans Landa. Elizabeth Rodriguez gives a very emotional performance as the damsel in distress. Jason Genao is another great performance as the new mutant leader and gives a very strong performance. The only error in casting is Richard E. Grant as Dr. Zander Rice. Grant is not someone I would even think of casting for Rice and basically reads the script but this is a small blight on a terrific cast.Something that obviously stood out in this film is the action, really courtesy of the R-rating. The rating really gave Mangold the free reigns to give us action appropriate for such characters. We really see what Logan and Laura's claws are capable of. I first watched this film with my very good friend and fellow IMDB user Tarx309 and we were really both taken aback by the action. It's gritty, bloody and brutal but most of all realistic and so makes it more believable. Each fight scene is brilliant and brutal. Logan's berserker run against the Reavers in the forest at the end is simply glorious to see, with Logan unleashing all his rage and fury! Finally, did I enjoy LOGAN? I enjoyed LOGAN as much as it was impossible to enjoy it. There were funny moments but they were few and far between. There were tender moments but they were crushed by the brutality, but I must say I was really touched to see the old western SHANE since it's a movie I often watch with my Dad. However, the second act was what really ruined the film for me. A gorgeous Christian family is brutally murdered. You see I can take violence but what I can't stand is mindless slaughter. It ruined LEON for me and it ruined part of this too. It was like something out of your worst nightmare and really dragged the film down for me. Once it gets back on the brutal adventure path I enjoy it but it was still a horrible path for the film to take. We finally arrive at the climatic and bloody end of the movie and without giving anything away, it will break your heart!...LOGAN is certainly not for the squeamish but it is a masterpiece of the MCU and a fitting end to 17 good years of the Jackman in his famous role. It's a sad, dark, brutal chapter but certainly the best end to the character. Farewell, Bub!",9,1,3,27 January 2018
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Magnum Opus!
","Genius! Pure genius, is what this film is! Though INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED and JACKIE BROWN are among my favourite QT movies, none of Tarantino's other work is quite as much fun, as inventive or as darn quotable as PULP FICTION! It's a true 'cult movie' of the highest order, and a true, movie, gem from the 90s!Never has Tarantino's dialogue been so juicy, his story so much fun or his characters so iconic (apart from Mr. Blonde or Hans Landa, of course!). There's just so much to enjoy from this movie as Tarantino pulls together one his best casts including Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman and unforgettably, Samuel L. Jackson! Tarantino also crafts one of the best soudntracks in cinematic history; using some of the greats like Al Green, Dusty Springfield, and Chuck Berry's 'You Never Can Tell' in the so-bad-that-it's-good dance sequence (which I intend to dance with my future wife at our wedding someday)!Every scene is laced with killer, totally quotable dialogue and who here, isn't aware by now, that a Quater Pounder with Cheese in France, is called 'Royale With Cheese'? It's probably (save INGLOURIOUS and DJANGO) Tarantino's best script, with the dynamite dialogue and brilliant, yet baffling use of the non-linnear storyline. Never have Tarantino's storylines ever captured the imagination in such an explosive way as we follow two hit men, a mobster's wife, a boxer and a pair of diner-robbing, adrenaline junkies!I'm not saying it's perfect; there's stuff you'll hate, there's stuff that will shock you and there's stuff that will disgust you as the film deals with the illegal, criminal, underworld of Los Angeles. As iconic as it was, being a Christian, I was not entirely comfourtable with Tarantino's version of the Bible verse from Ezekiel but on a whole, I found myself moved by Jules Winnfield's (Samuel L. Jackson's) tale of redemption as the hitman who has a dramatic change of heart since it shows that even a hired killer, is not without soul or humanity.Like I said, this film is about crime but the real crime is that Samuel L. Jackson didn't get an Oscar for his role! He is frankly masterful as he lyrically waxes about burgers, pigs and moral codes. He's BY FAR, the best part of the film and is able to appear comical and terrifying at the same time.Every factor of this film fits together perfectly and to paraphrase from INGLOURIOUS: 'I Think This Just Might Be Tarantino's Masterpiece!'",9,1,2,25 December 2018
The Shape of Water," One Of The Best Of 2018!
","To paraphrase one of this film's quotes: 'If I told you about THE FILM what would I say?' It's beautiful, enchanting, moving, gripping but it's also strange and quite odd, like some brilliantly bizarre poem. However, the really great thing about THE SHAPE OF WATER, as well as the acting and script is how fresh and new it is. It REALLY IS something you don't see everyday. The concept, story and delivery really dazzle. The scope is awe-inspiring and this film has certainly earned it's Oscar in my opinion. Director Guillermo Del Toro has TOTALLY delivered with this movie in both his writing and directing. The script is genius frankly, smart, sharp and very original (whatever some say). We get a deep and emotional look at each character and each story. Though the film is obviously about Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her romance with the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones), this film has many backstories and additional plot lines, and the film becomes brilliantly and complexly multi-layered. Del Toro directs brilliantly too, getting the uttermost from his stellar cast, but also grafting a brilliant and authentic 60s world. GREEN is something that features almost everywhere: the walls, the floor, the water, the food, and of course the Amphibian Man himself. The visual effects in this film are pretty much second-to-none (except BLADE RUNNER 2049) and the animated Amphibian Man is beautiful and vibrant, like a great painting. Now, onto the story. The plot is simple and uncomplicated but still grips and makes you feel for the characters. It is also authentic to the attitudes and paranoia of the times with racism, homophobia, sexism and the 'Red Scare', all portrayed unapologetically. However, the main event of course is Elisa and her peculiarly amorous relationship with the Amphibian Man. Many people have said that the film's concept is rather creepy and weird and I must admit I was a little skeptical about the spectacle of a woman falling in (and making) love to a fish man, but the romance is told in such a beautiful and graceful way that you end up not minding at all. I WAS, however, rather glad that their love life was not explored too graphically. Almost as soon the two met I was rooting for them. I felt pity for Amphibian Man and the brutal way in which he was treated but I also fell in love with Elisa 'the princess without voice'. The only problem was, (and call me a cynic) I didn't get the emotional connection from their romance that I would get from that of a man and a woman. I DID care about their romance but it wasn't the same as the romance between human people. I should warn that this film is bloodily violent at times and may shock, it's certainly not some kid's fairy tale... However, the whole story was of course carried by the cast and I have (as usual) chosen a few standouts (4 to be precise): Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins. Hawkins was BRILLIANT! Totally different to what we know her for (PADDINGTON anyone?) as Elisa, the mute heroine. Hawkins gives such a convincing and strong performance and though her character can't speak, we still know exactly what she's thinking. Hawkins facial expressions are portraits of pain, sorrow, joy and raw emotion and Elisa becomes a heroine you can TOTALLY fall in love with. Richard Jenkins is also brilliant as Giles, a repressed homosexual and a real father figure to Elisa. He's emotional, a little vain but charming and Jenkins character is one you can really grow fond of. Octavia Spencer certainly earns her Bafta as Elisa's friend and confidant Zelda. She's a strong, independent woman, putting on a brave face for all the racism she suffers, but she has a very emotional centre and Spencer really does the character justice. Michael Shannon is monstrously magnificent as Mr. Strickland. Unfeeling and uncaring, he's a brutal villain you grow to hate as he brutalises the creature and terrifies other characters, driven with a powerhouse performance by Shannon.The charming vintage soundtrack and gorgeous dream sequences along with all of the above, REALLY moved the film along to it's tense ending. Del Toro ties it up beautifully, like a classic fairytale romance with a twist. As always, I ask myself, did I enjoy it? Yes! I really did enjoy THE SHAPE OF WATER. The cast was outstanding, the story was brilliantly strange and fresh, but most of all the film delivered and really deserves it's Oscar (and even my Dad enjoyed it)...",8,31,56,7 March 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Certainly not brilliant but still rather enjoyable!
","I must admit, after his first directorial debuts with the appalling THOR movies, I was a little hesitant about Kenneth Branagh's latest outing as director (and star) with Murder on the Orient Express, and though there was a fair amount of material to enjoy, I'm sad to say that I WAS fairly spot-on. Don't get me wrong, there IS enjoyable stuff here but there were also various problems that left me rather disappointed. Let's first focus on the good things. First of all, one thing Branagh REALLY does well in this movie with his directing, is he delivers a brilliant and authentic slice of nostalgia. We begin in 1930s Jerusalem and Branagh captures the spirit and style of that period spot-on. The fashion, the clothes, the cars, the expensive clubs and bars. We see beautiful shots of Istanbul too with the glorious steamboats and the incredible Cathedrals. We're really transported back in time, but the other way Branagh delivers that nostalgia is with the absolutely breathtaking natural scenery that revolves around the Orient Express's journey. The cinematography in this film is BRILLIANT, courtesy of Haris Zambarloukos and really flies us into the snowy mountains or across the sun- kissed plains. The journey of the train is REALLY beautifully shown all the way through the film. Another good thing that Branagh captures is the attitudes and politics of the period. He's changed the British Colonel Arbuthnot into an African Dr. Arbuthnot, but this change from the original text is actually really interesting and adds another level to the story. A lot of the characters suffer from period racism, and that is authentically portrayed VERY well. Another thing is the set design, the interior of the train. It's beautiful, classic and very stylish. Also, another obvious thing to mention about Branagh's directing is that he does pull together a formidable cast. Almost every member is on top form. The whole line-up from Pfeiffer to Dafoe is great. Pfeiffer delivers a very emotional and strong performance as Mrs. Hubbard. Daisy Ridley plays a posh heroine and she plays that authentically too. Leslie Odom Jr. isn't bad as Dr. Arbuthnot but his muddled accent IS a distraction. Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman are two other interesting and authentic performances as the Russian Princess and German maid. Penelope Cruz delivers a interesting and surprising performance is Pilar Estravados. The great Willem Dafoe delivers enjoyable authenticity and some charm as the Nazi Professor. Derek Jacobi and Manuel Garcia- Rulfo deliver two very enjoyable performances. Jacobi harnessing his inner Alfred Pennyworth and Rulfo ringing with charisma... I am however, rather divide on Johnny Depp's sinister businessman Ratchett. He DOES play a thug well but there are STILL ghosts of Captain Jack and he can be a little laughable at times. Now we've gone through the GOOD members of the cast, onto the bad. Four performances stand out as REALLY poor. Josh Gad, Lucy Boynton, Sergei Polunin and Tom Bateman as the assistant, Count, Countess and train manager. They ALL deliver poor and rather weak performances with Gad, Polunin and Bateman all trying vainly to portray real emotion and Boynton basically playing a female Jack Sparrow. I've saved Branagh's performance for last. I was incredibly divided on his performance as Hercules Poirot which is a combo of Sherlock Holmes and Howard Hughes from THE AVIATOR . He DID deliver emotion and authenticity but there were times when his raving about the 'crime' and the 'truth' did feel a bit over-dramatic. His accent wasn't bad but I (personally) think that David Suchet did the best accent. Also, as many have mentioned, his mustache is simply not Poirot, it's more of a John Ruth from the Hateful Eight in my opinion! Now, the script. It, like the film has both good AND bad points. The dialogue is usually smart, sharp and interesting. It displays Poirot's genius and the personalities of the passengers very well. It really showcases the nostalgia of the times VERY well and slightly hinges on the 1974 film of the same name, but it also really grafts the tragedy and horror of the fictional 'Armstrong Case' very well too. However, this version does have slight changes in plot to the original novel by Christie. There are various twists and turns that are interesting but, VERY messy. Things could do to be tightened up a lot in this film. Also, it just isn't exciting and it didn't really grab me at all. There is almost no dramatic atmosphere or tension. However, all the good performances, great cinematography and interesting dialogue DID deliver a fairly enjoyable picture. But, as I have listed, it does have problems! Not bad but definitely a B-PICTURE!",7,9,25,6 November 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," A Moving, Cinematic Classic!
","The first thing that really struck me after watching Frank Darabondt's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was how much it resembled parts of the plot, but most of all the feel of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. What is THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really about? Yes, it's about a hellish prison, it's about how corruptible some human beings can be, it's about the good and the bad and the ugly of humanity, it's about depression, it's about yearning for belonging, it's about hope but most of all (like of MICE AND MEN), it's about one, truly glorious friendship. I do (of course) refer to the brilliant and heartwarming bromance shared by one Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and one Red (Morgan Freeman). It's their tale of friendship and sacrifice that takes place in the living hell that is Shawshank prison and their brutally honest story is brought, magnificently to the screen by Frank Darabondt. Every, single, vital element of this film is done to cinematic perfection: the writing, the directing, the cinematography, the scoring and of course the acting. All these elements are executed perfectly and the story is told with poignant, brutal, raw honesty. It makes you immediately stop and think about the days when 'prison' meant prison and how if you went down, you were as a good as dead. We see this by the horrendous cruelty that Andy experiences at the hands of the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), the vile, rapist inmate Bogs (Mark Rolston) and finally, by the black hearted and truly evil, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). We see men, in short, treated and brutalised like animals. We see men suffering from utter hopelessness and depression but still trying to build a life around their grieving situation. However, we also see the lighter side of things and this is where the film is most moving; we see people making a working environment in prison and how they carry hope with them (some, more than others) and try their best to live a productive life in a harsh environment. Darabondt brings this to life epically; he directs perfectly, getting the uttermost from his cast and pulling everything together marvellously, he writes powerfully, breathing real life to each character and clearly marking out the heroes and villains. He makes you feel about each and every character and you end up truly caring about their hopes and dreams for the future. Like I said, this film (I believe) owes much to OF MICE AND MEN and as we focus on Andy and Red, (I think) you can appreciate how much they both resemble George and Lenny. They care and love each other almost like brothers and share a wonderful dream of someday escaping their current hell and living the dream. Sound familiar? He is a truly talented writer and with the script, as well as being able to make you shocked, horrified and sad, he can also make you laugh, make you happy and make you charmed as you behold the lighter side to the life in Shawshank. In short, Darabondt pulls together a truly marvellous piece of cinema that captures the inner turmoil and quest for hope and peace of the human spirit.However, Darabondt's brilliant directing is not the only great thing about the film. The cinematography in this film was simply breathtaking, courtesy of the great Roger Deakins. I always love the poetic way in which Deakins tells a story with the camera. It feels poetic and mystical: the way in which the camera flies over the prison inmates, Andy in the sewage pipe, Andy in the rain and the beaches around the Atlantic Ocean. Wether it's BLADE RUNNER 2049 or SICARIO, Deakins captures the spirit of every story he films perfectly and is a true artist with the film camera. Another great thing about the film is the score, courtesy of Thomas Newman. It builds throughout the film with a combination of soft piano and strings. His composing is filled with such poignant emotion and poetry and it really struck me how much this score resembled his work for Sam Mendes's 2002 thriller ROAD TO PERDITION. In both films, the score lifts each scene and makes the film powerful and poignant. 
 
Finally, the true brilliance of the film (or, when you think about it, any film) lies with its cast. The cast for this film was truly magnificent with some of the 20th centuries finest actors giving it their 110%! The main standouts are (without a doubt) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins is powerfully poignant and moving as the movie's wronged hero. He steals every scene as his face paints pictures of sorrow, regret, depression and gentle optimism. He makes you feel so much for the character and you almost feel as if you're going through life in Shawshank with him. Put it this way: his performance in this film couldn't be further from his performance in something like THE HUDSUCKER PROXY! Morgan Freeman was also frankly masterful in this film as he shows what a truly talented actor he is. His portrayal of a worn-out but kindhearted individual is heartwarming and sincere but also his methodical, poetic, poignant, and now famous narration is truly marvellous. The story is really lifted with his virtual fairytale narration and to quote from TED 2 (as said to Freeman) 'I could go to sleep on a bed made of your voice!' Everyone else in the film is marvellous so its hard to pick who else deserves a mention, but I think you definitely have to mention Shawshank's vile Warden Norton, played by Bob Gunton. At first, he pretends to be a firm but fair teacher with good, pure values, but as the film progresses, you see that his heart is as black as the some of the prisoners he keeps. He's ruthlessly ambitious and hides behind the facade of protector. He's truly as 'boo and hiss' sort of villain and Gunton plays the character perfectly! All these wonderful factors carried the film along to its shocking but wonderful conclusion. I won't spoil if you haven't seen it but I will say that the film truly ends, perfectly! THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION captures what many films have tried to and failed: the human nature! I've seen very few films that capture the human nature in such a raw and uncompromising way. It's a truly masterful piece of cinema and probably the best 'prison movie' since COOL HAND LUKE...",9,1,1,15 September 2018
Wonder Woman," Certainly not without blemishes, but STILL, Very Good!
","One thing's for sure: there's A LOT to like here! Let's face it: DC hasn't had good movies in the past few years! BATMAN V SUPERMAN, GREEN LANTERN and GREEN HORNET, but WONDER WOMAN, is up there with the likes of BATMAN BEGINS! It's like a much better version of CAPTAIN America 1 and there are quite a few similarities! The story doesn't lag and keeps a strong and even pace, starting on the shores of Themyscira and continuing to London, 'The Frontlines' and German-occupied France! The time spent in Themyscira is pleasant enough with an absolutely adorable, young Princess Diana (Lilly Aspell) but it gets a little uncomfortable to watch when the likes of Robin Wright ('Jennie!') and Connie Nielsen practice for war in their skimpy, leather war Armour as General Antiope and Queen Hippolyta. However this slightly unrealistic element does not matter since the story is pushed on by the arrival of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and the German army. From then on it's a real joy-ride! By this point in the film we have the REAL Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot and she shines as Diana! Not in a creepy way but, she's gorgeous! Her character's so optimistic and naive to the outside world. She hasn't even met the rest of the world but she still wants to help them and Gadot plays all these characteristics SUPERBLY! The film is kept going with the killer cast BUT, also with the script and the directing. Allan Heinberg delivers a very well-written script. EVERY single character has back story that makes you really root for them. But the script makes this a film of many genres: it's a war movie, it's a romance, it's a comedy and yes, of course, it's a sci-fi! Patty Jenkins REALLY does direct well and gets the best from her cast. Gadot is brilliant but not just her, Pine is as ALWAYS, ringing with charismatic charm and enthusiasm and his valiant war hero is a joy to spend time with. Everyone else is on top form too! Diana and Steve's little 'Band of Brothers' are all played really well and are laced with vital backstory! Even Pine's secretary, Etta, is played with real charisma by Lucy Davis. However, the casting for Villain is not great. I do NOT think much of Danny Huston's acting abilities and he's rather poor as the Red Skull-like villain General Ludendorff. The character could have been played better by someone else! Seriously, he's like 'The Count' from Sesame Street. Laughing like a bear and shooting comrades for no good reason... Putting aside the rather pathetic Ares villain, most villainous acting is delivered by Elena Anaya as Dr. Maru. She is very good and really delivers as the psychotic chemist! However, all these great characters (minus Ares and Ludendorff) must have story, and they certainly have a story. All the war and London scenes are written very well. As I said, this is also a 'war movie' and it doesn't shy away from the horror of war, something that Diana really takes to heart and that's beautiful to see! On to the war, the action in this film (apart from the end battle) is brilliant! It's gripping, well-choreographed and very enjoyable. However, it was unrealistic at times and all the sci-fi stuff sometimes made it lag BUT the action still kept on at an explosive pace and was ultimately enjoyable! I also said this film is a romance and it IS! The romance between Trevor and Diana is beautiful to watch and Gadot and Pine share real acting chemistry! They really play the iconic wartime sweethearts! All these good things: the acting, dialogue and even the music really push the story on wards to its finish and as I have stated, this film does have 'blemishes!' The ending battle with Ares was a huge disappointment for me, since I had enjoyed the film all the rest of the way through! It's SO unrealistic and DULL and a real shame since the rest of the story was so entertaining and gripping! I knew this movie would have a sci-fi element and was OK about that and though sometimes it got on my nerves I didn't mind, but the ending made it worse, much worse! I know this makes WONDER WOMAN sound really bad but that's not what I mean. Apart from that part (and let's not forget it's story is written by Zack Snyder), it's a really enjoyable and fun film with a dynamite cast and enjoyable story. Most, importantly, I DID enjoy it. The acting, action and most of the story. It is a good film! I say 'Try it!'",7,1,8,16 October 2017
Black Panther," The Mother Of All Bad Finales!
","I went into BLACK PANTHER with high expectations and looking forward to a fresh and exciting new MCU franchise and for most of the film that was what I got. BLACK PANTHER began as a fun, new, superhero adventure romp with good acting, a fairly decent plot and brilliant visuals. Director Ryan Coogler, for the story of BLACK PANTHER has combined the old, tribal customs of Africa with fresh, new, brilliant technology and a mother load of vibraniam to create a fascinating MCU world. Wakanda is an amazingly colourful world brought to life with the great visual effects and natural scenery. It's looks almost like an African version of Coruscant from STAR WARS. The casting for the most part in this film is brilliant and almost every member is on great form and doing their uttermost. Boseman is obviously the main highlight in this film and gives a very convincing performance as T'Challa. We only caught a small glimpse of his true talent as Black Panther in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film we get a much more thorough and fascinating look at the character with Boseman playing all his characteristics and emotions brilliantly and becoming a real hero we can care about. He's brilliantly complex and multi-layered and a very fun character to spend time with. The rest of the cast is on top form with the likes of Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and several others. They gave real life to the characters and made them fun and interesting. There was one rather silly performance: Michael B. Jordan as the movie's main villain Erik Killmonger. It's not really his fault, it's more the writing. Killmonger as a character and as a villain is completely bland and two-dimensional. Jordan tries his best to save the role and make it convincing, but turns the part into more of a shouting act. On the other hand, it's disappointing that the great Andy Serkis is only made a MINOR villain as Ulysses Klaue. His character is dynamic, fun and really pops so it's a shame that he's 'offed' so early.Now, onto one of the good things but also the problem of this film: the plot. To start, it's fun, action-packed and very entertaining. Coogler choreographs really brilliant action scenes that feel almost like something out of THE MATRIX at some points. It's a great ride with fairly fun characters and that's all great until we get into the 3rd ACT. The finale is possibly one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen and takes a real dump on the whole movie! It's so lazy and stupid and goes WAY beyond the far-fetched antics of the beginning with laser ships, giant rhinos and a VERY disappointing sci-fi battle on the planes. I'm not just saying this because it's set in Africa and involves big cats but the ending is THE LION KING on acid and not in a good way. The whole final battle revolves around Killmonger's plan and it's just SO silly and pointless and frankly something one would expect from the Red Skull. Danai Gurira as Okoye leads her warriors against the villains on the plains and it quickly turns into pure spear porn. The sins of this ending were just SO terrible and it was impossible to overlook them, and this sadly dragged the film down terribly and made it a convoluted, silly, sci-fi mishmash that ruined a perfectly good movie premise. This was a real disappointment when I had such hopes for this movie and had enjoyed it so far.Here's what I say: enjoy Black Panther's role in CIVIL WAR and leave it at that!",5,39,89,17 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," 'This IS The Greatest Show!!!' Period.
","When I came out of this wonderful movie, part of a poem came to mind. The poem is IF by Rudyard Kipling and the quote goes: 'If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on a turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings'. This (in my opinion) describes the spirit and feel of this movie perfectly. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is about following your dreams with the ones you love, it's about being proud of who you are and where you come from and it's about how when you fail and your dreams come toppling down, you CAN build them 10 times back up again! One of the REALLY great things about this movie was just how different it was to what we're used to in today's film industry! It was a wonderful change in the sea of psychological thrillers and police dramas that today's cinema is SO overcrowded with! It's uplifting, inspiring, charming, moving, romantic but most of all has an absolutely killer soundtrack! I can truly say that director Michael Gracey has done an exceptional job in bringing this inspiring and uplifting story to the screen, whatever the critics may say!Obviously, when you look at musicals, the soundtrack must be good and the songs in this film were absolutely BRILLIANT! John Debney and several others have written funky, uplifting, moving songs that really push the film along. The style of the songs are combinations of the old classics like WEST SIDE STORY, modern funk and modern musicals like LA LA LAND. The combination TOTALLY works and I have listened to 'The Greatest Show' several times already. It's fair to say that the songs carry the story. The film gets off to a terrific start with 'the greatest show' and is propelled onwards with several brilliant others. This, of course was due to the awesome vocal talent and this, obviously, was the brilliant cast that Gracey has pulled together. Hugh Jackman leads the show and it feels almost like he was born to play this role. He puts in such enthusiasm and charisma and really becomes a hero that you can root for. Both his acting and his vocal skills were faultless and he really carried this film. The rest of the cast was on top form as well with Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya and Keala Settle. Every single member is on top-form in this film and convey such emotion with their acting and singing! It's a real joy to watch all of the cast and you really grow to care about all of them and their struggles.Now, I know there have been many critics saying that this film is a flop but to quote one critic (Mark Kermode): 'they're wrong!' Critics complain about the pace of the story, the characters, the clichÃ©s but I reason that they simply don't get what the film is about. It's not perfect but that's not what you watch it for, you watch it for a charming, funky, uplifting and romantic escape from all the same-old, same-old films of today! It's colourful and vibrant. Yes, it goes over the top with some of the CGI but it somehow doesn't matter because it's such a fun and fantastic ride and yes, some of the messages feel a bit over-used but they're told in such a kind and sincere way that you end up not caring! This film, overall, was a brilliant ride, charming, uplifting and totally fresh! It may sound silly but after coming out of this film, for a few seconds, I wanted to grab a top hat and join the circus- just to let you know: I HAVEN'T! I really enjoyed and loved this film, it was uplifting and a real feel-good movie but it was also a wonderful and refreshing change for today's cinema! All I can say is: there's a reason it's called the 'GREATEST' SHOMAN!",9,2,6,28 March 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Chaotic, funny, fresh, action-packed and highly enjoyable!
","MATTHEW MAKETH FILM! For some one who grew up with Mr. Connery as 007: swaggering around with his Beretta, the iconic ladies man and never daring to swear, I went in to this film, more than a little skeptical but I am very happy to say that I was NOT LET DOWN AT ALL! Kingsman: The Secret Service is a hugely enjoyable ride and I was hooked from the word 'action'. Kingsman has a lot of the things we've come to expect from most modern-day films: explosive action, swearing, famous faces, end-of-the-world plans and so on, and though Kingsman does indeed have all those things, what it does is it keeps you gripped from the very start! Matthew Vaughn's directing on this giant project is brilliant! Choreographing huge, bloody and explosive actions scenes like the devastating Church massacre, end-of- the-world carnage or the NOW famous pub brawl! But as well as putting together some really brilliant action scenes, Vaughn also really gets the best out of his cast! Every member is on TOP FORM! Colin Firth delivers a brilliant, charismatic and highly enjoyable performance as Agent Harry Hart: a character totally different to what he's used to, and for those of you out there who think all Firth can do is act posh and wear a top hat, YOU ARE WRONG! Firth seriously gets in on the action! But enough about him, Taron Egerton delivers a very well-acted and authentic performance as Eggsy! Egerton plays the slightly yobbo chav very well but he also plays a character who cares deeply for his loved ones and knows the difference of right and wrong! The only criticism I have about Egerton's character (and this applies to the rest of the cast): and that is that there is rather too much swearing! Now I know the odd f*** and sh** is sometimes rather funny but the swearing in this film rather goes over the top and there were a few points where I wanted to say 'Oh wash your mouth-out!' But this was all minor for a film that really delivered! Enjoyable, charismatic, funny and authentic performances from the whole cast! The great Mr. L Jackson is brilliant as the lisping megalomaniac and delivers the performance with real zest and really gets his inner Bond villain on! Very enjoyable performances from co-stars too! Strong is great and (as always) delivers a very strong performance! Authentic performances by Sofia Boutella, Sir Michael Caine and Jack Davenport as well. There is also a hilarious performance turned in by the great Mark Hamill. However, unfortunately his is more of a cameo but still very fun! The scenes are brilliantly acted out by everyone but obviously this is partly down to the script, courtesy of Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn himself! I can wholeheartedly say that the pair deliver a both funny, clever, and dramatic script! This film is more of a action-flick in terms of tension and can sometimes feel predictable but it still keeps you hooked from the very beginning! All these factors propel the film to it's finish, the cataclysmic world VS itself battle and though this is a devastating idea, it is very amusingly uplifted by the soundtrack of KC and the Sunshine band with 'Baby Give it Up'! So, like I've said: all these factors, combined together, produce a really enjoyable and pretty cool film! Obviously it has it's downs, (the swearing and it being more than a little smutty-the princess!) but I think that the good points, firmly out- weigh the bad! A real fun and fresh movie! Roll on the Golden Circle!",8,1,3,22 September 2017
Gangs of New York," Not Great, But Good For The Most Part!
","One thing I can definitely say for Scorsese in this film, is that he knows how to START! GANGS OF NEW YORK has one of the best opening scenes of a movie that I've seen. It's up there with the likes of THE DARK KNIGHT and THE GREATEST SHOWMAN in terms of a best opening scene. It both grips and sets the tone of the entire movie: muscular, stoic and violent with the epic 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) marching to war with his Irish gang of street warriors 'The Dead Rabbits' and his young son Amsterdam (Cian McCormack) to do battle with the vicious Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his racist army of American 'Natives'. I must say I found this film really quotable as well and now, every time I cut myself shaving (accidentally), I find myself repeating the line 'No Son! Never! The Blood Stays On The Blade!' The film REALLY gets off to a great start with this opening scene that leads up to a brutally bloody battle for the Five Points. It's in this first part, that the movie is at its strongest, but as the film progresses with Amsterdam as a grown man (Leonardo DiCaprio) returning to the Five Points for revenge on 'The Butcher' who slew his father, that the film's structure and pace begins to weaken. The violent, epic events of the beginning, are replaced with duller, less-gripping ones and a truly disappointing and underwhelming finale, that leaves you a little cross that you wasted all that time waiting for the clash of the titans that never came! It does thrill at some points with the odd 'Butcher' assassination attempt and the hero (DiCaprio) coming about as close to death as a hero has ever come in movie history. Scorsese also (in my opinion) delivers a really authentic and thorough look into 19th century life in the Five Points. Everything from the props, to the buildings, to the clothes is spot-on for detail and highly authentic. The period drama side of things is faultless with the film capturing all the attitudes and feelings of the period and introducing us to a fairly unknown side of American history (Gangs in the Five Points and the Draft Riots). This is all fine but it's safe to say that the film is carried by its cast and I have chosen the 3 standouts and the 1 absolutely awful performance: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz and Jim Broadbent. DiCaprio is (as usual) convincing, as Amsterdam despite the muddled accent and brings real emotion and passion to the role, unfortunately the character (on a whole) is rather bland and very dull. There's nothing exciting about him as a character, even though DiCaprio does his best in the role. Now, on to Daniel Day-Lewis as 'The Butcher' Bill. This film (like THE DARK KNIGHT) is a good example of a supporting actor TOTALLY stealing the show. Day-Lewis delivers (in my opinion) one of the best performances of his career as Bill. Like Heath Ledger's Joker there are two, brilliantly-acted sides to his antagonist. On one hand he's a vicious, psychotic, racist, cowardly, backstabbing brute, but, on the other hand, he's a true patriot and a fairly 'honourable man'. Both sides to Bill's personality are played brilliantly and Lewis's sudden changes in character (see the 'Poor Little Rabbit' scene) are frankly awesome! Cameron Diaz was also very convincing as the film's main heroine Jenny Everdeane. Diaz adds dome real spice to this role and (in my opinion) saves the character from being lost among so many forgettable screen damsels. She's feisty and fun but also caring and soft-spoken. Diaz certainly proves what a versatile and strong actress she is. Then, there is the one performance that both annoys and puzzles me: Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed. I simply don't know what Scorsese was thinking in casting Broadbent in the role. Broadbent is awful, totally wooden and unrealistic. He READS the part, and it baffles me how he got this part among such a stellar cast in the first place. However, along with the likes of Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly the cast, for the most part, uplifted the rather dull 3/4s of the film and made it a slightly more enjoyable ride.However, the final quarter of the film was what REALLY disappointed me. The problem is: Scorsese spends far too much on time on Amsterdam's saga of 'do I'-'don't I' and the complete inessentials of the plot so that, as he crams in 'Monk' McGinn (Gleeson) running for sheriff, the Draft Riots and another Battle for the Five Points, the film becomes convoluted and terribly rushed. Things certainly needed to be trimmed down here, (I think) Scorsese just needed to synchronise the conclusion better. The conclusion itself was (as I've said) a true disappointment and doesn't deliver the outcome you hoped for (or watched the rest of the movie for). Certainly mixed goods. The acting, beginning and script= goods. Bad= plot, pace and finale. Scorsese can do better and I was left thinking the film could have been better. Much better...",8,2,4,22 April 2018
