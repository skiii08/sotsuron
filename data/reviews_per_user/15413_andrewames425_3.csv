Frost_Nixon," Interesting Concept
","Director Ron Howard took the Richard Nixon interviews with David Frost of the 1970s and made an interesting and entertaining film. I always knew that Nixon resigned from the Presidency, but before I saw this film I had no idea who David Frost was, or that he interviewed Nixon. When David Frost, a talk show host, decides to interview Richard Nixon, the entire nation thinks it is a joke. A man named Jim Reston (in the film, who knows if he was based on a real person) convinces Frost to punish Nixon. He says that Richard Nixon needs 'the trial he never got' and that he should not be able to exonerate himself in the interview. Frost cleverly brings up 'watergate' and keeps asking Nixon until the President cracks under pressure. The initial idea for this film is very interesting and I think it was executed well both in acting and writing.",9,1,2,30 October 2014
Remember the Titans," Great Movie, Somewhat Exaggerated
","Remember the Titans is and always will be one of my favorite films. The writing, the acting and the soundtrack all contribute to the success of the film. I loved the fact that it is based on a true story, because I felt even more attached to the characters. But like all 'based on a true story' films, there were some inaccuracies in the story.I found out that the friendship between Gerry and Julius was not as strong in reality as it was in the film. Some dates were way off, there were many anachronisms in the rules and references, and some characters (Ronnie Bass in particular) were portrayed wrong. Nevertheless, I loved this movie. If you are someone who watches films based on their historic accuracy, Remember the Titans probably isn't for you. If, however, you are someone who loves motivation, humor, drama and happy endings, you'll love this movie.",9,0,1,28 September 2014
The Great Gatsby," Not close to the book
","I understand that this movie is set in 'the roaring 20's' and that everything is supposed to be extravagant, but the way this movie was made stripped it of its credibility.In the beginning of the movie, Nick Carraway is telling his story years later from an alcohol rehabilitation center. Right from the start, the story is altered. If the opening scene doesn't coincide with the novel, what other major changes can we expect? Is this movie going to be anything like Fitzgerald's novel? Later we arrive at the house party scenes. The party at Gatsby's estate was just like I imagined. I was convinced that this was 1920's authentic, until I heard Jay-Z and Kanye West in the background. Maybe this wasn't a problem for other people but to me the music was out of place. My last problem with this movie's execution was the car chase scenes. Something about the set made the entire scene look like a cartoon. Was I supposed to believe that Gatsby could actually drive 100 miles per hour without looking or steering? Or was the movie now completely fictional. I expected a different movie. This movie was hardly similar to the novel 'The Great Gatsby' and I think the director could have done a better job to make it like the book.",6,3,4,30 November 2014
