The Equalizer," Old School Action
","A one man show from Denzel Washington in The Equaliser makes it an engaging action movie even though the film is too predictable and clich√©d. Smart dialogues, old and conventional but good doses of action and above all a stylish performance from the Academy Award winner DW makes this film a watchable one. Robert McCall who is leading a quiet and peaceful life after retiring as a Black Ops Commando is forced out of his self imposed exile to get back to where he was and what he does best. On trying to help his female friend Alina who is a sex slave in the hands of her pimp, McCall confront and take down the Russian mafia single handedly to extract revenge.Story wise, the film has nothing new to showcase but Washington deserves full marks to make the film a watchable one through his smart and stylish acting , action and dialogue presentation. Its not that we have action each and every scene but an action mood is created throughout the entire length of the film.On the acting side, as said earlier its more or less a one man show from Denzel Washington and he is supported well by a host of other actors especially Marton Czokas enacting the character of Teddy the main henchman of Russian mafia don Pushkin.Nice camera work and cuts along with impressive background score too. But the VFX had some drawbacks, to be specific the bombing scene of undercover building of the gangsters. The latter portions have been too stretched and deserved a trimming of ten to fifteen minutes.Overall, here is a money worth old school action and revenge movie for a target audience that serves its purpose and i go with seven out of ten for The Equaliser. With a sequel in the early planning stages doing the talk, its better you get a feel of the movie now and get ready for more thrills.",7,1,3,21 November 2014
Interstellar," Technically Brilliant & Outstanding
","Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is just awesome and absolutely brilliant piece of work. Coming from a master craftsman with such a high directorial range, the concept the vision and the ambiguity of a bigger canvas used to convey this complex theme puts Interstellar as one of the best films from Hollywood that has been visualized and conceptualized brilliantly.Set in a not so distant future where Earth is on the brink of extinction, Cooper and family notice strange happenings at their home and surroundings. To find a solution to this problem and to save mankind, a group of astronauts lead by Cooper on the advise from NASA chief venture into the galaxy through a wormhole to find a new home for mankind for their ultimate survival. Hope i have the story line written correctly. Honestly, i need to watch it a second time to get a better picture of the plot especially the final half an hour.Based on this plot, Nolan has created a marvelous film that you should watch only in theater and not on DVD. Such is the magnitude of this magnum opus that provides a grand cinematic experience on the big screen. Direction is top notch and the execution is perfect. The importance given to the emotional aspect between Cooper and his little daughter Murph was too touching and made us connected with them.Matthew McConaughey as Cooper was brilliant and Mackenzie Foy as the little daughter of Cooper was also impressive. The other supporting actors like Anne Hathaway, Micheal Caine, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon and Wes Bentley also did their part in making the performance area stand out.Technically too, the film is one step ahead and for that each and every area contributed their best and among them the background score was too impressive and outstanding to elevate the film. So here is one film that you should not miss at any cost and I go with a double thumbs up to Christopher Nolan.",8,1,8,21 November 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," A Sure Shot Take from the Marvel Studio
","A movie that lived up above the hype, that's what I felt like after seeing this movie. I am huge fan of Russo brothers after seeing their epic Winter Soldier movie but felt disappointed with their take on Civil War (Strictly personal). So, in order to avoid the hype, I decided not to watch any tv spots that released, and that method worked btw.The movie started exactly where Thor: Ragnarok finished. As usual the movie followed the same pattern that every marvel movies does. Its loaded with a lot of fun during the battles but everything is well balanced. Each character got their own screen time. If anyone ask which character scored above all it is so hard to tell. I felt like Russo brothers managed to give the importance that each character deserves. The movie is packed with a lot of Goosebumps scenes which is enough to burst out the cinema hall.I'm not getting into the story as there is no point in explaining considering the hype but everything that a marvel fan needs is included in this movie. It took more than 10 years to see Thanos properly, but I would like to say that he just went a long way beyond my expectation. Visually the movie is top notch as we can easily identify that the studio invested a lot of money which resulted into eye popping action.Overall in my opinion THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE ever made by the studio (Previously it was Winter Soldier). The movie got only 1 post credit scene which was scheduled at the end credits.",9,13,45,25 April 2018
Gone Girl," Slow But Engaging Thriller
","David Fincher's Gone Girl is a slow paced thriller and engages you for the full two and a half hours with a different way of story telling which is not something that we see quite often. The film stands out with solid performances to complement and back the narrative to make it a must watch thriller that is mixed with the right doses of emotion and drama. The variety in how the story has been treated is too refreshing and puts Gone Girl in the league of some of the best films from Hollywood.The story has two central protagonists Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Benn Affleck). They fall in love and gets married but gradually difference of opinion puts gap in their marital life. On their fifth wedding anniversary day Nick returns home only to find that Amy is missing leaving some hidden clues but not conclusive enough for a breakthrough. The investigation that follow for the search and cause of Amy's missing is presented too well in this film from Fincher.The film has a slow pace initially but gradually picks up momentum and the treatment of the drama is such that never the movie goes dull or unexciting. As said earlier, direction and screenplay is backed by solid performances from all the actors to make Gone Girl a well crafted film in every department.Ben Affleck was in fine form as Nick Dunne portraying the character entrusted to him with such perfection and finesse. Matching equally was Rosamund Pike as Amy. Kim Dickens (as Detective Rhonda) was another actor who stood out with a terrific performance to match the lead pair. Also impressive was Carry Coon as Nick's sister and Tyler Perry who is the advocate helping Nick in his legal battle.So in every aspect, this movie stands apart and here is one cinema you cannot miss at any cost. Since i haven't read Gillian Flynn's novel, i am not in a position to say how far the adaptation from book has been but that does not stop me from giving four out of five for David Fincher's Gone Girl, a slow and an engaging thriller with a presentation that deserves a big thumbs up. 'GO FOR IT' is the final verdict from here.",8,2,9,3 November 2014
Black Panther," Long Live The King
","This time I agree with the same old cliche dialogue 'The best marvel movie till date' Undoubtedly the best standalone movie made by marvel studios.The story starts right after the events happened in CA : Civil War. The movie starts in slow pace, but once the Killmonger gets introduced the story shifted into a fast pace momentum. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa scores just like he did in Civil war. But the real performer - Michael B Jordan plays the brutal Killmonger steals the show especially in the climax area.The movie is well balanced with right amount action and humor. No one liners or jokes in between battles. Cinematography is another one which eligible for a round of applause.The way they showed Wakanda.So much detailing in every aspect. With a perfect color tone, well managed CGI and some kick ass stunts the entire movie delivers a different experience for me.",8,7,35,14 February 2018
Happy New Year," Visually Stunning But...
","Well one of the biggies from Bollywood has reached cinemas to ignite the spark already we have in the country with all the celebrations connected with the festival of lights and crackers in full swing. As expected, the film has lavish sets and foreign visuals, rich & colorful feel with vibrant costumes and above all the towering presence of the Badshah from Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan. But other than these and other than what the trailers showed, Happy New Year directed by Farah Khan has nothing much to offer content wise. The story mixed with humor and revenge has a heist backdrop and that is quite common in Bollywood these days with every superstar becoming part of such plots now. Charlie /ChandraMohan Manohar Sharma (Shah Rukh), Nandu (Abhishek Bachchan), Mohini (Deepika), Jagmohan (Sonu Sood), Tammy (Boman Irani) and Rohan (Vivaan Shah) are the six people or rather losers who are the participants of World Dance Competition in Dubai with a hidden agenda. How these losers become the ultimate winners is what the movie is all about.For a festive season, people looking for a mass film of this magnitude,HNY might be more than enough to satisfy their entertainment quotient but as a cinema other than technical finesse and rich visuals this is not a great film and perhaps if you leave your logical side of the brain at home before taking off to theaters, there are chances that you might be able to enjoy this stuff that has nothing much in terms of any unexpected twists and turns. The biggest highlight and life of the film even with the negative aspects is of course SRK. He brings that much needed color to the film when the proceedings becomes tiring. So it is more of a Shah Rukh Khan show all packed in a predictable and clich√É¬©d Bollywood film with all the mass elements. Abhishek was comical but went overboard at times. Deepika was sexy and charming, Boman Irani was funny well supported by Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah. Jackie Shroff as the baddie was stylish. On the technical aspects, cinematography, edits, choreography and background score were impressive. Also the costume designer deserves praise for coming out with such varied and colorful costumes to give some richness to the overall feel. I wouldn't say Vishal Shekhar has done a bad job in composing the songs but they were not impressive either.Overall this three hour film is just an entertainer and a one time watchable one apt for a festive season with nothing much to rave about in terms of content. Whether you want to watch it and whether it will make you Happy or not it's up to you to watch and decide.P.S - Please don't miss out the end title credits. There is something special out there.",5,3,9,3 November 2014
Godzilla," Best Godzilla Film Compared to Roland Emmerich Version
","First of all don't expect more by seeing the trailer which was so awesome. Godzilla which is a reboot of Roland Emmerich version released in 1998 which appears more bigger and stronger creatures that its previous version.The film tells us the history of Godzilla's previous appearance from the past and its rivalry with MUTO (MOBILE UNIDENTIFIED TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS). About the story line its good and will get proper knowledge about the things that happened in past. The main highlight of this film is its VFX. The intro of Godzilla is so cool and awesome with a stunning BGM. The fight between Godzilla and MUTO is so good which gives us goosebumps.Godzilla's less screen space is one of the negative side that I noticed in the film. In the case of MUTO its vice versa. Another one is about the Human characters. Bryan Cranston is the only one that I find appealing. But sadly he just only for few minutes only. Aaron Taylor is just for covering the screen. 3D effects is another negative in this film. Nowadays 3D is considered as a best way to make more income.To sum up Godzilla is one the best reboot film compared to the previous version. But don't expect awesome stunts like Pacific Rim and set your expectation level to the bare minimum, you should be able to enjoy the film.",7,3,8,16 May 2014
