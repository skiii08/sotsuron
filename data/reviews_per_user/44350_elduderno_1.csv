Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Best Comedy of the year!
","This has been a good year for the genre comedies, but I honestly feel that this is the most I have laughed since 40-Year Old Virgin. Sacha Baron Cohen is genius. His character is the best ever played in a while. The film was so well done and was so funny I was literally on the floor laughing at some scenes. The plot was hilarious and the movie did not fail at all. From New York to the South or to Los Angels the movie kept me laughing always. Borat is a hilarious comedy that will be heard about for years to come. It is controversial, but it handles it so well and proves to be a smart comedy. The writing was brilliant! Some of the lines, even ones that were in subtitled were too funny for words. The film is racy but it makes you laugh and is a real good comedy.",10,2,13,6 November 2006
