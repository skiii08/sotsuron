Skyfall," A Dark Knight Tailored in a Tux
","I couldn't help but notice how similar this film felt to the dark knight, which I think is a very strong film. Skyfall runs on a parallel track evident in it's direction, plot, villain, and play between leads. And you know what? I don't care if it did, it worked.Skyfall falls easily into Bond's top 5, if not top 3 go-arounds. The film holds it's own with the likes of Goldfinger, Goldeneye, and Craig's predecessor Casino Royale. I'm debating exactly where it will settle and having just viewed it, time will decide.The best way to describe Skyfall is as almost a combination of those three Bond films mentioned. It pulls aspects from each: Goldfinger's strong antagonist, the villain's close relationship to MI6 as in Goldeneye, and Royale's/Craig's take on the franchise.It subtlety hearkens back to the days of distinguished bond villains and memorable moments as with the pistol contest all while adhering to the new Bond feel. Later there are apparent calls to the originals with the inclusions of a classic car, familiar characters and drinks.In fact, this film seems to actually bridge Craig's and Connery's world in a way with the set up of the new MI6, Q, and the transition of M and her secretary.Skyfall not only succeeds as a great film and a strong performance for Craig but also acts as a farewell, thank you, and nod to Judi Dench and her M. Judi gets ample screen time and acts as an integral part of the film. Needless to say, as usual, Judi did not disappoint in her increased role. She was on point and delivered. Her performance is even more impressive given her unfortunate health condition. This film took a long time to get done and I'm sure Judi's health and age factored into the plot direction.I believe the poor use and abundance of speed in Quantum of Solace was correctly noted because Skyfall makes sure to slow it down and does so in the right spots. I'm pretty sure Bardem isn't even revealed until the second half. The studio sure didn't shy away from Bardem's character either as his villain included an aspect most producers avoid. They made the right choice for more than one reason.Not only is the movie done right but Adele provides a fitting, powerful theme as well.And as for the film's faults, well, my main quip of the film is actually the little Bond horn snippets at the very beginning. I think it would have worked much better if they kept to only the natural scene sounds. Once he lands in the train cab than cue the full horns and theme. That's what I would have done anyway, but I know that's ticky-tacky.Anyway, I would highly recommend Skyfall not just to Bond fans new and old, but also to the everyday popcorn lover.",8,0,7,9 November 2012
