The Blair Witch Project," cinema held promise with BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!!!
","So i'm at my friends house for dinner,drinks,and deep convo that always leads to some kind of fierce and exciting debate of life,liberty and love for mankind, but this time is different!!! One of my 'unpolished' friends decides that the film BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is one of the worst 'pieces of crap' that he's ever seen! Well if you can stomach that Hollywood creates repeats of the same ol' regurgitated versions of so-called 'horror films' then, power to ya!! To know fear is something special. Blair witch delivers!!! People should understand that reality is the ultimate realm of fear! This film with it's realism, and 1'st person view, draws you into how an intense and absolute horrific situation can really be!! The audience is drawn into their own imagination of terror, which is the ultimate rush of fear in my books! Lost in the woods, no direction, food, things messing with you during a sleepless night, hearing impossible sounds from the environment? If you've ever been camping, or alone in the woods, this flick brings you back to every dark fear you have ever known! True to the title, this feature is 'scary as hell'. You will never forget how intense the fear of what you can't see can alter reality! Best horror movie i've ever seen, period!!!!",10,10,20,11 September 2006
