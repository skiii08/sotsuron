Moneyball," The key to small-market success in Baseball
","The team has just lost. They lost their playoff round, they lost their spirits, and, most of all, they've lost their three best players: Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, and Jason Isringhausen. Thanks to the prevalence of big-budget teams, smaller organizations like the A's are losing all of their best players; one could even go as far as saying that these lesser franchises could be considered farm systems for the big boys in New York or Boston. As is his job, A's GM Billy Beane is faced with filling three roster spots that the lost players once occupied. When he goes in the scouting meeting, all he hears is the same old jargon. Scouts repeat things like 'five-tool player' and 'a great-looking swing', which reminds Beane of when he was a hot prospect coming out of high school. Having been the target of these scouts' attention previously, Beane doesn't trust the traditional player evaluation process, and that is where Peter Brand comes in. On a visit to the GM for the Cleveland Indians, Mark Shapiro, Billy fails to find a single trade, and he sees a man whispering advice to Shapiro's assistant. As he leaves through the offices, Billy sees this same man at a cubicle, and he confronts him. The man's name is Peter Brand, and after a few minutes, we learn that Peter is fresh out of Yale with a degree in Economics. This first meeting is where Brand reveals his unique player evaluation system. Just like Beane, Brand sees that the big budget teams are suffering from inflated contracts for some players, and they're severely undervaluing others. Basing his idea off of a groundbreaking book by Bill James, Peter Brand uses a statistical data system that, in theory, will give the A's a chance against the big budget organizations. After 'buying' Peter from Cleveland, Beane gets set to revitalize Oakland, and immediately he knows that it will be a challenge. My Thoughts In an era where the contracts for major athletic talent are skyrocketing in price, the Oakland A's were one of the first teams to go against the grain, and this film tells their story. The concept of using statistical analysis to judge talent rather than the traditional way was an unpopular idea back a decade or so ago, but nowadays it is a major familiarity. Thanks to the idea, many baseball teams have earned championship hardware, most notably the San Francisco Giants. As I have said before, I am a fully devoted Giants fan, and I can attest to the fact that the concept made famous across the Bay Bridge has found success on this side. GM Brian Sabean utilizes Moneyball's key principles, and in turn has brought a trio of trophies home. The acting performances are very well executed, especially by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Pitt's role as the layered Billy Beane is great for the actor, and he played it perfectly. Pitt captures the troubling past that Beane had as a player, the difficulty as a divorced man with a growing daughter, and the rapid emotions that flow throughout a real-life baseball season. In a rare dramatic role, Jonah Hill is fantastic as the quirky Peter Brand, nailing both the serious and comical scenes throughout the film with relative ease. This film based on our national pastime received quite a lot of recognition from the public, including the Academy. Though it did not win any, Moneyball was nominated for six Oscar categories, most notably Best Picture, Best Actor (Pitt), Best Supporting Actor (Hill), and Adapted Screenplay. I personally believe that Hill's performance and the screenplay were definitely deserving of an award. From the moment that some of you saw the basic storyline of this movie, you might have written it off as a sports movie; however, it is about so much more than just baseball. In this film, the baseball is simply the background setting, and the people behind the scenes are the real focus of the plot. Although quite a bit of the humor is baseball-related, it is still applicable to almost everyone. My one major disclaimer is the infrequent language. It's a PG-13 rated film, and the language is deserving of it. A couple F-words and some smaller curses (sh**, a**, etc.) are uttered, but they're applicable to their situation. This is a fantastic sports-related movie, and I recommend to everyone who even remotely likes either sports or the people behind it.",8,1,2,2 January 2015
Meet the Parents," The boyfriend's worst nightmare.
","It's every man's worst nightmare: meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time. This idea is even more intimidating for Greg Focker (Stiller), a male nurse, who hopes to soon propose to his girlfriend Pam. As Pam's sister has just been proposed to, the couple is invited to the wedding, and meets Pam's parents. On first glance, Pam's father Jack is kind and loving; however, we soon see Jack calling someone for Greg's legal records and files. Even for the most innocent person, this is something that you do not want someone to be investigating into. As the two men talk more and more, Jack becomes more and more suspicious and unforgiving towards Greg. Not long after, polygraph tests are given, events become disasters, and life for Greg becomes a torment.I originally wanted to see this because it featured my favorite actor, Robert De Niro. Though he usually is in a role where he is a mobster, hit-man, etc., this is one of the roles where he tried his hand at comedic acting. After successes like Analyze This, where he made fun of his tough- guy persona, he received more lighthearted roles, and this is one of them. The plot itself is simple. A man meets his potential father-in-law, and the father-in-law makes his time miserable. Before I hit 'Play', I thought, 'Well they'll have some good jokes, Stiller will do his usually shenanigans, and it'll end soundly. Needless to say, it did not go as I thought. The basic plot's humor wears off within the first 40 minutes, and the remaining 1 hour and 8 minutes is just potty humor, distasteful sex jokes, and Ben Stiller looking stupid (as usual). I'm not sure if it was my expectations coming into the film that were too high, or the quality of the film was so low in actuality, but I did not like this film very much. I can appreciate low-brow humor when it is done correctly, but the Stiller brand of comedy is not one that I've ever found good, and I doubt that I ever will. www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",Null,0,1,18 December 2014
Se7en," Two homicide detectives must track down a serial killer who uses the 'Seven Deadly Sins' as his guideline for his killings
","Detective William Somerset's years as a homicide detective have come down to their last seven days. He has closed many a case, and we meet him as he encounters his last Young Detective David Mills has just transferred to the local police force as Somerset's replacement, and he shooting from his hip as soon as he walks into the first crime scene. Local police have found an extremely obese man dead in his house, and after a few minutes of investigating, the initially believed cause of death, brain hemorrhage, is soon replaced with murder. The two detectives conclude that the victim was forced to eat by his killer, and then kicked in the stomach. This is but our first taste (insensitive pun unintended) of the sick world that this story takes place in. Within 24 hours of this, a top-notch attorney is found dead in his office, and the word 'greed' written into the carpet. On an inquiry of the first victim's apartment, Somerset finds the word 'gluttony' carved into the wall behind the fridge. It does not take Somerset and Mills to realize that this unknown killer is systematically murdering his victims using the themes of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. With the identity of the killer, and 5 more victims helplessly unaware of what is to come, detectives Mills and Somerset must find their man, and navigate the dark world that surrounds them. If the first murder wasn't an obvious clue, this is a dark movie. The 'gluttony' victim, and all of the other victims for that matter, is brutally executed, and most of the grisly remains are what we see. Though we do not see the murders themselves, there is little left to the imagination. In this aspect, this luridly-themed film took me to my limit, and perhaps past it. I would like to think that I can handle just about anything that a camera can show, but this film proved me terrifyingly wrong. Putting the murders aside, this film was very well put together. Freeman does a great job of playing the 'old vet' archetype, and Brad Pitt as the young rookie is a well-cast role. Kevin Spacey as our 'John Doe' makes the antagonist utterly sickening, which is exactly what director David Fincher wanted. From a cinematography standpoint, the film was well-shot, and the editing (Oscar-nominated) was very well done. I will leave you with a few key points that I feel I must emphasize. As a devout Christian, I found the killer's system very appalling, and I dearly hope that the public does not associate this with any Christian value. In case you did not pick this up in my previous notes, this film is DARK. I myself had to watch through my fingers at times, and I have no doubt that any future viewer will as well. The language in itself is R-rated, and it just adds to the dreariness. In his review of this film, the late film critic Roger Ebert began by saying ' 'Seven,' a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see film-making of a high order.'The thrills did thrill, and the horrors did horrify, but I found it too far exposed. Though Fincher is known for his dark portrayal of life (Fight Club, I'm talking about you), this film took it past my favorable level.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",8,2,3,18 December 2014
Alien," The movie before to good one
","Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship...Nostromo? The crew of this commercial towing vessel is nearing the end of their large voyage, and they have definitely reached the end of their wits. With bonuses and families in mind, the crewmembers are looking forward to their life on Earth. Just when they think that the voyage is over, they receive a signal from an unknown planet, and they decide to investigate. When an enigmatic foreign organism attaches itself to one of the exploring crewmembers, the crew lets the alien of unknown origin onto the spacecraft, and they soon realize that they made a mistake. As the original film in one of the most successful franchises in the sci-fi/horror movie sub- genre, Alien was a defining moment in film. Filmed on an unprecedentedly small $8.4 million budget, this movie showed that with a devoted director and some resourcefulness, almost any film can be accomplished. This was Ridley Scott's big break as a director, and he would go on to give us great films like Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and American Gangster. Though it was capitalized by its visual effects, this film also had some great characters; including Ellen Ripley, who is one of the most iconic female bada** characters in film history. Also, the movies version of aliens, a popular sci-fi staple, is also very recognizable. Now let's talk about the horror aspect of the movie. Besides a few short instances, I was not as scared as I expected to be. I accredit it to my previous knowledge of the infamous 'chest- bursting' scene. For both those who have and have not witnessed this great film, I definitely suggest the experience that this film offers.I was very impressed with the low-budget effects, which still hold up today. However, I was not as into it as I was hoping, and as horror is the main focus, this fault definitely took some points off the board.",8,0,1,18 December 2014
Shutter Island," A Federal Marshal and his new partner travel to a psychiatric hospital on an island in search of a missing patient
","Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule have been given a new case. A woman has disappeared from a hospital for the criminally insane. When he and his partner arrive, they meet the head doctor, and they see the former patient's room. After noticing multiple inconsistencies, and the nurses and guards refuse to allow Daniels to see certain information about the patients, suspicion arises. As he tries to investigate further, Daniels experiences multiple flashbacks, both to his World War II encounter while liberating a concentration camp and his late wife. As the story continues, more and more questions arise, and the answers will be hard to find. When I first saw the trailers and posters for this film, I thought it was a horror movie. It takes place mostly on a mysterious island, there is a mental hospital, and the lone still of a frail patient putting a finger to her mouth were enough to create this preconception. I have never been a huge fan of the horror movie genre. I can appreciate a film that incorporates shocking images to add to the story, but I feel like many horror flicks are simply made with the sole purpose of making its viewers wet their pants, Contrary to my previous thought, this movie is in fact not necessarily a horror movie. It may qualify as one to some people, but I found it to be more of a psychological thriller. Also, a twist ending, when executed properly, can earn my respect any day. I have found that the duo between Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese has produced many of our modern classics. Usually associated with the gangster sub-genre, Scorsese wanted to create a film that incorporated some of his favorite aspects of many thriller genre movies. The story does a fantastic job of portraying the human mind's wild nature, and how it can change how we see the world. Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of showcasing the emotional aspects of his character, Sir Ben Kingsley does a fine job of creating a character that is both trustworthy and suspicious, and Mark Ruffalo's character also makes the audience unsure of what he is thinking. Though this film was not recognized by the Academy, I have found this to be one of my favorite thriller movies, and favorite horror-type film as well. Now I must warn you, this is a rated R film, and it is deservedly so. The violence and graphic images are pretty intense. That's my warning, and I hope that you take that into account before seeing this film. While I see that it is necessary to show the intense images in order to understand Teddy's experiences and how the other characters act, they did not quite sit right in my stomach.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",8,0,1,18 December 2014
Interstellar," A team of physicists and explorers embark on a quest through a wormhole in space in order to find an inhabitable planet for humankind
","In a small town, farmers everywhere are struggling to grow crops, frequent sandstorms are a regular event, and people are beginning to flee to another place. Sounds like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, right? Wrong. In a time that is not clearly represented, Cooper and his family are farmers in a world that has done away with military, and the earth itself is the new 'no-man's land.' With the land all over Earth failing, a top-secret operation by NASA has been arranged for explorers to travel through a wormhole and explore the galaxy for a safe new home for Earth's population. Cooper, an ex-NASA pilot, stumbles upon this plan, and he is recruited by his old friend to be seated at the helm of the travel. With two children, and no wife to look after them, Cooper makes the undesirable decision to leave Earth in search of its replacement. At a close second to Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite active directors in the film industry. Known for very intricate and mind-blowing plots, as well as very deep themes, Nolan has burst onto the scene of Hollywood at the turn of the decade. Sitting in the director's seat for box-office and pop culture giants like The Dark Knight and Inception, he has fully established himself in a short amount of time. In this film, he continues to do what he does best, and this will soon join the earlier listed films on his iconic resume. Like Nolan films before it, Interstellar has stunning visuals (both through effects and cinematography) and great themes at its core. Though it does not match the unprecedentedly brilliant space visuals that 2013's Gravity had, this film is still very impressive in its depiction of the vastness up above. With themes like the bonds in a family, love, courage, and sacrifice at its heart, this film plays on the heartstrings of the viewer with excellence. In terms of acting, it was quite good. McConaughey is the perfect man for this role as a soulful Southern/Texan that loves his family and the world he lives in. Around him, there are quite a few notable actors playing as support. Anne Hathaway plays one of Cooper's team members, John Lithgow plays the father-in-law, Michael Caine plays the wise professor, Jessica Chastain is the aged version of Cooper's daughter, Casey Affleck his aged son, and Matt Damon appears for a small, yet important, amount of screen time. In a film where the acting takes a backseat to the story itself, the cast does a good job in their roles. Being that this is a Christopher Nolan film, the storyline is a pretty large maze for the mind to comprehend. With time travel, space travel, and many other things (which would be a spoiler), the story puts the film into the category of movies that require multiple viewings. As this film just came out a week or so ago, it will be some time until award season, but here are some predictions about what aspects of the film I think will receive acclaim. Sound (Mixing/Editing) Visual Effects Original Score Original Screenplay As I have said before, the visuals and sound are a big part of the film, and they are very well done. Therefore, I strongly suggest that you see this film in the theater first, or maybe even at the IMAX. In order to fully appreciate this film's qualities, you must experience it on the big screen.The plot kind of left certain things out that would have helped me understand it more, and that makes it hard to appreciate itwww.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",8,1,3,18 December 2014
American Sniper," The story of a US Navy SEAL's four tours in the Iraq War, and his days on the home-front in between.
","United States Marines breach the doors of a neighborhood, and he's there on over-watch. On his very first tour in Iraq, Chris Kyle has been tasked with surveillance and protecting the men on the ground. As the Marines continue to bust down doors and clearing houses, a son and his mother appear in a doorway. The two people seem inconspicuous, but when the woman removes a Russian grenade from underneath her clothes and hands it to her young son, her status as a potential threat is definitely affirmed. Chris is hesitant, and we understand why. How can he kill a young boy and a woman? In a split-second decision, he assures himself of the need for the trigger to be pulled, and he takes the shot. Growing up, Chris always wanted to be a cowboy. He went hunting with his father, fought off the bullies that tormented his little brother, and he rode broncos for a while. But after realizing the need for a brave man like him to be in the dangerous streets of Iraq, he signs up as a SEAL. After the rigorous training, he graduates from his class, and he meets someone. Her quick wit and initial dismissive attitude towards Chris is harsh. 'My sister was engaged to a SEAL once, so I've got you figured out.' Apparently Chris was the exception to her preconception, and they were married soon after. Once Chris finally deploys, he is an instant asset to the forces in Iraq. Quickly acquiring the label 'Legend' by his teammates, Chris is the hottest shot in Iraq, and he realizes the need that his fellow soldiers have for him. After each stint back at home, he is becoming less and less able to adjust back to civilian life, and he repeatedly returns to the battlefield. He's not bloodthirsty, he just feels like his duty is to protect his friends. With the enemy still running rampant through the area, Chris has to choose between the men on the ground and his family back home.About 2 years ago, I was in search of a book to read for my vacation, and I stumbled upon this book. It seemed interesting, and I've always had a strange fascination with snipers, so I thought it would be a good read. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, which is written in the words of the real-life SEAL, and the announcement that a film adaptation was being made excited me. As a movie, I found the story of Chris Kyle to be just about an exact replica of what I had imagined as I flipped the pages of the autobiography. Director Clint Eastwood's version of this story is well- thought out, and it doesn't glorify the war, it just tells a story. Though it does obviously show some of the 160+ confirmed kills that are marked on Kyle's file, it doesn't make it all about the violence. A large part of the movie focuses on how the distance between Chris and his family tears him apart, and how he has to cope with the tragedies that come with war. Nominated for Best Picture, American Sniper is most likely going to be drowned out by the success of Oscar front-runners like Boyhood, Birdman, and The Imitation Game. I attribute this prediction to the fact that the conflicts in the Middle East are unpopular the minds of some, and this may deter the views of numerous voters. In my opinion, however, I've found this film to be very worthy of its nomination, and it is a shame that it will probably go unnoticed in this category. Much of the success that this movie has achieved can be attributed to the brilliant performance by Bradley Cooper as Chris. Cooper's portrayal of Chris covers each aspect of the character perfectly, and he captures the essence of the hardships that Chris faced throughout his life. Not to my surprise, Cooper has been nominated for a Best Actor award in the 2015 Academy Awards this year, which is the third in his career. Based on what I have read and heard from various sources, I unfortunately do not think that the third time will be the charm for the actor. With highly lauded performances by both Michael Keaton (Birdman) and Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) this year, I fear that Cooper's great effort will not end with an Oscar win. Outside of the acting, the action was quite good. In contrast to the blood-heavy approach by other war films, this movie prefers to show only what is necessary for the proper effect of the violence. Another part of the action that I appreciated was the realistic idea that not every shot is a kill, and not every sniper kill is a head-shot.I recommend this to anyone who appreciates the man that saved an uncountable amount of lives, and also someone who obviously doesn't mind the violence and language that go along with a rated R war flick.",9,19,42,18 January 2015
Hugo," An orphan living in the clock tower of a Paris train station seeks to find what he is missing in his life.
","It's 1930's Paris in the winter. Smoke puffs out of fireplaces, and the large clock of the train station clicks on. A boy, probably 10 years of age, peeks out of a hole between the 3 and 4 on the clock's face, and he energetically climbs down to the station floor. He steals a piece of bread, and then he sees it. There is an older man sitting at the counter of a small shop, and he's dozing off. The boy sneaks up to the counter, and just as he grasps a mechanical mouse on the counter, the old man's hand descends upon the boy's, and we learn that this is not the first time such an instance has occurred. 'What's is your name, thief?' the old man asks. With a sob, the young boy replies, 'Hugo Cabret.' As the camera follows young Hugo back to his 'home', we see that he is a lonely orphan, and his only companion, if one my call it such, is a automaton that is missing a piece from his late father. However, this loneliness all changes when he meets young Isabelle, the goddaughter of the same old man who owns the toyshop. An avid book enthusiast, Isabelle has always wanted to have her own grand adventure, and she seeks to help Hugo not only find the missing piece to his automaton, but the orphan's life as well. Little to the children's knowledge, the automaton will simply be the beginning to the discoveries to come.Though on the surface this film appears to be a kids' movie about an orphan and his broken automaton, it does not take long for this facade to disperse, and for the real object of interest: the imagination of film. Without giving away any spoilers, the art and magical nature of cinema ends of being a major theme of this film. The story takes us back to the very first films by the Lumiere Brothers in 1895, and it carries us into cinema's deepest roots, back when there were no movie stars, no audible dialogue, and any color was hand-tinted by the director. The art of classic films is explored, and the imaginative nature behind them is displayed for all. In terms of genre, this film was a jump for director Martin Scorsese. As a man whose films usually revolve around the Italian society, primarily the Mob, he has made a few attempts to stray from this preconception, and this is one of his finest in doing so. This film was his first endeavor into completely digital filmmaking, and he brings his signature cinematography to the modern medium. In numerous interviews, Scorsese had said that this was his 'love-letter to film.' As he made this film, the director takes us into his heart that still beats with the joy that he felt as a young boy when he would go to the cinema. As one may assume, this film received quite a bit of critical acclaim. Though nominated for 9 Oscars, most notably Best Picture, Hugo came home with 5 awards: Cinematography, Art Direction, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and Visual Effects. I for one believe that this is only of Scorsese's best films from a cinematography standpoint. My few negative points are quite trifling, yet bear with me. I did not like how the setting is Paris, France, and yet the characters all have British accents. I know that this is trivial, but it did catch my attention. Secondly, I did not like how the story only shows Hugo's father for such a short moment, and the father's death is too quickly shown. I understand that the film was made with children as the audience, yet I still feel that they should have lingered a bit longer. Though it is rated PG, and the titular character is a child, this film can apply to nearly anyone. The art of the moving picture has somewhat lost its credibility, and it takes a film like this to remind us of that. I fully recommend this film to anyone who is a cinefile like myself, and the negative parts are like single frames in the rolls of film that put together this movie.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",9,1,3,18 December 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Following his release from a mental institution, a man comes home to live with his parents. He soon meets a woman in the neighborhood, and they bond through their oddities
","Pat Solitano is an interesting man. The audience meets him just as he is being released from a mental institution after serving his time for assaulting the man who was sleeping with his wife. Though he remains aware of his problem, he refuses to take his prescribed medication, and he struggles through his time on the screen. With a mind disillusioned with the idea that his wife who left him still loves him, and that he just needs to talk to her, Pat is visibly incompetent of letting his past mistakes go. Although his parents do their best to point him in the right direction, he insists on trying to go back in time. When he meets Tiffany, he finds someone who he can use to send written letters to his ex-wife. As time goes on, however, he begins to realize that his past life isn't important, and that the present (Tiffany) is what he should pay attention to. Tiffany is troubled in her own way. Her husband was killed from a fatal car crash, and she hasn't been the same since. Looking for some form of solace and acceptance, she became, shall we say, a loose girl. She has made herself a vulnerable object, and she is desperate for a way out. Once she meets Pat, she finds someone who is suffering in his own way. Though at first their personalities clash, they soon find that the other is exactly what the other needs to go through life. Pat Sr. is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, or at least that's what he is on the surface. With dreams of a restaurant of his own and his savings on the line, the older man has become very frenzied with the success of his favorite football team. Although he denies that superstition has become a part of his game-viewing routine, he has exceeded the label of a 'crazed fan'. Although it does not initially come out, he truly cares for his son, and he soon puts his entire faith in his son's ambitions.My Thoughts This is a film about people. Though the plot itself is somewhat basic, it is the people that flow through it that make it the great film that it is. On multiple occasions, director David O. Russell has been quoted as saying that he doesn't care how the script works out, just as long as the characters are presented in a manner that conveys the script's message(s). Though he had a relative success in Three Kings (1999), the director finally hit the big time following the back-to- back successes with The Fighter (2010) and Silver Linings Playbook. Like many other directors, Russell frequently works with the same handful of actors, and this grouping is quite an impressive bunch. Though he has just begun an undoubtedly promising career, the director has repeatedly worked with Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, and Robert De Niro. If he can keep being at the helm of gem like he has done so far, I cannot see how he cannot join the ranks of the best directorial careers in cinematic history. The acting across the entire cast in this film is one of the best I've seen in a while. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are both brilliant in their portrayal of the complex Pat and Tiffany, and Robert De Niro delivers a performance that does not take over the movie, but it fits perfectly into the supporting aspects of the film. This film received quite a bit of critical attention, and it was nominated for 8 Oscars: Picture, Best Actor for Cooper, Best Actress for Lawrence, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro, Best Supporting Actress for Jacki Weaver, Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Film Editing. Although the lone win was for Jennifer Lawrence, I found Cooper's and De Niro's performances to be very notable. I attribute this large amount of losses to the fact that this particular year in cinema featured a large amount of great films that were based on historical events, particularly Lincoln and Argo. Based on the mission to save Americans stuck in the Iran Hostage Crisis, Argo took home Best Picture, and as for Best Actor category, Daniel Day-Lewis took home the award for his performance in Lincoln. Though I mean this as a joke, it could also be a true statement; who isn't going to vote for Abraham Lincoln? I think that this film brings to the screen a great collection of characters, and I recommend this film for that same reason. Now I must warn you, the language is quite bad. Though the F-words do fly, they fly with purpose. Contrary to some films where curses are used as frequent as punctuation, this film only uses vulgarity when it is necessary to portray strong emotions and feelings. This is a film where you have to stay focused in order to acquire the full experience. Though it may be slow at times, it is the characters that drive this film, not the plot. A bit slow at times, and I have trouble accepting the fact that Pat Sr. would bet on his son's dance performance. I understand that this shows that he is caring for his son and what his son wants, but I found this a little too cliché for such a great movie otherwise.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",8,1,4,16 December 2014
Ocean's Eleven," A veteran con artist, newly released from prison, gets a team of eleven heist members together to rob three casinos
","It's his last day in an orange jumpsuit. The buzzer sounds, and the cell door opens. He is Daniel Ocean (Clooney), an esteemed con artist and heist veteran. It doesn't take long for him to get back to his favorite city, Las Vegas. He meets with his accomplice, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and lays his plan out on the table. There is a vault that holds the money for three casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand, and he wants to take all of it. Both Ocean and Ryan agree that they'll need not only a well-executed plan, but also a heist crew that is as crazy as they are. After putting together a group of 11 men, they get set for the biggest heist on a Las Vegas vault in history, and the craziness, suspense, and humor ensues.In this reincarnation of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, the stars shine brighter than the lights of the city that the story takes place in. With an unprecedented ensemble cast featuring some of the hottest actors of the early 21st century (see above), Ocean's Eleven has had money rolling in based on its poster alone. However, while the casting alone boosts the box office, this film does have great characters, and it's a fun movie to watch. What I loved the most about this movie was the smart, witty humor that occurs throughout, especially within the dialog between Rusty and others. While this film doesn't exactly fit into any Oscar category, and there really is no major life lesson or theme, this movie brings classiness, wit, and style to the big screen with the big stars I felt like the script included some scenes or lines that really weren't needed, and they didn't add anything positive to the story. That is my only negative thought, and this is one of my favorite not-so-serious movies! www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",9,0,1,18 December 2014
Batman Begins," After realizing the corruption that exists within his home city, billionaire Bruce Wayne decides to become a mysterious vigilante
","He's a billionaire. He is the heir to a very successful private enterprise, and he is devastatingly terrified of bats. Ever since falling down into a bat-infested cave, the bat has been the symbol of his dread. Following the murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne went in search of a way to stand up and fight the injustice in his city, living among criminals in Asia. While in prison, he meets a mysterious man named Rah's Al Guhl, who offers him a way to fight the world's corruption through a special type of training. When he realizes that the brand of justice is not the same as his own, Wayne returns to Gotham, and he does not like what he finds. Utilizing the training he had received, as well as the resources from Wayne Enterprise's Applied Sciences division, Bruce puts on the cowl and cape that we know and love, and he sets out to defend the city that his father worked so hard to preserve. The Caped Crusader has appeared in comic books and other mediums for decades, and the quest for a permanent success in a film portrayal was very elusive. Though Batman (1984) was a relative success, the failure in the projects that followed were enough to drown out this spark of triumph. The infamous Bat-nipples and such were too much for comic book geeks and the general public to handle. Thankfully, a new director named Christopher Nolan, who had just come off of a successful project called Memento (2000), took up the reins of the DC Comics icon. With the release of Batman Begins, the once depressingly faulty franchise was up to par with a more contemporary success, Sam Raimi's Spiderman. In contrast to what the previous films in the Batman franchise brought to the screen, this installation brought some major pieces: great themes, realistic action sequences, and depth to the main character(s). With a notably darker portrayal of Gotham's hero, this movie was a breakthrough for superhero flicks, and it has been a heavy influence on those hero movies that followed it. The only aspect of the film that the Academy recognized was the cinematography, which definitely deserved such attention. It was the sequel, The Dark Knight, which grabbed the most attention for Oscar categories. The biggest difference in this Batman movie is the themes. While the previous films tried to capture the cartoonish, comic book essence of the character, this one was as realistic as a fictional hero story can be. Tackling deep themes like redemption, rebirth, and standing up for one's beliefs, Batman Begins is much more than men in tights saying 'POW' and 'BAM'. On a negative note, the acting is not quite up to par with the rest of the film's quality. Though it is not the worst acting in a Batman movie (see Batman & Robin), it is not the most well performed film either. Though this is the predecessor to the best superhero movie of all time, The Dark Knight, I strongly suggest that any interested viewer see this film first, as each of Nolan's trilogy plays off of the other films. Just make sure that you keep in mind that this isn't really as family-oriented as the Marvel movies (Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.). This is the grownup's turn to appreciate the Caped Crusader.",8,2,3,18 December 2014
Unknown," Following a car accident that left him in a coma, a man awakens to find that his identity has been stolen, and no one believes that he is who he says he is
","An American couple arrives in Berlin, and they take a taxi to their hotel. The man is Martin Harris, a biologist in town to attend a summit that intends to unveil a revolutionary type of crop to end world hunger. As his wife goes to check in, Martin realizes that they have left a briefcase at the airport and decides to go back. On the cab ride to the airport, the car in front of them loses control, and the taxi swerves into the bridge wall, crashes through, and shoots out into the river. Four days later, Martin wakes up in a hospital room, and he has lost part of his memory, only aware of his name and his wife's. With no form of identification on him, and no idea where his wife is, he has no way to confirm his existence. After seeing the summit on the news, Martin remembers and goes to the hotel. He sees his wife, and as he goes to approach her, he is stopped by security. He tells the guards his name, and they say he has already come in. Martin presses past the desk and he sees a man with his wife. Furiously questioning the stranger, Martin is shown that this man has a driver's license stating the name Martin Harris, his picture with other scientists, and the wife denies any recognition of Martin. Confused and bewildered, Martin desperately searches for a way to prove his identity, and to find out why his wife denies that he is her husband. The 'lost memory/who am I?' idea is very common in the movie world, and it has become somewhat tiresome to see how much it is used. The most notable success of this concept can be found in the Bourne trilogy, and it was vastly successful in both the box office and pop culture. While this film is not nearly as good as The Bourne Identity (2001) or its sequels, it is not quite as bad as others that have appeared on the big screen. This film was made in 2011, and lead actor Liam Neeson had recently come off of a major success in 2008's Taken, a film about an ex-CIA agent who goes to save his daughter who has been kidnapped while on a trip in Europe. After the success of the film, Neeson showed that he could be an action star, and this film wanted to use that new identity (no joke intended). In comparison to Taken, this film lacks the patriarchal emotion and desire for the daughter's safety, and so it lacks the universal element that was the driving force in Taken. In addition, the acting around Neeson is not quite as good. Though January Jones and Diane Kruger do their best, Jones lacks the emotion, and Kruger lacks the likability needed for her character. Though this film is not meant to be completely realistic, there were a few times where the plot was given a little boost in order for the end result to occur. In this day and age, who doesn't have their driver's license, phone, or (when traveling abroad) passport in his or her nearest reach? Though this film didn't quite live up to my expectations, I did like it some aspects. The editing was great, the cinematography has an intriguing tint to it, and the action sequences are very good. Though his performance surely wasn't worthy of any serious critical acclaim, Neeson does a good job with his character. Lastly, this film has a twist ending. I personally love a twist when it is executed well, and though it is not nearly as good as the Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or The Sixth Sense, this film's unforeseen conclusion is pulled off reasonably well. Without the critical eye, this film is a good thriller, and it is worthy of some attention.www.sportsandcelluloid,blogspot.com",7,1,1,16 December 2014
Raging Bull," A talented yet emotionally self-destructive boxer's life outside of the ring is destroying any chance that he has to be truly successful.
","Right from the start, he's fighting. Fighting in the ring, fighting with the judges, and most of all, fighting with himself. After the first match that we see him in, we see that Jake La Motta is just as much of a fighter with his gloves off as he is with them on, possibly even more so. His home life is very troublesome; with a marriage where every interaction results in an argument, and a brother/manager who only patronizes him even more, being a great boxer is not what he thought. With every winning decision, his life out from under the stadium lights becomes worse. He meets an 18-year-old girl, and her personality is, shall we say, flirtatious in a bad way. It doesn't take long for his jealousy and covetousness of his young wife soon becomes a major distraction, and as the middleweight title gets closer, so does his demise. Considered by most as one of the best sports movies of all time (alongside Field of Dreams, Rudy, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers), Raging Bull is a great film not only about boxing, but also about a man who is a boxer. One major difference between this film and fellow boxing classic Rocky is that the movie shows more about life outside of the ropes than it does inside. With the total screen-time of actual bouts at roughly 15 minutes, the sport is simply the background to the story of La Motta. What this movie truly is about is a man who is unstable in his everyday life, and he struggles to keep himself from ruining his own career. In this film, Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances not only of his career, but also possibly of all time. Famously gaining 60 lbs. to play the last part of this character's story, De Niro's performance as the real-life boxer La Motta brought the very intense story to the big- screen. As one of his two Oscar-winning performances, De Niro turned in everything he had, and came home with the deserved recognition. In addition to the Best Actor, Raging Bull also was nominated for Picture, Sound, Supporting Actor for Pesci, Supporting Actress for Moriarty, Director, Sound, Cinematography, and Film Editing, winning the last one. I personally thought that the sound, cinematography, and directing were definitely worthy of their Academy recognition. This film came 4 years after director Martin Scorsese's successful film Taxi Driver, which also featured De Niro. Like Taxi Driver, this film also incorporates the social ineptness of a man, and how this difficulty has an effect on the people around him. At some point between after 1976, Martin Scorsese had become severely addicted to cocaine, and an excessive dosage one day left him in a hospital room. While visiting his great friend, Robert De Niro brought up the idea of making a film based on a book that he had recently read about an old boxer. Though at first hesitant, Scorsese delved into the story of La Motta, and he made this classic as a result. Now I must remind you, this is a rated R movie, and it is deservedly so. As one may expect, the boxing sequences are pretty brutal, with blood and pain visibly flowing throughout. Outside of the ring, both Jake and Joey La Motta engage in many heated arguments, and the language within these scenes is R-worthy in itself. Though nothing is shown, Jake's wife Vicki is very 'friendly' with people, and we hear about it in pretty specific detail. With these warnings listed, I still fully promote this film. This is truly a classic film, and if you are able to endure the violence and language, Raging Bull is a must-see for anyone interested in cinematic history. This is definitely a film that requires one's attention. It is not a movie that necessarily keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat, and it is more about the story. The pacing is slow at times, and it can lull for a small amount of time. I definitely loved this film, and I wholly recommend this film.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",9,2,2,18 December 2014
The Social Network," The journey of Mark Zuckerberg's invention and establishment of Facebook
","College is a time where every student defines him or her self. It's when many people meet their spouse, some of their closest friends, and when they get the degree that turns into a career. For Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg), his time at Harvard has been less about the classes, and more about his time in front of a computer screen, hacking into the school's database and blogging about his life. We first see him infiltrating Harvard's student directory and creating a site where two students' pictures are placed beside each other, and viewers vote on who's 'hotter'. 22,000 page-views, and many outraged students, later, Zuckerberg is called into the school officials' office, and it is now that we see why he has very little friends. The two friends he does have are Eduardo Saverin (Garfield), the finance genius, and Dustin Moskovitz, a computer programmer like Mark. After witnessing the impressive computer work by Mark, brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss meet with him and propose their idea; a social website featuring student bios, info, and statuses, and they want to call it The Harvard Connection. Mark agrees that he's interested in helping the brothers, and leaves. About 6 weeks later, a new social media site is activated featuring student bios, info, and statuses, and it is called The Facebook. The brothers find this new site, and the conflict of whose site it is, and who deserves the potentially billion-dollar revenue, is launched into actionAs an American teen that has been a Facebook account-holder for about 5 years, I was interested in this film. Facebook revolutionized how our society meets and interacts with each other. Coming into this film, I knew two things. 1.) David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, and Curious Case of Benjamin Button) directs it, so I knew that it would be well done 2.) This was the 'big break' for both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, so I was curious to see what made their performances so good I thought that the actors were good in the film, particularly in the case of Andrew Garfield. The only other role I had seen him in was as Spiderman, and this performance was far better. I thought that Jesse Eisenberg did a great job of capturing the quick-thinking and slightly smug Zuckerberg. The story itself is true, and the truth behind the history of this company is quite emotional. This film was nominated for 8 Oscar categories, and it won a trio of them (Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing, and Original Score). My one negative comment is something that I'm still unsure of. In the movie Mark comes off as very egotistical and pretty cutthroat. I'm not sure if this is what the real man is like, or if Eisenberg's performance is what created this impression. In the case of the former, it disappoints me that one of the richest men in America is pompous and conceited.The run time is exactly 2 hours, but it seems longer than that. While stereotypical college life and the 'lifestyles of the rich and famous' do involve sexuality, I found it to be a little too much for my taste. I also found that the film leaves the viewer with the idea that tricking your business partners and friends out of a piece of the company that they helped you create leaves you rich. However, it does show the moral message that you can have billions of dollars, but you may not have many friends, whether in real life or on Facebook. www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",10,3,4,18 December 2014
