Requiem for a Dream," Where's my gun, noose, and arsenic??
","Yeah, this movie made me want to kill myself.  It was VERY effective in gaining my empathic support such that suicide seemed like the only viable option for most of the characters by the end of the movie.  There was no glimmer of hope for any of the characters by movie's end except for the sweet escape of death.  This movie certainly would put the brakes on any would-be drug abuser, still young and impressionable.  That, especially if you gently fibbed that the movie was based on true events.  I think they'd stop their drug use with a dead halt (along with considerable counseling and support, of course).  Anyway, off my soapbox on that point I must say I'd not rate this movie very highly.  I'm torn, on the one hand it should be seen by *some* people, on the other it shouldn't be seen at all.  So if you're a burnt out highschool student looking to drugs for support, I'd give it a 9/10.  If you're a normal, every day Joe-Blow looking for some kicks, look somewhere else, 5/10.",Null,1,2,6 September 2003
