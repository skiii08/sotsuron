Vertigo," Perhaps the greatest movie ever made. Much better than Seven and Silence of the Lambs
","Vertigo is the best psychological thriller I have ever seen. The acting is amazing, while the plot cannot be told, but must be experienced. In short, this is more complex than Total Recall and a far more complete movie than The Usual Suspects. The Gothic nature of this movie makes it even more scary and challenges your sense of reality from the beginning. If this was a book it would be called 'Wuthering Heights'. If it was real life it would be JFK with all the evidences. This movie demands to be watched over and over again and should be in everyone's video collection. In fact this is not a movie in the conventional sense, rather an autobiography about Hitchcock and the way he views life and his movies!",10,1,3,14 June 1999

Shakespeare in Love," Shakespeare's demise only matches our own!
","Mmmm........ this movie has an exceptional but short and dramatic performance from Judi Dench. Certainly the script was more worked out than Saving Private Ryan. However this movie falls way short of the inventiveness of La vita E Bella (Life is Beautiful) in every department apart from best female actress which should have gone to Cate in Elizabeth. Though the script of this movie was witty in parts, they are not in the same league of humour that is provided by Roberto in Life is Beautiful. The little boy should have won best supporting actor! Imagine trying to do a plot out of the holocaust which is also a comedy,  far more complex that dry humour. In fact, Shakespeare in Love will probably give the wrong view of the great writer to a much younger generation (as there is no one view of Shakespeare). In addition, this movie shows that propaganda through marketing can win a film company an oscar. The company should have advertised La Vita E Bella, instead of this almost average movie. Name any other movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time, this movie can't do either - Roberto can do it with ease. The romance (it should be called LUST) elements in Shakespeare in Love were rubbish and modernised to 1990's ideologies with sodomistic sex scenes without purpose, drama and lacking romance (something that Titanic suffered from as well). If you want to know about romance and the human spirit watch Life is Beautiful and understand that romance is about giving it in the good times and the bad and the willingness to stick with one partner.

Forrest Gump," If this isn't a 10/10 movie I have not seen one!!!
","Some users view this movie as inferior to The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) which was released the same year. Personally, I see that both Forrest Gump (FG) and TSR as the same standard of excellence. Both movies shows contrasting aspects of hope and how to adjust to injustices in the outside world. What made FG a classic and probably gave it the best picture Oscar was not only the special effects throughout the movie, or the brilliant appropriate use of music fitting the era, but the incredible acting and plot device. When I first saw FG I thought it was a good family comedy with immense amounts of surrealism. However after repeat viewing I realised that FG had one of the most thought provoking scripts ever committed to film. There are so many aspects of the storyline that has never left me ever since I saw the movie almost five years ago. Just like Life is Beautiful there is the external and internal images and story in this picture. The external is a family comedy that will make you laugh as many things seem so outrageous. However internally, FG is a movie about drug addiction, child sexual abuse, a true sacrificial love story with one way traffic, how a person can cope with disability without committing suicide, the nature of God when something terrible happens to you, prostitution and so much more besides. Tell me one other movie that can handle these subjects and still make you laugh throughout while telling you important moral lessons?Unlike other so called romance movies like Titanic, FG was not based on lust rather an understanding and fidelity of other persons' characters. If Forrest Gump is a bit dumb he makes up for it with his saint like character. What made this movie tragic is the long time span in which Forrest is in love with his girl and would do almost anything for her and yet she disrespects him because he is mentally disabled, he is not 'normal'. Yet the people Jenny hangs around with are spiritually and morally 'abnormal'. If people can't relate to this maybe it is beyond their understanding and comprehension as they have never been in that position.Forrest may not be able to verbalise the meaning of love, but his actions put 'normal' people to shame and some. Where else in a modern film do you see the hero being rejected by a gril or even genuinely wanting to get married, only in the old classics I suppose!! Forrest always has the hope of a better future, he teaches the audience that you should always have an aim to look forward to and that will help to keep you sane under misfortune, even if it's simply running down the road to owning a business. In addition, the movie shows that no matter what your disability you can still make a contribution to society and other people's lives. If this is not a powerful message I have never seen or heard one. Forrest knows that Jenny is the only girl he has got a chance with to be his wife, which makes the story even sadder as we see Jenny living a life on the edge. Even at the ending we are unsure whether Forrest is really looking after his son, but as long it is Jenny's and she is his,  he does not mind. Maybe this is a blind type of love, but he also loves Jenny like a biblical prodigal sister and he does not realise that he may have AIDS too. However FG gives hope to many millions of people around the world who are disabled and feel socially excluded in society. As the years roll by I still think about this movie which shows aspects of life which are heart wretchingly profound if you look beyond the external window. If this isn't a 10/10 movie I have not seen one.",10,0,2,8 March 1999

American Beauty," Great Movie!!! But should not win BEST Picture! Why?
","I saw American Beauty the other day and thought this was the best movie of the year. The performances of Spacey and Wesley were outstanding; perhaps Wesley like Carrey was robbed for not being norminated. Benning performance can either be seen as over-acting or someone who is trying to make a false face for herself and a makeshift image of success. Nevertheless, after seeing Richard Farnsworth performance in 'The Straight Story' I realised that Richard deserved the oscar if it was just a race between him, Spacey and Crowe. Whereas, Spacey relied upon good camera direction and words to convey emotions, Richard went a step better just by seeing his slow movement across the screen - he didn't even have to talk to convey ideas and emotions and when he did Richard as Alvin summed up World War Two far better than three hours of 'Saving Private Ryan' could ever do. For me this is the best movie I have seen since La Vita e Bella and that was over a year ago!!! This is one of the greatest movies of all time for the following reasons: 1) The acting by all the characters were outstanding, something you cannot claim for American Beauty. 2) The storyline was more thought-provoking as it's the type you will appreciate more when you are adult enough to understand. 3) There are moral lessons here that are far superior to American Beauty.

American History X," One of the most powerful movies/drama ever made - but flaws remain
","American History X has got a combination of great script writing and acting which when combined bring out an incredible drama that proves that anyone can be manipulated into certain ideas and dogmas. When Edward Norton talks from the racist view point there seems to be some truth to what he is saying. This is what makes him really dangerous as he inspires others to have the same attitude towards other people.There were a number of faults in this movie that prevented it from classic status, but it is worth seeing it for the qualities I have already mentioned. 1) At the start of the movie I felt that Norton was somewhat justified to harm and get angry about two black youths stealing from him. He was protecting HIS property, this scene could and should have been different if the movie was trying to convey that violence is wrong and unjustified. 2) The prison scene did not convince me that Norton had converted to a different way of thinking. The prison scene was a great opportunity for character development of both Norton and the other inmates that influenced him. This movie failed in this department which as it turns out was fundamental to the whole story. 3) The ending scene it can mean violence leads to more violence is a cliche I have heard in thousands of other movies including Boyz in the Hood. The movie was much more than a black and white issues as another alternative view of the movie's ending could imply. The movie was not simply about hatred, rather emancipating a person through understanding another person's point of view. Yet the movie ended in cliche and violence. This is not totally a bad thing as it would move some people to think about their actions and consequences, but fails to push the debate along from what other related movies have achieved. Tough not as good or clever as Life is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella), both deal with hatred and intolerance and are well both worth seeing for the acting and script alone.

Saving Private Ryan," Corporal Upham was outstanding!!!
","Many people have talked about this movie in terms of the realistic violence and action throughout the movie. This certainly helps to drag people into the movie, but was not the most stunning thing I saw in this movie. Some people have highlighted the simple, but effective plot as a means to prove that it was not worthy of the title of best war movie of all time. My view was the movie was not really created to have detail plots to confuse people and make them think, rather the movie was about how pictures and images of war can say much much more than words can ever do. We not only get scenes of realistic action, but fundamentally the characterisation of Corporal Upham is one of the best achievements in ANY war movie. Whereas the other characters we have seen before in other similar war movies, Upham was so unique in war movies of any sort that he blew me away. Saving Private Ryan should have focused more upon Upham's character because it was far more interesting and realistic than all the other characters put together. This movie was a character study rather than plot tangles. Upham should not even be in the war, he is not only innocent, but is the moral person in the movie who affects the decisions and lives of the other soldiers around him. Throughout the movie we see his character slowly change and develop to the final scenes that is so full of emotionally realism that he beats other war movie characters. Scenes to watch out for are: 1) When he is left behind and watches his new friends take out a guarded post. 2) When he sits on the steps - absolutely incredible. 3) When he tries to save a German person's life. 4) And the final horrific emotionally scene of realism. And so many besides.The only off-putting thing about the movie is the propaganda concerning giving the impression that America is the best country in the world and saves us from losing the war, when in fact they were just additional help who did not join until Britain was in too much debt to the USA.",9,0,0,26 May 1999

Schindler's List," Very Good, but.......
","One thing about this movie my friend commented upon was the way that emotionally effects are used within this picture. An emotional prop would be the little girl in the red dress, was it there to create emotions through grimmicks? There are other things like that throughout. Otherwise I thought the acting was superb with some character developments. However was this film accurate historically. My friend thinks it was not and was actually a very good form of subtle emotional propaganda! What do you think? I know the director's last work on 'Saving Private Ryan'(SPR) was a piece of American trash only showing how GI's saved Europe - that's manipulating the public and historical narratives, with all this American flag waving rubbish (The Straight Story (1999) tells you more about world War Two than the whole three hours of SPR could ever do!!!).

Titanic," Grand adventure on the high seas
","I would like to say I really liked Titanic in terms of suspense and being in the grand mode of other classic long drama movies like 'Gone with the Wind'. The acting was good and other aspects like social class, hierarchy and set design issues/props was excellent.On the other the hand, the sex scene (though brief) was unnecessary and distracted from the romance element, certainly not following the scenes of other classic older movies of a non-explicit nature. Other post-modern features was the types of language used by Kate Winslet as Rose, some profanity and constant use of God's name in vain. Notwithstanding these problems the movie shows quite impressive what can be done with 100's of millions of pounds.I think that movies that cost that much and makes a sizeable profit should have at least a proportion given to charity for the real people who are freezing to death, are ill or of great need for food.

The Green Mile," Perhaps the Greatest prison drama Ever!
","I don't usually recommend a movie from Hollywood to people who are either spiritually aware or are thinking about spiritual things. However yesterday I went to watch an excellent film called 'The Green Mile'. I won't say too much about it but read on.......The acting in this movie was really realistic and very down to earth. What could of turn out to be another 'Shawshank Redemption' actually was one of the best prison type movies I have ever seen!The basic story sounds like it going to be a violent prison film about a man who has raped then killed two small girls (aged 8). However the movie had a lot more than just that! The key elements that makes this movie so great are: 1) You really start caring for some of the characters that are on death row awaiting to die on the electric chair. Has anyone ever done missionary work within a prison. Then you will know what I mean? 2) The christian element in this movie added a dimension so lacking in the Shawshank Redemption. It's amazing how many people meet spiritual awareness in this environment in reality in America! 3) It shows that even when God gives you a spiritual gift it is how you use it to help others that really counts. 4) The movie shows that a spiritual gift can be a burden more than a status symbol. 5) The movie is also about ageism and what people think about when they reach to a good old age. In this respect it was similar to 'The Straight Story' which I highly reccommend as well.The little bits of sexual scenes were good as well! Personally, I think that with most modern movies they treat sex in the wrong context, have this just added to the picture's quality. However I was very pleased with these scenes because it was in context of HOW God wants sex to be like i.e. within marriage!I also loved Duncan Clarke and he should win best supporting role in the oscars!This prison movie was really thought-provoking and went beyond the stereotypical lines of preaching to people and really made me and my friend think about our own lives.There is a very nasty scene during the movie (perhaps the most horrible I have ever seen), but this just added to the drama and the knowledge that killing people is often wrong as two wrongs do not make a right; and often enough it is people in power that are the evil ones who pick on the poor and lonely.In conclusion, YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW. Tell me what you think and how much did it changed your view about how God sees real criminals trapped on death row in America!RATINGS Direction = 80% Effective throughout with peeks into the past.Acting = 93% All the characters are well acted, especially Duncan Clarke!!!Music = 92% Adds to the atmosphere greatly.Sound + 85% Brilliant spot effects to create a prison environment. totally convincing when 'Old Sparky' is alive and working - really scary!Horrible scenes and words = 83% The love scenes were fine because it was in context and was part of the plot! The violence was expected considering it's a realistic almost documentary style prison drama, however it was not there just to be fantasical. The movie also contain the most horrible scene ever in any film I have ever seen - so beware!!!Editing = 50% This is the weakest part of the film. The beginning should have be shorter, but the next two hours was a milestone in capturing your attention.Plot = 90% Designed for Christians and non-Christians alike. A rare movie that isn't peachy or preaching, but has the subtly to make you think!Hookability = 61% The long introduction makes you want the film to end soon. You may get confused whether this is a comedy or not!Lastability = 96% Once you see a miracle, then every minute of this get better and better and you won't want the movie to end.Overall = 90% Perhaps the greatest prison drama ever!

The Shawshank Redemption," Three tales of hope
","I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.",10,5,9,4 March 1999

Platoon," First person perspective
","Yes. I love watching platoon. There was some great acting and drama going on which was edge of the seat sort of stuff. The elements also played a role (rain etc), which helped to make a convincing movie. Nevertheless, by Oliver Stone using a first person perspective, the audience knew the main character was not going to die, which in turn reduced the thiller nature of the film as we knew nothing serious was going to happen to SHEEN. Saving Private Ryan gave the impression of a real war with enemies and not know who was going to survive. Platoon is a fantastic drama, not about war in itself, rather a character study of the effects of war upon people who are meant to be close to you. The real enemy was within than external. Oliver Stone shows that America can be the enemy with undisciplined soldiers and conflicting leaders which made the movie a classic which it is.",10,1,1,13 January 1999

","Rear Window starts off slow as the characters develop and the romance begins with one of the best screen kisses I have ever seen. The slow motion make it look dream-like, I hope I get kissed that way one day<:-)) The plotting devised is very well constructed with immense amount of facial emotions by Stewart throughout. The slow build up is well worth staying with as it's humourous and at times thought-provoking. As the tense builds, you can feel a nervous thrill running through your system (a similar effect during Arlington Road). Hitchcock has made a wonderful film here and it deserves the praise it gets! Though it is not as good as Vertigo in terms creating atmosphere from beginning to the end. You will appreciate the care and attention to this masterpiece.

But the movie could have been improved if it was longer to show what happens when Truman enters the real world. A parody could have been made between the life of Princess Diane and Truman as the cameras would not be secret anymore and people will see him as someone famous and treat his privacy accordingly in the real world.

The Matrix," One of the greatest movies of all time and WHY!
","When I went to watch The Matrix I thought the special effects were going to be the selling point in the movie... gladly I was wrong. I found out to my surprise that the story and the psychological emotional elements of the story were profound and so thought provoking. The Story (psychologically) you need to think!1) The actual idea and conception of the Matrix is really frightening to the extent that we begin to see that humans who create technology then are enslaved by it(much better than Terminator 2 in storyline). This reminds me of our present situation where computers and genetic engineering is slowly changing how we live in 1999. Science is slowly making us slaves and we are doing nothing about it, we don't even care or notice it but accept it as progress. This movie is an early or late warning signal - will anyone take notice?!2) This movie is about the bible and how Christ saves us from the demons (the men in black with sunglasses). We see birth and incarnation, prophecies of the coming messiah and the search for this messiah. We see sacrificial love and ultimate betrayal (Judas) and people in sin but do not realize it. The fact that many people miss this plot twist in the movie makes me feel very very sad and proves that people are deluded and have not got a working or spiritual knowledge of the bible and what Christ did for humanity. The bringing down of the divine to the enslaved earth. If these points do not create any form of emotions I feel sorry for humanity in general.Rating 10/10PS If you liked this movie which makes you think,  also watch: Total Recall(1990), The Usual Suspects(1995) and particularly Vertigo(1958) by Alfred Hitchcock and ask yourself the question;  where do dreams and nightmares start and end?",9,0,0,30 June 1999
