"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," This movie has it all!
","I will first start off by saying that I try to never let myself get hyped up before watching a movie for the first time. I could not help but get hyped for this movie though. With Shaun of the Dead and Hott Fuzz, I could not wait to see Simon Pegg again. This movie did the opposite of letting me down. IMO it had everything a movie needs to be great. The acting was fantastic and the sexual innuendos were hilarious. Awesome, AWESOME film!!! It had the laughs, and the sighs. I found this movie a bit more serious than Pegg's other films, but it was still without a doubt fantastic. Whether you are a fan of Pegg or not this is a movie that you must see!",8,0,1,8 November 2008
Twilight," It was O.K., rushed/thin plot.
","I took my girlfriend to see this movie, because she is a huge fan of the novel. She told me the movie was pretty close to the actual book, but I could not help feeling that the acting coming from a few of the main actors was just lazy. The guy that played Edward did a great job in my opinion. His acting seemed to be the only bit that had any effort put into it. Oh well. girlfriend was happy in the, which means that I am happy. I would say it is bearable if any other guys out there are considering taking their girlfriends as well. Action sequences were nice, but to short. But in the end as I said before, everything felt rushed. At one point it kinda makes sense, then if feels like what should have taken 45 minutes to occur in the movie only took 35 seconds. Other than that, just expect decent acting from most of the characters, and a thin plot. Everything else is fine though. Hope this helps!",6,2,5,23 November 2008
