Skyfall," Worst Bond Movie
","I love Bond movies. But this was the worst Bond Movie, There are so many things wrong with this movie. Most of the elements of a good Bond movie aren't there. There is nothing in this movie what is expected from a bond movie. No new gadgets, No story ( List of agents for a bond movie and what happened to that list after half way through the movie?) . The climax ( I was thinking am I watching a bond movie or in a wrong cinema ) feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down Scottish house. With the home made defenses and geriatric defenders. This movie may be numerically a box office success but leaves behind a 50 years legacy in shreds. This is by far the absolute worst Bond movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, there are no emotions to be invoked in the viewer (I couldn't feel for any of the characters, not even when M died in the end), there is no main theme - everything just seems to be randomly put together I really wonder how could critic give any rating to this movie.
