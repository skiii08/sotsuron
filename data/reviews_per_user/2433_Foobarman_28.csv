Angels & Demons," 100% lived up to expectations
","Angels and Demons is one of my favorite books, so naturally I expected quite a lot from this film, and it totally lived up to my expectations. The thrill of watching this movie is not one that I often feel when watching movies. I would definitely say that this is in the top 5 movies I have ever watched.Angels and Demons is basically about a Havard religious symbologist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who is trying to help save the Vatican from an old enemy (The Illuminati) who is going to blow the Vatican up (with Anti-Matter) at midnight on the night of conclave and kill 4 Cardinals. He teams up with Vittoria Vetra and some Swiss Guard members, and tries to follow the ancient Path of Illumination which is where the murders of the 4 preferiti Cardinals is going to take place. At the same time he is trying to figure out where the anti-matter canister is and save the Catholic Church.The movie varies from the book a bit (like Kohler and Rocher don't appear, but the character 'Richter' is basically a combination of the two of them), but the basic plot is the same.I truly enjoyed watching this movie and I am definitely going to get the DVD when it comes out. I totally recommend anyone to watch this movie.",10,6,12,25 May 2009
Star Trek," Not nearly as good as it should have been
","This is my first Star Trek movie I have seen. I didn't have high expectations for this movie, so that is why I wasn't really disappointed when the movie turned out to be boring and not that exciting.The bad guys were also portrayed badly, they look like a bikie gang! The film was quite hard to follow. I still don't fully understand the plot. They should have made the movie shorter and the opening scenes weren't really necessary.The movie got a bit better around the middle (in terms of how interesting it is) but then it became boring like the start, afterwards.If you are a Star Trek fan this movie might disappoint you as I went with a fan. He said that the movie wasn't nearly as good as the previous ones.",4,19,28,16 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Just...weird...
","If I were to summarize 'Inglourious Basterds' in one word it would be: Weird. Now you are probably wondering: Good weird or bad weird? Well, both - but mainly bad. I wish this movie was a little more focused. If this movie was more focused on what it wanted to achieve, it would be a lot more interesting and funny.By the way this movie was totally different to what I expected - and that can be good sometimes when it makes the movie less predictable. But in this case it just made the movie something I didn't want to see.Anyway, this movie is about a group of Jewish-Americans who try to scare the Nazis by killing every Nazi they find in brutal ways. Be warned this movie has a lot of blood, killing and violence just for the sake of having more violence. And that isn't a bad thing (at least not for me - what's a war movie without lots of violence?).This movie isn't that bad, there are a few laughs along the way and a few exciting moments but in general I didn't enjoy this film.To sum it up: it is a pretty average movie and I wouldn't recommend friends to watch it.",4,12,28,24 August 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Not a good movie at all.
","This is one of those movies I just don't get. I don't really see the point. Its just not an interesting movie. Yes its not horrible - but its definitely not a movie that I would watch again.To me its just another one of those stupid kids adventure movies. The Harry Potter movies are infinitely better and more enjoyable. They release numerous movies very similar to these and they just aren't interesting or exciting. I'm not sure what the film makers were trying to achieve with this movie, but its pretty obvious that they didn't have high goals for the movie.I'm not sure whether it is just due to a bad plot (then you have to blame the book) or whether it was just made poorly. Either way (or both) the movie is still a very boring and uninteresting try-hard kids movie.I'm sure a lot of people have enjoyed this movie - but I still don't see what is good about it. As i said - its not horrible - but its even remotely good either - so why should you watch it? And the stupid - clich√© happy ending, really annoyed me. I don't mind a happy ending (the Da Vinci Code for instance), but a stupid childish boring happy ending which you can think up in two seconds really annoyed me.To sum it up: its a movie that is not funny, not interesting, not exciting, not anything good. Just don't watch it.",3,0,0,30 January 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Brilliant, a lot better than expected
","I didn't expect this movie to be great, I thought it would just be average but this movie turned out to be excellent. This is a very well made and exciting film.Because I have never watched a X-Men movie before, I found this a bit hard to follow. Other than that the movie was brilliant. The action scenes were spectacular and very exciting (some of the best I have seen in a while).The special effects were great and were used very well. The movie was filmed very well and didn't make it uncomfortable to watch (like some movies). To sum it up: I think this is a great movie which is exciting, well made and enjoyable to watch. My rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.",8,2,4,2 May 2009
Silent Hill," So far best example of game - movie adaptation.
","9/10 rating.Silent Hill is by far the best movie which is based on a game. I previously watched House of the Dead and that was HORRIBLE! The movie is stunningly creepy and does an excellent job at keeping you screaming! The action of the movie was great, and the whole storyline was excellent (thanks to the game though). It was sad how the police officer died and the ending totally creeped me out.This is a masterpiece of a movie - well acted, interesting, creepy and plenty of action.This is the sort of movie that you think about for a while afterwards - unlike House of the Dead.This movie certainly comes within range of some of the best horror movies.",9,0,1,17 January 2009
Scary Movie 2," Worst of the Scary Movie Franchise
","'Scary Movie 2' is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.This movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don't think you will like it nearly as much.",4,2,3,7 September 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," I expected a lot more
",The previous two Matrix movies were a lot better than this one. The action scene's weren't nearly as good as the previous two and the ending was pretty bad. Its a pity they didn't make this movie better as now it downgrades the whole Matrix series.There was too much time in Zion - when they should have spent more time in the Matrix. The final battle was all right but the way it ended wasn't good. I still don't understand it fully! The movie wasn't horrible - but I was just expecting so much more.If your a matrix fan - you should definitely watch this (you don't want to have the series uncompleted) even if the movie isn't great.6/10 - an average movie.,6,0,0,30 March 2009
The Village," Great twist at the end!
","I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. It was scary, intense and mysterious at the perfect times. I was recommended to watch it by a friend - and the movie certainly did live up to expectations.The woods were freaky! And the movie was not just pure horror - but interesting and had a great plot. This is the kind of movie that I want to go and watch it again.The twist at the end - where the Village turns out to be set in the 21st century and most people didn't know, was really unexpected. I love movies with a twist - like the 6th Sense.This movie really deserves the rating I have given it: 10/10.GREAT MOVIE - WATCH IT!",10,3,4,13 February 2009
Knowing," Loved it!
","This movie was quite different from what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be similar to National Treasure (which I liked as well) with Nic Cage going around cracking codes.It was partially about Nic Cage going around cracking codes - but this movie had a horror and mystery theme to it - which made this movie great.'Knowing' is basically about a girl that writes a page full of numbers as her submission to her schools time capsule. 50 years later when they take the capsule out Nicolas Cage (John) realizes that it is a list of dates that for tell when disasters are going to happen. It also shows the co-ordinates and the number of casualties. Though some of the dates listed haven't happened yet...The ending was not what I thought it would be, which is good - I love unexpected endings.I really recommend this movie - and is one of Nicolas Cage's best so far. The plot, casting, lighting and everything was also excellent. Also - I would definitely watch this in the theater - this movie was totally made for the big screen.",8,2,6,28 March 2009
The Orphanage," My favorite foreign movie!
","This is one of few movies I have watched from a different language - relying totally on English subtitles. i usually dislike movies in another language.But this movie was GREAT. It was an excellent horror film which certainly deserves the 9/10 rating I gave it. The whole movie was great and the little boy with the mask was a great horror film 'scary character'.I read about it in a magazine and instantly new it was a movie I had to watch. The plot, the setting and the acting was great. The movie had plenty of frights but the movie was still very enjoyable.The ending was sad - but that didn't take away at all from the movie. It is certainly one of the best horror films of 2007. I didn't watch it in cinema so that probably made it less scary (cinema's play the movie very loud so you really get a fright at some parts of horror movies).I strongly recommend you to watch this movie even if you don't like foreign films.",9,1,2,20 January 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best of the Terminator Series! (So far)
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies. It is exciting, action-filled and definitely well acted. It is the best of the Terminator Series so far. This movie definitely sets a high expectation for Terminaotr Salvation. This movie is one of my favorite action movies ever made.The ending was a sad but it didn't take away from the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger was absolutely perfect for his role. The movie is definitely one you should have in your film collection.It's a pity I didn't watch this in a cinema as that would have made it even better. Action movies are great on the big screen.I recommend this to anyone who loves a great action movie!",9,1,1,23 April 2009
Die Hard 2," Action packed with great use of humor
","'Die Hard 2', like the other Die Hard movies, has the perfect mix of action and humor. Bruce Willis who plays John McClane - the Die Hard Protagonist, once again does an excellent job. This sequel to 'Die Hard' definitely does not disappoint. This movie truly lives up to expectations.This film is basically about a cop who battles criminals because they are going to cause airplane crashes if the airport staff don't follow the criminals' instructions. The ending is brilliant, action-packed and surprising.The great thing about this movie is that it never gets boring. Throughout the whole movie, right until the end, it was exciting and thrilling.I truly enjoyed watching this excellent thriller and is a movie you can watch many times and still enjoy it.",9,2,4,24 July 2009
Quantum of Solace," Good, but Casino Royale was better.
","Quantum of Solace was a good movie. It was fast-paced and action-filled, but I still think Casino Royale was better. This is a movie you just have to watch in cinema. All those car chases and fights - were excellent on the big screen. I can't exactly put my finger on what is missing from this movie - that made Casino Royale better. I guess Casino Royale was just more fun to watch. Don't get me wrong, this movie does definitely live up to the standard of Bond movies and is a great movie. I really enjoyed watching it - but its just a pity that it wasn't that little bit better.At first I didn't like the new bond (I though the old Bond was great and I was adamant I didn't want change) - now, though, I think I actually prefer the new bond.7/10 rating.",7,1,3,15 March 2009
Alien vs. Predator," A movie you can watch over and over again!
","Alien vs Predator is a fusion of two of the best movie franchises ever: Alien and Predator! This movie is better than any movie in the Alien or Predator franchise as this movie combines both. Every minute of this movie is exciting and intense. You can never get bored during this movie which makes it so great. And what a brilliant tag-line it has: Whoever wins... We lose.This movie is about a company that finds an unusually heat source in Antarctica and gathers a team of experts to go down there are investigate. It turns out that there is an old temple located far below the surface and that is the the site of an ancient hunt. Between the Hunters (Predators) and the Serpents (Aliens).Obviously anyone who enjoyed the Alien and Predator series should watch this but I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, battles and powerful creatures. Certainly a movie that you can watch over and over again (like I did).A great movie - 9/10.",9,2,4,20 September 2009
District 9," Certainly a disappointment
","I expected 'District 9' to be a really great movie. The trailer looked great, the posters looked great and I heard good reports about it. But, I must say this movie was a real disappointment. I didn't really enjoy it.District 9 is basically about aliens that come to earth and are forced to live in very poor conditions in an area called District 9 (located in Johannesburg, South Africa). Their spaceship is not able to fly them out of Earth and so they are stuck in District 9. The humans then try and move the aliens (known as prawns) from District 9 to District 10 which is newer and further away from the city making the humans more relaxed. But that is when the trouble starts...This movie is made in the style of a documentary. The plot was great and if they had expanded on that and made the movie more interesting and exciting then this movie would have been great. Which is a pity because I had high expectations for this movie.",4,9,23,15 August 2009
Transformers," Pretty Boring
","I was reluctant to watch this movie, though I decided to see it. I'm glad I didn't decide to watch this in the theater. The movie was boring. The action scene's were mediocre at best, the casting was poor and the plot was bad. It managed a 3/10 because it had a few good moments. Other than that the movie was quite boring.It was also quite childish and a good action movie can't be childish. The age group this movie was aimed at was too young for my liking and that is part of the reason why I didn't like it. Maybe if I was younger this movie would have appealed to me.So if you are a kid who still plays with toys - then this is for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't see it.To sum it up: it is a pretty boring movie but some younger kids might enjoy it.",3,1,3,5 April 2009
The Dark Knight," One of my favorite action movies of all time!
",Batman - The Dark Knight was certainly one of my favorite action movies of 2008. I really enjoyed watching this movie - and I don't like that many action films. It is by far the best of the Batman series and the best of all the Superhero movies.I totally recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to see it. Some parts are hard to follow (like the ending) but it doesn't take away from the movie.This movie is sure to impress. I didn't expect the movie to be nearly as good as it turned out to be. The action scenes were way better than I expected.Although the movie was a bit long - because the movie was great I didn't mind having to watch more of it.The part with the two boats was full of suspense and really kept me on the edge of my seat! So to anyone considering to not watch it: WATCH IT!!!,9,1,3,16 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Great movie - lived up to the standard set by the book.
","9/10 Rating.I really enjoyed watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The movie was enjoyable, thrilling and well acted. It is my favorite of the Harry Potter films.The Order of the Phoenix book was an excellent book and personally my second favorite - so the book set a high standard and the movie certainly lived up to it. David Yates did an excellent job and the movie certainly impressed me.Anyone who hasn't watched this movie MUST SEE IT. It portrayed the fight scene in the ministry between Voldemort - Dumbledore and Death eaters - Order near the end very well. Umbridge from the movie looked exactly as I expected her to look like.Basically this movie is a well casted, well acted, exciting, thrilling movie that will make you want to see it again and again.",9,0,2,16 January 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Good movie, but book was better.
","Rating: 6/10 This is a movie I liked watching but i wouldn't buy the DVD. It was good but not as interesting as the book. The book is one of my favorite books ever and so I had to watch the movie, the movie wasn't as good as I expected though, but i still enjoyed it.For someone who hasn't seen it I recommend you do - and it is a good movie - but it's not one of those movies that when you leave the cinema you know that you are going to buy the DVD.As a Christian I do not find it offensive in any way. Although I am not a Catholic, I know many Catholics and none of them have been offended by this movie.For those people who don't watch many movies and only watch the ones that receive really good ratings then this isn't for you. I think the next installment - Angels and Demons, will be a lot more interesting.To sum it up: it is good but not great.",6,3,6,10 January 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Just plain boring
","Transformers 2 is no better than the first one. Overall it is boring and the plot is bad. Some parts of this movie were interesting but certainly not many. The fights between the transformers were boring and not interesting at all. The only good part of this movie was Megan Fox.This movie could have been made a hell of a lot better than how it was. And the plot is quite hard to understand as well - which certainly didn't help my impression of the movie. There was simply nothing special about this movie. It was just some stupid childish robots walking around which can transform - toddler material.I certainly don't recommend anyone to watch this movie. There are many, many better ways to spend your money, than on this film.I would give this a 3/10 rating.",3,0,4,3 July 2009
Jaws," Intense, exciting and fast-paced: brilliant.
","Jaws is a absolutely BRILLIANT thriller - certainly one of the best thrillers ever made. This is obviously the ultimate shark movie. It is a very intense and exciting film. This is yet another great Steven Spielberg movies - I think Spielberg is one of the best directors ever.It is about a killer shark that killed a few people on a certain beach. Then they hire someone to go and kill the shark - which is a very long and hard process that gets one of them killed and the other two (on the shark hunting boat) almost killed. The great white shark which they are trying to kill is absolutely massive.The last shark attack is quite gruesome and you see a fair bit - but I still think the movie is a PG movie. Just don't watch it if you hate blood and gore.This is definitely a movie that will be remembered and is certainly one of my favorite movies.This is a movie I would recommend to anyone who loves very intense, exciting and fast-paced thrillers.",9,1,3,21 February 2009
Step Up," A LOT better than I expected!
","I watched this movie very reluctantly expecting some stupid, bullsh't dance movie (like High School Musical), but it turned out to be 10 times better than what I expected. I even enjoyed it! Although the storyline wasn't great the action and music made up for it. The beginning got you interested in the movie and the rest was just great.They had the perfect mix of dance and action. Too much dance would mean a stupid dance film and too little would take away from the movie. The acting was surprisingly great considering most of the (dancing) actors do dancing as their main job. The choice of characters was great and the overall production was very good.It was sad when Skinny died - (I think an unnecessary death) but the rest of the movie is pretty light hearted and happy.You might be thinking why I didn't give it a better rating considering the comments - its because i'm just personally not into dance films as much as other genres. If you love dance films then this movie is certainly for you.I think this is a great movie and even if you don't want to see it I strongly recommend that you do.",7,0,0,18 January 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," The Best of the Die Hard movies!
","This movie was a purely great action movie. The suspense and tension in this movie is just excellent.It wasn't one of those stupid action movies that have an excessive amount of explosions and special affects and really no plot. This is not like that at all - an action movie that sets a benchmark for all other action movies.I think the casting for this movie was great, with Bruce Willis and the bad guy and all. Bruce Willis played his role really well - I can't think of a better actor to play John McClane.Unfortunately, I didn't see this in the cinema (I really wish I did considering how good the movie is) - but even at home it was a really great experience watching it. This is definitely a movie I can watch over and over again without getting bored of it - like the Indiana Jones series).I recommend this movie to people who love a good action movie - that is just great to watch.8.5/10 rating.",8,0,1,7 March 2009
The Matrix," Excellent - a movie you can watch over and over again
","The Matrix is a truly excellent movie. Although the movie is a bit hard to follow the brilliant action scenes totally make up for it. This is personally my favorite Matrix movie. This is one of the movies I have watched the most. I bought the DVD - and I think it was certainly worth it.The casting, acting and production of the movie is great. They chose the perfect actor of Agent Smith and Neo. They suited their roles perfectly and did an excellent job. The filming and camera angles were great and made the action scenes as good as they were.Although, I wish the movie was easier to understand (I finally got it after like the fifth time I watched it).This is certainly one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.",9,1,2,1 March 2009
300," Not nearly as good as I expected
","2/10.My expectations for this movie weren't high at all (about 4.5/10) but it turned out to be a fair bit worse.The action scenes in the movie weren't good at all and the rest of the movie was total boredom. I am telling you now, before you watch it - DON'T WATCH IT.I have watched movies which were worse, but the only reason that this movie was better than them was because the general storyline was reasonably good. If they chose different people to make this film it could have gotten the 4.5/10 I was expecting.It's a poorly acted, amazingly boring movie.",2,1,3,16 January 2009
Moon," A stunningly eerie, creepy and dark movie!
","'Moon' (2009) is a brilliantly made movie that manifests on our fears of loneliness and the unknown. This is the best sci-fi movie I have seen in a long time and is one of the best ever made.This movie is about an astronaut, Sam Bell, who is the single human crew member of a Lunar Industries facility on the moon. There is also a computer there to assist him, GERTY. The facility harvests Helium-3 (a very clean energy source and commonly used on Earth in this movie) and sends it back to Earth. Though, near the end of his time on the Moon, Sam is involved in an accident at the harvester and he becomes unconscious. Once is recovers he goes back out to the harvester and makes a shocking discovery which makes him begin to doubt a lot of things.This movie may only have a few characters with only one appearing regularly, but this movie still manages to be very exciting and interesting. 'Moon' has a very eerie and creepy feel to it that I haven't seen in many other movies. The music, the computer, the infirmary and the landscape of the moon all contribute to this. The movie is also quite dark and explores themes of loneliness, fear and helplessness.This is a stunning movie and I recommend everyone to go and see it, sci-fi fan or not. This movie may have seen a very quiet and small release in numerous countries but I wouldn't let that fool you - this is a brilliant movie.",8,0,3,16 October 2009
Valkyrie," A movie you absolutely HAVE to see!
",This is an excellent war movie about the plot to kill Adolf Hitler. I watched it expecting a lot and it definitely achieved over what I expected. It was surprisingly historically accurate.The action and plot was great and so was the acting. I think Tom Cruise did an excellent job portraying Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Although the ending was sad - the movie was still very enjoyable. The suspense of the movie was excellent.This is certainly one of the best war movies ever made. This is so far the best movie of 2009 and is a must see. I enjoyed every moment of watching it.This is a film that is great on the big screen. I totally recommend anyone who loves action and war films to watch this.,10,2,4,25 January 2009
