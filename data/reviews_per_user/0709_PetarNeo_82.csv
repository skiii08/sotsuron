Directing of the movie is magnificent with some different approach to scenes and even some great scenery. 4/4",10,0,2,14 November 2016
The Lobster," Wacky, twisted and amazing movie
","Dystopian futures rarely disappoint in their view of some particular events same goes for this movie. From the start you knew this is going to be twisted and probably interesting movie. Then it started and you feel for the man as he is left with struggle. After some time he is determined to make some friends and try to get out of it. His choices are not the best one but he's trying. Finally he tries to gain trust of the most cruel women there and he succeeds but is left in feelings about things how she handles them and he tries his best not to show them that he is terrified and disgraced with it. It didn't last long and he escapes into woods where are loners. He finds women that is blind and starts relationship and there was nothing but trouble. Ending scenes are amazing as they are in coffee shop and David goes to toilet with knife and scene ends with his preparation to lose his sight, so scene goes blind as women waits for him. Audience is left to decide what is his faith and how much he cares for her. Performance by Colin is amazing as he moves us throughout all different moods and feelings. Very twisty and absurd movie that proves Lanthimos as good film maker. 3.5/4",9,0,2,3 September 2016
Blade Runner 2049," You'll be blown away
","Remembering Ridley's masterpiece from 1982 coming into 2017 as new Blade Runner it had a potential that were in creation for 35 years and it was a magnificent picture that will shame even some of the best movies. Blade Runner 2049 tells a story of LAPD officer that is still picking up old Replicants and comes up to discovery of something greater. Words cant' describe feeling that Blade Runner constantly provides you with as it moves along expanding your understanding of Universe where it's placed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Arrival) comes into this project as a refreshment and brings everything that is so special about his work into this movie with so powerful directing and bring's us to the edge. Alongside Roger Deakins as cinematographer with his ability to capture moments in such profound and beautiful way that will blow even hardest critiques away. Combination of them two and amazing screenplay that they were provided with created this new kind of movie that gives us new insight into film making and how good movies can be. From the start of year with such a great Logan that was dramatic enough to move us all but at the same time entertaining and now with this beautiful masterpiece that is Blade Runner 2049, movies started to adapt and evolve into a pictures that can in every moment be viewed as entertaining and imaginary as much as possible but with emotions and drama is just beautiful to watch. Without any doubt you may say that Blade Runner 2049 is the best movie of 2017 so far and there will be much trouble for movies to top this one. K/Joe (Ryan Gosling) was brought to play an amazing role and he gave an incredible performance proving himself to be a leading man that may lead to being one of the great actors of his class. Deckart (Harrison Ford) returned for his role and as usual he showed us that he can't be forgotten. As for music there is always Hans Zimmer with Benjamin Wallfisch that made a wonderful job in creating certain moods inside movie. You may say Blade Runner 2049 continues to be one of the movies that top it's predecessor and just take off into great universe that it may give. 4/4",10,21,51,5 October 2017
Vertigo," Htchcock's new amazing ride
","John is hired to follow a Gavin's wife, he falls in love with her but after serious turnout events his life is severely changed. In time how you learn more about characters movie gets more and more twisted and it slowly turns into a romance that ends very badly. John and Madeleine fall in love but there is quite tension between them and when Madeleine jumps from tower John's life is turned over. Facing a mental breakdown things get better as he founds women that is very similar to Madeleine.

Ending scene as they climb up in tower on stairs and at top scene he finally was released of his suffering and with love which escaped from his hands and once more he faces same thing. Incredibly well put together and combined into a real psychological mystery which is at moments incredibly intense. James Stewart (John) provided us a one of the greatest performances ever. His doubts and fears combined with love and emotions that drive him all around gave his character something special. Kim Novak (Judy/Madeleine) was also amazingly great with so much emotions, charm and love. 4/4",10,2,4,11 December 2016
Scarface," Just fight and believe
",Powerful story about a man that decided to kill for his better future and his morality was brought to question but throughout movie it was obvious that you need to stand behind your thoughts and keep doing what you think is best. You will always be judged but Pacino character just showed us that is a man with great principals and that he has big morality but doesn't like to be bossed or played. Incredible plot that shows us a mans path from very low point in life to getting almost on top and then falling down in this case being killed. Plot is incredibly written with a lot of development in characters that later on show us their determination in doing something. With a lot of violent scenes that are always brought by our bad characters and are shown in many scenes. Pacino provided one of his many great performances and just gives us great experience. 3.5/4,10,1,2,14 October 2016
Requiem for a Dream," Quite powerful story
","Well this was a nice experience. Story is nicely told and shows us how life can be changed by something so little but so powerful. Addiction drags their lives in different path then it was before. Those flashbacks or whatever they're called are not necessary. Four lives four different paths and endings. Movie was strong and put us directly in struggles of characters as they try to do their best to keep themselves sane and high. The thing about mother is on shaky road, doctor prescribes four different medications but they are probably the same only thing different is dosage as is written on them and he does that easily without thought some people might start to use them all at once as she did. After a while she got addicted and got crazy just like that but there is thing that she wanted to be famous so that destroyed her easily because she was not fit to take it just like that. Addiction that went towards sweet went on medications and it was worse then before. Movies shows us power, struggle, expectations, need and greed and it does it in unique way. 3.5/4",9,0,1,1 September 2016
The Finest Hours," Inspiring story
","You should never underestimate the power of nature and sea as was quite nicely shown in the movie. It features couple that are planning on getting married but his job is very dangerous and it's obvious that her feelings are very shaken and that she is going through horrific time waiting and not knowing what is happening to him. Some of the characters are very poorly developed and after a while it creates this sense of not knowing thing that we probably should know. Shots of tanker from both perspectives are magnificently shot specially scenes when they all flew in mid air with impact scenes. It is obvious that crew is giving their best to survive this in hope that someone will rescue them. Finally Pines character was chosen to lead rescue mission and on his way it it powerful and exciting ride on the oceans and big waves, with some of the very interesting shots, for instance when boat dives and just keeps breaking those powerful waves. Also you are able to sense that they are driven by adrenaline and their will to save everyone. After they returned safely rescuing 32 sailors it was a huge relief to everyone. 3/4",8,1,1,26 September 2016
War Dogs," Great story ended badly told
","Movie started with narrating everything and it kept it through movie that is was very bad. Scene introductions with quotes is not what you do in movies, except if you are one great story teller and you got powerful writing skills, instead you should just let the movie plot flow. Everything from meeting two friends up to their partnership is very lame. From bunch of so called fun moments there are just few of them worth real laugh and Jonah laugh in the movie starts to be annoying after a while. Some of dramatic moments with Iz are nicely played and showed the power of their lie. Best scene of the whole movie is when they run guns in Iraq, it was the only moment that was very funny but at the same time full of action and tension. Acting was on place, Teller did it very well as he had little bit more dramatic character, Jonah tried to make it funny but ended somewhere in between. Cooper playing bad guy is a nice catch as he did not disappoint. It seemed that movie tried to be better with comedic approach to subject. Great story and not so good story telling of it. 2.5/4",6,6,11,7 September 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Disaster that proved human is the most violent killer of nature
","It changed lives of many people and caused greatest catastrophe, so now we got a movie that is trying to provide us a experience what was like on Deepwater horizon during that horrific period of time when everything was just falling apart and humans were just there to witness the power of nature. They did one hell of a job showing us in all that panic how everyone got kicked very hard and some even died from power of disaster. Mark was absolutely magnificent in his role portraying one of the greatest heroes on platform. Kurt also beautifully characterized Jimmy showing us how important he was also. With some funny moments movie just kept preparing you for the one of the worst and most powerfully shown disasters on screens. Bringing that moment of horror and pain took maybe a little too long. Then it happened and it was the most painful thing to watch for almost full hour, just sensing all the pain that those people were having and struggle in keeping everything running with minimal damage. Some of the great scenes were shown when force of nature pushes back to people and it just destroyed everything. Purely horrific and most brutally scenes with all 3.5/4",9,0,1,10 October 2016
In Bruges," Very interesting movie
","At the beginning you know that they are bad guys but you ain't sure how bad. Later on when you find out it just keeps you amazed. They are very violent but seem calm and like normal people. Acting is amazing, the are three powerful actors and they performance just lifted movie up. Doubt and friendship between Farrell and Gleeson characters is amazing as they go through tough time in Bruges. Intelligently written screenplay keeps this movie as one of the better in Crime area. Colin is very strong actor as he proved it also here as struggling with killing of a child. After their boss comes at them it's just chaotic and violent as he's pursuing Ray through Bruges. After finally shooting Ray he also shot a boy and in believe that it's dead he takes his life. That is a powerful thing to do. Very twisty plot but it makes movie even better. Ending is moving as Farrell's character is in ambulance and going to hospital but audience has no idea what is going to happen to him as we are left to choose his destiny by ourselves. Brilliant writing and screenplay is done by McDonagh. 3.5/4",9,1,2,2 September 2016
Chinatown," Amazing movie
","No doubt Chinatown is a superb movie with some great scenes. It kicks of with tension between Mr. Mulwray and people of LA. Then it turns to mystery and all round investigation. Jack Nicholson performance was fantastic, he deals with all kind of stuff and tries to figure out what is going on, after a while he figures it's a large thing. As his character is learning new things it realizes it's not good and there are a lot of things that were not supposed to be found out. His involvement was to great in all that it was inevitable something bad is going to happen as we saw at the end. He (Nicholson) just kept providing one of the performances that Hollywood would remember him for it. Movie writing is astounding with dialogues and creation of scenes that are memorable. As plot kept going movie was getting more and more tension and even some disturbing scenes. There is also a great performance by Faye Dunaway showing us she is also capable of creating memorable character. Movie has proved it's greatness with 11 Oscar nominations and win at best Screenplay. 3.5/4",10,1,3,8 September 2016
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Great
",This one is the most silly and most funny movie in every possible way from such great scenes to unexpected moments. Brilliantly written dialogue proves once more that Monty Python guys have something different from others but unique and so great that will get you in tears from laughing. Sarcasm and making fun of things must not be taken hardly but with this great way of putting things it never gets boring and always gives you something new to look for. Even when it feels like it's going to be serious in part of second it turns into a huge joke which will keep you wondering what next they have to prove how magnificent they are. Only thing that was over limit was scene with spaceship and it was somewhat fun but it seemed like dull idea and finally movie could go without that easily and still be great. Idea was quite original but how they did it was not so good otherwise everything was pretty original and fabulous. 4/4,10,1,2,16 December 2016
The Big Lebowski," Shut up Donny
","Without doubt one of the most influential movies of 90's. Some of the created scenes are so remarkable and memorable you will remember them for it's profoundness, comedy and repeating dialogue. Coen brothers created one of the most interesting comedy/mystery movie that literally is for anyone who appreciate creation of unpleasant and tense but in the same time funny scenes. It's fantastic how Coen brothers managed to create such a powerful movie from simple fact that somebody peed on Dude's rug and how all development started at getting some compensation for rug. Jeff was a perfect cast for Dude as he show us skills of great acting. Walter Sobchak played by Goodman is one of the funniest characters every created as he brilliantly portraits his and does probably best role of his life in comedy. Intelligently written and created dialogues that radiate with comedy and seriousness. Capability of creating interesting scenes that Coen brothers are able to do is not easy but they are doing it perfectly. 4/4",10,0,2,16 September 2016
Train to Busan," Kicked off brilliantly and then slowed down
","From thought about zombie movie you would remember World War Z or Walking Dead but now you have Train to Busan that is strong, powerful, dramatic and great. After introduction to main characters it almost immediately switched to dramatic and horrific zombie attack. As the train goes it all went down rapidly, with attacks and spreading of zombies through train it's pure horror and violence. Some of very impressive scenes were in the movie like one when zombies are chasing the train and grab it creating a long line of them holding onto it. There was also a character that was wisely put in the movie a perfectly used later at the end of it, as guy that seemed like homeless sacrificed his life for pregnant women and Soo- an. Movie also showed in some scenes it's dramatic aspect of it where sacrifices were made. There was also a couple of things that shouldn't be like that for instance CEO Yon-suk that acted selfish in couple scenes. Movie was overall great experience as it offers more than pure horror but also psychological aspect. 3.5/4",9,1,7,16 September 2016
Citizen Kane," Magnificent or not?
","Movie focuses on our man Charles Kane that was taken as a boy by a wealthy man and had opportunity to became what ever he wanted but instead of hopes that everyone else imagined he would be, he ended as a leading man of New York Inquirer. Whole movie spins around last word that Kane said which was Rosebud and throughout movie a man is getting stories about Kane and everything that he did. There is a lot of tension and mystery in the movie as plot goes with some incredible dialogues but after some time movie starts to feel like it's going to take forever to get even slight evidence of what really matters in the movie. How time passes it is evident that our leading man has changed very much and he just wants to be understood but everyone is leaving him slowly and it is killing him. There are some hits of what Rosebud might be because of globe with snow inside it brings memories from his childhood and that it had to do with time when he was still with his real parents and in final scene you are revealed that while his snowboard is burning down that was the mystery. It is incredible movie making and script writing alongside with some great shots taken but that doesn't compensate for very long and at time boring and meaningless scenes. 3.5/4",9,1,2,1 November 2016
Memento," Absolutely savage
","Leonard is trying to find killer of his wife but considering he has a short-term memory loss that makes things very difficult so he has to overcome a lot. Complexity of the movie as it goes starts to feel easier but everything that you learn from storytelling makes new questions. Teddy is cop that is helping Leonard in everything that he needs in finding mysterious John G. Natalie is woman that under all circumstances met Leonard and used him to help her deal with her problems and in return did a simple thing for him. Sammy reference from the beginning was incredibly mixed in whole movie. Editing of the movie and how it proceeded was incredible considering that storyline was very complicated but with all things that you learn it got brilliant. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano did a fantastic job in playing their characters and how movie was put together they all had some mystery until you learn it when it all comes in one place. Praise to originality of the screen writing idea, original short story by Jonathan Nolan and finally incredible directing of Christopher Nolan. 4/4",10,0,2,18 December 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Disposable movie by Lucasfilm
","After many years Death Star has been finished and now Galen Erso's daughter Jyn heads on quest to get a plans for Death Star so it could be destroyed. Rogue One is an incredible ride both visually and from storytelling point of view with many great characters put inside and great Whitaker in his seriousness but also emotional performance and somehow it managed to fade away towards the end. There was a ton of characters just put into movie and as time passed they all fitted and proved how worthy they were but Felicity has totally stolen the show and give an incredible lead in new beginning that ended probably too soon. There was also K-2SO which was funny to have him around and guys like Cassian who helped Jyn in everything, Bodhi Rook that played pilot which was sent by Galen and after proved to be a great ally. Thrilling ride was when all action scenes started then came all amazing visual scenes and some of the greatest moments of movie were there also destroying done by Death Star were absolutely miraculous. There was a lot of details and too many things put in the movie and after end came it felt like everything just was in vain even though it was amazing. Darth Vader scenes were also one of the most intimidating but at the same time beautifully managed. Directing at some points failed but considering overall feeling movie served it's purpose and it seems only like it was made to be entertaining which it was and to make some money for film makers which also will probably do. 3/4",9,1,7,21 December 2016
Passengers," Oh boy, how did they do that
","So movie could be separated in three different categories as it moves along. Firstly visually movie looks superb, it really shines all the way around and it looks really futuristic and advanced. After Jim wakes up and up until the moment it turns into a romance it was quite interesting to look around and see how a person deals with loneliness. So year has passed and now he fell in love with a Aurora and there is idea of waking her up, so he did that and now movie instantly become a romance. As they slowly fall in love with each other and they are doing everything together and year has passed Jim decides to propose to Aurora but after he leaves things go down. Android that is bartender told Aurora she has been woken and now they continue to live their lives separately. There are some hints that ship is failing slowly and this is third genre that kicks in. Thriller that now moves along is quite not interesting and it just wants to be more dramatic, more visually better but it was not even smart. Ending of the movie when everybody actually gets awake is pretty nice and it has some lightness inside but considering everything before it was too many trouble to achieve something like that. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt were fine. They just did their job in doing best and that was it. 2.5/4",7,2,4,8 February 2017
Hostel," It was bad
","There was a partial joy considering that man like Quentin Tarantino offered some help around the movie but that was not enough to save Eli Roth's movie from a disaster that it is. Journey around the Europe is going really good but one bad decision will change it all and that decision is next place that they will visit. Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) came all the way from USA to see Europe and pick up a friend alongside on journey Oli (Eybor Gudionsson). After having ton of fun in Amsterdam they are persuaded to travel to town near Bratislava and there will horror for them and horror for audience start. There was a constant growth of tension and seeing them party and enjoy themselves it started to fell a little boring considering we are watching 1:30 horror movie with 45 minutes of story telling without horror on sight. Then after Oli disappears it was obvious something is wrong and he are flashed with his head on stick giving us sense of what might come. Actually there was some hope for the movie until horror came on sight and it was the funniest and the lousiest horror from a minimal budget movies without real horror and without any anticipation at all. Every scene inside old factory building is badly placed, horribly shot and directed that it looks like some comedy that that turned bad but is still funny. Nice try to make an horror movie with some story behind but considering how ridiculous it looks and even something like this that was put to people to see is offending to horror genre because of it's bad and not scary or terrifying or horrible or at least fearfulness scenes. It looks like a home-made badly written movie and it was supposed to end even before it started. 1.5/4",4,1,2,4 April 2017
Green Room," Full of surprises
","Movie started fantastic as you get to know main characters and their journey, troubles and finally one bad decision that made this movie great. As band got to this place where they are performing you get some creepy feelings about everything. After everything and when they found out guys killed girl it all went down. They found themselves in the room with guys that got gun and they can't leave, they are left with feeling it's not going to be good for them and they are all scared. Then Stewart's character arrives and he turn out to be this brutal man. When group overpowered guy that was holding them there it was obvious there are going to be some bad stuff. Scene with cutting hand is so brutal and painful. After that this get so violent and brutal and it just keeps going till the very end of the movie. Dog scene where it murders guy it just pure horror. Of course there was a couple dumb decisions made by the crew but that is not such big deal despite everything else. Most memorable performance of Stewart as we get to his power in acting. Movie was a mad experience of horror and killing scenes. 3.5/4",9,1,3,16 September 2016
Knives Out," Rian does it again
","Saying that Rian Johnson is a great film maker is understatement. It seems like he just understands all aspects of movie telling and presenting a story that will give him a great opportunity in future to make more movies like this and offer us a lot more enjoyment out of his work.Agatha Christie style of mystery wrapped with great sense of humor and stunningly strong cast will keep you seated for all times and make you to think and develop ideas while at the same time offering something new and fresh to follow and change pace, take turns and finally arrive with satisfying ending.A murder mystery that will turn out to be more than what catches the eye and make a great use of all main stars, giving them a decent time on screen to make all wonders and suck us into their lives.Rian's original idea and his modern approach to this modern day mystery with amazing production set and design that will make others look cheap and his brilliant idea of humor and comedy that blends fantastic into the plot of the movie and the one last and final riddle that feels like love letter to all murder-mystery films and tries to make it smarter.Cast of the movie is also unbelievable and we can only say that all of them offer something that makes it great and creating of modern detective in Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) into Poirot-esque character makes this movie one of the greats of 2019's. 3.5/4",9,2,4,15 March 2020
Juno," Unique experience
","Juno is sixteen year old and after she discovered she is pregnant things go in a lot ways. Movie is very powerful and will give a new view on many things and how teenagers may be able to process things. Paulie is Juno's best friend he shows us a great insight into a mind of teenager being aware of his actions but in the same time loving towards Juno. After changing her mind and deciding not to abort, Juno decides to give baby to a family that really wants it without knowing how things are going to be tough. Being so young it may seem weird and getting too many attention that is unwanted Juno starts to get in touch with Mark, a man who will adopt child, finding herself and him with many similarities in tastes. That led to emotional change inside him but also in her without realizing how inappropriate their friendship has become. Mark deciding to leave Vanessa shook her up but with good will of Juno she decided to leave child to Vanessa anyway. Juno realized alongside with Paulie that they love each other and that their life will be happy together. This is very emotional movie with some great dramatic moments that were filled with sadness but on the other hand it has a comedy in many scenes considering recklessness of Juno and her father also. Movie is amazingly written but directing of the movie was fine and some characters got too many screening time but had an ability to contribute to story greatly. JK Simmons and Ellen Page were incredible in the movie but sadly JK didn't got many attention but every scene that he is in was great. 3.5/4",9,0,1,29 December 2016
The Hateful Eight," Not the best but maybe second best QT movie
",One more absolutely amazing movie written and directed by Tarantino. Seriousness and violence of all characters is so amazing and he manages to keep us interested all the time. Quentin keeps making his own movie world of amazing characters that are well developed and makes a great movie environment. Westerns could be something that we could see him making to the end of his work as movie director. With his humour and shooting he shows us his signature. While watching movie we just keep waiting moment when everything is going to get unsolved and Tarantino manages to keep us all anticipating that moment and bringing it up simultaneously. Daisy is perfectly bringing character up and at the end she shows us what she really is. At the end Mannix and Warren are showing us how bad ass they really are. Morricone has shown us how talented he is in making fantastic original score for movies. 4/4,10,1,3,30 August 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great tale of two friends
","Butch and Kid after couple of troubles get to organize a gang and went out robbing trains but meanwhile as they find out they are being followed, they go on a run for days and finally decide to leave for Bolivia. Story of Butch and Kid was well organized and always put something new to keep things interesting all the time. It had a great action sequences that are followed by some interesting story and subplot that was something to look forward to. At points in the beginning scenes when they are escaping and going through wilderness it felt like there was to much scenes of that and it felt like it could have been shorter. Etta is women that went with them to Bolivia and she was comfort for both of them and it gets weird how they manage their relationship between them. In Bolivia they decide they could rob banks but after some time Butch wants to get rid of that and lead a normal life. It didn't last long and they returned for last one rob and determined to return to USA they got recognized and now whole army is after them. Last moments of the movie are spectacular with many violent and shooting scenes and as they fight with them they begin to believe they are winning. Final scene when they run out was a very nice touch to end of story. Originality of the movie and script is at point and there is a great deal of investment into westerns in the movie and also cinematography is insanely good. Newman and Redford proved they are strong characters. 3.5/4",9,1,2,13 January 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Crazy war comedy experience
","Stanley Kubrick war comedy just shines in all colors that you can imagine, as it provides audience with twisty situations, funny conversations and some scenes where you feel all tensions and worrying. As movie keeps going it amplifies its impact and keep bringing more and more tense with questioning of what is going to happen and is there really treat such as Doomsday weapon. Creating some of very uncomfortable scenes that tend to bring just pure laugh with their seriousness. Towards the end Dr. Strangelove keeps to be in the center of attention as he delivers his ideas about what could happen and what to do with his serious determination but at the same time so comedic and physical movement and trouble with his arm. Also constant shifts towards Fuhrer are so funny so you can't help but laugh when such thing happens. Yet another brilliant movie by Stanley Kubrick that brings us happiness. 4/4",10,1,2,22 September 2016
Suicide Squad," Definitely not as bad as critics say or is it?
","It's new and it brings a lot of heroes so you must make some compromises if you want something like that to work. Way Ayer did it was probably one of best ways and only problem was main villain and his lover. Movie had to be made at certain date so director scraped some things and put them together. Deadshot is may little too Smith but hey Harley ain't nothing more than Harley and Margot played very well with some over the top moments. Balance between seriousness of DC universe and some light put inside is always good thing to make audience entertained. Enchantress seems too powerful to be taken and tricked so easily but Harley is unpredictable. Flag looks very sentimental but at the same time so 'badass' you got to wonder about that. Joker, what is there to be said except we saw a too little of him. Jared is exceptional actor that is capable of creating very strong characters and he did pretty good job but evidently Ayer didn't put too much of him cause t was going to cost probably little more. Light, fun, strong, violent, sad, powerful, book example villain and mixed characters but after all it shows us maybe there is hope some day we'll be so excited about new DC movie. 1.5/4",4,0,2,31 August 2016
Doctor Strange," It takes down every Marvel movie
","After seeing trailer it was like this could be some new powerful story and it definitely was. Doctor Strange is a real doctor that had an accident and in his disability in operating anymore because of his hands unable to keep still in desperation he turns to The Ancient One. It changed his abilities and it was amazing to see how he just keep getting stronger. Marvel did a great job and easily explained his constant growth of power with his learning and photographic memory that allows him that. Fights between Kaecilius and protectors of Earth is just amazing, CGI is absolutely mad and crazy good with all changing of world it just magnifies everything and creates this insanely good scenes. Dark side scene were Strange is trying to drive it mad is very good and very clever. Benedict was absolutely great as he plays Strange with so much power, emotions and it was incredible. Mads as a main villain is perfect, he is such a good actor and has proved it but he lacks of more movies made but with his talent he could be one of greatest actors. Movie is absolutely hilarious with just enough comedic stuff inside and great plot. Only thing setting movie down is some of the characters felt like they were left behind and some of the CGI scenes may seem confusing with all that world altering scenes. This is one big hit for Marvel with great character introductions. 3.5/4",9,3,7,5 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," It will make you explore deepest thoughts
","There are always new ways of exploring crime stories and Three billboards goes in such directions that you could probably never imagine. Story of Three billboards explores human nature as it finds itself trapped in mystery and missing answers, which will show us how far individuals are capable of going to get peace and satisfaction over pain and grief. If you stop asking yourself and keep pushing toward better and healthier state of mind without any satisfaction you will face how you go mad and so Martin McDonagh creates story in such fashion that main character is strongest person and is capable of provoking and harming everybody that doesn't want to help her (Mildred). Mildred (Frances McDormand) is the mother that seeks answers and keeps pushing everybody around her as far it is possible and with doing so (Frances) gives a powerful performance of strong women that will melt and destroy them all if they try to defy her. Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Dixon (Sam Rockwell) are two officers that are being influenced most by actions of Mildred and it was pretty horrifying to see how they will cope with such pressure. Sam Rockwell is giving us one of the most honest performances as he turns completely from inside out. Martin McDonagh is an absolute master in creating difficult situations that can also be explored in his previous movies such as 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' and continues to write and whole story that will suck you in as easy as you drink your drink at movie theatre while looking Three Billboards and wonder how actually good is he as movie maker. If you love crime drama genre you will absolutely fall in love with this one and it is easily one of the best movie this year because it will make you think about everything that has happened and try to evaluate how is it to deal with all of it which also gives a huge philosophical characteristics. 4/4",10,4,8,26 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Well ...
","There is always fascination with movies that manage to capture real sense of what they want to portray and how to show us their charcters in battle over their good or bad, right or wrong, but to go into a universe that was once delightfully created and experience this kind of pain while watching Rise of Skywalker is frustrating. 30, 40 years ago we had a balance that Star Wars provided and now we have a ship full of holes that is meant to sink, but it doesn't seem like anybody cares and that is even worse thing.Leaving the theatre speechless to monstrosities that have been shown on screen and feeling like maybe it's just me but then realising it's everybody around, it's like everybody doesn't even care about anything. They jsut want to see thing burn, explode, flashing lights all over, pointless scenes that inspire no tension, fear or any sort of feeling, you just sit there and watch like motionless human. To say you have to have a little imagination and spend a moment or two to actually remember is absurd, because you are treated like: 'Don't think, just watch' and it just doesn't work beacuse there are people that care and love to see movies, movies ment something to them, maybe even helped them discover something about themselves.The Rise of Skywalker feels like it shoud have been 3h+ long and have full scenes, beautifully choreographed, with meaning and sense that provides us satisfaction of watching something that we actually love. Instead it's 2h 20min of chopped scenes, that will drive you to boredom and then when you are there will drop you a piece of dialogue that will make you wonder how is it even possible to make it like that.In all fairness it is not bad but it is horrendous how lame and unimaginitive it is with constant trying of giving you feel of melancholia. Somehow it just doesn't work, Rey, Finn, Poe all seem like they don't care, they just weant to move but they actually don't care about anything and there isn't much to care given what they are working with. Same goes for Kylo played by Adam Driver, but at least he is trying his best to work something out and fails at the end.CGi looks amazing and how they make it on screen, with so much effort but are so unimaginative that we need to look at something and just feel nothing. All blows, thunderstorm, water and all the created thing to improve cinematography are absolutely great.Making a movie just for sake of making a movie or sequel or prequel is absolutely riddiculous and show never be done, but they just don't care.It's just bad, bad movie that will maybe make money and make a lot of people angry for watching it, but it all comes to money. Everybody wants it but everbody in long run will not have it, those who learn on their mistakes will and those that make same will not.Beautiful CGi followed by dull dialogues and story with overall feeling of nothing is the best description of watching The Rise of Skywalker. 1/4",3,18,30,19 December 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Ben Affleck proves his skills and gives a great ride
",After girl goes missing pair of detectives goes in thrilling ride with some incredibly heavy experiences and consequences. Movie was very well crafted and throughout whole movie it tries in very strange way to resolve everything and pushes you only information that leads in one direction. Sometimes it made you forgot about everybody and then suddenly drops them in middle and now all focus is on them but then it fails in some of tricks. There are some seriously incredible scenes and it was just pure gold from the moment when Patrick enters house and in the end shoots child molester. How they managed with all information that they had and how they were solving case is pretty good but it was at times hard to watch but then they throw some incredible scene just to get you focused again. There was too many characters to get deeply to know them and to set an opinion but then it was very twisty and it was nice. It was also incredible to see how our characters struggle mentally and with a lot of doubts. Material for the movie is seriously great and combined with performances that are on top you get a great movie. Casey Affleck was Patrick and he was incredibly moving and his dedication in getting everything straight was truly great. Michelle Monaghan as Angie was also amazing as she is not afraid to show emotions but also how much she wants to help. Ed Harris was Det. Remy and he was totally tricky and his portrayal was magnificent. Amy Ryan was Hellen a mother of child and she did pretty good job as did Morgan Freeman in role of Cpt. Jack Doyle. 3/4,8,0,1,4 December 2016
The Godfather: Part II," Brilliance of highest volume
","After seeing part I, feeling was what can they do to make this one equal or almost as good as the first one but they did it almost perfectly. Movie as time passes kept you on many fronts following everything that Corleone family is doing and then puts you a great deal of excitement with so many great and tense scenes. It provides an amazing experience with story telling point of view but also from character actions that constantly show us how they evolved and became one of the greatest and most dangerous people. Absolutely most memorable scene is when Vito (De Niro) is following Don Fanucci on top of the buildings and jumping from one to another and then finally get to his home and gets a gun goes in hall to wait for him and after he arrived it was absolutely magnificent scene with his killing. Amazing story told by Coppola with fights in family outside family and just beautiful performances by our two men in leading chair. De Niro showed us his passionate and deep characterization of Vito and got us a performance that amazing. Pacino as always gets us a magnificent inside in his character and reminds us that he is one powerful actor. Moving, strong, deep, magnificent, violent, beautiful. 4/4",10,1,2,30 October 2016
Nightcrawler," Reinventing the movie genre
","Honestly this movie provides something that others don't and that is why it is very special even after first watching and re-watching it years after is has all bad substances put in right place to make it gore, violent, dark, inventive and mesmerizing to follow.Dan Gilroy critique on modern day journalism and news is one of the best pieces that you can wish to watch if you haven't seen it already. Captivating human nature as it absolutely is and making it even grittier, bloodier and absolutely nuts in realistic way.As we wander with Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) on his night journeys looking for opportunities that will make all those light-hearted sick and even go beyond what seems to be reasonable but you will just be sucked into watching because it is amazing in every single way. From compelling story to amazing acting and brilliant photography.Gyllenhaal's character Louis is character that might not offer you compassion but will push you to limit and make you wonder about how society perceive stories and tales of black chronic that is all over us, but it makes us wanting to see more and craving our attention for such drama.Somehow all that gore and bloodiness moves our focus from Louis and then he is thrown back in front of us so it keeps you reminded of his state of mind. He might be presented in villainous way that is constantly opposing healthy state of mind but makes you trust him because of ability to persuasion.Gilroy's Nightcrawler is one of greats that 2010s offer and will be on must see lists. His way of presentation, photography, gripping storytelling, directing that has some of the great scenes to pull you in will make you wanting more.Gore, dark, mesmerizing. 4/4",10,0,0,15 March 2020
Léon: The Professional," Amazing
","After befriending a young girl that lost her family and violent shootout Leon takes girl on a different path in her life that changed his from the roots. Relationship between Leon and Mathilda developed in a very strange way as she fell in love with him but he was trying to remain focused on his job. Story has a great continuity and story goes from violent to emotional and more psychological to extremely violent. In the way of everything and as Mathilda learns more and more about weapons and killing, Leon more and more changes and tends to become emotional. That changing in their personalities was incredibly told and overcame age difference showing how humans are incredible and how they are capable of changing. Last shootout scene was incredible, extremely violent and brutal leading to final sacrifice of Leon and killing himself and man that ruined Mathilda's family and all because she gave him something that hasn't felt in many years and that is love. Reno was incredible in the movie, as he isn't afraid to show emotions but also remaining extremely tough. Natalie Portman was just amazing as she is charming and tough but also incredible loving. Oldman played dark character and he was very good. 3.5/4",10,1,1,24 November 2016
Justice League," It will amaze you and disappoint you
","Looking back two years and now seeing this will make you wonder is there hope for DC because they decide not to change anything and constantly get the same result in movie. Is it because of Snyder (Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Watchmen) who maybe isn't good enough option for directing the movie or is it maybe because of hype that never gets to reach it's true potential we will maybe find out when Matt Reeves gets us a new Batman movie. As it goes with Justice League there were some pretty good things and some that maybe should have been taken more devotion to magnify them. From the start plot seemed like it had some potential with us seeing Batman gathering team to save the world from upcoming threats and then at some point it just took the wrong turn and kept feeding us with boring plot. Then it was cut to action scenes which made us forget about plot and put us to edge how good they actually looked but moment they were gone comes realization that it didn't fix anything and again put us into horrible decision or sub-plots. Then action comes back and it's 'great' villain which seemed less scarier than Batman if you take him to perspective because of miserable power that it showed us. Steppenwolf just seemed like he is good at kicking things around and provide no real satisfaction from villain that it's supposed to be. In the end it seemed like it was no trouble to defeat him but company fighting him just made themselves more problems with their decisions. Directing as always from Zack Snyder is like 'seen that', 'been there' and 'done that', nothing new and interesting that will keep you amazed and even sometimes bad as you look into movie and see scene jumps from the start to the immediate end and you're like 'okay they just cut the whole middle of scene'. Stars in movie are pretty much all the same and gave performance as expected, except Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Flash (Ezra Miller) which both had their good and funny scenes and absolutely stole moments of their screening time. It wouldn't hurt to make movie more violent and with far more story telling but not much longer in time which doesn't seem like tough thing to do but we are only here to watch the movie and not make it. 2.5/4",6,0,1,21 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Perfection
","First movie of greatest trilogy ever created in movie history and it was a long but absolutely brilliant journey. Things are changing and darkness has been awoken so now Fellowship must survive all unexpected events and bring Ring to Mordor so it could be destroyed. Considering extended version of movie has a run time of 200min without credits it is a very long movie but while watching movie you don't feel that way. Brilliance of film maker Peter Jackson is amazing as he introduces us into a world of Middle-Earth without any trouble and simply doesn't miss a thing giving us complete movie with full picture of what will come later. Every one of the characters had it's purpose and served it well, so now nine companions are on journey through Middle-Earth being chased by Nazgul's and Orcs. Power of the Ring is also well portrayed with many many scenes from Gollum that is deformed and has disturbed mind so now Bilbo also shows in many times how his force is being drawn to dark. Boromir showed as weakest from the moment he saw Ring, he was being drawn to it but at the moment of his death he realized how messed up he was. Aragorn was magnificently characterized by Viggo and throughout movie it hits that he has great power and is destined to make great things. Also movie keeps sometimes light approach with couple totally funny moments and amazing cinematography. Vastness of lands is incredibly shown with large shoots taken and from all perspectives. Directing of Peter is miraculous and there was not even a slightly moment where you will feel like he failed, shifting between moods from calm to excited to calm again from scene to scene. 4/4",10,0,0,16 December 2016
The Village," Pretty twisty
","Group of people lives in isolated place surrounded by forest and as you learn couple of secrets and discover new things everything starts to unravel and secrets come out. Slowly you start to get feeling of place and how isolated it feels and creepy moments multiply the experience but then characters come to play and they are even more terrifying. Place looks like bunch of secrets, dark dark secrets lies in there and it is very intimidating. Ivy and Lucius slowly start to get hold of each other as movie progresses and it turns into a romance and Noah is a guy with some kind of mental disorder that has unspoken intentions. Lucius is one of the bravest in the village and his will to be different is amazingly shown throughout movie. Accident that has affected Lucius now forces some doubts and questions so Ivy is the one to act. Learning horrifying things, considering she is blind, she doesn't give up on anything and it gives a nice storyline after in the movie. There isn't much that can be said to unravel secrets that movie hides but definitely when they start to get out there are massive consequences. Ending was something that was pretty unexpected but in the other hand somehow good and gave some power to the story. Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius and Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy were amazing and gave a very good performances. 3/4",8,0,0,22 December 2016
The Revenant," It is an extremely beautiful and very intense movie
","Group of trappers travel through wilderness running away from Ariarka's, Hugh gets attacked by bear which led to many unexpected events and even some brutal scenes. Scenes at the beginning of the movie are absolutely incredible from great way of filming them to camera movement which went throughout whole movie. Bear scenes it very intense and greatly shot but somewhere at the beginning of the attack it felt like unreal which kinda lost later on and looking at beginning of attack where bear was made to look big so it power of him was multiplied later it seemed like they decided to get him to normal size, that could be only camera work to make him look bigger and later like normal bear. From that point where Glass was left to mercy of Fitzgerald and his betrayal which buildup from beginning meant only one thing, that it is going to be a wild hunt. All adaptations and surviving of Glass is incredible and his power to get to Fitzgerald is incredible. As movie goes we are coming closer to their final moments and when it happened it was incredible. So much rage, power, hatred and sadness were in that final scenes that it was horrifying to watch. Filming of Revenant and scenes were pretty beautiful and almost every scenes followed with some kind of nature and wilderness shot is great. Effect of loneliness and isolation is constantly on your mind from beginning to the end. DiCaprio and Hardy were both magnificent and their performances were astonishing. Leo as Hugh Glass is destroyed mentally but hatred, pain and sadness are filled in every scene where he's in. Tom as Fitzgerald was pretty terrifying giving a very dark and cold performance that was filled with cynicism and bad behavior. Directing of the movie was pretty sweet and Alejandro proved his worth. 4/4",10,1,3,5 January 2017
Split," Pure power
","Three girls are being kidnapped and held hostage in mysterious place which is held by Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder. It is one creepy, terrific, disturbing and dark ride from the beginning to the end of the movie. As we learn more and more about Kevin and some of his personalities it gets more and more complicated and it starts to get really dark. With constant mention of the Beast and some doubts about it which are beautifully given us by Kevin's psychiatrist Fletcher. Only Casey from those three girls has a real values to story and with flashbacks that were from beginning weird and seemed like something was off they towards end filled magnificently and gave a real power to story. From early age and abuse that Kevin experienced now he developed mechanisms to keep him from harm and some so evil and powerful that will blow our minds. Tension kept building up really fast and time has come to final act of the movie. It was insane how vision of Shyamalan went to screen. It was bloody, dark, terrific, horrible and very disturbing. All praise to James McAvoy for playing 9 characters out of 23 (24) and his brilliant performance as well as characters shifting scene which was mind blowing. Shyamalan creation has returned more powerful than ever and there is much to say to his creation of this beautiful story. 4/4SPOILER ALERT! Considering flashbacks it was quite fitting to have them in way that Night put them so he could not give us too many information but kept us wondering and trying to figure things out. Showing the Beast and it's power is pretty intense with some great capabilities for further development. As some other characters in Unbreakable universe this one feels really superior and dark. Cafe scene was such a great ending for the movie and it finally gave this movie a genre, place and power that it deserved.",10,5,16,1 February 2017
North by Northwest," Incredible piece
",Man gets mistaken for another guy finding himself in difficult situation but that didn't stop him in his pursuit for truth and love. Once more Alfred brings us a masterfully dramatic movie with so much great moments and many twists and turnouts of events that pushed limits of movie. Roger managed to survive attempts on his life and now goes through extremely hard times maintaining pace with guys that want to kill him. On his journey he encounters women that is mysterious but has some unspoken intentions and every scene with Eve and Roger was quite charming. Now they have fallen in love but she's a secret agent that is spying on Vandamm but Roger is persistent in getting to Eve. Thereafter Roger now went through all kind of events and faking but everything that he was doing payed of when he found himself in situation where he was saving Eve. Roger and Eve are now driving again in train and movie ends in place where they met each other. It was very powerful and tricky picture with some serious and incredible action scene but also deeply romantic and quite pretty. Cary Grant who played Roger was great with his charm and determination in finding truth but also very emotional performance. Eva Marie Saint was Eve and she was extremely loving character with so much emotions and passion. James Mason as Vandamm was very calm but gave dangerous and dark view on his character. 3.5/4,10,1,5,14 December 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Entertaining
","Wizard comes into muggle world and loses some of his magical and incredible animals which cause some problems. Start of the movie had a great deal of information on dark wizard Gellert that from the beginning you are in expectation of him and it kind of triggers later on. So now Newt is trying to figure out where are his beasts while being constantly followed by Tina and her paranoia about everything and Jacob, a muggle that wants to open a bakery but accidentally found about beasts. As movie goes it gets darker and a lot of characters get in the way and most interesting is Percival (Colin) that is a dark and powerful character which helped a lot to get a notion that he might be important. Last 20 minutes of the movie were absolutely amazing as Depp got his on screen time and it was great to see him. Movie is sometimes very slow paced and doesn't get an idea where it is going but then it somehow gets there. Eddie as Newt is absolutely incredible as he proves he is magnificent actor that deserves everything and in movie his love towards beasts and kindness are huge. Colin as Percival is also brilliant with not so much time on screen but when he gets there he just shines even brighter then everybody else. Most interesting movie character is Jacob played by Fogler, it is entertaining, funny and brings brightness to everything. Katherine's character Tina is very hard and sometimes it is incredible but sometimes feels like boring and you just wish she wants there at all. Beasts are magnifying. Entertaining movie with some great and extremely funny situations but sometimes pacing isn't correct and flow of the movie seems sometimes messed. 3/4",8,9,17,17 November 2016

","Miyazaki has proved to be the best creator of as much as visually stunning, intelligent and powerful movies. After Chihiro and her family enter the magical world it gets really serious. Movie just gets interesting with every minute that passes and constant discoveries of new world keeps us speechless. While Chihiro is new to all she adapts very fast and tries to solve mysteries that are going on. She does everything to help her family and it's just nice to watch. Intelligent writing of Hayao and plot development is beyond a lot of movies created by powerful companies. As Chihiro is involved in everything and she goes around trying to figure out how to help her parents, save them and herself and leave that world at the same time she tries to help a Haku and other characters that are trapped in magical land. Finally at the end when Haku realized that his name is Kohaku river and as Set (Chihiros name in magical world) is brought to tell which of the pigs are her parents she does it correctly and sets her parents free. As she has brought to river and crosses, runs to her parents with joy and happiness. Their ignorance about everything shows us that Chihiro is strong character as she realizes that she saved them but they do not know that and anyway she is happy. Strong movie with a lot of twists and turnovers but beautifully shown world and everything inside. 4/4",10,0,1,3 September 2016

","In world were things are trying to fall apart there is hope for some good things and they must fight for it with everything they have. Frodo and Sam encounter a Gollum and now are being leaded by him while Theoden, King of Rohan is set free by Gandalf the White and now leads his people away from trouble into Helm's Deep. Merry and Pippin in meantime are pursuing Treebeard to go into war with Saruman. As dark grows stronger so does power of Ring and Frodo feels consequences and loses sometimes himself in power. Another great introduction into couple of new important characters and some new great storytelling followed with many troubles that strike upon our main characters. Incredible buildup of story until the final moment of great fight for Helm's Deep that was absolutely miraculous and at it's finest. Power of dark was well shown and put hell of a fight for Men and others defending while Treebeard in his anger of lost friends unleashes power of Ent's upon Isengard. Again Gimli shines with his fun giving us a light in dark times and Aragorn once more proved to be a true leader of Men while being well respected by Legolas an incredible companion. Directing of Peter was at the same level as the first movie giving us one incredible ride with some pretty amazing scenes.

Schindler's List," Heartbreaking story
","Story of Oskar Schindler told by one of he greatest directors Spielberg is probably one of the most memorable things ever shown on screens. Schindler is war opportunist that saw a way to make a profit in employing Jews but later on chose the path of saving them from executions. Throughout movie you are constantly loaded with horror that was put upon Jewish people in the WWII. Oskar met with Stern, Jewish accountant, to help him deal with all paper work and over period of time got a real friendly and cared for him as friend. After almost two hours of pure torture, horror, sadness and pain there come a hope as Oskar wan't to save as much as possible Jews from being sent to Auschwitz and he even bribes others to help him execute plan. After train with men came it was surreal but seemed like it will happen and then it did train with women was sent by mistake to Auschwitz and it kept breaking heart from moment to moment with a great of pain and horror. After realizing that Oskar went everywhere and demanded them back and thankfully he managed to correct that. SS surrenders and factory scene is so heartfelt and satisfying. Oskar was forced to leave and in his way to car he just emotionally falls apart and starts to talk about saving even more Jews. Final scene are incredible and full of emotions, happiness and at the same time pain. All three of most memorable characters played by Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley are absolutely magnificent.

A Quiet Place," It will be one of the best in year
","While watching Quiet Place every little sound from cracking of popcorn to sound of someone drinking soda will drive you nuts because of perfect sound mixing and silence that tend to elevate every scene. It's post-apocalyptic world where Lee (John Krasinski) puts efforts to make his family safe from monsters that are walking on the Earth. After brief insight into life of Abbott family and events that reshaped their thoughts you are being pushed into territory where you are aware of your surroundings more than ever in theatre. Actions turn around quickly and you are eye to eye with monstrous predators that are destroying by detecting sound. Plot of movie is simple, you just need to follow it passionately and it will take you on great journey through pain, grief and fear which will capture your attention completely. Our two main stars John Krasinski who also directed this movie and Emily Blunt portray couple on screen with great deal of passion, especially seen in Emily's performance which was moving, profound and emotional on many occasions. Two little stars Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds showed us how great they are and that they will became very good actors. Millicent was mesmerizing and she brought many things to improve overall impression of how would you feel in world where you must not make sound but can hear one either. How movie moved towards ending you got feeling of protection and sacrifices that parents are doing to keep ones they love safe. There is definitely something to talk about when the movie is done with people that you saw it because it might just be one of the better Horror/Drama movie that came recently and it came from guy that never directed a horror movie. Krasinski delivers great performance on screen and seeing him as writer of such amazing story and at same time terrifying there might just be another actor that found himself in filmmaking and creating a great pictures. It's terrifying, deep, moving and beautiful movie, that you will absolutely love. 10/10",10,2,7,13 April 2018

Then just by the very end you can feel how scared Sal is and why he is doing everything that he had been told and that gets him killed. It was a heartbreaking as Sonny accepts his future and had acknowledged what happened. It all started as a simple bank robbery but then it turned into mental games that have been playing against Sonny and his goodness that keeps telling him to be good. Pacino provided one of the most heartbreaking, powerful, insane and mind bending performances that has been seen at the screen.

With it's intelligently writing that perform in every scene with a great and profound meaning that makes you wander and giving you a magnificent performances by our characters. As it's moving through a touchy parts of Mozart life and showing us his struggle and as well his big talent that is just unable to provide him everything that he should have, you can't but feel with the character of his. Amazing character that he was trapped in body of child and his dedication has driven him to the all sort of obsessions like the one over alcohol, after death of father it was obvious his character started to fell apart. Using everything against him and finally after his death Salieri was left without everything and you are able to see it in his behavior. Ending was one of the most memorable things, after you are shown father without any whatsoever life in him, pure madness of Salieri just takes control.

","After First Class and Days of Future Past there was a great X-men franchise happening and then Apocalypse came a just stormed everything that those two made and dropped everything. With it's lame and so boring plot, movie started to fall same as Apocalypse within one day it all felt apart. What could be the biggest ever hit, it hit us hard with boring scenes and poor dialogues as well as mutants that are not fun, not strong, not interesting just same as classic mutant. Then it got worse as Magneto gained unlimited power and started to be even more fearful then Apocalypse. Constant jumps and stupidity of Apocalypse is very unsatisfying and you are just in wonder what is going on with movie and why is there something like that in there. Not all mutants were bad there are some that will keep your heart pump big time and you will not be disappointed in whole movie. Forcing movie to be that developed and just played like that was a great fall because considering Apocalypse is the greatest it was pretty bad to end it so quick without any major resistance and some action that is going to leave you speechless in good way. 2.5/4",7,0,0,23 October 2016
1917," It's just GREAT
","In like 30 years into future people will probably talk about this movie that is how great it is. Following two young soldiers go into journey that will save many lives in 'one shot' is the peak of the movie making in 21st century.This masterpiece must be praised for a lot things.One shot filming is beyond this world and words can't describe how it makes you feel. Because scenes feel so long and takes take so much time tension and actions of our characters are elevated. Moving camera through so many things and obstacles that cinematographer Roger Deakins faced and his solution for every scene is brilliant and even if you try to pick point where he cuts, slides, fades camera is difficult. How time goes you realise that our characters are going to face more and more difficult things and the thing that just keeps you tight in seat.Each 'set' or scene has its own gems and gives different feelings. From scary to tense to death threatening to relaxed to heaven like to tragic feelings it just has no flaws and it is because of how much all actors rehearsed and knew exactly what to do and when gives you emotional rollercoaster.Directing of the movie of this proportions looks like just hardcore moviemaking and it feels like it would be so hard and you are right it had to be very difficult to move so many pieces to get perfect scenes that feel flawless and flowing like river.Let's not forget that you are getting teased by story and how it always manages to throw you off certain feelings and emotions to another ones that might even be opposite it like 2 minutes time. It's so simple premise yet done in such fashion that will keep you interested whole time. Movie is 2 hours long and it feels like you have witnessed whole day in 2 hours.Performances are great even though they are not center of point but two young actors George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are great at what they are doing. There are also scenes with Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott and Benedict Cumberbatch that are fantastic, just fantastic.Beautiful, powerful, moving, tense and will keep you hooked to your bones. 4/4",10,0,3,24 January 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Not quite as you would expect
","Movie starts with very high note, war is happening and everybody is so frightened so are out two little characters. It is a very nice story about brother and sister that have lost everything including their parents, considering war time it's hard for someone to judge the other but some of the actions are completely out of order, but they should have been better settled and taken care of because you should help other in trouble. Finally they move to aunt's and things just get worse, war is still on, she is just being too strong on them if you realize they lost everything and are trying to survive but such acts of hatred and judgment by your own kin is so frustrating and undeniably not appropriate. After all when they left it was also a bad thing to decide that they should live in some shelter and there is no doubt it also made a huge impact on their lives at the end. Great story telling and plot development with a very nice dialogue but some of the very actions done and partially decision are just bad and should not happen. 3/4",8,0,1,17 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," You will fight inner battle yourself while watching the movie
","Picking up from the last one we are immediately thrown into battle and fight between Resistance and First Order. It is spectacular, massive and powerful to watch each scene and how fighting between 'good and evil' goes but in the end if you appreciate previous movies you will feel betrayed and probably get stunned by details but not in a good way. Return of our beloved Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) gives us a new way of confrontation which passes and gets you hyped enough to bite bait and focus on movie. On the other side there are characters that will make you wonder like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) can get you real excited until further development or underdevelopment of characters goes through picture. Skywalker's contribution to story is pretty strong and mostly it feels constantly dragged toward his character. Discoveries throughout movie will keep it going and pull your focus to it with some stunningly scenes and landscapes because without any doubt it's one good looking movie. Now to get real with everybody there is so much need to tell you that movie gives some of the pretty laughable, ridiculous and stupid moments that if you really like movies you won't forgive. Rian Johnson, the director, man who also directed and wrote Looper which was fantastic, now gives every fanboy out there a material inside movie that will get them to the skies and beyond. Screenplay and directing done by Rian is fabulous without any doubt, it has some of the greatest fight scenes which look beautiful on big screen and you will definitely remember them. There is only one major criticism about characters is that Snoke got too little time and was so left behind and considering powerful man standing in his seat it could've been powerful performance. Overall experience of Star Wars: The Last Jedi without giving any spoilers that is very tough in such a movie is that it was well written and directed by Rian, followed by great performances but sometimes it felt that Johnson focused too much on fans of saga rather then to give us a more powerful story that he is capable of providing. 3/4 By the way Porgs are absolutely amazing.",8,1,5,5 January 2018
Logan," It's bloody great
","After they announced this is going to be last Wolverine instalment there was a lot of mixed emotions but after seeing this magnificently beautiful picture there is no doubt that it will be remembered as one of the best series sequels if not the best. Logan takes us to totally different and unexpected journey of survival and pain. Presenting Logan as old, disturbed and without any positive though whatsoever was really brilliantly melted into this incredibly written plot and story. This relentless and heart breaking drama that is mixed with maybe some of the most brutal and terrifying violence that is show throughout whole movie and never stops to surprise gave movie so much power. Seeing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) so old and weak but in the same time so powerful and without control over his mind was quite disturbing and frightening but in the same time love for Logan and Laura was greater than anything. Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) is the girl that is created so she could serve a weapon for fighting. She was so terrifying and violent that it was in some point weird to look at that but also her charisma and emotions and how she starts to understand more was interesting to watch. Logan (Hugh Jackman) gave us a surprise that maybe no one expected because his performance is probably the best superhero/drama performance ever seen. His disturbing character in year 2029 has seen too much and in every scene he proves that point and gives one of the best performances of his. Also a great and funny character was Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and he added something original to movie and gave a good performance in couple scenes that he featured. James Mangold is the man responsible for the Logan as he put a great effort in creating an amazing script and directing movie in incredible way. If time has come for superhero movie to push his way in some of major award this movie could do it because of its never stopping drama and some of the great efforts by cast. 4/4",10,0,3,4 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," Extraordinarily exceptional
","Movie is probably one of the biggest hits in the world with it's requirement for audience to feel like participants while they are constantly being presented with scenes that require some thinking and creating an opinion. It was incredibly shoot with some of the incredible beautiful scenes and scenes like when HAL is looking onto lips of our two guys giving you idea that it's highly advanced but incredibly dangerous and powerful. HAL is presented as highly advanced computer (intelligence) that has potential which when released is powerful and influential. Sequences in the beginning of the movie are incredible as you are forced to conclude everything and round up some sort of opinion and perspective that later on you will use to understand some of scenes. Everything in the movie is magnificent form soundtrack that brings tension and tries to prepare you for incoming events, to incredible dialogues and mind blowing scenes that are also beautifully created. As the ending of the movie is concerned, it was an extraordinary experience for almost 20 minutes. They have only one thing that are doing and that is making you think what is that you are seeing and is there anything that you might get from it. Possibly they are created to make you form an opinion on what movie is really about and all things that are unknown to us what will happen when you find out something horrific like that. 4/4",10,3,5,19 November 2016
Toy Story 2," Almost good as first one
","New adventures by Woody and his friends have come and they were almost as entertaining as the first one. Plot of the second movie is also very entertaining from Woody's kidnap to rescue mission led by Buzz and then confronting another Buzz that was more advanced. In the meantime Woody encountered a Jessie and Stinky Pete that are also cowboy toys. After Woody's arm was fixed he want's to return to Andy but then had a doubt that changed his mind and left him determined to leave with Jessie. Then Buzz and company arrived and persuaded Woody to return but Pete trapped them and they were leaving. In their search for them at airport Woody and Jessie end up on plane but were rescued by Buzz and happily returned to Andy. Movie is a very interesting, with many twists that are often dramatic and leave you in suspense. It has a great story behind it self and is very enjoyable. Sometimes in couple of scenes things are too dramatic and seem stupid, for instance when Woody's horse is running fast as airplane. 3.5/4",9,1,3,6 November 2016
La La Land," Pushing boundaries and giving a great experience

Snowden," Amazing life story
",It is a remarkable thing to work for someone and know so little of what is going on in front of you and Snowden was one of them but his difference between the rest of guys has pushed him over the limit of what is happening in the world. His extraordinary capabilities and knowledge that he has and his not corrupted soul has moved him to try and make world the better place than it really seems to present itself. Story has a great momentum as it moves us from future to past all the time and gets us to learn more and more. Some things are not well covered in the plot and it created a bit moment of wonder and some holes but it does only that because real focus in the movie is Ed. Joseph was a pretty good choice for the role as he manages to bring character on top in his great and bad moments. Ending was told in very little time as you feel jumps from the scene to scene and revelation of his current status. It was amazing to see his face at the end and just listen to him. 3/4,8,5,11,2 October 2016
Don't Breathe," Incredible movie
","Movie shows us this guys that are robbing people and decide to rob a man that supposedly owns a great deal of money but as they are doing it things don't go as planned and you get the best horror movie of the year so far, maybe even of the decade. It starts slowly building tension with every minute and throws a couple of mysteries on your way to keep you aware that you don't know everything that is going on. Then in just one moment you get thrown on your seat in horror not knowingly what is going to happen and with blind man just showing his rage on one of our burglars. Eventually killing him left pure horror and fear for the other two, girl that is seems terrified to death and guy that is coming back to house without even realizing what will happen to him. Movie just keeps going and as they are trying to escape with stolen money in basement things show off and you are left in disbelief with what you see. After moment you are left to watch how blind man is haunting those two guys all over basement without any lights. You feel like there could be end to the movie and as blind man haunted them you get to final scene in the house where you feel like every hope for girl is lost comes the guy that should be dead and saves her. Throughout movie there's this sense of unknown and tension buildup that tends to grown into some chase scene and just keeping you in terror. Directing of the movie is absolutely incredible with some of the amazing shoots taken inside the movie with one shot scenes. Lang is absolutely terrifying and you can feel his grief, pain and sadness but at the same time he goes into crazy killing mode. Magnificent, terrifying, tense, incredible. 3.5/4",9,0,3,9 November 2016
Pulp Fiction," Brilliant movie
","Quentin showed the world his power and capability with Reservoir Dogs and lifted it up with Pulp Fiction. Brilliant and clever writing makes his movies one of the best in the world. Characters are deeply developed and dialogues that they spoke are just prefect. There is not a one part of movie that shouldn't be there, from simple car scenes and talk to some even more where he cites Bible or so better to say changes some part but keeps us in believe that it's real. Stories combining is just immaculately as he keeps plot flowing and adding every detail that we need. All people from Travolta to L Jackson to Willis are superb in their acting skills. Two most memorable scenes created by this movie are popular even today and will keep to be even in distant future no doubt. All talk and motion that movie created is so powerful that not even QT imagined that would happen. Briefcase and theories about it have changed everything about film making. So much movies are made but non of them keep the intensity as good as Tarantino movies, they move people to talk and discuss even things that are visually created on screen and shown to audience. Not a lot directors can say that about themselves. Every role in movie counts and has some kind of meaning and is put there because of something. Absolutely brilliant, intelligent and masterfully created movie. 4/4",10,0,2,2 September 2016
Joker," Finally a movie we deserve!
","Joker will draw you into his madness and sociopathy that will make you question everything. Todd and Joaquin bring us a masterpiece of human nature and how person is shaped by events that are happening to them.Joker is a dramatic piece that will be understood by regular people and seen in grey areas and not only black and white. It's about human tortures and dramatic events that happen all around us but we pretend like everything is fine. Joker dives deep into dark teritories and pushes boundaries with extreme violence but shows us why is everything happening and how our protagonist is dealing with information given to him. Arthur Fleck is a disturbed man which is evident from beginning but as story goes you find to learn more about him and how he is only trying to find its way in the crazy world.There are multiple possibilites for someone if they pursue them, they might not be the best but Arthur chooses one that he feels most comfortable with and his sense of comedy and darkness is unique but who are we to put his hopes and dreams down. Joaquin's commitmend to role is extraordinary, he pushes boundaries with his dedication for characters place and feelings. It is absolutely magnificent to watch him present us Arthur in all his colors and shades as he is mesmerasing, deceving and twisted.Todd moving from his regular comedy type movies and going full drama, choosing Joker (DC comics based character) and putting him in real world with real people insted of fictional universe is praise worth and him developing such a intriguing story that will feel like you are watching some regular drama inspired by time and day we live in. We live in sick and hard times but we choose to fight and overcome everything but there will always be other ones that are not capable of doing it and it will make them mad. Insted seeing this movie as movie that can make people do bad things it should make them see that bad things are not acceptable and how they make things dark and chaotic. and will always end in personal destruction.Directing and writing of Joker is marvellous from every point, it may not be the smart as some movies but it is captivating and makes you wonder all the time how things are going to happen and how they might have happened. Todd may have started his new path into greater film making and it will be interesting to see what he has to offer in the upcoming years.Dark, twisted and magnificent are the best words to describe the movie. 10/10",10,1,1,9 October 2019
Inception," Mind bending movie
",After some marvelous movies that Chris Nolan made finally came the best movie ever in genre Sci-Fi that will probably ever be made. With powerful cast and knowledge that we had about his writing and directing skills there was no doubt this movie will be great only thing we did not know it was pretty amplifying experience seeing those characters dig deep into the dreaming world and trying to provide their best effort to make it all run smoothly. From the start it was obvious movie requires total concentration and following of everything then immediately it got very serious with discovering all kind of characters and their place in this work of master. With incredible balance between action and intelligent plot movement you are going deeper and deeper into the world where anything can happen. It's beautifully and intelligently written with profound sense for the characters that are amazingly well played and portrayed great companionship of characters and their adapting in situations they found them selves. Ending was ... mind bending. 4/4,10,0,2,12 October 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Interested in this one? Well...
","Incredible Hercule Poirot returns and it's Murder on the Orient Express that will have to take his presence once again. Going into this movie knowing how Poirot established himself as great detective you will probably find it very delightful and sweetened but as soon as serious action and plot kicks in you will realize that it's not what you thought it will be. You have seen how serious cast of the movie is and without blink of an eye you will want to see this, it's not to blame you but after coming to screening of it the excitement will come down as movie starts to come to it's end. Samuel Ratchett is murdered and Poirot tired and on vacation gets into his role and solves the crime one more time. It started pretty amazing and with potential but as story went it just kept losing it's so much needed tension and it will just lack that mystery that keeps movie like this going. Pieces of puzzle start to get into it's places as you find out more and you realize movie is trying to play tricks with you but if you have been careful you will not get distracted and will find movie pretty astonishing from directing point of view and there are some pretty beautiful scenes in movie. Plot is also great but somehow it just can't live up to it's true potential which will get you stuck to you seat and in wonder what will strike next. Directing of Kenneth Branagh was pretty amazing and also his contribution as main character Hercule Poirot as which he gave a truly good performance proving his talent over and over. Rest of cast featuring Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Tom Bateman gave probably as much as any of them had some of them even stole scenes more than others but they didn't have that power of intimidation that could help us being dragged into picture and scenes. Movie was stunning to watch, cast was very good at their job but they just could get their hands on attracting audience enough to care for all mystery. One more thing portraying journey and placing actions of movie between Vinkovci and Brod was pretty amazing seeing all scenes but showing it as mountains that even Alps could envy considering that part of Croatia is the flattest and mountain free was just absurd but all in all it was amazing scene. 2.5/4",6,0,1,21 November 2017
Finding Dory," Another adventure but not like first one
","Once more fish get lost and we are following whole adventure and travel of Dory. It was visually impressive and very nicely executed only things not quite explained was how in first place did little Dory end on other side of ocean. It was quite journey with beautiful scenery and very intimidating dialogue. After encountering an octopus story got much better because of humour that kicked immediately and how lighter everything was. Octopus was the best part of the movie with it's many many funny moments and situations that it was creating. How storytellers managed to fill story was very nicely done and how they fit everything inside this story on emotional base was also quite nice. Considering that we already experienced story that goes similar it was not quite a surprise to see how things end but it was entertaining and there were not moments that are boring. Throughout movie there is a flow of how things go and guys from Pixar definitely know how to do it, but it is not their best one. They need to bring something new and more entertaining to everybody. 3.5/4",9,2,8,23 November 2016
Arrival," This could possibly be the best SF ever
","Extraterrestrial life arrives in 12 random locations on Earth and humans face their biggest challenge of all, communication between us and them. First of all movie was absolutely spectacular in every way and so much knowledge and intelligence combined to create an extremely clever and smart movie in years. Continuity in developing plot and learning things from directing that was amazing is incredible as you are not being forced to break your mind in information but gives you time to process everything. Scenes were extremely beautiful specially once inside shell ( extraterrestrial ship) were mind blowing with lots of buildup and intensity. Way of putting scenes and editing of every frame of movie was incredible, just giving you what you need and no more. Then ending comes and as it starts to reveal everything giving audience all answers and revealing everything was amazing and beautiful at the same time. Amy Adams was magnificent as she proves her great talent and elevates every single scene with her commitment and passion but also love and understanding. Jeremy Renner was also such a great character inside movie and giving us a more scientific approach but also shows his skill and passion. Writing and directing can be only described with miraculous. Intelligent, passionate, brilliant, moving, strong. Spectacular. 4/4",10,11,25,29 November 2016
Paths of Glory," Great war story
","Kubrick is definitely one of the greatest movie directors and it also shows us here what he's capable of. As one of the characters is driven by the mad will for promotion he commands an attack that has completely killed the whole squad and then he tries to turn things around and blame it on three guys. It was just outrageous how they got sentenced to death and it all goes down as officers try to do everything what they can to get Staff in sparing those man, but he is just trying to get everyone to believe him. Those man are executed, next morning it all goes down as Mireau finds out about how he was set up and thing starts unravel what every office desired to accomplish. It was shown how everybody wants something in war but also some want what is best for their man and some will do anything when they are offered right thing. Ending scene is absolutely magnificent and you can't help but to start getting overwhelmed and getting sense that everything is going to be all right. 3.5/4",10,1,3,1 October 2016
Back to the Future Part II," Lacks momentum
","From the start it created sense that it's going to be complicated and it continued to be throughout whole movie, as they were desperate to explain everything that is happening and move almost whole focus on that you are being left with too little space for plot. Plot is a bit twisty and keeps you thinking about it whole time as it changes from future to present to past and great help was that comedic creation of scenes and characters that are funny. Whole new adventures for Marty and Doc are made and sometimes it was very enjoyable to watch. Again Marty is very well played character that keeps the movie going and with great help of Emmett they made a movie that is not as good as the first one but you can enjoy the movie knowing that altering something is going to create a new path in past and you are always moved to see what they did. 3/4",8,1,2,8 October 2016
Marriage Story," So PERFECT it is scary
","Noah Baumbach with another incredible story that is made like it's taken from real life and shown us on screens all around. A couple going through rough divorce and their compelling will and fight for everything, it could be said even for their lives as it turns into hell.It seems like Noah keeps bringing us more and more and more, as it keeps getting powerful and powerful. If you imagine perfect marriage that does not exist this is the best next thing to that and we are able to see it from both eyes of him and her. It's crazy how much hurt can bring you things that you love and how much love can bring you things that hurt. Seems like paradox but eventually it is what it is and Marriage Story is all of that and much more.Measures and distances that humans are willing to go and fight for just increase with love and that is what this movie is trying to portray and it absolutely did. Directing by Noah is also pretty interesting to watch as he takes some different approaches to give us sense of distance and loneliness, on the other side closeness and love. It absolutely is drama filled with emotions but after you end the movie there is a big appreciation for those humorous scenes that made you laugh even though consciousness is hitting you like, It's bad, This is sad, Don't forget what you are watching and then you are back to sadness that this story is giving you all along.Let's just say that Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are so beautifully great and keep pulling you to each side with their emotional roller coaster that Noah has put them on and they deserve all praises for their performance. Each of them brings their talents that are amazing that they can play whatever they want. Hands up one of the best duos (male-female) that is charismatic, profound andd emotional to the skies.Brilliant, Emotional, Powerful. 4/4",10,5,7,31 January 2020
Mother!," It's masterpiece once you connect all pieces
","First rule of going to see Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, Black Swan) movie is to be open minded and not to freak out when he starts to throw out stuff that in first might not make sense but you need to let the feeling take over you. Loving couple gets their paradise interrupted upon arrival of strange visitor and it just picks up from there to things that you can't imagine that Aronofsky saw. In moment that movie ends and you are leaving theater there are voices of people talking - What did I just see -, -What just happened-, -This is one of the worst movies I saw-, -I don't get it- and just then you find couple people fighting with themselves trying to figure out bigger picture of it and frankly told you need to spend some time putting peaces together because it ain't easy at first. In moment you realize how magnificent and full of lively metaphors movie is you are mind blown with how little director/writer of movie can do. Darren Aronofsky made a huge venture in trying to transform bigger picture to movie screen which seems impossible until you see and realize it. His great and masterful directing skills are all over the movie and there is only place to enjoy it at it's best without losing a sight of his vision. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem gave a pretty tight and so nice to watch performances filled with constant emotions of all kind. Appearance of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer was also quite noticeable because of their class and acting skills that will never disappoint you. Only thing that might get you angry is complexity that movie presents and puts on you to figure out but you can't be thrown off because of that. One of the biggest visionary picture that came in years and that probably will change how you look at movies deserves a praise for being bold and trying to present itself in the best and beautiful way possible. Beautiful, bold, mind bending, emotional. 3.5/4",9,2,5,7 November 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Wasted potential
","First of all, do we really need one more story telling of how it all began?? NO! It has already been done why are you doing it again. Second, whats with the title Batman v Superman you all think people wouldn't that there is almost non of Batman Superman fight. You could just name it Dawn of Justice and we all would be very happy. More than first hour was boring and wasted on some crappy things that it was too much but it wasn't all bad. Then it passed and something actually started to happen. Until the very end you can feel how it is just growing in tension and getting better and then BOOM Martha. Save Martha part is very much discussed and some say that Batman just wanted to save his mother no matter the name BUT you simply could then rewrite Martha with mother and everybody would be happy but no you need to say Martha. Fight scenes are very nice probably one of the best but there aren't many of them. Affleck as Batman was great, he acted superb. Lois too much of damn Lois in the movie, what happened there? She is not needed so much, she mustn't be main focus at every scene she plays. Personal : Lex Luthor I connected with character too much so I can't say too much but I loved him. I liked how he controlled, spreads his madness and it's enjoyable to see him. Realistic: Lex is too much Eisenberg. After all if they learn on mistakes they have done here, Justice League, Wonder Woman and all other movies could be something to look forward. 2/4",5,0,0,2 September 2016
Toy Story 3," Brilliant third movie
",From the start it was obvious some changes are gonna be made but that they are going through this drastic moments was not even a thought. It was unbelievable adventure and just pure enjoyment to watch Woody and rest of toys get set up many obstacles in their plan to return to Andy. Plot was absolutely perfectly written and amazingly intelligent with some great twists and unexpected moments. So many amazing scenes with a perfect balance between expected and unexpected and great ways to turn toys into a clever things that never run out of ideas. Once more Woody goes through a tough period and a lot of doubts but finally decides to stay with his friends and Andy allowed him in the brilliant ending where he plays with for the last time and leaves them in a very good hands of Bonnie. Woody watches Andy leaving on porch was a great ending of a magnificent third part. Toy story 3 surpasses even Toy story in some ways as being more interesting. 4/4,10,0,2,7 November 2016
Rear Window," Absolutely brilliant
","Without any doubt Hitchcock is one great director and he made so many great film that you can't help but just talk great about his work. This piece of art is also magnificently told and just keeps you going and meanwhile changing your opinion many times during movie. Did he kill or did he not how to be certain and then things just get real bad. Then the character of neighbor is more revealed and you get feeling that he might have killed his wife. After all trouble and nervousness that couple of scenes brought it's finally clear that he killed her without any doubt but... Here he comes and there is no one to protect Jeff as he is unable to get away but threat is closer and closer. Finally it get to he high point in movie where he struggles to keep his life and amazingly he does it. So much tension this movie brings that it you keeps you stunned and focused for almost two hours and you want more but it ends. Performances by our lead actors were amazingly beautiful and they are something you are going to remember and tell everyone about. Magnificent, glorious, tense, profoundly mysterious. 4/4",10,0,2,27 October 2016

Heat," Story that is truly great
","At the beginning you are introduced to a bunch of characters that have their minds set on common things and some that are trying to stop those from robbing. Movie bases it's plot development on simple fact that they only know one so called nickname at it was absolutely great to see how story goes from there and how it ends. Along the way as characters are getting deeper in their thoughts and actions movie just starts to kick off high as it becomes tense, creating great suspense at times, then just showing you how brutal and violent it can be and finally how it kept destroying character that you didn't even thing it would get and some of the guys that deserved it. Al Pacino is incredible in his role, as he goes through various stages and moods that are followed by great emotions and some amazing scenes. Robert is also great as he shows his love towards women he feel for, hatred towards guys that betrayed him and that wanted to cross him over and is filled with emotions. Others were also incredible but not as those two guys and they sometimes leftover to get their chance to show but never get it fully. Amazing directing of movie with great action scenes that result in great violence and some dialogues were profound and emotional and just amazing. 3.5/4",9,3,5,11 November 2016
Deadpool," Captain Deadpool rules
","This movie proved that you don't need hundreds of millions of dollars to make a enjoyable and great movie. After it final hit the cinemas excitement about this was huge. Deadpool is the funniest and most entertaining strip character. Movie had some holes in it but it was nothing to care about. Everything how we get to know him before and after was well edited and put together. Jokes aren't the smartest but they are just the one when you hear them you feel entertained. Deadpool as character is funny as hell but at the same time so loving and sarcastic but most of all violent. Movie just portrayed his power and capabilities. Reynolds was perfect choice for the role as he is very funny and tends to joke all the time but in the same time looks strong. Then his girl get kidnapped and he must get to her and save her while taking everybody that made him like that and showing who is the boss. It classic story of battle between two guys only that they are both in kind of way bad. Two characters that helped him get to her are well played. Granny and Deadpool are perfect, you just love them. Movie was funny, violent, entertaining, well acted and GCI is amazing just amazing. Despite all that waiting and finally making the movie that had medium budget it was a great hit. 4/4",10,1,6,2 September 2016

Trying to figure out how cubes work and how to move around made them work together. Movie basically is about human trust and how behave in unexpected and most cruel situation giving us a view that we are not well behaved even stupid kind that first acts and then waits to see the results of action. Now acting in the movie isn't something that will get you, it was good nothing special they acted probably like normal person would do it. Characters are something else they are obviously created to be totally different and from couple of minutes there is a sight of what they really are. There were some scenes that are amazing, very intense and intimidating. Originality of movie is also something that need to commended. 3/4",7,0,2,17 December 2016

","Once more Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves united and gave us action masterpiece. As we start to go deeper to universe that John Wick is centered and learn more about society that is present in that world movie takes step to higher grounds. After John is being forced to do things that he firstly refuges to do, fighting for his life he turns page and once more being pis*ed more than first time he goes in hunt for everybody that wants him dead and does that in magnificent way. Eventually got himself in even more trouble than before now he starts to show his power and his vulnerability. Greatly choreographed action sequences are even more intimidating than previous and constantly advance to surprise with cleverness but considering that director Chad was stunts coordinator previously he shows real skill in doing such scenes. It was lightness in some scenes that kept movie going with some fun and easier story development but in the end everything goes to Keanu Reeves in his new perfect role and dedication in improving his skills to serious levels. Adding Laurence Fishburne to this world will in future mean a serious business and most definitely he will be able to improve this world even more. John Wick Chapter 2 offers something that not even Raid 2 could offer to Raid: Redemption and that is more story telling and more background to universe without losing a bit of powerful action scenes. 3.5/4",9,2,5,24 February 2017
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Insane
",Movie is something you have definitely never seen and totally didn't expect to see. It's extremely funny throughout whole movie with so silly and insanely ridiculous situations and dialogues that just penetrate in you with so much force and you are unable to fight it. Absolutely mid blowing experience of stupidity and unconventional way of making movie makes you forget it's every flaw and just sucks you in the unique experience of the movie. If you take half of the comedies and combine them together you are still not even close to silliness of the movie and it's originality. It's very jumpy and twisty but it just uses that to prove you that it can do that and still keep you fully aware of everything. Movie is totally made for everybody who appreciates craziness and silliness on highest level. 3.5/4,9,1,2,25 November 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Great story of man
","Movie starts with very intense scene of torture and then it turns into a powerful story telling life of a men that is on his way to win a Who wants to be a millionaire. Throughout movie you are being feed with a great deal of life altering moments, sometimes pure survival moments that have led to final moment and pure happiness after all tragedy, pain and suffering that Jamal experienced. At moments it was extremely painful to watch the movie because of cruelty and pain that was obviously present on our lead man but sometimes it felt like is just taking too long to get to real story telling. Script was amazing with such great and heartfelt moments alongside with beautiful and magnificent directing of Danny it was a recipe to success. Movie is also light as some points where there are songs being singed and it just elevates movie. Even we suffer a lot from our whole life movie tries to show us that even then we can be happy and succeed in our life. 3.5/4",9,0,4,14 November 2016
The Nice Guys," Special style for great movie
","Talking about Shane Black is interesting because man has special view on everything and you can see that throughout his all movies. Nice guys manage to be crime story with so much comedy and that makes this movie even better. Gosling and Crowe are perfect match and they just help each other to be even funnier. As movie goes it tries to keep you confused as what is really going on who is good and who is bad. Holland's daughter is very nicely played and has a great deal of importance in the movie as she tends to bring all best in both characters. Freedom that are actors given to make scenes in unique way is fantastic as both of them are one of the best in that job. Some things are smart enough but with overall feeling about movie you just don't care so much. Such ignorance about some things in movie and plot makes it funny and enjoyable to watch. Unique, twisty, violent and most of all funny. One of the better crime comedies recently thanks to the Ryan and Russell as much as great writing and directing. 4/4",10,9,17,3 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," We can argue all we want but it's absolutely mad
","Since very first minute up to very last minute it just keep going, moving, racing, running and chasing. Action/chase scenes are gorgeous and created by real master of it's occupations George Miller. After all these year when you think what is going to be next perfect and moving movie you would not expect action, science-fiction movie to deliver it. From cinematography to every little detail all people that worked on movie thought about everything. Furiosa is such a strong character that fights and stands for something that it's just beautiful to watch her in every scene. Max played by Hardy huh? Hardy proved to be one of best upcoming actors that can play anything, just remember Locke, but at the same time no Gibson and you won't be disappointed because Hardy made even better job. Personal opinion: I like action and sci-fi very much but when I look at Mad Max I find it more powerful than any movie given 100 on Metacritic or any movie given 9.3, 9.2 and 9.0 on IMDb. 4/4",10,0,6,31 August 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel comes stronger then ever
","Desmond Doss decides to apply for military service and being medic but his believes are going to lead him in many, many strange ways. Movie is divided in two part first is a love story and second is war story with some features of kindness and caring. As we learn more and more about Desmond we are learning about his father and every scene that Tom Doss was in was stolen by him as he portrays a veteran that has seen unimaginable things which left mark on him. His perception and understanding was incredible but at the same time emotional and powerful. Then we lean more into Desmond and Dorothy and their love and caring for each other. As everyone in camp starts to realize what their life is with Desmond and his believes they are all unable to stop themselves form hurting him but his love and believes are so great that he forgives all. Just as everything couldn't get worse Tom Doss finally show how he cares and loves his son but also by his decision Desmond saved 75 men. Then war scenes came into first plan and they were absolutely staggering showing us what true horror and pain looks like. First sequence was about 15 minutes long and it was one of the most brutal war scenes every shown, with so many details and absolutely incredible directing throughout them. Next came the commitment combined with pain and struggle in his amazing saving of every wounded men despite threat that was always upon Desmond's neck and how he continued with pure will to push himself to limit. After that he was everybody's hero that they all need to keep pushing and just to give their best. Garfield played Desmond and he played it like it was his last, so much power and emotions made role of his career in this picture. Weaving as Tom Doss is one of the biggest surprises, giving an extraordinary performance as he is believable and shows us every little thing about his struggle. Mel's directing was as always on top and gave us once of the best pictures in 2016 with some incredibly violent and terrifying scenes, meaning many great things should come up by him in future. 4/4",10,4,8,29 November 2016
Me Before You," There is something terribly wrong with Traynor
","Such a strong cast Clarke, Claflin and Dance and they did an amazing job. Throughout whole movie you have cheerful and funny scenes. As Louisa and Will get to know each other they start to feel very comfortable and tend to have a great time together, opposite at the beginning when Will treated her like sh*t. Then Louisa find out truth that he is only going to live certain period of time and then decided to take his life out. She keeps trying and loves him even more despite all that but his foolishness and selfishness is beyond every limit. We are humans and we tend to life no matter how hard it will be there so no human with right mind to kill himself because he can't do something and doesn't feel valuable anymore. And that is just unacceptable and probably all people need to agree with this and see that there is a problem with taking your own life. Only thing that will happen you will bring pain to other people. Twisted and disturbed thinking of individual like Will should not be accepted as right. Despite all that ending was somehow peaceful with mixed feeling that were tending to happiness. 2.5/4",6,0,2,2 September 2016
Back to the Future," Exciting in every view
","Movie pushed the limits of everything and just created an extremely good feeling and enjoyable to watch as Marty experiences a lot of trouble while being send to the past. Messing with things that happened he altered the future and was forced to keep doing everything so he could still be alive. Emmett is very funny with his unusual behavior and overall joy, also his excitement about everything and his troubles that he constantly experienced made him an very memorizing character. While messing with past after going back to the present and hoping to prevent killing of Dr., Marty found that some of scenes changed and Emmett was alive after shooting. Ending was probably most exciting thing in the whole movie as Marty found out that everything is changed and also when Emmett arrived back he took him back to future to prevent something that happened to their children. Music was fantastic with some of very popular songs. Movie is funny at many way but also creates this extraordinary situations that constantly need to be fixed. 4/4",10,2,2,7 October 2016
Sully," Fascinating story
","Miracle on Hudson told from many different perspectives and how it affected pilots lives. Movie gradually builds up story even there isn't much to tell but it gives more focus on Sully and how he dealt with situation that was not going as everyone would expect. It was truly brave and exceptional thing to do knowingly and for that Sully deserved movie that will also try to give us picture of him and Hanks did a wonderful job. Hanks and Eastwood are trying to create feeling of how Sully felt and what he was going through all that time and it was spectacular. Hanks gives a strong performance as he is emotional, mentally distracted and goes through tough times but with support that he receives mostly from Jeff and then his family and friends. Aaron Eckhart played Jeff and he was also amazing with his whole trust and believe but also gratitude for saving everybody but also him. Clint Eastwood once more proves that there are stories to be told and that it's never to late for them to reach their top. Only thing that is a problematic considering it short movie some scenes were shown more times then one and it was done in spirit of film making but other than that it was amazing. 3.5/4",9,0,0,5 December 2016
