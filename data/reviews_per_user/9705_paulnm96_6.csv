The reason Big Daddy wanys to kill D'Amico is that he is the reason Big Daddy's wife died. So can the superheroes stop D'Amico or will Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who is D'Amico's son kill the heroes.The movie is extremely gory with gruesome scenes and a huge amounts of funny moments.,8,2,8,28 May 2011

Paranormal Activity," The Terror of Demons
","There's a scary feeling with a psycho killer on the loose but what if there is no killer just an evil spirit or demon it's truly terrifying.Katie has been terrorized by demons ever since she was a child and now having moved in with boyfriend Micah things have begun getting creepy once more therefore they bought a camera and set it up in their room. However the opening scene is boring and gives the sense of a true story. But strange things occur and loud bangs and noises are heard during the night.Micah appears eager to stop this by connecting with the demon. Katie however wants to contact a doctor, psychologist or an exorcist for help. Katie gets possessed by the demon and cannot control her actions or thoughts during the movie.DONNOT WATCH IT ALONE AT NIGHT!!!!! Watch it with subtitles to hear all the noises. The ending shown is better than the alternate ending (shown in Special Features) as it is creepier and leaves the viewer in fear especially as the viewer gets the impression it's based on a true story.",8,1,2,27 May 2011
Scream 2," The Revenge of Ghost-face
","'What's your favorite scary movie?' those words mean only one thing 'Scream'. That's right he's back ghost-face.Two years have passed but the nightmare isn't over. The opening scene is gruesome again but this time the viewer is brought to the cinema where 'Stab' is being shown which tells the story of 'Scream'. All the people in the cinema are wearing ghost-face costumes perfect cover for ghost-face eh? With the deaths in the cinema Dewey (David Arquette) and Gail Summers (Courtney Cox) return to solve the mystery once more.Sidney Prescott (Neve Cambell) the main star of the last movie is again targeted by the killer as more people she knows die can she survive again? But the question rises who is the killer is it a repeat of the original 'Scream' the boyfriend Derek (Jerry O Connell), is it random killers or is it a friend who is jealous and wants fame themselves.Craven reawakens the terror in us with a surprising ending but the comedy and light-hearted performance by the actors makes the movie again terrifying but also there are breaks of hilarity.",7,0,1,27 May 2011
Scream," 'What's your favorite scary movie?'
","'Scream' is a scary movie however the light-heart attitude of this movie makes it quite funny also.The story begins with a phone call and ends with a blood bath in true horror style. A young teenager Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) gets a mysterious phone call and the caller asks a series of questions most famously 'What's your favorite scary movie?' he terrorizes her for a good ten minutes and probably the most terrifying scene in this movie he finally kills her while wearing the famous ghost-face costume.The story jumps between horror and comedy, for most of the movie the viewer's heart is racing and for the rest they are roaring laughing. Much of the comedy is provided by the stupidity of Dewey Riley (David Arquette) the always lovable character.Much of this movie revolves around one character Sidney Prescott (Neve Cambell) and the grief she suffered since her mother was murdered and she a witness. An inpatient boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) seems a suspect of the Woodsboro murders as does many others even Sidney's father (Laurence Hecht) and her friends as well.I think it is safe to say Wes Craven has done it again in creating 'Scream' it is well recommended on seeing especially at night. So all I've left to say is 'What's your favorite scary movie?'",9,9,10,27 May 2011
