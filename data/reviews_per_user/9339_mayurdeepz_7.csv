Black Swan," A timeless & poignant thriller that is almost nonchalant in manner !!!
","After an incredibly inexplicable wait, 'Black Swan' finally saw the light of the day here in Malaysian theaters and I could not have missed it for the world. As a religion, I queued up infront of the Box Office, where I represented the first patron of the day and the theater barely 1/3rd filled, made it to the first show on a Saturday morning. With the large portion of the next 2 hours spent at the awe of what I experienced, I could finally sum up the pieces of my blown out mind as I sit to write this piece.3 specific names associated with the premise meant; it tagged along itself the rather heavyweight of all downers some like to call 'expectations'. French film giant Vincent Cassel, Natalie Portman and Darren Aaronofsky who most recently was celebrated for his violent yet heart breaking projection and Mickey Rourke's comeback vehicle 'The Wrestler'. Add to that 5 Oscar noms, 3 of which are for Best Leading Actress (Portman), Best Picture and Best Director and You have Yourself a list of sorts, that pretty much dictates to You why You should spend a well earned weekend morning inside the theaters.Black Swan is a fairly straight forward story of a ballet dancer and her evolution into a foray She was particularly destined to fail at. Thus it brings along her struggle, fights within her boundaries, reasons and contradicting perspective of pretty much everything She was always led to believe. Throw in some exceptionally well written characters, in the form of her Mom (Baraba Hershey), Mentor (Cassel), Peer (Mila Kunis) and Predecessor (Winona Ryder) around the protagonist that helps her development and along with the eventual narration of the story. All support staff of the production and the one at the helm of all affairs should be given special mention for building a rare mood that aggravated the tension and only added to the crescendo of climax built with a rare but dedicated eye for soul. That for me managed to do what no feature film has been able to do in the past few months. I shed a tear at the climax for it was that epic height that one achieves, specially in creative spheres after weeks, months and years of inspired but relentless and mostly fruitless perseverance.Quite fittingly the movie ends on a deafening sound of a hair raising round of applause by an auditorium filled with patrons who witnessed one of the finest renditions of the 'done to death' opera 'Swan Lake' because only they knew what they had experienced was both rare and timeless. Sadly the same cannot be said of the theater I watched the movie in, but as lights came on and credits rolled, I rose on my trembled feet and my heart swelled with the sense of fulfillment only a 35mm story can bring to me. And that's just how I would love to spend all my Saturday mornings for the rest of my life !!!Highly Recommended",9,1,3,20 February 2011
Collateral," Mind boggling Direction N Acting
","The moment I entered the theatre to see one of the most anticipated movie of the year(as far as I m concerned), I knew that I was in for a treat. Loved every moment of those slick camera styles, dialogue and of course the acting. Tom Cruise I always believed had what it required to make it big in Hollywood but for the past year and a half I believe he gave in the best performances in 'The last samurai' and this movie. I learnt that Russell Crowe was the original Vincent. With due respect to that great actor that he is, I still have firm belief that Tom Cruise was the perfect casting. The other lead Jamie Foxx is also fantastic, who I think is one of the most under rated black actors in Hollywood. He gave in a 'sucker punch' performance with this movie and I hope to see him in many different roles in the future. For me the ending was perfect and I believe every one in the theatre felt for Vincent. Jada looked good too. The best part about the movie was Michael Mann and it deserves 8/10.",Null,0,0,9 October 2004
I Am Legend," A fine end to an action packed year !!!
","Every now and then there comes a movie that compels your attention from start to finish. One that is sometimes so intense that although you grab your popcorn, it gets cold before it reaches your mouth. I guess you have pretty much understood what I mean. Special mention to what they have made New York look like is a pretty amazing feat. An aftermath of a huge tragedy. One of the many mess that we have witnessed the city get into over the years of cinema in Hollywood. Aliens, Godzillas, tornadoes, storm, terrorist attacks and now a ghastly epidemic. Having said all that, some parts of the movie reminded me of a recently released flick '30 days of night'. That feeling of deja vu actually took away some of the build up that it initially had. Besides that I do not see why it would fail to cash in this festive season in the box office. Will Smith is in full form and plays the lone ranger pretty much the way his director must have wanted him to. It would go down as one of his better performances along with 'In Pursuit of Happiness'. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it an 8 for the pure fun factor to it. If you plan to spare 2 hours of your holiday on it, the chances are you will not be disappointed.",8,1,6,14 December 2007
The Artist," An analogue admirer's analysis
","After waiting for about 2 months since I first watched the trailer and more than 5 since I first heard about it, I finally managed to watch 'The Artist'. Between then and the night before last, I've grown accustomed to hearing only the superlatives and most glorious adjectives in reference to the movie. Although none from my close friends, I am referring to my favourite pastimes like Facebook, Twitter, American Cinematography Magazine, Total Film, Time Magazine to just name a few. Apart from setting unimaginable expectations in the sub conscious, it did generate a sense of delirious excitement in me, while I sat down for the experience. Here's what I think, how it fared.The Artist is an accomplished piece of work that should / would appeal to a wide spectrum of cine goers across the world. But 'a lump in the throat' is reserved for the absolute fanatic of the craft. In my books, I consider myself a member of such a make belief club. Before I indulge in the sparkles and the fireworks, the movie managed to create while watching it and right after, let me get into some of the facts.This is as much as some may hate to accept, is a French production shot on location in Los Angeles and includes various craftsmen from both French cinema and Hollywood. But in true heart and soul this is an American story of the industry that sells dreams and most successfully so.There have been many stories about it in the past and so will be in future; that may have or will manage to tell it successfully and some not so much. The Artist, I perceive will have a special place amongst them all, a first among equals if You'd like. At a time, where the advent and renaissance of 'Social Media' has brought fans of cinema and the ones who don the grease paints to unbelievable and sometimes unacceptable proximities, the process has inadvertently led to considerable degeneration of the mist that surrounds them and their lives outside the spot light, between 'cut' and 'action'. And at such times, 'The Artist' is a breath of fresh air and works as a reminiscent of what movies right after its conception, stood for. A celebration of one such art form, from one such factory that has outlived itself in many ways in the past millennium. he story itself is about an indispensable act of nature, 'change' and how it affects the one's who take success and in this case fame and admiration for permanency or as some would call it, granted. In life as much as in the world of glamour, nothing is constant. The protagonist's fights with his inner demons about accepting change is projected in the simplest of manners which is why it works. Research of how it worked in the 1920′s and technical excellence in achieving the feel of those times more than the costume, make up and body language which we have come to expect of movies these days, makes it a product par excellence. The fact that the makers shot it at 22 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps, helped them achieve what they did and is a serious case in point. Although its USP, 'a silent film' will manage to draw the crowds and more so with all the nominations it has been getting, what would make them savour the experience is, how good it is, at it. Michel Hazanavicius who held this dream / passion project close to his heart for long before it came true chose his confidants for the lead roles, Jean Dujardin & Berenice Bejo (who also happens to be his better half). They have achieved major success in the OSS 117 series in France before this. Along with that some very familiar faces that constitutes the important players list includes the likes of John Goodman & James Cromwell who by the way pull off excellent character roles pivotal to the story line. Special mention to Uggy the Dog, who by the way has his own IMDb page now. But by and large Jean Dujardin with his impeccable sense of timing besides an affable charm, the original score produced by Lodovic Bource and performed by Brussels Philharmonic and most of all, Michel Hazanavicius who did not have to depend only on intertiles to tell a silent story, should be held high, very high in respect to what they have given us, the fans. Come February 26th, people who watch movies and follow them for what it is worth, will wait to see if 'The Artist' stakes claims at the 10 Oscar categories it has been nominated for (including BEST Picture). My only concern is, people should not give it a miss if it does not get some of them 'Gold Statuettes' in the bag because for once, let's not make The Academy the yardstick of its excellence and achievements. Martin Scorsese for all I care should have earned it long before for far better works than 'The Departed', for which he did. Lets for once, stand up and applaud 'The Artist' wherever You are, until it deafens the ears that have grown accustomed to appreciation of the mediocre, because this one is not it. It is quiet truly and literally if I may, in a league of its own.Check out more review http://mayurdeep.com",9,5,8,8 February 2012
30 Days of Night," NUTSHELL Review
","The heavy expectations of any enterprise, is its biggest downfall. I guess that sums up the whole experience of 30 Days of Night.If you go into the movie to get your wits jolted or to feel that cold sweat trip down your forehead, you are more likely to come out disappointed. Having said that, it scores some browny points in another genre. ACTION. It is one of the more decent action movies to have come out this year. Knowing that we had '300', 'Transformers' and the latest installment of the 'Die Hard' series all release this year, thats saying a lot.The thing that worked for me the most is that it does not try to be over the top complicated with serious plots and unexpected twists. It is pure fun, blood, gore. Not as much as the new acclaimed runaway cult hits like the 'SAW' & 'HOSTEL' series but still manages to pack a decent punch.So my final word for the ones who have waited for this to see the light of the day (pun intended), like their life depended on it. Do not walk in to quench your thirst to get yourself soaking wet with terror filled images. But if you are looking for a fun filled action ride, stylishly shot, 30 Days of Night might just do the trick for you !!!",6,2,4,13 November 2007
300," Rich & Exhausting...
","Sometimes it does wonders when you enter a theater with mixed expectations. More so when you don't know much about the Greeks, not that I care much about history.Well first things first. This will go down as one of the best visual treats one would ever experience on a silver screen. The frequent 'oohs' and 'aahs' every now on then in the crowd, goes on to prove that everyone was engaged throughout the runtime of the enterprise. The fight sequences are enthralling and anyone who is interested in the craft of movie making would understand that the crew, on as well as behind the screen shed that extra drop of sweat to get exactly what they aspired.With a war movie involving kings and queens, comparisons to past giants like The Gladiator and Braveheart is inevitable. But make no mistake, 300 is as much a thoroughly enjoyable piece of art as any of its predecessors.Do yourself a favor, watch 300 on a Sunday afternoon even if it means overlooking your backlog of errands that you have been pushing off to this particular weekend for ages now. It will be worth it!",10,6,12,11 March 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," A shot in the arm to the horror genre
","I walked into the theater with very little expectation, besides a dormant penchant of some cheap thrills and chills. But the one thing that kept coming to my mind, while going through the pre-show commercials, was what Total Film called it in one of their past month editions : 'reinventing the horror genre'. While that may not mean much or anything at all, my subconscious self was yearning for something interesting, minus the torture gores of Eli Roth and his counterparts, that I detest.The Cabin In The Woods, through its trailers, shouts out aloud that here is a movie that you've seen it all before, and just like what you've come to expect by now, we too have twists, and turns and surprises along the way. In the movie though, what does stand apart by almost a telling yard is that, these twists and turns come to life in the narration, a lot earlier than you'd have anticipated and follows a coherent motive of surprising the viewer, the moment conventional wisdom looked to be the order of the day. Drew Goddard and Josh Whedon wrote a good story but the former, directed it even better. The acting was a well oiled support group that left no stone unturned in exploiting every given opportunity at pulling off histrionics, that such scripts provide. Special mention to the Fran Kranz, who I am told has been a regular in Wheddon's past works. As a nerdy, dope head, his weed act is the catalyst of this experiment and serves the flavour sumptuously with a long ending after taste. There is also no doubt that post Thor and the soon to be released pre-summer blockbuster 'The Avengers', Chris Hemsworth's stock price is on the rise. & that will do a world of good, in pulling the Youtube demography into buying cinema tickets for this cabin.Jenkins & Whitford were pitch perfect Overall, if entertainment was the yardstick to a film's success, The Cabin In The Woods, is an assured and comprehensive winner. Its a shot in the arm to the horror genre. It'd be a crying shame if the most cynical follower of such movies would have anything to complain about this one. In my attempt at not giving too much away, I'd just say that the elaborate climax and all the mayhem that the proceedings give into, all mixed at a tastefully timed pace, should keep you glued to the edge of your seats for minutes that seem to be never ending. The humour quotient is immaculately placed in the entire narration and is never used as a tension diffuser. Such was the balance between perception and truth of the premise, that I had people in my cinema guffaw and shriek in the same scene in a matter of seconds. And I consider them both, bloody genuine reactions. As a film enthusiast I can only imagine the kind of fun the makers and everybody involved in the project may have had. Speaking of which. A homage, although sometimes projected as unintentional, has rarely missed my sights. The opening credits have a subtle touch of Tarantino's flair about them. & the look of the cabin itself and a few other sequences will remind you of Sam Raimi's original Evil Dead. Now you know what we're talking As you can imagine, being compared to past classics that have done their bits in reviving a genre that sometimes produces overdose of solemn and mournful, can be a great thing. There are times when we tend to take going ons far too seriously and forget that its actually just a movie. If you're one of them, the likelihood of you coming out of the theater feeling shortchanged is very high.So my word of advice, in the words of Mr. S from 'School of Rock' is that loosen those hinges on your shoulder, go loosey – goosey, grab your popcorn & soda and find the time to go watch this hilariously frightening piece of work, that has cult written all over it. Look, if not now; than at least in another 10 years perhaps ?Recommended for the Horror & Thriller lovers. 4/5",8,1,8,29 April 2012
