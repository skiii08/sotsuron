Your Name.," My favourite animated film
","I have seen a lot of anime and animated movies throughout my 30 years, and there are so many great films to recommend, but for me, Your Name is the crowning jewel. I can think of no other anime film that tops it.It is so beautiful in every way, truly a masterclass in creativity and humanity.Emotionally, it wrenched me and left my jaw dropped for much of the film.You simply must watch this on the best quality and largest screen you can find. It's a feast for the senses, and just go in blind without any foreknowledge.",10,0,0,11 January 2020

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's worst movie
","Ughhh... what boring contrived garbage!I'm not atall fan of this new highly-politicised Tarantino. His better work was up to and including Kill Bill, and since then he just kept getting more and more heavy-handed with the Hollywood political schlock. Inglourious Basterds was entertaining and well made sure, but the Nazi stuff felt very grubby, anachronistic and Hollywood-pleasing. Same goes for Django Unchained, also entertaining but very much pushing the modern Hollywood narrative, and very anachronistic. Hateful Eight was okay, decent enough for one viewing but obnoxiously slow, and not rewatchable atall. Again, very politically charged and anachronistic.Then comes Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. Only a few minutes into the film and I was already unimpressed and bored with the flowery self-indulgent dialogue. And then comes that Nazi scene. Ughhh. What is it with Hollywood needing to pump out endless Nazi-killing schlock? It's so boring and contrived. If Tarantino actually had some guts and went for some over the top Jew-killing stuff, just to balance it out, would Hollywood be as eager to lather him with 10 Oscar nominations like they've just now on with Once Upon? Probably not.Since Kill Bill, I had hoped that Tarantino would continue to at least try to produce interesting and different movies, but sadly he became infected with the same fungus that engulfs pretty much all of Hollywood these days. The kind of fungus that likes to poke fun at specific people and get praised for it, but never has the guts to poke fun of other types of people that seem to be protected. I'm specifically talking about the trend of making mockery and bad guys out of White people, but never Black people or Jewish people (who are always the victims). Nazis are always the bad guys, and never the good guys. Americans and Jews are always the good guys and never the bad guys. Don't even dare proposing a film which challeneges this narrative, or you could end up in jail. The only places you can see German perspectives during WW2 are in heavily-suppressed documentaries, and never in mainstream media. Why is this? This year there are two movies nominated for the Best Film oscar which involve Nazi-killing and mockery (Once Upon, and Jojo Rabbit).I challenge Tarantino to have some guts, and make a movie about Nazis being the good guys. No mainstream filmmaker has ever done this. Tarantino could be the one filmmaker actually with enough clout to pull it off. Dig into actual history and tell it like it really happened, not how the victors have rewritten history to portray themselves as the good guys and the Nazis as monsters, when Germany's actions were in self-defense against the combined superpowers of the age (Russia, America, France, UK, and Rothschilds).I say all this as a keen student of history, with a desire for a more balanced understanding of recent history to become mainstream, instead of the endless garbage and falsehoods that Hollywood churns out.",4,2,2,14 January 2020
Schindler's List," Historically false.
",Historically wrong. Watch the documentaries The Greatest Story Never Told and Europa The Last Battle,1,17,43,1 February 2019
Schindler's List," Fiction studied and consumed as Fact
",Schools all over the world force young children to study this fictional movie in history class. The book which the movie is based on clearly states that it is a work of fiction. Yet the movie is consumed and studied as historical fact.Imagine if a mainstream movie about the Jewish Israelis' treatment of the Palestinians were to be made and then forced into historical study for children. Would the country of Israel be permitted to exist? I think not.Germany's role in WW2 is grossly misrepresented to the masses by movies such as Schindler's List.,1,10,27,11 January 2020
La La Land," Should have won the Best Film Oscar
","La La Land is clearly better than Moonlight in every way. I am baffled how the Academy thought Moonlight could even be considered for a nomination.What can I say beyond just that I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It's beautifully made, and wonderfully acted. White an affecting movie that stays with you for a long time afterwards.",9,4,5,13 January 2020
Joker," Overrated 'Wag the Dog' level of media-hype
","Meh, it's okay. Joaquin's decent acting is the only redeeming part. His acting isn't the best I've seen, and is quite overrated in this also. I think Adam Driver in Marriage Story deserves the Oscar a lot more.The movie Joker is okay. It's defintely not worth the 11 Oscars it was nominated for. Several superb movies were snubbed for nominations this year which would have certainly denied Joker of the nominations it got.The media storm surrounding Joker is quite perplexing, as there is absolutely nothing remarkable or boundary-pushing about it. It seems that media storm was a 'Wag the Dog' operation to drive attention to it, which makes a lot of sense given that it has now been nominated for 11 Oscars.I like Joaquin's advocacy for animal rights and veganism, and for that purpose I would be happy for him to get the attention he's getting. But as for pure acting performance, Adam Driver is the clear frontrunner in my opinion.",6,3,6,14 January 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Best standalone movie ever made
","Shawshank truly is the best-made standalone movie of all time.As much as I might like the extended Lord of the Rings trilogy more overall, as for singularly movies, nothing tops Shawshank.",10,1,1,14 January 2020
Parasite," The clear Oscar frontrunner
","This year the Academy Awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual. Not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies, but over-ladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve.Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - 10 Oscar noms. (why?)
Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)Parasite? 6. (all deserved).Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world. I highly recommend it.",10,29,48,14 January 2020
Marriage Story," Painful and hard to watch, in a good way
","Adam Driver deserves the Oscar win. He is the clear frontrunner imo.The movie itself is really good, albeit with an unsatisfying ending.I cried throughout the movie. It really hit me hard, as I can very much relate to the situations presented, particularly as my parents divorced when I was 2. All the pain and upheaval was well captured in this movie, especially by Adam Driver (one of my fav actors) who gives the performance of his career.",9,6,9,14 January 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan kinda forgot how to make a great movie
","This film started out pretty good, but just kept getting dumber and more cringey, on the nose, and corny. There were plenty of strong points, but they were increasingly outweighed by bad writing, awful cinematography, and wasted potential. The strong points of this movie were almost on par with The Dark Knight, but disappointingly the movie just became laughable and nonsensical.Watch the movie more than once and you will see what I mean. I would say this is the weakest of Nolan's Batman trilogy, with The Dark Knight the clear frontrunner.",7,1,4,20 January 2020
