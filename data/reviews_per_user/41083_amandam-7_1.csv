Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Social commentary? Or an excuse for perversion?
","A serious warning for anyone who thinks this movie could be an interesting 'social commentary'. It isn't! The preview misleads viewers into thinking that we will experience a funny look at our culture from a new perspective. Although some parts do accurately portray the North American mindset, it appears that Sacha Baron Cohen has simply created a character shock value. The plot was weak, revolving around the main character's desire to marry Pamela Anderson, and to discuss his obsession with vaginas. Enough said. This film has no substance, no purpose, and above all, more nude men in compromising positions than I have ever wanted to see. I give the film a 2/10 for the amount of times I laughed during the entire film: twice. It definitely was not 'one of the funniest movies ever made' as advertised.",2,7,14,13 November 2006
