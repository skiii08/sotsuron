Catch Me If You Can," A terrible film from a director who should know better
","Spielberg has made some awful films in his long career (AI for one) but this is by far his worst. Its such a shame because the guy is obviously highly talented, doesn't need the cash, and should have the confidence in his own abilities and the audience not to need to stoop to Disney techniques in order to embellish a great, true story. So many things just didn't add up, particularly in some of the characterisations - the young girl's parents, for instance, just weren't the type to have thrown her out of the house when they found she was pregnant. No, reality really is better than fiction and all those things that Spielberg added in a naive attempt to interest the audience were just the things which turned them off. And, oh, what was that awful boring, long, pastiche of a title sequence at the front? Most of the audience were asleep, or talking, before they saw the first frame of the story. Hollywood yet again gets it wrong.",1,8,25,3 February 2003
The Da Vinci Code," Workmanlike and mechanical with no human chemistry
","Another mechanical production from the hands of Ron Howard. I was worried when I heard he was the chosen director for this project and although its been well shot and tells the story reasonably well, the acting is mechanical and lifeless like all his other films. I'm sure he's a nice bloke but its somewhat surprising that for a lifelong actor, the acting is always his weakest element. There's some poor casting in my opinion too. Audrey Tautou,Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany didn't do much for me and were particularly poor. In fact Paul Bettany was the only 'over the top' character and slightly embarrassing at moments. Hans Zimmer's music was fantastic as always but it couldn't compensate for the workmanlike direction. A missed opportunity which would have been handled much better by another director. A shame.",2,19,40,19 May 2006
Gangs of New York," Scorsese does Disney
","By far and away Martin Scorsese's worst film. However, he's such a great director, I'll forgive him. This was history by Disney and if he'd backed off and not tried to make an epic history film it could have been OK. He should have narrowed down his canvas to a much smaller one and concentrated on just a fwe characters. But he tried to stuff the whole history of New York into a simplistic storyline. The characters weren't believable and Daniel Day Lewis did a remarkable job with terrible materaial. Put this down to experience Marty and promise never again to do history - leave it to Disney.",1,17,38,19 January 2003
Donnie Darko," A precocious debut on the scale of Welles' Citizen Kane
","This is a great film made by a great film director. No one would ever guess that this masterpiece was a first film made by a 27 year old. Besides a great script, the acting is first class and there is a true sophistication in the use of the camera, the editing and all round detail of the production. Phew.....wish I'd made it !! PS And its not about a dysfunctional boy who has visions of a giant bunny - its about what goes through your head when you're at the point of death.",10,0,1,2 November 2002
Atonement," Great story handled inconsistently
","The bits I liked first. Both the leads were better than I'd anticipated, particularly Kiera, who I've not had much time for as her previous attempts have been stilted and wooden in some cases. She's matured into a nice actress and her part came across as very believable. James McAvoy likewise did a great job although his accent was quite variable. Vanessa Redgrave was simply stunning. Her role was made difficult because it was so small and so important. Every moment had to be convincing and it was perfectly judged. I hadn't read the book which I'm glad about and I shall now go out and buy it. The story was fabulous with a stunning ending which I think would have been spoiled if you'd already read the book. This needs to be a shock and I'd imagine its anticipation would only water its effects down. What wasn't so good was the directors inconsistent handling of the script. There were some nice scenes when the two leads played together but there were also too many scenes that were heavy handed and a few quite laughable. The most expensive scene in the film on the Dunquerk beach was horrendously camp and self aware which was a shame. You could almost see the AD's q'ing the cast, horse and dog handlers and viz effects guys. There was also some dodgy casting and the guy who married Lola needed a quick word in his ear about his woodeness. It's probably not in the book but I would have liked a few more scenes of the two leads together to show their attraction to one another. We needed a little more detail of their depth of feeling so their separation is more poignant. Overall the film was a little frustrating because with a better director it could have been a great film but his heavy handedness got in the way too many times.",5,9,19,10 September 2007
