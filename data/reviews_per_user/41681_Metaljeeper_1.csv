Lucky Number Slevin," Pleasantly Surprised (small spoiler warning)
","I never thought I'd see the day I would like a film starring Josh Hartnett, but Morgan Freeman stole the show! This film has plenty of surprises lurking around various corners, a strong line-up of actors, one plot going head on against another plot, Ben Kingsley with a beat-up accent and the sexy and beautiful Lucy Liu.I like to think that Stanley Tucci could have done more with his character, or maybe he just can't pull off the 'bad cop' routine, and Bruce Willis got to use what he learned during The Jackal.If you like movies like Snatch and Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, this is a must see for you.",8,0,5,7 June 2006
