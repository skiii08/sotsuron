Alien 3," Good film....BUT!!!
","Caution: A spoiler or two!I thought Alien 3 was good way to end the series. Some people might not like this film because it's not so action packed like ALIENS and their some periods where the movie is a bit slow plus Hicks and Newt are killed off right in the middle of the beginning credits. What really URKS me though is the way Newt died. In the movie, she drowns in her cryotube...okay..sure that can happen! But if that's how she died, then, how in the world did Ripley manage to survive the crash into the ocean when we see a big gapping hole on her face plate during the opening credits(if you take a good look during the opening credits you'll see that the part of the glass of her cryotube is shattered where her face is) before the big plunge. Ripley should have drowned too dying with the others...heh, end of Alien 3 after 2 minutes, LOL!   Anyway, the only explanations I could think of were, one, very very BAD editing, or two, the directors were THAT desperate to get Newt out of the picture and made a cheap shot at it! I really did like Alien 3. However, Newt dying from cryotube malfunctions would have made much more sence and probobly would have been a little more excepted by viewers. Alien 3 is a great tragic film showing how the alien has effected Ripley's life, taking away everyone she loves. But parts of the beginning are not balanced and I'm surpised the directors didn't catch this glitch before releasing the film. So what did Ripley do while under water...hold her breath?????",Null,1,2,23 November 2001
