Casablanca," Too saccharine for me.
","I admit that most films before 1960 usually leave me cold since the acting is almost always stagy but I though I'd give this and The Maltese Falcon a chance.  Oh well.  VERY stagy acting, with an awful, pretentious soundtrack. It all came off as rather silly.  I just couldn't buy any of it.  I get the same impression from any film by Kazan.",1,25,100,25 May 2000
Meet the Parents," I can't believe that DeNiro was actually in this turkey!
","Basically a bad ripoff of another bad film (There's Something About Mary). It should be retitled 'There's Something About The Father of the Bride.' Every joke is telegraphed and every scene is just as contrived as can be. Stiller's performance as the unlucky suitor is ok but we've seen it before and it's getting old.  Unless you're a Police Academy fan or REALLY liked that Mary movie, avoid this one at all costs.",1,11,20,6 December 2000
We Were Soldiers," Flag waving drivel.
","Just about any war movie cliche you can think of was in this one.  When Mel is having his heart to heart with the daughter, I knew this film was going to blow.  Not even Spielberg would get this sappy and ridiculous.  Sam Elliot was the only saving grace.  However I did find it amusing that they painted Julia Roberts lips on Madeline Stowe.  I guess Julia wanted too much money.",2,2,5,4 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," Dense? Yes. Confusing? Maybe. Impenetrable? Not at all! (possible spoiler)
","After reading numerous reviews both good and bad, I went to see this film and it totally knocked me out!  From start to finish it just had me spellbound.  But what amazes me now is that after having seen it, I'm puzzled as to why some of these 'sophisticated' movie critics missed the boat so badly on the story of this film.Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, said that his show was designed so that the viewer would be rewarded for paying attention.  Mulholland Drive requires exactly that: complete attention ALL THE WAY TO THE END!  (spoiler approaching) A lot of these critics should take the time to watch Pulp Fiction again to get a sense of what directors can do with narrative time lines.  In fact, Lynch gives more than adequate clues as to what he's up to with total corn-ball dialogue in the beginning, the soft focus for the first two thirds and the little 'cracks in the veneer' such as the dog turd in the court yard (contrasting the family-like apartment home), the bitchy casting agent (contrasting the overly nice producer).  But what's most important is understanding the nature or dreams and fantasy verses reality.  Lynch demonstrates this beautifully!But what I admire the most about this film is that Lynch has the audacity and nerve to challenge the viewer and to require him/her to interpret and ponder and THINK!  Such an achievement can only come from an uncompromising dedication to a personal vision which is the source of nearly all great art. So like all great art, it needs to be studied, thought about and talked about(!) to be really appreciated.Mulholland Drive and Memento are probably the ONLY thought provoking films released this year and I'm grateful that a guy like David Lynch had the balls to make it.",9,1,1,15 October 2001
