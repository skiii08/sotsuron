Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the funniest films of 06 and thats not saying much
","This film was great. It is not a classic, but still one very funny one. If u r offended easily then this one isn't for u. One of the best films of the year , hopefully up for an Oscar. thanks GO out and see it! The film was directed and filmed with what seemed like very cheep cameras especially in the bus scene. It holds its on throughout the movie. It is the best mock documentary I have ever seen. It did kinda loss steam at the end. THe Pamela Anderson scene looked somewhat staged. Anyhow if your looking for a laugh don't miss this one. The critics loved it and so did I. If u like his show, take your time and go see this one. It is a different movie that really works.One of the funniest films of 06 and thats not saying much.",10,3,15,7 November 2006
Spider-Man 3," Very disappointing.
","First off I like to point out that I loved spiderman and spiderman 2. They two terrific films. This on the other is just not. It's very sub par. Although it was bad their were some alright moments. Here's a good break down.Good Moments- All of the action sequences are very well done. Topher Grace does a terrific job as Eddie Brock. All the other actors are fine expect for Tobey. Here comes the bad.Bad- The script, it goes everywhere with out going anywhere. By this I mean it touches a lot of subjects, such as introducing Venom, Sandman, Eddie Brock,and Gwen Stacy. It tries but, it fails to hit all the plot points well. Spiderman dancing was also pretty bad. It didn't feel like Spiderman, it felt like the filmmakers were making a joke of Spiderman with terrible dialog and cheesy scenes. Sandman wasn't that cool either. I don't want to ruinin it , but they try to show that he is good guy. It doesn't work. Tobey Maguire is bad in this movie. Not as the normal Read Suit Spiderman, but as the black suited Spiderman. He tries to act cool and still acts dorky. Score wasn't as good. Overall: If you liked the other two than you will despise this. Okay you might like it, but it is by far the weakest in the series. Please don't go see it. Rebel this awful film. I hate to say it, but is the most disappointing pre- summer movie and probably of 2007. Overall 1/5",2,2,4,9 May 2007
