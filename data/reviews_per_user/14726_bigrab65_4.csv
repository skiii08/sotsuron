Vertigo," Great in every way
","Some Hitchcock films can be viewed by some as little more than thrillers.  A case in point is Rear Window.  This is not the case for Vertigo, through and through a work of art cinema. What makes this film stand out is how Hitchcock uses all of the film-makers to perfection: acting, storyline, music, editing and so forth. The film's use of lighting is excellent throughout, always echoing in some way the psychological state of the characters.  The graveyard scene, where Hitchcock used fog filters, is one of the best examples of this.  The fog effect gives the viewers a number of different feelings: the obvious is to give a ghostly atmosphere to the scene.  It also gives you the sense of ambiguity about Stewart's actions at this point of the film. The film features arguably the most dramatic ending in the history of cinema.  What we have here is every aspect of film-making coming together, with Stewart acting at perhaps a level of intensity that has rarely been matched before and since.  The film famously ends with Kim Novak dying, however why is this the case? Vertigo is effectively split into two halves, before and after Stewart thinks Novak has died.  What is clear is that these two halves are rather like an image that has been reflected and rotated in some way.  We have Stewart now making over Novak's character.  Stewart making it to the top of the stairs and so forth.  It is this type of role reversal that requires Novak to die.  This of course is hinted at by the rotation of the opening credits by Bass.",10,2,4,8 August 2003
The Pianist," Vastly over-rated and highly simplistic
","With a rating of 95 percent at Rotten Tomatoes and a place in the top 50 at IMDB I was expecting this to be a challenging film about the Holocaust. This however was not it.  All this film says about the Holocaust was that life was tough then, little else.  This is a rather obvious truth for everyone except Holocaust deniers, so why spend two hours telling us this. The film has story that is much too conventional and one that unfortunately lacks any great meaning.The depiction of the Germans is perhaps the most straightforward you are likely to see.  All you get is a bunch of stereotypical cinematic Nazis without any subtlety, until the final twenty minutes, when, SPOILER, Spillman runs into perhaps the only good German in all of Poland, if you go by the depiction of the Germans up to this point, who allows Spillman to escape.This film simply alludes to some major questions instead of going into any depth.  It shows a Jewish character who was from a certain point of view helping the Nazis, yet we do not see why this character is doing what he is doing.  At least not in any depth.One of the most remarkable things about this film is that it is about a Pianist, someone you would expect would have a soul.  However, Spillman is simply a non-character which makes him being a pianist seem rather superfluous.  This, however like the rather brief reference to the Merchant of Venice seems to be Polanski's main tool in this film: to allude to things that are deep and worthwhile, while saying nothing of the sort himself.A brief glimpse through some of the reviews will find that a lot of critics have a rather simplistic view of the Third Reich, which may explain why they liked this rather simplistic film.  One critic wrote that the Nazis were for barbarism and challenged everything that was beautiful and pure.  This in turn would lead them to oppose Spillman and his profession: the professional pianist.  This, however is not a rather simplistic view of the Nazi regime. The music that the Nazis opposed most strongly was modern music, in particularly the atonalism of the sort written by the great composer Schoenberg.  This music was viewed by the Nazis as being crude.  Hitler, himself was Wagner fanatic.  However, the issue of Wagner opens up a lot of major historical issues that I can't go into.  If, as some film critics are implying that this film is saying these things about the Third Reich, then I think this is a sad reflection of the intellectual state of modern critics. Although we may find The Third Reich totally repulsive we must not take the simplistic that it was a place where all great music was neglected, with the same being true for the Soviet Union.  These regimes had a particular view of what was great in music, and a lot of these composers, the German composers admired by the Nazis and the Russian composers who worked within the Soviet regime are greats in music.  The important thing to realise is that these regimes idealised music and other works of art and that is where the problem lies.  The thinking behind this was quite often quite complex, with thinkers such as Hegel leading the way. Personally, I thought that the film made no such comment on the Third Reich, but if it did I find little validity in it.",3,13,37,23 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Film improves with second viewing
","When watching this for the first time I felt that the final hour was flawed. These problems however are not as important on second viewing.  The main issue is that of editing.  The battle of Helm's Deep is clearly the major set piece of the film, however it is unfortunately interrupted by other scenes, that is those involving Merry, Pippen and Frodo.  These interruptions lead to a clear loss in momentum and tension.  When you watch this film again though the problem is not that important, because on repeat viewings you are concerned less with tension anyway and focus more on the vision of the film makers.One of the most interesting things about the endings is how dark it is. When first viewing the film it is easy to come away thinking that it had ended in a happy, and perhaps overly sentimental manner.  This is so if you take away the film's final five minutes.  However the scene of Gollum and Smeagol deciding to kill Frodo and Sam is at almost polar opposites to the scene involving Frodo and Sam which came before and means that we should be able to look forward to a final film which isn't just a plain action film, but relying  equally on characterisation and visual artistry.",10,0,0,23 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Total contradiction of first film
","We end the first film with Neo giving this speech about opening peoples minds and showing them a world without rules and all this stuff.  Then at the beginning of this film we basically have Neo, Morpheus and co. walking around the Matrix doing exactly the same thing as before, yest never showing the people in the Matrix that they live in the Matrix.  In the first film Morpheus didn't stand a chance against an agent.  Now, he can kick there asses with little difficulty.  The kung fu was completely pointless, because Neo was always fighting people for no reason.  Check out the scene where they are Neo and co. are trying to get the Keymaster away from the French guy.  If Keanu had a brain he would realise that: A. He doesn't need to fight these stock Joel Silver heavies and B. He could just fly away with the Keymaster and we wouldn't need this stupid freeway chase which could lead to the destruction of mankind.  This film it appears to have been written by some 14 year old disaffected teenager, who has seen nothing more than cliche ridden garbage his entire life and of course a bit of the Phantom Menace. Instead of giving these losers 300 mil to make a film, give them 300 dollars to attend one of those script-writing courses Donald Kaufmann was on in Adaptation.  Some of Donald's ideas were better than this pile of rubbish.",2,0,0,23 May 2003
