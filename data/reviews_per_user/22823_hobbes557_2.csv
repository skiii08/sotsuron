Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Amazing Animation
","People really don't appreciate the talent and dedication it takes to animate, especially what this movie does.  The animation in this movie is amazing, and I make this statement as a person  who has tried their hand at animation.  (okay  claymation,  but it's all similar) Modern movies boast that they have over 1000 special effects shots, but this movie contains over 5000.  This movie should be a legend simply for the amazing technical skills it took to create it.  Not to mention the fact that it is just a great movie all around.  Good plot, funny and understandable to children, but lots of subtle humor for adults.  And the newest dvd is great.  This movie deserves more attention than it is given.",9,2,2,30 July 2003
Alien," The Yardstick
","This movie is the yardstick by which other Alien movies are measured. That's it, plain and simple.  I've heard that people find this movie boring or slow, and to that I say 'bah!'.  This movie is not an action movie, nor is it meant to be.  It is a suspense movie, and an excellent example of one. The cast is great, the story well written, and the scenery adds a grisly, metallic, 'film noir' theme to the picture.  If at all possible, see this movie in theaters, there was recently a re-release, and it might still be out on some screens.  Seeing this movie on the big screen is an experience all in itself, and it is one of the few so-called 'scary' movies I've seen that actually have a few parts which made me jump.  I'm not going to say which though, I'm opposed to putting spoilers in reviews, its unnecessary and just plain rude.  An excellent film all around.P.S. If you haven't seen either Alien or Aliens, see this one first, I saw Aliens first, and didn't understand a few things.  Seeing Alien first explains alot.",Null,0,1,24 March 2004
