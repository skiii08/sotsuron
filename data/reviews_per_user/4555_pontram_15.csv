Angels & Demons," My small little bashing....
","....comes late, and will probably not be read by someone. But suddenly I remembered this movie, which I was watching months ago, together with my 16 year old son. As we missed Star Trek 11, I was very surprised about the first few minutes of this movie, which are offering a high-budget science fiction action flick. This part was very well done, I didn't expect a movie that is taking itself very seriously and confronts us with a ready-to-use antimatter bomb. Which can be handled like an alarm clock. Not even the most courageous James Bond dared such a nonsense, but it was all made very well and fast and expensive, so I wasn't annoyed. But I cannot help to mention that we are as far from antimatter technology like weekend houses for everyone on Jupiter. Now, I know, this is fictional, and a simple H-Bomb would be too boring (and too big to carry in the handbag), I simply assimilated to the fairy tale.Next, Tom Hanks showed up, and I wondered where this movie would go. Because there came such bored and numb vibes from him that suddenly I felt the inevitable need to sleep. Where the wonderful pictures of Rome and wonderful arranged interiors passed, my lids got heavier and heavier with ever scene with Tom Hanks. I assumed, he has a disease, where the face gets stiff, or he has had a little Botox therapy, that made every existing ability (even those small of Tom's) to act or expressing feelings impossible.So I decided not to fight against a wonderful short sleep and let go for about ten refreshing minutes, until my son gave me a little punch.After that little dozing, which is an approach I recommend to every viewer of this movie seriously, when I first saw that Blondie Ewan McGregor, I knew for sure he is the bad guy and he is in charge for everything bad. I liked this. It's nice for our children, and so the money spent is not wasted.The first real fun for me was my beloved Armin-Müller-Stahl, who plays the bad guy (and should distract from the real bad and blonde guy) like he plays every guy and like every actor with such charisma plays his characters - as Armin-Müller-Stahl himself, with his Stahl-gray eyes and his Stahl-gentle Voice (in my country resynchronized by himself), which is his most powerful weapon.That held me awake for the rest of the movie, waiting for Armins next appearance.The ending was absolute unbelievable for me, and I wondered why not the others were jumping up from their seats and throw foul eggs onto the screen. Then I realized that nobody goes to the cinema with foul eggs. But at least....maybe one person except me could remember, that 'little boy' destroyed Hiroshima from about 600m meters altitude; this height was found ideal to kill as many people as possible. In a distance of about 4 Kilometers from detonation point trees caught fire, and so on... And there is someone who wants to tell me that this antimatter bomb was so, so dangerous ? A fairy tale, all right. I'm a SF-Fan, and so I will not blame the makers for their efforts to make cash with nonsense; most cash in the world is made so.At least, I told myself later, there were nice impressions of Rome. A little expensive for a postcard, but never mind. My son enjoyed it. Maybe next year we visit Vatican together....",5,0,0,4 November 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Laughed to exhaustion
","Watching this movie I almost had to leave cinema hall because I had to laugh so much, i nearly couldn't stand it.Thanks to my decision, I saw it in original version, no sync, no subtitles, and that I recommend to everyone. German synced version isn't half as funny (it can't).Why is it so funny ? Because it's political incorrect, vicious, devious and spares no-one, audience included.And I don't remember any moment where Sacha Baron Cohen, who may not be the most sympathetic man, isn't fully believable as the heartwarming childish character he plays. He looks fully authentically Kaszakh, although is he is from UK. That's very devious, because most people do not know Kazakhstanis, but do accept him as such one.This movie was very cheap and earned it's production costs ($ 18M) nearly 15 times ($ 261 M). Rightfully.",10,0,0,16 June 2011
Star Trek," Star Trek Goes Kajal and Cloverfield
","I never saw in a movie from the period of color and sound that much Kajal on the actors eyes, except in Fellini's Satyricon. When I noticed first that Kirk's lid-margins are heavily painted with black Kajal, I took a closer look on the others - and I was astonished that there must have been used some kilograms, like in an old silent movie, because almost all lids are painted. So far, so strange.That concludes the biggest impression the movie made on me, except disappointment. I always hope for good new SF movies, and although I am a Trek fan I am open for new and unusual approaches. I enjoyed ST:ENT more than TOS, and i compassionate its termination much more than any other's from the trek universe. The same with Farscape and Firefly for the non-Trek lines.I hoped that this new movie will break the line of the soapy and faithfully TNG. And so it does, but in a very unpleasant manner. Awaiting a new and astonishing voyage with new ideas and visions, instead, I got old and stale time hopping stories with logical errors and plot holes as big as gas giants. After Nero's appearance the movie died for me. And Nero appears very early. After it is revealed that he's a miner, his invincible ship is obviously around a driller, and he waited 25 years (without doing anything than masterbating together with his comrades, I assume) for the unsure appearance of tottery old Spock (who could also come 250 or 250000 years later) through a singularity that was deployed without any need, because the supernova it should prevent already destroyed Nero's planet, I had to switch off my brain immediately to prevent suffering permanent damage (until there I let it run in a kind of power-saving state), after Kirk met Spock by accident on an icy world, which is within sight of Vulcan, but unaffected by it's cataclysmic Nero-initiated disappearance. Fortunately, because we learned then that there is something called trans-warp-beaming, which would eradicate any need for any further action except trans-warping a big grenade into Nero's vessel and make it boom (to hell with ol' Pike), and so on and on...I personally hate the shaky cam, I feel no increasing realism. Shaky cam is for private holiday movies, in reality my view of the world is compensated by my brain and steady even when the bus driver goes bananas. Why did the Trek world blame Shatner for his use of hand cameras in ST5, and why do they praise Abrams for the same now ?Furthermore, I had the impression that the production team had no love for their product. They made a brainless action trip around a bunch of youngsters, because youngsters on the big screen will draw youngstersWith cash-flow into the theaters, whatever rubbish is running there. Starting from there, they had no need to put some pieces of storytelling or sense for atmosphere into their bland soup. Yes, action here, action there, action everywhere, and some jokes for the IQ-60 audience. The Ninja Transformer Turtles are wearing Star Fleet uniforms, brouhaha.The best in this movie is Spock's father. His figure is a real improvement as it is the first time he is allowed to show that he has a relation to his son. The actor is perfectly chosen for his part.Kirk himself is also not bad in some scenes, but his quality as a 3d-chess player who can beat even Spock, I mean his gaming intelligence, is not shown in the least. He is simple a ruffian, and so is Spock. I highly fear a Sequel where they both continue spanking god-mighty Ferenghi from the future or inseminate dangerous Tribble females in this sappy alternate universe.I would have given more stars if there would have been at least a scene where Spock's artificial teeth set is shown in a glass together with the mysterious red matter floating around, as Nero's ultimate revenge to teach Spock why he really failed.Every other star above 4 I added regretfully through the years because of overlooking most absurdities mentioned above and thinking 'c'mon, don't be so hard, be thankful instead, it's a Trek-Movie at least'.",7,2,7,15 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Robocop without blood spill
","I don't like comparing very much, every movie is a new world for itself, but in this case I have to mourn this sequel. Of course it is a decent piece of Hollywood popcorn cinema, this kind of pictures always succeeds in the western world, like Bollywood movies in India. You have to leave your brain outside (if you own one) and you know what you have to expect. I for myself tend to celebrate this expend as a therapy to escape the real and dull world, and my children have phun. But Iron Man 2 left me quite disappointed. If I wouldn't have known the first part, that maybe wouldn't be the case. But now I missed <ul><li>a good and fresh new story instead of an hours-filling struggle to entertain me with the obvious </li></ul><ul><li>tension and dramatic highlights instead of those simplistic chases and fights</li></ul><ul><li>more dimensional characters and especially charm like in Iron Man 1 </li></ul><ul><li>actors and a director who really enjoy their work </li></ul><ul><li>the begun love story at a somewhere noticeable level continued</li></ul>Iron man 2 isn't much more than a rehash of its predecessor. Number one mostly successfully tried to keep me interested, say, with Tony Stark's imprisonment, with the love story (remember the scene where she have to fix the power unit in his chest ? - nothing like this in here !), the machination of his father's friend, and so on.The present sequel is far too clean and free of any obstacles for the Hero's final victory. It has no highlights except the presence of Mickey Rourke, whom I wish that his career now may have taken a new start. To say that the most impressing things in this movie were his old-style glasses and his big fingernails, may sound weird but that's it. Although I found especially his character not as delightful as he could be with a better script or a better direction.But always looking for the box office eradicates seemingly every creativity, since the rules say 'take no risk, but always the money'.The most ridiculous appearance was for me one-eyed Nick Fury's with his Avenger organization. That Avenger thing may be a part of America's comic culture, but it did nothing good for the story except giving an explanation why a former model (Scarlett Johanssen, beautiful and seductive, outperforming bland Gwyneth Paltrow at every scene they commonly have) should work at a department of Stark Industries. Samuel L. Jackson's and Scarlett Johanssens's talents are both wasted at most of their screen time, which is, in his case, fortunately, not for long.My conclusion is that this is a ready-to-wear movie not made by caring authors or artists but concept creators and financial analysts. There is no dirt, no danger. There is no chemistry between anybody, because there is no scene for it. There are no highlights, no risky scenes, no surprises. Nothing to remember, but the box office performance.",5,1,4,5 September 2010
Aliens," Almost an Army feature Film
","When I saw 'Aliens' more than 20 years ago, I didn't like it because of the military presence. I didn't like the Army, and I didn't believe that in the future such an armed rabble would be used to make something like 'first contact' with possibly precious xenomorphs. I disliked the complete crew, and my understanding was that the movie was sympathizing with them. Maybe I was wrong and it is all humor, and the Army is satirized. I'm not that intelligent, you should know.At first, I liked the introduction. Ripley aged only a few years during her 57 years hibernation, I found that time line a good Idea. Unfortunately, script writer's imagination could not transport the effects of this half century, on the contrary, technology, clothing and behavior mention more a regression than improvement.First laugh (in a bad sense) was, when Ripley was accused for destroying her worthy freighter Nostromo. Of course was the Nostromo worthy like a supertanker, but isn't a ship of this size and the cargo insured ? They had 57 years to get the insurance sum, so what's up with this future ?Later it comes out that the contact to the colony on the Alien egg planet is lost. Surely they had no opportunity to report what happened. A colony around an expensive atmospheric modifier doesn't give any reports about what's happening or any dangerous incidents.Someone in the movie says that it lasts decades to transform a planets atmosphere. Meanwhile the colonists, which are obviously researching the surface, didn't find any trace from the huge stranded spaceship, which sent the distress call that led the Nostromo to her final destruction in the first movie. OK, colonists are dumb or simply blind.Also dumb are the marines. Confrontated with Ripley who is the last survivor of a deadly alien encounter, they are not willing to hear anything what she says. I as their officer would have made them shut up immediately, because every information could be important for surviving. If soldiers of the future are such idiots as shown here, there would be no need for powerful aliens to destroy humanity.I can't imagine that any officer wouldn't send artificial drones ahead to research the situation. I can't imagine, too, that anyone would send such a small and dumb team to investigate the possible alien-caused death of 70 families. The mission in the later 'AVP' movie is much better prepared with scientists from all over the world. OK, here we have Bishop, but he doesn't seem to be very helpful, and he has no rights to make decisions. A few more Bishop's, especially for fighting purposes, would have made the mission more serious.The greatest disappointment in 'Aliens' is the disappearance of the alien's being nearly indelible. When the alien in the first movie is not even destroyed by the escape pod's jet engines (it's adapting to the heat, i suppose), it is here like destroying cockroaches. You can squish them with your car, you can shoot them, or simple burn with a standard flamethrower. A bunch of well-armed soldiers with a little bit more brain than the people shown in this movie would be able to eliminate a complete alien population. For what purpose would the military use such a weak race defies me. Sure, you can infest a planet of your enemies, you don't have to care about them any more. But then your own world would be also in danger because of the revenge of the survivors. And the infested world is useless. However, I know, military is always interested in new and dangerous toys.The mystery of the aliens and the other race - the big stoned guy - from the first movie is completely gone. It is simply a bug slashing feature film. When they find out that the colonists have already caught two living facehuggers, Burke's mission would be done. Instead, they are going ahead for certain death. There are many errors in the script. One is, how did Burke mange to put the facehugger to Ripley's sleeping place. Did he carry the containment tank, or did he carry the alien under his arm ? Then, there is the first confrontation between the Queen and Ripley. Ripley fills the eggs with loads of ammo and explosives, Mother's bearing channel is slashed, and there is no acid burning Ripley and Newt. And in the final fight, the ladder where Ripley is hanging is always within reach for the queen's second hand. Instead, she is angrily swinging around with her free arm. And I thought (almost), come on, big lady, take the ladder, take it, please, and then eat Ripley for killing your babies. Poor mother, so big, so dumb.The positive side is, that - blinding out the mediocre script, visuals, dialogs and actors - the movie is actually thrilling. It's more thrilling than most of the movie's of it's time, and the idea to fight the queen with the cargo loading exoskeleton is really funny. I personally understood Ripleys decision to go for Newt into the burning reactor, but I also understood that the figure of Newt is only a vehicle to fill plot holes.I gave 5 stars even if it deserves six for the thrill of the hunt.",6,4,9,18 April 2009
Alien vs. Predator," This movie got a raw deal
","Maybe I'm the last one who passes a comment here about this movie. So I give it the good grade it deserves (i.m.o.). Seeing a movie is a very personal thing. You have some knowings, some anticipations, you have a background. I didn't anticipate anything special than an usual American action movie. I know the Alien movies, the Predator movies, the AvP2 game and all the Alien, Predator and AvP Comics. So I SHOULD have been disappointed by the AvP movie, like many others here and around. But I was highly impressed. The atmosphere, the speed, the characters, even the plot, I was caught by it through the whole time the movie lasted. Note that I have some of the following most liked films in my background: Eraser Head, Brazil, La belle captive, Dark Star, Once upon a time in the West, Dr. Strangelove, Nosferatu (with K.Kinski), THX1138, Irezumi, Le clan des Siciliens, Needful Things, and so on. Now AvP is one of them. I liked the (simple, yes) storyline, I liked the nice girl, I liked the game, the Predators and the Aliens and their fights, and the fast and efficient cuts. I liked poor Lance, and I liked the (triple) open end, where the Predalien hatches, the Queen sinks in the cold water (which should not kill her), and where the future of the heroine is unknown in an environment of usually minus 50° Celsius. I liked the Idea of a situation where most of the humans are powerless, and the strongest of them is a compact sexy and brave woman. She is the only one who knows where to go. She is the only one who gets respect from the Predator. Maybe this is why so many of other (male ?) opinions here are nearly hateful against AvP; most of the men - when not all - are shown weak, a scarfaced mercenary is even the most fearful. This is against American habit. The key scene is when she gives the final shot to her captured and Chestbuster bearing teammate, and the Predator is impressed. The Predators are someway careless, they believe too much in their strength than in teamwork strategy, and so they are overpowered in combat and the last of them is infested by a facehugger. The Aliens are also sympathetic for their strength and fighting skills - remember that they were born just a few hours ago.Also the Queen and her wrath are amazingly shown. She has some sort of intelligence, so she calls her breed to release her with use of their acid blood. Who knows, for how long she is caught in the pyramid to serve Predator's game every 100 years. I enjoyed every minute of the movie, and also I enjoyed reading later about mistakes and logical errors. AvP is illogical, and Aliens and Predators, too. The first Alien movie was outstanding, not merely because it was such an intelligent thing, or even deeply interpretable or whatsoever, but because it was an atmospherically horror premiere. And the first Predator movie - hmhmhm; greetings to Gov. A. from Graz. Fortunately, AvP went its own way in the middle of the two main brands. The director leads us into a sporty hell where man is only needed as a host. It is easy for the Predators to activate man's greed, they know that someone will come freely and will feed the Aliens spawn (less freely). The Aliens are (if we go philosophical) the real victims, because they are only born for the thrill of the hunt. There is no need to switch off the brain for AvP. This is a must, for example, if you see Ghost Rider. AvP is a fine B-Production with A-look-and-feel in some sequences. In my conclusion, AvP is one of the most intriguing movies of the last years, often underestimated and victimized. Whensoever Terminator 1 is now at a cult-like level, there is no reason for me why not AvP also. 8 stars only because of the many errors, otherwise it would have 9 stars (10 is only for Brazil and the others). And: Im definitively no employee of the producer's company.",8,2,3,13 December 2007
District 9," Extraordinary Surprise
","I have to say in advance, that I didn't hear anything about this movie, there was no hype for me, I'm simply interested in good SciFi. D9 is in a way a SciFi Slumdog Millionaire; if you allow yourself being caught you are totally in. Some months ago I hated Cloverfield for making my head aching and boring me. I hated Star Trek for disappointing me with being more childish (and thereby being so seriously) than Star Wars. Now I love District 9 for surprising me with a good idea and a subversive view. SciFi is rare, because it's expensive. Good SciFi is one of the rarest things, because the massive amounts of money spent must flow back to the investors with profit, and they think, that only mainstream and infantile movies work in that way. D9 was cheap, compared to other top movies of the genre, and so the producer had not many risks to bear.So the author had the opportunity to use his plot to show us some of the uglier sides of us, by unmasking common accepted behavior, preoccupation, condemnation and greed as essential (and damnable) parts of our daily life.There is one key scene (for me) where Witus, the main character, describes how Alien fetuses are destroyed resp. burned with flamethrowers and make noises like popcorn during this process. It is obvious that those people don't think that the 'Shrimps' are worthy beings, despite - or because - they live with them since more than two decades. In this moment you see how easy it is to treat somebody as sub-human. Another key scene is at the beginning, when they learn that the Aliens are poor and weak (and dumb) beings. After the first amazement there is no benefit from the encounter, no wonders are coming from them, they simply have to be fed. They are a burden and primarily useless. So there is no need to try to understand and treat them in an appropriate way ?But i don't want to over-interpret this movie. It's definitively not only for 'intelligent people', but for people who are bored from predictable US mainstream SciFi. And yes, D9 is political incorrect. The Nigerians are shown like real Idiots who actually think, eating Aliens could make them mighty and powerful, even after this didn't work during the past 20 years. They are villains, cat food dealers like drug dealers, there is no positive aspect in their appearance. It's a cliché, and maybe the author worked up some personal reluctance. But the story needed a color equation for the badness of all those white guys.I admit that the part which is critical of society is not the real main part of the movie. The movie wants to suggest that, but the main part is the action shootout in the MNU center and the slums. Although this is a bit too long and too tension (= box office) oriented, it intensifies the impression of the rest of the movie.I for myself rated back from 10 to 9 because of the 90% happy end, according to my mom who always said 'good movie, bad ending' ;-)",9,27,46,19 September 2009
Kick-Ass," A funny lie
","In the first hour or so Kick-Ass was very funny for me. I realized that it is based on a Comic Book I read one year ago until Issue 4. And until issue 4 I liked the Comic Book, so I liked the movie until then and a little further.The Idea to present a complete loser as a super hero, and how he would survive in the real world is very interesting, and it is also funny. Funny as a comedy about USA, about hypes and those virtual places of self-expression, about youth, violence, fighting, crime....The jokes are not that intelligent, I admit it. But they are surprisingly ruthless, and sarcastic, so everyone can figure out that this is not a Hollywood production.But it is obviously a major production, and it has to earn its major money. Like Mark Millars comic, which was, also obviously, made to make major money. The Comic is, maybe, a little deeper than the movie. Until the end of issue 4, where Hit-Girl appears with her katana, it is an interesting comic about a loser in a costume, who tries to escape his fate as a loser and also, tries to do something better, which is really honorable. After that, it's about earning money for the publishers and the Author. The Hit Girl Character is created for that reason (only). Same with the movie. And with this superhuman figure appearance every realism disappears and with realism also humor.The movie evolves then from a lighthearted sarcastic comedy to a simple Hollywood brainless action flick, still funny for many (male) teens or adults (including myself !) because of the exaggerated action and situations. But it looses its dark humor, and that's a real tragedy.A real shame is the loss of big Daddies confession in the Comic Book, he is only a loser who wanted to give his daughter and himself a more meaningful life, so he stole her from her mother and searched for a Villain he can battle against. No former Police Officer who was tricked by the big bad guy, no death of Hit Girl's mother. So the movie continues to lose any of those small amounts of intelligence and directly leads into mainstream action where it didn't necessarily have to - remember that it's self declared as innovative and fresh.Because finishing the villain with the premise of having no real cause - personal revenge, which is not agreeable but understandable - but only for being someone or having a special life, or simply for a lie, that would you make think about how much it is worth to begin a war against someone you haven't anything to do with; that's what Miller wanted to express with his little twist in his story. In that context the pride of Big Daddy about Hit Girl gets a new meaning, also.As long as Kick-Ass is a nerd, a loser, an idiot, he is a real superhero. We can identify ourselves with him when we imagine how we would act wearing his costume, except we are someone like Bas Rutten. But Big Daddy is a lunatic who abuses his daughter as a child-soldier for his perverted ideas, and when this is carried out in the Book, those funny killings and shootouts get some bitter after-taste. This is a major aspect, peculated in the movie for commercial reasons. Nevertheless, in real life people do not suffer because of their mass murderers if they don't get caught by law.However, a remarkable scene is when Hit-Girl rescues Kick-Ass in the warehouse. She uses night vision, and where the Comic Book gives this scene only a few pictures of killing two or three bad guys, the movie creates an impressive ego-shooter-like battle lasting several minutes. I'm not sure what the creators wanted to say with this, but it was funny and disturbing the same time. I think it's the first time that a gaming sight was brought into life in a movie, except in 'Gamer', where the realization of the combats cannot measure up to this. I recommend gaming fans to watch the movie only for this scene.Overall, the acting is a bit wooden, and Kick Ass himself is not believable as loser, because he is simply too good looking. N.C. as Big Daddy is not on top of N.C. intensity, maybe because he's behind a mustache or a mask. The most convincing acting is - now I may disagree with all of you - by Mark Strong as Frank. Surely Chloe Moretz is fascinating, but I know that this is also a big matter of cut, camera and timing, so if she steals the show, its what the director intended.At last I must disagree that this movie is in any way comparable with Spy Kids. This would be like comparing Fritz the Cat to Aristocats. And any comparison with Kill Bill is a real insult for Kill Bill. If you want to compare Prison Break with Down By Law, just do so...Edit: After watching Kick-Ass again I rated it from 6 to 8 because of perfect choreography and - despite the changes mentioned above - making an unforgettable experience from a more or less unimpressive source.",9,6,14,13 May 2010
Million Dollar Baby," Two unsatisfying movies put together
","When I watched the Rocky-Movies as a youngster, I didn't like them. So I was hopeful, as I like boxing a bit, that this movie could entertain me more, although it caught some Oscars. And it did, for the first time being. Until the big and sad drama begins, there is everything a good boxing film needs, showing the hunger which is necessary for a winner, likable characters, some problems with the family and so on. More interesting for me was that the story turned out to be about the Trainer, not so much about boxing or boxers. Trainer Frankie, played by Eastwood, is shown as a man with heart, the typical American cliché figure that has a rough skin and a soft core, both developed in his former life. Many other clichés are used to lead us into the right mood. The figure of the boy called Danger is somewhere artificial and serves only as an addendum to the picture of the family at Frankie's gym. Frankie's own family is not present, so he has adopted some losers as his family, as he is kind of a looser himself. The winners always leave him, because he is too worrying, he hates risks. His best friend, played superbly by Mr. Freeman (when isn't he superb only by presence ?) with wonderful calmness, behaves like Frankie's wife. Danger is the witless nephew or son, who is tolerated because he is harmless and poor. But when the good son leaves, there is an occasion for Frankie to acquire a surrogate for his lost daughter, a dream for every father, because she willingly bounds her to his judgment without any questions, and looks up to him from the first moment, like every daddy wants to be adored. And she is also 'a good girl', she isn't problematic like any other daughter you have to rise.In some cases this part of the movie is in a way superficial, I wondered if Frankie's top fighter wouldn't have left him, would he have agreed to train Maggie ? And wouldn't have even an about 18 years working waitress have some friends or background ? Never mind, boxing girls must be kinda weird, so the audience is forced to enter Frankie's Island, a small universe among the rumbling environment, where the rules of existence and social live are completely blanked out. The rest of the world is hidden, only recalled when needed for the script. Not to mention the unbelievable speed of Maggie's evolution from a nerd to a top boxer. This could have been a wonderful fairy tale about a synthetic family and wouldn't have needed any sad hospital drama, after we had romance, humor, and action. I, as an European, would have seen much rather any other conflicts or problems after the inevitable twist. Maybe the twist isn't really inevitable, after leading the girl to the title there are many possibilities to offer an interesting proceeding - even if you hope for an Oscar. You can even let her lose the fight, and not only because of the unfairness of that 'Former bitch from Germany'. I wonder for which reason this in many ways discriminatory denomination was used.However, after the twist of fate is set, the movie (intentionally ?) retrieves from every potential it had before, and leads directly to a stereotype tragedy. When I and others here talk about clichés, up to this point they were used in an (for me) acceptable number, but from now until the end, the movie itself is a stereotype. For me it was extremely annoying that they relativize the suffering of a human, lying in the hospital bed completely paralyzed, with the fact that 'she had her chance'. This is a rape of the reality, we all live at the moment and even if one had his/her chance, it would not be important for the current suffering. This semi-philosophical crap is something I've seen too often in US movies, it 's simply a lie to forget about life's inequity. I think its a lack of imagination not even to try to give such victims a reason to live. I gave 9 Points for the first three quarters, the actors and the mood, minus 4 Points for the rest, plus 1 point for the courage to kill a working movie long before the closing credits. And: I loved the Swank girl.",7,0,6,12 April 2009
Ip Man," An Unusually Gentle Martial Arts Movie
","This is a rare genre movie with seemingly realistic fighting scenes with elegant, efficient short moves, and no inhuman acrobatics. From the very first moment you realize that this movie doesn't center on it's genre, it has many fighting scenes, but it's not focused on the sensation. And that is a fresh approach that makes it memorable.Additionally you have believable, sympathetic actors, not completely one-dimensional enemies (ok, one and a half dimensional), a bit of humor, simple but effective dialogs, heartwarming atmosphere and a perfect cinematography. Donnie Yen plays this man very calm and serious, with a good little sense for Chinese humor.The movie is made with a caring sympathy for people and the Chinese way of life, it takes its time to show us a society on a village level with no big conflicts before the Japanese invasion. That is the reason why I can't give it a higher rating, even if I would - Yip Man's life and the life of his family and his neighbors is a bit too happy, not complete believable, it seems to be washed or beautified, so that western watchers can enjoy it. I could even suspect that it's fantasy, If I want - which I don't, because it's a fictional movie on a Hollywood level, not a biopic, although Yip Man is a historical person. At least I don't forget that before the Japanese occupation China was at civil war (from 1930 on), so life there shouldn't have been that easy.Yip Man himself seems to be rich, he owns a big house and doesn't need to work. For such a man, he is surprisingly unpretentious, which may come from the influence of the philosophy-driven martial arts he loves.There are some clichÃ©s which can't be avoided looking back in history of the Japanese/Chinese war, but at least to show the Japanese General as a man of honor (in opposite to his lower staff) seems to be halfway realistic (If a real general would be mounted as governor of such a small town is another question).Anyone who sees a propagandistic approach should read some statistics and proved stories about the time of Japanese occupation, before judging. I think, the way the Japanese are depicted here is rather softened. Japanese saw Chinese as lower people, not as humans on the same level. They were in some ways not far from German ideas of that time.A little setback is the ending, which comes too fast and unexpected, after the movie took so much time (in a good way) to invite us into its world. I would have been also interested to learn about the General's fate. At least 10 or 15 minutes watching Yip Man recovering, maybe watching the General committing Sepukku, would not have harmed the chance for a sequel, and everyone would have seen the credits more satisfied, and would be more sure that this is the best Martial Art's movies ever.Still, one of the best - when not the best - movies in this genre I've ever seen.",8,0,1,17 June 2011
Rio," A Beautiful Lie
","First, Rio is nicely made with a scene I will never forget - the huge amounts of slime slobbering dog will always stay in my heart beneath another children's movie where it is all about funny vomiting. The slimy dog caused my body to ripple a few times, while the movie did not loose focus on slobbering for a small eternity. It's nice for me to see somebody with equal taste. There are nice locations, nice colors, nice enemies, nice heroes, and even nice songs, which was a genuine surprise for me, as I usually hate musicals since my earliest youth. I don't need to recommend this movie to anyone, because it seems that already the whole world has watched it. And most people loved it, because it's lighthearted and funny.And here we come to the amount of light hearts, which I do equal with selfishness (of the seller). When I watched Rio with my children, my son (18yrs) mentioned the high criminal rate in Rio, one of the highest in the world, and I whispered back that he will not see anything of this in the movie except in a polished way that doesn't exist in reality.I have the archaic theory that watching a movie on the big screen should include a few educational aspects. That may correspond with amounts of money I spend at the cinema (here about 90 incl. junk food for two adults and three children).In this case lessons one could learn are, that people will not look behind nice illusions even if they know the truth first-hand, as it should be with the Brazil-originated director. And that the nicer and more excited a picture is shown, the more it should be questioned.In the town Rio of today's days there are private militia organizations, formed by members of the police, fighting against criminal syndicates consisting of up to 5000 heavy-armed men. While the police itself is completely absent in large areas of the town, the militia constantly pushes the criminals out of their range of influence, but demands also a fee from the citizens. The crime detection rate is near 1%. I know that the Brazilians have an admirable sense for living - or designing - an exciting life(style), the carnival, the Copacabana... But also most Brazilians are poor, uninsured, live between junk, have no future...The mega-cities like Rio may look modern to us, but living in the Favelas is not an easy thing. 2008 in Rio, until June, about 4000 persons died alone by gunshots.I understand it's not easy to make a pure fun movie for children with all the bad things that exist around. But who would make a movie about the wonderful live in Japan nearby Fukushima without even mentioning its dangers ? - I would say, only a cynical director on a money hunt could do that.Yes, I know, when it comes to Disney animations or children movies in general, my concerns should be all the same. Watching an idyllic world always needs some parental correctional afterwords. Couldn't i let fun simply be fun ? - No, not when it's hiding something dirty.",5,3,10,25 April 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Wickie 2010 at highest possible level
","Having viewed this movie a few months ago, when a long and cold and moist winter made my country shuddering, I now remembered that I wanted to write a review.At first I have to say that I personally hate(d) 3D because I'm one of those Kings between the blind, so Stereo-3D is complete useless for me, except that it's more expensive. I always refused to view one of those new 3D movies with my children, because I was afraid to lose viewing quality..With 'How to Train Your Dragon' I wasn't able to withstand the strong desires of both my daughters, and agreed to wear those idiotic carnival glasses during the movie.Thanks to modern techniques, my fears were unsubstantiated and I was able to enjoy the movie's visual quality with my only one working eye, like it would be a normal 2-D animated film.At first I realized that this was going be a very modern 'Wickie re-imaged'. If you don't know the animated series from the 70's, Wickie is a young Viking who is small but imaginative and inventive, with long blonde hair like a girl, and not a fighter like his rather dumb but strong father Halvar (The Great). After his father realizes that he has a very special son, not the usual brute dude to be proud of, but someone who saves him and his crew permanently from dangerous situations, he accepts him instantly. Any similarities there ? Yes you see, they stole heavily.But in this movie the young hero has much more to do to convince his father being a son to be proud of. He is much more a loser, like the young son in 'Cloudy...' where is a big language barrier between father and son which hinders them from communicating in the right way. Interesting that in many of those movies today where the son is such a soft and weak and girlish loser in the first place, there is an absence of the mother (Wanted, Kick-Ass), which may come from divorced authors who always dream about having their children. However, 'Wickie' has a mother in the series, the usual Viking sized Mum, who serves at home for the good of the family (but doesn't hesitate to confront her mighty husband when he's doing wrong in her view).But for the audiences of today, simple adventures seemingly ain't enough to make a movie interesting for them. There have to be some special dangerous but likable and fascinating thing, and what's more kind of that than dragons ? Now, the first appearance of the night-shadow dragon in this movie was very disappointing for me. It looks like Stitch whose look and feel I always hated.Nevertheless I felt from the first minute viewing an extraordinary production, because of the sympathetic and differentiated characterizations of all persons. I wondered how 'acting' Hiccup was animated, I enjoyed the obviously teen targeted funny dialogs, and I got dizzy from the great flight scenes even in my personal 2-D.Surely the story is predictable and the characters are cliché, but I can appreciate good and moody cliché, if it's not bothersome and if it has some fresh updates. After the movie is so much filled with things children love, with adventure, drama (yes they do love drama), about growing up, first love, finding your abilities, understanding together, it won't get along without some stereotypes, otherwise it wouldn't be so easy to understand (which is mandatory for a children's film).After leaving the cinema my two daughters and I were completely happy and heart-warmed, so this was a very good investment, and I will also get over the additional costs for the DVD, because this is a movie you can enjoy more than once.",9,1,2,27 May 2010
Joker," Poor, Poor Jokey
","I must say, I did expect at least some deepness from this movie, since it was so high praised by the community.
In the end, it turns out that poor Jokey was an abused child, and anything that he needed, to rise as Joker, was just a gun that a colleague gave him.
So the introduction to Joker, him being the archetype of a criminal kingpin (in a comic fiction, that has to be added) is a very sad and predictable story about a mentally crippled, poor man in his 40s, who lives with his old and ill mom (gosh, where did I see this setting the last time, it's like writers cannot think of a different one with their villains) during bad times.
Once he aquires said gun, he is beaten by some dicks in the subway and shoots them, which leads to the release of his brutal side.
I did not need to watch one trailer to feel most of the movie's story coming, even the fantasy girlfriend was easy to tell.
I can only slightly imagine, how so many people got fascinated by a story that is only a flat cliche on nearly every level, but there are so many hints whispering 'i am good, believe me', and I assume, people just couldn't resist.
But it maybe, too, be a picture that especially works for and in the U.S. I live in Europe, where the mentally ill and traumatized ones are integrated into society wherever possible, with the same rights like everyone, or even more. Programs to support them are rarely cancelled and handicapped peopleof all kinds get protected employments.
So I could not really connect with the premises, but hey, it's Gotham, isn't it ? A town that is supposed to be a fictional NewChicagomerica, where everything can happen. Therefore the most dumb storyline one can imagine can happen also, and it does.
So for me 'Joker' is only 4 stars, with 4 of them going to J. Phoenix, who did a great Job in saving a development story single-handedly, that seems to be written by substage pupils.",4,3,10,26 December 2019
X-Men: First Class," Exerted but Failed
","Honestly I can't follow the high ratings of this movie. That maybe a generation's problem, as I'm in the mid of my 40s and have other demands of a great movie. However, although I'm an old sack, I liked the last four X-Men movies (including Wolverine) more than First Class.And this is mostly because I missed most of the actors, first of all Ian McKellen (Magneto), Patrick Stewart (Xavier), and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). Those three (especially McKellen) carried the X-Men movies with serious acting skills and charisma. It's a bit like the latest Star Trek. The Universe is the same, but the faces are gone, and despite there are new, well-looking faces and good actors, you don't feel the old mood.Also, there is something certainly missing with those prequels. While cgi and visual techniques are growing, the basic feeling of the former sequels is not present.First Class tries really hard to drag you in, but with me (and some others I know) it failed. Mystique was ever a character who had not enough screen time, and here she has, is sexy and beautiful and interesting, but keeps being not more than a nice color blob, like one of James Bond's Babes. Magneto's development is shown in detail, but it didn't convince me. Xavier's development is also shown, and we learn how he worked together with magneto, but with all that action and ba-boom this relationship between the two most powerful mutants keeps being - i don't find another word - uninteresting. The worst part is Emma Frost's, her character is paper-thin like Mystique in X3. The movie may fulfill all the expectations younger viewers may have, but for me it kept being hollow and a CGI action flick between many, despite its great efforts to convince me of the opposite. After the final battle, however intriguing, I wasn't that intrigued.",6,0,4,17 July 2011
Annihilation," It Could Have Been a Masterwork
","Based on the experience watching it, I would have given 'Annihilation' 8 or even 9 stars. But based on the many things where this movie fails, I can't give more than six stars.
Where it shines:
-Fantastic music and scenery
-Great Digital effects
-Atmosphere, sense of wonder
-Full of Tension, good pacing
Where it fails:
-Lacks any plausibility
-Making no sense at all
-Completely missing character development
For the positive attributes I feel no need to explain them, for the negative the following has to be said.
If you want to make a film that lasts in the audience's memory, you have to minimize the amount of 'suspension of disbelief'. If a movie is entirely constructed to fit the needs of the production and not the needs of the audience, something went wrong.
'Annihilition', while utterly beautiful, haunting and fascinating, during its best moments, suffers of very unbelievable premises. Remember, there is an event that is unpreceded in history, and even today it would not be possible to hide a growing anomaly that huge for a year. Further, the idea to send a platoon of armed women into the anomaly, without the possibility to report their sightings directly, is completely ridiculous. Even, or just because there were other teams before, which did not return. Who wants to waste people ? You could keep sending teams, until the alien lifeform consumes a continent, with no success.
There should be countless other, much smarter options to get a picture of the situation, but of course we have to follow the dumbest of them for only dramatical purposes.
However, on the inside, there are some completely unnecessary violent encounters, which are only there to create fear and a kind of tense that should not have found its way into this movie. I did not take 'Annihilation' for an 'Alien' or 'Predator' horror-action thriller, but more in a 'Solaris' or 'Stalker' direction. 
The idea of an experimenting nature, without any other primary purpose or a mindset like ours, is a great one, and executed properly, but only in fragments and in the end. I wonder if the movie wouldn't have benefitted from another thirty minutes of exploration and transformation. 
So, while everything could have been great with a bit more overthinking, 'Annihiliation' only partially succeeds in being impressing. On top of it, it gives us only a bit of a definition for the main charcter, the others are only shadowly persons.
In the end, you may feel tricked, as you think you have seen a good movie, that is in truth not such a one.",6,0,1,12 August 2018
