The Blair Witch Project," Don´t believe the hype! LAME!!!
","I saw Blair Witch Project and I have to say, that it doesn´t scare me at all! Totally lame! 3 Students go to the woods and act like babies, oooh, how scary! 1. Their behavior in the woods: Totally foolish. Every thinking individual would try to relaxe the situation. But our 3 'heroes' just run around and get psycho. 2. Nothing happens! What would you think, if you are in such a situation? I would think, that some friends or someone else is tricking me! The next step is that those guys have the whole day to prepare for the night. What would you do? If I fear to be killed or whatever, I would build some weapons, motion-detectors, etc. (You can do that, the only thing you nead is a knife and some creativity!) 3. The ending. Sorry folks, but it´s too easy to let everything unsaid! I f***in´ hate it! My theory: The guys only wanted to to kill the girl. It´s their trick! Only americans can believe this to be a true report!!!",1,2,4,19 June 2000
Final Destination," Nice one!
","I saw this movie just before it comes to the german cinemas ;) and i must say, that it was really fun to watch it! The movie differs to others like Scream by the intelligent story. I didn´t know anything about the film and i guess, that it´s more fun that way! In good tradition to other 'who will survive and what will be left of them'-movies ... Enjoy MTSNOOP 8/10",8,1,1,19 June 2000
