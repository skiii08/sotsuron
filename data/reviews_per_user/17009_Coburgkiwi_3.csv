Hereditary," Genuinely creepy but ultimately disappointing
","I'll be honest - I saw the trailer and was blown away. I jumped on a tram as soon as I could to head in to the city to watch what I thought would be a film setting a new benchmark in horror. Well some of the reviews described it in the same league as The Exorcist. And the majority of the movie reminded me of 'the turn of the screw' ie as the tension tightened and tightened. But while most of the movie was genuinely creepy, I was so disappointed w the last half hour. It turned from creepy to verging on ridiculous. As another reviewer has written, I suspect that the writers ran out of ideas and didn't know how to wrap it all up. While I applaud the creators of this movie for having some very creepy moments .......and not resorting to the cliched scarey 'moves' that ended up ruining the 'Paranormal Activity' series ie knives falling from the air (yawn), cupboards opening with a bang all at the same time (yawn) or other horror movies that have a doll or dolls in a rocking chair (yawn) or a toy rolls into an emptyroom only to be pushed back out by some unseen force (yawn) - yes good on them for not resorting to a number of tired cliches. But the last half hour and ending were SO disappointing. I guess I will take the tram back home and wait for another movie to redefine the horror genre.",4,19,48,8 June 2018
Wind River," Excellent acting
",So much better than Sicario. Renner plays a grieving father with much subtlety and the overall cast are outstanding. Particularly Gil Birmingham. A whodunit that unfolds in an understated way but is eventually gripping and moving. And has a sobering message re the absence of stats for missing Native American women. I highly recommend.,8,10,19,11 August 2017
A Quiet Place," Often in horror films characters make stupid mistakes
","The acting was great, I will say that. But I found the pace incredibly slow between 'monster appearances'. I watched this on dvd so could fast forward when i wanted. To be honest I was glad I wasn't in the theatre during the slow bits. I didn't mind the look of the monsters - but they did seem very similar to that creature that ate the cat in Stranger Things. Lots of plot-holes as others have pointed out - where did the electricity come from?; why didn't they live by the waterfall?; where was the Army?; why did they have a baby?; how did the monsters get around without hitting trees? etc etc. But often in horror films, usually of the slasher variety, the main characters make lots of silly mistakes and end up in dire situations. I guess my gripe with this movie is that some of the decisions/lack of decisions were just too implausible for the type of movie that this was trying to be. Like it wasn't a spoof like Zombie Beavers. And characters in 'Wolf Creek' make dumb decisions but parts of that movie were scary. I just found the implausible parts to be a bit insulting to my intelligence. Like if they could hook up all those lights and everything, why couldn't they set up a better living situation? Why were the kids so afraid of getting back to the house, ie from the corn silo? Like as long as they were quiet, they had nothing to fear. Why weren't there more sound diversions? Why didn't they shoot the rifle and the creature would run in the direction of the shot, away from them. I could go on and on.But not all bad - good acting, specially the young girl. Just give me a decent story to sink my teeth in to!",1,2,3,11 October 2018
