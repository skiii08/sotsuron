Miracle," couple of key words
","Miracle (2004)..... Here are a couple of key words for this movie. - Great - immense - Intence - Powerful - fascinating - Passionat - emotional and much much more. I started this movie thinking, this is gonna be one of those tiresome, true story. after movies like 'Radio' & 'Remember the titans', i thought what could add u to that. What could be an improvement Let me tell you, i turned the movie on and i could not get my self to even pause it, let alone stop it. I watched it in one run and forgot i had to go to the toilet.(don't worry, the couch is still clean;-)). and i know, i've been told i'm way to enthusiastic about some movies. But believe me, This is one to get ENTHUSIASTIC about. Without any doubt, i'm rating this movie '10'. To people who haven't seen it, 'WATCH THIS ONE' To DVD collectors like myself; 'ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION' And naturally a standing ovation to Herb Brooks.",10,1,1,25 August 2005
The Fifth Element," this movie goes straight into my top 5
","this movie is one of the great ones. Easy to watch, but still with a big story behind it. lots of humor, actions, different species. and one of the funniest things i've seen, 'the Chinese fly by restaurant guy in his old flying boat'. Chris Tucker with his freaky voice, the heavenly Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman plays 'Zorg' great and Bruce Willis...what can i say about him...i'm a big fan ! The movie is far from perfection, that's why i gave it one point deduction. but like i said 'it's went straight into my personal top 5.My Final Conclusion: nothing more to say, just go and watch it, and hopefully you'll become just a big a fan as me.",9,11,19,3 April 2005
Blade," one word....'awesome'
","This is it, a 20th century vampire movie.Voted a 6.8 ???? come on people, this movie is definitely worth more than that. Shooting, swords, martial arts, Amazing special effects, hardcore action, what more could anyone want i ask myself. i said it many time before and probably say it many times more. 'everybody knows what they want out of a good movie, if vampire movies isn't your thing, don't expect to like it' so don't give a great movie a bad rep because you made a bad personal choice. even though i'd never expected for Wesley Snipes to go for a role like this, i couldn't think of anyone else better for the job. and Stephen Dorff, you can see a lot of progress from when he started out till blade & the work after that.",10,0,2,4 September 2005
