Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Better than pts 2 and 3, not as good as pt. 1
","This fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean sees the series improve again, after two increasingly hard to follow sequels.The story opts to omit the characters of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to the movie's benefit: while other side-kicks for Jack Sparrow are introduced (notably Pen√©lope Cruz and Sam Claflin), they don't tear the story apart as Keira and Orlando did. We get a much more understandable plot here, with clear motivations and goals for the protagonists.While I like this pt. 4 better than pts 2 and 3, I think it's still not as good as pt. 1; for there are less surprising twists, less endearing details, e.g., in the battle or pursuit scenes. Those feel more like routine here, the writers and director probably straining to get back to safer grounds after the bizarre excesses of pt. 3 (does anyone remember that battle/pursuit scene with the giant rotating wheel rolling away in the jungle?).Overall, a good and well-crafted if in parts a bit tired fourth part of the franchise.",7,1,1,6 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," True to the book
","I felt like this first part of the HP finale bears the same strengths and weaknesses as the book: A furious start (Harry's party leaving his home and being attacked by death eaters) followed by a quite drawn-out and repetitive stretch (Harry and his core crew err around and look for horcruxes aka magic tokens).As in the book, the emotional conflicts between Harry, Hermione and especially Ron are not very deep or convincing. The obvious parallels with the Lord of the Rings (Ron and his locket vs. Frodo and the ring) are embarrassing, to say the least.Still, in terms of mood and visual style the movie comes astonishingly close to what I had in mind when I read the book. Overall, good and faithful adaptation but no cigar.",7,0,2,6 June 2011
