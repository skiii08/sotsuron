The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great camera work; so-so story.
","I thought it was a beautifully filmed story. And thats about it. Matt Damon looked the part. Will Smith gave a good performance, although his character wasn't very 'mysterious'. Bruce McGill was, as is usual for him, a stand out. The story itself was kinda hokey and predictable. I gave it a 6 for story, and an extra point for the photography.",7,1,3,14 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The lesser Stars Wars
",Jar-Jar Binks You were a bore You had us gnashing our teeth and pulling our hair Simply not nearly as good as its predecessors. Nuff said.,5,0,1,25 December 2000
The Day After Tomorrow," Blah...blah..blah...SMASH...blah...blah...blah...
","Talk about clichéd and predictable. TDAT is simply a rehash of 70's disaster flicks with modern effects. I gave it a 5 on the IMDb scale. OK time waster, but don't expend even a trace of energy thinking about it, or you'll realize that you just threw away hard earned money. My biggest complaint was the number of story lines thrown in that were either filler, or never concluded. The Sela Ward character, and her storyline were the most obvious. The simple fact that she was the mother should have been enough, but then she was given the filler part with the terminally ill child. (wouldn't you at least attempt to move the child if it were the last resort instead of stupidly staying behind, knowing that it meant sure death?) Maybe it's me, but laying down in the face of adversity makes for crappy storytelling. There were many other examples of this simpleton stuff, but that was worse. Wait, maybe it was the end. Dad and assistant make it to NYC just as the storm breaks. Jeez, If he had just waited the 7 days, he could have taken the helicopter up! The real star was of course the FX division. They were impressive. Unfortunately, films built around FX generally lose out in the character and story area.",5,1,3,31 December 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," On it's own it's a decent flick, as part of the story, an unsatisfying conclusion
","Saw the flick opening day, third show of the day. I went in with little expectations. After all, I loved the first, like the second, and was somewhat put off by the direction they were heading. I pretty much figured out what was going to happen from watching Reloaded several times.THERE WILL BE MANY SPOILERS COMING...	So, to digress slightly, #1 was and opening, giving us the basic outline and introducing characters. A great flick, definitely one of the all-time great scifi's. #2 moved the story along, but wasn't near as groundbreaking. The story lines weren't all that. #3should be the climax, the conclusion. But we are left with a huge hole that isn't filled. So why... 	Well, to the makers credit, they made a decent film. Sure most of the acting is stilted, and the dialogue is corny, but it is somewhat great in it's own right. As a part of The Matrix story though, it's dull, muddled and ultimately unsatisfying. Look at the titles. The Matrix Reloaded, pretty much what it implies, more and more of what made the first so good. Maybe a little too much. The Matrix Revolutions, huh, did I miss something, there was no revolution folks, Revelations, ok there were a few of those, but no revolutions. And this is just for starters... 	The first had all the mythology, and pseudo-religious overtones. The third reveals that all of that was pretty much a lie. It's all based in a man/machine world. The Cynics of Zion were correct, he is no savior. He's an extremely poor negotiator. The end of the film pretty much blows away everything the brothers had worked so hard to establish in the first. Love, faith, the enduring spirit of man, are all cast aside by Neo in the end. At the end of the first, he said I'm going to show them what you don't want them to see', and he delivers. We saw an extremely unsatisfying conclusion. Neo forsake the people of Zion, and the folks caught up in the world of the Matrix, to help the machines conquer an out of control program that they helped create. 	Hello! The title is Revolutions. There was no revolution. The great battle ended without a victor. Just a very fragile treaty.  The Architect says those who want, will be set free. This is garbage to the extreme. Mankind by nature does not want to be kept in bondage, and these weren't the conclusions so easily defined in #1. But now it's apparent that Neo isn't working for Zion, he is a machine. So everything stated in #1 about faith and believing was all lies. Morpheus was duped, all the believers were.  We should have at least been shown the aftermath in Zion when everyone found out what it was exactly that Neo did. It seems Cypher was right all along, better to be reinserted into the Matrix, then live he way they were. Morphues would have been strung up by his Buster Browns.	Why do I say all this? Because now it has to start all over again. And this is where filmmaking bugs me. In 5 or 6 years, a new set of (cheap) actors, More money spent on Special Effects, less on story development, (it's done now), to tell the whole darn thing again. Why? Because the Architect says so. It has to be done to keep the Matrix in balance, or whatevr he calls it. This Matrix had no conclusion. It was supposed to be rebuilt, and never was. The fields will still be grown for harvesting, and eventually those in bondage will get the same sense that Trinity and the others got in the first. Someone has to stand up and say, Let my people go'. It's human nature. 	We are the cattle. And the brothers are the herdsmen. I will not be pushed down a chute.",4,0,0,6 November 2003
"I, Robot"," Good old (futuristic) detective
","I read IA's books years ago as a child, and I was really looking forward to this film, (I don't read nearly as much as I used to, or would like to). As far as this being like the stories, much of it seemed new to me, or I don't remember large parts. But as a film this was really enjoyable. I found it to be entertaining, and never dull. Will Smith gives a good performance, not Oscar worthy, and just a tad over the top, but he keeps you locked on throughout. I loved the look of the film, mixing in old with new, showing a world in transition, similar to Blade Runner, but not as bleak. The robots were quite amazing, and blended in well. Of course it had a story and characters with a little meat! Unlike my last review for The Day After Tomorrow. So the effects simply added to the story instead of just being the story. As far as I was concerned this was just a 1950's style detective movie set 80 years into the future. I really liked it, and would recommend it as a movie to watch, especially to people who hate movies with bloated FX. This gives you both, and you kind of forget the FX, which is the way it should be.",8,0,0,31 December 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Moments of flash, with a lot of trash...
","I know the point. I grew up on many of the films he hits upon in the movie. But you know what, he went too far. It's all right to give your nods to the filmmakers you love, but there were just so many, that it's not even his film anymore. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed much of the movie. Great camera work, limited use of wirework, the music was amazing, and it is very stylish. But there is no need for two movies. There is so much that is wrong with the two-movie plan. Without even seeing Vol. 2, I can say that his could have been edited into a very crisp, butt kicking 2-½ hour rock 'em sock 'em powerhouse film.His non-linear timeline is obviously an attempt to structure Vol. 1 so as to get the huge fight placed at the end. When actually it's the beginning, (after the church massacre). While it is a cinematic treat of excess, it could have been honed down, and given its proper place to hook you in one long flick. See my personal opinion is that something went to QT's head during the making.  Far too many references are going to go right over peoples' (the average moviegoer) heads. There were things I recognized right away, things I knew but couldn't place, and some things that I missed. And I've seen most of the movies he has referenced in articles, the credits, and movie connections listed here at ImdB. All in all I would have to say I was disappointed. I gave it a 5 here for average. There were parts that bored, parts that were very very good, and parts that could have been dropped completely. Like the anime; sorry, it was out of place in the context of what he was doing. I know some will disagree with me on that. But for what he was working with, Revenge/Samurai/Shaw Brothers, anime did not belong there. And considering how well done it was, it was probably a fair size chunk of the budget. If he had done away with that 10 minutes, removed some of the repetitive narrative, trimmed down some of the excess, then combined the 2 films, I think it would have worked, and would have been great. Oh well...",5,0,1,11 October 2003
War of the Worlds," A really good, so close to great it hurts, popcorn flick
","I rated WOTW an 8 out of 10. I really enjoyed it. Basing it on the 1953 George Pal flick, I thought it was nearly as good, taking into account the f/x of the new vs. the old. The key 'redone' scene at the farmhouse was actually more exciting then the original, in my opinion. And the makers did a decent job in updating it from the original. Making Tom Cruise a part time Dad was good, as it seems to reach back to ET, when there was no Dad in the film. Here, he could be that Dad. And keeping it simple, isolating a small family, rather then concentrating on the military, as was done in Independence Day, made for a much more suspenseful film. Although, I would have liked to have seen a much more detailed battle in the countryside with the military, like in the original film. But at least they stayed away from nukes. The fact that there were only quick meetings with the Army worked though. That the son wanted to join the fight was a bit contrived, IMO, because he didn't seem to show those tendencies early on. In fact he seemed to be more aloof and alone in his solitude at the beginning. Of course, we only met him when he was dropped off for the weekend, so there could be a little more to him, but I just got the feeling he wasn't really like that, or his character wasn't fleshed out enough to want to see him join up. The biggest letdown was the ending. I just knew SS wouldn't allow the son to die, and I thought this was the BIGGEST detraction of the film. Thinking about the death in hindsight, no major character dies, ( Tim Robbins was not a major character, a mere cameo, unnecessary at that. More on that in a bit). Because of the fact that no one of record dies, it's hard to imagine Ray ever growing up, or learning anything about family etc. The fact that only a couple of minor characters die on film really doesn't allow us to build up any rage at being invaded. This is where the original film really brought us in. The audience were witness to several key deaths that brought them into the film. And the other big detraction, the crazy cameo! Who was that masked man! An ambulance driver? An AWOL soldier? A death row pervert who managed to escape? I couldn't figure it out! Maybe all three. He was an unnecessary addition to an otherwise well done farm house scene. The fact that Ray had to kill him, (off screen, so did he really? Or maybe he just gagged him, knowing he would have to leave him for dead), did nothing for his character. You think it would, and the fact that it was done behind closed doors, would give you a new more mature Ray, but I didn't get that feeling. I got nothing out of it. Otherwise the updated farmhouse was great. Technically, the film was a marvel. It's so nice to see so many f/x shots of this magnitude done in daylight. WOTW puts ID4 and the like to shame in that manner, and I really enjoyed ID4 on that level. The first attack on Jersey and the final Boston fight were fantastic, nary a glitch on first viewing. And the set up in the basement leading to the scene of the downed aircraft was really exciting, I wasn't expecting a crashed jet, and what a set piece that was. All-in-all a really good , so close to great, popcorn flick. and I will probably see it again in the theaters, and it will definitely be an addition to my getting-so-huge-my-wife-is-complaining-about-it DVD collection. (At least it takes up a heck of a lot less room then my 20+ years of VHS collecting.",8,2,6,3 July 2005
Ray," An extraordinary portrayal
","One of the best bio-films I've ever seen. About the only thing I would have like to have seen more of was his early life, and mastering the piano. I think the scene where he is introduced to the instrument was way to short. He talked of his ability to mimic his favorite artists, but we didn't get to see the progression. Foxx's rendering of Ray is truly Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast was exceptional too. Regina King should be getting nomination too. Taylor Hackford did a great job, except what I noted above, he stayed on theme throughout. This film mostly reminded me, in style, of The Buddy Holly Story. This film is a must see, even if you aren't a fan of Ray's music, if there are any.",9,0,1,15 November 2004
Identity," Hitchcockian in the 1st degree
","My wife and I found this to be a very entertaining edge of your seat thriller. Lots of jumpy moments, and very little blood letting, which is a relief. We had it figured out pretty much 1/3 of the way through, but it still made for an entertaining evening in front of the fire. I think maybe the filmmakers gave us to much info. Our only problem was the timeline; we felt it was out of sync between the Rivers storyline and the motel. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that. We also felt that the ending was to simplistic, and extremely Hollywood typical. I likened it to the end of Carrie in a way. The cast was first rate; I didn't even recognize DeMornay at first. Make sure you pay attention at the beginning, and I think you enjoy this.",7,0,2,1 January 2005
