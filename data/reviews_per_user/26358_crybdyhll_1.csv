Hereditary," Hope for 21st century horror ? Debatable.
","The movie is pretty good but not incredible.
I watched it with my sister and I guess the average audience member would find it disturbing- though I'm racking my brain as to why.
I appreciated the minimal use of CGI and their use of old school methods for effects- many modern horror films go so far they seem larger than life and unreal, this film didn't strike me that easyI found all of the actors well suited for their roles and the story wasn't a carbon copy of every other supernatural film- specifically those produced in the last 10 years.Unfortunately, I was left unimpressed. It ended with many things unexplained- not in a 'waiting for more' way, rather a 'this was just something they decided to include but had nothing to do with the progression of the film.'If you're an avid horror fan, this movies good but won't shock you. If you aren't, it's possible you'll be staring at the corners of your ceiling at night.",7,3,4,11 June 2019
