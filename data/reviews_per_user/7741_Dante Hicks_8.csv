Antz," Another triumph for animation
","Once again showing that animated films often have better plots, more humour and far greater emotional pull Antz delivers very well. Brilliantly cast throughout Woody Allen especially shines as (What else) a neurotic, physically and aggressively diminutive misfit whose non-conformist attitude sets him against the engrained Ant culture of self-sacrifice and collectivity over the individual. Although the Marxist undertones are obvious they are well put and not too in-your-face. They also show animators desire to open up this market to adults as well as children. Funny, scary and absorbing this film pushes all the right buttons as it's perfectly timed 80 minutes elapse. One to watch, even without the kids.",9,1,1,13 May 2000
Fight Club," It doesn't get much better than this
","Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men ('No great war to fight, no great depression'), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days.",10,442,720,25 June 2000
Blade," Surprisingly Good Comic Book Adaptation
","Having seen this only after watching 'The Matrix' I can tell where the latter film got all of it's ideas. Subway and Lobby scenes, graphic martial arts, thumping music. All present and correct, and though 'The Matrix' does all of these things better and is in general a far superior film you have to give it up to 'Blade' for thinking of them first. I admit though that like many people I watched 'Blade' without the faintest idea about the comic book it was based upon and I still don't know anything about it. Like many big screen versions of such comics it fails in that it tries to deliver to both fans and newbies alike. Frankly I got the idea but I got the definite feeling that there was a lot more back story and a whole new universe which wasn't particularly well expressed throughout the film. Also, the similarities to the TV series 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' were quite obvious, though who came up with it first is debatable. Basically I liked it though Snipes brooding, invincible character made the film a little too clearcut. The man seemed to have no weaknesses, either emotional or physical, and so it was clear to me who would 'out'. Still, it's unlikely that 'The Matrix' would have turned out to be such a brilliant film had it not been for this merely average actioner so hats off to it for that.",7,0,1,20 May 2000
American Pie," Not that funny but a good film none the less
","Considering the immense publicity given to the film and it's more 'noticeable' bits I was somewhat surprised to find myself not the least bit shocked by the whole thing. Sure it was funny but not laugh out loud funny, not the burst my sides laughing funny that I had expected. I actually found it to be a good film on it's own, more of a nineties spin on the old John Hughes tales of growing up and wondering exactly who you are and what you want. The fact that the main focus of the film was sex changed nothing as it more than emphasised the fact that sex is only truly great when you are with someone you love. It also placed safe sex prominently, yet subtlely, in the window. It also marked something of a radical shift in teen films by not strictly placing every one in a distinct social group (The band nerds aside). The fact that the four main characters hung around with each other despite their apparent differences made the film more realistic in my opinion than the clearly divided 'The Breakfast Club' fivesome. It was more 'Ferris Bueller's' and was all the better for it. Stifler was a truly brilliant character and I hope teen film writers take a leaf from this movie in how to deal with the 'cool, rich' male leads. To label this film a 'gross out movie' is to completely misunderstand it. I found myself agreeing for the first time ever with Leonard Maltin that it's a good film with it's heart in the right place. Not overly moralistic or totally without decency it takes a good stab at what it's really like to be an 18 year old on the brink of entering a world unlike anything they've seen before. I liked it, but not because it's got masturbatory gags or endless sex remarks, but because it dealt with issues and a context never before seen in teen movies. The one major downer about it though is that it's going to usher in a whole bunch of other teen sex comedies each going further than the one before and getting worse with it. Mark my words.",7,0,0,17 January 2000
The Game," Super-dupa
","What a fantastic movie, inspired even. It doesn't seem that interesting at first glance and the set-up is a little slow but after that, when Douglas's character goes to CRS to start his 'game' the film immediately hits top gear and is brilliant right up until the end. The genius behind it is that, unlike some other psychological thrillers like Perfect Blue et al, you know what's going on and what the current state of play is but you have no idea how it's going to end or whether CRS really are out to kill him. The pacing from Conrad's invitation on is perfect and to see the way Michael Douglas's in-control businessman is turned inside our by what he sees as 'depraved children' is very engrossing. It's difficult to put into words just how great this film is without getting my words into a tizz or giving away the plot. Needless to say everything about it is fantastic from the acting to the beautiful script to the hugely atmospheric photography. Brilliant, get it out, love it, buy a copy, love it some more.",9,0,1,24 June 2000
The Sixth Sense," Absorbing
","Though after seeing this film I didn't come out quite as impressed as some of my friends did it is still a very good movie. Bruce Willis turns in a surprisingly intelligent, gentle performance and is matched step for step by Haley Joel Osmont, who shows what child actors can do if they are both good and blessed with a decent script. The well-documented twist at the end, though not that well filmed in itself, is still the best since 'The Usual Suspects' and as a result one really done need to watch it twice.",8,0,0,27 May 2000
Cube," Unusual
","Great idea for a film. Put a group of disparate people in what is essentially a puzzle box and watch as they valiantly battle fiendish traps and complex mathematical problems. As none of them remember why or how they woke up in the 'Cube' intrigue and mistrust follow them around and build up to a series of confrontations in which secrets and revealed and violent madness breaks out. This film kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole 90 minutes as the prisoners used their talents and discovered more and more what was happening to them. Also, with several being minced in quite hideous ways there was a question of 'who next?'. Not quite genius but close, though not for the squeamish.",8,0,1,3 May 2000
Gladiator," Just short of a masterpiece
","This is a terrific movie which combines fantastic action, a good plot and one of the finest leading characters seen in a long time into a undeniable classic. Russell Crowe's casting as Maximus is perfect and he produces a magnificent performance as the invincible Roman General who's nobility, honour and fearless composure in all things win over everyone. He is a born leader and warrior who has only one dream: to defeat all who oppose his Emperor and to retire back to his Spanish farm with his wife and son. When those things are taken from him by the ruthless Commodus his initial welcoming of death becomes tempered as he sees a way to return vengeance upon those who have destroyed him. Ridley Scott deserves most of the congratulations as it is he who once again delivers us the kind of movie he is capable of making, beautiful, graphic but above all else utterly absorbing. The special effects and the music are amazing and serve to draw you completely into the film as its story unfolds and not once do you find yourself thinking 'Nah, that didn't look real'. If they had to complete some of Oliver Reed's scenes without the great man then the join is invisible and goes to show exactly how well the money was spent. Without a doubt THE summer blockbuster of 2000.",10,0,0,27 May 2000
