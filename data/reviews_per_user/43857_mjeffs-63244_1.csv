First Man," Well crafted biopic.
","I was tentative watching this film due to casting of Ryan Gosling in the lead. After watching it several times he is utterly superb. In fact there is little to fault about this film. The direction, cinematography, script and soundtrack are all of a high standard. The film does a great job of underplaying the moments of genuine drama in the film and builds nicely to the films climactic moon walk. It also nicely avoids Hollywood biopic cliches. Rather than going for bombastic impact it's focus on the drama generated by the interactions between the characters. If you have even a passing interest in the space race put this film at the top of your watchlist.",8,0,0,17 December 2019
