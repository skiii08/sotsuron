Men in Black 3," A brilliant heart warming sequel
","For me, this film has everything you would want from the men in black world. The script is fantastically written, brolin is perfectly cast. It's hilarious all the way through and surprisingly heart warming. Even now, after a few watches the closing lines between smith and jones always get me choked up. This is the perfect sequel and is lots of fun",8,3,4,15 June 2019
