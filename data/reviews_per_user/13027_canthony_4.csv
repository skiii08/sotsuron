Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An alternate movie
","I often find myself wondering if I have really gone to see the same movie as the other reviewers.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to even attempt to identify with their take.  I have seen Episode I twice now and I am fairly apathetic about it.  I don't have any intentions of seeing it again - in fact, I don't think I could sit through it.  Yet one of the reviews I read said that there was a full minute of applause when the movie ended.  I don't believe one clap came up in the theatre I was in .  Among me and my fellow viewers there seemed to be a general disinterest in the film.  However, I am not saying the movie was bad.  If it were unrelated to the Star Wars series, I am sure I would have loved it.  But this movie truly hurt the series. Lucas put in parts which twist the trilogy plot in ways which cannot be repaired.  Jar-Jar can be forgotten (which I am trying to do quickly) but we cannot forget the introduction of 'mitochloridons' or whatever they were. This adds a useless scientific aspect to the force which merely muddies the plot.  We also cannot simply forget the fact that Anakin was made a to be a little too similar to Jesus (a saviour with no father...hmm).  These are continuing elements added to the storyline which will carry through the next two movies and even effect our view of the original 3.  Combined with the fact that many critical situations were resolved by slapstick accidents and that Jar-Jar was more annoying than C3P0 could ever aspire to be, this movie is mere filler compared to the first three.  If you remove the special effects, I think we would find very little left.On a side note, I thought the Jedi were very well done and entertaining.",6,0,1,28 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," The Pointless Horseman
","I am always shocked when I see the extents to which people have gone to praise a movie which just wasn't that good.  To these people I have to ask, what on earth are you talking about?  No, Sleepy Hollow was not unbearable or terrible.  It was simply uninteresting.  And that in itself is shocking. How can you make a movie about a demon with no head who chases people down on a black horse and chops of their heads uninteresting?  It would have seemed impossible before SH, but Burton pulled off a miracle.  The movie bogs itself down with plot and attempts to add a conspiracy element which simply does not work.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the movie should simply have focus on the horseman himself - but instead by the end of this movie we think of the horseman more like a robot or mindless animal - not the truly evil being he could be.  I think the feel of the initial scene was successfully creepy, but few other instances in the movie succeeded in raising any fright.  I think Johnny Depp went about as far with the role as he could, but I was underwhelmed with Christina Ricci.  I also expected to see more of Walken, but I suppose since his character starts out the movie dead, you can't expect too much.  All in all, not Tim Burton's best work, and probably the worst of the last four movies I have seen (Dogma, Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, The World Is Not Enough).",6,0,0,22 November 1999
Being John Malkovich," Surreal, but not enlightening.
","It is often difficult when leaving a movie this weird to tell exactly what you thought of it.  I was pretty sure with this one that I liked it, but I had to think a while what made the movie so clever.   After some consideration, I do not agree that this movie really raises any philosophical questions or provides a new perspective on identity or such things.  Any points where a difficult conceptual situation arises is dealt with more by humor than with wisdom.  But like Brazil and even the Fifth Element, its genius lies directly in its weirdness, and how it simply attacks the stability of one's preconceptions and beliefs in general. After a movie like this, life just doesn't seem so simple any more, so closely bound by rules.  And this movie, I think, does it better than any other. Outrageous plot aside, every character, down to their reactions to each event, is so wholly absurd that it is just too much insanity to process all at once.  But in the end, after a slight change in one's mindset (and perhaps a slight loss of sanity), the nonsense does seem to make quite a bit of sense.  It is impressive that a movie so bizarre could still be so coherently put together.  Many surreal movies, such as some Kubrick and the aforementioned Brazil kind of leave you completely lost at the end, but this one doesn't leave many holes.  I think that just about anyone will leave the movie feeling odd but with no regrets.  As a side note, the acting in all cases is also superb.  For each main actor, it is probably their best performances.  As I said, the characters are so odd, it must have been quite a task to make them seem at all real.  As another side note, the puppeteering is amazing.  If you can do such things with puppets, then I would certainly care to be exposed to more of it.",9,0,0,13 November 1999
The Lion King," I am so tired of this movie.
","I wasn't going to comment on this one, but I was inspired by the review before me.  This person along with thousands of others obviously have seen a different 'The Lion King'  than me because the one I saw was mediocre at best.  Although I still give it a five, I think that it is unquestionably the worst Disney epic ever.  I find the music to be extremely forgettable, if not downright irritating at some points, and the plotline erratic.  And don't get me started about the nonexistent love story which we are supposed to buy.  This movie also breaks several Disney rules which I have come to expect, like the mysterious singing from the heavens (almost all Disney epics have all the music sung by actual characters).  To make a long rant short,  I disliked this enough that I have not seen a Disney cartoon since.",5,1,22,30 April 1999
