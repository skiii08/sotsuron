The Longest Yard," Two Thumbs Down
","This is the first Adam Sandler movie that I did not love..I just could not get into the film at all..I actually dozed off a couple times..My wife enjoyed it, but I thought it could have been much better with the actors that played in it..If it was not for the professional wrestlers that had supporting roles, the movie would have been a total disaster..Kevin Nash really impressed me in this movie and gave me my only chuckles..One other bright spot, if that is what you want to call it, is the dress Courtney Cox is wearing, I'm definitely guessing that she has had some augmentation done since here last work..I ain't mad at her..Wait 'til this remake comes to TV..Not even worth the cost of a rental.",4,2,5,19 June 2005
I Am Legend," Don't be fooled!!!
","If you want to see a great first half of a movie, then this one is for you. Unfortunately the 2nd half of the movie left me feeling like I really just threw $12 down the IMAX toilet. Character development was poor. There were some flashback scenes that poorly tried to develop some things, but all in all, the only character I cared about was the dog. The movie seemed to make up the rules as it went along and kept me asking how could this be happening now? I mean really, there are infected zombie like humans that don't know what they are doing. Oh wait now all of a sudden one of them knows how to form an army and train infected zombie dogs???? No spoiler there it is in the trailer. I agree with some other reviews, that maybe with a little more character development this movie may have been much better if it were 30 minutes longer. OVerall the 1st half of the movie was great, the 2nd half was poor, and the ending was horrible.",5,13,27,18 December 2007
