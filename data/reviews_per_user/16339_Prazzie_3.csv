The Blair Witch Project," Basically, this should have been The Blair Witch Failure.
","I heard about this movie from my boyfriend, who got it on DVD from his friend.  According to the friend, this is the scariest movie ever made. Although I had read some bad reviews I decided to watch it anyway, to satisfy my curiosity.  I came to the conclusion that this movie is THE WORST movie I have ever seen.  Contrary to the hype, there are NO thrills in this movie.  The quality of the filming is bad, maybe purposefully, but it does not add to the authenticity of the movie, it only gives the unfortunate viewer a headache.  The story starts out okay, but then it goes to a virtual standstill, with nothing happening for 60 minutes.  When things eventually start happening the viewer gets excited, only to be let down.  This happens time and time again, you get excited, wait for it, wait for it...bummer, nothing.  I told the story to my mother in four sentences, that is all there is to this movie.  No character depth, no real plot, no satisfactory scary scenes.  This movie is one big let down.  I was looking forward to the ending...unfortunately it turned out to be the worst part of the movie.  I was left feeling frustrated, uncertain about what exactly had happened at the end, completely and utterly UNSATISFIED.  I would usually say: 'try harder', but this time my advice to the creators of this film would be: 'Quit now.  Please?'",1,0,1,6 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice family entertainment, not new, but fascinating nevertheless.
","I am 16 and have never seen a Star Wars movie in my life.  I was just never into space-films.  My boyfriend persuaded me to watch this movie with him, and to my surprise I really enjoyed it.  The story is fascinating, the special effects are on par with the high standards modern movie-goers expect.  All in all, this was a nice film, not brilliant, not memorable, but entertaining.  The characters are classic, the villains are as evil as can be, the heroes look like real mommy's boys.  I was pleasantly surprised. Most impressive bits?  THOSE LIGHTSABERS!  WHooSH!  I want one!",7,4,6,6 August 1999
Scream," Classic thriller, a real Saturday-night-on-couch-with-lover movie.
","This was a really good movie.  Even though we've seen this type of movie thousands of times before, it still remains spine-chillingly scary.  So what if it is predictable, it is fun!  This is what scary movies should be about, take the innocent young girl, put her alone in a big house with a psychopathic killer lurking around and WHAM, you've got a hit.  That is the ultimate recipe for scary movies.Drew Barrymore's performance is gut-wrenchingly real.  The actors in this movie portray terrified and confused teenagers with endearing realism.  I thought this to be a really good movie, perfect for Saturday nights with your bf/gf, cuddling on the couch and eating popcorn.  Typical Hollywood, classic horror, thanks Wes!",7,0,0,7 August 1999
