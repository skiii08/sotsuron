Resident Evil: Afterlife," The Worst Resident Evil
","Hey it's TVGuy3, and sadly this is the only movie I'll be reviewing this week, since my cousin said the Virginity Hit is a big steaming pile of trash. Anyway, I was a big fan of the Resident Evil franchise ever since it came out on PlayStation. The first movie was a great shocker, the second almost rivaling the first, and the third was showing signs of decline. Now with Afterlife, the fourth installment, I was just looking for a popcorn movie. And it is. But the first three all also functioned as real horror movies. This one is just slashing and shooting. Don't get me wrong, it's a really capable slashing and shooting and Milla Jovovich gives a great performance, but this movie honestly needed more plot. Or a new director. Paul W.S. Anderson is not a good director. Let's just get that out of the way. The thing the first three movies were lacking was good direction. Luckily, the script and the acting were good enough to scare us. But like I said before, the script and acting is just slashing and shooting, which makes the bad direction even more visible. If you're not a fan of the franchise, this is a good horror flick. But if you're a fan of the first three, don't waste your money and be disappointed. If you want slashing and shooting with a real plot, go see Machete. Not this.",5,10,23,11 September 2010
The Town," Stick With Directing, Ben! TvGuy3's Review of The Town
","The Town is a bank robbery movie about a robber (Ben Affleck) trying to get his life in order. He can't decide between a happy life with his new girlfriend (Rebecca Hall) or staying a crook with his creepy buddy (Jeremy Renner). Renner gives such a good performance as a jerk in this movie that you would think he's a total a-hole in real life. You may know him from The Hurt Locker, last year's best picture (it should've been Avatar). Jon Hamm stars as a cop trying to stop Affleck and his friends but not persuasively enough that they pull off 2 more heists before the movie's over. This movie is elevated by great performances by Affleck and Renner, and Blake Lively is also good when she's on screen. Ben's last film in the director's chair was 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'The Town' proves he wasn't a one-hit-wonder. The Town is great and Ben Affleck can direct the hell out of a car chase. Go see it.Grade: B+",9,0,4,23 September 2010
