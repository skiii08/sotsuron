Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Somewhat Disappointing but Overall Pretty Decent
","I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard there was going to be a fourth POTC. I was very excited to see it but when i found out that Gore Verbinski wasn't directing the fourth installment, I knew that On Stranger Tides would be different than the others, and it was. The film was somewhat disappointing. As far as acting goes, Johnny Depp steals the show again and Geoffrey Rush and Ian Mcshane deliver solid performances. The action was superb but I didn't like the fact that more than half of the scenes were shot at night. Unlike the others in the series, this one was forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it was highly entertaining, just forgettable. Even though its a pretty decent film, compared to the previous installments, this one looks like a pile of crap. Another problem with this film is that it is nearly identical to the previous ones, just a different storyline and a few different characters. Don't walk into this movie with high expectations, this is more of a popcorn flick. If they do another pirates, please bring back some of the old cast and please bring back Gore Verbinski to direct.",6,0,1,9 June 2011
Super 8," Super 8 is this year's Inception
","Super 8 was an excellent movie. It's not your typical alien movie where some monster runs around blowing crap up, this one actually has a story. I think that J. J. Abrams is getting better and better. His Star Trek reboot was an instant classic and he did a FANTASTIC job with this film. Steven Spielberg was outstanding as usual. This movie doesn't have star power, but part of what made this film work was the chemistry between the cast members (particulary between Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning). The cast members in this film are incredibly talented. So if you add J. J. Abrams plus Steven Spielberg, plus a good plot, script, special effects and cast, what do you get?.......A Truly OUTSTANDING FILM. Did I mention that this film is mysterious, action packed, dramatic, sometimes scary, and funny? All of these components add up to make this worthwhile and very entertaining. This movie is this year's Inception, and that means its AMAZING.",10,4,9,10 June 2011
