The Blair Witch Project," The critics must be on crack!!
","After about fifteen minutes of wondering how the hell somebody's home movie had made it to the big screen, we decided not to get up and walk out only because we thought that maybe this completely boring experience was supposed to be considered artsy and we should try to appreciate it.  But Oh My God, it sucked so bad!  The only thing scary about this movie was the big ball of tear stained, snot dangling from the actress's nose while she was confessing to the camera.  Unless of course your afraid of rocks and sticks.  The constant jerky movement of the camera combined with the perpetual whining amongst the characters almost makes you want to puke.  In total, even though I do agree the idea of the unknown is more frightening than the known, this movie is seriously a joke.  It's good only in the fact that no movie like it has actually made it this far and somebody is actually making a lot of money off of it and I can't say that I wish it wasn't me.  So I'll be in my back yard filming the horror of the weeds taking over my lawn for the next four months.  See you in the movies!",Null,0,1,5 September 1999
