Spartacus," Spartacus Review
","When you watch Spartacus with all actors and actress within, you feel not only they successfully convey the true story but you live within the sequence itself.The first impression you think it's from this Millennium but actually it's 45 years ago !The Cinematic effect and the visual effect at that time wasn't supported with advanced technology, and I think because the actors and actress are talented,even the director and the crew are doing the best work to succeed the movie.All efforts from Actors and Actress creating interactive live event, there's originality in this Film and the way the director trying to convey his vision with the reality combined altogether harmoniously ! The characteristic of Spartacus defined with integrity, he is a leader a lover and a freeman, Mr. Douglas still have that impression in his daily life, also, the other actors which obviously dominating the movie, each of them doing impressive role.Spartacus Film, is one of the best ever movie released in 60's and compete Millennium era.We send our love to all actors and actress and the crew.by Aras",10,3,6,18 June 2005
