Conquest 1453," I am ashamed of being Turkish
","I just watched the film and i tried to laugh to hide my anger. This film has zero acting, awful visual effects, a cheesy romance scenes and very differs from historical reality. Costumes are very cheaply designed.I was very hopeful this time, it would be great to see a war film about Istanbul but now i feel so ashamed because the other countries will watch it and see that our country still make AWFUL films.I think This film is made for one scene.. 'All army pray in battlefield'. (That is not possible in reality). This film is made for politicians.I am a Turkish girl and i will not ever WEAR a scarf in my head, this is what they are trying to do in our country. Do not go and pay for this cause.Now i have to watch Lord of the Rings trilogy 10 times to forget this Conquest 1453 movie.",1,91,200,19 February 2012
