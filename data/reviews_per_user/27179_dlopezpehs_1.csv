Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Awesome,but something feels like it's missing
","I find that Sherlock Holmes:Game of shadows was an E.M.P.(Epic.Master. Performance.).But I just feel that somehow they left something behind from the first one. WARNING, THE REST OF THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! I'm not sure what it was. The movie had a great script,amazing actors, suspenseful scenes, and plenty of twists(my favorite). The very end was one of my most greater surprises from the movie. I think something that was both a great and yet disappointing element, was when Sherlock takes some time to plan and we get to see some thing that happens before it actually does.This is great because people might learn from this and it's great to see just how intelligent Sherlock is. But there is a trade-off , people can get bored of spoilers and feel the time could have been used for something else. The introduction of new characters was a help to the overall plot an performance. But like I said, it still feels like something's missing. I'm not sure what it is that keeps me from giving 10 out of 10 stars",8,2,4,6 March 2012
