The Blair Witch Project," boring, plotless let-down of a horror flic...
","i was really excited to get to see this movie finally after hearing all the hype and going to the web site.. but the blair witch project was in desperate need of some sort of plot development, perhaps a climax or something..  i understand the concept of the movie, and i admit it's a very creative film that finally broke the mold of the rampant 90's teeny-bopper 'horror' movies... but the plot really just boils down to a road rules episode with a twist of horror.  the 3 characters are lost in the woods, they're all mad at each other and want to go home.  the whole thing centers around a flimsy legend that some people still buy into even after the 'behind the scenes' show reveals its falsity...all in all, it's not worth $7.00 to see a plotless movie whose only redeeming aspects are its 16mm cut and its originality (which does not go past the basic concept).",3,1,4,16 July 1999
