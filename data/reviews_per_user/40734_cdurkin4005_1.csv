Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mind-blowing Satire
","Many times I've seen the phrase 'outrageously funny' applied to a movie. This is the first movie I've ever seen where that phrase is literally true. This movie truly is an outrage. It's terrific! I was still laughing the next morning. It's a deeply scathing satire, not on Kazahkis, but on Americans. You won't believe the lengths the actors go to for this film. The big debate will be who is worse, the ultra-crude almost uncivilized Borat, or the red-state Americans he interacts with. At least for Borat, we can say he doesn't know any better. There is also a lot of fun with a chicken and a bear and the words to the Kaxakhi 'national anthem' are worth memorizing. You have to see this movie.",9,3,11,12 November 2006
