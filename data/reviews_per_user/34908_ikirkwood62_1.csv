3:10 to Yuma," This movie was so bad, I don't understand how some people like it.
","Now, I heard quotes saying things like ' The best Western since UNFORGIVEN' And, being a fan of unforgiven, I wanted to see this movie. Of course, After the movie's End, I realized that it was the ONLY Western since UNFORGIVEN. So, naturally, it had to be the best. You see, if they had made any other movie set in the west, even spongebob squarepants, then that would have been better than this PC piece of Crap. Now I remember watching John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies, and being so happy when the badguy died/got sent to jail. So, I got very excited for the ending. So what i thought was going to be an action packed Wild Western Shoot out turned out to be a running scene set to unfitting music where the bad guy (Spoilers/PC part) turns good, willingly gets on the train, and kills all of his outfits members for killing his captor because he wanted his captor to be a 'Hero'. This Movie is a Failure and belongs in the Bottom 100.",5,12,23,16 January 2008
