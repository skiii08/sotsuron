Walk the Line," A strong execution of a difficult subject
","By difficult, I don't mean to say that bio pics aren't common, even dime a dozen, or that they are attempting something new. What I mean is that it takes extraordinary ability to rise above the normative bio pics and make a piece which is masterful and genius in its own right, not just interesting to those who are interested in the subject matter.Pheonix plays Cash flawlessly. His deliberate, easygoing manner, his crooked half smile, and his twangy but honest voice. I give this film a nine out of ten not because I think it is better than ninety percent of the films ever made, but because it did an absolutely terrific job with the potential that it had. It is a very invovling, very real, very honest treatment of the life of Johnny Cash.",9,0,2,19 November 2005
Memento," By far the most creatively made movie I have ever seen.
","Simply amazing. I will admit that it has little redeeming quality message wise, but the film is superbly made, and is really an original creative work of art. I cannot even begin to fathom the technical complexities of writing a script chronologically from two points in time, having the story work from those two points toward each other until they meet in the middle, and make all of it make sense only then, and yet manage to build suspense and keep peoples' interest up to that point. Simply stunning acting on the parts of Carrie Ann Moss and Guy Pierce, and just enough comedy to keep it from being as dark as it could have been. The plot twists keep changing everything you already knew, and there are plenty of moments where you think, oh...so he did that because....oh. It is quite a roller coaster of a film and comes off artistically as about a nine out of ten.",9,1,5,15 August 2004
Alexander," wow.
","From the moment I saw the trailer for this epic, I was quite anxious to see it. I love Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer, Collin Farrel was fantastic in The Recruit and other films, and Oliver Stone was making it. How could it possibly go wrong? When it came out I was loathe to believe the reviews which slammed it and tore it to pieces, and finally I went to see it on the biggest screen I could find and I gave it the best chance it could have had. What a loser. This film, although just over three hours, feels like an eternity. The plot wanders all over and feels far more like a made for TV docudrama than a major feature film. After the first scene or two the pace slows to a crawl, but does pick up for a battle scene or two. However even these which are well realized and intense briefly, fail to resolve, and we leave the battle field wondering what the heck just happened. I don't care how historically accurate or inaccurate it is, it is a horrible story. Perhaps Stone should have found one event around which to base the film instead of trying to give a passing overview. The characters were completely non-empathetic and there was simply no chemistry or development of his loves, both male and female. The real Alexander the Great may or may not have slept with his male friend, but I somehow doubt that he was the feminine eye-shadow sporting, sensitive lad that this film portrayed him as. Or if he was, they shouldn't have made a major Hollywood film about him because the market of people interested in such an antagonist is a tiny fraction of the typical filmgoing audience. All said and done, the horse vs. elephant sequence was brilliant (appart from some odd and poorly justified colour alteration) but the rest of the film had me glancing at my watch every few minutes, hoping that I could leave this disgrace of a film.",1,27,45,20 January 2005
