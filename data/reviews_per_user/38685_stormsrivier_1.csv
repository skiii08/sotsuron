Blade Runner 2049," Pretend this never came out.
","One really wishes that this time, this time a sequel to a classic will be worthwhile or even on par. Agreed it's a fine line to walk.For a short while it is even possible; the wishful thinking of reviews giving 9 and 10.But really, BR2049 is just DVD trash, bar some twinkle crumbs to feed off, meant for some Saturday night couch potato who didn't see the original with chips spice on his chest. First of all it looks too techie and gray, this is pure space movie kitsch. Could they not have been more original? Real originality is what it lacks. It tries too much to feed off the original Ã¡nd be clever. But all it is is obvious attempts at trying and failing at being clever. The audience ain't dumb like Hollywood suit monkeys. All the elaborate zooming, yawn. The good old johnny black; same square bottle but updated design. Odd attempt at humour is really placid, since the movie has no tension. The story line is one big eye roll with cheese to burn. Children, factions. Let's do emotional faces Somewhat reminds of the sequel to Matrix but luckily not nearly as bad. There are some good cinematography moments and Batista was actually the coolest character. The memory stick chick too.",3,4,8,6 November 2017
