The Ring," scary!
",This movie was scarier than hell! I loved this movie! Samara is the best and frightening! I can never watch Oliver Beene the same way again because Daveigh Chase is in it (Samara). She was soooo scary and I was the only one who got the plot out of my four friends! 10/10 *****,Null,1,1,23 April 2003
