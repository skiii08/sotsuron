The Expendables 2," Some action with no brains.
","I didn't expect much from this movie: A thin story line a lot of action scenes, a short and satisfying entertainment. I could live with this and would be happy But this movie is doing it wrong in so many ways. The story is dumb and all the interactions between the actors are empty or a reminder to one of their past, more successful movies. Every scene with some content is just a stupid clich√® and you have to feel ashamed for the actor.The story is straight forward without any twists and surprises. The 'anger factor' (Stallone's killed pseudo son) is so cheap and simple I couldn't adapt with that and favoured the bad team the whole movie. They should finally kill these bunch of action idiots, so they'll just stop talking.At the end a pure waste of time without any satisfaction. You can eat, read, play or even talk to your wife while watching this one without any danger to miss something.",1,1,2,20 November 2012
