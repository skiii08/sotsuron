The Young Victoria," Historic Bliss
","The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has presented Queen Victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her. The films wipes away the 'I am not amused' impression of Queen Victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman.As I love history, particularly Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised, i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I found out new facts about Queen Victoria that didn't know before and it interested me greatly.Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest Monarchs, and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like. She was treated so badly by her mothers adviser Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, which she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep and this was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who were both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of British History...I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!",10,2,2,28 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," What a disappointment for a POTC fan!!
","What a huge disappointment! I loved the first movie completely and is my favourite film, the second wasn't so good but i still loved it. So I was so excited about this movie to see the next part after the tense cliffhanger at the end of Dead mans chest. But i was so disappointed, it was way too long and i actually got bored by the end of it.Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were the only good part of it! Maybe the excitement and love for POTC is waring off now and the third movie was just not needed.Plus i feel it was released too soon after Dead Mans Chest, therefore there wasn't enough time to get excited about it. The fact that there is going to be fourth movie worries me, i don't want it to be a flop as I don't want to see my favourite movie fail. Fingers Crossed its better than At world end! Not great, but I still love Captain Jake Sparrow...total legend!! 7/10",7,0,1,15 December 2009
The Orphanage," Beautiful Film
","I am going to start off by stating that this film is simply beautiful, the camera work is stunning. There is no flashy or expensive camera or special effects used, or when they are they are subtle. This ads to its brilliance. I am not a big horror movie fan, and I say now I haven't watched many at all. I watched this movie in my Film Studies lesson and was terrified yet constantly fixed on the movie. I felt I was drawn in and challenged to find the outcome of the story and found out my predictions were not always correct.However, I found that you are more likely to enjoy the film if you believe in ghosts and the afterlife. If you are sceptic it might not be great for you as you need to go along with the fantasy of the movie.I really liked the movie surprisingly and was totally freaked out from beginning to end by its low lighting and eerie sounds and camera work that created the tension in the audience and what made everyone jump.Also, wasn't the social worker woman scary, with her thick glasses :)",8,1,3,21 June 2010
Avatar," I want be an Avatar!
","I must admit I wasn't totally excited about seeing Avatar, this was because it had so much hype, and usually they don't live up to their reputation...but Avatar DOES! Avatar was a wonderful experience that helps you escape into a more beautiful world of Avitars. I saw it in 3D and it was amazing, the graphics were flawless, and strange as it sounds, when there was breeze on the screen I could feel it on my face. It zoned me out so much that actually felt part of the film...Breathtaking! To add to this I was totally engrossed and amazed by how real the Avatars looked, like when Neytiri was crying it looked completely real! Oh I loved this movie! However, I felt that Avatar was a little boring at first, but it got better and once my head stopped spinning I fell in love with the movie and the gorgeous storyline drew me in, the romance and wonderful way of life was WOW! God I want to see it again now! I do think however that Avatar needs to be in 3D as it just adds to the experience as this movie is a emotional journey, that is what it is a journey!! Wonderful! I want to be an Avatar!!!!! 9/10",9,2,4,22 February 2010
A Hard Day's Night," Gotta Love the Beatles !!
","Firstly, I must confess before watching this film in Film Studies class I didn't really like The Beatles much... BUT now I love them and I regret moaning at my Dad playing them in the Car!! A Hard Days Night is simply fantastic as it lets us peek into the world of the four iconic lads from Liverpool: John, Paul, George and Ringo! Made in 1964 The Beatles had just hit their hight and making this film pushed them even higher.The Films simple plot of following the guys on their journey from Liverpool to London to perform a concert, is perfection. It doesn't need any fancy frills...it has the Beatles...What more could you want? As a 16 year old girl watching this film, I was so surprised that i loved it, the Beatles lets face it were gorgeous, and the music is simply magic. I recommend this film to any age group, even the young generation...just try it, you may like it!! Also, literally an hour ago I watched Paul Macartney on the X Factor, it was the best performance ever on that show...you have still and will always have it...Brilliant! A Hard Days Night...10/10 RIP John Lennon & George Harrison x",10,2,2,13 December 2009
