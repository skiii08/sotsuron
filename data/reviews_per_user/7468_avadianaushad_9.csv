Ford v Ferrari," Same old underdog story lifted by great screenplay and performances.
","Ford v Ferrari is about the egos of two business tycoons Henry Ford the second and Enzo Ferrari. Still it's less about these two and more about Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. This film is a perfect tribute to both of them and their contribution to the sport of racing.
What's good:
1. The screenplay is great and so is the direction. There are many great scenes and the director Jamed Mangold is able to make us feel exactly how he wanted to.
2. The performances by all the actors are great. Christian Bale gets the most heroic part of Ken Miles and he shines throughout the movie. Matt Damon's part is less heroic but he also does a good job. Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas and other actors have also done a good job according to their small roles.
3. The second half of the film is highly entertaining.
What's bad:
1. It is an underdog story and has certain predictable scenes that many underdog stories have.
2. There is only one female character Caitriona Balfe and her role is pretty small although she gets one good scene.
Christian Bale fans will love it and others will like it.",8,1,2,2 February 2020
Knives Out," A different kind of Murder Mystery
","As a fan of murder mystery movies, I'll have to say that most of them follow a formula.
There is a murder. There is a detective and after that you scratch your head till the end. Who did it? In the end you get the answer. But this film doesn't follow that formula. Ok it does follow the formula for half an hour. But after that it's a different film.
What's good:
1. As I said, the film doesn't stick to the formula genre film and takes a different route which works.
2. The actors have done a great job with what they were given especially Ana De Armas. You can call it her movie.
3. The film has comedy some of which is political as well.
What's bad:
1. Daniel Craig's role should have been better. He was wasted in the movie.
If you are a fan of Murder Mystery/Suspense movies, you'll love it.",8,0,3,7 February 2020
The Irishman," Great acting but length is the killer.
","What's good:1. The acting of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci is great. In my opinion, Al Pacino was the best among them as he got the best scenes.
2. The film is mostly realistic.
3. There are some really funny scenes and all of them are with Al Pacino.
4. I don't know how they made Robert De Niro look young but it works.
5. The message in the movie is great. I am not telling you because I don't want to spoil the movie for you.What's bad:
1. The length is 3 and a half hours. Due to this, it does get boring at times.
2. The film in a few scenes does get complicated.
3. The female characters barely get to do anything.
4. The ending could have been better. You took 3 and a half hours from us. At least give us a clear ending for that character.Overall, you can watch this film one time but without much expectations.",6,0,4,3 December 2019
Interstellar," A great sci-fi film with emotions
",A lot of people will recommend the movie because of Christopher Nolan or visual effects but I'll say watch the movie for the story and for showing the father-daughter emotion so nicely. The scene where Cooper (McConaughey) meets his daughter Murphy before leaving for the mission and the scene where he meets her after the mission are the best ones. Must watch for everyone.,10,0,1,30 June 2017
Pulp Fiction," Great film with hidden message.
","There are many characters in the movie with their own arcs and the movie is about how they affect each other.
Everyone is good but it is Samuel L Jackson who steals the show with his performance in the last scene.
If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading now because I am talking about the hidden messages in the movie.
Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta are two hitmen who work for a big gangster. Both of them are doing their routine job one day and have a near death experience.
Samuel thinks it's divine intervention and God wants him to leave this job.
He leaves the job and is saved but John doesn't.
John accidentally kills a boy after this because of his carelessness. His boss's wife ends up in a near death situation because of his mistake. He saves her but still doesn't leave the job and is killed.
Bruce Willis is a boxer who cheats the boss of Samuel and John by promising to lose a fight and winning it instead. He kills his opponent and has no regret. He kills John also because John was hired to kill him. He finally has a change of heart and saves that gangster from two people. The gangster forgives him and asks him to leave the town. This is how he is saved.
John (before getting killed) and Samuel go to a restaurant where a couple tries to rob everyone but Samuel takes his gun out and gives them all the money. He asks them to leave without fighting and they do. They are saved.
Quentin Tarantino wanted to show us that God gives us second chance and we shouldn't waste it. Otherwise we should be ready for punishment.",10,0,1,27 November 2019
Joker," Villains are not born. Society makes them one.
","Joker is the origin story of the Batman's arch-nemesis Joker.
Everyone was apprehensive before the film released as Heath Ledger had given such an iconic performance that nobody could think of anybody else playing a Joker. Jared Leto tried and failed.
But the film was great because it wasn't about the Joker. It was about a common man who ended up becoming one. That's why it worked. So let's start the review.
What's Good:
1. The story and screenplay of the movie is great.
2. The performance by Joaquin Pheonix made me his fan.
3. The director Todd Philips has done a great job by showing us Joker and the society as it is.
4. There are some scenes for DC Fans that I am not going to spoil.
What's bad:
1. The film isn't politically correct. So people who want political correctness should not watch it.
2. Robert De Niro was wasted in the movie. He deserved a better role.
3. No other actor is able to create any impact in the movie.
4. Not a family film.
DC Fans and Joker Fans will love it.",9,2,5,31 January 2020
Parasite," Great film with a message.
","I heard a lot of praise for this movie and decided to watch it.
I was quite apprehensive because it was a Korean film and I had to watch with subtitles.
But the film proved me wrong.
What's good:
1) The story and screenplay are great. There are no unnecessary scenes in the movie.
2) The performances are great especially Kang Ho Song who played the father in the movie.
3) The twists in the movie are really entertaining. There are moments where you will be shocked.
4) The message in the movie is really great.
5) The direction is really nice.
What's bad:
1) You can't watch the film with family.
2) The ending was good but predictable.
I would recommend it for anyone who wants to watch something different.",9,11,16,31 January 2020
Marriage Story," Great story, screenplay, direction and acting
","Marriage Story is a film about a couple getting divorced.
I won't get into too much details as I don't want to spoil the movie for others.
The story, screenplay, direction and acting are perfect.
There are a few scenes where the actors shine like the scene where
1. Scarlett Johansson explains her lawyer Nora why she wants divorce.
2. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson fighting with each other in Adam's apartment.
3. Adam reading the note that Scarlett wrote for him.
The only negative about the film would be that it can't be watched with family due to one scene and abuses.
I will give it a 9/10",9,4,5,23 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," A really great film with a message.
","The film starts out as a comedy and gets serious later. I won't spoil the movie by getting into too much details.
What's good:
1. The story and screenplay are great. It is based on the novel 'Caging Skies' by Christine Leunens.
2. Roman Griffin Davis gets the lead role of Jojo and he proves to be the biggest strength of the movie. All other actors have done a good job.
3. The film makes you laugh as well as think in some scenes.
4. The director shows us the power of Propaganda through this film and how one person can fool most of the people.
What's bad:
1. If you are looking for traditional entertainment, you should avoid this film.
2. Can't watch with family.
If you want to watch a different type of comedy drama, this is the film for you.",8,2,4,9 February 2020
