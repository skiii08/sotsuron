The Equalizer," A nice movie overshadowed by competition
","Honestly, i had fun watching this. There is probably plot holes and impossible stuff but who care? Its made to be an action type of movie. Yet that is the small problem i found in it. Its an action movie but the pacing is very slow. There is a few action scenes here and there, but way too few of them and sometimes even off screen...On the other hand the story is nice, Denzel play his part very good, Chloe do the job even tough the role is small. But maybe its because i saw John Wick before, i couldn't help myself but to compare the 2 and its obvious when you do, you realize one is an action fest on testosterone, the other a nice movie but that do lack something.The premise is not the same but similar, the bad guys are both Russian mobs, in both case the protagonist is a guy with super skills... And if i got to pick one, yes John Wick was much superior for me. But that does not mean Equalizer is not a good movie. Like i said, i had a good time, the movie is over 2 hours long yet i was not bored, despite it being slow paced. The character is interesting, the main bad guy acting and presence is nice, although i had higher hopes for him, and basically its what it is, just a good action movie.",7,0,2,25 December 2014
John Wick," Old school badassery at its best
","This movie truly feel like returning back in time, but with today's technology and style. It had a mix of Commando for the 'one man army' set-up but without the one liners and corny style. Keanu Reeves/John Wick definitely succeed at being both a bad-ass character, but somebody that you truly feel for.I was reading other reviews and one point that stand out also to me is even tough the movie is fast to start, there ain't too much build up, you still care a lot for that man. When the dog is kill, despite the short time he spent with it, i still felt his pain and grief. The guy had nothing left beside a dog and a car, and they took it from him.So yeah this movie is just pure old school greatness, like you don't see many these days. There is even a small role for Bloodsport's Daniel Bernhardt which was also in The Matrix Reloaded, and there first fight is extremely satisfying.The movie include lots of gunfights, a fair amount of hand to hand combat, some car chases scene, and pretty much everything you expect from an action movie, its really a great time.",8,8,22,4 November 2014
Silent Hill," Cooler Game to movie ever !!!
","To start, lets say I'm not a big fan of the game, played an hour of SH1, played around 4-5 hour of SH2, i really liked the atmosphere and the town etc, but I'm not very patient in video game, not a fan of infiltration or save ammo, in silent hill most of the time you had to watch carefully your ammo and finish monster with the pipe, plus i founded the story in the 2 kinda boring, it did not took place for what i tought, played 6 hour and the guy was still searching for his wife but no story development etc, it kinda bored me. The 1 i simply stopped cause the graphic aspect annoyed me considering its on the old playstation 1 and i tried to play it after the PS2 was released.This said i still liked the atmosphere and all, and when the movie start i was happy to see it was the same beginning(with the jeep) , the first scene of the first silent hill redone very well and very scary. Sure they changed the name of Cherril for Sharon but well...Harry was changed for that women(who look a lot like Heather of the 3) but in a way it was better i supposed considering the whole mother-child relation of the movie plus a man helped by a women cops...would have be weird in a movie.Anyway to return to the movie, i found it very scary, i was very nervous every time the horns was heard, the nightmare world was amazing, so scary and disturbing, and the pyramid head was one very cool monster, it was just too bad he was not more present and that he kinda disappear after a part of the movie. Would have like a lot to see him more.So overall i think even if the story is different from the game on some point, the way they kept monsters, places(school for example) , some scenes, that was really a great movie, and the closest adaptation of a game i saw. And also a very scary movie, i did not saw a scary movie like that in a long time.",9,2,4,23 April 2006
Suicide Squad," Don't listen to the so called 'critics' , the movie is fun
","This movie is super fun. Im gonna make it short, as everything probably been said many times. I was not fond of Will Smith being cast as Dead Shot, that's who i had in mind after watching the actor in Arrow. But Will Smith is so charismatic and fun he made me forget all about it. Marggot Robbie as Harley Quinn is just awesome. Even Jai Courtney is very good at Boomerang. Actually my only complain with this character is that there is not enough of him !!! lol The story is basic sure, but it work. Lots of great action. Look although i did like Deadpool, i tough this movie was even better, yeah no jokes.My only big problem with the movie is i am not a fan of Pimp Joker. I mean the actor did a great job with what he had to work with, but the look is completely off. Joker should NOT be tattooed, no matter if once in the comic he was or whatever. The street gang metal teeth look ridiculous too. But Jared Leto has the face for it tough, make up wise and hair colour, that was good. His acting was convincing.So yeah i had tons of fun with Suicide Squad, gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD for sure.",8,8,15,11 August 2016
We're the Millers," The Millers win, big time !
","As most people i saw the previews, tough it could be funny, so i rented it and i was extremely surprise that it was just so damn awesome ! The concept itself ain't something totally new, but the actors play there character just so well you really feel for them, care for them and want to see them grow together. The movie is just paced well enough to be a good balance between an adult comedy and a teen comedy, sometimes you can laugh at the silly joke, other time you can really relate to what those guys are going trough even tough the situation itself is something that is hardly possible. Its hard to explain with words really, but this movie is really among my top 10 movies of 2013 and probably in my top 3 comedies of 2013 as well. I would highly recommend it.",9,0,1,7 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," What did i just watched? Oh Boy !!!
","Now don't get me wrong, the Peter Parker/Spider-man and Gwen Stacy characters are done fine. Even Electro is OK as a villain. But what they did with the rest??? They spend all the movie build the Green Goblin for what? 3 minutes of screen time? WTF. I already heard the Rhyno was more or less just a cameo.. And 'poop' yeah he was... not even a complete battle wow... But Green Goblin appear on screen for a couple minutes, thats it... he is so lame... I was so disappointed when i saw this...Yes yes, maybe they want to keep him for a sequel... maybe. And yes they did show the tentacles and all.. so there still lots of potential for this series. But really the way Harry Osbourn aka Green Goblin(by the way he is never called that) is handled is crap... plain and simple.Of course when there was a pretty good trilogy before you tend to compare... and compared to the first trilogy so far this one ain't winning... 2 vs 2 is superior to the first trilogy easily...Its just... you don't relay the Goblin to a second zone 'poopy' villain... hell even Harry as the Goblin in Spider-Man 3 had more of a role and a better story... !!! I feel they try to 'dark knight' this series too much and they can't even match Nolan's work... not remotely...So yeah some stuff was entertaining, and Andrew Garfield do a good job as Spider-Man... but the rest feel just SOOO OFFFPS : Yes i used 'poop' because for some strange reason the board don't let me post the real word.",6,0,3,29 August 2014
Logan," Logan does not exist for me...
","What do i mean by this? Well i refuse that the 'Xmen Saga' end up on such a depressing note. Wolverine has always been the best part of the Xmen movies, and yet every attempt they made to make a solo movie felt flat. As much as it hurt me to say it, i feel Origins is probably the best of the 3, even with the insult to Deadpool... At least it was dumb fun... But The Wolverine was over complex for nothing and just bored me, and this one although not boring me per say felt so depressing and dull in atmosphere with such a bad story that i want to whip it out of my memory.I am giving it a 5 because the movie does have quality. The acting is very good from everybody, the landscape and cinematography is great, the brutal action sequences are extremely good, finally seeing Wolverine brutally decapitate and slash peoples is very nice.Yet the story is just so bad... Basically they tell you almost every mutants died because they poisoned the food... and Charles pretty much killed all the Xmen in one of his seizure moments. So it mean everything they accomplished during the years was almost for nothing... As much as i didn't liked that much Days of Futur past and tough it really changed too much, at least the end make it feel right by the franchise and give overall a happy ending, even retconing the deaths that happened in Last Stand.I could go on and make a rant about how the story was changed so much during the years that it created tons of plot holes, especially with Charles in Last Stand and his return later on, but i prefer to focus on Logan and don't go too much all over the place. I just feel that there way of whipping out the Mutants was very weak, and the reasons for Wolverine to loose regeneration once again(was it not the theme of 'The Wolverine'?) just didn't do it for me. Even without regeneration, is he not supposed to still have the Adamantium Skeleton? So why does a Tree manage to impale him? And the whole Adamantium bullet, from Origins to this change too much.The clone villain really felt uninspired and flat and although Donald the henchman guy was presented as an important character and having 'enchancements' in the end he and his men only served as claw fodder and did nothing much.I am gonna stop there as i feel i could rant all day.",5,7,15,23 May 2017
A Clockwork Orange," No Nostalgia Google , first viewing in 2019
","I stumbled across this movie and i heard so much on how a masterpiece it was, so i bough it for around 4$ along The Shining as well, wich i still have to watch. I was going totally blind, no nostalgia googles from me as its not a film i watched as a kid or anything. First viewing in 2019, almost 50 years after it was made and i am 33 years old.To be honest, i kinda like some part of it, i think the message it tell is strong, and i apreciated the 'tour de force' that the movie still manage to make us 'care' for a guy that did horrible things. I enjoyed the general story of it.That being said, oh my gosh this movie is long... There is so much part i felt i could had trim that wouldn't had impact the story. There is a bunch of scene where we have to watch every single little things one after the other. Maybe i am too used of modern cinema where those are shortened but still... There is also a bunch of things that kinda pull me out a bit of the movie, the way some characters talk and felt like caricature almost. Also some stuff that didn't made much sense even for the 70s.I dunno, maybe its because i watched the movie while it was almost 50 years old, maybe its just not my type of movie in the first place. But in the end i did take a look at how much time there was remaining around 4-5 times, but yet i didn't disliked the movie nor was i totally bored either, so thats why i am gonna slice right in the middle and give it 5/10. Of course it was surely different watching this in the 70s or even the 80s, so i would say my review is only valid for viewers of my age or younger that will watch the movie for the first time in modern times.",5,1,6,29 March 2019
Taken 2," Half of me liked this movie, half of me think its pointless...
","OK, just to make it clear, as an action movie, Taken 2 is still pretty solid, it got everything most fans of the gender will like, car chase, fist fight, gun fight, you name it, its in here. But at the same time... did Taken really needed a sequel? Pretty much, was it hard to just star Liam Neeson into another 'bad ass' action movie instead? This movie felt forced from the start, from the whole father want to avenge his son, even if he kidnap womens to be raped and sold, the whole honour factor seemed forced as hell. And as many as mentioned, the age of the daughter's actress really start to show, its hard to make her pass like a teen again, and even Liam himself, kinda looked older in it from many different angles.But on an action point of view, the movie deliver. It got everything a fan of action movies is expecting, and as the movie ended, i was like 'wait wait, is that the end already?' and checked the time left on my DVD to realize yeah... the generic is coming. I guess its a good sign to show the movie is not boring... or maybe it has too much character development at the start... when in the end we already knew those characters...? Its been a while since i saw Taken, i will re watch it soon, but i felt Liam was way more 'bad ass' in the first movie, both in speeches, in action, how angry he was, how brutal he was, he looked way older also in this(still 5 years later) and some fight scene remembered me of some latest Seagal movies... with weird camera angle to cover up the stunt double...Maybe in the end its more or less because Taken was just a nice surprise, a movie i saw in theatre because i wanted to skip school and there was nothing else good on that Friday noon... and it turned out to be awesome. But in any case, a sequel to that movie was just SOOOOOO NOOOOT necessary.But at least it turned out OK and entertaining, but Taken 2 is far from being Taken 1 to me... it ain't as 'bad ass'...and just feel sadly as a cash in sequel... not really bringing much to the first movie.",7,0,0,9 March 2013
The Wolverine," Slow pace... way too slow to me.
","I really liked the X-Men movies, and i am probably among the rare people that think Wolverine Origins was cool and fun. I watched this on my TV tonight after having miss it in theatres and i don't know if its because i got the extended version, but oh was it long...? Logan/Wolverine has been so established previously, and i understand that it need to establish other characters, but the first fight happen around 40 mins... and there ain't that much of them. Jackman is still super fine as Wolverine, but the setting of the movie(Japan) feel kinda weird and the story didn't really catch me at all, i was more or less confuse for a whole part of the movie on who was who and why was he bad or such.Its not that its a bad movie, but i was expecting this to be a fun ride as much as the Xmen Movies in general, but felt somewhat disappointed. Setting this up post Xmen 3 was maybe somewhat of a risky decision and i think it didn't paid too much. Don't get me wrong, the fights that there is are cool, but there too few of them and there was something that felt like this was not the Wolverine i know.Best scene to me was the Magneto/Xavier cameo at the end... which is supposed to set up the next Xmen movie...In any case, not a bad movie at all, but one i felt was ... ordinary and i will really forget quick.",6,0,1,19 November 2013
Lucy," Decent, fun to follow, nothing brilliant tough...
","Honestly the concept is awesome, but the execution... that is probably what left me 'meh'. First of all the drug part at the beginning.. that was hard to get by. I mean if Lucy can seen as a superhero(not really the point of the movie) i feel her 'mutation' happened in a very stupid way. Even in a marvel movie i would had say 'ok... yeah right...' Lucy and Freeman's characters are fine, but the bad guys are just bad caricatures of Asian Gangsters...As for the rest, well the movie did kept me interested, but i felt a bit like in a Nolan movie without the 'Nolanization' as this movie had such a great concept and could had run 2 hours and a half but was super short... Also, its a bit disappointing i had the feeling Lucy was more likable before she got 'juiced', after that she became such a stoic character.In any case this review may seem a bit more on the negative, but actually i had a 'good time' with the movie as it was entertaining and good for a pop corn movie, but it could had been so much more... thats where it hurts. And your lead is Scarlett Johanson... do a lot more with her cmon !! Anyway decent movie, not bad or anything, just not as great as i had hope. Could had use 45 mins more(at least) of run time, with maybe a couple more action sequences as well.",7,0,4,16 January 2015
The Hangover Part III," Weekest of the 3 EASILY...
","I am not one to bash on sequel usually... I actually often like sequels and understand they sometimes are not as good as the original but sometimes even surpass them... and yes i said that.The second movie of this trilogy was funny. Was it as good as the first... hard to say, as the first was very cool, in any case i enjoyed them both...I watched part 3 tonight as i was awaiting the DVD release, having missed it in theatre, funny enough just like Part 2...But oh well... since i watch it at home and all i can watch it with alcohol, take breaks when i want and all yeah right? Well... even with alcohol this was a huge disappointment...As a movie itself its not bad... its OK... but oh damn its SOOO not as funny as the 2 other movies. And even tough the hangover scenario would had look dumb a bit maybe(yeah, can lightning strike 3 times) they actually decided to include it as a post credit scene actually... and it end up being one of the best scene of the movie...I mean, really overall the movie is not bad at all, its just damn the feeling of the 2 previous movies seem to have completely vanish, not only the 'wolfpack' ain't on a hangover, but they decided to make Alan a damn huge DOUCHEBAG and this... sadly ain't working at all. I miss idiot Alan who was retarded maybe, but funny and lovable. The only time we can feel something for this character is when he meet the young baby we saw in the first movie. All the rest just make you want to give him the bitch slap he deserve...Overall Phil was OK, Chow was nicely done(even tough its weird a secondary character from the first movie stole the show), Stew was erased pretty much... and Alan was just a jerk in this...Overall just a big disappointment for a conclusion to an otherwise good series... I emphasized on 'not that bad' as people would say... but oh damn disappointing considered what it could had been.And yes... i missed Mike Tyson... weirdly i tough it would had been cool to see him again in this...For some reasons i think it would had been hilarious if he was the guy that bough Chow's 'mexico's mansion's instead of the Marshall bad guy...",6,0,1,1 October 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," This is how you film an action movie !
","John Wick is one of my favourite recent years action movie and the second one pick up right where the first one left. The action is sharp, well filmed, no bad shaky cams and jump cuts like a certain bad action movie i saw recently. Its so refreshing to see everything and admire the practical stunt work.Its a fantasy world and its true that at time you have to suspend your disbelieves but that world is well crafted for you to get into it.I would say the first one was maybe slightly better story wise but this one has more actions and in a good way, and i still was very interested in the story anyway.So far the best movie i seen in 2017, this movie really deserve to be supported in theatre. Reeves does not show a glimpse of his true age.",9,29,57,12 February 2017
