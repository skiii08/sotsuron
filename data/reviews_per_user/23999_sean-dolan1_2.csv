Skyfall," Skyfall
","It takes so much to label anything as 'the best ever'. And sure, the term is thrown around way too much. But sometimes, it can be used with the best intentions; not necessarily making a big deal out of it. What I'm about to say is backed up by hours of contemplation. 'Is this the best Bond film ever?' I would ask myself. It came down between From Russia With Love and Skyfall. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to stone me, agree with me, praise me, or what have you for saying this, just hear me out. Skyfall is the best Bond movie of all time. Period.I'm the first person to love a classic Bond movie. I've seen every single one multiple times and without a doubt they are some of my favorite films. I'm a 007 expertise, and I was beyond excited to see Skyfall. Going into the film, I had heard wonderful things; but I was not expecting to see the best Bond film yet.Skyfall had everything right. It was classic Bond meets future Bond. It was action packed, but still extremely graceful. Craig playing bond was smooth and stylish as hell, and Bardem as Silva was the best villain portrayal since Donald Pleasence as Blofeld. I'm not trying to jump to conclusion; Skyfall was honestly the perfect Bond film. I was more than pleased at everything Skyfall had to offer. The return of Q and Moneypenny was refreshing. Plus the other dozens of twists, surprises, and returns was enough to make a grown man cry tears of joy.Perfection sums up this modern day masterpiece, and I can't wait to see Bond 24. Skyfall will forever live in Bond history as truly one of the best films to date. Bravo Bond. He's back and better than ever.",10,6,17,12 November 2012
The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby
","Although visually deafening and self indulgent, The Great Gatsby succeeds due to Luhrmann's bold vision, homage to the source material, and even another breathtaking performance from Leonardo DiCaprio.The Great Gatsby isn't a film to be taken lightly. It's played out on a grand scale, and there is certainly never a dull moment. It's fast paced, exquisite, and an enormous production. With that said, there are going to be positives and negatives.The Great Gatsby just doesn't have an off button. Luhrmann constantly throws his visionary yet overwhelming world in his viewers faces without ever considering down time. His modernization of the classic tale works in some places; I can't say the music works or doesn't because sometimes the music fits perfectly with the scene while at other times I want to watch the movie on mute. It seems as if Luhrmann wants to plan the best party in history, but only has a small house to do so.On the other hand, The Great Gatsby is pure popcorn entertainment. Never once was I bored, tired, or thinking negatively. I was hooked on the story and I always wanted to know where it was going. I previously mentioned the world Baz creates is indulgent, which it is. But that doesn't prevent it from being bold and creative. Throw in one of DiCaprio's best performance and an ensemble (Tobey Maguire is immensely underrated) worth dying for, and The Great Gatsby turns out to be a film worth watching and maybe even loving. Its flaws just prevent it from being masterful.",9,0,2,29 May 2013
