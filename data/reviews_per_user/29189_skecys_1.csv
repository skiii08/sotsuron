Antz," I think this movie is BETTER than a bugs life.
","I saw both movies, and most reviews of a bugs life state that it surpasses Antz, which i don't get.I think both movies are a bit different and Antz is aimed mostly at adults (like the humor used), while A Bugs Life is a typical children's cartoon style of movie.There are a few things i liked better in Antz.-first the coloring, Antz is stylish, the colors add to each other, while in A Bugs Life everything is so colorful it becomes childish, thats also a reason why children will chose it over Antz. -then there is the acting, i think the movements of the ants in Antz :) are more realistic and human-like then the movements of those is A Bugs Life. -last, Antz's story is a lot more dramatic !
Again, they're both good movies :) but don't think of Antz as just another cartoon, Antz goes deeper.Keep it up Dreamworks !",9,1,1,14 March 2000
