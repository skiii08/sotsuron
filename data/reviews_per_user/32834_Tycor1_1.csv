Miracle," miracle
",The movie miracle is second only to Rudy and rocky. Only because OF THE GREATSTORYLINE. As a goalie i love this movie because of Jim Craig's story.I am currently trying to raise my game to the next level.Though the music wasn't to good besides dream Weaver. this movie is the 3rd best sports movie ever. thats what hockey is all about. THE DETERMINATION WAS GREAT TO.THE quote the 'legs feed the wolf was great'.Plus it was cool to see Schneider play his dad and them in Boston to play Harvard in my hometown.Plus it was weired to see a goalie not wearing Vaughn velocity but cooper witch does not make hockey anymore.But THE BEST PART WAS TO SEE Jim Craig looking for his dad after they won. Its a goalie thing.This movie CAPTIVATES A UNDER DOG AND KNOWING YOUR PROBABLY LOSE BUT LEAVE EVERY THING ON THE ICE. ITS NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IN THE FIGHT BUT THE SIZE OF FIGHT IN THE DOG. THE ONE THING YOU NEED IS HEART AND THE WILLINGNESS TO GIVE 110% AND THIS MOVIE HAS BOTH OF THAT.,10,1,2,22 October 2005
