The Mask," Funny, nice effects : that's enough !
","A sympathic loser (Jim Carrey) discovers a mask which will allow him to do what he wants, revealing his personnality. The story, after a comics, is ok but this film is not for script analysts ! It's funny, visual effects are really wonderful and a true tribute to Tex Avery. Don't miss the first appearence of the superb Cameron Diaz (she was an Elite model before this movie). The jazzy soundtrack also contributes to keep this movie entertaining, and that's exactly what it is made for.",7,0,0,10 May 2000
Finding Nemo," Just good (that is: disappointing)
","Finding Nemo is just an average animation movie. Unlike its predecessors, it's aimed only at kids; the plot is very thin. I watched this just a day after Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and Finding Nemo pales by comparison. I find this movie particularily overrated and I would still recommend it for kids.",7,1,1,21 October 2003
Forrest Gump," You're dumb...
","...but the USA can make you rich, healthy and famous with the minimum trouble to make this a pure Hollywood movie. Should I say that this movie, though cast is okay and directing conventional, is much overrated. This movie seems made for a religious and puritan American audience, and it received here in France a particularily mixed opinion. Script has to my mind many flaws, music is irritating, and again I completely disapprove the meaning... so watch it (once only) if you have time and make yourself an opinion but don't think you are going to watch a wonder just because of its 6 academy awards! 6/10",6,7,13,4 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Well done
","I had not read the books, so I can only judge the movie itself. It's technically well done: great cast, effects, and excellent directing. There is a good balance between action scenes and more sentimental scenes. I would just have one comment: this movie is highly 'conventional' and shows no originality. It's one of the 10 best sci-fi ever but I don't think it deserves #1 on imdb. Movies like 7 Samurai, other classics or in totally different styles Pulp fiction or even CTHD have a greater aura than LOTR! Overall 8/10.",7,0,0,25 December 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," One flew over the cuckoo's nest 2
","This movie takes place in a mental hospital, and offers a character study. It's very well acted, and that alone makes this movie enjoyable, since the study is only superficial and in part replaced by some action (Angelina Jolie's flights). The presence of One flew over the cuckoo's nest, definitely the reference, is undeniable: the photography is very close, and sometimes the opposition too visible (men brought in to visit women in Girl, interrupted, the night parties after getting rid of the warder...). Jolie deserves her Academy Award (best supporting role) and this movie can be watched, but could have been better. My suggestion: watch Girl, interrupted and then One flew: you will enjoy the first and acknowledge the second as a masterpiece.",6,2,3,28 April 2001
