The New World," Awful
","I know that probably this won't be added but anyway i just want to express my feelings. I only wanted to see this movie cause Colin Farrel was in it. I watched for 30 min and I ended up all most killing my self( just kidding :P ). The movie sucked mostly because it was shoot I think in someones back garden, the camera doesn't stay still for more than a few seconds ( was the cameraman trying to kill him self too???? ). And the acting, Jesus you can't even call that acting, even O.J. acted more convincing at his trial.P.s. Please be kind with me its my first post here and i promise that i will improve my spelling and do you have like a chat room or something like that?",1,4,12,20 February 2006
