Angels & Demons," Did Da Vinci offend anyone? Let me make it up!
","The whole movie had an apology feel to it. That as if too much was revealed in Da Vinci about the shady past of the religion, that Vatican got in touch with Brown, and that he had to write something showing how good the people of the Vatican are.If you had read any Dan Brown, or seen Da Vinci, you might say Deja Vu, as many themes repeat (following endless clues comes to mind). A girl that's almost useless, and the main character whose outrageous guesses turn out to be correct. The odd technical details, like an antimatter that lingers around for 24 hours (in reality, it disappears in a flash), or that a battery that cannot be charged until it is totally depleted, irritates the viewers.The movie is very predictable, except for the last few bits. I was glad when it was over.",1,16,24,20 July 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Terrible!
","This was clearly the worst movie I have ever paid money to watch. If it was on TV, I might have suffered the first ten minutes and see the lack of acting, the constantly revolving camera around a depressed girl (who remains so throughout the movie), the lifeless dialog and the lack of continuity.The only highlights of the movie were the scenes shot in Italy, which I thought that was better made than the rest of the movie. It actually had dialog and fluidity.Only watch the movie if you are a girl between 12 to 15, even that's stretching it, and wish to see half-naked boys.",1,1,5,21 November 2009
