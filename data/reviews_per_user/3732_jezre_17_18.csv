The Mask," The Best Jim Carey Movie By Far
","I have never been a Jim Carey fan, i have always thought that in his movies he is trying too hard to be funny, acting way over the top, trying to play a cartoon character by himself; for me it doesn't work, but THE MASK is something totally different, because you are watching Jim Carey as a cartoon character, with large teeth and a make up that just by watching him it would make you laugh.Now this character is really a great vehicle for Jim Carrey to make his show, and this times it works more than perfect.This movie made me laugh a lot, and the wonderful thing is that THE MASK is not overused, making his appearances more enjoyable.My Jim Carrey favorite by far.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as enjoyable as the old episodes, but visually hypnotizing
","It is so hard to review this movie because is a 50/50 situation: you could have all the reason to hate it, or to love it. I'll review the movie according to the first time a saw it, and my reaction to it.It was 1999, and I was 14 years old; by the time i was a big fan of the old episodes, and episode 1 became my most anticipated movie to watch.The main theme burst at the beginning, and i find myself humming the melody, i'm really excited; the introduction words mention something about a trade dispute, and I can't understand a single idea of what they are talking about, but a space ship pass the screen roaring powerfully, this is good; young Obi-Wan Kenobi shows up with master Qui-Gon, a really boring conversation starts, once again i don' t understand nothing (what the heck are they talking about), but a light saber battle starts, i'm exciting once again, hypnotized by the visuals and sounds, and the rest of the movie is pretty much the same, some boring plot scenes that apparently don't make ant sense, and suddenly a stunning action sequence that would take your breath away (by the way the boring plot scenes i'm talking about become more clear as you watch episode 2 and 3)But in overall, is an extraordinary experience to see this movie on the big screen; it takes you to another fantasy worlds, that look so real and fantastic, that you wish you would visit them in a galaxy far, far away. 9 out of 10",9,0,1,29 November 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the best action movies of all time
","`Raiders' is by far one of the most entertaining, exciting, and funny movies off all time. The action never stops, since its spectacular introduction until its spine-chilling ending this movie is absolutely one of the best from Steven S.The story is about a professor who is an archeologist and an adventurer as well, who is assigned to find the mystical ark of covenant, which is a relic that apparently contains the power of god, and what better villains than the Nazis for Indiana Jones to fight with.`Raiders' contain everything you could possibly want in a movie: Love, Action, Suspense, comedy, Violence, snakes, fights, ghosts, traps, guns.The only thing I don't agree with is the PG rate. This movie is by far too violent to be PG (you can see how Indiana SHOTS IN A GUY'S HEAD at two times), the fight scenes are too violent, and for a PG movie there's too much bloodÂ… but who cares everybody have seen this movie hundreds of times, and despite of the violence it's really worth watching.So get ready for the adventure with `Raiders of the Lost Ark'.10/10",10,0,0,28 April 2004
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Inspiring and delightful
","ET really is a touching and inspiring movie. It touches your heart and reminds you about that time when you were just a kid.I have to admit that when I was a kid I had no interest in this movie, even when it was presented on the TV, I always changed the channel; but on the 20th anniversary of the movie, and with 16 years old, I thought: I have to see it.And I wasn't disappointed: the movie is not the most impressive in CGI or sound, but it has something that while you are sitting there watching that grotesque creature you fall in love with it, and man, ET goes and I was crying like one of those ridiculous `sentimental girls', I couldn't believe it.I don't know how Steven S. did it, but with ET he created something that I think I could call: How we could learn to accept and love to each other no matter of the differences of nation, language, or color.And besides the whole sentimental thing, this movie is really entertaining, especially for Drew Barrymore, (I just knew her for Charlie's Angels) she is so adorable and funny.This movie is a real delight, so if you think that you couldn't possibly enjoy a sentimental movie rated PG, shame on you.",9,1,2,28 April 2004
X-Men," A Very Good Introduction, but you do feel that something is missing
","It is a great challenge to make the first episode of a superhero series, why? You have the pressure of making it believable, entertaining, dramatic, exciting, you know what...Bryan Singer, hands down, he is a great director, x-men is a hit, and without the action sequences you would expect from a movie of this kind, he keeps your full attention, but not for long enough.The minutes fly by and suddenly you will find yourself hoping for something exciting to happen, and it will, but by that the movie has reached almost its conclusion.Good thing that there is a sequel, that it works very good thanks to this first act, not a bad thing, right??? 8 out of 10.",8,4,5,30 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Overall: not the best episode, but it is impossible to hate.
","I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,29 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The love story feels forced, the rest is astonishing
","What a ride of a movie. Episode 2 breaks loose a little bit this time and it gives you an amazing ride, mostly. What is so difficult about this movie's character relationship is that those feel forced, like if they knew already as we do that sooner or later they will end up in episodes 4,5,6. You know that Anakin soon or later will get it on with Padme, and the actors know that and we know that, but most of their scenes feel so forced that i find myself laughing at one of the most corning love dialogs in movie history.Fortunately, the love story isn't everything this movie has to offer. Episode 2 brings you some action sequences that surpass the complexity and excitement of episode 1, including an amazing pursuit on Courscant, a chase on asteroid field, an amazing action sequence on a droid factory, and the last and best thing the start of the clone wars.The visuals on this movie are one of the best thing on this episode, they haunt your eyes and never let you go, showing you some new worlds and old ones but from a different perspective. I have to say that this movie feels long on it's running time, it could've been use some editing here and there, that's because since the last action sequence until the clone wars there's a large amount of time, most of it spending on main plot elements, that although necessary to the overall trilogy plot, they about put you to sleep as they are so unexciting; but wait until the climax with Yoda that scene, steals the whole show and it's worth the admission ticket. A very good episode, as good as episode 1, in some ways better, but not as good as the old ones, that's impossible. 9 out of 10.",9,2,2,30 November 2006
"I, Robot"," Very enjoyable.
","I'm not a fan of Will Smith, as a comedian I think he's not that great, but in a straight action role he fits well enough. I' ROBOT, is one of those examples; Will plays a police officer of the future, a future in which robots are as common as humans, and they are apparently harmless; you would suspect from the beginning that something is not going right, as Will Smith character suspects.One would say that the plot is kind of predictable, but not all of it is.There are plenty of surprises, and enough action sequences, with great visual effects to keep the average viewer entertained.And the performing of all the actors is well in the terms of an sci-fi action movie.It is not worth Oscar, but it doesn't need to be; this movie is pure entertainment, and action by the minute. Keep doing stuff like this. 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,6 December 2006
Edward Scissorhands," Dany Elfman score, Tim Burton bizarre visual style, your eyes and ears will be happy
","The story line is very simple, most of the characters don't have a solid reason to behave like they do, the romance between the main characters is completely unbelievable, all of that would be true without Danny Elfman score and Tim Burton visual style.Those 2 elements made it all possible for me; ESH is as magic as fairy tale could be, and you would wish that it'd never end.The acting is by far too cartoonish, but that's what makes the movie a very entertaining and funny experience.Jhonny Dep is perfect in his role, he doesn't talk much, he looks creepy, but still he manages to be tender and kind enough to win you all over.Wynona is absolutely gorgeous (what eyes) and good make up too when she acts as a granny.Now let me say that Danny Elfman Score for this movie is one of my favorite scores of all time, is absolutely haunting and magical, so powerful that corny scenes with his music become historical scenes, that would give you chills on your back and arms, and maybe brought some tears to your eyes. Tim Burton's Best. 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,30 November 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," An extraordinary action film, but could have been better.
","I think that Lost World is fantastic; it has lots of action, great special effects, a wonderful score by John Williams (which is darker than the first movie),great sound effects,but i think that the whole sequence of San Diego has nothing to do with the entire movie. But still a good movie , and a decent production.I'm shocked about find out, that many people think that JP3 is much better.It's impossible that someone could think like that. I was in the movie theater watching it, and it is completely absurd and boring,at least Lost World has a more exciting ending.JP3 ends, and you think: 'That's it?'.Lost World has flaws, but not as many as JP3, so if you want to see a great adventure with a lot of heart pump action see Lost World.",9,7,10,1 April 2004
There's Something About Mary," So Funny, but, Is it really necessary to say the 'f' word so many times?
","Wow, what a good comedy; 'Something about Mary' is going to make you laugh either you want it or not. The jokes are so outrageous that or you're going to chuckle, to laugh, or to crack up as i did almost the whole time.The story is about Ted, a nerdy guy who is in love with the nicest and prettiest girl of the school: Mary. When he luckily gets to go to the prom with Mary, and he's going to pick her up at her house, one of the most hilarious sequence of the movie starts, you'll laugh so hard that you're going to have to see it one more time to catch all the phrases and dialog.But, the sequence ends, and now we are in the present, with Ted still in love with Mary; so he hires by a friend's advise Pat Healy, to spy on her, though he denies that he's a stalker, and then almost every man that gets to know Mary falls for her.But that's not the best this movie has to offer. This is a basic, simple plot to have a lot of explosive funny sequences, and there are a very good amount of good ones.SPOILERS AHEAD:1-The zipper sequence. 2-The dog resurrection sequence. 3-The masturbation scene (wait till you hear the background music and that scene) 4-The gel part. 5-The fight Ted vs. Dog. 6-The reunion of all the creeps who are in love with Mary. 7-And a final murder of a singer.Those are the highligths, but you are certainly going to find a lot more in here.My only personal objection is the 40 f... words; I mean, they could have take out all the f words, and the movie would have been as funny as it is, but is good anyway. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,4 December 2006
Titanic," THE BIGGEST SHIP OF ALL TIME, the weakest acting of all time.
","TITANIC is absolutely a terrific mega production. It's visually perfect, the special effects are terrific, the score from James Cameron is by far unforgettable, the costumes are awesome, the sound effects are spectacular, and the acting is just the opposite. It wasn't a surprise that TITANIC got all the OSCARS but the acting ones.
I have to say that this movie is really clever, because is not all about TITANIC the ship, is about the forbidden love story of Rose De Witt Bukater and Jack Dawson, and how they fall in love in this terrible tragedy.
The love plot is very predictable and while you are seeing it is not much like other James Cameron Productions, besides I found annoying at times the acting between the very hot Kate Winslet and the fake Leonardo DiCaprio. It's not a believable relation, for me it looks false, and being 1:30 seeing this relation developing it's kind of boring. However not all is bad, the characters of Molly Brown, Calvert, Captain Smith, Rose's mother, and even Fabrizzio and Tommy are perfectly performed.The sinking sequence is one of the most incredible and realistic scenes I've ever seen in a movie; it's really impressive what James Cameron and all his crew achieved, it's the best dramatic, thrilling, disturbing and realistic sequence that has ever been made.This movie was really daring, and its PG-13 rate was really criticized, and with absolutely right, because contains brief frontal nudity, (YOU CAN SEE KATE'S BOOBIES, MMMMM), one use of strong language (`..and his f***ing hand, sorry his hand'), some sexuality (`You are trembling.hoo haa') and disturbing disaster situations (Lady holding her son and repeating him: `It'll be over soon', or Tommy being shot by Mr. Murdock).I would've give it an R, but who cares, this movie is going to be remembered as the movie that more money $$$$$$ has earned. 9/10",10,1,4,7 May 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," You can't hate a movie that has been created on purpose to be a brainless entertainment.
","I mean, come onÂ¡Â¡, this movie is so dumb on its plot, so dumb in the action, so dumb on the romance, and the acting too. That's a big message from the creators of this movie to you, seating in front of the screen. It's not to be taken seriously, this is a popcorn movie, it's supposed to be campy and brainless.Now you have to be careful while doing this kind of movie, or you would end up with garbage as 'Lake Placid'.But this is not the case; Doug Liman is a great director, and the fun and excitement that he brings around is noticeable.Now, as for Pitt and Jolie, they are good actors, and you can see through their faces that they are having a good time while doing this movie.I did have a great time watching it, and so the rest of the audience, the trick is to keep your critical mind off; if you do that, you are going to have a great time while seeing Mr and Mrs. Smith. 9 out of 10.",9,2,3,6 December 2006
Jaws," Absolutely terrific and enjoyable
","Jaws is one of the most exciting and suspenseful films of all time. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was really scared almost through the entire movie, even just by hear the famous `shark' music.Everything in this movie is great, since its scary beginning until its awesome conclusion.The acting is one of the best I've seen in an action/terror movie: The characters of Queen, chief Brody, and Hooper are just amazing, particularly Queen, which from my point of view is the best actor in the movie. He goes from serenity to insanity, from funny to despicable, and he just does it in a perfectly kind of way.The shark obviously is not the most real shark I've seen in a movie, but, for a movie from 1975 is reasonable. And it still is more impressive than the computer graphics of many current action movies. The DVD version is by far a must have DVD for those who like this movie, because the soundtrack has been digitally enhanced and the visual quality is by far a lot more better than the original movie.10/10",10,3,7,28 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Way better than 1 and 2 but...
","It was impossible for George Lucas to have something as good as 4 and 5, but still he was close with this one, because Episode 3 goes beyond everybody's expectations.This episode is out of the 6 episodes, the one with more action, and i mean a lot of action, the first 20 minutes are a space battle so big and so filled with visuals and detail and a lot of movement, that is almost impossible to catch every little detail.The action is the kind that makes you cheer and laugh, is a roller coaster ride.Now comes the bad, big plot scenes with more boring dialogs; of course they are necessary, but most of them are the answers the plot holes of the last episodes, so what can you do?Now when Gorge Lucas has every little detail in his history put in its rightful place, now goes straight to business, and what all we've been waiting for finally arrives... SOME SPOILERS ...the turning of Anakin to the dark side...and there are 45 or 50 minutes until the end. Those minutes are the greatest thing that the new trilogy has to offer, it's an amazing conclusion and a wonderful introduction for the old trilogy.You would never see Darth Vader the same way again. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,30 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," Xtraordinary action, 2 times the first one
","We already know the characters, their motivations, their desires, and know in X2 Bryan singer place all the x-men into action. If you think that the first one didn't have enough action, wait till you get a load at this one.The action starts from the opening sequence until the very end, with a very entertaining plot in middle of everything.Wolverine once again takes the lead (though there are mutants with powers cooler than his) and Hugh Jackman fills the role with perfection, so does the rest of the cast in some smaller but nice roles.One has to understand that in the x-men universe there's a lot of characters and the movie can't be too long, so instead of a great story with a background for everybody, we get a plot that uses all the x-men at the time in a very entertaining way.So, if you are looking for a great action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, X2 is just for you. 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,3 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It Would Make You Cheer
","What a ride, this is one of the most entertaining fantasy-sci-fi movies around; it has all you would expect from a movie of this kind and much more: action, suspense, comedy, a little romance, adventure, villains, lightsabers, laser guns, space ships, monsters, aliens, speeders, banthas, droids, death star, DARTH VADER, princess with funny hair do, harrison ford, one of the best John Williams score, Chewbacca, Do I need to say more?No, because this movie is already a classic that has inspired a lot of other movies.It would not make you cry, it would not make you think in deep issues, more better it would make you cheer. Fantastic entertainment. 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,29 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Episode
","This one is as good as episode 4, but in a different kind of way. The adventure is there, the action also, the comedy too, but this time around the plot contains a lot of tragedy, that's a new one, and it leaves you with a nostalgic feeling, because it doesn't have a happy ending.That's what makes this movie the best episode, it introduces the characters you already know and puts them in a real peril; you do care about them. You travel with everyone of them on their journeys, and all of those journeys are fantastic.The acting is way better than the original and the themes far more darker than before.The plot surprises are... well surprising and the fate of the characters is uncertain.What a movie, what an episode, what a story, 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,29 November 2006
