Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A nice wrap up to the chaos of the first one.
","I enjoyed the first one somewhat. Good cast, and Tarentino quirky with over the top villains but a surplus of the red stuff. I went to Vol 2 expecting more of the same and was very surprised. Reduced splatter, plot and actions explained! This really does elevate the total package to near excellence. I could see people who were put off by Vol 1 not seeing 2 at all. That is a real shame, but these were not originally conceived as two separate movies, and the slaughterhouse action of Vol 1, while way too heavy handed, was meant to be tempered by the slower paced exposition of Vol 2. A solid 8 but allow enough time to watch both halves.",8,1,2,5 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pathetic marketing tool for action figures and other movie related promotions
","I would be embarrassed for George Lucas if I did not believe the deficiencies in this film were a result of his greed to sell Star Wars toys to a new generation of consumers.Jar Jar Binks, a child actor who cannot act,a screenplay written over a weekend,and a weak effort to use special effects to hide how bad the movie was.I suppose the Ewoks all those years ago were an indication of what was to come but I had blanked their existence from my consciousness.How much money do you need Mr Lucas?Are you far enough ahead yet to return to movie making in time for Episode 2?If not I boldly predict Episode 3 will be direct to video.",5,0,1,23 June 2001
Memento," A little too clever but still worth a look.(minor spoiler)
",The flashback format was a little awkward at first but it really makes the film. I don't think anyone can find much fault with the performances but at the end of the day how much can you like a film that does not have a single likeable character? The main character's disability seems like some kind of hellish 'Groundhog Day' which is where the film gets to you but it shows too many actions with too little consequences for it to be really believable.,6,1,4,20 May 2001
Inglourious Basterds," Entertaining but not his best
","I am a huge QT fan so went expecting a lot. My short take is that if you want something as fresh as Pulp Fiction or as eye popping as Kill Bill you will be disappointed. This film plods painfully along in the first half, setting up the later story but not in a slick way like his earlier work. It almost stumbles through the usual QT violence (although less gratuitously than you might expect from the trailers) before flowing nicely for the last half hour. It is like the first half of the film was edited by a student. Brad Pitt is a caricature and most of his band of merry men are not very well developed. The villain is maybe the best fleshed out and most interesting. Not to say Pitt isn't good because you want to laugh every time he opens his mouth and he looks like he's having fun. Not bad by any means but QT and Brad Pitt together set the bar pretty high and I don't think they quite reach it. Pitt's Italian dialogue is memorable.",7,3,9,23 August 2009
Captain Marvel," Decent popcorn movie but fails to meet the rising bar.
","The Marvel universe is based on a horde of different characters designed to pique the interests of as many people as possible. The assumption isn't that everyone is following every character, just that people will choose and follow their favorites so the plot overlaps don't dilute the story. On the big screen everyone goes so the plot overlap is 100%. Deadpool and Ant Man step out of the loop and maybe there isn't an infinite niche for other/anti heroes either but they work because they aren't a repetition. I have fished my limit of people in cat suits shooting energy out of their hands. Disney will milk something until they start losing money but we don't have to ride that train with them. Five Marvel movies ago I probably give this one an 8 but today I say just wait to rent it.",6,1,3,16 March 2019
Spider-Man 2," Doc Ock pulls this one out of the fire!
","I don't have much good to say about the first half of this movie. Spider angst, no organizational skills, and no social skills threaten to make Peter Parker into one of the great losers of cinematic history. And then the director beats on that concept like a rented mule. He is almost such a shmuck you don't care whether he succeeds or not, which is probably not the target response for your hero. Huge gaps in logic as Spidey's strength comes and goes but ending in a feat of strength so impressive, you absolutely know Sam Raimi has never read one of the comic books that generated his leading man, nor has he considered how that one feat conflicts with any other physical limitation the character has ever shown. Alfred Molina is a breath of fresh air into what starts out as a pretty silly movie. He steals every scene he is in and to me is as good a supervillain as Jack Nicholson was in the original Batman(high praise, for a smaller part). The movie starts out as a video rental but pulls together so strong at the finish that I have to recommend it, although this one seems more geared to older teens than the single digit fans of the first film.",7,0,1,17 July 2004
Blade," A good rental choice for an action movie
","This is not a vampire movie-It is an action movie where some of the characters are vampires. Except for the bloodbath at the very beginning, an incidental clip where a vampire is gnawing on a woman on a city sidewalk with vehicles driving past, and an almost comical encounter between the heroine and an undead former boyfriend there is no horror in this film. If a sequel is in fact being made I hope those involved with production try to take advantage of what vampires are supposed to be instead of making most of them into generic 'bad guys.' It is certainly decent entertainment and any deficiencies cannot be blamed on the cast-It just had the potential to be so much more without a lot of major changes.",Null,0,1,13 February 2000
Troy," Not nearly so bad as some scathing reviews led my to expect.
","Sure Brad Pitt's British accent(explain again why they all had British accent's?)was terrible. His spoken performance was generally weak, especially compared to Eric Banna and Sean Bean, like the director was afraid to make him reshoot anything. Having seen what he can do with the various 'nutjob' roles he has taken on(Kalifornia, True Romance, 12 Monkeys)it's not like he can't do better. BUT I still really liked the film. Pitt has a surprising physical presence. I was expecting the 165lb Pitt's dispatching of the gigantic Boagrius played by Nathan Jones to look ridiculous, but it worked. Sure they rewrote the story but it was watchable all the way, and the length never bothered me. I enjoyed this at least as much as Gladiator. Maybe reading a bunch of the hacking reviews set me up for a pleasant surprise but this is the type of movie people go to the theatre for. Do NOT miss this one on the big screen.",Null,2,4,16 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Painful
","Not bad except for that hour in the middle:) Too much cryin, not enough dyin. The story just kind of wanders all over the place, like it was written by someone who had never seen what a movie script looks like. Probably the worst superhero movie I have ever seen and I really liked the first two. Too many villains, and Peter Parker's social ineptitude is getting really old. At the end I didn't really care about any of the characters, although the Sandman villain was the most interesting. It will take some real damage control to get people to think Sam Raimi is the genius they said he was after the first two films. Maybe another Evil Dead sequel will make people forget this dog.",4,0,1,20 May 2007
Horrible Bosses," Decent but probably not worthy of the cast.
","Having recently watched Hangover 2 and Bad Teacher with mixed feelings I was actually looking forward to this film. Having watched it, I can't quite see where the strong reviews came from. Not as formulaic as Bad Teacher but not particularly clever. Spacey was just okay, Aniston was better, and Farrell was very good(but too little screen time for his contemptible character). I am not sure if Sudeikis wasn't carrying his weight or if it was the writing but he was easily the most replaceable of the leads. His lines just seemed like another SNL bit. I don't remember Charlie Day from any other work but he definitely injected some life into the film. Not bad for sure, but not something I would recommend you pay theatre prices for unless you go every weekend. Not as bizarre as Hangover or as crazy as Bridesmaids, but a few pretty good laughs.",6,2,4,9 July 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Vast improvement over Episode 1
","This movie works, even with the difficult task of bringing back some interest after the pathetic Episode 1, and of being #2 in a trilogy so it can offer no closure at the end. I am not sure how good teenage Darth Vader is as an actor, but I choose to believe that his stiffness and occasional awkwardness were signs of youth and hints of a flawed personality that would later allow him to become the evil James Earl Jones. I see they could not resist making a large number of the Jedi knights female, I guess to make certain little girls would also buy toy light sabers but it did not have a major impact on the credibility. A DEFINITE MUST SEE, IF ONLY TO GET THE TASTE OF EPISODE 1 OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.",9,0,0,8 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 2nd time around still a very good film
",I saw this one in the theatre for the second time which I have not done since the advent of VHS. As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.,10,2,2,11 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An excellent film but much more so for those who have read the book.
","While I was watching Richard Roeper slag LOTR on his review the other night I tried to figure out why he would do so when nearly every other source(including Roger)loved it. I had yet to see the film so I could only speculate that 1)This is not really part of a trilogy but rather a 1100 page book chopped into three so it totally lacks a satisfactory ending 2)The books are so filled with characters and single chapter adventures that something had to be left out 3)So many million people have read the novel that the director never had full license to render the book into an optimum screenplay for fear of alienating existing fans 4)Richard never read LOTR.I saw the film tonight and I think I was right on at least three counts. I am a huge fan of the books but there is no question that people who are not won't be thrilled about being left hanging for a year to find out what happens next. The books feature many parts that would be considered dead ends from a two hour screenplay point of view but Tolkien's story telling is inobtrusive enough that it requires 400 pages to flesh out the characters so the full deal would have been a 6 hour film instead 3. It is too bad that the man eating willow and the barrow wights had to be chopped out but that will likely be the way of the whole series. This is a unique film adaptation that we are not likely to see again. More than a 10 out of 10 for most Tolkien fans I think, but for those who don't know the books, just some impressive scenes here and there in a very long film that doesn't have any payoff. I scored it a 10 but I can see why Mr Roeper did not.",10,0,0,24 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Shockingly bad.
","The biggest disappointment since Alien 3. Crammed with cryptic existential references that make no sense to anyone who hasn't seen the previous 2 films this movie has zero stand alone value. The main characters have diminished roles and much of the film is eaten up by a huge battle between the good humans and the bad guy sentinels that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. Add to this a twist at the end that appears to be a setup for a fourth episode. The characters are what made the first film, and largely the second, but Revolutions is taken over by CGI effects. I could not wait for it to end. This is some of the worst writing I have seen in a big budget film. The nice the about the Star Wars or Indiana Jones series' was that they were not based on popular novels so each one could be a fairly complete film in itself. The original Matrix was this way but the Wachowskis got sidetracked with Reloaded(still very watchable)and totally lost with Revolutions. I want my $11.00 back.",4,0,0,11 November 2003
Cast Away," Weak but entertaining nonetheless
",The plot was good but I expected a little more Robinson Crusoe and a little less mental illness. This was an excellent performance by Hanks though-as good as Apollo 13 when there was dialogue but for the amount of the film that was dedicated to watching Hanks in near silence the writing wasn't creative enough to show any depth to the character. You liked the Hanks character mostly because of the first five minutes of the film rather than the bulk of it spent on the island. And I know the escape from the island wasn't the climax of the film but they still showed too much in the trailer.,8,0,1,27 January 2001
The Village," Watchable but not scary enough.
","After the silliness of Signs, 'hit em with a baseball bat and a glass of water' this film is a bit of a return to form the director. Unfortunately, that means more buildup and less payoff than ever. I liked it but I have to wonder if a lot of the spookiness was lost on the cutting room  floor. A really strong cast but no meat in any of the roles except for Hurt and Howard. Bryce Howard has inherited her father's disturbed apple pie face and some of his talent. If you think Shyamalan directs horror movies you will be disappointed. If you don't judge it be the standard set by Sixth Sense it is definitely worth a look.",7,0,0,1 August 2004
Cold Mountain," Odd collection of events, performers, and accents
","I liked the film but I was expecting a bit more. Do you suppose it was intentional that most of the key characters were not Americans? Donald Sutherland and Ray Winstone pulled it off but the rest of them did not sound like they were from the same place let alone the south. I saw the movie as a bit of 'the Odyssey' with the romance between the main characters poorly supported but lots of entertaining unconnected episodes for Law's character on his way back home. Of the three lead characters Zellweger's performance stands out to me, but she has done better work. The memorable battle scene made me think of Enemy at the Gates or Saving Private Ryan, but it was fairly brief. Worthwhile viewing but I would recommend The Last Samurai as a far better executed movie.",Null,0,0,4 January 2004
Salt," Aging supermodel wins MMA title
",I would have given it a 6.5 if there was a way to do it but I rounded up. The action scenes were definitely the weak point because it isn't a cartoon like Lara Croft. Angelina is simply too frail and unathletic to be Ms Jason Bourne. It was like watching adult males being tossed around by a 12 year old and she did it for the entire movie. They could have written around the physical scenes better. Aside from that it was a nice bit of cold war suspense and the strong cast did the best that they could. It wasn't utterly predictable and it is not a copy of the Bourne Identity. The role was written for a male lead but they did a nice job in adapting it for a female. I hope it does well enough in the box office to support a sequel because it was a decent popcorn movie.,7,14,30,24 July 2010
The Patriot," Mel Gibson rewrites history again.
",They couldn't find record of any real atrocities in this war so they made some up. The British are impossibly evil but not particularly smart and so must meet their end at the hands of the devastating tomahawk warrior Gibson. BEWARE! This actioneer masquerades as history but makes fast and loose with the facts. Unlike Braveheart we all know the ending and it's not as though they cut corners but even if you did not know the fact from the fiction you would definitely feel the attempt at audience manipulation and for me that killed the movie.,4,1,3,7 September 2000
Van Helsing," Kind of reminded me of LXG.
","This film is huge on special effects and pretty cast members but very light on anything memorable. So much special effects that they became ordinary after a time, and a script that was pretty weak. The story was interesting, but it should have been given what they had to work with. At the end of the day, they managed to make a horror movie with vampires, werewolves, and the Frankenstein monster, and yet not have anything remotely scary in the film. More chills in Harry Potter. Some of the imagery was so spectacular, however, that I have to recommend it be seen in the theatre. If you expect League of Extraordinary Gentlemen rather than Lord of the Rings you probably won't be disappointed.",7,0,0,8 May 2004
Spider-Man," Lightweight version of the original Batman
","Raimi does an excellent job on this film and it helps that Toby Maguire actually looks like a spider. A lot of what worked in Tim Burton's Batman works in this film. The most talented actor in the flick was the villain, and it showed the freak circumstances that created not only Spiderman, but his enemy. This show is definitely more for children than adults as the dronelike cartoon on TV is probably a source of more of the demographic than the comic book and your 5 year old is not going to find it as spooky as the darker Batman series.",6,0,0,8 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," More of the same
",A little disappointing after some of the really good reviews this film got. I saw it a week after Shrek 2 and it pales in comparison. The three main characters are a little older and instead of being impressive child actors they seem little more than average. By the next sequel the two boys will have trouble playing their characters ages. It really had the feel of a Walt Disney TV movie. Kind of a jazzed up Bednobs and Broomsticks. Still the demographic it is aimed at is 13 year olds and it should continue to impress that age group. I would still recommend it for 16 year olds and under but DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE! It is not as good as the first film and you will probably be disappointed if you go in expecting that.,6,0,0,10 June 2004
Resident Evil," Save your money
",A major disappointment to say the least. All a video game movie needs to fulfill it's limited purpose is cool monsters and some good action sequences. So what made them think they could get away with Night of the Living Dead? This crap was okay in 1965 when it was done the first time and not so bad with the various George Romero remakes and sequels but all this is is a bigger budget B flick. Utterly predictable and full of 'startle scare' scenes. This is the other side of 13 Ghosts but with a plausible(for the genre)idea and lousy monsters - 'more brains!'. Maybe okay for the under 15 crowd as they may not have seen the zombies before.,5,0,0,22 March 2002
Quantum of Solace," Unexpectedly weak compared to CR
","I looked forward to this film more than any other this year so maybe my own expectations set me up. From the cacaphonous Jack White theme music through the drudgy first 45 minutes I never got a feel for what the director was trying to do. It felt more lke a straight sequel than a standalone film and may have turned off as many new Bond fans as CR brought in. No issues with Craig, and his female costar was a lot better than I was expecting but looking back it was like an episode of 24, with a slightly more resolved ending. Bad writing or bad directing I am not sure. The fact that he wasn't pronging every woman in sight and remains true to the character established in his first film shows the new Bond is still on the right track but the next flick will be most critical in the franchise. I just can't picture anyone who hadn't seen CR even understanding what was happening in this picture.",6,1,2,16 November 2008
Batman Begins," Batman de-mystified. Not necessarily the tour de force some critics are calling it
","I liked this movie. Christian Bale. as many others will tell you. seems a perfect fit for the role. The supporting cast, while not having a Jack Nicholson, are very impressive and perform as expected. I don't see this film as better than the 1989 version though. Just as Batman is now shown to have more realism and humanity as a fully fleshed out character, so are the villains. Nobody in this film is larger than life, including Bale, and things seem to be pulled away from the comic book roots. The villains are sort of a lukewarm bunch, not poorly acted, but not particularly scary or menacing and when they get their just desserts, they seem a lot more like just criminals than the personification of evil. And for all the menace of the Batman persona I am not sure I recall seeing a drop of blood except in an early scene involving Bruce Wayne prior to Batman. He is 'dark', to be sure, but mostly just knocks out the bad guys or ties them up much like the campy Adam West character. The audience wasn't cheering when the bad guys paid the price, and in fact, nobody seemed to much care. I also found the movie a bit slow to get started, but that might be because I was subconsciously comparing it to Burtons first. I could live with the pace, because the character had to be thoroughly introduced as this will be the first of several new Batman films. BUT to rate better than a 7 with me the bad guys have to actually be EVIL, and Batman has to be willing to want to do more than just arrest people. Michael Keaton was a scarier customer than the new guy, and seemed to me to be truer to the comic book origins.",7,2,4,19 June 2005
28 Days Later...," Overhyped in the extreme
",This film has an indie super 8 look like Blair Witch or Best in Show. It is a decent film on a ten cent budget but it is not a must see in the theatre by any stretch and quite honestly the Hulk was deeper. It is pretty basic post apocalypse stuff-Omega Man without Heston. I don't want to put a negative spin on this movie because I did enjoy it but from the press it was getting I expected something more.,7,0,0,1 July 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Pathetic attempt to capitalize on success of the original!!
",I had forgotten how bad this movie was until I watched it again on video. A B movie with a massive budget but the book it is based on is a stinker in it's own right. Ultra thin plot with absurd gaps in logic(Why yes dinosaurs did hunt by headbutting massive objects over cliffs!)The first one used flawed but not unbelievable science as it's basis but then Crighton writes a sequel and forgets to let his smarter friends proofread it.,Null,0,0,26 October 2000
Drive," Didn't get it
","I kind of think they wanted a little bit of Transporter, maybe a bit more of The Professional. What I saw was a main character that spoke so little he seemed mentally handicapped at times (no exaggeration). The driving aspect was shot to minimize the 'car chase' theme but in so doing they took an element of excitement away. Good that they stayed away from Gone in 60 Seconds corn, but they didn't have to go quite that far. He hardly speaks to the love interest, so her interest in himis almost confusing. Anyways. not a bad film but this has to be Goslings most wooden performance yet although he didn't write it so I am not blaming him.",6,3,9,17 September 2011
Mulholland Drive," Not Lost Highway but still a dog.
","From previous Lynch experiences I learned to rent him rather than buy him although after the ridiculous Lost Highway it was iffy as to whether I would see this one at all. There are a lot of very interesting elements in this film but I did not buy the package. There are a couple of scenes which clearly have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY and while one can speculate as to the artistic reason for their inclusion a canvas of the several hundred reviews on this site will show they remained unexplained. This film can best be described as a deliberate attempt to confuse and I cannot recommend to anyone that they spend the money to see it. Why not simply walk out halfway through the next film you go to and then guess what the rest of the movie was about? This one, like most of his work, was for the entertainment of David Lynch rather than you.",4,0,2,16 June 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Monty Python and the Holy Grail revisited
","Holy crap, I've never seen so much blood! Not even in Blade when it was pumped through a sprinkler system. It should have been entitled 'Uma and the arteries,' It actually distracts a viewer from the rest of the movie, which might be a plus because there isn't much substance. Alas, since I have seem part one I will also watch the sequel but under protest. More meat and less hemoglobin please.",6,0,2,13 October 2003
From Hell," A decent effort with a weak script.
",I had high hopes for this film. I very much enjoyed Sleepy Hollow and Murder By Decree so this one looked like a lock. Depp's bleak protagonist and his sidekick Coltrane worked well but could not rise above the material. A few breaths of the real London of the time-the dosshouse where the women slept against a rope and the Ten Bells tavern(still around today almost as it was then)but the conspiracy angle was handled better in Murder By Decree. I am not saying wait for the rental but most will agree this film was not all it could have been.,7,0,1,31 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Surprisingly good.
","One of the better childrens movies I have seen, especially since I found the books themselves about as deep as a comic book. Indeed one parent commented to me that it took her child more time to watch the film then to read the book. The sparse and simple dialogue of the books translates well into a script but the real strength of this movie is special effects to rival a Spielberg film and three excellent child actors. I could not however recommend to an adult to run out and spend their 12 dollars on this unless they are bringing a child. This is a detuned Indiana Jones for 10 year olds rather than a film like Shrek that works on two levels. Not really suitable for younger children.",6,0,1,25 November 2001
The Terminal," Pretty average stuff for Hanks and Spielberg
",I was having doubts about whether this film was must see in the theatre or if it could wait for the rental. I assumed incorrectly that it would be more than a smarmy romance comedy because of Spielberg's involvement. You could have plugged Billy Crystal into the Tom Hanks role and not missed a beat. Lightweight stuff. I emjoyed it a little more the Lady Killers but but I wish I had waited for the video. Just a paycheck for Hanks.,6,0,1,19 June 2004
Heat," Outstanding cops and robbers action!
",Too long by 30 minutes but still a must see as long as you don't mind gunfire-At points this resembles a Schwarzenegger movie! The shootout between the police and the gang is incredible. Pacino shows his usual one inch of range-you will swear you have seen his exact character in at least ten other movies-and you have-but he fits the part. The rest of the cast is very solid with De Niro the hood stealing the show. Like most of Michael Mann's better stuff this belongs in a theatre but if not at least find surround sound and a big screen to see it.,Null,0,0,5 March 2000
The Thin Red Line," NOT A WAR MOVIE
","This is an art film, not a war movie. It is a bunch of fascinating vignettes that are not really connected and the director made little effort to try to tie the characters or the situations together. There was a strong enough physical resemblance amongst some of the characters, especially with dirty fatigues and helmets on, that one has difficulty following which character is which.This really could have been developed into several good movies as the stories within the story had stand alone merit and the cast was impressive.The lack of cohesiveness in the various story- lines-unless you count the tired 'madness of war' angle is what kept the individual subplots from being collectively impressive and is why this film died at the box office.The impressive parts make me want to see more from this director but the weak whole does not let me recommend it.",Null,0,0,11 March 2000
Sin City," Stunning violence. Cartoons brought to life.
",I don't know what I expected but this movie blew me away. Bruce Willis was excellent and he was the fourth best actor in the film. Other worldly is how I would describe it. What the movies Darkman and Spawn aspired to. It would have been a 10 for me but the Bruce Willis segment was a bit weaker and a bit more predictable. Graphic violence but softened to the senses by the black and white. The prosthetic makeup twists the features of some familiar faces into the cartoon characters they want us to see. Memorable and unique but a lot of splatter. It was a good enough film that I would see the sequel in a heartbeat but so different from everything else out there that it would be a shame not to just leave it as the one of a kind film that it is.,9,0,0,13 April 2005
Braveheart," Top notch theatre entertainment
",This is definitely best seen on the big screen and I recommend it as a must see for fans of action and romance who enjoy history. The one caveat might be the amount that history was rewritten to fit the story. When I first saw the film I was quite disappointed with the manipulation of historical fact as the lives of many of the key characters have been recorded in some detail and do not fit the Braveheart storyline at all. This is however not meant to be a historical documentary and having now seen the film four times I find the factual inaccuracies don't matter much anymore. The film is an epic period piece of a type not made much anymore and it compares well against any of it's predecessors. I hope Gibson takes another turn at this type of film but he may have set the standard too high.,Null,0,0,13 February 2000
The Bourne Supremacy," Really quite good, despite some Blair Witch camera work
","I have not read the books and thought the first movie in this series was better than average, but nothing special. This one is a lot stronger, and is a stand alone effort that does not require you even see the first film. There are some combat and car chase scenes that have kind of a jerky, piecemeal affect that makes them harder to follow than they should be, but that is the only weak spot in the whole film. I am still having trouble with Matt Damon as a deadly assassin but he is a heavyweight actor and his situation grabs you and holds you through to the last scene. Very good supporting work from Brian Cox and Joan Allen. I believe there was a trilogy of books by this author, and if so I can't wait for the next one.",7,0,1,26 July 2004
The Simpsons Movie," Just a stretched out episode
","And not a particularly good one. The animation was better and there was some of the usual humor but it really had no more laughs than most of the episodes. I can't imagine it that it would have taken them any longer than two weeks to write it. Most of the funnier moments have already been shown in the trailers. This is one of my favorite TV shows but as a movie it left me looking for more. It isn't as though they have to surpass the series with some kind of masterpiece, but any fan of the TV show will be hard pressed to say they don't recall several episodes that were funnier than this movie. They did nothing different except to extend the scenes a bit more than the TV show. I recommend you wait and RENT IT!",6,1,4,3 August 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The best laughs are in the trailers.
","Seriously, some of the jokes in the trailers do not appear in the film. I still enjoyed it but the early hype had this as more than it turned out to be. Ferrell is his funny self, but much of the film is a long SNL skit. A bit of the warmth and the over the top silliness that Ferrell fans watch him for, and a total waste of John C. Reilly's talents. It probably would have been funnier if they had left the French race car driver as a total villainous stereotype rather than showing bits of good character and reasonableness. An good video rental when the time comes, but there are better comedies to see in the theatre right now.",6,2,4,13 August 2006
