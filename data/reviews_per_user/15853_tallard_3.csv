The New World," Same level of sensitivity as a Jean-Claude Van Damme
","This film was not my worst ever, but nearly. Historical dramas are I could say my favorite genre. I grew up in a very small town right next to a 'native reserve' from which I counted a couple of my best friends. I've always had empathy for the Americas original inhabitants and am always interested in how they are portrayed in movies (which is usually disappointing, but I keep trying) so this was my frame of mind when I paid for this movie at Regal Cinemas. Within approximately 45 minutes, my disappointment had already started.I think most nature lovers agree, when the sun's rays shine through leaves, it is a beautiful sight, and running through tall grasses can certainly have an appeal, but in this movie, these 2 images fill nearly a third of screen time. Followed closely by images of the 2 non-lovers staring into each others eyes or His hands groping at Her (she's a child!!!) By the middle of the movie, the endless slow motion clips of the sun's rays and swaying grasses were reminding me of a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. That's exactly his gimmick: take a severely lacking script and dress it up with endless slow motion shots of sunsets and nature. Don't get me wrong I am a sucker for cinematographic portrayals of nature, but one can't repeat the same shot over and over and over again. Take March of the Penguins, nature shooting at it's finest.An hour and a half into this film, I can't even use the word movie anymore, I'm thinking, when is the story going to begin! I have learned absolutely nothing about this period in history, people's thoughts. All we know is the 'naturals' are flip-flopping between bringing gifts or warring with the colonialists, and Pocahontas's narration can probably fit into one page with large print. She repeats the same things over and over again, which only served to make the Indians seem really lacking in intelligence. Actually, that is also a sentiment that came over me, this movie completely lacks respect for Native American culture. It unfortunately made them seem like simple minded grunting beasts. Outrageous.I never walk out of a movie. Movies are my favorite pass-time and I will sit through most anything. However I do sometimes fall asleep (maybe 8 times in total, out of 4 shows a week for a quarter century) and I didn't in this one, but many other patrons did fall asleep.And then oh surprise, Christian Bale came on screen (I didn't know he was in this), and I thought 'finally, maybe we'll get some resolution' but no, nothing new (nor in the story nor in the acting) came of his presence. In my opinion, Christian and Collin both have strong acting skills, but they absolutely require strong direction because otherwise they both come off as very wooden.By the end, I was so disappointed. Mind you, my expectations were not that high, as I've only ever liked 2 each of Collin's and Christian's movies (The recruit, At home at the end of the world, The mechanic, Batman begins). But when I have low expectations, usually a movie will leave me not completely dissatisfied. Not the case here, this movie will not go down in history as anything. It will be forgotten and the story of Pocahontas remains untold.",1,3,12,21 January 2006
BlacKkKlansman," Terribly dissappointed at film and annoyed at marketing
","I've generally liked Spike Lee films over the years. I had high expectations or this one, given the awards. 
Many negative reviews have already covered issues of pacing and writing and editing, which I generally agree with. As a person who's been an anti-racism activist my entire life, I felt this film was heavy handed and propagandist. If a woke person can feel this is heavy handed, imagine how those not on board with the topic can be totally feel propagandised, how futile is it in regards to effectiveness at creating social change?
On the point of marketing, speaking points, and the ridiculous opening line about being based on a true story. So many reviews here state their amazement and how impressed they are at a Jewish person and a black person working together like this. This is a lie, there is no Jewish partner in the book, it is completely fictionalised. Furthermore, confounding race issues with religious issues is truly a non starter. 
But most of the film is fictionalised. The majority of the book is about his undercover work AGAINST black activists, which he spent over three years on.
Given the actual facts as laid out in the book, this film really goes down in ratings. The false marketing is the saddest statement about our society. When people are more interested in virtue-signalling than the truth. 
Had the production values been better, at least it might have been enjoyable as a stand alone, without the pretence of being based on the book, but I kept falling asleep, idiot conversations droned on endlessly and completely took me out of the film. So it's a fail both on production values and TRUTH.
The high rating says a lot about how important virtue-signalling has become in our society.",5,438,744,12 September 2018
Grindhouse," 2 movies, 2 ratings, spoiler in last paragraph
","Rodriguez's feature I rate 4 --- Tarantino's feature I rate 8Rodriguez finds gore amusing, unfortunately the feature had no story to tell, the actors are completely non-compelling, the action was below average, and the storyline had absolutely nothing original. I preferred his first works over his later works. The feature reminded me in many ways of From Dusk til Dawn, which is one of my worst movies ever.Tarantino's great talent is to portray violent death with artistry and originality. He does not fail in this aspect here. However the entire first half of his feature lacked interest. Russel's character is not really explored and the stars of the feature only come into play in the second half of the feature. The result is we get to to know a set of characters, who are artfully killed off, and then they're gone. Then the stars come into the story, and from then on the feature gets much more active and interesting, however coming too quickly to an beautiful boiling point ending which really rocks!",6,1,4,15 April 2007
