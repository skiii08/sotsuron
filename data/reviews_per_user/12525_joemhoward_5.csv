First Man," It is a portrait of a man haunted by death...
","And this is what colours him for the rest of his life. It captures the reclusive but loyal Armstrong, doing the white House gig but not being very good at it. It shows the niggly but never overly close relationship he had with Aldrin. It shows real noments of family heartbreak and the mundanity of the lives of the astronaut wife. It's never syrupy, though the controversial bracelet scene is a pure stab at your heartPeople came into this movie with preconceptions of what should be on screen. We got a sort-of biographical movie about a man who wanted to complete his mission and who was never happy in the spotlight, with a troubled heartbreaking family past and a troubled family present. This was never about jingoism, nor not even about heroism. It was about the nuts and bolts of life and how we cope it situations. I personally loved this movie. It portrayed Armstrong at the most dramatic moments of his life, and tied them back to the most debilitating, heartbreaking one of all.But I guess, some of you don't get that",8,1,3,11 November 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," It's a fun film not a philosophy lecture!!
","This is simply a fun movie with great action sequences, a decent script and good characters. Yes, if you look too hard you'll find flaws but this is fairly irrelevant if you are not learned in the Trek Universe. That being said I am a fan of the films and this the best by miles. , and so much better than any oh the Next Generation movies. Why would anyone grumble over the Enterprise underwater? This is entertainment but its not Michael Bay thankfully. It makes sense! Do yourself a favor and join the ride and another thing, the 3D for once is stunning! Honestly, some people seem to think Star Trek should be some Dalai Llama- esque meditation on life. Quite frankly, it has more going for it than most. Even with Damon Lindenof on board!",8,3,7,31 May 2013
Interstellar," It blew my mind...
","You know, its been a couple of months and I am literally frothing at the mouth waiting for the blu-ray release of this movie, but I am literally flabbergasted at the range of reviews, some of which seem so superior, it seems having an encyclopaedic knowledge of science is what makes a movie good or bad. Someone even said that if you loved 2001, you'd hate this movie. 2001 is one of my favourite movies of all time, but Interstellar is up there, it certainly has more heart than 2001, but really they are different stories with different outcomes. Another reviewer pointed out that the movie 'Contact' was inspiration for Interstellar. I love Contact. Seeing it on the big screen was stupendous. But Interstellar in IMAX trumped it. I don't know what people want anymore. This film had heart, a great story, good acting, spectacular visuals.... It was complex, at least to me it was, and I have no guilt admitting that. My gift is art, not astro-physics or film making, and looking at this film was pure entertainment and a work of art. The Docking scene... the scene so many people seem to go on and on about, is far and away the most exciting few minutes of cinema I've ever seen. The audience actually clapped at the climax of that scene, and Hans Zimmer's understated but gigantic score really unlined the tension. Of course, some would argue that film music shouldn't do this, that Kubrick used silence, that Hitchcock did this or that. I disagree. What is film music for then? Is it a throwaway thing that should be in the background. I don't think so. It made this scene. It was a wonderful partner to the movie itself.Anyway, there is no accounting for taste, else none of us would be here writing reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion... and that was mine",10,1,8,4 March 2015
Foxcatcher," Mehhh....
","I had only just finished the book 'Foxcather' before seeing the film, and really, the movie simply flows along as neatly and precisely as the book does, that is to say, slowly. The central story really doesn't kick in until nearly half way through the book where we deal with Mark Schultz' early life and career and his jealousy of his brother's success. This has all turned around by the time you get to John Du Pont, just not in the rewarding sense that Mark justifiably deserves. He is drawn to Du Pont out of a sense of respect for himself and the need to move on. Steve Carell does a great job of mimicking Du Pont, but there is not a lot of meat there to tuck into. Du Pont's back story is rather well written in the book, but I feel that the movie simply centered on his 'NEED' to feel loved by his rather clichéd mother figure. There is a lot more to it than that, such as his own attempts at becoming a star in various sports, by contracting the best coaches in whatever sport he tried. In the end, the film really doesn't get to the nitty gritty of why he did what he did, it only hints at matriarchal concerns and a need to be liked, which isn't the whole story. There is a lot of subtlety in this film however, and the director should be praised for sticking rigidly to his source material, and not presenting the two brother wrestlers as All-American Heroes. Mark isn't a particularly likable character, but after reading the book, it's a fairly accurate portrayal by Channing Tatum. Mark Ruffalos character is less to the fore, but portrays his brotherly love and slight superiority well. The problem is, this doesn't necessarily make it the most interesting of movies, and doesn't spell it out for the blockbuster jaded film-goer. 2001 was a great 'slow-movie', Foxcather just drags along, almost metaphorically mirroring the life of the Mark Schuitz.",6,3,6,27 March 2015
WALL·E," Masterful, intelligent and yes..a little preachy
","I can understand some people's dislike for Wall-E. Yes, it could be construed as 'preachy', but isn't all art with a message a little like that? When it comes to the environment, it is hard not to come across as preachy. However, that is just one facet of this truly magnificent film. Pixar really outdid themselves with the detail and beauty of the animation. The story is simple enough, and Andrew Stanton homages everything from 2001 to Star Wars in his movie, but in reality, Wall-E just kicks along beautifully. Its almost a silent film with beautifully dramatic and touching moments. It also puts across an apocalyptic message which for me, worked wonderfully, but as I said above, is preachy if you couldn't care less. And the love story at the heart of the film is as touching and moving as any I've seen and along with UP, Pixar have managed to outdo virtually any movie I can think of when it comes to romance.If you haven't seem Wall-E, do not hesitate any longer...",10,1,2,3 March 2013
