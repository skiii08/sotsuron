Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The series has just got worse and worse!
","Just a short review, I watched this film for the first time last week and was thoroughly disappointed, (not that I expected much), the characters were weak and many of the action scenes are straight out of the other three films. Jack Sparrow's character, although amusing at times, has by now been well and truly worn out and he interacts poorly with a host of other new characters that have been thrown into the mix, (amongst some old ones).The story is also poor and in no way links in with any of the other movies so by the end of the film I was both bored and confused. I wouldn't recommend it to any who haven't seen the previous films although I suppose it's worth seeing for a laugh... or two.",3,1,1,5 January 2012
