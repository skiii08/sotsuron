First Man," Not as good as I'd hoped
","With a subject like the Cold War-era space program as a starting point, First Man has a lot of promise. When it focuses on literally the first person to set foot on the moon, the possibilities are even greater.Maybe that's why I feel let down by this. There's plenty of dramatic tension between characters, but it didn't seem to have the right mix of character, plot and emotion in the best places to put it over the top.One big minus for me was the pacing. Despite paying close attention, my wife and I were asking one another who characters were, how they related to one another, etc. And since several years pass throughout the film, some characters change (e.g., a woman is pregnant in one scene, and isn't pregnant a few scenes later). This can be disorienting sometimes, and threw me out of the stories out of the story several times. This drops the rating significantly for me.",7,0,0,27 January 2019
Star Trek," One of the best of the decade
","Let me start by saying that I have not always liked Star Trek. My wife converted me only a few months ago, but even before that, I had wanted to see this movie.The anticipation wasn't in vain. Everything about this film from the opening sequences to the end grab you by the Starfleet shirt collar and pulls you in. The camera and special effects make it intense, while the plot makes it fast paced and absorbing.One of the truly great things about this film is the acting, and the actors. The actors look, sound and act like the original actors, making it feel like you're not watching William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy, but that you're watching Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. The acting is simply great.One thing I worried about going into the movie was that they would try to make it too nostalgic. Try to make it too old-school. They didn't. However, they didn't update it too much either. That is one of the most amazing things, one that you will be talking about when you are leaving. Classic lines are used, but not over-used.This film is Star Trek, so die-hard fans will be giddy with excitement. Less hardcore fans will be enthralled, and there will certainly be folks that will be seeing it, because it is simply an incredible movie.",10,2,13,8 May 2009
Aquaman," A Comic Book on a Screen
","It's over-the-top. It's full of superhero movie tropes. Because it's a comic-bookey movie brought to life about one of the most over-the-top superheroes out there. And I'm sure that's exactly what the creators were trying for, which is why it gets a perfect 10.To be clear: Aquaman has been my favorite superhero since I was a teenager. When I heard about this movie, I was both excited and nervous--WB has a bit of a shaky reputation when it comes to DC movies (late '90s Batman, Green Lantern, etc.). So I don't think my worries were unfounded.From the outset, I was sucked in. Visuals are great (lots of CGI, but a lot of things happen underwater. What do you expect?), and acting is solid. Although there are some disagreements with some versions of Arthur Curry's backstory, this brings a good flavor to the canon (curry? Flavor? Pun very much intended).Takeaway points: visuals are great, story is interesting and moves along at a good pace. Editing keeps things feeling natural and acting helps characters come to life. Very high score is very deserved, even if Aquaman isn't your drink of choice.",10,3,5,2 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Best of the sequels, better than all prequels.
","I'm going to say it. It's the best numbered episode of Star Wars since 1983. The Rise of Skywalker aims a superlaser at the prequel trilogy and blows it six days from Alderaan. Episodes VII and VIII stand no chance.Don't get me wrong, there are a few aspects that seem a little... I guess lazy isn't the word. Overly convenient. They're easy to spot, but can be easily forgiven from a story standpoint, and from a filmmaking standpoint. Plus, it's space opera. You're not supposed to worry about that kind of thing.When all is said and done, TRoS is a great addition/finale to the Skywalker saga, and one I'll be coming back to for a long time.The Force will be with us. Always.",9,3,13,20 December 2019
