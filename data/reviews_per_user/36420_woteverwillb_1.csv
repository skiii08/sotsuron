The Monuments Men," Live action team America - f**k yeah
","Spoiler alertc'mon... did this really happen ?? America comes to the rescue as per usual??!Saving works of art from the greedy Russians and the sadistic Nazis. They start with 5 Americans, a Frenchman and an English gent. Guess what.... the Frenchman and foolish Englishman die and the 5 Yanks save the art - well most of it anyway.the acting is as you would expect from such Hollywood big shots, the script lacks any punch and the bias 'true' storyline winds any non American up! I give it a generous 5 out of 10 Â£12 to see at the cinema left me feeling a little robbed - wait for DVD release folks",5,2,3,22 February 2014
