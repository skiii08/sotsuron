Come and See," Raw and brutal.
",Brutal and raw depiction of WWII in the eyes of a Belarusian kid. Which is not a normal viewpoint we see in American films about the war. Usage of dead on face shots was excellent as it showed the pure state of emotions the characters were experiencing. You couldn't look away and neither could they. The use of the steadicam is also amazing. Which I didn't know was available in 1985. Excellent war film that will leave you shaken to the core.,10,0,0,7 April 2020
Marriage Story," All The Space...
","Tour de force of emotion. Very funny and very sad. The performances are excellent and felt authentic. Makes me very happy I've never been married. Also, lawyers suck.",9,1,1,18 April 2020
