Kill Bill: Vol. 2," shoulda been called 'The tragedy of Bill' Spoiler warning
","This Comment has an ending spoiler so please do not read it if you have not seen the movie. I have to say that the action (or should I say Gore and Violence in Kill Bill Vol.1) kept my attention through out. no.2 was interesting and I think that's as far as i can go in terms of being glowing or superlative about the film. Still it was more interesting then some of the other stuff around at the moment.Violence as metaphor, blood as similie and action as activity these are concepts that i'm happy with in a movie as long as there is some sort of decent/story/plot/acting etc to tie them all together. Please beware of reading the next Shoulda been called 'the tragedy...due to ending being spoiled if you haven't seen it yet.",Null,0,1,28 April 2004
Troy," SEAN BEAN SHOULD BE IN 'ODDYSEUS' or 'THE ODDYSEY'
","This was not as good as I'd hoped it would be; BRad pitt was good, Eric Bana was good, however the stand out performance was that of SEAN BEAN who is well known for his workmanlike performances in films such as RONIN with Deniro and Jean reno and as a Poignantly powerful but confused BOROMIR (one of the most human characters in LOTR (if only for his human failings- the characters that is)). In this his (Sean Beans) Odyseus is a wiley warrior who is (almost) psychoanalytical in his knowledge and understanding; it was a masterful performance. I really would be pleased if some one were to make a movie about Odyseus for somewhere between $20 to $50 million ('cause it wouldn't be fair to rest the weight of $100 million or even $200 million on Seans shoulders) with SEAN as the Star/Lead and to make sure it will be a success make it a rollicking psychological action adventure film. I think it would be cool too to see Sean Bean, patrick Swayze and Michael Keaton in one movie as 3 brothers in some sort of action adventure film. Either way I Know that his performance in Troy was one that I greatly appreciated and identified with.",Null,0,1,23 November 2004
