The Blair Witch Project," great scare
","The Blair Witch Project manages to do something that few movies have ever done for me, scare me. In a world where studio's think that hyper stylized, CGI filled mosters are the only way for audiences to be scared, the blair witch project finds terror in the haunted woods of our own imagination. The movie builds subtly (a pile of rocks outside the tent, loud nosies in the dark, mysterious stick figures) but through this seemingly vague approach, the audience is allowed to conjure up monsters far more terrifying than anything Hollywood could manufacture. the movies also does a terrific job of creating an aura of despair. most effectively though, the movie plays on our own primal fears and that is what truly makes it one of the best horror movies i have seen.",10,3,6,5 September 2006
