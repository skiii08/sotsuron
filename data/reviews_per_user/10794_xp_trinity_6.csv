Catch Me If You Can," Pure fun
","In the recent years we all got used to see Spielberg making serious sombre movies. For a change Catch Me If You Can is a relaxing and entertaining movie. It is funny in a very intelligent way. It is a good movie with excellent actors, directing and music.Must see.",Null,0,1,10 March 2003
Memento," Brilliant
","Memento is probably the best film I've seen this year. A bit confusing at certain points but once you get the hang of it, it gets truly enjoyable.I've wanted to see it since last year - some of my friends have seen it abroad and recommended it strongly. Purely intellectual entertainment - keeps you focused and alert from the beginning to the end. (Or was it the other way around?!) Next thing I'll do is buy the DVD for further reference.",10,0,2,2 December 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Could have done without Reloaded
","Having just seen the final part of the trilogy, I am quite convinced that it could have been a two-logy or whatever it is called. Even better, it could have been much better if The Matrix remained just one film.Anyways, out of all three, Reloaded sucked the most. Not that Revolutions got any nearer to The Matrix, but it was much closer to it. It had almost the same atmosphere as the first part. Ironically, just now they are showing The Matrix on one of the TV channels and I, of course, am watching it. So I couldn't help but confirming my impression that Revolutions is the sequel to The Matrix. Reloaded wasn't.What I liked the most about Revolutions was that it was leading somewhere - to the logical end of it all. Maybe that's what it was meant to be after all. In Revolutions there was much less talk and fighting without purpose, while it appered that in Reloaded it was an end in itself. What I didn't like the most was the ending. I mean, WHAT THE HELL?! Are we to sit tight and wait for some more sequels or what?! I understand that maybe someday the Wachowski brothers might run out of money and decide to use the good old recipe, but this would really suck. Just look at what happened to the Star Wars - it was a cult until Lucas decided to make some more money out of it. As a friend put it after the movie: 'I know you are a huge fan of The Matrix, but would you like to see it spoiled?' I guess she's right. So I suggest, leave it like this or you'll spoil it for us.AT leas it was not totally 'and lived happily ever after...'",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well...
","Well, it's not bad but it's not the best either. I was expecting much more than I got. Perhaps the reason is that LOTR 1 was absolutely brilliant and set high expectations. Perhaps another reason is the fact that I am a hardcore fan and have read the book innumerable times.Still, I accepted some changes in the LOTR 1. In The Two Towers, however, there are things that I cannot understand and/or accept.Mind you, I am not saying the movie is bad! It's just that I've spent an year in expecting to see something equally brilliant and exciting as the Fellowship.Now I will not be the one to start the endless discussion about the director's ideas and all this blah-blah. I just want to say that certain changes of the original plot do not contribute whatsoever to a better movie.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW The kiss and hug part is all right - people who have not read the book have to understand the drama of Aragorn and Arwen. But, for god's sake, why changing some crucial details in the battle of Helm's Deep?! The elves' arrival and the speech of their leader was a horrible cliche. Not to mention Frodo and Sam's trip to Osgilliath - now that was really too much. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe ents were quite meager - I am sure that PJ would have cut them out the way he cut out Tom Bombadil in LOTR 1 if he could. The outcome of the entmoot and the following speech was yet another horrible cliche. As a result, at certain points, I was outright bored and/or was shaking my head in complete confusion and bewilderment. (I've never thought that I will be bored during this movie.)Now some good words. Gollum was really brilliant - too sad he is a computer graphic, not a human. He deserves an Oscar for his part.The effects in general were Ok, though, during the battle for Helm's Deep the orcs were flying aside like toothpicks. The crossing of the Dead Marshes was creepy enough to scare me out of my wit.The Two Towers time and time again reminded me that New Zealand has a very pretty nature and made me wish to go there.Once again, the film is not bad at all, but could have been better. No matter what I will go and see it again any time soon.",9,0,0,3 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Boring
","I have spent so much time anticipating the new Tarantino movie that at the moment I got my hands on Kill Bill, I sat down to watch it.Unfortunately, it was one of the most boring Saturday nights I have ever had. The film started promising and I braced myself for enjoyable time. After the first half an hour, however, I started feeling physical pain from watching it. It dragged on and on but led me nowhere. Only the fact that it was made by one of the cult directors of our time kept my eyes on the screen. Very boring.",Null,1,1,8 December 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," quite amazing
","It took me two viewings to make up my mind about it and now I must say I find it quite amusing and amazing. Of course, the mind-blowing experience of the first Matrix could not possibly be repeated but still I think it was a good film. The first 40 minutes or so, however, were terribly boring and absolutely superfluous - the Wachowski brothers could have used the money and screen time for something else. Especially cheesy were the scenes with the 'fan club' of Neo and the 'they need you / I need you' line - as if we have forgotten that we are watching a Hollywood production.The rave scene at Zion was also absolutely pointless, not to mention the fact that at certain moments Zion reminded me of a number of other films seen before. I mean, the Wachowski brothers have shown that they have the vision and imagination to come up with something better than that.Fortunately in the Reloaded there were certain attempts for comic relief, which against the background of the dark future and the upcoming major battle were very welcome. I truly enjoyed the gallery of new characters in Reloaded.I very much hope to get to see The Twins in the last part - I found them quite amusing. The 'Burly Brawl' scene and the highway chase were by far the two peaks in the movie and are definitely worth every cent spent on them.In conclusion, I can hardly wait for the conclusion of the trilogy and in the meantime will perhaps go several more times to see Reloaded.",10,0,0,31 May 2003
