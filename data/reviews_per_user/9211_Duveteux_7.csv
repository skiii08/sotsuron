Insidious: Chapter 2," Much Improved
","I'm a cynic, I saw this movie with no expectations. I said 'let's rent Insidious 2 just because we watch all horror movies no matter how bad and this is the only one we haven't seen yet'.I genuinely dislike the first.I disagree with the top review that if you liked the first you'll like the second - it is true, but that's just a given! Blatant remark. But if you DIDN'T like the first I think you'll find the second makes up for some of the disappointment.I went away from the first just a bit bemused. I think it was the fact what you don't see is scarier to me than what you do and this movie seemed to want to show you the demon without living up to any expectations. If you're going to reveal something that's ominously lurking in the shadows it's a brave move and you have to match the fear of when it couldn't be seen... I found the whole thing anti-climactic and I swore off seeing the second before I knew it was going to be made.The second however has actually entertained me throughout. I cannot lie. It's still not funny where it's supposed to be and they still reveal too much of the shadow lurkers, but it's compensated by a much better story and pace. It feels more like a horror movie instead of a joke...",10,0,0,9 February 2014
It," Who says Pennywise cannot be otherwise?
","I think a lot of people dive out of cinemas angry and review things before they've had a breather and a think and sometimes a re-viewing can help quell that immediate HATE reaction.I've seen this new IT twice in the cinema because I really wanted to come to terms with what I wasn't happy with and what I was happy with before ranting or approving.I did not like Pennywise as soon as he appeared in this movie the first time I saw it. I was cynical and thought Bill's portrayal was a bit silly and bizarre and not at all charming or funny like Curry.I went away a little grumpy, mostly because of the missing lines. When IT is in the fridge I'd have suppressed a little happy squeal if he'd said 'This is a little inconvenient, Eddie, just hold on while I make a few... adjustments', it was teasing us that it would be the case when he was tapping his fingers, just teeeasing us!! Or if the sink had gurgled 'you'll die if you try'. Good God, he didn't even say the infamous line, 'Oh yes, Georgie, they float, and down here with me... you'll float too!' He DOES say 'beep beep Ritchie', and although I was pleased this line actually made me think maybe it's a good thing he didn't say the rest because I'm not sure those charismatic, confident, cocky lines are well suited to this new interpretation of the clown.Bill may not be charismatic, but there's almost something interestingly naive about the chuckling baby faced clown in the gutter. Something child-like. Something I can see would attract the kids equally well as being charismatic and funny. And the contrast between the baby faced gutter clown and the later deformed by pole through face and menacingly tall and drooling kitchen scene clown gives a good comparative perspective on the manipulative shape shifting monster. Take a look at a picture of the gutter clown opposed to the clown poised to pounce at Ritchie on the coffin lid online and it's actually quite a cool transformation from careful, hidden predator to something all encompassing, evil and powerful.I'd actually say Bill's portrayal is more like a monster posing as a human than Curry's is, because he tries to be human and never quite gets there! He seems more animal, more like a hyena that has learned to mock us. Those wonky eyes, that baffling ill-defined voice - both age and gender are undefined at times. He is consistently strange and 'other', and that is fitting. Could say he's a bit alien (nudge nudge).So yeah, I like this interpretation, too. It's new. That doesn't have to be sacrilege.Am I a Millennial? I was born in 1988 and I was scared of Curry's Pennywise as a child of around 8-10 when I first saw it, like a lot of 'original' fans. I like the first adaptation although it isn't scary to me anymore, Curry's acting is still brilliant. I do not think I'm blinkered by the Millennial generation's tastes at all. I don't think it's a generational issue.The reason this film changed the dates from the 50s to the 80s was purely to make the year the next film comes out as close to the true date, implying Pennywise has re-awoken from his 27 year slumber in real time (or approximately). It isn't something that's done to appeal to the Stranger Things fans, but is trying to be clever in bringing IT to life today. The original adaptation would have been set proximate to the modern day at the time just coincidentally, so why not do the same with this one by bringing it forward? Not so much harm in that.As an aside I was very surprised reading someone on here thinking IT is a remake of Stranger Things. Stranger Things is deliberately borrowing a lot from already existent horror, including IT. It isn't a coincidence that is has similarities and it is meant to be like IT. It is a multiple homage.Anyway.IT is not scary. No. I will have no sleepless nights. And I am a horror fan. But I am also just a fan of good movies. This is just good fun, if you don't have to be so precious.It doesn't have to be like the original, and it is a little bit like the book, like how the original was only a bit like the book.Neither adaptation IS the book. And thank God for that cause King is a terribly verbose and slightly pervy writer and he spoils the comparative innocence captured in both adaptations that makes the children so likable.Aside from the orgy, I'm not sure anyone would take to the leper chasing Eddie around offering him a BJ like he does in the book, either. Let's just admit some of that book needs to stay in the book! You don't have to be born in the 90s or dislike horror to enjoy it, and I'm still Team Curry if it ever came down to a Pennywise-off, because that man is just terrifying dressed as a clown and delivers those lines so charmingly.I also appreciate that they gave the kids license to make the characters their own and don't necessarily 'act the part', I think they all work well. No one, I don't think, is denying that the kids do a great job. I just wanted to put my penny's worth in for the clown.",9,2,3,1 October 2017
Us," Why couldn't it have been spider people?
","I actually think a far less complicated plot like spider people and developing that hint at the beginning that spiders have some involvement would have been much easier to pull off!
1. It'd explain why they live off raw rabbit. I don't even buy that rabbits symbolise test subjects and that's the reason for that random nugget, just WHY??
2. Why they survive doing c-sections on themselves without any medical help - cause if they are 'only human like us' then what the hell?
3. Why they move in a particularly agile way and seem to scuttle about.
4. Why they live in the potentially very spooky tunnels scuttling away under America without the 'it's all the government/a big conspiracy' excuse.
That excuse isn't actually explained enough to be a justifiable reason why it was happening. It doesn't even criticise the human condition or America like you might expect, it just throws that out there and leaves it as it is. We're just supposed to accept it being those pesky government folks again doing darstardly deeds. Dah. Those guys..!
Even the idea of them being 'shadow people' instead of text subjects, is much better. When the woman says 'once upon a time there was a girl and she had a shadow' I thought the idea of shadow people had a lot of potential, as well.
Why were they trying to control human kind with doubles? Who knows? But also by the end, who cares? There's just too many loose ends and something simple would have needed far less justification than this mess needed. Sometimes you have to go with the plot that just offers better scares than be overly ambitious and fall at the hurdles.I didn't hate it, I just, like so many, wanted to like it.",6,0,0,4 April 2019
Evil Dead," Heather and Alessa?
","I liked the film. I'm a deadite and I love the original, the original is still far scarier (if the original is 10 out of 10 then this is a 7) and I was waiting for bits like the cellar scene to be far creepier. I expected some insane giggling and a character called Linda who just won't die! I was genuinely waiting when all the girls introduced themselves for one to say Linda. But I liked this as a separate movie... and it has some nods in the direction of original fans. The thing I had a problem with that I can't escape is that it is Silent Hill in parts. Even the siren sound has been stolen in the end battle. Sure it's a lot better than the Silent Hill film featuring the Heather and Alessa battle, good God Silent Hill movie is absolute rubbish in every way, so this is done better! In essence it's been nicked. It had the uncomfortable reminder of Silent Hill right from the moment 'the abomination' first appears to our protagonist in the woods.I understand most horror movies steal things from others, but it was the siren that made me think 'nah you can't take that as well' and unfortunately I can't forgive it. I think the lines should have just stayed the same instead of changing ever so slightly, they could have just used the originals, like the song mummy used to sing them to sleep with... on a sidenote why was 'not another peep, time to go to sleep' cut from the movie, cause it's in the advert? And why is it 'I'll feast on your soul' when I was dying for 'I'll swallow your soul' or 'dead by dawn' or 'we want what is yours, life!', anything! No levitation! Naaaay! I did miss Raimi bits. They did make it more about 'a demon' than I cared for and I don't like the new necronomicon with it's silly scrawlings of foul language to stop you reading it... I'm also a little sad that daylight doesn't rid you of possession! But this is all irrelevant because in itself it's a good horror movie. Just try not to think of anything you loved about the original and try to ignore the Silent Hill undertone. Good, good... P.S. my favourite bit in the new one is the blonde girl's possession, from the hand to her death. To me her name was Linda.",7,1,3,13 August 2013
Mama," Mama didn't follow me home
","I love that every movie i have seen of Guillermo's has a story i haven't seen before. I love the fantasy and distorted imagery. There is also always a great deal of sentimentality involved in his horror. I don't know why he's focused on the loss of children and their connection to living people, but it is always touching.Mama is not scary, however. It is sweet and a little creepy with some memorable scenes, even a little humour. Unfortunately i wasn't paranoid looking around my room after coming home at 10pm after the film had finished expecting a dead lady to be crawling out from the wall, though. It isn't something that played on my mind and that bothers me! Good horror always gets me psychologically and wakes me up in the night feeling like something is in the room.Mama didn't visit me.It is an original story, but there are bits which are very predictable, some bits which are just pointless, and some bits that didn't make sense. There was a gap left in the story, too, which i'm going to post a question about because i don't want to include spoilers here. That let it down for me. I was confused by it.To be honest i didn't like the men and their parts in the film much! It was all about the little girls and they are fantastic little actors. Just wasn't scary, so i can't give it more than what i have... regrettably. Horror needs to follow me home.",6,0,1,14 March 2013
It Chapter Two," King's realm
","This recent incarnation of It is not scary, but I still love both films regardless. They feel really true to the 80s/90s adaptations of King, which are indefinitely flawed and stray from the origin stories, as well, and arguably they are not very scary, either...There is a massive preference for humour over scares in the second instalment, which I actually think is a wise move.
It starts off uncomfortable and dark with the homophobic attack from the book and you think It has also come of age and that the film will be more adult in theme, but as soon as the Losers are back together you also feel like you're in the company of friends again. It becomes, like the first film, a story of friendship and overcoming personal demons rather than a horror story.I was worried the adult cast would ruin the warm feelings I had for the Losers, because the kids were so great. I would only question Mike's portrayal which is unhinged and considering he plays the pivotal role in the book as the narrator, he comes across like he's just lost his mind in this film and he's the least likeable or noticeable character... The book gives the black guy the ONLY voice for once by making him the narrator and that is completely diminished in this film, which I do have a problem with.
Derry is a rotten and prejudiced place, regardless of whether the clown has an influence over that or is to blame for that (I don't believe It is the cause, I think King was commenting on the evil in humanity and the clown just takes advantage of the fear we create in our own communities) and it's important to keep that at the forefront. It is always going to be relevant.It feels like the same kind of production as Christine and Thinner and Dreamcatcher and Stand By Me and Creepshow and the original Pet Sematary. And the King cameo helps this film feel like it's a nostalgic, warm and familiar place to be, too. We are back in Maine and back in King's bizarre and surreal realm where let's face it, even if It was a perfect adaptation of the book, everyone would still exit the cinema with similar questions!",9,9,15,7 September 2019
The Conjuring," Why Did I Fall For The Trap?
","I always do this. I see a film get 10 out of 10 and people rave about it being terrifying and I get my hopes up like maybe this will be completely different to what's out there right now. Maybe it will be a good ghost story, a good classic horror I'll lose sleep over or will repeat itself in my mind on the night bus home until I become paranoid of every dark figure on the street.I remember the day I came home on a night bus scared to look out of the window cause even my own reflection might change into the face of another! You know what? It's been so long since that day I don't remember what that feels like anymore.It's OK, I'll give it 6 out of 10. The last half an hour is better than the first hour. There's nothing in it we haven't seen before in the past few years.I don't see the point of the doll possessed by a demon when it does nothing scary and is far too farcical to be considered scary. A creepy doll could easily be a simple porcelain doll with blank expression and vacant eyes staring. Remember when a room full of perfectly ordinary ornate dolls sounded ominous? It doesn't have to be a clown-like ventriloquist dummy with scars that doesn't even look convincingly like it was ever a child's toy but destined to be a demon conduit.Maybe the doll was the idea of the person involved with the making of Saw. Cause it seems like it was too similar in its clownishness.I'm ignoring the fact this is 'based on a true story' by the way. Maybe the doll was real and did look exactly like that. Maybe everything in the film is spot on and why should they bend the truth to appease my want for seeing a horror movie that's different to others on offer out there? Fair enough! Coming from the people who told us absolutely everything in the Amityville Horror was true, though... I'm inclined to believe they've bent the truth somewhat and could have done more to make me scared of my own shadow.The only good bits reminded me of other films, the crazy old witch ghost who vomits blood into the woman's mouth is suspiciously similar to the old bat from Drag me to Hell, which once again has been done - IF it hadn't been done it would have been a good bit, but because I can only think of something else when I see it...nah.I'm fed up with them trying ghost stories and possession horror. Please find a new way to try and scare me because you only seem to be throwing the same things at me. It's like a ghost jumping out at me and hiding back away in the same spot for the next time I come in because it thinks 'it worked once, so this must be the only way to do it'. Only the first time will make me jump. Eventually it just becomes tedious.",6,109,175,7 August 2013
