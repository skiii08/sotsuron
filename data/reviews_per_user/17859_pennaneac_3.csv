Oblivion," Better late than never to discover a pure jewel.
","I do not want to spoil anything to peoples who never seen this movie.
To be simple, you want something original, very well done, with everything perfectly in place like a symphony ? This movie will be exaclty what you seek.Perfect balance between story/scifi/action/idea/visual/music, PERFECT!
After watching this movie, when you reach the end, it's like an angel flewing away. You are at peace with a big smile saying to yourself 'i love this movie'My only regrets : it's too short, i want more.",10,1,2,26 October 2019
Joker," Correct movie, not the Joker story at all.
","Fisrt of all this is a nice movie, with a correct story and a very good acting.
But a little boring.The real question here is WHY did they change the Joker original story ?
It's a very strange choice from the producer.As usual in DC universe, they do not respect the original story AT ALL, and rewrite it from scratch around something less commun 'the madness of a man' that's a shame because the orginal one is very good and deserve a movie who will expose the original Joker story in full.If you do not know the original story i advise to read ' The killing joke 'For me and my friends who know and follow the joker about 35 years now,
it is not the Joker. I do not reconize the joker at all into this movie, just a crazy clown who lost his mind. If you tint the hair of the man in red and put blue makeup into his face you can rename the movie the title you want.The creation of the Joker into the Batman universe are nothing to do with this movie. The original story is honestly way better.Another thing i do not like into this movie is the fact they never get the point of of view of the original Joker. For him madness is perfection. He do not want the people to mimic him, follow him and copy him. He do not initiate any revolution of any sort. He despise peoples and live only for himself.Into the original story Joker become Joker after his pregnant wife died and himself fall into a tank of chemical mixture. The green hair color and the white skin color are not makeup at all, they are the results of the chimical. After that his mind was broken.Into this movie it is just a simple man who take meds, and become nuts because life is hard with him. Even the laugh is a medical condition.
Sorry but it is not good at all. At this state everybody can become the Joker because life is not easy.Joker use crazy people and i say USE! to work for him.
Because normal people or outlaw do not want to be close to this man 'way to dangerous'. At the end of the movie there is clown everywhere !! Sure!! (apprently the producer do not even understand who the joker is)So, if you are a fan of the original joker, this movie is not for you.
If you seek a drama of a man falling into madness, this movie is for you.",6,3,5,11 November 2019
