Minority Report," Breath-Taking!
","I read a lot of previous posts about this movie,too. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years, in my opinion. This is  definitely the perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir since Blade Runner, which I recommmend you see if you like this one. The plot is intelligent and fresh and very original. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie, because it is . Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director, no doubt. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? Not to me it isn't! It is worth seeing again and again?Yes it is!As a film lover and not really a Spielberg fan, i can say it is one amazing movie and one of Spielberg's most complex film plot in years.",10,0,0,20 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yoda kicks ass
","Everything George Lucas did wrong in 'The Phanton Menace,' the disappointing prequel to his 'Star Wars' trilogy, he does right - brilliantly right - in 'Attack of the Clones.' This time out, the force is strong in him - in a very big way.This fifth chapter of the sprawling space saga recounts the coming of age of Annakin Skywalker (the Jedi knight who will become Darth Vader) as the democratic Republic is on the brink of a war which will ultimately transform it into the evil Empire.Lucas wisely returns to the elements that made the original 'Star Wars' such a groundbreaking success: timeless mythological themes; endearing characters; heart-pumping action scenes; and the energetic derring-do of Saturday matinee serials. And no Jar-Jar Binks Jokes in sight! Joy!I promise not to reveal major plot points, but the story begins when Jedi knight Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, maturing nicely into Alec Guinness) and his protege Annakin (Hayden Christensen) are summoned to protect the regal Padme (Natalie Portman); the former Queen Amidala has taken a Hillary Clinton turn and is now an outspoken senator.The great success of the first 'Star Wars' was its cunning blend of familiar movie genres - sampling not only science fiction serials but gun-slinging westerns and fantasy classics like 'The Wizard of Oz.'In 'Attack of the Clones,' Lucas serves up heaping helpings of film genres including the film noir detective, sci-fi paranoia, political thrillers, and action scenes that recall everything from James Bond to 'Jason and the Argonauts' and Robin Hood's merry men battling it out in Sherwood Forest.Venturing into territory that's totally new to him, Lucas also gives us a classical star-crossed love story between Annakin and Padme (the future parents of Luke and Leia). Christensen and Portman are exceptionally fine actors, giving emotional depth to the two most complex characters in the 'Star Wars' canon. (And as screen lovers, they make 'Titanic's' Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet look positively homely.)Seeds are sown of plot developments yet to come as the saga takes on a generational and mythological weight that's worthy of the Greeks. A turning point in Annakin's emotional transformation makes for an unforgettable scene of pain, love and fury, the likes of which we've never seen in a 'Star Wars' movie.Lucas also recaptures the blend of humor, satire and adventure that seemed effortless in the early films but was nearly absent in the dry, impersonal 'Phantom Menace.' Familiar characters and relationships are in full force here; Obi Wan and Annakin have a loving but contentious mentor/pupil thing going on; C3-P0 experiences a hilarious identity crisis; and in two words: Yoda rocks!Samuel Jackson is on board as Jedi Master Mace Windu; Ian McDiarmid is back as the not-to-be-trusted political bigwig Palpatine; and Christopher Lee debuts as the dark side Jedi Master Count Dooku (at what point can we start to giggle at some of these names?).Jimmy Smits fills out his Renaissance costume nicely as Senator Bail Organa but doesn't get much to do yet. (Oh wait, that was Princess Leia's last name - I see an adopted daughter in his future...)The saga also continues its generational theme with the introduction of warrior Jango Fett, and his son Boba (who will grow into the feared bounty hunter of 'The Empire Strikes Back').Makes want to see that film!The film is a magnificent thing to look at. From the glittering urban sprawl of Coruscant (think Manhattan to the tenth power) to the red-rock planet Geonosis, and the romantically sumptuous paradise of Naboo, the film's digital artisans break new ground in eye-popping production design.Breath-taking or what?!In it's strong storytelling, depth of character and vigorous action scenes, 'Attack of the Clones' is a mature piece of filmmaking, created by a man who has returned to his creative roots. No more Jar Jar Binks jokes (hooray!!), George. It's good to have you back.I'll recomend it to anyone, even those who are still recovering from the disappointing 'The Phantom Menace'!",8,1,1,20 August 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," funnier than the two Toy Story films!
","This is really a hilarious animated comedy. Although i was surprised that they did not have any musical numbers until the ending credits! But who cares! This film is fantastic! With a great cast including John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Frank Oz it is really got some talented voices to the delightful array of characters! There was nothing at all wrong with this computer animated classic! Not a single line! Nothing! It is just the perfect imaginative comedy! Excellent plot , extremely good score from the great Randy Newman, this is truly another great film from Pixar!",10,0,1,6 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," best film ever made
","this should have deserved some more Oscars. Never mind. There's alway the sequel! This film has everything I like in a film; special effects, thrills, monsters, a good cast (particulary Christopher Lee and Sir Ian MacKellen) and a good adaption of a good story. I hope Peter Jackson does not disappoint me with his next film being awful, particulary his King Kong project which i have doubt on! See this film! 100 times better than Star Wars or any fanatsy film i have seen! This deserves to be a classic and be with all the greatest films of all time, like Citizen Kane!",10,1,1,9 September 2002
American Beauty," A Review of American Beauty (1999)
","As far as debuts go, they can impress cinema goers to see more from that director, such as Tarintino's Reservoir Dogs, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane- although that one took some time thou! Now we have another one to add to our favourite directorial debut lists, as Sam Mendes directs one of the most memorable modern dramas, in an era filled with effects laden blockbuster epics.American Beauty, for those who have yet seen this yet, is, if you boil it down to the basics, about a middle aged father going through a mid-life crisis- and what a crisis it is too, as he has fallen in love with a high school cheer leader. But haven't we all seen films involving a mid-life crisis narrative before? Yes, but not like this!Beautiful shot scene by scene, Mendes is a director who knows how to make the most of the camera for cinematic impact; whether it comes to either directing video camera footage of a plastic bag, to that renowned dream sequence- yes, this is the one with partially naked girl on the ceiling of rose petals! Mendes also knows how to get the most of his cast, in particular Kevin Spacey in the main role- when you though he outdone himself in the Usual Suspects, then you should see him in more dramatic action in this film.One of the things that this film does is to have an original message- and it is not something along the lines of not getting sidetracked in your marriage! The universal message of seeing 'beauty' in everything around you with definitely bedazzled film goers alike- either that or they start starring with burning passion at plastic bags blowing in the wind!Having seen all of Mendes' current outings at the silver screen, the intriguing comic book adaptation Road to Perdition and the excellent war biopic Jarhead, American Beauty will definitely be the one he will be most remember for with great reasons: Kevin Spacey's finest performance since the Usual Suspects, the picture perfect cinematography, the fascinating message of 'beauty', and reinventing the mid-life crisis movie forever. Also, this film, like most classics, has memorable usage of music, and definitely one of the best, and memorable, directorial debuts in this recent chapter of movie history.",10,0,1,17 January 2007
Aliens," Truly Fantastic
","Picture this. You're staying in on a Saturday night. You decide to wacth a sci-fi thriller to keep you awake for another 2 hours. You thought it was not going to be good until you actually see it. This is just how I watched this classic sci-fi: my all-time favourite sci-fi flick!The effects are pretty incredible, the gore is marvellous and the tank charging into the alien nest is truly the highlight if this exciting masterpiece! 'Die you bitch', my favourite all-time sci-fi film quote, just sums up the incredible atmosphere where our female commando kicks ass with a giant alien. Truly breath-taking! If you have not seen this picture , you just have been thrilled or chilled enough in your boring little lives! See this science-fiction classic. I guaranteed you will not be disappointed!",10,1,2,6 October 2002
Men in Black II," the only good thing in this film is Wacko's cameo!
","I thought that this was going to be better than the first film. But I was wrong! It's dreadful. The same plot only reversed, because Agent J makes former Agent K into the same Agent he used. Absolutely pointless! I'd rather see the original back on the silver screen than this rubbish! I would give only 1 star for the film, which isn't at all original.Another star for proving that Johnny Knoxville is not just a hilarious stunt man, but a good actor that is sadly over-shadowed by the main roles. And one more for the only thing good, and original, in this film was Wacko's, Michael Jackson, cameo, were he plays Agent M who seems to be trapped with some penguins. Don't bother seeing it, unless you want to waste your money!",4,0,0,31 August 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," a work of genius
","This has to be the first and one of the best Tim Burton films I have watched when I was a kid. Surprisingly, the movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special.It's the breath-taking 3D stop-motion animation! This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probably the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are positioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that explains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.A work of genius!Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch! Tim Burton is truly a cinematic genius for coming up with such a fantastic idea and make a fantastic film out of it! He should, in 10 years times, receive an honourary Academy Award for his brilliant film career. With a film like this he should be very proud of what he has achieved  in this film alone!",10,1,2,31 August 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Extraodinary!
",This is truly a masterpiece in its own right! From the classical introduction to the very end! It was worth every second of celluloid it used! The monkey sequence was well filmed and the Blue Danube music in the space station sequence is truly original! There is nothing is dislike about the film at all! I was totally glued to my seat from start to finish! Truly Klassic Kubrick!,10,0,2,6 October 2002
Toy Story," very good songs
","this has some of my favourite songs ever to be used for an animated film: Strange Things and You've Got a Friend in Need. the songs makes this now dated(!) film more original than Toy Story 2. The animation is fantastic and cutting-edge at the time. Also, it's only 6 years old now, the animation is still as impressive as it was back all those year ago. What else can I say. But this is 1990s equivalent to Snow White and the 7 dwarfs and,indeed, a lot better!",10,0,0,12 September 2002
Singin' in the Rain," the best hollywood musical since The Wizard of Oz.
","fifty years on, it stills gives a glorious feeling for hollywood fanatics worldwide. And why not! This is, on a basic plot, a hollywood about hollywood! Confusing? Not really. This film is based around the lates 1920s, when the talkies revolution took place! And it basically, focuses on the rise of Don Lockwood, a former stuntman on slient films becomes a superstar overnight, alongside his former music colleque, Don Lockwood. Donald o'connor's character goes over the top when singing Make 'em Laugh! But who cares! It's extremely more entertaining than other 'over-the-top' comic stars, like Jim Carrey!But it is the classic Singin' in the Rain sequence with Gene Kelly prancing about in the streets on a rainy evening is classic film-making. No other musical has such brilliantly cherography  and a well-directed dancing sequence filmed in all my film-wacthing life! It's a gem! This really meant the hollywood classics that are not made like this gem anymore! Not even the modern-day hollywood can compete with classic film-making that it used to be when this was realesed! Come on! This film was entirely made with no computer graphics in site. If it did, in a re-make, it would deteriate the quality dramatically! This is truly the best hollywood musical since the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz!",10,2,5,23 September 2002
Toy Story 2," a classic sequel
","in the history of sequels, most of them are not as good as expected. But this has an acception! It is in fact a lot better, in terms of animation, than the original. It is in fact all round better than the orignal. Apart from the songs, which fails to recieve the Best Song oscar, and are not as memorable as the first. But who cares, when you got a story line which is fun, adventurous and excitement, despite the reversal of Buzz saving Woody this time rather than vice versa. Randy Newman did not need to waste his lyrical magic in this rich plot. But he is good at it so it does not really matter. This reversal on the main plot did not work at all in Men in Black 2. Also, the toy restorer is none other than the old man from the Oscar-winning animated short film, Geri's Game! You do not get guest appearances rarely in animated films. So this is rare in this field of animated films.For Goodness Sake! See it! Don't waste your time seeing another animated sequel! See this one; the animated equivalent to the Godfather part 2!",10,0,1,16 September 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," one of the best children's films in years
","there is nothing wrong with this splendid and entertaining adaption of JK Rowling's first book of the young wizard. Although my mum, who has read the book, said that they did miss some scenes from the book, as a movie-goer I enjoyed it! This is probably one of the best children's films since Babe, so only a 6 years difference. So is it good? Well, it is over-rated but performances from Robbie Coltrane and even John Cleese, his first children's film role since The Wind in the Willows, makes the film enjoyable for me. And of course, Harry Potter himself, Daniel Raddcliffe, should become the next Macaulay Culkin as he is truly brilliant in his role. So with some new and some old stars in this magnificent film, this was truly a good rival for The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring!",9,0,0,25 October 2002
Castle in the Sky," Miyazaki Takes to the Sky: A Review of Castle in the Sky
","Hayao Miyazaki has become the toast of the animation world with his effortless successfully epics, like Princess Monoke and Spirited Away, establishing a reputation of international acclaim. But, long before he made epics with environmental messages and films with more magic than you can shake a magic wand with, he made this; Tenk청 no shiro Rapyuta, better known as Castle in the Sky, which pre-dates all of his box-office grossing fantasies he has become renowned for the world over. In addition, in my humble opinion, Castle in the Sky remains his best film by far.For those of you who have not viewed this epic yet, the storyline is a boy becomes friend with this girl, who has fallen from the sky but landed safe fully with a magic medallion she wears. They soon end up being chased by pirates and agents trying to hunt down her medallion, as this is the only artefact to a floating castle known as Laputa; you need to bear in mind that the boy always wanted to explore this legendary castle. So, with his passion in mind, the boy and girl eventually team up with the pirates, and set off to find this castle, although they have been followed by the agents to steal its treasures. I will leave the story there, but will note that the ending is climatic and exciting, as they work out who the girl really is.With such a story that is never that straightforward at times, there is more that such a fantastic story that makes this my all-time favourite animated film. Why, you ask? For starters, there are action-packed sequences, like the chase sequence through the mines, executed with great suspense as well as being entertaining to the audience. There are also some great comic moments, such as the men showing off their muscles before they start a fight in the street. Trust me, with the character designs for these guys, and the character animation done well to exploit their expressions; it is only just the tip of the iceberg of some great comic moments present in Miyazaki's masterpiece. Also, as a member of the audience, the development of the main characters is done brilliantly, as we view a relationship between the boy and the girl throughout this film. This is something you do not see that much in animated cinema, as such schmaltz in over polished western animated films spoil this progression tragically.So, for those who think Hayao Miyazaki is just another celebrated animation director for this current climate of animated cinema in recent years, they better think again. This is because he has been successfully establishing his trademarks, such as the focus on children and his indulgent passion for flight, brilliantly for a long time before he made his truly deserved impact on the international scene. Castle in the Sky shows Miyazaki at his best, which is a standard he has been developing ever since, entertaining and fascinating millions worldwide along the way.",10,2,2,10 October 2005
Shrek," Definately an anti-Disney film, but has the same humble qualities to any pixar film
","Shrek is truly a gem in the standards of animation, which it truly deserved any award that it received, especially the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Why? Well, it was just the best-animated film of that year!
A truly unique adaptation to a children's picture book, where in the book Horribly hideous Shrek leaves home and terrifies everyone he encounters in his search for his equally ugly bride. While the feature film makes this somewhat simple children's story into a hilarious anti-Disney animated comedy! Now, according to the film, our title character (voiced brilliantly by Mike Myers) is an agreeable enough ogre who wants to live his days in peace. When the diminutive Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) evicts local fairy tale creatures (including the now-famous Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man), they settle in the ogre's swamp and Shrek wants answers from Farquaad. A quest of sorts starts for Shrek and his new pal, a talking donkey (played brilliantly by the incredible comedian Eddie Murphy), where battles have to be won and a princess (Cameron Diaz) must be rescued from a dragon lair in a thrilling action sequence! This plot is the kind of entertainment that certainly made the film the beloved classic that it is today! This is definitely suitable for anyone that hates Disney films (so I will like it as I cannot stand their over-rated pieces of work) as this spoofs most of their films, from Pinocchio all the way to Mulan, was ironically Murphy was involved! However, I disagree that it spoofs Pixar, except spoofing the good A Bug's Life. But, to be honest I find Pixar branded Disney, just because this conglomerate presents their work is a bit pointless, as all the work of Pixar is ten times better then the stuff Disney spew out to the public throughout the years. But I do not just make a contrast to Pixar films because that it is done wonderfully in computer animation, or that one of its films, Monster's Inc., was up for that Oscar too, but because it possesses the qualities that make Pixar films excellent. First of all the humour, visually and verbally, great music, by earning Bafta, Saturn, and Grammy nominations to prove it, and family appeal, colourful characters for the kids and interesting humour and spoofs of action films for the adults!So what I can I say to conclude my review. Great Voices provided by a brilliant cast to one of the best films to be based on a children's book! In addition, with many Annies for its impressive animation, this film has plenty of awards to prove its brilliance! Overall, definitely an anti-Disney film but has the same humble qualities to any Pixar film!",8,1,2,17 June 2003
Blade Runner," Dark and thought provoking, with a puzzling ending (contains spoilers)
","I absolutely loved this film for several reasons. First of all, the complex narrative, that develops throughout the film through different perspectives of different characters, which includes several replicants and the blade runner, wonderfully portrayed by Harrison Ford, himself. This, in my opinion, achieves a multi-layered and never biased account of what is going throughout this film as the blade runner attempts to track down these replicants. Secondly, whenever a specific sequence is made, such as Deckard's chase for the club performer or that replicant destroying its father, it is wonderfully structured as a sequence by establishing a master shot for that particular sequence by cutting in and out of the action to its master shot. Examples of this fine method of film-making is encountered with the owl being a sort of master shot when that replicant is destroying its 'father', and the blade runner on that train and the dancer on those stairs on that chase sequence. Thirdly, one of things that are not completely conventional of a sci-fi film is that it ends in an unusual, where Rick Deckard and Rachael are going down the elevator together. This brings out one question that has not really been answered throughout this film. Was Rachael a replicant? And if the answer was no, how come she somewhat failed that test, where they answer questions to a replicant suspect? But I am glad that this film ended this way, maybe because Ridley Scott, the director behind this cinematic masterpiece, wanted to leave that question unanswered and leave that to the audience imaginations making this film somewhat thought- provoking for the audience to conclude to their assumptions. But I will not as I might not be watching or analysing the film this way to answer this question, but, at the moment, I guess she is not. But, then again, if I ever watch this sci-fi treat again, I may come to a different conclusion. Another thing that made me marvel this film was that ending sequence, where that replicant is hunting down Deckard in J.F. Sebastian's house. That whole pin in the replicant's hand really brought a disturbing exhibition of how the replicants cannot feel death, while this one wanted the ability to die. Then Deckard gets chased out of the house and on top of the roof of that building. He tries to jump over to other sides but instead is now grasping onto that girder. That low-angle shot, where Deckard is holding onto that girder over of busy city life of this futuristic cityscape, looks well composed and a very memorable shot from that whole film. This indeed does sums up the blade runner's struggle to hunt down replicants perfectly. Overall, this is a dark and thought provoking science fiction masterpiece, with a puzzling ending that should baffles audiences for generations of science fiction film fans to come.",10,0,1,20 March 2004
Amélie," the best film i've seen which is in french!
","to be honest, i do not watch foreign films on a regular basis. But this gives me a terrefic impression on them! The plot is simple but sort blends with other stories as well to make the film very interesting. The basic plot is of course about Amelie's life and he she is trying to get a boy friend! Then another is of course that Amelie's friend where s/he takes her father's garden gnome around the world. That was pretty was extremely hilarious! But not as hilarious when Amelie thinks about how many orgasms are going on in town. Then, one by one, they show exactly how many there are going on! Strange, but it made me laugh out loud unlike any humour i have ever seen on film. Maybe because french humour is like that! I do not know! The computer graphics make the film very modern and suitable to today's modern cinema! The editing (particulary with the hilarious orgasm scene)makes you really get into it and there is nothing in the film that can possibly bore you to death. If so, i would like to hear it! This films makes you laugh, think, and sometimes shock you at the tragic moments, which is kind of rare in the film. But its a really light-hearted, really funny, french film. Also, until i see another good french film, the best film i have heard in french (with subtitles, otherwise i won't know what was going on)!",10,0,1,21 September 2002
Back to the Future," wow!
","Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite science-fiction comdey movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th(Yes that's how many times I watched it!) time of watching and never fails to bring a smile. Humour for all ages and a kick-ass DeLorean car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those young at heart?From Marty's 'Johnny B Goode' to Doc's classic quote 'Run For It Marty!' You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel 'Save The Clock Tower!'It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 10 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc, played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd in one of his best feature film roles, and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart. And with the director, Robert Zimericks, directing this masterpiece, you cannot go wrong with a combination  as this!",10,1,2,31 August 2002
Beetlejuice," Absolutely Hilarious!!
","Absolutely Hilarious!! Micheal Keaton must have had the greatest time doing that movie. It is one of his best. Watch the scene when Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis first see him on TV and he's doing the commercial. I laugh so hard every time I see that. It's a 10 for sure! And why not? It received a well deserved Oscar and Saturn Award for the amke-up, which is truly incredible at the time! This is one of Tim Burton's, excluding Batman, best films he ever made in the 1980s!",10,1,2,31 August 2002
