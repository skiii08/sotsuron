The Ring," Better off Dead...
","The movie started perfect, and actaully the whole film was great until near the end with the well.  The film failed to make any sense at all, and failed to explain how some things work.  I must say however, the images were extremley creepy and it had me jumping and cringing in my seats at times. But, all in all..this was a dissapointing film since it wasnt explained at all, just shock value.  Naomi Watts is hot, the actors are fine, direction is wonderful.**1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,18 October 2002

Lost in Translation," OVERRATED--- but not bad
","I enjoyed the film, laughed at moments.  Everyboyd played their characters well.  I dont find this film romantic, was bored at some points.. overall i was disapointed.. highly overrated./. but still worthy to check out.",Null,1,2,22 September 2003
American Beauty," One of the best films of all time!!
","'American Beauty' is a masterpiece is the eyes of filmaking, because it expresses true reality through the eyes of a very real and blunt human being.  Giving a review is hard for this type a movie because you don't want to give the wrong thing away because it might ruin it for someone.Bottom line: See this movie, and if you havent...what the hell are you waiting for?  This movie is amazing, and gives a great definiton to self discovery and realizing how money can make a person, and deals with many issues of our corrupt world today.My favorite thing of the film is that he supports marijuana!!! LONG LIVE WEED**** out of ****",Null,0,0,2 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," Amazing
","I knew this movie would be good just by the sound of it.  The best thing about this movie is that by the end you try to put two and two together but it just ends up as an empty conclusion. Its great.... No matter how open your mind is when you see this you will eb confused by the end,",Null,1,2,30 January 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," .....
","Kill Bill is crazy, energetic, fun, insane.. so i highly reccomend it. The music is wonderful and appropriate at all times.  The opening credit sequence is hypnotising, as well as flashbacks.... i cant wait till vol. 2",Null,0,0,10 October 2003
Pulp Fiction," Definetly One Of the Best Films Of All Time!!!
","This movie is full of obscanities, violence, it is gritty, gutter, shocking, real...and definetly the best.  What makes this movie, and not Slumber Party Massacre the best, is that this movie provides insight on the life of hitmen.  Generally speaking, a day in the life of a hitman, not really there life.  From what I seen, it was a day in the life of Jules and Vincent. That's why this movie is so excellent.  It is just nothing anybody has ever seen, and the title warns you before you enter the theater, and also provides a definition of 'pulp' before the movie starts.  The performances are amazing, providing an all star cast, throughout.  It's kinda hard who takes the cake.. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta both provide amazing performances....Rossana Arqueete is great as a peircing junkie, Uma Thurman, well, watch it and youll see... and so on and so on.What is there not to like about this movie?  If your looking for a 'gone With the Wind' you will not find it, this is a gritty, gutter movie, not afarid to let anything go, which is why Quentin Tarantino is my idol.",Null,2,5,13 March 2002
Psycho," We all go a little mad sometimes...
","We is there to say about 'Psycho' that has not been said before.  Ok, first off, this movie is genius..all the actors, and cre are genius.  If you don't like this movie, you OBVIOUSLY don't know horror.  Horror is not blood and guts, but the power of suspense, and thrills to control your mind. 'Psycho' follows that pattern. First off. dont see the remake.Don't get me wrong, I actually like the remake...but it's a chessy film, with bad acting.  If you wanna see the full monty, rent the original.  I havent found anyone (but my friends who only like gore horror) that dont like this movie.  What's not to like, the movie is not boring at all!!!The best part about this movie is that there are 2 plots and storylines mixed in one.  M&M (Money and Mother)I really don't want to give anything, not one thing away in this movie, cause that was Hitchcock's purpose (rent the dvd and you'll find out)**** out of ****",Null,0,0,13 March 2002
Halloween," 'Halloween' is more than a treat
","... It's an instant horror classic.  Now, many of today's viewers who have never seen the movie will call this movie boring and trite and probably compare it to 'scream'.  What no one undertsands is that... this was the first slasher movie EVER.  Now... some people consider 'Psycho' the grandfather of all slasher... i don't.  I consider 'Psycho' the grandfather of horror... cause i also consider the movie to be a drama/mystery/suspense. Now on to halloween.I remember, i first saw this movie after i saw 'halloween 6' in the theater. When i watched this movie, it amazed me, and i was at the tender age of 12, im 17 now.  This is my favorite movie of all time.  'Halloween' is not just any ordinary slasher flick, it is a beautifully well-made horror movie, and that is hard to say about horror movies.  The setting of this movie takes place in a small town in Illinois (haddonfield).  The fact that john carpentar captures, day, dusk, and night is awesome.  The leaves falling are just mesmerizing, makes you feel like your in october 31st!!!This is Jamie Lee Curtis' first role, and she does a helluva job on it. The other actors are very well convincing us that they are high school teenagers having a good time on Halloween.  Donald Pesleance....well...needs no introduction.Point blank, this is one of the best horror movies ever made, if not, the best.  It has little gore and heavy suspense, as it shows the first chase scenes and so forth.  Many copycats have tried, but only failed, with their trite scripts.  Highly reccomended... if you never seen it, rent it now, and wait till the ending!!",Null,0,0,26 February 2002
