Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent
","Brilliant. I saw this late last night with my Dad. I was expecting the usual shoot 'em up thriller but I was pleasantly surprised with the intricate plot; it was something completely different. The best writing since Italian Job and Ocean's Eleven. The plot focuses on details and it is incredibly well thought out. The audience is led in one direction and the outcome is the complete opposite; expect the unexpected. Each member of the cast fits his or her role perfectly. Josh Hartnett masters the role of Sleven. The whole thing is a guessing game. The beginning of the film leaves random loose ends but the smallest of details seem to fall into place by the end of the film. Don't think too hard and don't try to figure it all out in the beginning; it will ruin the enjoyment of the entire film. If you don't catch this movie now, you'll be kicking yourself when you stumble over it in a movie store and have to watch it on your small TV screen. I beg you to pay the $10.50 to see in on the big screen for the full effect. You won't regret it. I assure you.",10,2,9,23 April 2006
