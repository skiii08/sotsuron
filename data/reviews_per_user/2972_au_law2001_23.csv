Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Boy, this is something I'll treasure and remember always.
","Oh, this is the first movie I've seen to have live characters and cartoons come together, maybe not for the first time, I've seen Jerry dance with Gene Kelly once, but that's another movie! Anyways this was my childhood favorite and perhaps an all time, and will always be a favorite to me. Every time I watch there is a magic moment, that the cartoons we all loved as kids are still the best today, even though we are into computer animation, Batman, X-Men, or anime, we can never say we hate those old Looney Toons or Disney shows. And the antics and jokes and gags and gimmicks they did will always remain the funniest, even though we dig jokes from Saturday Night Live or sex jokes these days. This is also the first time I've seen Disney and Warner cartoons for the first time! And not to mention Betty Boop and Droopy! Overall, this is the best animated and live movie the whole family can enjoy, and fans of the old cartoons will love. Recommended to all fans of cartoons of the golden years of Disney and Warner. Thank you Disney, thank you Warner. And if liked this, I recommend you play the video game Kingdom Hearts, this time it's Final Fantasy/Squaresoft and Disney together! >>>> 10/10",10,48,57,7 January 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of a new era.... and a new nightmare...
","I've never seen the original one, but I know that it is the sequel to Night of the Living Dead. 1960's one that is. I find this enjoyable and creepy, a few spoilers, for example, the beginning with the girl coming to the main characters room shocked me, and the way the world is falling apart also gave the creeps, and not to mention, the unforgettable cameo of the original Dawn of the Dead star once again says his famous line from the original,'when there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth', and the part with Mekhi going berserk and his child tuns into a zombie, I swear it gave a few bad dreams! But just a few major problems, zombies don't run, but why did they make them run? That wasn't scary at all, it seemed like a laughable Tales From The Crypt episode to me, in which the crypt keeper would call a 'hack and field' race. BLEH! Or the scenes with the gun shop owner on the roof, and the ending was a lame Blair Witch rip-off. That's not the worst part. Where are the bikers? The original was said to have a gang, where are they? I didn't see any of them. Despite all these flaws, I recommend this to people who are hard core fans of the Dead trilogy, which I believe will no longer be a trilogy, for Romero seems to be making another Dead movie. Oh these days, remake happy days. Lost In Space, The Mummy, Charlie's Angels, Starsky And Hutch, Psycho, The Grudge, what's next?",9,0,1,7 December 2004
Shaun of the Dead," It knocked me dead!
","A very funny British comedy and funny parody of the Dead Trilogy. It's unlike Scary Movie or Student Bodies but it is funny nonetheless. The title itself is a pun on Dawn Of The Dead, the film is about an average English worker who is trying to get his girlfriend back and making things right with his parents, until for some unknown reason, the dead begin to walk the earth, and Shaun together with his buddy Ed decide to find their friends and Shaun's mom and girlfriend and get them to safety. It had many funny moments, like the day it started, Shaun and Ed are very oblivious despite news broadcasts that the dead are taking over, and the part when they pretend to be zombies just so they can get past them. The film itself became very impressive to everyone including George Romero himself! I haven't such hilarious stuff like this since Student Bodies. Now, the guys behind this film, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are now given cameos(possibly zombie cameos) on Romero's forth upcoming film of the Dead movies(they should've brought Nick Frost in it). Jolly good show you two, see you in Land Of The Dead!",9,2,4,30 March 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Hey Mr. Garrison, ever read the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe?
","No? Neither have I, after hearing about this from my friend, I wondered what it would be like, if it might be just another overrated blockbuster, or if it was going to be good, well, I must admit I enjoyed, even though I found the earlier parts boring, but because I decided to stay, I was able to be more open minded to it, more attentive and decided to give it a chance, and it really is a true masterpiece, enough for the whole family to enjoy, it was colorful, dramatic, full of suspense and action of the LOTR variety, and it was mesmerizing, an eye candy and a wonderful story and lessons about working together, and trust, and who said anything about Christianity? As a Christian I didn't see anything about it, except for the reference to Genesis, but that didn't explain anything to me, sorry to say that, but that's just how I see it. My only complaint is the release date here, because it had a reference to Christmas, if it was released in December, it would have made more sense, but that's just me, it didn't matter to anyone else and it didn't make it bad, it was good either way. But I really have to read the books to know more of it, so must everyone else who enjoyed to feel the magic of it, or maybe they already did, hope they did. Anyways recommended to the whole family, if I did read the book, and did a report on it, I would give it a good review, and A, sorry Cartman, you get an F, I did not find this camel you said, I don't know what you were reading.",10,0,2,18 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," He's back! He's the man behind the mask!
","No it's not Jason, I mean Spidey, or Spider Man! And he's for real. WARNING Several Spoilers ahead, read at thy risk if ye has not yet seen. This shows two years after the original, it shows what Peter Parker does after the first, how he's adjusting to being a normal person and super hero at the same time, but he has problems, it's hard to do both at the same time. He gets late for class, he doesn't see Mary Jane often, and he hasn't made much money from his previous jobs, and couldn't meet deadlines. He's in some sort of dilemma, he seems to be losing his powers little by little, and his friend is losing it after the death of his father, and vows vengeance, and he's losing Mary Jane as well. It seems that Pete has a lot of responsibility after all with the power he's got. And now he has to stop Doc Ock/ Dr. Octopus from trying to continue his plans. This has got to be a great and most promising sequels to be seen, especially from a Marvel movie. It's great. This ain't no disappointment and the ending is cool, and after stopping Doc Ock, it's not the end of troubles. It has room for another sequel, can't wait for that! That makes it another success for Marvel, next to X-Men, X-Men 2 and Blade and Blade II. Oh, and be sure to spot Stan Lee, he's somewhere in this film. And don't forget the unforgettable soundtrack by Michael Buble, and I agree, it is worthy of an Oscar. Watch it, you know you wanna.",Null,1,2,25 December 2004
Finding Nemo," Whoa...
","A beautiful CG movie, what more can I say? Fishy but good, it begins with Marlin a clown fish, and he takes care of his son, but ends being captured, and now he has to find him, with this fish that always and always forgets. Nemo, the son, of course ends up in a Dentist's clinic and gets acquainted with other fish and a bird down under. Overall an excellent animated film with colorful characters, and great CG, heart warming, very funny and well, did I mention great CG? I like especially the part with the sharks who keep getting tempted to eat them, and the one with turtles is cool, and the funniest scene has to be in the Dentist clinic in the middle of the movie, check it out. Recommended to the whole family, and animation fans everywhere, and to those who liked Shrek and Toy Story.",8,0,2,14 January 2005
The Mummy," It's more of an Indiana Jones look alike, but worth viewing
","This is more of action and adventure than of horror. This is supposed to be a remake of the original 1930s version. Well some things are the same, Imhotep is in it, and his scheme is also there, but there are many changes, I mean many! The special effects, the 10 plagues that follow when Imhotep comes back to life, different other characters, a comic relief, more action, and a body count. It lacks what the original one was, it was too in your face, and tongue in cheek. But Despite all those, the changes made it better and attracted quite an audience I must say. And I like the brother Jonathan who is a greedy man and a coward, and the other guy who is like him, Beni, who is also greedy and a coward, it made me want to watch this even more. Oh yeah, and it is also set in the 1930s, that's a good thing. Recommended to those who want to see adventure action, fast paced movies.",7,0,1,15 January 2005
The Terminator," Before Titanic, before he became governor...
","This has got to be one of the best sci fi films ever made, and possibly the most influential ever! And not to mention one of the milestones and pop cultural phenomenal sensations of the 1980s, and perhaps one of James Cameron's best work, and to the say the least, the movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star, and this is perhaps the most memorable role and most recognizable role yet. And Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen and Dick Miller were also good here too, even though their roles were short(may Winfield rest in peace). Even though there were no special effects or CGI(they used stop motion instead. Oh those were the days) but you got to love this, once you've watched it, you'll fall in love with it and would want to watch it over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again and again and again, oh I'll stop right there. Recommended for all Sci Fi fans, James Cameron fans, and Arnie fans. Be sure to watch the sequels too!",10,2,3,31 January 2005
Lost in Translation," I felt lost also and still do!
","Just saw it a few days ago, it was okay. It's not one of those typical love stories, it's about two people who are listless and can't find meaning in their lives and find it harder because they are in a foreign country and can't catch with the culture and language, but you can't blame them, and they meet each other, and make a relationship with each other, even though they each have a spouse they keep seeing each other but don't do it or anything like that. And the title itself does not refer to the language barrier itself, it means that the two are lost in translating the meaning in their lives even though they are very successful, and very good, they still feel an emptiness inside of them. Overall it's okay, could be a bit boring but an okay story nonetheless and I feel I can relate to it because I too found my language hard because I grew up in America and I felt I couldn't find my place here because I don't really get the culture, and I liked because I am a Bill Murray fan, he was great in it even though it wasn't a funny one.",5,0,1,14 May 2005
Resident Evil," Not very much of a good adaption of the game, but impressive and good to see.
","Well after the waiting, we finally get a Resident Evil movie at last, but not in the way we expected it to be. Sure, normally it would not be directly based on the games, so they would put something else instead to make it worthwhile to see. But what we get is something a little disappointing. It seems to tell a bit of a sensationalized story instead of the on in the game, and it seems to lack a bit of the horror and fun from the games, at least it still has the T-virus, I'm glad and thankful for that. And there are some STARS in it, and zombies, and dog zombies, and lickers, but it lacks the feel, it doesn't seem all that exciting, more of a generic zombie movie, doesn't even surpass the Dead trilogy. In other word it just doesn't have the spirit of the games. But despite all that, it's good to see it isn't like the other failed movies from video games, like Street Fighter, or Super Mario Bros, or Double Dragon, yuck! It had creepy monsters and a shocking ending, so they are forgiven. But still, I wish it was Romero, instead of Anderson, I believe it would have captured the feel of the games. >>> 5.5/10",6,0,0,7 January 2005
The Pianist," A great blend of emotions, depicting the horrors and nature of the Holocaust
","An excellent film about a musician making his way through the holocaust, and great and convincing acting by Adrien Brody, an excellent blend of emotions depicting the harshness that the Jews went through those times. I must admit Roman Polanski did a very good job showing us the misery and suffering of Poland during the days of Hitler, the holocaust and the horrible inhumane things they did to them, which could shock you and make you sympathize the people in it. Adrien plays a pianist who is very successful in Poland but during the outbreak of the Second World War, however, he becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Nazis. By the start of the 1940s, he goes from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, then into a forced German Labor Compound. Overall, a true work of art, and a compelling movie which would make you cry and sympathize the people, seeing how they were killed, and you would enjoy it too, great work of Polanski despite his past, which I will not discuss. Recommended to those who like dramatic movies about WWII and others.",10,0,2,21 July 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," I still say they should've sticked with Romero's version
","I've seen this recently and I must say it was a bit of an improvement but not that good, because was too much action and face-paced thriller than horror, at least they put a few lickers, and perhaps the only things I found worthwhile in this movie is that it had some characters similar to the ones in the game, it had Nemesis(except he also had a chain-gun), and it had Jill Valentinte, Carlos, Nikolai, but Ashford was a bit different. And at least Nemesis was almost the same as he was in the game, but my complaints are also that Nemesis was a bit of the hero at the end and that other STARS members like Chris, Barry, Rebecca, Brad, and Wesker weren't in it, and there weren't enough monsters and they didn't deliver enough fear. But overall it was okay as a sequel but lousy as an adaption and horror.",5,1,2,22 April 2005
Caddyshack," Classic Bill Murray and classic Chevy Chase, and not to mention classic Harold Ramis
","This has got to be another funny and classic masterpiece of the two Ghostbusters Bill and Harold. Man and perhaps the most recognizable movie of the 80s with perhaps a funny dialogue, and scenes especially the ones with Rodney Dangerfield(may God rest his soul) I like especially the part when he wrecks the other guys boat and drops his anchor on his and says 'hey! You scratched my anchor!' Ha ha ha ha! I love that part and not to mention the part with the candy bar, when it went into the pool, everyone went running out thinking it's crap. That is something I'll never forget. I like it also when Bill's character eats it and the rich guys lady faints. And no to mention the scene with the crazy golfer who keeps winning every game he does, until he looses one, and gets struck by lightning, and Bill just leaves him there, another memorable scene. The ones with the gopher was okay.... to say the least, it was funny, but not as funny as the scenes with Bill. Recommended to all fans of Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, and Chevy Chase, and Rodney Dangerfield. Watch it, you know you want to.",9,2,4,31 January 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Johnny Depp never performed so sweet
","In this version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I must say that Tim Burton did an okay job in adapting it to a new generation, though, I believe Johnny Depp's acting as Willy Wonka, was a little too exaggerated, I mean he acted a little weird, especially at the ending, but I must say it was clever, and he looked cool, the hat and the hair, he looked Marilyn Manson a bit, and he was really inspired by his look too. And I liked the way he spoke also, especially when he was reading the cards, and when he keeps getting flashbacks, especially when he remembers his dad, I liked that part. And I must say the umpa lumpas(not sure if that's how it's spelled) were very cool, and I liked their songs. Overall a nice movie, but another remake, but it is not one of those bad ones, but still, this has to be one of the most promising movies out there, and this being a Tim Burton film, most of his films are amazing.",8,3,4,11 August 2005
The Great Raid," Forget Pearl Harbor, this is THE war movie.
","My brother was the first one to talk about this, I wasn't sure what to think so I decided to look out for it. Last week, I went into the mall, I saw this being advertised, and hearing it is a war movie, I decided to check it out. I missed the first credits, but that didn't really matter, about the film, I must say this was a very decent movie unlike the ones which were released the same day, it lived up to it's title and story, it was based on a book, what do ya know? Anyways back to the film, it tells the true story of the 6th Ranger Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci who undertake a daring rescue mission against all odds. Traveling thirty miles behind enemy lines, the 6th Ranger Battalion aims to liberate over 500 American prisoners-of-war from the notorious Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp in the most audacious rescue ever, and audacious it sure was! The fight scenes were kinda impressive, and the scenes with the underground organization were okay, it showed accurately how the Japanese treated our people here during that time. Overall an impressive film, and Cesar Montano was convincing as a the captain of the Philippine forces and he did his role well. Recommended to all movie goers who would like to know about WWII in the Pacific, especially to the people of my city, and especially the Japanese people, even though others there might not get it, others would, at least it is more accurate, true, and this time it got the mark, unlike Pearl Harbor. But one more thing bothers me, why was this pushed back indefinitely by Miramax a few years ago? Was it because they wanted it to be in line with films 60 years after the war ended, or was it because of the war in Iraq? I hope the war in Iraq is not the reason, because this film is about World War 2.",10,4,6,1 September 2005
Pulp Fiction," Fast paced, wacky, and cool!
","One of the best films out there, and one of the films that made Quentin famous, Pulp Fiction is one of those films that are thrilling and clever, that it makes you want to see it again and again. Though, it is non linear and it is more of a character based movie, it remained solid and entertaining, you see that the criminals or assassins are more than just interesting and cool. The dance scene was kinda funny, it was good to see Travolta dancin again, though not from the way he used to, and I liked also the scene where they try to inject Uma's character, and when she got up, that was amazing. I liked also the segment of the watch, the one with Bruce Willis. When he bumped into Ving Rhames' character, that was cool, and I also liked how they got back at the cop and store owner, and I must say Sam Jackson's character was very strange, but still, he was great and convincing in his character. Definitely a must see for those who love fast paced movies, and those who love Quentin Tarantino's work.",9,1,2,19 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Mixed signals
","As a fan of the classic movie and the novel, I must say this film, was worth my money. It was different, but the important parts of the original story, that's where it was faithful, though it seemed a bit plot less, but it had one. Here's my analogy of the film:How it remained faithful(spoilers ahead): 1.The narration at the beginning, the only thing that changed was the year, instead the narrator says 21st century, but hey, it took place in our time right? 2.The way the aliens came, not through flying saucers.3.The structure of the ships, they were pods with tentacles, that tore down buildings, used blood from humans, and shot heat rays, and they didn't use flying spaceships, or saucers.4.The three escaped into the country side.5.The military fought hard but it was in vain.6.There was a scene where they escaped to the sea though a ship.7. How they were stopped. Changes: 1.The story focused on a family, the Ferriers and not a scientist.2.The way the aliens came, instead of a cylinder, it was lightning.3.There were no reports about invasions, just storms.4.No fight at sea.Despite these changes, I must say that this was a very promising movie, that is worth checking, and a great performance by the actors, and great return to alien sci fi for Spielberg. But, stop comparing this to Signs, OK? Thank you.",7,7,14,15 July 2005
Ice Age," Cool! Pun intended
","Of all the CG animated shows I've watched, this is the best! Perfect with a decent cast, I love John Leguizamo, as Sid, funny as always, and Jack Black, and Dennis Leary and Ray Romano! What can I say? I love that guy! What am I saying, everybody loves Raymond! Another one intended. It's the story of three prehistoric animals, who find a human baby and try to survive the Ice Age, with hilarious results and total chaos! But hey, it's just them on a journey, it's like Pumba and Timon meets Stand By Me. And not to mention, that squirrel, who with no lines at all, strives to break open this acorn or nut, so it can eat it, it's funny from the beginning to end. Unforgettable and very touching, and leaves you warm inside for a cool show, another one intended! Recommended for the whole family, and for those who love The Lion King, Stand By Me, and Shrek and for everybody that loves Raymond! >>>>9/10",9,1,4,31 December 2004
Speed," The Bus That Could Never Slow Down
","This 'Speed' movie about a 'Speed' bus that should have a lot of 'Speed' so they don't get blown up. Okay enough of that. This is a very excellent and exciting thriller, and great acting alive with emotion. And may I say a decent cast, wow. A lot of hot stars in this one. An unforgettable role of Keanu Reeves way back before he starred in The Matrix, and great acting too. And not to mention Sandra Bullock of While You Were Sleeping, Ms. Congeniality, A Time To Kill and many others. And not to say the least, the villain Dennis Hopper. His acting is very solid and captivating, and he is very convincing as the bad guy. I especially like the part when he tell them about bombs. 'Bombs must blow, if they don't they're not bombs, they're gold watches.' That was cool. And the way they get the hostages out is amazing and cliffhanging, and full of suspense, find out yourself, you'll find it cool. Recommended to all fans of action, adventure thrillers and to those who love Dennis Hopper.",9,2,4,15 January 2005
The Matrix," One of the best movies at the end of the 20th century. The Future is here.
","Back when people feared the Y2k virus and when people thought the world were to end, and others didn't. This came out and put us on the edge of our seats! Yes one of the best movies ever made, and one of the most intriguing sci-fi's to be made, a movie that made Keanu Reeves big. The story is set in modern days, and now, someone finds out the reality they are in is fake, they are but bites in a computer. Wow, an original concept, and a great cast of characters, and not to mention the great special effects! The battle scenes and the unforgettable gun fights, and lets not forget the memorable and very recognizable scene with the slowdowns and Trinity doing that poise. And the bullets the way they move in slow motion, it started it all. And I like especially the part when Neo asked for guns, lots and lots of guns, they all appeared at once in a flash! It's great, recommended to all who like fast paced action and sci-fi. Watch it. You know you want to.",10,3,6,15 January 2005
Sin City," Sinfully delightful
","One of the most shocking, and most intense, thrilling shocker movies, ever made, Sin City does it all, with it's action, and noir like stories in the fictional city, which is full of crime, murder, scandal, prostitutes, corrupt officials, politicians, gun toting, sword wielding women, and a lot of other depraved sickos, and you get to hear each person's side of the story, of the situations of what's on and what's happening in Basin City, especially what's happening in the outskirts of the city, especially the one in the farm, which seems to reminisce the murders of Ed Gynne, and Elijah Wood's character was kick ass! Each scene features black in white, mixed with color in some scenes, with red in the cars, and the blood, though some of the blood is white, perhaps for legal reasons, and also in one of the segments, there is color, and the cars also get different colors. Robert Rodriguez did such a good job in making this adaption onto the big screen, with the help of Quentin Tarantion of Kill Bill/Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs fame! I must admit, this surpasses both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction in terms of plot, and action. Recommended to all who enjoy Rodriguez's films and action films, especially violent ones, and to the fans of the original comics, and I heard there is a sequel in the works, and I feel overwhelmed with joy, hoping it will be as good.",10,0,1,26 July 2005
Cinderella Man," Brilliant film, too bad it never got the credit it deserved.
","An excellent film about the great depression fighter Jim Braddock who started as a poor has been prizefighter because of a broken right arm, and does everything he can for his family, driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. And he kept winning and inspired many people who are suffering under the great depression, because even though he is old and a bit of a has been, he never gave up, and he revived the American Spirit of 'never giving up' to them(which is why he is called the Cinderlla Man). Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring. But I think Max Baer portrayed as that was a little too much, but ya gotta love Craig Bierko's performance. Ron Howard did quite a good job at this, but too bad it didn't sell too well at the box office, this is great stuff here, too bad all the attention went to other overrated blockbusters such as 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Bewitched'. But you gotta give this credit, it is worth watching, great acting and drama, watch this, you'll love it too believe me.",10,1,2,17 September 2005
The Island," Skeptical at first, but then...
","What do you know? It's great, the action, the plot, though not original, it is said to be a remake, but it was a good one, better believe that! It is about a group of naive humans sheltered in this futuristic metropolis after they've been told that the world has been destroyed, and they do labor in the place their in, and there is this lottery, that if they are selected, then they can go to 'The Island', the so-called last paradise on Earth. Until one of them played by Ewan McGregor, discovers that they are actually 'spare parts for rich people in the real world, in short, they are clones, and to the perspective of the scientists who created them, 'what's wrong with killing them? They aren't even real people.' And Licoln Echo Six, together with the winner, played by Scarlett Johansson, escape and try to find a way to end what they are doing to the others. Overall, a very good popcorn flick, with a great action, and a great cast, I loved Djimon's character also, and a great plot, depicting human cloning. Michael Bay did a good job, even though, according to several sources, that he is said that he didn't buy the rights for this, I heard this is a remake of a B-movie called The Clonus Horror, or something, and I heard the director, I think he is named, Robert Fiveson, and he might sue them, but I'm sure they will reach a compromise, my thoughts only! Overall, better than Pearl Harbor! End of a Comment: I forgot about dissing this more than Michael Bay forgot to buy the rights for The Clonus Horror, when he made The Island. I changed my mind about him making movies more than he changed it from being a B-movie, And that's an awful lot there. And now, now I liked this, and the point is: The Island is better than Pearl Harbor and I like it. I need to see it again more like Michael Bay needs a good lawyer if he ever gets sued. I need it more like Ewan McGregor needs a different look, he looked just like Christian, the CLB from Smackdown. And now, all I can think about is seeing this movie again! The Island did not suck and I wish to see it again. Why does Hollywood have to keep on remaking movies? I guess The Island is better than Pearl Harbor, just a little bit more than Fiveson needs to calm down.",7,0,0,3 August 2005
