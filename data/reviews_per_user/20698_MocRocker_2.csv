Mission: Impossible III," Movie was okay
","Well, I just went and saw the midnight showing of MI:III. Started off nicely enough. The gadgets and what not that are used within the movie were pretty cool. I liked how they (filmakers/characters) utilized the cool stuff. A couple of twists and turns in the movie literally and figuratively. Philip Seymour Hoffman did a good job playing a bad guy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was an excellent IMF agent, would like to see him in future MI movies if they do make them. Could have gone better in depth with some of the action sequences as well. I felt there was lacking some intensity with them. Simon Pegg added some good comic relief when needed. And of course the movie depended upon some cheesy lines that made the audience laugh more so than the previous two MI movies. All in all... I rate it a 6 on a scale from 1-10 but a B- on a typical grade scale.",6,6,13,4 May 2006
World Trade Center," WTC--Emotional
","I had the privilege of attending a pre-screening of World Trade Center. I took my girlfriend with me to see it. I knew the actual guys survived the disaster but she did not so it gave us two different perspectives to the movie. This movie made me cry earlier in a movie than any other movie I've seen. The music and the emotional parts were very key and in the right places. World Trade Center did not keep one sad the entire movie, but was done well enough to be emotional when it needed to be. I was wondering how they were going to be found and when. My girlfriend was just hoping they would be found so it made it much more taxing on her emotions than it did mine. World Trade Center is a good movie to learn about some survivors of the tragedy. Also, it was good that it wasn't too political. I was happy about that. Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie and the special features on the DVD will be excellent.",7,4,11,8 August 2006
