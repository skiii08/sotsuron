Requiem for a Dream," There are just some films that stick with you forever...
","This is DEFINITELY one of those films. 'Requiem For A Dream' is next to one other, the best movie I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky has done here what directors like Tarantino and Spielberg have been trying to do for years with their desperate attempts at further greatness with duds like 'Jackie Brown' and 'Munich'. Aronofsky blends this beautiful portrait of the most horrible and savage demon in the world with its equality of cool atmospheric elements, strange string music, strong characters with amazing backgrounds which are shown in the movie, a factor seldom done by filmmakers and the honesty. The raw and harsh honesty that we as humans grow addictions. We're willing to risk anything; our dignity, our health, our pride, our love and friendships to satisfy our addictions. This is such a beautiful film and will probably never gain that reputation by majority because of its harsh reality and storytelling. I write this review, not for the film buff looking for a good unknown film, not for the Ellen Burstyn or Jared Leto fan, but for parents. Parents only. Pleae, parents, if your son or daughter confronts you with this movie, please please please don't be dissuaded by its content or rating or subject matter or whatever. Let your children see this movie. Let them see it before they hit high school. Watch it with them! Talk to them about it before and after. Use it as an example in your talks with them about drugs. Tell them about your past. Talk to them about their future. Tell them the dangers of addiction and to never let any addiction be so strong that it ruins everything around them. This film is graphic. It's harsh. It's brutal. It's disturbing. It's real. It's beautiful. This does deserve just an 'oh, that was a good movie.' It deserves examination and respect and recognition as a living film that will grab your attention and show you the true meaning of what it means to be addicted and how it can ruin you forever. Watch it with your kids and see.",10,1,2,5 February 2006
