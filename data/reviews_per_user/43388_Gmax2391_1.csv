The Avengers," Superhero movies....can be blockbusters, and this movie here set the precedent
","I'm so impressed I will write my first review ever, I have seen the movie three times in four days I could watch it until my eyes dried out, the most anticipated movie of our generation was a success!! How often are movies like this never what the fans were promised? How often do these movies, never live up to the hype? I was skeptical of this movie, but for some reason I had a feeling this movie wouldn't disappoint . Hats off to all the star power, the actors played off each other so well, I was deeply impressed. Mark Ruffalo did a wonder taking over the Bruce Banner role...when Ed Norton left, I wasn't happy however,...Ruffalo did well I want too see him repraise the role. I don't want to say much more, it was great movie, defiantly will be in my top 3 of all time, and I hope it once it comes to DVD I will own said movie....till next time keep it Marvel",10,1,4,4 May 2012
