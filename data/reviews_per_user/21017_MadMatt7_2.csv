The Ring," Best scary movie in a LONG time.
","Buuut, it's obviously not for everyone. I thought 'The Ring' was extremely well made, with great pacing, acting, cinematography, characters, and a suberbly creepy soundtrack. My wife and son were so freaked out by it that they refuse to even be in the room when I watch it - but, then we all have very active imaginations. My brother, on the other hand, and two of the people I work with could not get into it and were not scared in the least, so to each his own. I think the key word with this film is 'subtlety'. If you like horror/suspense movies that scare you with the subtle things you can't see, then 'The Ring' excels. If you want some knife-wielding maniac to jump out at you every 10 minutes, then you will probably be bored and underwhelmed. As far as the 'holes' in the plot, several explanitory scenes were cut from the final film because they disrupted the flow. I still think the movie worked just fine leaving some things unexplained.",10,1,1,21 May 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Only A.D.D. sufferers can follow it.
","Seriously, how could anyone sit through this thing? After 5 minutes of this amphetamine-edited nonsense, I had a splitting headache. This movie could not sit still for one scene to let me catch up to what was going on. Not that I cared, anyway. No one in the film got a chance to even finish a song without the director jumping in and out of it like some hyperactive 3-year old child. Completely unwatchable.",1,5,12,21 May 2003
