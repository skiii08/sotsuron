Skyfall," My Review...Honestly
","Honestly, the movie process was well done...with the exception of the storyline. Acting, very good. Cinematography, excellent. Sound & video editing, very good as well. Set design & location (even Turkey), good too. Costumes were wonderful. Superlative job of selling the movie in advance... However, it's about the play. What happens on camera? How does the story moves along? What emotions are pulled from the audience by the characters? How do the characters develop during the play? With a better story, this would have been a fantastic film! With story given, its a study on how to make a successful film without much of a story. Honestly, I really don't see much of a future for 24 or 25 unless the writing improves. I hope that in the future more work will be done on the story. The process is excellent. But it must begin with story.",5,4,9,14 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Really Well-Done, Tom!
","This what the spy-action genre is supposed to be like. There is not one wasted frame in this film. The photography is beautiful. The locations are visually interesting. But, mainly, it's the story, the story, and the story that drives it. The actors gives believable performances...every one of them...particularly the foreign-born. I guess that equals effective casting. The musical score is great. I applaud especially the orchestrator for a fine job enhancing the film musically. I am positive that the next installment will be on my list as well. Unlike some other franchises, I have no fear of disappointment. The Mission may seem Impossible but great movies can still be made. This one proves it! Good Job!",10,1,2,25 April 2015
Gone Girl," Is this really art?
","I mean really. There are so many pluses in the cast...Affleck, Pike, Sela Ward...how could this one turn out so horrible. Maybe that's what they were trying for...a horror film. A film about the horrible way people treat each other. If that is the case, they succeed immeasurably. However, my question is the same. Why tell this story? Why spend all that money to tell this type of tale? How does this 'story' help make us a better society? There are several subplots that would have been interesting to develop...Nick's father or mother, Amy's mother and father, Nick's sister, anything would have been more interesting than what was given the second half of this movie. And while I'm at it, why so much foul-language? How does this move the story along. You may say, 'Well, that's the way people talk nowadays.' but really, it isn't. It seemed as though the writers went overboard trying to get as many curse words in the movie as possible. I wonder if any curse words made it to the cutting room floor at all! To be absolutely honest, I would like to erase this film from my memory entirely. I sincerely hope that Gone Girl is completely GONE...forever! Such a shame, Rosamunde is such a lovely girl.",2,1,6,21 June 2015
