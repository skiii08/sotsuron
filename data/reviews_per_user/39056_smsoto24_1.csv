Black Swan," Haunting
","A beautiful tragedy, with many complex layers. The passion and pain transcended reality transforming you into the 'Black Swan'. Leaving you longing for a grip on reality. Leaving you as battered, tired, and accomplished as Nina Sayers played by Natalie Portman.The acting was amazing the remaining cast fully support Natalie Portman, in her long journey of becoming the Black Swan. The story is gritty, dark full of passion and mystery. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance, do not be fooled by user reviews that bash the movie, they have missed a master piece and have misinterpreted, the nature of the film.",10,3,6,10 January 2011
