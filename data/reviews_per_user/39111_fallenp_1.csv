The Incredible Hulk," Could have been better
","This movie could have been great but it has two huge issues that hurt it. The story was OK but really now that I think about it almost a retelling of the TV show version with special effects and a equal to fight. 1. Major editing in the middle was botched. Timeline all wrong. Don't know how no one else saw this. Killed the mood and brought me out of the flow of the story. 2. CGI was actually not as good as the Ang Lee version over all. Close up scene were better but action scenes were easy to see as CGI both the Moster and background looked like a comic book page. Iron man did a better job of blending it all together. After watching both the newest and Ang Lee's I have to say the cerebral version is much better and more satisfying. Lastly Camera control. Normally I don't have a problem with camera jerk, I watch a ton of action movies but this is the first movie were I had trouble watching as the camera moved around to much. During the chase scene in the beginning and much of the fight scenes the camera was unsteady like it was a hand-held and would whip around away from the action at times. Very distracting and detracting from the movie.",5,3,7,14 June 2008
