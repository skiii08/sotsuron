The Devil's Advocate," EXCELLENT PREMISE BUT
",The Devil is the head of a large law firm. Don't we all know that? A young promising attorney seems to be on the brink of selling his soul to join the firm. This would work as a serious drama and maybe it could as a comedy but the casting of Keanu Reeves in the lead ruins any chance that it could make it either way. Reeves like Kyle McGlaughin is a wonderful android as far as his range as an actor goes. His emotionless script reading could let him play a good accountant or maybe he could do a parody of himself in the future if they ever revive Leslie Neilson's comedy roles. But for now his presence and DeNiro's tendency to overact ruin what is a good screen play. The ending is also too predictable and a wonderful plot is wasted.,6,1,2,27 April 2002
Requiem for a Dream," FOR REHAB PATIENTS ONLY
","This is not a film but rather a very frightening story of drug addiction and abuse as experienced by four different personalities in today's Coney Island. Not a pleasurable experience and none of the characterizations evoke much sympathy except Burstyn. There is no development of the addictions here as in 'Lost Weekend', 'Days of Wine and Roses' or others of that nature. These people are hooked when we meet them and it doesn't get any better.",5,0,1,21 April 2002
Training Day," DENZEL CAN BE A VERY GOOD BAD GUY TOO
","This is a combination of Prince of the City, Serpico and Colors rolled into one. Hawke plays a young who transfers to a narcotics squad headed by Washington in order to speed up his chances for promotion.It turns out that Washington is 'dirty' and we have to see just how far Hawke will go for the promotion. Very good minor roles by Glenn and Berenger help this along. Good action and acting.Washington deservedly won the Academy Award for this but Hawke almost steals the show.",7,1,11,30 March 2002
Memento," Overrated
","The story of two different characters who lose their memory and have no recollection of the previous day each time they wake. Our hero, Pearce, survives by taking notes on the back of polaroids and tatooing important facts on his body. The story is well told and Pearce and the rest of the cast do OK, but basically this is only a 1/2 hour Twilight Zone that would have been better if Rod Sterling had produced it.Save your money and wait until this hits Showtime or HBO.",3,3,5,2 March 2002
Insomnia," GREAT START BUT FALLS QUICKLY
","Wonderful start for this drama about a hardened homicide detective, with an Internal Affairs investigation hanging over him, and his partner being loaned to an small town Alaska police force to help solve the mysterious murder of a young woman. However, the film starts to go downhill shortly after we learn the detective's secret and he subsequently kills his partner, who is going to testify against him. The killing may or may not be accidental and we are now thrust into the detective's guilt trip over the circumstances and his implausible 'strange bedfellow' agreement with the young woman's killer. No real mystery here and the good acting is overshadowed by too many holes in the plot but still entertaining and a good watch if you don't have high hopes.",6,0,0,25 October 2002
The Thing," JOHN CARPENTERS'S FINEST
","Far and way the best 'Thing' that John Carpenter has ever produced. This bears no resemblance to the late 40s classic which featured James Arness as a dangerous, alien vegetable in the Arctic. Rather it is a modern version of the the original 1930's novella and follows its story line extremely well but for the likewise modern, but more cynical ending.A combo of science fiction and horror that is very frightening and could be thought of as plausible if you have an imagination and enjoy this genre.The cast led by Kurt Russell does a marvelous job and the screenplay is excellent altho some might be offended by some excessive profanity in the original release. It is a great watch and a must for fans of genre.",8,1,2,25 October 2002
The Thing," EXCELLENT, CARPENTER'S BEST
",This is supposedly a remake of the 40's classic which feature James Arness as a huge alien vegetable terrorizing an Arctic expedition. Actually it turns out to be a much more faithful rendering of James Campbell's science fiction novella from the 30s without the happy ending. Kurt Russell and crew are part of Antarctic expedition which come across the wreck of an alien craft. That part follows the original movie but the monster is not a vegetable but a 'shape changing' creature who can invade the body of Russell or any of the men. The language is awfully strong so parental guidance should be used but this is an very frightening and suspenseful film that doesn't need or get Carpenter's usual gore. Well worth the watch and a must for fans of the genre. Get the video and do NOT watch this with commercial interruption.,8,0,1,12 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," CONVOLUTED BUT COMPELLING
","If you appreciate good cinematography, direction and like to drift into dreams this is the movie for you. It is confusing and convoluted but compelling. The movie should be seen in the theater to appreciate the beauty of the filming but you have to rent it later if you hope to make any sense of it.Part of the problem yet an incredibly unique idea is having the cast play different roles in what are sometimes dream sequences, sometimes flashbacks and sometimes just the regular story. Which by the way isn't really that much. The two leads are involved in a lesbian relationship which Watts takes more seriously and gets dumped when Harring gets to be full fledged star. So naturally she hires a hit man to kill her ex-lover and the film actually starts with the botched attempt on Harring's life.Then the dreams and flashbacks come along with the audience left to figure out what order they belong in.I've heard Lynch described as surrealistic by some while others say he just clips portions of a movie together in any sequence to seem 'artsy'.
I don't know the answer to that but I have to say Lynch is consistently confusing and this film is typical of his work but certainly superior to the vastly overrated 'Blue Velvet'/I gave this 7 out 10 bearing in mind that it should be seen twice or more. 2 1/2 out 4 if you are at the theater and don't want to bother.",7,0,0,13 April 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," WITTY AND MORE
",Brilliantly funny satire about inept gangsters at different levels contriving schemes to rip off one another without knowing exactly what they are doing and to whom.Reminiscent of the great 50s and early 60s British comedies that feature Alistair Sims and Peter Sellers in their early days.Problem is that since the Beatles disappeared and Americans have become infatuated with 'Ebonics' and 'Spanglish' much of dialetic humor or British slang needs to be replayed on the video for most of us to really appreciate it.If you liked 'Snatch' and are quick and sober when you watch this you will laugh your 'tush' off. Many would appreciate 'subtitles' though.,8,1,1,14 November 2002
The Deer Hunter," THE DIRECTOR MISSED HIS OWN POINT
","This movie became popular and vastly overrated because most viewers thought it was the first time that Vietnam had been put in the perspective of actual American soldiers and not politicians.Well it tries but then loses itself because of unrealism and I'm not talking about the combat scenes.The idea of showing an American deer hunter transposed into an entirely foreign land faced with 'trip mines', 'boobytraps' and a totally unknown enemy is what this started to be. But we have Robert DeNiro with his full beard parading around as some kind of typical American when no draftee was allowed facial hair unless he had a skin desease. That sort of takes some of the realism out of it from the 'get-go'. Then we have the 'russian roulette' game that was only rumored about at the time and just adds a nauseating aspect to the film.The acting is fine and the helicopter scenes amidst the elephant grass are realistic but the director lost touch with the theme.We were not the evil large civilized force picking on the poor ragged asian minorities. We were ill-trained foreigners invading a foreign country, ill equipped and not trained to fight foreign soldiers on their own turf, who would have slaughtered us without the benefit of our air support.This film was nothing more than a try to show that American soldiers were not just 'baby killers' as so many of the anti-war protesters of the time claimed. We were people too but the movie misses badly.This does not even resemble the magnificent film 'Platoon' or even come close to the vastly underrated 'Go Tell the Spartans' with Burt Lancaster.Over publicized garbage akin to the 'The Green Berets' only with better acting.** Stars out of 6, because of the acting and cinematography.",5,3,8,29 July 2001
