The Equalizer," Russians = Evil!!! Americans = Awesome!
","Seriously, this is a film for young kids who still believe in superheroes and fairy tales, otherwise, you have to be a little dimwitted to actually like to this film.Let me start off by saying that the film is stylish, and had a lot of potential, however the scenes and storyline are really awful and quickly bring this film down to the gutter!
It's your typical, evil incompetent Russians vs the righteous American hero cliché.
You literally know everything that is about to happen. This is all well and good if it was a comedy or Arnie film, but we are expected to take this film seriously!To sum it up, lame, cliché, unoriginal.
Bring your flag, and leave your brain at the door when you watch this film.",2,12,22,21 December 2014
Gravity," Lame & unoriginal
","This film is basically an unoriginal cliché set in space. Its tiring to watch. It is filled with over dramatized, unbelievable events and make it very hard to believe or immerse yourself. The drama is very forced and i found it not only annoying but an insult to my intelligence. Firstly, blaming the Russians for all the 'bad' that goes on in the world is really tiresome and very over done. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone is a typical cliché, she is a scarred individual with a tear jerking past who we are supposed to relate to and sympathize with. Yawn!! George Clooney is your typical brave, funny, all American hero that we all wish we were and is truly heroic and selfless in death. ZZZZZZZ Then we are supposed to believe that Bullock's inept character, who is the weaker of the 2, somehow survives a series of incredible and impossible events by sheer dumb luck and the good'ol American spirit? Im not going to go into details about Bullock escaping the exploding space station and avoiding the millions of pieces of space debris or fumbling through Russian and Chinese space craft to magically re-enter earths orbit only to survive another near death experience to then crawl on a picturesque beach. The visuals are great, but thats about it. The film is a giant disappointment. The many positive reviews its received make me only believe that the human race is filled with morons who need to be sterilized.",2,24,42,15 November 2013
The Descent," Dumb cave creature's - Yawn!!
","I don't know what all the 'hype' is about. Are people so easily pleased? This film is neither interesting nor scary, its boring, annoying and poorly written.Firstly, the all female cast have poor chemistry and uninteresting dialog. Their 'fun times' in the cabin seem forced, fake and slow, mixed in with cheap, pop out scares, however i had little invested in the characters and i found myself waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen. Secondly, the cave creature were unimaginative, unoriginal and stupid. They looked like a cheap and angry imitation of Gollum from LOTR. Apparently these creatures cannot see, hear or smell. They function totally by sonar. They also haven't evolved to use tools or weapons and can be beaten up and killed by humans. Not very scary or smart. It also make me wonder, how do these creatures actually survive underground and hunt/gather food? We see a lot of bones from dead animals, but these creatures are not smart, cunning, powerful or fast. The ending was OK, and probably the best part of the film, but it wasn't enough. Annoying, dumb and boring. Give is a miss.",1,1,4,22 May 2015
Arrival," Pretentious Garbage!
","This piece of cinematic trash has absolutely no redeeming qualities what so ever. Its unimaginative, unoriginal, stupid, and worst of all, its BORING!Nothing is relieved, nothing is explained and the story line is stupid and full of holes! The film basically ends where its starts.The alien 'squids' have the ability and intelligence to travel halfway around the universe/Galaxy (we never know) and can predict the future, transcend space and time, but some how, they are unable to communicate with us primitive humans, except through some bizarre form of symbols which they spray into a glass panel, and the US linguist, Louise, is somehow able to translate this within an amazingly short period of time (how, we never know)Ian, the theoretical physicist, is a total waste of space and contributes nothing to the film apart from being Louise's future breeding partner for producing a child. Yes, its that pathetic and emotionless.The 'film' attempts to convey meaning and emotion with Louise having constant flashes of a daughter she is yet to have. But this is nothing more then pretentious rubbish and is just plain boring!!The characters in the film are uninteresting. Never did i feel a connection or interest. They are just dull as cardboard.In the end the aliens leave.... that's it, and the credits roll. No answers, no resolutions, NOTHING!I have no idea how this 'film' has such a high approval rate or what the appeal is.On a scientific level, it offers nothing. Story line, it goes nowhere. Suspense, drama, entertainment, non-existent!The only good thing about this film was that it cured my insomnia.Arrival = total garbage!",1,10,18,3 February 2017
13 Hours," America...F#*k Yeah!!
","This film is an embarrassing orgy of American glory and awesomeness!!
Our American heroes should all be wearing halos and wings as they bravely battle evil terrorist hordes against impossible odds!Our heroes all have hearts of gold, are totally dedicated to god, family, country and spreading love and democracy to the filthy 3rd world peasants, one bullet at a time. They are also super smart, super skilled, with super model good looks and ripped bodies. In other words, just your average American!!!It would have been perfect if Arnie and Segal were in it :-(I really thought that these obnoxious and simplistic films died in the 80s, but 13 hours proves that this kind rubbish is alive and kicking!!",2,13,36,21 November 2016
