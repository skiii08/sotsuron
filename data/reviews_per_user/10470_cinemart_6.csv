Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," High Five!
","I came into BORAT fairly unfamiliar with the work of Sacha Baron Cohen. I had downloaded a few 'Ali G' clips but had never experienced Cohen's other characters. I was delighted to make Borat's acquaintance. The host of a wildly popular show on Kazakhstan TV, Borat acts as a cultural ambassador when he and his producer, Azamat (Ken Davitian) land on American soil, determined to document this strange country for his government's glorious cultural ministry. All goes well as Borat takes a course in understanding American humor and interviews a group of feminists but when he discovers the beauty that America has to offer in the form of C.J. Parker / Pamela Anderson; he begins an errant quest to make her his wife. High five!The humor of BORAT is one not of cultural snobbishness where we mock a 'fish out of Kazakhstan water' protagonist but where the fish is making fun of the waters he's in. Poking fun at rednecks, fratboys, fundamentalists, and gun nuts (among others), no one is safe from his cockeyed observations and probing questions. Some patrons of the earlier BORAT screenings admitted to feeling guilty for laughing at parts of BORAT. I imagine that the rampant political incorrectness of Borat's 'culture' has and will make some viewers squeamish (with some to the point of being incensed) but I always admire comedy that plays against conventions in a smart, funny way. BORAT does this.Laughing to the point of hyperventilating, I haven't had so much fun at a film since SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, UNCUT.",9,5,14,11 September 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Another great del Toro
","There are terrifying moments as we witness the fated journey of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) but the true horrors in Guillermo del Toro's film stem from the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi López), her stepfather. Austere, severe, he holds few people dear with the possible exception of his unborn son. Captain Vidal is determined to root out the communist rebel fighters who hide in the ancient forest and hills surrounding his country base of operations. Yet, the Captain's own servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) and personal physician (Álex Angulo) are in league with the fighters. In her own way, Ofelia is helping them too as she keeps Mercedes' secret.Added to this riveting war drama is a good dose of magic and magical realism as Ofelia finds the fairies of the forest and learns that she must make several sojourns to the underworld in order to claim her rightful place as heir to the Underworld. At times, it feels like there should be more of this story but it's more of a longing to see the fantastico. If the pattern holds, we can expect a few Hollywood films (some good, some bad) from del Toro before he does another smaller Spanish language film set in wartime with overtones of horror/fantasy again. That future film along with THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE and PAN'S LABYRINTH will be dubbed 'Guillermo del Toro's Somethingerother Trilogy' and sold as a box set of DVDs. Look for it at your local Target store.",9,3,7,11 September 2006
The Illusionist," It's subtle and keeps the story from lurching into something too big for its britches
","Based on Steven Millhauser's short story, Eisenheim the Illusionist, this beautifully shot period piece is fairly hokey and completely predictable. That said, I still had a lot of fun watching it come together.It's a typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story with Edward Norton as Eisenheim, a sleight of hand artist, who falls for the wrong dame, Sophie (Jessica Beal sporting some big choppers and a nice plump heinie in the final shot). She's an aristocrat, way out of his poor boy league. The two are separated by the powers that be, only to be reunited years later when Eisenheim becomes the toast of Vienna and Sophie attends one of his gigs with her almost fiancé Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell doing the darndest Jude-Law-with-ridiculous-mustache impersonation I've ever seen). Also on the scene is Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector Uhl. He's doing his best to maintain law and order while also favoring the Crown Prince in hopes of political advancement.There's lots of intrigue with more than enough special effects to go around. Luckily, Eisenheim's illusions are all flash bang wowzer stuff. It's subtle and keeps the story from lurching into something too big for its britches. This is a little film and, rightly, the tricks are small as well. I enjoyed the old time look of the film (the center of the picture is very clear while the edges seem soft and there is a distinct flicker to some flashback scenes) and was able to overlook the odd 'we're in a foreign country so let's all have English accents' staple.",7,1,1,8 September 2006
Grindhouse," 10 Stars for Rodriguez, Roth, Winter, and Zombie.
","Two feature films plus a handful of trailers for a three-hour extravaganza of entertainment sounds like a great idea, and it is. I loved the overall experience; the bad splices, the damaged prints, the old school ratings animations. That all worked. So did Robert Rodriguez's film, PLANET TERROR. This gore-infested zombie film is a real hoot. It stars 'Six Feet Under' undertaker Freddy RodrÃ­guez as 'El Wray,' a man with a wrecker and a past. He encounters a luscious figure from his past at the local BBQ joint when he meets up with Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), a Go-Go Dancer who once had a dream of being a doctor.PLANET TERROR is brimming with interesting characters who are certainly archetypes but fun archetypes. Two of my favorites include a craggy Michael Biehn as the crusty small town sheriff who's been on the outs with this brother, Jeff Fahey, for years over his secret bar-b-que recipe. Along with this familial conflict, there's political intrigue, medical drama, crazy babysitters, and blazing gunfights. The whole thing is set to an all-too-familiar score reminiscent of John Carpenter. In fact, quite a bit of the film plays like a Carpenter/Romero lovechild. Think ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 meets DAY OF THE DEAD.On the other end of the spectrum from this rip-roaring blast of action is the second feature of GRINDHOUSE, Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF. Essentially, this film is comprised of dialog. It's one scene after another of two groups of girlfriends talking about a whole lot of nothing. It's basically a movie version 'The View' with more pot, drinking, and swearing. Kurt Russell is also there as Stuntman Mike. He hangs out in the background for most of the film, only really having two scenes that count in this tedious and talky exercise that would make MY DINNER WITH ANDRE look like an actionfest.The script to DEATH PROOF explains far more than ended up on screen but neither version gives a whole lot of motivation for why Stuntman Mike terrorizes women with his tricked-out car. The movie of DEATH PROOF holds confusion here and even in its timeline. Knowing that director Tarantino likes to muck about with time (DEATH PROOF is set after PLANET TERROR), some have proposed that the second half of DEATH PROOF comes before the first half chronologically. This is done in an attempt to explain Stuntman Mike's scar, cool attitude, plastic car cage, and bloodlust. Otherwise, audiences are denied any of these and can't identify with anyone in the film, even its psychotic killer main character.Every film fan knows what they can expect from a Quentin Tarantino film: pop culture-laden dialog, backgrounds festooned with movie posters, other films' soundtracks on the soundtrack, and bare (women's) feet. DEATH PROOF has these in spades. However, this time Tarantino just doesn't seem to have either the formula right or perhaps the spark that typically brings it all to life. One would think that having this ample opportunity to pilfer and emulate classic exploitation films would have provided Tarantino with inspiration to make his grindhouse tale an unstoppable homage. Instead, he seems to have been shackled to ceaseless scenes of girls chatting.Sure, the girls chat about movies, too. They refer to VANISHING POINT, CANNONBALL RUN, DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY, GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, and others (for more on these films see 'The Chase Is On from Cashiers du Cinemart #11) but DEATH PROOF comes nowhere near the excitement of any of these films. With no offense meant to David Lynch's film but THE STRAIGHT STORY moves faster than DEATH PROOF.Another odd thing about DEATH PROOF is the lack of 'print damage' when compared to PLANET TERROR and the four fake previews. There's some minor mangling of the print near the beginning of the film but it quickly disappears, not to appear even around reel changes. There's one moment where the film utilizes a conceit that there's a reel missing from DEATH PROOF. This is done, apparently, only to avoid the awkward scene of Butterfly (Vanessa Ferlito) giving Stuntman Mike a lapdance. This same 'Reels Missing' trick was used in PLANET TERROR as well, but used entirely differently. In Rodriguez's film the missing reel contains a wealth of action sequences that other characters elude to, effectively winking at the audience and counting on them to be smart enough to get the joke.In short, if you haven't seen GRINDHOUSE yet do yourself a favor and leave after the preview for Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING. By that point you've gotten all of the entertainment you're going to get our of GRINDHOUSE.",5,11,21,8 April 2007
The Fountain," Will Divide Audiences
","When I read the script for THE FOUNTAIN in late 2005, I found it to be a fairly low calorie film. There's the central conceit of two characters named Thomas and Isabel who share a love that stretches across time and space but, otherwise, it was something of a one trick pony. Three tales of Thomas (Hugh Jackman) and Isabel (Rachel Weisz) are branches of the same (literal) tree.Tomas and Isabel are a conquistador and Queen of Spain. The loyal Tomas journeys to Central America on the quest to locate the Tree of Life; cutting his way through as many Mayans as it takes to get there. The central Thomas, a doctor, appears to have access to part of the Tree which he uses on terminally ill monkeys in hopes of curing his terminally ill writer wife, Izzy. The third Thomas may or may not be a later version of the second. This one floats in a bubble through space with his 'giving tree' of a wife. He's headed to Xibalba (not to be confused with Three Dog Night's 'Shambala'), the Mayan underworld - a place of redemption and rebirth. The stories wind and wander around each other like wild vines. Dialogue and images echo one another throughout the ages. The past and future may simply be the different writings of Isabel and Thomas who begin and end a story called 'The Fountain.' My expectations were incredibly low for this film between the script and the last experience I had watching a film starring a tree (Kiyoshi Kurosawa's CHARISMA). Luckily, the performances and direction made THE FOUNTAIN palatable. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend the film to anyone and I'm fine never seeing it again but it was an unobjectionable way to spend two hours.",7,8,20,15 September 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Will Ferrell's best performance (except for maybe Starsky & Hutch)
","Definitely cut from that 'out there' cloth of Charley Kauffman (ADAPTATION, BEING JOHN MALCOVICH), STRANGER THAN FICTION is a more accessible film. Harold Crick (an understated Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent living a bland life of quiet desperation that's narrated by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Little does he know that he's the main character in Eiffel's latest novel. Luckily, this isn't one of those 'writer makes fictional character do dumb things' films a la Rob Reiner's ALEX & EMMA but a fun mix of narrative fiction and schizophrenia.When a psychologist (Linda Hunt) can't help him, Harold goes to a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman, also thankfully understated) who tries to determine what genre Harold is living. There's also a romance along the way with a baker that Harold is auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal) that feels a little undercooked. Queen Latifah is also along for the ride in kind of a wasted role and apparently Tom Hulce is somewhere in this film but I just can't remember seeing him in it.I'm not usually one for Will Ferrell films but was glad to see him playing it relatively straight here. There were very few yelling fits or broad physical comedy. It's actual more of a 'serio-comic' performance and, as long as he doesn't go around moping if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination, he could teach Jim Carrey a thing or two about how to easily pass from comedy to dramedy without delving into crap like THE TRUMAN SHOW or MAN IN THE MOON.Whatever you do, don't watch the preview for this one, though, as it gives away quite a few of the film's finer moments.",8,15,49,8 September 2006
