The Blair Witch Project," its a documentary film
","Well, I see there are a lot of people who don't deserve to see this movie. Everyone who hate this movie are in the wrong way, but it's not purely yours. The advertisement has gives the wrong perception about this movie. They said this movie is 'the scariest movie ever made'. It's not true; because I think we have to put another perspective while seeing this movie.I've seen a lot of movie 'Scary movie' like 'Scream', 'Urban legend', etc. I didn't close my eyes, because I can predict what would happen, sometime they even make me laugh. When I watched 'The Blair Witch Project', I didn't close my eyes either, but it because I didn't want to loose any detail of the movie that trully happened. That is the different. Anyway, I shouldn't compare TBW with any other 'scary' movies, as they are different.Some people describe TBW as a documentary movie. That is maybe the closest description; the producer have their footage and put it together. They didn't add some soundtrack maybe because they just want to show it as the way it is. It just likes or something like documentary films such as 'bermuda triangles', 'UFO', etc. But this time the moviemakers are the victims and they were filmed in all their experiences to the last second. After the film finished, I even didn't moved from my seat for couple of minutes, because it remain a mistery about what really happened to them.I recommend this movie to all X-file fans as I do. If You hate X-file, maybe You would hate TBW too.",Null,0,2,19 March 2000
