The Blair Witch Project," huh?
","I'm convinced I saw a different movie than everyone else. I left the theater feeling completely suckered. I think it's complete bulls**t to say that 'it's so good because they don't actually show anything and you have to use your imagination.' I've scared the bejesus out of myself in the dark at night with no prompting and I found nothing scary about this movie. It wasn't scary to me and it wasn't silly to me, I felt nothing. I was bored. Maybe if they had used even half the information on the webpage as background it would have been better. For now, I just feel gypped. ..",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
