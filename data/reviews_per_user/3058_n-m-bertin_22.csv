Blade Runner 2049," You haven't felt like this in front of a film in a long time
","I was a huge fan of the first film, it aired in Europe with the director's cut, I never saw the other cut. It was dark, violent, transporting. The new one is different. It is by all means Villeneuve's baby. The symbiotic between the music (or the absence of it) and the visuals is stunning. It is akin to what you see in Interstellar, and if this is the future of movies, I like it. It is not the same emotions as Interstellar though. Blade Runner 2049 feels incredibly lonely and powerful, even more than the first one. By making it bigger, by showing us how the world is, you actually feel even more lonely and sad.There are scenes where the tension is so vivid you can hardly breathe. There is the violence you don't expect, even just the emotional violence. For some reason I felt the most powerful scene is Luv's last scene, her will to live was just incredibly powerful, especially next to K/Joe's implacable resistance. There is so much to this movie... First of all it doesn't betray the first one. I liked how it was faithful yet went beyond. You still don't know whether or not Deckard is a replicant. And that blackout even, with Wallace not able to make replicant as good as Tyrell's was very well written. It basically means replicants today are even more faulty (which is why they need constant baseline checks, and why K is so faulty and human, most people seem to miss that).Some people will say Deckard isn't there for 2 thirds of the movie. I didn't mind. This is mostly about K. I thought it was even better that he wasn't Deckard's child, it made his character more powerful. I didn't expect it to be so well written, but I can't find a single plot hole... And people who do are mistaken. Why did Stelline implant real memories in replicants ? So they'd find her parents.I think this movie is a rare case of everything working at once : the perfect director, whose style is now so vivid. You feel the gigantism, loneliness, and tension you felt in Arrival in Blade Runner 2049. The casting is amazing, especially the female characters (Gosling being great of course). The visuals are stunning, especially in relationship to the music. The music doesn't work on its own I think it just works with the images. Also it knows when to go away. So many powerful scenes where there is no music yet it's deafening.Not doing well in the box office ? You bet you ass it's not. It's 2h40 of raw emotions, visuals, sound and acting. People believe you can see it without having seen the first Blade Runner. I believe you NEED to see the first one to appreciate it to the fullest. So many Easter eggs it's unbelievable. That makes it even more powerful. It's a movie that, like the previous one, will last for a very long time. No one believed this sequel was a good idea, they did it anyway. Thank you.",10,2,11,9 October 2017
Iron Man 3," Rubbish...
","Iron Man 3 is just a melting pot of a lot of plots in the comic books. It's pretty clear that the main goal was to introduce A.I.M., to use it later in other Marvel movies, but other than that, it's chaos.Yes in the comic there's an arc with a villain capable of regenerating himself, and some human bombs. But not an army of fire breathing demons or something... Yes in the comic there is an arc where Tony Stark uses all his old armors, but they're not in autopilot, he has to pilot them himself, all at once, and that's what was brilliant. Here it's just for show, and it's ridiculous. Yes there is an Iron Patriot in the comic, but it's the Dark Avengers' version of Iron Man, with Norman Osborn in it, AKA the Green Goblin, when he was head of the new version of SHIELD after the Skrull disaster... Obviously they couldn't do this, since they killed him in the Spiderman series... so why bringing the Iron Patriot like that ? It's pointless and pathetic...So, does Tony Stark evolve ? Well not really... Since they refuse to show his alcoholism on screen (but apparently don't have any problem showing terrorist attacks a couple of weeks after Boston lol...), all they could do was introduce some couple problems with Pepper... Well guess what, it doesn't work. I don't know how Guy Pearce got convinced to play in this, but he makes for the worst villain ever. No depth, no motivation, it's very badly written. Making a hero work isn't that hard, the hard part is making a villain work... The joker and Bane were quite good in the Batman series, but in the Iron Man series it's a succession of awfully written characters. Even in all the Marvel movies, there may be only 2 descent villains : Loki and the Green Goblin. That's it. Magneto and the Abomination were kind of fun, but the rest are appalling : Bullseye, Sandman, Whiplash, the Red Skull, Sebastian Shaw, etc...Secondary characters ? Rubbish as well. War Machine/Iron Patriot brings nothing but laughable pity, Jon Favreau's character is totally out of place, Pepper forgives everything and transforms into a superhero at the end (the arc in the comic book was again so much better...), Rebecca Hall's role could simply have been erased it's so useless, and James Badge Dale delivers a pale copy of X-Files' super soldiers...I watched it in IMAX 3D, and frankly, it wasn't worth it. The 3D is just as bad as in The Avengers : the movie is clearly not made for it, it's just a post production effect, not a desire from the director to shoot it in 3D. Same with the IMAX scenes, nothing pops out like the scenes in the Batman movies or the last Mission Impossible. All in all, it's one of the worst Marvel movies ever. Even Thor was better than that.",3,35,69,29 April 2013
Lone Survivor," Well executed but could have been better
","Initially I wanted to rate this movie 8. Because it is very well executed. It's tense, you feel like they are never gonna make it, you don't expect the chopper to be shot down, and neither do you expect the help from the villagers. It is very dramatic and realistic, and while Mark Wahlberg is often too over the top, here he was right for the part. It is violent without being gore, and honestly I didn't mind having very little introduction to the characters. The movie is the mission, period. But all over the movie something didn't feel right. The mountains felt weird, the light felt weird. The trees reminded me of my trip to the American South West. And what do you know, they shot this in New Mexico... At first I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought 'well maybe the mountains in Afghanistan look like this'. They don't... I looked it up and there are pastures, fields, the trees are different, the landscape is different. I'm not saying they should have shot this in Afghanistan, but at least do it somewhere close in terms of vegetation and agriculture. Try Northern India, Kazakhstan, Western China, Turkmenistan... Countries where you can actually shoot. But this habit of just finding the closest thing right here in the US never works for me. In We Were Soldiers I could tell this wasn't shot in South East Asia (they did it in California), and here it does not feel like Afghanistan.",7,2,3,9 July 2017
We Were Soldiers," The shooting location kinda ruined this for me
","'We Were Soldiers' has the reputation of getting the Vietnam war right in the eyes of the veterans. So I was expecting a realistic battle. That I got, and I was pleased to see the Vietcong side as well, which you never see. I also loved Barry Pepper's character, even though he's on film for maybe 20% of the movie. It felt right. But what didn't and ruined the movie for me is the shooting location. They shot this in California; I didn't know that before watching it. But immediately I thought 'I feel in a temperate climate somewhere in Europe or North America, not in South-East Asia'. The trees are wrong, the grasses are wrong, the dried creeks are wrong. They could have shot this in the Philippines, like Apocalypse Now, in Thailand, Malaysia... Even in central America like Panama or something. Why the hell go to California ? For all the things it got right, I really regret that location choice.",6,0,3,9 July 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A bit watered down and predictable
","I love McDonagh movies. They're fresh, funny, sad and touching, and you can never predict what's gonna happen next. In Bruges is a real masterpiece. Here I was expecting the same given the amazing reviews. Unfortunately, it is a bit watered down. The jokes didn't really hit home for me. Many of them are racial jokes aimed at making the audience uncomfortable, like in Get Out, but still... And during the whole movie I felt like it was held back. Acts don't have consequences, no one dies that shouldn't die. And my initial prediction of the movies proved correct : they never catch the murderer, and once you hear about Idaho and their plan to go there, you know the movie will end right here, that there won't be a last act outside Ebbing. The performances of the actors save the movie, and a few scenes are funny. But some characters don't hit home : the son, the 19 year old bimbo, or the replacement police chief. I didn't connect with them, and I didn't have as much empathy for the mother as I had for characters in In Bruges (all of them).",7,0,3,23 January 2018
Pacific Rim," Awful writing, great action scenes
","OK let's cut right to the chase: the dialogue and the actors are awful. And I mean really awful, even for an action movie. The last Die Hard looks like Citizen Kane in comparison. And that's why no one in their right mind can decently put 10/10 on that movie. But other than that, it kicks a few butts. First, unlike most hero movies out there, it's not limited to the US. That was especially visible in a movie which came out only a few weeks ago, Man of Steel. Here it's only about America, and as usual, Manhattan takes the hit... In Pacific Rim, you have scenes in San Francisco, Sydney, Anchorage, Hong-Kong... A team of Russians, of Japanese, you have Chinese employees, a German name for the robot etc... France is forgotten, God knows why (maybe nobody told them that Tahiti is in the Pacific...), as well as New-Zealand. Now this is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously. The 'love story' everyone's fearing is actually hardly developed. So now for the action. First of all, I've seen it in Imax 3D. This is about the best 3D I've seen in a movie. Far superior to The Avengers (which wasn't made for 3D anyway), Man of Steel, Clash of the Titans or Prometheus to name a few recent movies. It's probably neck and neck with Avatar. Except that there are no 'contemplation' scenes, it's about 2 hours of non-stop fighting. So it can be pretty brutal for some viewers. The fights are quite inventive, and not 'polished'. This is dirty fighting, in storms, at night, in the rain etc... It's not poetic with sunny skies, unlike Evangelion which is clearly one of the influences of the movie though. Hong-Kong is nicely rendered, and the synchronized fighting (again taken from Evangelion, although modified) isn't that ridiculous (the costumes are though). I simply wished they hadn't done what everybody does : when civilians die, they don't show it. When soldiers die, it's fine, you can put it on screen. I'm tired of this... So all in all, apart from the dialogues where you really have to shut your eyes in disbelief sometimes, it's a good action movie. Certainly better than Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel, because it's unpretentious.",7,0,5,18 July 2013
Baby Driver," Tries too hard to be cool
","During the first quarter, the movie is quite fun and entertaining. But you still feel the main character does a bit too much, it's clearly trying to be a Tarantino movie from the 90's. A cool score, short blasts of action, likable baddies. The rest is basically taken from Drive. It also suffers from the 'where is the supposedly second star of the film ?' Jon Bernthal is credited second, but you see him only for a few minutes... What happened there ? Jamie Foxx's character is also pretty weak, and Spacey's... just feels weird.It is fun yes, but as far as car chases go I've seen better, and you never really care for Baby. His backstory is too easy, too short, the love story too cliché. The 90s used to be riddled with Tarantino ripoffs like this one, especially after Pulp Fiction. There hasn't been one in a long time, so I guess that's why people think it's great again... But this movie will be forgotten pretty soon. I can rewatch Drive or Pulp Fiction any day, but this ? No thanks.",4,3,6,20 September 2017
The Revenant," Visually amazing but more of a horror film than a historical depiction
","The movie is stunning there's no denying that. All this shooting directly in the wild paid off, it was worth the effort. Also, there are a couple of memorable scenes, like the bear attack, sleeping inside a horse's carcass... DiCaprio and Hardy are great actors, Hardy is like a chameleon... But he needs to stop with the weird accents, it goes too far.What I didn't like about the movie is how bleak it is. You're made to believe at first that it's a period movie, historically accurate. And I know some people will still believe it going out from this... But it's wildly fictional. First, Indian attacks wouldn't decimate a well armed expedition like this. We're made to believe that back in the day EVERYONE was a savage. Indians killed for fun, the French raped and lied, and the Americans took Indians into slavery or something, and were basically constantly at war. All of this is false. First, the French were known to be mostly peaceful traders, never really at war with the Indians, forming alliances against the English. Second, in the real story, no one died. Glass just went back to Fitz, asked him his gun back, and Fitz didn't kill anyone (Glass never had a son). It's all fiction, and all false. You don't go in icy water so often without stopping first to dry off your clothes by a fire. You don't fall from a cliff into a tree without any injury. You don't recover from a broken leg in a few weeks, or from infection with dry grass and smoke. Texas didn't have any 'ranger' at the time. The Indians weren't wiped and devoid of every property (yet). I know it's just a movie blablabla but I fear that many people will take this as historical accuracy, thinking white men were constantly at war with Indians, raping and murdering them at any chance in return. This was not the case at all...",7,0,0,7 November 2017
Ender's Game," A lot of good potential wasted
","Ender's Game is one of those movies that have been utterly destroyed during editing. If you've read the book you know what I'm talking about. In the book, Peter is much more developed and both Ender's siblings are as smart as him, just less or more empathic than him. In the movie, it's skipped to gain time. Peter is shown as a brainless bully, which is totally wrong.In the same way, the Battle School isn't developed enough. One game and that's it ? He moves to real battles ? In the book he stays in school until he finishes first of all the teams, with a great development of skill, both from him and his lieutenants... In the movie you see none of that, and of course you wonder how those newbies make it as Ender's seconds in command, it just doesn't seem right...The last one is the Mind Game obviously. Same thing, in the book it's way more developed. Ender had to struggle before deciding to kill the giant, he had to struggle to find the best way to deal with the serpent. In the same struggle of Ender's feelings, the first boy he kicks is actually dead in the book, they don't even mention it here, it added much more drama to the mix.That's a shame because otherwise the casting is good, directing is good, special effects are good... I don't know if it's the producers' fault, who wanted a movie under 2 hours for maximum profit (it happens so often...) or if the director's vision was wrong, but all those problems were so easy to fix... Ender's Game isn't supposed to be an action movie. It's supposed to be a Sci-Fi drama, about the psychological state of mind of a growing boy. Instead they made it too much into an action movie, and that's the wrong direction. Same thing happened with Blade Runner by the way, the producers were afraid that the audience wouldn't understand everything, wanting a happy end etc... Well in the same way, maybe we'll have a good Director's Cut for Ender's Game, and it'll gain popularity as the years go by...Oh and the last piece : why the hell did they remove the near-speed of light space travel ? Who can believe that a near destroyed Earth can have an orbital space training station for kids and a giant invasion fleet with the little Doctor only 50 years after fighting with obsolete fighter jets ? In the book it's hundreds of years apart, there are no fighter jets, and Mazer Rackham was kept in fast space travel so he wouldn't age and be ready to train his successor. Without that they basically shot themselves in the foot for all the potential sequels to the movie, as relative time and relative aging is a huge component of the story. It's weird, it's like some aspect are well preserved or adapted from paper to film by a competent team, and amongst all this somebody is trying really hard to jeopardize everything...",6,2,5,2 February 2014
Now You See Me," Very pretentious
","At no point in the movie was there a single sequence where you don't want to punch any of the main protagonists in the face. Everything is so rubbish Hollywood that you wanna puke. The French girl with her ridiculous accent, the ridiculously stupid FBI agents who couldn't find their own kids in their own home, the pretentious magicians... Even Morgan Freeman finds real trouble playing his part, which is very badly written.There's no real plot by the way, it's just a succession of tricks and flashbacks and action scenes with no real connection. There's no drama, no intensity, and no point. This is a 'story' that would require elegant and skillful writing : since it's clearly not there, the film fails completely. Oh and the music is horrid.If you want a good magic movie, just watch The Prestige. Even though the story is less believable, it's well written, well played, and it's got drama and intensity. You care for the characters. Something 'Now You See Me' clearly didn't understand.",2,8,14,10 September 2013
Django Unchained," Rubbish
","After 20 years, Tarantino is still editing his movies like Pulp Fiction... While it worked for the 90's masterpiece, it's just plain ridiculous nowadays. Many people call this movie messy, and it is. First of all, if you want to do such a movie, almost 3 hours is way too long...Tarantino is only doing homage movies, just more and more badly each time... This one is supposed to be a Sergio Leone homage, but it's more like a parody : Scary Movie in the far-west or something. There's not an inch of depth in this film. There's not an ounce of script. A black slave liberated by a bounty hunter, and then they want to save the black man's wife. That's it. The rest is just gunfire, explosions, and boring dialogs. Sergio Leone's movies had depth : depth of character, depth of landscape, a well written script, and you weren't bored.Django is hip, and that's why it gets such a (ridiculous) high score on IMDb. Blood everywhere, snappy lines, hip hop music, bad guys killed, good guys winning... At no point in the movie does this feel like a story (real or not). You can clearly see the actors don't believe in it, and are just having fun. Di Caprio is probably the worst, totally out of place as a Southern plantation owner. The violence is extremely gratuitous, and the 'harsh' scenes where good guy get tortured/killed have absolutely no dramatic effect whatsoever. Again, it just feels wrong, out of place, and even offensive, turning the history of slavery into a joke.Tarantino should just stop making movies for fun, and should start by letting other people write his scripts... Maybe then we'll have a story.",2,1,8,9 April 2013
The Theory of Everything," Not as good as I'd hoped: too far from reality
","First and foremost, it is a movie about Hawking's wife, not himself. After all it's based on her autobiographical book, not his. So there is very little science, all things considered, which was kinda disappointing. You know very little about his colleagues, about his own discoveries. The actors are great, and some scenes are memorable though. But all in all it was disappointing in one particular aspect: accuracy.It shows Hawking as very understanding, and as his wife sacrificing everything once she knows he has the disease. Except she KNEW he was sick BEFORE dating him in real life, while the movie shows the opposite... Moreover, you don't feel the years she had to suffer taking care of himself and the kids alone while he refused exterior help. In the movie you feel like the first time he sees her suffering he says 'ok we need help'. That is not what happened. This is the issue when you wanna show a period of 40 years in one movie, you can't show all the suffering and disputes, as it would be too much to take in for the audience. I've heard that Hawking had a great sense of humor which is shown here, but I've also heard that he can be a jerk, and you don't see that here at all. It's too mellow, despite the disease, and the complex platonic relationship with Jonathan. It's also too Americanised: a lot of orchestral music to trigger emotions at specific moments, I hate that.It was the exact same issues with Les Intouchables: the music is too present, and they don't show the reality. In the real story of Les Intouchables, Omar Sy's character was closer to a real criminal, was violent. Once there is a discussion where you hear 'maybe we should tone it down for the public' it's over, you can't make a great movie out of it.",6,0,1,23 October 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Too tough to follow Civil War...
","This X-Men movie doesn't bring anything more to the plate. It still feels like Marvel's baby brother. Not as strong actors, a weak script, bad characters' origins... It's a good action/superhero movie with a couple of great scenes, but it's just too ridiculous in some parts.Now let's get into details. First of all, the bad characters. Psylocke is pathetic. There's 0 origin, she doesn't have her psychic powers as opposed to the comic, she has like 4 lines, and so is just as useless as Bishop was in the previous X-Men movie. Angel is utterly ruined. In the Age of Apocalypse comic books and some follow ups, he's a HUGE part, he's supposed to be Death... But here he's just a jerk kid with no past, no motivation, who gets killed easily. Rubbish. And by the way, Apocalypse is supposed to NAME his horsemen (Death, War, Famine, Pestilence). Nothing here. Storm is kind of OK, but you feel like he picked some weak mutants for the job, apart from Magneto.Magneto by the way has some OK scenes, but the arrow thing ? Come on... Who wrote this ? It's ridiculous. One arrow, two kills ? In real life you can't pierce two bodies with a small wooden arrow and a small wooden bow... Plus there's no Wanda Maximov in the Fox's universe so it's a bit ridiculous to have Quicksilver (which is great again) without her.Apocalypse and Xavier are OK, Apo is a good villain, but again, the script is just poor. You had 3 acts in Civil War. In there, it feels like only one act. Remember the teaser with Mystique supposedly training the X-Men ? No it's not a second act as I was waiting for it to happen, it's just the epilogue... So it feels short, mainly because you have to introduce all those characters and put in some cameos (Wolverine's cameo is quite bad frankly). When they start fighting, there's like 20 min left in the movie... The whole Weapon X thing should have been removed. This is an Apocalypse movie...To me, Beast and Mystique were disappointments again. I still believe the Mystique from the original movies was better. Here she just feels too weak. As for Beast, it's mostly the costume and makeup. It's just ridiculous. He's too thin, and bright sky blue...Amongst the new characters, Cyclops is OK but nothing great there. His origins are too long, he still isn't a leader, and his brother's death feels out of place. Nightcrawler is basically just a tool to teleport the team and they didn't have time for his origin story... In the end, the best scene of the movie is obviously the Phoenix scene, that'll give you chills. They've done it well, but we kinda expect it.All in all, it's never gonna become a classic. The script is too weak, they don't have enough background to built on. Coming out AFTER Civil War makes it feel so small in comparison... I mean we wanted the AGE of Apocalypse. Not just Apocalypse barely doing some damage in Cairo... The horsemen are terrible, but you get 30 seconds of Phoenix... It could (and SHOULD) have been a lot better. X-Men movie fans will probably love it for that phoenix scene, or for the 'grandeur' it sometimes displays, and Fox gave them nice little carrots here and there (Wolverine, a bald Xavier, Magneto and his concentration camp past...) but it's just not enough for me, I need a good script. The whole film takes place in what, a couple of days ? Again Civil War had time to develop, with the incident in Lagos, then the accords, then the escape, the fight, the villain etc... etc... Here, it's the origin of everyone, for like an hour, then Apo collecting his horsemen and convincing them at the speed of light (what a sweet talker...), then a 15 min fight. The end.",7,6,14,19 May 2016
Ex Machina," Not enough depth
","The directing is good, the acting is good. But at the end of the movie, you feel disappointed. It could have gone further. You feel like the writer wasn't smart enough for that. Like there's no way an AI test would be designed that way, no way that a single person could design both the structure and the intelligence itself, it would be a team of people.The writer had a fantasy about this remote setting, but in the end Nathan feels too much like a drunk bully as opposed to the genius he's supposed to be. The ending feels predictable, I mean there's a middle ground between the 'the robot was manipulating everyone' and the potential happy ending. And the thing is, both of those extremes are simplistic. Making a sad ending doesn't make a better movie, it's been done and redone now, it's time to do something more complex. Great sci-fi movies aren't black and white in the end. Just have a look at Blade Runner, Interstellar, or Dark City. This is not a groundbreaking movie, it just feels good because it's filling an incredible void in sci fi movies. Right now everybody's doing super heroes and comic book characters. For true sci-fi, there's Nolan and the others. So when someone does something a bit different (or at least it feels different in 2015), then yeah people are gonna praise it. But in reality, I'm afraid this movie will be forgotten quite quickly.The directing and acting feels a bit like Gattaca, but it's far from its impact, very far.",6,0,1,28 November 2015
Lincoln," Shallow
","It's the type of movie that people think should be done, the type of movie you know the man playing Lincoln will get the Oscar if he's any talented... Again, it's Spielberg up to the task, and it's getting old... It's full of good feelings, of great actors, of drooling music... Frankly, we're tired of this.Anybody who rates this movie so high has never seen the HBO TV series on John Adams, because THAT was good. That was unpretentious, and despite the overall historical accuracy, you could understand it. Here, 'Lincoln' is full of boring political dialogs and useless secondary plots (the one with his son Robert is so badly executed...), and you can clearly see Spielberg didn't know how to end it. So he just did a speedy shot of his youngest son hearing the news in a theater, just to confuse the audience. What's the point ? If you refuse to show the assassination, or to talk about it, then just don't show it at all... There's nothing wrong in ending the movie in Lincoln still alive, we all know what happens next...And the music, God the music... It's everywhere, ever seen a European or South-East Asian dramatic movie ? You don't need to use this Hollywood music so much to tell the audience what to feel... Spielberg is one of the best directors of the 20th century. In the 21st, he's just a parody of himself. He doesn't evolve, hence we all pity him. He's making the same movies, they just don't talk to us anymore, don't mean anything. The new world of movies is dark, honest, brutal, experimental, and doesn't treat the audience like we're all sobbing uneducated housewives...",4,1,4,4 May 2013
Taken," Classic Besson : nothing much to see...
","I can't believe this thing gets such good reviews. It's a B movie with money and good fight scenes, that's it. The filming is appalling, camera shaking everywhere (a copycat from the Bourne trilogy). The action scenes are so cliché : a car chase, some guys jumping from bridges, the hero getting tied up and escaping at the last minute, some corrupt law enforcers, and a pathetic final boss with his special weapon...Nothing new, but it gets well reviewed because of some gross and dramatic background with the Alabanian mafia and human trafficking. It also plunges into the 'Dexter syndrome', meaning as long as it's bad guys, it's OK to torture them. Yeah I can understand that it can be a pop corn movie some might enjoy, but that's it. There's no script, dialogs are terrible (poor Famke Jansen...), the subject of human trafficking (which is very much real) is pathetically used as justification, and the real bad guys are mostly Eastern European and Arabs while the bad French are just 'doing business' and 'providing for their families'...Besson just had a little fantasy about a vengeful CIA agent killing everyone and that's it. Hard to believe he did Léon when you see this thing he wrote.",4,2,5,3 February 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Not accurate at all
","I'm getting tired of films advertising themselves as based on the truth, first hand accounts etc... when they're not. I don't mind having a strong female lead that did more than in reality, but I do mind when the audience is given the impression she was the only one working her ass off and being smart about this bin Laden hunt...I also do mind when we're being shown that torture works, while it's been proved that it mostly produces lies from prisoners to escape said tortures. Lies that need to be investigated, and that waste resources. I also do mind when, again, Navy SEALs are shown as gung-ho morons. And of course I do mind stupid stuff such as making Pakistanis speak the wrong language, showing a movie that spans 10 years without the actors aging a single day (ever heard of MAKE UP ARTISTS ?), or depicting the CIA as stupid idiots, particularly the bosses.And finally I think the lead role is weak. I don't know what happened to Jessica Chastain but I could throw a rock at a train station and hit a more convincing person to play a CIA agent... It has a lot to do with the writers too. Could you set up a character LESS ? We have no idea who she is. Still don't at the end of the movie. In fact it's true of ALL characters in the movie. The audience don't care about those characters. Maybe it was on purpose because we're supposed to focus on the hunt and the true facts ? Except that it's all distorted, those aren't the true facts, because it's classified...Anyway it's a half-assed movie for a subject that deserved a LOT more.",5,1,3,8 July 2017
Wonder Woman," A good fun movie but not the masterpiece many call it
","I've seen the movie twice now, at several months interval. At first I really liked it because finally we saw a proper, well done DC movie. I thought many of the situations were funny, I liked that they were ballsy enough to make Wonder Woman actually kill people. The special effects are great, and the main actors are good. I liked the WW1 setting and the photography, as well as the rampage scene at the end where she goes crazy.On the second viewing I was more reserved though. I think the first act is too long, it leaves few scenes at the battlefront, there's 2 really : the trenches and the village, plus the airfield. I think the main issue I had were the dialogues though. Some were really really cheesy, like love will save us all, or when Trevor asks Diana to help him after she killed the German general and nothing happened. There's like a full 60 sec of hesitation and poor writing... It was really hard to watch. The Amazon battle was a bit too much too, all these showy gymnastics, and the death of her aunt that wlacked drama. The Ares twist is also a bit too difficult to swallow, as well as how easy she kills him in the end (problem for Justice League : if she can kill the God of War that easily, who can fight her...). Those are not too serious problems, it's still a good movie, but I doubt it will stand the test of time. We tend to be magnanimous because it's the first female hero movie, and because there has been so many bad DC movies lately, but in the end it's a good film, not a masterpiece.",7,0,4,6 November 2017
Black Panther," I didn't care for the characters.
","Black Panther is a beautiful movie, but I was never IN it. I never felt like Wakanda was real. Who believes such an advanced nation would still not be a democracy ? Or that it was never discovered (even before they had the cloaking technology) ? I think my main concern though is T'Challa. I don't understand him, he's never developed enough. They think his introduction in Civil War is enough... And people seem to praise the villain. Well he has some legitimous concerns for sure, he's basically the audience asking itself 'if Wakanda is so advanced why is it not helping other black people around the world ?'. But he's too much of a show-off with his big muscles and everything. The character of Ross is also very poor. 0 development, he's weak, at no point his position in the CIA is actually earned. As a movie I understand that it's a milestone for some, just like Luke Cage was. But it is not a reason to overlook the issues plaguing this film. I think it would have been a much better movie if Black Panther was a scientific genius like in the comic, he even evented a science, 'shadow physics'. Here, they split his personality : the genius isn't him, it's his sister. If he were the scientific genius, his place on the Wakanda throne would be much more justified. As is, he's there just because he's the prince. There is a lot of unjustified stuff in the movie. Why is W'Kabi betraying T'Challa ? Why does M'Baku suddenly help ? Anyway, it was quite boring (because it's long as well) and Wakanda is beautiful but not that impressive, we just see one city. And I'm annoyed that Marvel movies always take place over the course of a couple of days. There's never any room for training, improvement, it's just action/reaction...",5,1,1,4 May 2018
Deadpool," Very faithful to the comic, very funny, very well made
","I think we all knew Deadpool was gonna be good. I didn't know what they were gonna change, and I think I'm still a bit disappointed when they modify things unnecessarily (like Weasel turning into a bartender or Deadpool being a mutant). But overall the humor is definitely there, the directing is great for such a low budget, and the story is overall quite good (only lacking a better villain maybe, but since Deadpool isn't really a hero, he doesn't need that strong a villain).For comic-book fans, they may regret that there is no Dr. Killebrew, no mention of Weapon X, that in the end Deadpool get Vanessa (and that she's not a mutant) etc... But as for being faithful to the comics, they will see Blind Al, a funny relationship with the cab driver (classic Deadpool), Wade making fun of the X-Men, breaking the 4th wall etc... Although the numerous trailers spoiled a number of jokes, there's still a good barrelful of them left so you can laugh the whole movie. Deadpool's origins are also well shown.Given the low budget for that type of movie, the action scenes are quite amazing too. It is fast paced so maybe that's why you can't tell, but it doesn't have to blush compared to the X-Men movies. The Easter eggs (like the Green Lantern photo) are great too, and if you were wondering why Negasonic is there like me, well it's purely for comical effect (so is Colossus and his funny Russian accent).There's obviously gonna be a sequel, and in the credits it's mentioned it's gonna be with Cable. I don't think they can do the big story arc there is in the Deadpool & Cable comics (they're gonna need the Avengers' movie budget...) but I'm curious to see what it's gonna turn like. Keep'em coming.",9,4,14,19 February 2016
Annihilation," Nice little Sci Fi movie
","I was pleasantly surprised with Annihilation. It has some very good ideas, although scientifically quite impossible. It is its own little world, with great characters. It always feels tense, desperate and sad, with a touch of poetry. It is derivative, it takes from Alien, from Jurassic Park, and especially from Arrival. Portman's character is quite close from Amy Adams' character in Arrival. A lonely woman, driven by her work, looking for redemption. I didn't mind the ending, I think it added to the originality of the movie. The special effects of the doubles were not very good though, but the crystal towers and the animals were very well done. I really prefered it to Ex Machina which premise was bad : no one can believe a single scientist can create the perfect android with the perfect AI. No one has all these skills. But here there aren't really any plotholes. Like Blade Runner 2049, some stuff is open to interpretation, which is fine. The director/writer however adapted the book without knowing it was gonna be a trilogy. So he had to guess what the author had in mind, and make up the rest so he had a complete movie. That's why it doesn't feel that coherent all the time, like the intentions of the meteorite for example, or the scientific nature of the shimmer (DNA prism ?) and why I only give it a 7.",7,1,4,23 April 2018
Spectre," Appalling script
","You can get all the amazing actors you want (and there are a ton in this movie...), when the script is utter garbage, it simply doesn't work. Are we supposed to believe that Bond can destroy a helicopter with one bullet from 200 m away ? That a villain will leave a net and a boat for Bond and his girl to escape when he's trying to kill them ? That said girl falls in love with him after one night ? That we still believe in the 'mouse showing the secret room' trick ? That a top notch secret facility in the middle of nowhere can be destroyed with, again, one bullet making everything explode ? There's no tension, no drama, no thrill, it's just long, boring, badly made. It's a self parody, like the last Terminator. How Sam Mendes agreed to direct this after reading the script I have no idea. This is one of the worst Bond films ever.",3,8,15,7 April 2016
