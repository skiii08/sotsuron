Blade Runner 2049," Very Good!
","Although it could be somewhat slow at times this movie had an incredible amount of detail. It captured the essence of the original very well and overall it was extremely well made. Very impressive !! 
If you are a movie buff you must watch this.",10,1,4,24 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Real Fans will hate this
","If you're just looking for a good time, The Last Jedi is an excellent movie. Its extremely entertaining and well made as a film. As a huge star wars fan though(who bought tickets months before its release) its the worst in the franchise. The story just ruins every character, everything that happened was just a complete disappointment / anti-climactic. It is very poorly written in relation to the saga of 8 films it just followed. There is now nothing for JJ to work with for Episode 9.",1,23,40,15 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Worst star wars film yet
","As a star wars film, its horrible and riddled with plot holes. Obviously the staff aren't fans and don't know anything about the characters. 
It was as if a horrible script was handed to a good director. It was visually pleasing and the crew was great but the story was appalling. 
As a huge fan I don't even consider this canon. Every person I talked to was equally displeased. C- , I am so upset.",1,7,10,24 December 2017
