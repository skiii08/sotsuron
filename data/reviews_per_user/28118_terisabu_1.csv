Iron Man 3," What a way to end the Iron Man franchise!
","SPOILER ALERT!!!Iron Man 3 is the worst Iron Man movie I have ever seen.The house being destroyed scene is too much.The way Tony and Pepper were blown up and survived is ridiculous. And Pepper's boobs couldn't fit into Tony's suit,it would squish them.When my parents and I saw Tony's suits 8-42 in the final battle scene,they didn't look like his suits at all. They looked like the robots from Transformers or Real Steel.I thought Tony using his suits as fireworks to make Pepper happy was the worst scene ever. The last thing to say about his suits is Tony shouldn't let the helicopters blow up his suits,he should have saved his mark 1-7 because they looked so much better then his mark 8-42.The suits 8-42 shouldn't fly by themselves, they're suits not airplanes. And Rhodes'suit looked like Captain America.They should do better than that. Every time they talked to Tony about 'The Avengers' he had an anxiety attack,the wimpiest thing I ever saw. Its like me talking about saving a bird from being alone, I get an anxiety attack,you might think I'm a wimp.Iron Man 3 copied a couple of scenes from 'The Dark Knight Rises'.They copied the destroyed mask and they copied the hospital scene which is very ridiculous.They should have their own ideas.Rebecca Hall is terrible in this movie. I couldn't understand a word she said, she doesn't move her mouth. They should have chosen someone else besides that terrible actress.People were given drugs by the bad guy, Killian. Then they were able to blown fire out of their mouth and they could be shot and not die, it's very fake. Killian also had mind control over them? Aldrich Killian is really the Mandarin but has an actor guy that looks like the Mandarin from the comic books with ten rings pretending to be Mandarin.That doesn't follow the comic books.The relationship between Tony & Pepper is not about love, it is about Tony wanting her so he can function. Tony gave Pepper a giant stuffed animal that's like 6 or 7 feet tall, that part is too goofy. If he loved her, his gift would have shown it.The story is so confusing and so lame that you can't tell who's who and what suits are destroyed. And 7.6 its too high for this movie that you can't understand what is going. Tony Stark is so good in The Avengers and he became wimpy in Iron Man 3? When he is with Pepper he's a jerk. In King Kong,Carl Denham said 'the beauty killed the beast',and for Iron Man 3 I say 'Pepper killed Iron Man'.I am very,very glad that they are not making another Iron Man movie because this is so bad. And there's nothing else for me to say,except that Shane Black should not have directed this movie the same as Brett Ratner should not have directed X-Men 3.",1,4,10,18 June 2013
