Iron Man 3," Much Better
","Just gonna do this one quickly. Doubt it'll make a difference cause everyone will watch it anyway.It's the best Iron Man so far, I will say that. However, the first 2 films weren't all that great in my eyes anyway. Director Shane Black takes the franchise in a slightly different direction. Focusing on the Tony Stark character instead of all the gadgetry (there is still a fair amount here, not to worry). It's slightly darker than the previous 2 films and actually has a proper plot this time round.Robert Downey JR does his part again, it's almost as if he was made for this role. The character that I loved most was the Mandarin though. Ben Kingsley steals every scene that he appears in as the terrorist threat to Iron Man. The others sort of trundle along, letting the special effects do the talking.There were too many unexplainable events in the film to rate it seriously, and it's expected being a popcorn Hollywood flick but it's fun, it's one of the blockbusters out now. You'll watch it anyway.",7,0,7,1 May 2013
Oldboy," Dark, disturbing, brilliant.
","Oldboy is a Korean film based on the Japanese Manga of the same name. It is definitely one of the more known Korean films that has been released in recent history which I believe established Park Chan-woo's name to the rest of the world. As it's a really tightly wound plot with twist and turns galore, I'll just say that it centres around vengeance and revenge in a dark manner.First off, Choi Min-sik delivers one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. The desperation, hope and then hopelessness, joy, despair and weakness are all played out with such commitment that you feel it with him. Yu Ji-Tae, the antagonist, plays a rather more understated role but I felt he had such presence that I looked forward to his appearances. The 2 leads carry most of the film and it really just centres around them both.The cinematography is definitely different to what I've seen and it was refreshing. The Manga influence shows through with most shots towards the end, and I'm sure they were close to how it was portrayed in the manga. Then there is that famous one-shot fight scene that's pretty impressive when you think about it. It has caught a bit of flak for the excessive violence and sex scenes but I felt they just added more to the plot and keeping the viewer immersed. Definitely a must-watch.",9,1,6,13 March 2013
Life of Pi," Proper adventure story with the visual effects to match.
","Life of Pi is a story about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck with a Bengal tiger. If that doesn't perk your interest, I'm not too sure what will. This film is a proper adventure story with storytelling that takes you on a journey in a way that I've not experienced in awhile. And boy how it has been translated to visual form is breathtaking. No surprises at all at the cinematography, directing and visual Oscars it's won with the best animation I have ever seen. I can honestly say that in almost no scene was any animation apparent and that just immersed me more into the adventure.Suraj Sharma does a brilliant job as the shipwrecked Pi, and Irrfan Khan plays an understated but equally charming adult Pi. The tiger, Richard Parker, forms a bond with the viewer that creeps up on you, and by the end I was hoping for it's survival as much as for Pi's. For something that spends the majority of the film as an animation, I thought that was fantastic. Perhaps the only con is the religion angle that some may not appreciate. However, I found it was just a facet of the plot and I had no problems with it.I'm going to put myself on the chopping block and say this is one of the most complete films I've seen in a long time. Charming plot, perfectly cast, with a big enough budget to bring it to life visually. I will also say, that I believe this deserved the best picture Oscar. A must watch.",9,7,13,28 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A welcome return to Middle Earth
","I am a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings. All 3 films are easily in my favourites list. When I heard Peter Jackson was to head the Hobbit, this was exciting news. Then they announced it would be split into 3 parts and I was unsure about that. After watching the first part of this trilogy, my fears were somewhat realised. The Hobbit is by no means a long book, so to split it into 3 films would be like butter spread over too much toast. Jackson remedies this somewhat by bringing in characters and plot lines not in the book and the film still runs to about 2 and a half hours. I understand it was deliberately paced in this way but I felt it was a bit slow in parts and I think it would've been perfect if it was 2 films instead of 3.However, the film is brilliantly cast. Martin Freeman plays a superb Bilbo, the 'normal' person in the crazy bunch of characters. He plays the part of the viewer, doubting and showing fear where the rest charge fearlessly. Cameos from some of the LOTR cast are also welcome, as are the locations and sets. All said and done, I still really enjoyed this. As much as people will complain that the franchise is being milked, in all honesty I'm happy for any opportunity to revisit Jackson's middle-earth and if he wants to spread it over 3 films, then so be it. If you're a fan of the LOTR universe you'll watch this anyway, and in no way do I regret doing so. I'll re-watch it in the near future and hope it'll grow on me more then.",8,3,7,11 March 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Good, not great.
","Zero Dark Thirty is a film about the decade long man-hunt for the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. It follows Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, as a CIA agent trying to find Osama. It makes interesting use of Maya as a 'fly on the wall' type character for a glimpse into what the CIA was up to during those 10 years. The CIA has come out to say it's obviously a dramatization of actual proceedings (they definitely would, after those torture scenes), but I think it's loosely based on 2 books about the hunt.Jessica Chastain is brilliant. She plays a CIA agent recruited straight out of High School and basically spends all her time on the Osama chase. She's incredibly tough yet still manages to portray some sort of vulnerability. The supporting cast are solid as well. The film has a very similar feel to 'the Hurt Locker', also directed by Kathryn Bigelow, which examines the mind states of personnel on the frontlines. I think my problem with the film is I expected too much of it. The middle chapter is definitely a slow burner and felt like a chronicle of events more than anything else. The final chapter though, where they re-enact the killing of Osama was pretty good and is the only real 'action' you will see in the movie. If you're expecting gunfights and action, this will not be for you. A majority of the film is spent showing how they linked and tracked down Osama and the difficulties it brought. Overall, it's still a very solid film and definitely worth a watch.",7,0,2,11 March 2013
Trainspotting," Essential viewing of the 90s
","Finally got round to watching this. Although the subject matter is much like Requiem for a Dream, it doesn't feel as dark and I enjoyed a look into the Scottish culture that the troubled youths faced. Shows just how hard it is to go off something, in this case Heroin, when you're mixed up with the wrong crew.Ewan McGregor really really surprised me as the lead. For some reason I never thought he had that in him having only watched some of his more modern films. Loved the feel of the film that had that 'This Is England' setting to it and Danny Boyle does such a good job on a small budget, which again surprised me, having watched Slumdog and 127 hours. Would put this up there with essential viewing of the 90s. All the characters were really memorable and even though the plot seems crazy, I think it's just an exaggeration of a very real problem of which I believe any of us could take something away from.",8,0,1,27 February 2013
