Alien 3," Maybe i need more of a life
","In fact, i KNOW i need more of a life, but i seriously enjoyed this installment of the bug-bashing saga.To be honest, it is near impossible for ANYTHING to surpass the gung-ho action of Aliens, or the groundbreaking creepiness of Alien, but i cannot see anything truly bad about this movie, or anything that warrants it being labelled as 'bad'.Biased Aliens fan that i am, i can honestly rate this as good. Not many films get to Number 3 and still remain as enjoyable as this. I cant help feeling a lot of critics bashed this solely on the basis of it being 'yet another sequel' Very worthy IMO.",Null,6,10,26 February 2002
Titanic," Well...
","Its hard to be too objective about this 'classic', and people far better than me have given far superior reviews/details of this movie here, so i will simply sum up my opinion by saying 'Crap!'.What a waste of space and money this junk is, and as for winning so many Oscars...",Null,2,3,26 February 2002
