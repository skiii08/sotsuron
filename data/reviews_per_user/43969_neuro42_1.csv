Iron Man 3," Robert Downey Jr Provides an even more wooden performance than before
","I will preface this statement with the fact that I like non-snobby movies. This wasn't a snobby movie, but that should drive home the poor rating even harder. This was a poor example of a Marvel movie. Is it representative of what we can expect however? More Amazing Spider-Man? Yes probably.Overall the Acting was very poor, RDJ turned in the same wooden performance he did in the last 4 films, except this time the role did not call for a wooden actor. The film felt overall like a B-Movie with an A++ CGI effect budget. IT is not his fault he is what he is. The role provided for him required a more robust acting experience however.the Movie has no center. It lacks a positive message. It lacks a triumph of good over evil. Instead we get a facade of corporate America posing as 911 conspirators to delude the public into fighting a war on terror that does not exist. Sigh. It almost makes me wish I lived in communist China. At least Chinese citizens are smart enough to understand that what they read on the Internet is probably someone with an Agenda posting it. This story line was written by a child that lives on he Internet and believes that wiki pages are a valid source of information.Let me paraphrase a line from the movie.'Hollywood seems like an American culture representation. Except it is not. It was made by anti-American cooks. Cooks that think America is Evil, 911 conspiracies are real and straight people have no idea how to dress themselves. Just like those beliefs, it is hollow inside. Hollow and filled with poorly scripted platitudes to mollify the ignorant savage.'Or something like that :)",4,1,3,10 June 2013
