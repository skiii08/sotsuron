National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Interesting...I liked It, but something feels missing...
","First of all, National Treasure, the first one, is one of my favorite movie ever. I love history, specifically American history, and it had clever references and facts about American history that lead to finding the treasure in a way that is not predictable. That being said, I felt something was missing in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. It almost felt like the writers could not think of any new, clever clues for Nicolas Cage to solve or more suspense without action scenes.First lets look at the positives. This movie was very well-done. The acting was as superb as the first (Nicolas Cage and Justin Bartha are amazing). It was very believable. Also the action scenes are excellent and full of invigorating suspense. The scene near the unexpected end where they had to balanced the steel block thing in the cave was terrific. All the action scenes were awesome: right out of an Indiana Jones movie. Another thing I liked was the ironic humor and sarcasm used by Nicolas Cage's character and other characters throughout the movie that gave it a light, fun feel. With interesting history references and a brilliant score by Trevor Rabin, what could be wrong with it?You may not agree with me. But I felt that the ending, and a few other scenes were rushed. For example, they spent literally about five minutes in Paris both finding and figuring out the clue. After that they moved on to London, they spent about 15 minutes there, 5 of them were spent finding the clue. It all felt rushed which tended to confuse me. And the ending definitely did not satisfy me. It was too sudden and I felt it was incomplete, even though the movie was over two hours long. As I think back to some of the scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie, I forget why I included 'negatives' because it was so brilliant and I loved it as much as the first one. But then I remember the ending. it just didn't satisfy like the last movie did. I can't explain the nice feeling the first movie gave me: its what the perfect movie gives you I guess. Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who has scene the first one and anyone who would like a good crime/action/adventure flick with excellent acting with lovable and believable characters. It's a great movie, it just didn't live up to my expectations or the original's",8,60,98,27 December 2007
National Treasure," Excellent Historical Adventure
","I just watched this movie for the third time and it is such a spectacular movie. The action scenes were top of the line and the acting was terrific. Nicolas Cage shined as the lead, portraying Ben Gates, the persistent treasure hunter who looks for a long lost treasure. Diane Kruger held her own as leading lady and history enthusiast, Abigael Chase. In my opinion though it was Justin Bartha who stole the show as Riley, Cage's assistant. He had some great lines and actually influenced the plot as well as made you laugh. Jon Voight and Sean Bean were great in their supporting roles.I love learning about history and watching movies that have to do with history and this movie was top-notch. You will learn some very interesting facts about history.Combine this with one of the best scores I have heard since Pirates of the Caribbean and you have a tremendous movie treasure hunt that is definitely worth watching. Watch it and go along for the ride with Nick...you will not be disappointed.",10,0,3,14 April 2007
WALLÂ·E," Is this REALLY the best Disney/Pixar film?
","Let me start off by saying I have grown up with Disney/Pixar movies. The day a brand new D/P movie came out was like Christmas morning for me. And I was never let down. Ever. Toy Story 1 +2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, and Ratatouille all have amazing aspects to them that make them classics and some of the best family movies ever made. It is hard to pick a best one of these - they are all great in their own ways.That being said, I just finished watching Wall-E, the latest D/P 'masterpiece.' When I first saw the trailer, I was skeptical. It looked pretty stupid to me and I did not end up seeing it in theaters. After reading the rave reviews for it all over the place and the 8.5 rating on IMDb, I thought I would give it a shot.The first 30 minutes or so I was very confused. Some of the few other negative critics have used the word 'uncomfortable.' But, honestly, I thought it was stupid. There. I said it. Not even because it was not physically correct or whatever...or showed Liberal propaganda to children... but because it was just STRANGE. When EVE came it picked up a little bit. But one thing I have to say was that Wall-E annoyed me a little bit. OK - the first couple times he said 'EEEEEVE-uh' and EVE said 'wwwwwuuualll-EEE' it was kind of 'cute.' But after the 3 or 4 hundredth time, it started grinding on my nerves. I was not 'swept off my feet' by the 'adorable' romance of Wall-E and Eve. Again - a bit strange. I was really disappointed because I REALLY wanted to join the hordes of people who endeared this film, but I just couldn't. First 30 minutes - 3/10 As for the positives, OF COURSE the cinematics, visual effects, animation, art, and technical aspects were stunning. (I will say Wall-E was the best D/P movie in those terms.)A positive turning point came when we met the humans. I particularly liked the Captain for his bumbling, yet heroic aura. It was funny how they satired and exaggerated the American culture and what may become of it. It had a nice ending and an overall good story. I will not go into anymore of the positives, since the have been covered by the 70,000+ who gave this film a 9 or 10. For the rest of the movie I give a 7/10.But please, Wall-E doesn't come CLOSE to other D/P masterpieces such as Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story, Monsters, Ratatouille, and Cars. And best of animation of the year - Kung Fu Panda and Horton Hears a Who were both better. (OK - Wall-E WAS better than A Bug's Life - and Space Chimps).Again, I enjoyed this film and was thoroughly entertained by it. Also, I agree, it does reach a plateau in computer animation with its visuals. The story was nice. But a lot of it was just bizarre and definitely NOT D/P's best. Again I write these negatives with a heavy heart and I hope maybe if I let it 'digest' I will be able to comprehend what others have heralded as 'an incredible cinematic achievement.' Overall for Wall-E - 6(sigh)/10",6,4,8,10 January 2009
