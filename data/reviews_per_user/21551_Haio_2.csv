Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The difference between two films...
","There's a point in Volume 2, where The Bride/Black-Mamba/Uma Thurman is shot in the chest with a shotgun.  She flies back a few feet and hits the ground.  What happens next is unbelievable- nothing.  Blood doesn't fly 12 feet into the air.  But isn't this Kill Bill?  Isn't it the second Volume of Tarantino's blood saga of vengeance.  Yes it is, but then again- No it isn't.I don't know.  Maybe if it was somebody else- blood would have shot up. But nowhere in Vol. 2 do those annoying bursts make an appearance.The two films are so different that nothing I read could prepare me for how Vol. 2 would flow.  Considering I didn't like Vol. 1, this was very good for me.  Considering some did... well, this will test their loyalty to Tarantino- or just the KILL BILL saga in general.Looking back on Vol. 1 I can easy pinpoint many things I didn't like: The over-the-top-sickening anime sequence, the lack of depth, the lack of story, the lack of development, the lack of sanity... I could go on (you know I could)On Vol. 2, however, there is almost nothing I can say I didn't like. Anime- none. Depth- it's like the deep end of a swimming pool.  Story- told with massive heart. Development- so much it would sicken anyone who loved the first just for bloodshed.  Sanity- WELL, this IS a Tarantino film (Luckily, because Vol.1- well, its not a film if it doesn't take itself seriously, is it?)Thurman and Carradine who play The Bride and Bill (respectively) are unbelievably good.  Every moment they are on the screen a love-hate feeling just drifts... Their performances flesh out the characters who were empty in Vol. 1.  And, the fact that Tarantino decided to finally write helped.Ultimately Kill Bill ends as a drama, but spins back into Homage for the credits.  For those who stick around for the closing credits- you can see just how much fun Q & U (as they credit themselves) had just by the one outtake.Uma deserves an Oscar nod for this one, and if it's not too much of a stretch, toss one to Carradine for supporting.Before you see Vol. 2, ask yourself- 'Action or Story?'  Which do you prefer?  Because if all you want from Quentin is a bloody-mockery of a film, you might as well stay home and watch Vol. 1.",9,1,2,17 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Total Disappointment
","Kill Bill was my favorite movie ever.  Every article, poster, or clipping I could find I hung in my room.  This was of course, before I saw the film. Then came October 10, 2003 (A full moon).  I was bursting with excitement... then a bloody 2 hours later I was bursting in tears (sad tears).Sure, there are those who loved Kill Bill- why?`Oh, because it's funny.'  Riiiight... funny in a bloody-slapstick humor... Tarantino is capable of the best humor ever, but why didn't Quentin take the humor, the story, the acting, the MOVIE, hell- HIMSELF seriously?  Where is the trademark speeches and conversations? Huh?`Oh, because it's a tribute to the Grind house films', `It's a reference to old Hong Kong Action Films'.  Great... so WHY is it described as `The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino'?  Sure he WROTE it, he DIRECTED it, I'm pretty sure in Vol. 2 (Which is supposed to be GOOD) he'll even BE IN IT.  But, c'mon people, this is by no means a film BY Quentin Tarantino.",Null,7,11,13 April 2004
