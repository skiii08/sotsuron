The Lobster," Stupid movie.
",This movie is stupid because stupid people produce movies. Stupid people try to make smart movies but they can't because they are stupid.,1,1,5,23 July 2019
The Rocker," Good, funny, and entertaining.
","Rainn nails it. Christina is fabulous. The band is awesome. Good story with very funny and crude moments by Fish. One of my favorite all time lines... 'Go back to Cleveland, Cleveland!'",10,0,0,2 April 2020
Us," Doppelgangers Across America
","Started strong, was really spooky, and intriguing. Two thirds into the movie it fell apart. Turned into doppelgangers across America. The ending was stupid. If the little girl could leave and interact with regular people, why couldn't the rest just leave? No guards or locks... there was an escalator, WTF was keeping from leaving???",4,1,1,28 November 2019
About Time," Brilliant!!!
","It takes someone that has lived, loved, lost, stumbled, failed, and succeeded in life to appreciate this movie.",9,3,4,20 April 2019
Yesterday," Kate's gotta go!
","The movie, concept, and most of the acting was good. I especially liked the part when Jack first played Let It Be. My problem is Kate McKinnon. Like many SNL alumni, she is one dimensional and plays every role in the same manner. She's not funny and sours the movie.",7,2,4,11 March 2020
A Quiet Place," Great acting, buuuuuuut...
","Great acting and entertaining. So many plot holes. First of all, predators that use sonar to hunt prey would've picked off every person in this movie. Walking, moving, and farting make enough vibrations for predators to pick up. Secondly, there is still power and electricity??? That energy source comes from a noisy as F facility that requires human activity to produce electricity. It doesn't just magically appear. Predator monster aliens would've destroyed the power plant and all the humans.",5,1,2,27 August 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," A connection is made.
","Have you ever had a connection with someone that is stronger and more powerful than anything you've experienced in your life? If so, then you'll love this movie. If not, then this movie shows how powerful and rewarding that connection can be.",10,0,1,26 January 2020
La La Land," My favorite!!!
","So many things to say about this movie that are beautiful. 'How did you find me?' 'The house by the library.' When Mia sees the sign 'Zeb's.' The look on Mia's face as she runs out on her date to go meet Sebastian. The look on Sebastian's face when he recognizes Mia. And, of course, the little movie of what might have been if they'd stayed together. Love, love, love this movie!",10,0,0,18 May 2020
