Hereditary," A new intelligent horror masterpiece
","This movie is by far the best horror movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch...
It as everything a good horror movie needs to have, and at the end you walk out of the theater with that beautiful terrified ending in your head, and you cant wait to watch it again to understand all of it.
I really feel sorry for the people that are giving bad reviews and scores to this movie, really... This movie should already be considered a classic that revived the intelligent horror genre back to life...
