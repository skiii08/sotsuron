Skyfall," Argubaly Best Bond Ever!
","I went to see this film on the day it came out in theaters, and the seats were leather, the sound was so amazing, that I could feel every vibration of every gunshot or explosion! But what made the experience great was the movie itself. It has two knockout performances by Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem, Lots of action and laughs, and to top it all off, it threw some OLD Bond in the mix!While watching it, I listened to the sound of the people in the theater. They laughed, they gasped, they cheered, and at the end everyone applauded! So for me this could be the Best Bond Ever!",10,16,32,11 November 2012
Iron Man 3," What's Everybody's Problem?
","I watched this movie with my friend in the theater, and I thought it was fantastic! Iron Man 3 perfectly blends comedy, drama, and action. So what if it doesn't follow the comics? I kind of like it when movies don't go by the book and change things up to make it interesting. Robert Downey Jr. brings back the acting we saw in the first one, in the second one, he was really only playing the douche persona that is Tony Stark. The effects was really good, and I normally don't go for effects. Plus, without giving anything away, all I'm going to say is the way the movie wrapped up was perfect, it was a heck of an experience! I just ask that you don't listen to any friends who did read the comics, and just go and enjoy this great superhero movie!",9,18,29,28 September 2013
Django Unchained," Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece!
","When my sister came to visit, she and I decided to go see this film together. Sort of like a date. And I am a HUGE Tarantino fan, and was thoroughly looking forward to watching this. And their was not a second where I was disappointed! To show what this film got right, I'm going to break it down into columns.Acting: Jamie Foxx, Christophe Waltz, Leo Dicaprio, And Sam Jackson ALL turn in commanding performances! As they portray characters far different than the ones they've done in the past.Directing: What I found the most interesting was the cool as ice cinematography! The sudden zoom-outs, the cut-ins, and the classic circle shot last seen in Reservoir Dogs! Writing: We all thought that QT was robbed of the Best Original Screenplay Oscar with Inglourious Basterds, but he made up for it with all of the clever dialogue driving this film. To this day, if I say something wrong, I say 'I'd like to Un-ring this bell!' Now, I love Pulp Fiction, I love Reservoir Dogs, I love all of his works (With the exception of Death Proof which I like) I must say this.Django Unchained, is Quentin Tarantino's Masterpice!",10,0,2,30 May 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson's Best!
","This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen! Jack Nicholson delivers a powerful performance, and probably his best performance. I only recognized 3 actors in the movie, but the actors I didn't recognize surprised me! They all gave fantastic performances, and the nurse did a good job at becoming unlikeable throughout the movie! This movie had me on my seat, I mean I was laughing, then I was gasping, then laughing, then finally crying! But I must warn you, this movie is great, and funny, but it gets very heavy and emotional. So if you more sensitive, just be careful!",10,2,4,3 September 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," A Suspenseful Masterpice
","What separates this movie from other horror movies is, nowadays horror movies have lots of gore and blood. But this one had scary dialog, and real suspense. Hannibal Lecter really got me! I mean he was described as a psychopath and he looked calm, then he showed us his true colors!'Buffalo Bill' was crafty and crazy! The only thing he shows affection for is his poodle 'Precious' Clarice Starling proved that she has what it takes to be a professional when she used her skills to track down the sadistic 'Buffalo Bill'.For these reasons and more this movie will remain a suspenseful masterpiece.",9,3,5,4 August 2012
The Godfather," An Offer You Can't Refuse!
","Without a doubt, this is the greatest movie ever made!It has everything! A great cast, amazing acting, and an interesting plot! I am surprised that Al Pacino didn't win the Oscar because he put on an amazing performance. As well as Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar for his spectacular performance as Don Corleone. I heard a lot about the iconic horse head scene, and it still surprised me because that is NOT the way you want to wake up! After seeing this wonderful masterpiece, I am so excited to see the sequel!",10,0,2,21 August 2012
