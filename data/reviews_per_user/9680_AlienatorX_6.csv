The Incredible Hulk," Why did everyone forget this movie?
","How do you pick up the pieces from 'Hulk'? A remake perhaps? Instead they came up with a more daring plan, a loose sequel. This movie's opening credits are a recap of the last movie but at the same time not, things are slightly different and much less complicated then before so this film is actually both a loose sequel and a reboot. But instead of running us by the origin story all over again and wasting our time this film briefs us on the characters in the opening credits and then away we go for new adventures. This film is genius, unlike Hulk this film embraces it's premise and has fun with it, at the same time though it manages to be a more thoughtful movie then 'Hulk' but without sucking all the fun out of the enterprise. This movie does everything right but there are two things I have to give special attention to, firstly the effects are beyond awesome, some of the best CGI I have ever seen. Secondly this film's finale is the best ever: The Incredible Hulk vs. The Abomination in one of the best Superhero duels of all time. Two titans of pure physical strength duke it out in New York, and it is beyond awesome, the less I say the better but let me put it this way, Hulk uses a broken car as boxing gloves, What else can I say? One of my favourite MCU films and one of my favourite superhero movies period.",9,1,2,4 April 2016
Blade," Let's have a talk...
","I know this movie is considered a great superhero movie, a great vampire movie, a great action movie, a great Wesley Snipes movie and a great R-rated movie butI think it needs to be re-examined. On the one hand Wesley Snipes embodies the character of Blade, the action is great, the acting is great, and the film has numerous twists and turns, the thing that real hurts the films is the Vampire angle. For some reason we as a culture are obsessed with Vampires, they were beginning to wear thin when Twilight came out, and that with that mystifying international sensation and the supernova of Vampire fiction that came in its wake I can safely say I am sick to death of Vampires, no pun intended. Again and again and again and again, it's gotten to the point where they're not even intimidating any more, just boring. And here is no exception, if a vampire movie wants to survive it needs to be able to put it's head above the proverbial water and stand out but Blade just doesn't, no surprises, nothing new, nothing interesting, just generic Vampire stuff that manages to kill an otherwise great movie. I know a lot of people like this film a lot but I cannot see why, give it a watch but I am not a fan.",5,0,1,4 April 2016
Blade II," Just what this franchise needed
","Guillermo Del Toro. I am a HUGE fan of this guy, he is a creative force and one of the most versatile creative directors working today. After the success of the first Blade film a sequel of course got under way and the studio hired Del Toro to helm it, this was an odd choice at the time since Del Toro wasn't a household name but in retrospect it was a genius move because it took an awesome movie hampered by a cliché mythos and gave it over to a director who thrives on mythos. Before I can talk about the rest of the movie I have to talk about my favourite aspect of it. The Reapers. Good god I love these things; I love how they're look is inspired by Nosferatu, I love how their lower jaw splits open to became a bug like mouth, I love how they feed on both Vampires and humans, I love how they run sideways and on all fours like old Hollywood gorillas, I love the only Vampire weakness they retain is their weakness to sun, and most of all I love the scene where actually dissect one and we are allowed to see what makes them tick. Del Toro goes out of his way to make these things as alien as possible, not just in the way they look but in the way they behave, as one of the Vampires remarks 'they're as different from us as we are from humans', in typical Del Toro style there's something beautiful about them and yet profoundly disturbing at the same time. Everything that was good about the first film is here and better, the action is better, the story is better with higher stakes and all kinds of fun twists and turns, the acting is phenomenal; Wesley Snipes has allowed the Blade character to loosen up a bit and the other actors are all fun especially Ron Perlman, I also love the Elder Vampire Eli Damaskinos who is a classic monster inspired again by Nosferatu, a welcome change from the cliché 'vampire council' from the first film. This movie is great across the board, a great film for superhero film fans, action movie fans, sci-fi movie fans, fantasy movie fans, horror movie fans, Del Toro fans and fans of good cinema in general.",10,1,2,4 April 2016
Monsters vs. Aliens," A cool tribute and a great animated film
","I am a fan of Superheroes, I am a fan of b-movies, and so I love films that blur the line between the two, part of the reason is also because I think that a lot of those old B-movies could be remade as superhero movies very easily, you want proof? Sam Raimi's Darkman was inspired by old universal horror films and mad scientist B-movie, Wes Craven's Swamp Thing also blurs the lines a bit and you also have this movie. Aliens have invaded the earth, sending in a giant robot probe, after attempts to destroy it fail the government resorts to an alternate method; Monsters. For years the US government has been capturing and containing monsters the most recent of which is Ginormica, a to-be bride who is hit by a meteor which contained radioactive material which causes her to grow giant, she joins the team which already consists of Dr Cockroach, B.O.B, the Missing Link and Insectosaurus. Everyone of the monsters is a stand-in for some iconic b-movie monster; 'Missing Link' – 'Creature From the Black Lagoon', 'B.O.B.' –'The Blob', 'Dr Cockroach' – 'The Fly', 'Ginormica' – 'The Fifty Foot Woman', and 'Insectosaurus' – 'Godzilla/Mothra'. As a tribute to those old B-movies this film succeeds, the plot is over-the-top, the story is outrageous and the action is top. But this films succeeds on another levels, this movie is outrageously funny; the verbal humour, the slapstick are both done expertly and the voice actors are having a blast, top points to Hugh Laurie (yes, THE Hugh Laurie) as Dr Cockroach. And yet past the humour and the b-movie tribute this film also has its fair share of tender moments and it's kind of heartfelt overall. This movie is great: kids and adults will love it, proof of my theory that when Dreamworks are good they are fantastic. So where's that superhero remake of The Manster? What about The Amazing Colossal Man? Or The Indestructible Man? Octaman? Blood Freak? The Amazing Transparent Man? Come on studios! Most of these movies are in public domain for crying out loud! And there's no shortage of B-movie loving directors and writers, Make this stuff happen!",8,1,2,4 April 2016
X-Men: First Class," I don't understand what all the fuss is about
","Are we watching two different movies everyone? I have heard nothing but praise for this movie. Over and over again people crying that the X-Men movies are finally returning to their former glory (I think the MCU might have given them a bit of inspiration personally) and I've even seen this film on more then one list of best superhero films ever. Butit's really not that good guys. Now I know what people like about this film; the relationship between Xavier and Magneto. I agree it's well done; how they help to shape each other, how they get on so well, how they have similar goals and all that sort of thing. They really do work well together but their relationship is not enough to save this movie. Firstly the period setting is nothing short of pathetic; I've seen period Superhero movie (The Shadow, Captain America: First Avenger) and this movie doesn't hold a candle to them. If you didn't tell me it was set in the sixties I wouldn't have guessed because the move does such a poor job of convincing you that it's set in another time period. The villain in this movie is painfully weak and coming from a series that has brought us one of the greatest villains ever in Magneto having a villain this uninteresting is nothing short of criminal. In fact except for Magneto and Xavier all the characters in this movie are plenty bland. I'm also not a fan of the CGI in this movie; it seems to cover nearly everything in the film in this sheen that makes it look plastic. The racism thing manages to be even more ridiculous in this movie too; highlighted by one scene where a Russian ship and an American ship (literally seconds after the Cuban missile crisis) put aside their differences and turn their weapons on the mutants. That's just small child writing superhero comics level of stupid. Also am I the only one disturbed that every woman in this movie is portrayed in a sexual way? Every single main female character in this movie is in a sexual position at least once in the film. I can't be the only one that finds this troubling. On a minor note do you know who that red demonic looking mutant is? The one who's the main villain's sidekick? The one who can teleport? His name is Azazel. In the comics he's the last member of an ancient subspecies of mutants who created the human idea of the demon (he's also the father of Nightcrawler with Mystique but that something else entirely). Azazel is actually a villain in his own right and having him being a toady to a weak villain like this is nothing short of criminal; this is made even worse when you learn he was played by a British actor, not just any British actor but Jason Flemyng. This is such a waist I could cry. Overall Xavier and Magneto and great, five stars for them alone but the rest of the movie doesn't match up.",2,2,5,4 April 2016
The Wolverine," Criminal waist
","Considering how much I liked 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' I was actually exited about this movie; especially when I heard it was going to be set in Japan and have a lot of elements of a Yakuza film. I love Japan, especially in Superheroes. And in my naivety I thought there was no way they could botch this. Oh how wrong I was. Following the events of 'X-Men: Last Stand' Wolverine is living by himself and rocking a hobo beard up in Alaska. He is found by another mutant named Yukio who has been sent to find Wolerine. As it turns out he had an old friend from Japan whose life he once saved. The friend is now the head of a powerful Yakuza family but is also dying. Wolverine goes to pay him his last respects but gets caught up in all kinds of family power struggles. This is the set up to an awesome movie and in the hands of a different creative team it might have worked but not here, not with this director, not with these writers, not with these producers, and certainly not with this cast. I know Wolverine is supposed to be a bad ass but if you take out the word bad you're just left with an ass and that's what he in this movie. He's not the hero anymore, he's this obnoxious hero stand-in who we're keeping around until a real hero can be found. The Yakuza angle in this movie is way underutilized, sure there are some cool action scenes but they're shot so poorly and use so much CGI that they end up being boring. I should never be able to say that about a man with claws fighting a pair of guys on top of a speeding train, with katanas and guns! With the exception of Yukio and Wolverine, but only because there's so much of him, the characters in this movie are bland especially the weak villains, the worst offender is Madam Hydra who is technically an Avengers villains but she's also a mutant so she's kinda stuck in the middle and they apparently had to cut back some of her aspects which may be why she is so one dimensional; Poison Ivy from 'Batman & Robin' was more interesting because at least she had a personality. Wolverine's character development in this is nonexistent; his main thing is that he losses his regenerative powers briefly which might have been interesting if it was actually used but instead it just serves to try and make the fight scenes more interesting. This movie's cardinal sin is its run time, two hours but not like 'Lord of the Rings' where every minute is important but because Superhero movies are supposed to be two hours and so we need to pad this film out. This movie takes a perfect concept and completely waists it.",1,2,6,4 April 2016
