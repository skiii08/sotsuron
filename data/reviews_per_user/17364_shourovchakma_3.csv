Your Name.," More than perfection
","It will be a crime if someone doesn't give it a 10/10.
Mind blowing, thought provoking and a movie that will make you want to have a story like this to share in your real life.
And about the sound tracks!!!! Hats off !!! RADWIMP did something more than beautiful. The lyrics were so perfect with the plot and so does the music!!!
I just need to find a girl who is exactly this much crazy about this masterpiece like me.",10,0,0,29 January 2019
Captain Marvel," It's a must if you want to understand END GAME
","I would have regretted if I didn't watch it. Don't believe the ratings. It will be a crime to rate it below six.
Though there are many plot holes and the story line could have been better with such potential but still good enough.",7,3,17,8 March 2019
Joker," Way too OVER RATED!!!
","Just a pale story of a super depressed guy who gets bullied by almost everyone. Doesn't seem to have that kind of intelligence or smartness to check BATMAN'S intelligence.
No suspension or anything.",5,8,21,11 December 2019
