Resident Evil: Afterlife," Had more fun when my toe was septic
","Big fan of the underworld series... But this is just bad...no really... If you don't believe me give it a go....the skyscraper scene is pretty good but the rest is a matrix ripoff. Mila Ill always loved you...ever since when you spoke the word 'multipass' but this....bad! To write a review requires 10 lines but... but I might have to stretch it with nothingness...like the movie. The bad guy looks like 'agent Smith' from the Matrix, dodges the bullets the same way and pretty much uses the same lines. The scenes on the ship looks fake. The storyline is weak and the best acting comes from on of the infected standing on the roof 3rd row and just having his head blown off when trying to say his lines...sorry...Im gutted! Its not good!",1,22,35,23 September 2010
