Spartacus," Not Kubrick's best, and certainly not Trumbo's, either.
","Possible Spoiler?This is a fine movie, no doubt about it.  Douglas was performing as well as he ever did at this point in history, and it shows in the movie.However, while grand in scope and certainly original, Spartacus is still flawed.  First of all, the story is vastly over-romanticized, a fact due most likely to Trumbo's dialogue (which has a surprisingly high level of tripe, unlike most of his works).  Kubrick, for the most part is not in top form, although not bad.  Certainly the scene inside the holding area before the gladiator fight is extremely well directed.  Really (and I know others have mentioned this), the most important flaws is the romantic storyline, which, although gripping, is far too unrealistic and cinematized to be in a Kubrick movie.Nevertheless, a great film, and definitely worth at least one viewing.",5,4,10,13 February 2002
