Hereditary," Disturbing, painful, and absolutely terrifying
","About halfway through Hereditary I remember debating whether I knew I needed to see this movie again to decipher and appreciate its themes and details more, or whether this was a film I never in my life want to view again. At this moment I'm leaning toward needing a rewatch, but I'll definitely need to be in a certain mood for it. This is because Hereditary is absolutely one of the most emotionally painful and horrifying movies I have ever seen, and maybe ever made. The scenes of family drama are so gut-wrenching and powerful that they gave me chills, while the rest of the movie scared me worse than I have been scared since I first watched 'The Sixth Sense' when I was around 12 years old and basically pooped my pants. In fact, after being scared poopless by that movie as well as 'Insidious' and the second Paranormal Activity movie at a young age, I really thought I was immune to horror movies, as if they scared me so bad that nothing would compare to the fear I felt while watching them. Sure, movies like 'the Shining', 'Mulholland Drive', and 'Lost Highway' definitely had me shaken up at times, but I have not truly felt as terrified as I did while watching 'Hereditary' in a long long time. 
My IMDB account says I have watched and rated 248 horror movies and TV shows, and only rated 6 perfect 10/10s. I enjoy the horror genre, but I also know that I am very hard on it as well. When done right horror movies can be the among the most entertaining forms of cinema to watch, but more often than not they are done very poorly. I bring this up because I think it makes it mean more when I say 'Hereditary' is truly a 10/10 horror film to me. Yet to just label it a mere horror film is a major disservice. The scenes of family drama are so painful and lifelike that the only movie I can really compare it to is 'In The Bedroom', one of my favorite movies, yet I think even then Hereditary is a far more painful and heartbreaking watch. It is not paced like a traditional scare-fest horror film either. It gives out little pieces of information throughout its runtime to keep the audience engaged, but it never forces scares or even seems to feel like it has to be scary all the time. It would much rather keep you on edge by making you ask: 'who/what was that little ghost boy in the corner? What was in the mother's drink that got on her lips at her friend's house? Why does the little girl cut up birds? What does the grandmother's final note mean?' and much more. Some of these questions are answered soon after, some much later in the film, and some not directly at all. These little morsels of mystery, plus a commanding and edgy score will keep you on your toes throughout all of 'Hereditary's' runtime. And then when it feels like maybe you have pinned down the direction it is going in it hits you with one of the most shocking and unexpected movies scenes I have ever watched. I'm of course talking about the decapitation scene.
The trailers do a great job of making this scene feel even more like a misdirection, because the creepy little girl is the focal-point of all of them. Never in my life would I have thought that the film would kill her off in such a gruesome fashion less than 45 minutes into its runtime. When this happens you really think poop is about to hit the fan, but instead the film rakes you over the coals by making you a fly on the wall of a truly broken and destroyed family for nearly the next hour. And then the sÃ©ance scene happens, and at this point I had come to accept this movie as a masterpiece. I remember my eyes literally watering due to me be so afraid during that sequence. What makes it so scary is what makes the rest of the movie so scary as well: camera movement, the score, and incredible lighting.
This movie did not have a single true jumpscare in it, because it knew how to use the threat of a jumpscare to keep you nervous instead. Most of the film's scarier scenes consisted of long takes where the camera moves in and out of close-ups. Usually in horror films, these close-ups build up tension which is released through a jumpscare when the camera moves back out to a wide-shot. 'Hereditary' knows this, and instead decides that it is not going to use a cheap jumpscare to release the tension, and instead let the tension linger... and linger... and linger until you feel like your heart is going to bust. All the while, the score drones on and pushes you and the scene forward much like the score in last year's 'Dunkirk'. I'm also not an expert by any means in lighting, but this film's darkness and shadows feel so natural and realistic. You are constantly questioning the shadowy backgrounds thinking 'did I see something back there or is my mind playing tricks on me' much like you would do in real life. I have no idea how the lighting was done, but this along with the other two aspects I just mentioned are truly innovative and make this movie quiet possibly the scariest movie ever made. Yeah I'll just go right out and say it.
Don't forget that this movie is a hard R rating as well due to the imagery in it being so disgusting and disturbing at times. I truly think the scene of the daughter's decapitated head being devoured by ants as it melts into the side of the road, or where the mother bangs her head on the attic door like the demons in 'Jacobs Ladder' do will stay with me for the rest of my life, and those are only two of many absolutely screwed up parts throughout the movie's runtime. I know I'm just gushing about 'Hereditary' at this point, but I honestly have no problems with it except the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but it's hard to live up to the rest of the film's utterly brilliant writing so I don't really blame it too much. I mean the foreshadowing and layers upon layers of details in this movie could be dissected for hours upon end, and honestly after I see it a second and third time (if I can stomach it) that is exactly what I will do. This movie has the potential to be a future classic in my opinion, and I don't see how any other movie is going to beat it as my favorite film of 2018.",10,3,8,19 June 2018
Wind River," A grief stricken thriller
","I don't think it would be much of an exaggeration to say that 'Wind River' director/writer Taylor Sheridan likes creating neo-westerns. His screenplays for 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water' both encompass lots of the themes and settings of westerns and sets it to modern times, and this film is not so different. It is centered around a white tracker/hunter, played by Jeremy Renner, who is living on the titular Indian Reserve in Wyoming. Early on we learn that he is still recovering from the unexpected death of his daughter from three years prior, so when he finds a body of a dead girl he immediately is interested. Luckily for him, the new wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen. who shows up to take the case is in need of someone to help her navigate the unforgiving physical and social terrain of the reservation. This film does not play out like a buddy cop movie though, The characters and inhabitants of Wind River are all in pain in some way or another. I think this film is compelling due to its characters, setting, and story (I'm a sucker for a good police procedural thriller), but is let down in the way of direction and some acting. This film is bleak and character driven. It isn't until around 20 minutes into the movie that Jeremy Renner's character, Cory, finds the body and sets the events of the film into motion. The time up until then is spent developing his character and the pain he is going through of losing his daughter. Here some of the dialogue is kind of weak and too on the nose, like 'is that how sissy died', but overall it's still a welcome change of pace to movies that immediately drop you in on the action. Unfortunately what holds this film back the most is the directing. It's so f**king bland it's incredible. There's so much unnecessary hand-held, and so many weak cuts where scenes jump from one to another prematurely it is honestly quite frustrating. Yet by the time the tension filled third act of this film starts really heating up all my complaints for the film go right out the window. It's exciting, tense, and well shot. There's a style to be found in the action sequences that is just missing throughout the rest of this movie, which is a real shame as this could have been a 9/10 for me if the direction was just up to par. But that and some of Jeremy Renner's acting are the only things that really hold this film back at me. Yes there are some nit picks I have with it as well: like how nobody ever breathes out cold air even though it's supposed to be below freezing, and how sometimes the score ruins some of the tension (although for the most part I would have to say the score for this movie is pretty great) but these are minor issues and slight inconveniences at most. Overall this is an excellent film that explores a part of Modern America that is too often forgotten about or brushed aside.",7,1,4,3 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," clichéd as hell, cheesy as hell, good as hell
","So yeah I really liked rogue one, even though it somehow manages to hit almost all the things I hate in big budget action movies today. This film has some sh**ty characters and cheesy speeches about heroics and yadda yadda yadda. It has jokes that fall flat. It has so many moments that just are not good at all. But if you can get through all of that, this is a really great movie, especially visually. The action scenes are all well shot and exciting, preferring to use practical effects mixed with CGI rather than solely using CG. Honestly, besides one of those 'bad guy gets caught monologuing for no reason and dies because of it' and the over the top and sappy character deaths, I pretty much love all the battle scenes/fight scenes from this movie. The costume and alien designs also work really well , just like every other Star Wars movie.The characters in this movie I found overall more compelling and funny than in episode 7 (although many of them are still very underdeveloped, I personally enjoyed them), and many of them even existed in a morally gray area, which is unexplored territory for this franchise. In fact, this movie does a good job showing that not ever rebel is good, as well as the civilian casualties that are usually cast aside in movies of this nature. 'Rogue One' is also very funny at times, where only a few jokes fell flat. Compare that to 'The Force Awakens', where I think I actually laughed only a single time throughout the entire movie no matter how hard they forced jokes into it. The 'easter eggs' and callbacks in this movie are pretty obviously thrown in your face, but I still enjoyed them and am sure other fans of the series will spend hours jerking off to them, unlike me who only pleasures myself to the soft tears of orphans. The ending of this movie is also very good, and without spoilers I'll just say is a fantastic lead in to 'A New Hope'. Heck, even the CGI characters this movie 'resurrects' from the original trilogy look amazing (although not perfect just yet). Overall I actually love Rogue One, but its glaring flaws hold it back from being anything other than a solidly good movie. Oh, and this is probably a given at this point considering even the prequels did this right, but the movie's score is pretty phenomenal I'll give it an 8/10 or maybe a 7.5/10 I'm not sure yet why am I so indecisive.",7,1,4,17 December 2016
Zootopia," Lovable and flawed
","There are things I love about Zootopia, as this movie is really good about hitting the right marks. Idris Elba voice-work? Check. Relevant and funny social commentary on race and contemporary race relations? Check. AN EXTENDED GODFATHER JOKE?!? Super check! Heck even the size differences between the products and appliances the animals use and the way they are integrated together is pretty genius. And ohhhhhh the little details in the animals like the way the wolves cock their heads ti the side when confused is great!! So where does this movie mess up? For one thing it does the common kid movie trope of having irrelevant emotionally manipulative scenes complete with sad music for no reason other than to try to make the audience feel upset. There are some pretty big plot holes, like how did they not hear the wolves howling in the panther scene? How did they cut in front of the entire DMV? Also towards the end the movie seems to give up and just give away all the remaining mysteries as easily as it can in the narratively weakest way possible. But overall this movie is funny, decently animated, and a lot better than your average kids movie. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend people to definitely check it out.",7,2,5,24 April 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Very solid but somewhat overrated and held back by some bad choices
","Overall I love Martin McDonagh's filmography, and i really enjoy Three Billboards. It's funny, well acted, and (at times) quite compelling and well written. The character development of Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson's characters in particular are honestly one of the best aspects of any movie this year.The way McDonagh chose to film some of the action scenes (the best one being a long single take) is also very well done. Francis McDormand is also a lock for an oscar nomination as is Sam Rockwell. But this film has some glaring, ugly ugly ugly flaws that I'll go through.1. The CGI deer scene. My. F***ing. God. This scene is so cheesy and awful. The deer looks awful. McDormand's dialogue is awful. The entire scene is just cringe worthy, and, in case you did't guess it, awful. It's easily my least favorite scene of the year in any of the movies in my 2017 top films list.
2. Lucas Hedge is a terrible actor in this film, and I don't understand how. He was pretty amazing in Manchester by the Sea, but here in this movie he just seems so uninterested in even being in the film, even though his dialogue is quite well written and should be easy to portray. The scene where he attacks his father and threatens him with a knife is probably the most unenthusiatic and just plain terrible Lucas could have been in that scene. Every moment the film asks him to do anything he seems unable to convincingly portrait his character.
3. The Ex-husband's comic relief girlfriend is just so unfunny it's unbearable. The rest of the comedy in this movie is solid and feels Coen Brothers' ask, but she just seems like such a generic overly dumb character. I really don't understand what they were going for with her but it never once works
4. There is a scene I enjoy in the movie, where McDormand's daughter's supposed rapist confronts McDormand, and while the scene itself is quite good, I find it pointless within the overall context of the film. I think it easily could have been taken out and the movie and plot would remain unaffected.Although these critiques might sound harsh, I want to point out I still really liked this film. I think it takes a while for it to really get started, but the complexity of the characters and the sheer talent of the filmmaking and writing in general make this a must see of 2017",8,1,3,27 December 2017
Dunkirk," An exciting thrill ride that does justice to the real event
","There is a great gap between the opinion of general movie goers and more experienced film watchers when it comes to Christopher Nolan. Some people think he is a genius, while others believe him to be above average at best. I fall somewhat in- between those categories, but I think that anyone who loves movies can appreciate and enjoy his newest film 'Dunkirk'. I'm sure there is already a movement on the internet and on reddit to begin calling this film an 'instant classic', and although I won't go that far I will say that I loved this movie. If I had to put it into numbers, I'd say it's around a 9.5/10 for me. I'll start by discussing what drives the film. It's not characters, as they mainly serve as vessels for the audience to view this film through. In truth the characters are not super fleshed out, but this isn't due to them being shallow, but instead due to the fact that the film is sparse on dialogue. No, the score is what powers this film. More so than even films like 'Baby Driver', I think the score is the most important element of 'Dunkirk'. It is constantly going throughout the film, never stopping to let the audience catch their breath until the very end. It is sometimes more quiet and subtle, taking form as the sound of a ticking clock or light string instruments, and other times it ramps up its intensity to draw us into the action unfolding in front of us. If this movie isn't nominated for best original score as well as best sound mixing it will be a real shame. From the first gun shot on you know this film is going to blow out some eardrums. It's viscerally loud. SO loud that some people complain they could not hear the dialogue, but even though the British accents could be hard to understand I would never say it was too hard to hear them. Sounds instead of dialogue move this movie's story along, and seeing as Nolan is a pretty crappy writer when it comes to dialogue (for the most part) this is a good thing.Another thing I loved about this movie is just how real it felt, and I'm not just talking about the action. All the boats and planes seemed to be real and not CGI. Even as they crashed, exploded, and sunk into water. It all seemed so natural that I have no idea how he could have honestly filmed it without CGI, yet at the same time if the movie did use computer generated effects they were so top notch that I could not detect them. Due to this and the way they were shot (very up-close for the most part, almost to the point of them being POV shots) I'd have to say that 'Dunkirk' has the best aerial combat and dogfights of any movie I have ever seen by a long margin. But it's not just that either, but the uniforms and the beach and surrounding city itself just looked so amazing and authentic. It truly feels like you're just a bystander watching the chaos take place sometimes. The amount of actual planes, ships, uniforms, and extras Nolan must have gotten for this movie is just insane to think about. And overall it's all filmed so well too. The scenes of characters barely escaping drowning as their ship goes down is so pulse poundingly exciting and the camera is there up close to steadily film it all as it takes place.This film feels very lean to me. By that I mean not a single shot is wasted, nor held too long, and there is very little downtime for inner reflection or lulls in the action. When there are lulls, the movie tries to force in some seemingly bogus drama, like a character going blind and another character accusing someone of being a spy. I don't love these elements of the film as much, but by the end I do think they lead to some proper story-arcs and actually helped develop our characters. My only real problem with this film to be honest is a continuity error towards the beginning. The camera puts us right up close to a character as bombs are being dropped, slowly but surely edging towards him but stopping just in the nick of time. Then, the film cuts to a wide angle, and here we see no dead bodies or craters from the bombs' impacts. This is such an obvious and frustrating error that it confounds me as to why it was even included in the film. But as I said, I love this movie. The ending for Tom Hardy's character might just be one of my favorite moments in any film. I recommend 'Dunkirk' to anybody and everybody, even if you absolutely despise Nolan I think this film exemplifies his best traits and his ambitiousness as a big budget director while downplaying his flaws.",9,3,10,24 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," My favorite marvel movie (sorry Guardians of the Galaxy)
","This is probably my favorite superhero movie since the dark knight. Wow, I didn't expect this movie to be very good at all, and for once I fell like the fanboys are right and my expectations were wrong. I mean it's got well shot action, it's got Spider-Man, it's got decent character development, it's got Spider-Man, and did I mention it's got Spider-Man? I mean first off this movie does the little things correctly (for the most part), it has action scenes that you can tell what's going on (except for when they have to hide Scar-Joe's body double with shaky cam when doing some of her fight scenes), Chris Hemsworth seems to do most of his own stunts, and overall the fight scenes are very creative and action-packed. The superhero scene with every hero coming together for their big showdown is freaking amazing. Like besides the fact vision doesn't seem to do much of anything and doesn't even chase down Captain America once he starts to escape, every hero seems to be constantly doing something off-screen as well as using their powers in new and interesting ways on screen. The score for this movie is very well done, maybe not original but it's there when it needs to be, accentuates moments that it needs to, and shuts up when it shouldn't be there. The humor is toned down but still there, and besides some missed jokes from ant-man (and some from Spidey sadly) this movie still manages to be hilarious and the comedy is actually well timed for once. Overall the story and the writing for this movie are well above average. I loved black panther and spider man and their respective introductions. I thought the villains motivations were actually really unique, which made for one of the best superhero movie twists since watchmen. Yeah Iron Man is an asshole, and Captain America is pretty obviously right after you get into about an hour through the movie, but so what. The characters seem to stay true to themselves and I appreciate that. Overall this is the second Marvel movie I can say I love, and the only real movie I love so far this year (unless you count the Witch as a 2016 movie). I think anybody, even none comic book superhero fans like myself, to check this out.",7,3,8,9 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," definitely not the 'masterpiece/modern classic' it has been hyped up to be
","This is going to be less of a review and more of a rant, so let me get the good parts of the movie out of the way. It's competently acted, and there isn't a bad child actor in the bunch. It's also pretty well shot, with James Wan using long shots where the camera floats around and through windows and walls, giving it a feeling of omnipotence. Now for the bad.The intro is god awful. I'm not exaggerating when I say it made my entire theater erupt in laughter as Lorraine Warren pulled out in invisible shotgun to murder a family in a sort of dream-sequence. This accompanied by the fact that her hands are sped up every time she pulls the lever back to reload turn an intentionally 'intense' introduction into a self-parody. Next, this movie's CGI is also god awful. They were so lazy with so many parts that it's almost unbelievable how this movie has been made out to be a masterpiece by so many people. Instead of using a prop cigarette that produces smoke they said 'f**k it' and just made crappy CG smoke. Instead of using machines to produce fake snow or create realistic rain effects the crew must have decided that was gonna take too much effort so they instead just CG'd the rain and snow effects. And they aren't even good CG like in the fast and furious movies that Wan does. It's like he decided his VFX and FX crews should be made up of entirely by monkeys with down-syndrome. The 2spooky4me memelord skelingtons in this movie don't look any better. The possessed girl (yeah I'll get to the clichÃ©s of the story later) is completely CG, including her fake face veins and Sh**ty cat-monster eyes, and the evil nun demon monster that makes no sense has a Cg mouth tentacle thing that looks straight out of the resident evil movies that shouldn't be getting made anymore. But the icing on this @ss flavored cake is the amazing idea to put the skeleton from 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' in this movie, complete with the wonky frame rate that comes with claymation that makes things look like they aren't really moving right. It doesn't make sense on an artistic level (cause it isn't F!^&%%!%^@CKing scary!), and even less sense in a real life level. The dog literally transforms into the monster in front of a little boys very eyes. Like if it has this power why did it decide to use it only right there and never again. That's probably more useful than just about every other monsters' power in this movie, yet it just decides to do it once and only for the spooks cause lol this movie is so scary right guys gosh James Wan u master of horror u. ALso CGI tree spikes killing major characters in hallucinations is definitely 100% super intense not fake looking at all gr8 job m8 8/8.OK for my favorite part, the story. It. Doesn't. Make. F**king. Sense....... Like I've seen so many message boards trying to understand certain motivations and all I can think is 'guys. No one writing this movie gave a sh!t. There is no explanation...'. So first off the main antagonist is valak or whatever and he can only be defeated by finding out then saying his name yadda yadda yadda clichÃ© clichÃ© clichÃ© sure whatever. Now this nun monster valak enters the movie in physical form to terrorize Lorraine Warren once in her little spirit world, and once inside her house (btw the house scene, this movies so-called 'scariest scene of the decade', is absolutely retarded. the demon literally grabs a picture, uses it as a face, and runs at Lorraine while both its hands are still holding the picture. It looks like those kids that try to do Naruto ninja running because their parents don't love them). Now you might be saying, why does she do that? Well wouldn't you know it, the house the Warrens investigate just so happens to be terrorized by Valak. So Valak must have been f@cking with Lorraine to try and draw her and her husband to the house right? Except as soon as they get to the house the demon tries to make it look like the family is faking everything, and therefore tries and almost succeeds in making the paranormal investigators leave. What was the point in haunting Lorraine then? If it wasn't to draw her to the house the only explanation can be just to scare the audience. In fact drawing them to the house only leads to the demon being defeated. There is absolutely no reason Lorraine should be seeing this ghost unless it is through some kind of ghost world logic that the movie never explains. If that is true then it's pretty f*&#*cking stupid to not explain a major lore/plot element like that to the audience once... God this movie makes me want to jump off the roof of my house more than everyday life already does so i rate it 3/10 don't see it unless you want cancer I hope somebody actually reads this big wall- of-text review",3,46,88,1 July 2016
Gone with the Wind," The definition of a classic
","Over the weekend I was given the opportunity to see Gone With The Wind in theaters with my parents for its 80th anniversary. It's kind of embarrassing to me that I, a self-professed lover (and at this point addict) of cinema, hadn't yet seen a movie that is universally considered one of, if not THE best American movie ever made. Part of me had always been turned off by its 4 hour runtime, as I am in college and don't often have the time to sit down and watch a movie in a single 4-hour sitting. But another part of me had shied away from Gone due to all the blatant racism in it that I had been warned of. I had wasted my time watching D.W. Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation and did not want to sit through another slog of a film that is great technically but ruined by its subtext. So when I sat down in the theater I was hesitant but excited. And yes, Gone With The Wind is undoubtedly racist, but it is also so much more, and the fact that it can be both great while having all of its apparent flaws is the very reason why it is undoubtedly a classic.
The first thing that struck me about the movie was just how gorgeous it was. The painted backgrounds, the costumes, the set designs, all of it was just so intricate and colorful. Even now thinking back on it Gone might be one of the top 10 or so best looking movies I have ever seen. I especially love the mind boggling scale of the sets of Atlanta, especially that long sweeping shot that moves back to seemingly show endless miles of soldiers laying wounded on the ground. The juxtaposition of the bloodied soldiers mixed with our main character wearing a beautiful dress is poignant, and it is definitely one of the greatest images in any movie ever made. From a technical standpoint, the only thing I really dislike about this film is two or three scenes with really bad looking rear screen projection, which is honestly more a of a nitpick seeing as just about every movie back in the day used rear screen projection or something of the sort. I guess those few moments just stick out worse when everything else is such an unblemished visual delight.
What really blew me away though, and what makes this movie a true classic that will remain 'ageless' is the strength of the writing. This movie was so dark that I could not believe it was made in 1939. How it managed to sneak in things like rape and on-screen child death through the censors of the time shocked me, and I'm sure was even more shocking for the audiences at the time. Besides dark moments, the story as a whole hinges on a very psychologically unhealthy romance between two characters that are just plain bad people, and are never really painted or made out to be anything else. Our main character, Scarlett O'Hara, is surprisingly deep and nuanced. Being a woman in a 'man's world' she uses all the tools at her disposal to get what she wants. She seduces men she has no feelings for and uses them and their wealth to get what she wants. She is cruel and uncaring; she doesn't shed a tear for her two husbands that die and uses unwilling prisoners that she allows to be abused as essential slave labor to run her business (though the movie makes sure to point out that they, of course, treated slaves so much better than these men and their slaves just loved being slaves so much). Through all of this though, she remains likeable and I found myself time and time again routing for her. Her vow at the end of the first half of the movie to 'never be hungry again' is one of my favorite movie monologues. She starts out as a bratty and selfish little girl, and ends the movie is a strong and unbreakable woman. Her love interest and eventual husband, Rhett Butler, is an equally complex and flawed character who grows throughout the film. He's a womanizer who routinely is found at a brothel, and overall is just sort of an a-hole, although he's quite the charismatic a-hole. At his lowest point, he accidentally pushes pregnant Scarlett down a set of stairs and inadvertently kills their unborn child. After this he becomes a bitter man who, fueled by jealousy and depression, turns into an alcoholic before finally leaving Scarlett. Throughout all this he time and time again shows himself to be a redeemable and somewhat chivalrous character, as hypocritical as that may seem. He goes to fight a battle for the South just because he sees it as his duty and nothing more. He saves the man who Scarlett loves more than him just because it is the right thing to do. Overall the interactions and broken romance between him and Scarlett makes up the crux of the story, and these interactions are about as complex as the characters themselves are. They are both also played wonderfully by actress Vivien Leigh and actor Clark Gable who, while not reinventing acting like Brando, are both amazing in their own rights, especially for the time.
However, like I said this film is undoubtedly racist. The 'maid' in the film, who is simply a house slave in the vein of Samuel L. Jackson's character in Django Unchained, is essentially a racial stereotype (like every black character in this film) who speaks in 'jive' and is played for comic relief. Still, her character is legitimately funny and her actress Hattie McDaniel truly plays her well and gives her a deep emotional range that makes her a better character than she seems to have any right to be (McDaniel ended up being the first African American to win an Oscar for acting for her role in this film). Other scenes allude to some of the major characters being part of the KKK and going on raids to 'clean up' areas of lawless criminals AKA poor black people. The second half of the film is even a tirade against Northerners and Democrats o as Gone sees them as: carpetbaggers. Throughout the film every aspect of the Deep South is romanticized to the extreme. Yet, none of this could detract from the overall film too much to me. Just like McDaniel's character 'Mammy' is likeable even though she's inherently flawed in the way she is written, so is this film. I can't ignore this film's ignorance, but I also won't let it damper this masterpiece for me.
Some of my other flaws in this film that don't really have to do with racism are as follows: Prissy is the most obnoxious character I have ever seen. Besides a few comical moments that somehow work, she's beyond annoying and her loud voice constantly sounds like nails on a chalkboard for the few scenes she's in. Sometimes the pacing also isn't great, and a couple of times before the intermission I found myself a little board. That's honestly about it. Sure the acting isn't great from lots of characters, but that's just a product of the way acting was done at the time. Now, what else do I love that I haven't mentioned? I love the score. It's just simply fantastic and bombastic. I love the poster and want my sugar daddies out there to buy it for me. I love the complexity and ambiguity of the ending. Heck I even love this movie's love triangle. I love really everything about this movie. My gut reaction was to give it a 9 out of 10, but in the process of writing this I'm probably going to move it to a 10/10. There's nothing I can say about Gone With The Wind that has not been said millions of times before by people much more qualified than I, but I don't think it hurts for people to keep writing about this movie. Classics like this deserve to be written about and gushed over.",10,4,5,8 March 2019
Get Out," A great first film from Jordan Peele
","Get Out is a new horror comedy from one of the minds behind the hit series 'Key and Peele', although this movie is less of a comedy and more of a straight up suspense film. I thought this film was fantastic. It was always apparent from the direction of 'Key and Peele' that Both Jordan and Keegan-Michael understood directing very well and could easily satirize bad directing, but I never knew how that would translate over onto a serious attempt at making a film. That is until this movie. From the moment Childish Gambino's 'redbone' began playing I knew I was in for something special. This is the best first film from a director I have seen since last years 'The Witch'. It knows how to create suspense through things like mood and score rather than overused constant jump scares and other weak techniques. This film utilizes a foreboding string score to ratchet up the tension and it never really lets up. The acting is also amazing. Each actor does a perfect job of either portraying fear or lynchian esque creepiness. Just watch the 'conversation' that takes place between the movies main character and the house maid. Listen to the score. Notice the low , up-close camera angle. 'Get Out' knows what it is doing and how to put its audience on edge. In fact, both people I watched this film with were grabbing onto me and refusing to let go pretty much the entire time. It does have issues that hold it back. There is a scene of horrible CGI fire that made me and my girlfriend both say out loud something along the lines of 'wow that looks like dogsh@t'. There is another scene that makes no sense, and without spoiling I'll just say it has to do with an open door leading to a bunch of photographs that have no reason of ever being so blatantly left around. Finally, the ending happens too fast and while it is oh so satisfying, it blows its load too soon and quickly. Don't let any of that deter you from seeing this movie though, whether you are a horror fan or not. Whether you are black or white. Liberal or Conservative. This film is for anybody who can appreciate film or at least loves being scared. I give it an 8.5/10 and it currently stands as the best film of 2017",8,9,18,20 March 2017
A Quiet Place," I wish I had loved it like most other people seemed to
","I was very excited when I walked into my college town's decrepit movie theater to see 'A Quiet Place'. The first trailer really sparked my interest in this movie, and although the next couple of trailers and teasers definitely decreased my hype in this film, its great scores from critics as well as the word of mouth reviews for it really helped raise my enthusiasm for it to high levels. Maybe it was unfair to be so hyped for this movie. Maybe it couldn't ever live up to my pretty lofty expectations. At the same time though, there is no way in the world that this movie deserves an 80+ rating on Metacritic and a near 100% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes. The biggest problem for me is that for a thriller/horror film, this movie does very little to establish and use tension. It doesn't have an effective score like last year's incredible 'It Comes At Night' does to keep its audience on their toes. In fact, lots of the movie has no score whatsoever, which can also be used to really ratchet up the tension. Unfortunately, this film does almost nothing with sound design and background noise to try to be scary either. Think about the droning of the whooshing winds in many Lynch films like 'Eraserhead', or the sounds of the aliens breaking into and rummaging around in the house during the (far superior) invasion film 'Signs'. These movies know how to be suspenseful without even showing anything scary on screen, but 'A Quiet Place' has no clue how to do this. It prefers to just be completely silent at points instead of being nerve-racking. I like that the movie isn't scared to be nearly silent and dialogue free, but it shouldn't come at the expensive of removing the audience's fear and suspense. It also screws up by fully displaying the creatures early on and throughout much of the film. I know this is about as cliched as can be, but look at how effective Ridley Scott's classic 'Alien' is at disguising the titular Xenomorph. Never, throughout pretty much the entire movie, is the alien unobscured or fully seen. It hides in the shadows and lets us use our imagination, which is far scarier than anyone (even the brilliant mind of H.R Giger, who essentially inspired most of Alien's design) can come up with. Imagination is and always will be scarier than anything that can be shown on a movie screen.This movie is also poorly written and cliched as (bad word that imdb won't let me say). It has the typical dumb kid at the start who honest to God is just the worst. It has a bratty little girl who is pretty much a (bad word for female dog) because it's convenient for the plot (even though the movie tries to use a very generic excuse as to why she's allowed to be an angry little brat). At one point the monsters kill a character right next to a car, and instead of just being silent in the car the characters just (bad word) drive away in it, and somehow these inconsistent as (bad word) monsters don't hear them. I'm sorry, but no matter how much (bad word) sand you put on the ground, or how hard you try to muffle your stupid baby's screams two feet away from these things, they should be able to hear you with their supersonic sound detection that can hear a freaking metal object hit the ground a billion miles away. It's just so inconsistent that I just could not suspend my sense of disbelief any longer. Also, this movie has the most generic, cliched, and cringeworthy movie ending I've ever seen in a so-called 'masterpiece of horror'. It has an overdramatic zoom into a character's face, a cringe inducing one liner, and a fade to black. I'm not exaggerating when I say me and about 7 of my friends (who all actually really enjoyed the movie) all busted out laughing at this garbage of an ending. And this isn't even mentioning how (bad word) cliched the monster's weakness is. Like seriously, watch the trailer, take what you know from that, and guess the most generic and cliched weakness the monster could have. You more than likely guessed correctly. I honestly do not think that Jim from the office could have had a more generic take on this concept if he tried. I don't hate everything. The movie is pretty well/competently acted by everyone involved (although the kids are not really asked to do much here). There are a few genuinely squeamish and 'nail' biting scenes scattered throughout this movie. It is boringly yet competently made from a purely directorial aspect. The CGI monsters actually look pretty amazing for the most part. But man oh man, this movie could have just been so much more. Overall I think 'disappointingly average' is the best term I could use to describe this film.",6,2,3,17 April 2018
Kick-Ass," This movie is fun
","OK so if you're going into kick-ass expecting it to be on par with movies like 'citizen kane' and ' there will be blood' then wtf is wrong with you. By its name alone you know this isn't going to be some great masterpiece of the 21st century cinematic experience, but you should at least go into it with the hopes of just having a good time watching a movie. And trust me, most people will have a blast with this one. It's funny, very violent in a stylistic way, and overall pretty well shot when it comes to action and fighting scenes. The main character becoming a masked vigilante is handled in a comical but non-cheesy way, and overall the characters in this movie always add something to the experience when they are on screen, whether it be Nic Cage's role as the sweet but batsh!t father (I mean come on you should be sold on this movie by the fact alone that ole Nic is here ready to spread some crazy acting cheer), or the main character's nerdy but hilarious best friends. So that's a quick and basic summary of what I did like, now on to the issues. If you are madly in love with this movie and are going to hate someone else criticize it then this is where you should walk away from your keyboard and put your butt-plug back in. OK so first off the first scene of this movie is a dude jumping off a building to his death. Yeah not sure if that's a spoiler or not. Anyways, the way he landed after he feel is completely impossible (trust me I'm a scientist and nobody on the internet ever lies). Like I diagrammed it out and I'm pretty certain he couldn't have possibly landed the way he did. OK so that's more of a nitpick, so here's my real issues. This movie does one of those love story things. It's meant to be funny, but there comes a point where the characters act all lovey dovey and their dialogue is so cringe worthy and clichéd that I have no idea why it was put into the movie to begin with. Like seriously, I'm glad we got a minute long scene consisting of 'I care about you babe.', 'no babe, I care about YOU'. The movie also uses the 28 days/weeks later theme song during a fight scene, and it just feels completely out of place and awkward, at least to me. I'm sure some people will enjoy it. Alright rapping this semi-rant up, another spoiler is inbound. So during the end the characters fly away in a jetpack. This is fine and all, but the animators forgot to CGI cars onto the ground. Like one shot the street is empty, and then the next shot its completely filled with traffic. Like that's just bad attention to detail. So that's about it. This movie is what it wants to be and for the most part it is well done. I'd recommend it to any casual movie viewer wanting to have a fun movie night. 7.5/10",6,0,0,4 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," How not to make a super-hero movie
","Have you ever watched a movie where every character without exception could have scored lower on an I.Q test than an autistic rabbit? Now try watching one of those movies that doesn't have Vin Diesel in it... It's unbearable. Everything about the amazing spider man 2 is so stupid it boggles my mind that a group of people getting paid millions of dollars thought this stuff up, wrote it down, were OK with it, then everybody they showed it to also was OK with it. Take the ending for example: spider-man fights the rhino. So this idea seems like it could go many ways, but here is what the fine writers behind this movie came up with for it. First off the rhino must be played by an overweight paul giamatti and he must use the most stereotypical Russian accent possible. Next, crowds have to be standing no less than 100 feet away watching as the rhino shoots his .50 caliber machine guns at police officers, and no they do not ever appear worried for their own safety. Then once spider-manchild comes to the rescue rhino better give him a full 30 seconds to make a speech and crack a joke before firing at him because this is a sh!t movie after all. Oh and by the way we don't get to see this fight scene, it cuts off right before the two come in contact with each other. Did I mention this entire scene was in the trailer for the movie. Yeah I don't think anybody involved in this film actually gave a fvck about it in the slightest. Even this score to this movie is laughably bad. Just listen to the dubstep that comes on every time Jamie Fox's villain decides to show up on screen and display his full spectrum of autism for the world to see. I'm sure some 55 year old board room member went 'yeah dubstep. That's what the kids are into... Fvck this movie up with some dubstep guys!' There's way too many flaws to type in this review, so I'll mention the few pros... Some interesting and well filmed action scenes. Andrew Garfield does really well in this film. That's about all I've got. So yeah this film gets a 4/10. Thanks for ruining green goblin by making him more like a herpes ridden goblin who gives bjs at truck stop bathrooms for whatever money you got in your pocket,",3,1,6,24 May 2016
The Witch," Best horror movie of the 2010's
","The witch is a slow burn. It isn't filled with spooks and scares, but instead relies on an atmosphere of constant tension created by the Gray and barren landscape and its subtle yet foreboding string instrument score. This is the work of an up and coming great director who seems to understand directing much better than just about any horror director as of late. The camera stays pretty still the entire movie. There are no tracking shots, no 10 minute one-take scenes, and besides a scene in the beginning with the family leaving Jamestown colony, I cannot recall the camera moving much at all. This lack of movement helps emphasize the isolation that the family must be feeling throughout the entirety of this movie. Now most people I assume won't enjoy this movie at all. Nothing is spelled out for the audience(even the dialogue is accurate to the time- period, so it is not easy to understand, especially with their heavy accents). The 'witch' itself is never given a concrete form , which I'm sure will also frustrate people, and the ending is very ambiguous and maybe even anticlimactic, but for me it worked. This is a film that begs to be seen multiple times and dissected. From the family members each mirroring one of the deadly sins, to the fact that this movie may or may not have unreliable narrator syndrome, the witch is a s=dense film. Besides some minor pacing issues and some bad choices when it comes to background/ off screen noise, this movie is a near perfect period piece horror film. A solid 9/10 and the movie to beat in 2016",9,5,10,18 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Zach doesn't have your back this time
","I feel like I'm one of the few people who actually likes Zach Synder. Yeah his movies have the depth of a puddle, but his sepia- looking visuals combined with (usually) very artistic CGI make for movies that are at least enjoyable to your eyeballs. But yeah man, I can't defend you on this one bud. I didn't even have really any expectations for this movie, and you still managed to disappoint me somehow.This movie is book ended by sh!t. The opening voice over monologue is probably the worst movie speech I've ever heard. It's pretentious. It has nothing to do with the plot. Its.Just.Stupid! The ending is just as bad. Spoilers: Super Man dies!!!! Jk of course he isn't really dead how would we finance the sequels without trailers of superman and Ben Affleck homo erotically pushing each other around? Instead batman decides in a single scene that everything the movie has built so far about his complete hatred for superman has been completely irrelevant because superman yells out 'Martha' like some BDSM masochistic safe word. Yeah talk about a big fvck you to any audience members still invested in this movie's characters. Look I could go on and on about the sh!ttacular plot. I could complain about how useless Lois Lane (or however it's spelled) is in just about every situation. Or how it's retarded for batman to put a tracking device on a car only to immediately get in his CGI death car and mow everyone down in his way (including an innocent oil tanker truck driver) even though that's the same exact reason he hates superman. I could say it's useless for Lex Facebook to carefully and precisely and slowly cut off General Zod's fingerprints when he could just cut off his whole hand. I'm not going to say any of that though, I'll just type it on an online message board instead. Look the plot and structure of this movie is terrible. There are no less than four dream/hallucination sequences and none of them make any fvcking sense whatsoever: in one the flash, a character who is never even introduced, goes back in time to communicate to batman in batman's dream (cause that's not retarded), in another batman sees his parents grave bleeding black goo only to have the Faun from Pan's Labyrinth jump out and kill him. Look overall the dream sequences are probably my favorite parts of the movie ( in one batman has a tracking shot fight scene against Nazi superman soldiers under a recent nuclear explosion.) but overall they make no sense and have no effect on the plot at all. They could have been taken out and the story would have remained the same: fvcking stupid. Now the CGI in this movie is bad. Really bad. I mean the bat car looks like it was pulled out of a 1995 hot wheels video game made for kids whose parents didn't love them enough to play hide and go seek like jimmy's parents would always do (no I'm not bitter). Doomsday looks great. Everything else... not so much.Finally the editing in this movie is pitiful. There's no tension (except for one scene that we don't understand why it's intense until a briefcase explodes), no establishing shots to allow us to take in the scenery or even know wtf is happening. Sure this is just like Zach's first attempt into the superhero genre, watchmen, but I actually like watchmen so you're not allowed to criticize it.Overall: 5 or a 5.5/10. Why you do dis Zach. I love you bb pls.",4,0,0,6 April 2016
Beowulf," I really wanted to love it
","spoilers, but I didn't. there are things i really liked this movie, but they are few and far between. Overall this movie is just generic. It's score is pretty much the score of Shrek. yeah... Shrek... The movie that was parodying fairy-tales. That isn't a good sign for a fantasy movie. The characters pretty much fit under the general fantasy archetypes. The drunk and incompetent king, the brave but flawed warrior, the bitter queen, the good friend to the hero, the evil seductress of a villain, and so on and so forth. honestly if it wasn't for this movie's animation style there would be nothing special about it at all.But that's what i do love about the movie. It's animation allows for the monsters to look real when compared to the human characters, and the artistic vision these animators had for Grendel is perfect. No he isn't the monster from the story, he is the monster made for this movie. he's gross, speaks incomprehensible olde English, scream yells and whines, and generally is just gross. The dragon that shows up later in the movie is kind of generic, but he is well animated and well detailed.overall, Beowulf is an average 6/10. Don't ASK ME WHY THAT'S MY AVERAGE SCORE INSTEAD OF 5 CAUSE I DON'T KNOW. Just kidding I know I'm the only person that will ever read this review",5,0,1,29 March 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Like two completely separate movies mixed together
","This movie is a painfully average picture filled with great battle scenes. The acting is fine. Hugo Weaving does a great job as the drunk a**hole dad and everyone else is passable (except maybe those cringy child actors who cant fake a hit to save their lives). The lighting is horrible. It's painfully obvious that every non-battle scene has a sh*tty looking bright filter put on top of them all, which really makes no sense. Why would you make the film seem so fake when all the battlefield scenes are made to seem extremely realistic? Let's not forget how cheesy the story is too. It's the clichéd awkward boy meets cute girl, they fall in love, and then their plot is completely dropped from the story just like every single other subplot in the film. The film makes a huge jump from our hero surviving the threat of getting court martialed by the meany military men to straight into battle. I mean I was thankful that we got to finally leave the godawful bootcamp sequence(which basically is a much worse version of Full Metal Jacket's bootcamp complete with Vince Vaugn doing the most unconvincing job of a drill instructor I think I have ever seen in a big budget movie) but the jump completely slices out every part of the story that it had just created and never reintroduces them back into the movie. Now compare the clichéd beginning of this movie (as well as the clichéd 'super patriot' ending) to the visceral and brutal battle scenes. It's as if this movie has two different directors. One is the real Mel Gibson, who basically sh*ts blood, guts, and mutilation on the screen for an incredible hour, and the other is Mel Gibson who lost his testicles and uses cable. Basically the film boils down to this (if I haven't already made this blatantly obvious). Battle scenes (besides the terrible CGI boats and cannons)= good. Dialogue, characters, and the beginning and end of the film = bad. Overall the film isn't as terrible as I am making it sound, but lets end this circle jerk of calling this the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. This movie isn't even the best war movie of the past few years. If you want to see what this movie should have been go watch The Pacific. 6/10 don't waste your money unless you just really love war movies.",5,8,19,25 November 2016
