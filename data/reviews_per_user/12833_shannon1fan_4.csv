Gremlins," Brilliant! Simply Brilliant!
","This a very Brilliant movie. Probably one of the best Comedy/Horror movies I have ever seen.WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS! An Inventor buys an adorable little creature. It is soooo cute!! He gives it to his son as gift. But there are some rules......Keep him out of the light. Keep him away from water. Don't feed him after midnight. Well, of course all these rules are broken, and before you can say 'Gizmo' the whole town is over run by these Gremlins. they don't stay cute and cuddly long. The turn into these demonic little green devils. The only thing that ticks me off about this movie is that 'Critters' has made a lot of money off the idea from 'Gremlins'. This is an excellent movie to watch. I recommend it.",Null,0,2,24 July 2001
Resident Evil," 9 out 10
","As most people who saw this movie, I am a huge fan of the game! Now, in a video game, it's okay to have puzzles and power-ups and going from one room to another and getting a headache from all the damn searching.When news came that the movie was coming out boy was I excited. Rumors went around that it would take place in the mansion throughout and like the game, take you down into the labs. Thinking it over, that would've made the movie stupid. Think about it. Going from room to room to room searching for a puzzle piece to move that fireplace blocking the extra ammo. That is stupid!!!! But taking place in the Hive itself...there ya go! Reading some reviews people are complaining about the lack of puzzles and herbs. Okay there WAS a puzzle in the movie!!!!SPOILER!When Kaplan is trying to open the door to the Queen's Chamber and trying deactivate the weapon defense system.END SPOILERThis movie get ass. Mila in a skimpy outfit kicking the crap out of dogs and zombies and whatnot. Hundreds of zombies and zombie dogs, a giant 'Licker' and a super computer that's trying to kill you. What more do you want?! The movie had sick but oh-so-amazing death scenes and monsters.I expected half the people who died to live on! What a surprise! This movie couldn't have been any better. The DVD kicks ass as well. Go buy the DVD TODAY!!!!",Null,0,0,5 August 2002
Halloween," Good, but not Horror Movie good
","I kept hearing 'It is a VERY scary movie!' and 'Oh so scary! You wont be able to sleep!' It was not scary. It takes a lot to scare me. If Whoopie Goldberg were in it, I would be having nightmares for my whole life. Anyhow, I liked the movie, yes. But it just wasnt horror movie good.Your basic slasher movie: Killer stalking and killing. Eventually stopped (or not). A babysitter babysits two kids on halloween night. During that time, the babysitter's brother stalks her and starts to scare her. Thinking its nothing she ignores it. Finally she gets chased, blah blah.",Null,0,0,18 January 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Most Excellent!
","The 80's seemed like the decade for comedy movies. I like some of the 80's movies but not all. 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' is one of my favorites. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* In this film two teens, Bill Preston Esquire, (Or something.) and Ted Theadore Logan are a two person band called 'Wyld Stylnns'. They soon find out that they are failing history class, and have to get a passing grade on the upcoming presentation in order to pass history. From the future, a man named Rufus comes to their time. He tells them that their band will be VERY succesful. But if they do not pass history, the world would be doomed. Using a time machine phone booth, they go back in time and pick up historical figures like Billy the Kid and 'So-Crates'. They also get to pick up some 'Bodacious Babes' saving them from 'Royal Ugly Dudes'.This movie is a great comdey to watch again and again. I can't believe I didnt see it sooner.",Null,0,0,11 January 2002
