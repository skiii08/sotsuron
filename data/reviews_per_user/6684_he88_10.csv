Catch Me If You Can," Great Movie, But Barely Follows The Book
","Yes I agree that this is a very good and entertaining movie, but I just finished the book and was looking forward to seeing the movie again after so many years. There's so many differences in the main characters and the story line that there's not really that much in common between the two. Still...It is a fun watch.",8,1,2,3 February 2020
Star Trek Into Darkness," Interesting
","I've looked a bit through the reviews and found those towards the end were in high praise and those towards the beginning very disappointed in the movie. All the dates are in May of 13 so I'm not sure how that plays out. I'm guessing that many of those who were really blown away by the movie saw it in a theater where they really got into the special effects, where maybe the others were watching it a home like I did and wasn't so dazzled by the effects.....Where the movie has to stand on it's over all merit. In that case it really does come up short. In that case it comes across as a poor attempt, and often a bit silly because there's not much meat on the bone without the special effects.",5,1,3,24 March 2014
The Aviator," A Trip Into Madness
","I saw this movie maybe a year or so after it came out, but I don't think I really appreciated it as much back then. I just watched it again from one of the movie channels and I'm really blown away at how good it really was.I know some here have mentioned Leonardo's portrayal of Howard Hughes OCD as being extremely good. I found it to be almost too god because as Howard Hughes slipped further into madness it became more and more uncomfortable to watch because it seemed to ring true. Without a doubt he captured the Howard Hughes we've seen from public clips, but also the Howard Hughes as reported by others. What a great study.",10,2,2,12 February 2020
Jarhead," Broken Jar
",It's amazing how many times lately when I've looked at reviews I find outstanding reviews in the 8 to 10 stars level....Until I dig deep where all th 1 to 3 star reviews are. None the less this movie really went down hill fast after a start that was reminiscent of 'Full Metal Jacket' in the boot camp section. Once they deployed it became less of a war movie and more like a frat club. I just got bored and disgusted with this frat house mentality so I tapped out. Maybe it got better later. I have no idea because it really stunk about a third of the way in,2,1,2,22 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Watch This One Before Reading Reviewx
","Although that's pretty good advice for most movies I think it is especially fitting here. I read the reviews and on one side people absolutely loved it, and on the other side....They gave very low marks because they just didn't get it. That's too bad because if they did then they'd realize what a great movie this really is. It's history is most interesting to us Boomers because we were teens and twenty somethings during this era. The look at Hollywood from a behind the scenes look of what it must be like to watch your career start to fad as you find less parts offered to you.In the end this is much like the title suggests...It's a 'Fairy Tale.' I can guarantee that you will find yourself a bit surprised about the ending. Did you like the way 'Inglorious Basterds' was a history you'd have rather had? Well the same with this Fairy Tale.....An ending you really wish had happened.",10,13,21,29 April 2020
Black Snake Moan," Reality Often Isn't Pretty
","I watched this a year after it came out, and again last night around 11 years or so later. It's an interesting story about some broken people who eventually discover that healing really only happens when you go outside yourself and help another...Something a recovering addict like myself can understand perfectly well. It is definitely gritty and not for everyone. Christine Ricci is really a damn good actress. I thought so when I first saw her in the Adams Family. In this movie she is so convincing as a terribly broken little girl in a young woman's body. At first we just see her as a sex addict living a very risky life style that nearly kills her. Eventually we glimpse that inner terrified child and can't help but to be empathic towards her. That's some real acting chops there. Then again she was surrounded with a lot of major talent so there was plenty of acting chops to go around. I really liked this movie",10,4,5,27 January 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," Much Fun
","I gave this a ten because everything was just done well (Or well done at times too)I only seen this on HBO so I didn't get the full theater and 3D effect, but even so it was a fun movie for the whole family. There's an underline message about perceptions and prejudicial attitudes, but it's not something in your face. The other thing that makes this so enjoyable is the animation itself. The animators have come a long way in really making the human subjects movements and actions seem really human. Even facial expressions is right on. On top of that they managed to get some good acting voices and everything just pulls together well. It's really just what it's supposed to be...Just a lot of fun....",10,0,0,24 May 2011
There Will Be Blood," Nothing Like The Book 'Oil'
","I had seen this movie several years ago, but I wasn't too excited about it because Daniel Day Lewis played such a dark and sinister character. So I had just finished the book 'Oil' that this movie was supposed to have had at its base. So I had the movie on my DVR and figured it might more sense after the book. The only connection there was to the book was maybe three or four minutes worth around getting the land and starting the first well. The rest of the movie (Including the beginning) was nothing at all like the book. In the book the oil man and his actual son were a team because he wanted his son to take over the business. Actually the book is based around the son and it is also based around real historic events in the early 1900's. This story was very disappointing. Had they made a story more like the book it would have been far more interesting than this was.",7,0,1,18 January 2020
Spectre," Where's The Entertainment?
",I remember when a James Bond movie was fun and entertaining. Half the time in this movie I was trying to figure what was going on. To me that's not entertainment. I see they have Danial Craig slotted for the next 007 movie in 2020. They need some serious restructuring if they hope to pull that off,4,0,6,18 November 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," Better Than Expected
",I wasn't too sure I'd actually watch much of the movie before deleting it from the DVR because generally those that are given so much attention for awards often fall short to me. I read here some are really upset about the gritty real life locations of some of the worse hell holes in the world where real poverty is a huge and nasty culture within the city. The poverty there make most poverty in the US seem workable by comparison. However; Without showing the life of trials just to stay alive on a daily bases this would have been a shallow film and hardly worth watching.....As it was I found it to be quite interesting all the way through.,8,1,2,29 August 2010
