Walk the Line," Well done but full of errors
",The consultants for this movie were not checking their facts properly-there's a long list on here of mistakes and some even they have not mentioned. Thus when Jerry Lee Lewis is shown at the dawn of Cash's career he'd only made one single-and thats if it was supposed to be 1956! Lewis Boogie never appeared till well into the 60s! And though Johnny Cash may have written a song called Rock'n'Roll Ruby it was not a Cash single at all but by Warren Smith! Its so easy to check stuff out now-Wikipedia is the obvious place. So many key events were missed out-like the anecdote told to Carl Perkins which inspired Blue Suede Shoes.Or the famous Million Dollar Quartet. Whether the fashions of 1968/9 were accurate I was pleased to see the June Carter character wearing the same sort of dresses-I hate minis. It was only a brief tour of the life of Johnny Cash in the 60s -should have been longer.I enjoyed it and would watch it again,9,1,3,26 February 2007
Monster," What a mess
",'Americ's worst female serial killer' it said in the TV mag.I'd never heard of this person and after watching it I thought it was just another excuse to fill the movie with foul language.If you try and count the number of F and S words you lose count in the first 20 minutes. As for the killings only 3 were shown yet if this movie had been done right you'd at least have heard gunshots.So no logic here. Instead we get stuff which should have been left out-like Ailleen's attempts to get a job when she thinks she can become a secretary in 5 minutes!! At the beginning she tells her friend she has a dry cleaning business or something but as we never see it we know this is a woman who lies non stop . I know America has low lifes like this-so have we-yet when you realise this person is the subject of a book and a movie that's more than obviously deserving people have-Gene Pitney or Carole King to name but 2. She must have been worse than the movie portrayed to end up being hung,2,7,15,8 April 2008
Hostel," Too long before the action
",3 guys on holiday in Europe check out the local hedonism to the point of what is no more than a pointless exercise in nudity and bonking.So far so bad. After that lot is over the real horror began when they visited a place called The Factory.The story had now become a case of living up to the blurb of 'the goriest sickest movie you'll ever see' which it began to do after the guys became separated and one by one were taken off to be tortured to death. Naturally there had to be plenty of artistic license taken here-the first guy and the one who ended up escaping after somehow finding he had a gun in his pocket-had his leg prodded with a drill and it showed it going through.When he finally escaped the film seemed to have forgotten he was supposed to be chained to the chair but later he was able to function as if he'd just tripped up-his shredded hand he covered with a glove he found in a cupboard. In reality the first jab with the drill would have killed him and no way could he have removed himself from the chair or even moved his hands around to produce a gun. But we live in an age where films can make anything happen like cartoons. The special effects were very convincing and very sick. But no way after that 50 minute waste of time in Amsterdam's Red Light district could this movie hope to be 100% horror,5,0,0,12 March 2007
The Mummy," A Keeper
","Its what a film of this kind should be about but it was well into the first hour I realised it was a comedy! The scene in the library where all the shelves fall like a stack of dominoes was priceless-amazing what trouble they go to just for a few minutes of nonsense. You had what might be called the serious entry into the story-the events of ancient Egypt where they buried people alive and went in for extreme punishments for stuff like adultery. I enjoyed watching the bugs thrown into the coffin where the adulterer had been wrapped up as a mummy and this is one of the cornerstones of horror-burying alive. The special effects were a case of no expense spared for a movie which was not ruined by foul language when there would have been cause for it with all that mayhem. You didn't think of all the impossibilities like endless supplies of bullets,fires underground which would zap the oxygen Thank God for artistic license You just enjoyed a movie which was entertaining",10,4,5,29 May 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," One of the best for Special Effects
","Where would filmmakers be without artistic license? New York is virtually under water yet everything's working-the electricity,computer screens,telephones.And everybody is being ordered to move South as if its just the next town! They get to Mexico believe it or not and suddenly there's the equivalent of a town in a Refugee Centre!How have they got there-there's no transport and for most people no money either it would have been lost with everything else Not only that but people are shown on skis or walking on the ice. But if logic and reality had been applied the film would have been quite boring. We saw what happened in New Orleans or the Tsunami or even Branscombe Beach-people go looting that's the reality.And its also a reality that there would be mass outbreaks of fighting and I don't mean with wolves. This in fact was a more realistic moment to introduce a pack of wolves as they would be well at home in this environment. But 8 out of 10-its a thoroughly entertaining film with wonderful special effects When the film's over it takes at least 10 minutes for the credits to roll up-an indication that a mighty lot of work was done just to make a disaster movie to entertain the masses.",8,1,2,10 February 2007
Independence Day," Keep telling yourself its only a movie
","Its full of holes,its unrelated to anything logical but its a movie made with the intention of Entertaining People. Happily it wasn't full of technical jargon which could give my brain a hernia.It just got on with the main business-how many people could be killed I watched it on DVD and its now 10 years after.I couldn't help but think of how Blair and Bush would have coped with all this! Now that we have computer games on DVD it looks just like that-a computer game. You could ask a million questions about the plot-like when one of the aliens speaks its in English! The explosions are great-but with major cities being zapped out all over the globe the reality is it would have caused massive Earthquakes and floods to say nothing of a communication breakdown.In other words no single computer would have worked. But logic wasn't the name of the game here. Entertainment WAS and I enjoyed it-in fact I'll watch it again",10,1,2,17 February 2007
28 Days Later...," More than the usual splatterfest
","Here encapsulated in this movie are many strands from either horror literature (Day of the Triffids where a man wakes up in a hospital and finds no one on the streets and a load of crashed cars and buses),historical events (the Great Plague especially),more recent events (Aids) and one of the blights of modern society (road and other rages).And more disturbingly the laboratories who meddle with Nature) In the first 28 days there's non stop killing,panicking,screaming. If you can get past the fact that people are heard screaming as they fall from great heights (impossible because of oxygen displacement)or all the computers in full working order (who are the ISP staff?) to say nothing of the electricity supply which would have shut down with no one to maintain it) its a damn good film -and some of it was shot near Blackpool where I live!",10,0,1,29 May 2008
Across the Universe," For those who like Beatles covers
",What seems like a movie inspired by the Stigwood one Sgt.Pepper is this time round not given such a trashing. Loses 2 stars because of the horrible performance by Eddie Izzard who I believe is some sort of 'alternative comedian' but any comedy in Mr Kite was done by John Lennon and doesn't need an unfunny comic to add to it. Perhaps now in the U K we'll get the Sgt Pepper movie as enough time has passed for a new generation to appreciate what to my mine was a great film. Otherwise this is a movie which only works because of its music. It doesn't have a powerful story line like I Am Sam but what it does have is what could be a series of music videos. For the collector of Beatles covers this is manna from Heaven. One thing puzzles me though-why has some person with the hideous name of Dana Fuchs not changed it?,8,0,0,25 April 2008
Saw II," Too deep for me
",Unfortunately I fell for the blurb on the sleeve which said this was a horror film. What it is is as much of a convoluted plot as a James Bond film-its like Star Wars or something with all the technology. For a start the actual excuse for a story is too implausible to try and make any sense of-it just seems to be a display of special effects at some stages-you are expected to believe that some guy is controlling all this stuff from behind a screen and it includes a fire breaking out as well as the usual time locks copout! After watching the first Saw I read a synopsis of it on Wikipedia and the story summed up in about 10 minutes worth of reading made me wonder why anyone bothers. You should be able to tell the average person just what a movie is about but with SAW that's impossible you'd never even remember half of it,3,0,2,12 March 2007
Ray," Impeccably researched biopic
",Ray Charles was an unknown quantity in the UK till he made Swanee River about 1957-he also made My Bonnie both of which were made by Tony Sheridan & the Beatles in Germany-but it wasn't till 1959 that he crossed over to the U S pop charts with What'd I say-a song which has been made by over 200 artists since.I think the first UK hits began around the time he signed with ABC Paramount but his legend is such that it probably seems unbelievable nowadays that all those songs made famous in cover versions by Elvis or Eddie Cochran or Bobby Darin never did anything for him in this country. Not only did Ray Charles create a market for rhythm'n'blues but also for country music by 1962. Pity the film never touched on those great Beatles songs he covered one of which was Yesterday. And when McCartney wrote this song he had no idea what the melody was in his mind when he woke up. But listen to Georgia on my mind-its not a million miles away from the song and very likely that McCartney had dreamt of this song. There's many great moments-the way the records began selling slowly at first then hitting the pop charts in 1959 after which came 3 No.I singles. Hit the road Jack even had an answer version by a group of black girls who sounded like the Raelets (the Chantels) and the former name of the Raelets -the Cookies-was resurrected in the 60s by a different group Possibly the oddest song Charles ever recorded was a version of I can see clearly now-he had a sense of humour!,10,0,1,22 February 2007
Signs," An insult to the intelligence of a Retard
",Imagine you wake up in the morning and try to recall what you were dreaming-nothing names any logical sense when you dream of your wife and she turns out to be your mother-that kind of thing. Thats what this heap of codswallop is-I mean who puts up the money for a film which is not even supposed to be a drama of sorts yet doesn't even make it as a comedy or a human story on the lines of ET Its full of goofs and the only thing is got right was to be BORING! Goofs-take your pick between: a one time Reverend who's called 'Father' by people who knew him when I think most people know its Catholic priests who are thus styled and are not allowed to take a wife. Or the crop circles supposedly seen from a window yet are a long way down the field of tall plants. The aliens looked exactly like the Roswell alien-have these people no imagination. The unreality of the whole thing is rather stupid when the Government seems unconcerned. It comes to no conclusion either-its just a very dumb story and to give it 1 is just for the scenery,1,4,7,1 March 2007
