Alien 3," My favourite of the four
","Maybe it's because this was the first 'Alien' movie I saw, and I saw in the cinema, but it's my favourite of the series. The music, the action, the direction and the acting are terrific. Ripley is tougher and she's more interesting as well. Her character really develops in this one.After this one, Alien is second best. I like Aliens least, contrary to popular opinion. Alien Resurrection is also terrific.",Null,0,2,14 March 2003
Billy Elliot," Not Just About Ballet
","I learn ballet, and my whole ballet class went together to watch the movie, knowing it was about dancing. But we soon found out that that's not all it's about. Jamie Bell deserves all praise for his intense performance. Gary Lewis and Julie Walters were excellent as well. In fact, the whole cast was excellent - it was flawless acting from all. The Soundtrack is also worth mentioning.",8,0,0,5 July 2001
The Fifth Element," Great Special Effects
","This Movie has great action, comedy, and special effects. Bruce Willis has done a good job and looks absolutely Gorgeous in this Movie. So does Milla Jovavich. I thought Chris Tucker was hilarious. My friend and I couldn't stop laughing everytime he said zzzzz! It's a Movie worth watching, although I feel that it would view better in the theatre.",8,0,1,8 May 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton does it again!..
","Though not his best movie ( I liked Edward Scissorhands the best), the Direction is excellent. Though I was not scared out of my wits, the atmosphere was eerie. Christopher Walken was very good, and Johnny Depp was adequete. My favorite scenes were right at the beginning of the film and the scene which explains the story of the Headless Horseman. Worth watching...",Null,0,0,31 May 2000
The Beach," Read the book first!!
","The movie does not even come close to the book. My advise to anyone who hasn't seen it is - go and read the book first so it doesn't ruin the story for you. The only saving graces(s) of the film are Danny Boyle's direction, the beautiful cinematography and the Soundtrack. The acting is mediocre.",Null,0,0,23 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Best
","I saw this movie as a kid, when my mother took my sister and me to the theatre to watch it. When I saw it again after it's re-release a few years back, it was as good as I remembered it to be. The action, adventure, characters, plot, music and atmosphere makes it the best of all the Star Wars movies.",Null,0,0,22 June 2001
Notting Hill," A very sweet movie
","While I wouldn't go so far as to say 'brilliant', this movie is quite good. It's a sweet, romantic and funny movie and the actors do a good job. I like the fact that it's in a quaint place like Notting Hill. Worth seeing..",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
LÃ©on: The Professional," A brilliant Movie
","This Movie is one of the best Movies I've seen. It is violent and frightening and sensitive at the same time. The acting by Gary Oldman, Natalie Portman and Jean Reno is absolutely brilliant. Luc Besson has directed this Movie the way it should be. Go see it!",7,1,5,8 May 1999
American Beauty," Much better the second time!
","Anyone who didn't enjoy the movie, I recommend you see it once more. It's definitely better. In fact I think the direction is brilliant and Kevin Spacey is excellent. I also think that Annette Benning's performance is wonderful! I think she definitely deserved the Oscar nomination, if not the Award itself!! Some scenes are a bit on the 'Pseudo' side, but all in all, a good film.",10,0,0,31 May 2000
Edward Scissorhands," One of the most touching Movies
","I don't know exactly what it is about this Movie that appeals to me. It could be the touching story, or the wonderful sets, or the great acting by Dianne Wiest, Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, and Alan Arkin. I guess it's all of them!",9,0,0,8 May 1999
Dirty Dancing," Amazing Dancing!
","This is a great movie! I watched it first a long time ago and I can still watch it again and again without getting bored. The Dance sequences are very good especially the first one where they are 'showing off'. The soundtrack is very good. In fact when this movie came on Cable for the first time in my City, there wasn't a single person in the whole of Bombay who didn't watch it that night! At least, not that I know of! Worth watching - it's a lot of fun!",8,1,1,12 February 2000
The Game," Entertaining
",This Movie has an interesting and different plot. It is well directed and has a fantastic end. It is nice to see such a different concept once in a while. I would give it 7/10. The atmosphere created by the Director is perfect.,7,0,1,29 April 1999
Meet Joe Black," A wonderful Film!
","One of the most touching movies I have ever seen! The acting is excellent except for the Lead Actress. The script is very good. I especially liked the part where Anthony Hopkins and his eldest daughter speak about their relationship. Very, very touching!!",8,0,0,8 May 2000
Dumb and Dumber," Hilarious!
",This movie gets better and better the more you see it. The two main actors have wonderful chemistry and comic timing. Who would have thought that Jeff Daniels would be such an amazing comedian! Each scene is guaranteed to make you laugh.,Null,0,0,13 August 2001
Jerry Maguire," Gets better everytime you watch it!
","The first time I saw this movie, I was unimpressed, I felt it didn't live up to the hype. When I saw it again, I loved it! I don't know much about American football, and I don't like Tom Cruise, but I really think he deserved the Oscar for his performance in this movie! I just love the part in the hotel room, when he picks up the phone and sniffs. Great film, worth watching over and over again!",Null,1,4,27 October 2001
The Mummy Returns," Popcorn Movie
",The Mummy Returns is a good movie if you don't take it too seriously. And it's better to watch it after seeing the first one. The special effects were definitely better in this movie. Brendan Fraser hardly had a role though - seemed a bit henpecked. The son was good and so was John Hannah's character. Fight sequences were excellent - especially in the Egyptian sequences. The Anubis warriors were good too. Entertaining.,Null,0,0,9 July 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Excellent Production Design
","Though the sets look a little dated in this movie, the Production Design is excellent even for this day and age. It's an excellent movie, that combines comedy and horrible violence so masterfully! The beginning of the movie, and the hour that comes after is absolutely fantastic. It gets even better when you see it again. Stanley Kubrick did a fantastic job on this film. Check out the parts when he revisits 'Home', and also in the beginning on the waterfront when Alex drives his point home. Worth seeing!!",9,0,0,19 December 2000
Pulp Fiction," The Hype was justified
","This is one of a few films where I was not disappointed even after seeing the trailer hundreds of times. The plot is excellent and the acting too, with the exception of Quentin T. I agree that he should stick to his superb direction. The most hilarious part is when they they are in the car and go over the 'bump'. Great Script.",8,0,0,9 May 1999
Ice Age," Short and sweet!
","I must confess, the trailer for this movie could have been better - but I'm glad I watched it (at the behest of a friend). The script, animation and story were all excellent and the voices of the characters matched perfectly! I enjoyed it more than the last few big animated movies like Shrek and Monsters Inc. A great movie! Watch out for the squirrel - the funniest animated animal ever!",Null,0,0,5 June 2002
Raging Bull," A bit over-rated!
","I agree with some other people who've reviewed this movie that it's a bit over-rated. There's no doubt that the direction and acting is excellent, but I wasn't impressed by the story. The end dragged a bit. I can't help but make a few comparisons with 'Goodfellas' because it had the same Director and actors. I feel it was a better movie. The boxing sequences were very well done. I would give this movie a 6 1/2 on 10.",Null,1,5,1 March 2000
The Matrix," A very good movie
","The Matrix is a very good movie mainly because of the powerful storyline and the special effects. The direction is 'simple' and straight-forward; and the Director relies on the atmosphere, sets and dialogue as well as the special effects to tell the story; rather than the Camera angles and technique. The acting is very good from all three stars. Definitely a movie worth watching many times!",Null,0,0,12 February 2000
Gladiator," Good acting
","The acting in this movie redeems the plot. Joaquim Phoenix is one of the most underrated actors, I feel. He's excellent in the movie especially in the scene with Richard Harris. Russell Crowe is adequete in his role and Richard Harris is good. Good costumes, but did Romans wear Indian Bindis at that time? Hmmm. The sets were good as well and this movie has definitely made me want to see go to Rome to admire the Architecture! The best scene is in the beginning, the Battle in Germania.Excellent direction.",Null,0,0,10 September 2000
Goodfellas," Good Film
","This Movie is one of my favorites. I'm not a big fan of Movies about killing and of violence, but this Movie definitely has something special in it. The acting is excellent- specially Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert de Niro. The script is also very good. I would give this Movie 8 1/2 on 10.",8,1,4,2 May 1999
