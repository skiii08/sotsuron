The Blair Witch Project," A Chillingly Realistic Found Footage Movie
","What Blair Witch Project does so well, is create an unsettling, uncomfortable tone that lingers throughout the movie. There is a constant feeling of unease that takes place as soon as the three lead characters enter the woods.The film does a great job of making a tale about witchcraft feel so realistic. This is primarily due to the incredibly believable performances of the cast, especially the main three, who we spent much of the runtime with. They always feel like real people, and their frustrations and fights with one another never feel forced but feel as if the oppressive atmosphere of the woods is influencing their actions.The movie has an incredibly effective setup, with locals from the town telling stories of the Blair Witch legend. The fact that these stories feel like they're being told from the perspective of real people gives them a chilling quality.The low quality, found-footage documentary style also adds to the grounded tone. It does not feel like a conventional movie due to the lack of a narrative structure or musical score. The occasional use of a 16mm black and white cameras is very effective in adding a chilling quality to the film, especially the daytime scenes in the woods.The use of sounds in this film is incredible. A lot of this movie takes place at night with a blank black screen, where we can hear only distant noises. By not showing us anything, it allows the audience to imagine what is out there in the woods, which makes it even scarier. This also applies to the Blair Witch, who we never see throughout the movie at all. Our imagination is more terrifying than anything that could have been put on screen. Despite not appearing, her presence is felt throughout.The final ten minutes of this movie is genuinely terrifying, with simple images such as children's handprints on the walls of the abandoned house in the woods, sticking with the viewer long after the film ends. And while it does end very abruptly, the final shot is very unsettling and gets under your skin.While the sense of realism created by the filmmakers works so effectively throughout the movie, it also has its negatives. By creating such realistic and believable central characters, they become unremarkable and uninteresting with minimal characterisation. This is only a minor flaw, however in an otherwise excellent horror movie.",7,2,4,24 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Disappointing Prequel That Can't Deliver the Thrills of the Original Trilogy
","One of the main reasons that The Phantom Menace feels so disappointing is the fact that it had so much potential to be great. The movie tries to do something different and not merely be a rehash of the original. While it is still a space adventure, it is set in a different era, with an all-new set of characters, except for one or two familiar faces.The film attempts to introduce the audience to several visually stunning new worlds, like Naboo, Coruscant and the Gungan Underwater City. While these new worlds are fresh and original, the overuse of CGI to bring these environments to life makes it very hard to buy into the believability of them as real places.Not only are the worlds difficult to believe in, but some characters also, most notably Jar Jar Binks. He is an extremely irritating individual, which is an issue given his large amount of screen time. Having a fully CGI character in 1999 was a poor decision that hasn't aged well at all. It is impossible to invest in the character in the same way you can with a practical character like Chewbacca, from the original trilogy. Jar Jar is only one of many CGI characters who take you out of the movie every time they appear on the screen. Even Yoda from the original trilogy is a digital creation in the film, replacing the practical puppet from the previous instalments.The film, in general, has dated CGI from start to finish, with the final battle involving the Gungan army looking like scenes from an early 2000's video game. While poor special effects usually are something I can overlook, they were so prominent throughout the entire movie that it was a constant distractionThe acting in the film was pretty average, with several wooden performances. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jin was the most likeable character in the movie although this is faint praise as the rest of the cast were very forgettable. Ewan McGregor was poor as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He seemed to be doing an Alec Guinness impersonation throughout the movie, instead of making the character his own.What makes the movie worth watching, however, is a couple of outstanding action sequences. The pod race sequence has aged much better than most sections of the film. It is still thrilling to this day and features some genuinely incredible sound design. The final lightsaber battle between Darth Maul, Qui Gon Jin and Obi-Wan is fantastic, and it may be the best lightsabre fight in the series. John Williams theme 'Duel of the Fates' which plays throughout the sequence is epic and is some of his best work. This movie also features Darth Maul, who instantly became an iconic Star Wars villain, and is the most memorable character in the film. Unfortunately, he doesn't get much to do besides looking cool with his amazing double-sided lightsabre.",4,1,2,22 October 2019
The Terminator," Schwarzenegger Shines in James Cameron's Breakout Film
","What makes The Terminator work so well is the simplicity of its story, which is told so effectively. It has a straightforward and engaging narrative that is easy to follow for the audience. Given the fact that this is a science fiction story that deals with time travel, credit must be given to the well-written script from James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd.The main cast in this movie does a great job and bring their characters to life. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a terrific performance as the titular character, creating one of cinemas most iconic villains. His complete lack of reasoning or empathy makes him terrifying. Michael Biehn is very likeable in the role of Kyle Reese and gives it his all, while Linda Hamilton is solid in the role of Sarah Connor. Paul Winfield and Lance Hendrickson are also memorable in their small parts as a lieutenant and detective, respectively.The movie includes some fantastic action sequences, including a shootout in a police station and most notably, a sequence which takes place in the Tech Noir nightclub, where the tension soars to fantastic heights. The action throughout the movie is gripping and violent with Brad Feidal's iconic score taking them to the next level. Feidal's music is epic and emotional when it needs to be while also evoking a sense of dread whenever the T-800 is on screen.Despite its low budget, the film does a good job with the special effects, in particular, the few scenes that are set in the future. The T-800's prosthetic arm and the cyborg skeleton design are also magnificent. Some effects haven't dated as well as others, however. An animatronic head is used in a small number of scenes after the T-800 injures his eye, which never looks convincing and takes the viewer out of the movie.The final action sequence in the factory doesn't have the same edge of your seat excitement as the rest of the film. This is down to the use of stop motion effects which feel jarring compared to the gritty, realistic style of the rest of the movie.The weakest element of the film is the love story between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. It never feels convincing or believable, given that the characters have only known each other for a single day. The sex scene between the two characters is also incredibly awkward, with the camerawork and editing making it feel like an 80's music video.Overall, The Terminator is a great, fast-paced action movie. It put James Cameron on the map and gave Arnie his career-defining role. While it isn't perfect, it's essential viewing for fans of science fiction cinema.",7,1,3,14 October 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," An Enjoyable Yet Underwhelming Animation
","While Tintin is a fun, exciting film, I had expected more given the creative team involved in this movie, including Steven Spielberg as director, Edgar Wright as co-writer and Peter Jackson as a producer.The movie begins with a fantastic title sequence magnificently scored by John Williams, which sets the tone for the film to come. Although I had not read the source material by Herg√©, I was certainly aware of them and appreciated the wonderful nod to the original, iconic, two-dimensional artistry of the comic book which took place during Tintin's introduction scene. From here, the movie quickly distinguishes itself from what came before, with the motion capture animation feeling fresh and inventive.The motion capture technology works very well here. All human characters are easily able to display genuine emotion on their computer-generated faces, never feeling lifeless or distracting. While the human characters are beautifully realised and have a realistic look to them, the animals feel closer to standard cartoon animation. Moments featuring a cat and a herd of cows stood out from the rest of the films visual look. Even Snowy did not seem to be rendered as well as Tintin or his human counterparts, although his presence is never distracting.The cast does a great job with Jamie Bell doing a great job of bringing the titular character to life. And while it was nowhere near their best collaborations, it is always great to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on screen together. It was also fun to watch Daniel Craig give an enjoyably villainous performance. Andy Serkis, as Captain Haddock, was the heart of the film, however, getting the only real character arc in the film.While the movie was entertaining and engaging throughout, the ending was slightly anticlimactic. It ends abruptly on a cliff-hanger, without any real resolution. This is particularly frustrating since we are still waiting on a sequel almost ten years after its release.",6,1,1,10 May 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A Sci-Fi Action Masterpiece
","T2 is a movie that builds and improves upon the original in every way. Right from the opening pre-credit sequence, the special effects are enhanced, and the action is more intense.The movie tricks the audience into believing that this movie will be a carbon copy of the 1984 classic. The setup is almost identical, with Arnie's famous T-800 and Robert Patrick's mysterious new character travelling back in time, this time with Sarah Connor's son, John, as the target. The movie then reveals its amazingly executed twist; the T-800 is the good guy, reprogrammed by an older John Connor to protect his younger self from Robert Patrick's T-1000.The T-1000 is a worthy successor to Arnie's original villain. He is a more advanced cyborg, made from liquid metal, who can change shape and take the form of other humans. Given the fact that the movie is almost 30 years old, the effects hold up surprisingly well.The movie does an outstanding job of developing the three main protagonists in exciting and unexpected ways. Linda Hamilton is given a lot more to do in this sequel and provides an excellent performance as Sarah Connor. She is a much different character this time around, and we see the effects of the trauma inflicted on her from the original. Over the course of the movie, we see her lose her humanity and almost become a 'terminator' herself.We are introduced to John Connor is this movie. From the original, we know that he grows up to be this great military leader. Given this, it is surprising to find him as a troubled teen, getting moved from one foster home to another. Actor Edward Furlong brings a lot of energy to the screen and gives a good performance.The movie also finds a way to make Arnold Schwarzenegger's cyborg one of the most human characters in the film. While Sarah is losing her humanity, Arnold is finding his, learning from John, with whom he has great chemistry. Arnie also brings a lot of humour to this version of the T-800, which works brilliantly. His termination at the movie's climax is a genuinely emotional moment.The action throughout the movie is phenomenal, with one action sequence after another delivering edge of your seat thrills. These include the motorcycle chase, the hospital breakout, the lab break-in, the highway chase and the climax in the factory. Each of these sequences is original and inventive, and it's tough to choose a single piece of action that could be removed from the film. The makeup and prosthetics used on Arnie's damaged face are also great.At over two and a half hours, the movie is brilliantly paced and never drags. When it slows down after the hospital breakout, we get some crucial character moments between John and Sarah, followed by John and the T-800.If I had to find a criticism with the movie, it would be Sarah Connor's voiceover. It feels like a last-minute inclusion and a little unnecessary. Fortunately, it is used very sporadically and doesn't detract from the quality of the film.For me, Terminator 2 is where the franchise ends. It is an all-round satisfying, emotional and hopeful movie. It is funnier, more profound and better than its predecessor in every way. Overall, it is a sci-fi action masterpiece.Note: This review is for the Directors Cut",9,2,2,17 October 2019
Dunkirk," A Fresh and Inventive World War II Film
","What director, Christopher Nolan, manages to do with Dunkirk is make a straightforward war movie feel fresh and original, by creating an unusual narrative structure. The film tells three intersecting stories. The stories are told from land, sea and air, taking place over a week, a day and an hour, respectively. This storytelling technique may seem unnecessarily complicated on paper, yet it works tremendously well on the screen.The film does an incredible job of creating a realistic depiction of war, without the use of any blood or gore. This is done not only with the fantastic practical effects but also by the young actors in the film, who feel like they could be 18 or 19 years old, as opposed to 30-year-old actors who typically play teenagers in war movies. There is almost no backstories or character development for these soldiers, as one would expect from a film of this calibre. Instead, we are in the moment with these young men and do not have time to stop and talk about their lives before the war.Hans Zimmer produces a masterful score once again. Like with his previous collaboration with Nolan for Interstellar, Zimmer incorporates a ticking clock into the music which builds tension and intensifies the action. It is, without a doubt, one of his finest scores.The movie is very much a visual experience. There are no backstories for the characters and very little dialogue throughout the runtime. It is over 30 minutes before the film's 'lead', Fionn Whitehead has his first line. The story is told primarily through images, which makes it feel refreshing.The practical effects are phenomenal throughout the movie, whether it's the fantastic aerial battle or the action scenes that take place in the middle of the ocean. At no point do you question if any of the effects are CGI or if they were shot on a soundstage. The aerial battles, in particular, are jaw-dropping. Nolan, along with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema film these sequences with IMAX cameras, which only increase the scale and make the action even more epic than it already is.The editing of this movie is outstanding. The way in which it intercuts between the different stories, supported by Zimmer's music, is simply breath-taking.The movie also borders on horror at some points, due to the intensity of the action. One scene in particular, where a German bomber is approaching the beach with thousands of soldiers running for their lives, is truly terrifying.The movie isn't perfect, however. While the lack of backstory and
characterisation works, for the most part, you don't have the same emotional involvement as you would in other great war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, for example. And although this film has minimal dialogue and exposition, one scene involving Kenneth Branagh explaining the situation felt a little forced. Finally, while the sequences shot in IMAX are stunning, the changing aspect ratios can be a little distracting at times.Overall, however, this movie is an amazing cinematic experience, unlike anything I've seen in the cinema before. From a technical point of view, this film is a masterpiece. It deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible.",8,0,3,30 October 2019
Unknown," An Enjoyable Yet Unremarkable Thriller
","Unknown is a stylish, atmospheric film, yet it is not particularly memorable. It has a pretty effective opening, setting up an intriguing mystery for which the plot of this movie is based around.The film boasts a fantastic cast including supporting roles for veterans Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz. Both actors are the best aspects of the movie and would have been nice to have seen more from them. Liam Neeson is a very entertaining screen presence as usual. He is a reliable lead and is enjoyable to watch. January Jones has the look of a classic Hitchcockian blonde, but unfortunately, she has very little to do.While the movie is filled with these great actors, the characters they play are pretty standard. They lacked any real depth, as did the film itself. While Neeson and co-star Diane Kruger are never unlikeable, there is an emotional distance between their characters and the audience.The tone of this movie is sombre, yet the plot is quite silly. It also features some over the top action, which didn't fit with this tone, including scenes in which Kruger's taxi driver fights against professionally trained bodyguards.Overall, this is a solid thriller. It is well made and features an interesting central mystery. Unfortunately, it is unremarkable and not very rewatchable.",5,2,2,31 October 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," No Amount of Spectacle Can Save This Excruciatingly Dull Sequel
","Michael Bay has always been known as a filmmaker who puts style over substance. While it worked to a certain extent with the first entry in the Transformers franchise, which was an enjoyable summer blockbuster, this follow-up doesn't add anything remotely new to the series.At 2 hours and 30 minutes, the movie is far too long. The extended action scenes stretch the thin plot out much longer than it has any right to be. The final battle in Egypt lasts approximately 45 minutes, and long before it reaches its climax, I had become numb to the explosions and destruction. Given that there is no time spent worrying about the thousands of civilian casualties incurred over the film's runtime, the action throughout feels weightless and dull.Almost every character in the movie is hugely unlikeable. Both Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox's characters return, and they have become even less interesting than the previous film. They are unsympathetic leads who lack any chemistry. The movie briefly attempts to involve these characters in an awful love triangle, but it is quickly dropped, having next to no impact on their relationship.Unfortunately, they are not helped by the supporting cast, with a majority of them also being extremely annoying, including Sam's parents, his college roommate, Leo, and new robot characters Mudflap and Skids. John Turturro attempts to add some energy when he appears, but unfortunately, he cannot do much with the awful script. Each of these side characters seems to be in the movie with the sole purpose of being comedic relief, but unfortunately, the humour falls flat consistently.The whole movie left me feeling cold and empty. The 'deaths' of both Sam and Optimus Prime did not feel remotely impactful or sad simply because you don't care enough about any of the characters. Given that these are two primary characters in the franchise, these should be huge, shocking moments, but unfortunately, they are forgettable.The only redeeming factor of this movie is the spectacle. The special effects and production are superb and still hold up a decade after the film was released. The overall one-note villains were given as a small bit of versatility with the addition of new characters Ravage and Devastator, whose cool visual design distinguished one CGI robot from the other.",2,1,2,10 May 2020
Moon," An Impressive Debut for Director Duncan Jones
","One of the most notable aspects of Moon is the sense of isolation it conveys right from the opening scene. By doing this, it helps the audience to understand the actions of the main character, Sam Bell.Sam Rockwell plays Bell in this film, and he is nothing short of magnificent. For almost the entire movie he is the only actor seen on screen. He does a fantastic job of playing two very different versions of the same character. He is unhinged and crazy at times yet always believable and relatable.The film features another great score from the underrated composer, Clint Mansell. The music reinforces the feeling of isolation for our lonely central character.Kevin Spacey voices the computer, GERTY, in the film. I was pleasantly surprised to find that GERTY was not merely a HAL 9000 rip-off, as I expected at the beginning of the movie. Its actions were surprising and satisfying.While the interior sets are terrific, feeling realistic and lived in, it is easy to tell from the exterior scenes on the moon that the film was shot on a low budget. It has a slight artificiality to it, although it can be overlooked.The film loses some momentum in the second half, as the twist is revealed a little too early in the runtime. However, the narrative is still engaging until the end due to Rockwell's heart-breaking performance.Overall, it is an excellent debut from Duncan Jones, son of music legend David Bowie. It features a wonderful dual performance from Sam Rockwell along with an excellent musical score.",7,0,0,30 October 2019
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Another Tedious Entry in the Hugely Successful Franchise
","Michael Bay's third entry in the Transformers franchise gets off to a promising start, with an exciting, history rewriting pre-credit sequence which involves the Apollo 11 Moon Landings. Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill. While Bay seems to have attempted to take on board some of the criticisms of the previous instalment, Revenge of the Fallen, many of the same problems are present here.Sam's parents have much less screen time here, and problematic robots Mudflap and Skids are absent. Despite this, the movie introduces several new irritating characters played by John Malkovich, Ken Jeong and Alan Tudyk, while Mudflap and Skids have been replaced by a drunken Irish robot and an angry Scottish robot.Megan Fox does not return for this instalment and is replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is fine but unremarkable in the role. Her chemistry with Shia LaBeouf is marginally better than Fox, and her character is slightly more likeable. Frances McDormand also joins the cast and is the best aspect of the movie. She at least makes her scenes somewhat interesting and watchable.The main issues with this movie are almost identical to its predecessor. The movie is filled with dull, unlikeable character that you have no investment in, even after three lengthy films. While Shia LaBeouf gives a better performance here than in previous films, his character isn't interesting enough to lead this franchise.The same crass, awful humour is present here, although it is mainly absent in the final hour, in which it is nonstop action. While the action here is more coherent than in Revenge of the Fallen, it can't hold the audience's attention due to its overload of CGI and explosions and its characters with who you have no emotional connection. The fact that the primary objective for a majority of the action sequence is to rescue Sam's girlfriend while the fate of the entire human race is at stake felt ridiculous. The film then ends very abruptly without any real resolution for the characters.As expected, the visual effects are great. The addition of a robot that seemed to be inspired by Mad Max was a nice touch along with a vulture-like robot. Unfortunately, they are given no characterisation.Overall, I found this movie to be another disappointment. While it does improve ever so slightly over Revenge of the Fallen, it is never engaging, emotional, funny or exciting, beyond the well-executed opening sequence.",3,2,5,17 October 2019
