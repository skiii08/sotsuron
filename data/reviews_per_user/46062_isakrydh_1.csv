Hereditary," Modern horror done right
",The movie is suspenseful and builds on the relationship between the family members. It's really a slow burn but the third act does not disappoint. The movie is very dark and mysterious which leads to very interesting discussions and theories. It's hard to find cons in this movie but you can compare it to the babadook or maybe the exorcist. It's a thrilling 127 minutes and it deserves in my opinion 10/10,10,2,5,4 November 2018
