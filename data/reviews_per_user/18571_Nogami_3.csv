Alien 3," Ruins everything good about the first two films
",I'm not going to justify this piece of filth by writing a long review. Alien 3 ruined all of the characters and atmosphere created by the first two movies.I remember walking out of the theatre wanting my money back.,1,199,212,8 June 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," The best movie you'll never want to see again
","I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago.  It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions.  At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.  It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to 'decompress' after watching it.  To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie.",10,823,856,26 August 2001
Mission: Impossible II," MI2 - John Woo, Thandie Newton, Tom Cruise pull it off!
","Without a doubt, John Woo saved this movie from being another 'Tom Cruise' scenery chewing vehicle like the first MI.For the record, I couldn't stand the first Mission Impossible movie.  As a longtime fan of the original series, it was extremely disappointing in that it had no 'style' - simply a hacked-together mess of action sequences.With the new movie, you have to understand and acknowledge that Woo has a trademark action style that you either love, or hate.  I think it worked very well in MI2.I'll say right out that I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, however he WAS good in this movie - this is the movie that the last Bond movie should've been.Who could end a MI-2 review without a note about the remarkable Thandie Newton, who I havn't seen before this feature.  This girl is talented! Besides being absolutely, stunningly beautiful, she IS a very talented actress who I'm sure is now well on her way to super-stardom.  (I love her British accent as well - certainly adds an elegant, playful style to her character)!",8,3,6,25 May 2000
