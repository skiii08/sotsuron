The Expendables 2," I am crossed
","When I saw the expendables the first time I loved it! But when I saw part II I was disappointed I am not sure is it the director or what? I find part II silly, I mean the first part was serious but part II was as if a clown directed it! I mean I knew the meaning of the word expendable but part I lost the meaning! Dolph Lundgren or the character Gunter was a little too blond and he played the role of a loser in my opinion plus he was a former ???? I think there is no relation?? plus the introduction I find it original I think a true genius made it it is truly original but it was a blood bath a little over the edge. Well I originally do not watch likewise films but the other night they displayed it on TV so I thought why not? but it turned out to be a real blood bath but it then turned to be a comedy silliness and I started asking myself ids this the same expendables I saw 2007 on the only 24 hour film channel we had at that time?.",8,1,1,28 January 2013
