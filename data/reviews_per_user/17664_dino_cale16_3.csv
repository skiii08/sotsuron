Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Comic Genius
","This started Space Jam, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Movie, Osmosis Jones and more movies that mix animation with live action actors. I loved the usage of the wacky looney tunes in the more innocent setting of the Mickey Mouse cartoons. From tweetie's cameo, to Roger's hero Goofy, to Porky Pigs's camoes, to these godfather like weasels, to Tinkerbell. Out of toon town they used elements from Italian-American hit movies. I loved Christopher Llyod as well as the role of Jessica's Performance Model. She is the most sexiest cartoon ever. Above all this is comic genius having a movie for adults using kid themes. It is a really good film.",Null,1,1,10 November 2007
Madagascar," The Greatest and Worst Animamted Movie!!!
","Madagascar! Where do I begin. I like and dislike this movie for so many reasons I like it because it is plum out HILARIOUS. The part on the subway with the lion and the baseball fan is good, the part of the Marty the zebra in time square, getting cornered by police and news reporters, the psycotic penguins, and the chimps, and even the part on the boat going to Kenya, but got shipwrecked. I used to want to be an animal conservationalist as a younger kid and this mixed that with my love for comedy. I love a good animal personification (every now and then.) I dislike the movie cause the only real funny parts with the exception of some dialouge by King Julian the ring tailed lemur and one where Alex chases Marty the only funny parts took place when the animals were in New York or on the boat. When they came to Madagascar it lacked funny parts, but had some cute laughless jokes. The movie should have been called New York City Zoo. I mean the parts in the New York scenes were hilarious or on a 10 on a scale 1-10 and the funny parts in Madagascar were a 3.5 PS-I;ve been to every location (New York City, Kenya, and Madagascar) the movie covered except Antarctica.",Null,0,2,29 October 2007
Forrest Gump," Forrest, Forrest Gump
","Forrest Gump is well, probably the best movie made by Hollywood. It captures the aspects of everyday American life but of that of man who has experienced war, met the president three times, met Elvis, John Lennon, visited DC, was America's first ping pong champion, an American philosophical slogan giver, and even a fit runner who ran across the country. He is the All-American guy. It made you feel you were there in 60s when we landed on the moon, when Richard Nixon robbed the Watergate, and when African-American were making the mark on America. However despite it's emotional and innocent events it had some moments like whe Jenny (god bless her soul even though she had done wrong) was a prostitute, when JFK, George Wallace, Lennon, and more were shot, and even when Forrest's mom had to sleep with a school principal so Forrest could make it in life brang out the dark and dirty points of our nation and leaves feeling a little guilty for how society is. This is why I only give 'Forrest Gump' a 9. I still like when he says 'Big Bubblegum Shrimp'",9,4,7,5 October 2007
