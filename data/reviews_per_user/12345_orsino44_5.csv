National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Disappointing sequel still better than 90% of what's at the movies
","NT2 contains some of what made NT1 so much fun, but is missing some key elements.**BEYOND THIS THERE BE SPOILERS**First, I got plot questions: Why doesn't Booth know how to decode his own coded letter when he even has the key? Why is the KGC subplot dropped from the film after the first half hour? Why doesn't Ben Gates have any cred with the powers that be after finding the world's biggest treasure in the first movie? He still has to sneak around and break into everything. (answer - so Riley can be a character in the movie) Why does his ex-girlfriend have the huge mansion? She didn't buy it, and they weren't married. And after all the jumping through hoops, why is Thomas Gates listed in Booth's diary as 'mastermind?' If they explained, I missed it, and that explanation was what the whole thing was supposedly about. I guess these are minor.What I really miss from part one is the appreciation of history. The most interesting characters in the film (Lincoln, Booth, Albert Pike, Queen Victoria) are little more than passing thoughts here. Nothing as grand as those opening montages in NT1, showing the origin of the treasure, the legend, the only surviving clue, etc. There is a scene of the Lincoln assassination, and it's one of the best things in the film. For two minutes. There is also a very good car chase and a good deathtrap before the final discovery which was borrowed from the Republic serial Manhunt in the African Jungle, IIRC. The performances are uniformly good, except maybe for Diane Kruger, whose German accent is much more noticeable than in the first installment. (I know, she looks good, so that cancels it out.)Speaking of looking good, Cage's hair stylist has failed him royally on this one and should never be hired by him again. It's only three years since the last installment and he looks like 10 years before the mast/5 miles of bad road. Bad cut, bad color. He is a major movie star, people, can you help the man out for heaven's sake?Still, the movie is fun and funny, fast paced and clean, and worth the price of admission if you're looking for some escapist fun.",6,1,2,22 December 2007
Vertigo," Superlative piece of cinema
","When I first saw Vertigo, I was too young to appreciate it. Years later, I gave it another look and was totally blown away. I love Hitchcock, he hardly ever fumbled in his entire career, and this is among his very, very best (along with Shadow of a Doubt).Never mind what some have said about Stewart looking too old -- his age is one of the main things that makes this movie work. If Scotty hasn't been around the track a few times, where is the tragedy of his complete and total fall into obsession with a young, beautiful and unattainable woman? In addition to which, JS does some of his greatest acting here. The final climb into the tower is a tour de force, an absolute masterpiece of film acting that has to be seen multiple times to be fully comprehended.Another thing about Vertigo that makes it remarkable for me among Hitch's films: he didn't have some of his usual collaborators here. Vera Miles was pregnant, so her role went to Kim Novak. Barbara Bel Geddes is another unusual (and terrific) choice. Not seeing so many faces I associate with other great Hitchcock films somehow gives Vertigo a special life of its own. Beautifully written, shot, cut and acted and what a phenomenal ending. When there was nothing more to say, Hitch, to his credit, said nothing. (The supplemental ending is garbage.) Take a look at Vertigo; it's amazing.",10,7,10,11 December 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," We'll always have Tanis
","Superlatives fail. What to say? Paragon? Pinnacle? Zenith? I surrender. This review isn't meant to convince anyone that Raiders is a good movie, or a great movie, or an immortal movie in film history, b/c I believe that to be an established fact. Twenty-seven years after I first saw it on the big screen in Murray, KY, in the summer of 1981, it has lost nothing of its greatness. This is a review about WHY it is SO GREAT. Why it defined the summer blockbuster forever after, why it spawned so many (inferior) wanna-be franchises, why even its own sequels, done by the same creative team, don't measure up and can't measure up. Don't get me wrong - they are wonderful films, enormous fun and far superior to anything else made in the same vein. But Raiders stands alone, the Everest of summer action adventure. Why? #1 - THE DIRECTOR One of the best directors in film history. Spielberg, a lover of classic Hollywood films, was the perfect director for this project. He's also a director who could go toe to toe with Wyler, Hitchcock, Lang, etc.#2 - THE ACTORS The casting of actors who were virtual throwbacks to golden age Hollywood stars. Ford/Bogart, Allen/Bacall, Freeman/Rathbone and Lacey/Lorre were perfect fits and brought more to the table than just their performances, by evoking the greats of yesteryear.#3 - THE STUNTS The celebration of serials. The legacy of Republic serials and their amazing stunt team (Yakima Cannutt, etc.) is homaged like nowhere else in Raiders. The idea to take B-movie serial pacing and cliffhanger stuntwork and make an A movie out of it was genius. Thank you, George. Indeed, one reason for Raiders' greatness is that it took all the best bits and left little for any of the other films. Swing over pit, collapsing temple, boulder tunnel, automatic spikes and darts, (that's just the first five minutes), burning building, fistfight with multiple opponents, poison, snake pit, fight around propellers, horse to truck transfer with Cannutt's signature travel under the wagon -- any of the great serial cliffhanger death traps not done here were done in the second film. What's left? #4 - THE MACGUFFIN The Ark of the Covenant is THE BEST MacGuffin in adventure film history. Better than the Maltese Falcon, better than the Holy Grail, better than anything. Thank you, Philip Kaufman. I hope you got paid a lot for giving George the idea. No one had done it before, and I don't think anyone will be able to do it again. Let's face it, the Maltese Falcon is just a valuable statue. The Holy Grail is a medieval legend that doesn't even appear in the Bible. But the ARK - it's got the bona fides.#5 - THE SCRIPT The character development, dialogue, pacing -- everything is spot on. Beautifully laid out by another creative artist who understands and loves classic Hollywood -- Lawrence Kasdan. He did his best work here, and it shows. Keeping it a period piece set in the 1930s with Nazis for villains only makes it work even better. The flavor is just right. Note for those writing scripts: Larry has shown you the way. More than three good guys is TOO MANY. We don't have time or emotional energy to invest in more than Indy, Marion and Sallah. (Tolkein split up the Fellowship for the same reason.) 'More characters' is not the answer.#6 - THE EFFECTS Old school photographic effects combined with practical effects. It's still the way to go. We don't like digital. If we want that, we'll go play a video game. Practical effects look fake 10% of the time and digital effects look fake 90% of the time. You do the math. Digital is good for solving the same problems mattes and rear projection used to solve. It's good for erasing C stands and stunt safety wires. Not for creating characters. You need actors for that. This is why the Hulk movies have flopped. It's why Gollum succeeded - b/c so much of Gollum was Andy Serkis. The effects in Raiders are old school taken to a new level of excellence. There is sweat involved, and not sweating over a mouse and keyboard.#7 - THE WRINKLES Raiders was shot quick and dirty. Sometimes, as a result, there are continuity errors. You can see the phone pole sticking out of the bottom of the truck. Marion's shots with the headpiece don't match. If the Staff of Ra is five feet tall, Indy is three and a half feet tall. AND I LOVE IT. Here's why - It's a real movie made by real artists. When a movie is so over-produced and tinkered with that it feels plastic, I hate it. I'm the same way with music. Here comes a guitar solo, but actually it's been built up in seven layers in the studio, each one with a different filter. At this point we're so far away from the guy and the guitar, I don't have a sense of who he is or what his art is about. Unlike a lot of later films, Raiders wasn't made in a Petrie dish. And that makes it fun. Thank God.For these and other reasons, I hold this movie to be one of the top ten Greatest of All Time. Not even the people who made it knew it would be what it turned out to be. That doesn't mean we should give up on action/adventure films, b/c they just aren't going to get any better. It just means we have a high standard, and hooray for those movies that come close to it. And when we experience the disappointment of the ones that try and fail, remember -- --we'll always have Tanis.",10,0,1,21 May 2008
The Illusionist," a classy entertainment worthy of golden age Hollywood
","The Illusionist is a throwback to the sort of film one could regularly expect in Hollywood's golden age, say from 1930 to 1960. The performances are excellent, the magic effects well done, and the production design nothing short of sumptuous. Edward Norton, Jessica Biehl and Rufus Sewell as the magician, the duchess and the crown prince, are the players in a love triangle observed through the eyes of a police inspector(Paul Giamatti). One reason I thoroughly enjoyed this film is that its design elements bear a strong resemblance to one of my favorite films, The Prisoner of Zenda. The illusionist incorporates elements from both classic versions of PoZ, the 1937 Ronald Colman gem, and the 1952 remake with Stewart Granger. It's quite easy to imagine Granger, Deborah Kerr, Lewis Calhern and Robert Douglas in the lead roles in the Illusionist, and that is meant as a compliment to Norton/Biehl/Giamatti/Sewell. Many of the costumes and background characters are lifted directly from Zenda (check out the railway attendant at the end of the Illusionist and the railway customs man at the beginning of Granger's Zenda.) Even the rare Montenegrin Gasser revolver from PoZ 1937 makes an appearance. And when was the last time we saw an iris open and close in a contemporary film? Star Wars? Even the cinematography evokes old Hollywood. Throw in a good plot twist, a supporting actor who is the spitting image of Laurence Olivier, and some of the classic magic tricks of the era (Eisenheim opens his first show with Robert-Houdin's the Orange Tree) and you have a winner! A wonderfully romantic picture and highly recommended.",8,0,0,5 September 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Capital, Watson, capital!
","As a lifelong Holmes fan, I was very much looking forward to this film and I was by no means disappointed. It's just excellent on so many levels. Can't wait for the sequel! GREAT STUFF: Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law, Mark Strong, indeed the entire cast did a wonderful job. Watson's bulldog. The FIGHTS. The GUNS. All the design work (sets, costumes, etc.). The dockside explosion sequence. All the playing around with time(Here's what's going to happen/let me explain what just happened). Hans Zimmer's score is terrific as well. There's just a lot to enjoy here. Robert Downey, Jr. continues his amazing comeback, although it's something more than that. He was never as big as he is now, with so many terrific artistic and commercial successes under his belt in past five years. (Good night and Good Luck, Zodiac, Tropic Thunder vs. Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes, Iron Man 2) Good for him. Bring on the SEQUEL!",9,2,5,27 December 2009
