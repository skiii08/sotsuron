The Devil's Advocate," Well worth the time.
","This is a well-done movie with an interesting story line and some unusual, difficult to predict, twists at the end. Pacino is generally superb and quite believable, though his script is a bit weak at times. The supporting actors are capable, though not spectacular. Special effects are sparsely, yet effectively, used. All in all, an enjoyable couple of hours for most horror/thriller movie buffs.",8,0,1,17 July 1999
