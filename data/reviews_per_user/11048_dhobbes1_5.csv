The New World," Yet another phony dredging up of 'Pocahontas'.
","It's bad enough that Disney did a complete sanitizing of the John Smith - Pocohantas tale, including misrepresenting her as an adult so as to better palm the story off on kids. Now, we have 'The New World' (DVD) which gives a romanticized account of Smith (Colin Farrel) as a smitten pedophile whose earnest devotion wins this child-woman (Q'orianka Kilcher) over after she bravely defies her father Smith's life. So, Hollywood still has as much trouble as ever in getting real about history. Fact is, Smith and Pocohantas were never more than good friends -- that business about sparing his life simply was ritual the Algonquin nation performed when they took prisoners. The rest of the movie similarly is cut from whole cloth, spinning a yarn that, actually, on top of being fictional is poorly directed and, accordingly, would have to go backward to move any more slowly. Quite sickeningly, it close on a smarmy, heart-warming note without even a mention at the closing credits of how Pocohantas, a young and still-flowering woman, met her end as a casualty of English 'discovery' and 'exploration' of a land its indigenous inhabitants already owned. Christopher Plummer and Christian Bale, as John Rolfe, the Englishman with whom she did get involved and eventually married (one of the few real events in this overdrawn, melodramatic fantasy) are gifted actors put to absolutely no good use. If you have to miss one film, make sure this it.",1,2,9,2 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Josh Hartnett as a hapless maverick in this twisting suspenser that is not to be missed.
","What a find. You've got Josh Hartnett as a hapless maverick in this twisting suspenser that is not to be missed: if you liked 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Confidence', you're gonna absolutely love 'Lucky # Slevin'. It grabs your attention right away, keeps you engaged, has you completely hooked and then puts you away with a climax you couldn't see coming without a crystal ball -- though, in hindsight, the foreshadowing was right there for you. The supporting cast kills. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are wonderful as cold-blooded crime lords. Lucy Liu continues to show strong range Hartnett's perky, impromptu gumshoe of a love interest (they must be paying her the ranch to mark time as one of those lead bimbos in the 'Charley's Angels' franchise) . And there's Bruce Willis who, true, has never shown a great of range, but works very well here as the low-key, wildcard catalyst. Plus Stanley Tucci and a Robert Forster cameo. You can't go wrong with this one.",10,3,6,1 May 2007
Deja Vu," New, improved sci-fi in which a federal agent does richly rewarding time-travel
","Excellent foray for Denzel Washington, Paula Patton and James Caviesel. Though Val Kilmer is accorded short shrift in a supporting lead that may as well be an also-ran . Director Tony Scott delivers a sad. conspicuously hackneyed turn, going for a format that values schmaltz over of solid art. Thankfully, Washington carries the ball well and gets to show appreciable depth (it is still amazing that he won his leading man Oscar for a shallow-as-two-inches-of-water fake-job in Training Man when this premiere performer consistently has and still does much better -- think Out Of Time, Man On Fire and Inside Man). This time out, the gifted actor plumbs subtle depths to afford vaguely engaging dimension, supported by Caviesel's superb character-work and newly rising Patton establishing cast-iron chops. As for the script, well, it intrigues, but still needs work. The cast carries the day.",8,0,0,29 April 2007
The Alamo," 'The Alamo': handsome propaganda.
","'The Alamo' yet again gives us history a la Hollywood. An excellently directed, wonderfully acted crock.Tragic as the 1836 slaughter at the Alamo was, the defenders were not valiant patriots who nobly sacrificed themselves for a great cause. They were land grabbers making an opportunity of the Mexican revolt (sadly, the film makes little of the Mexican defenders at the Alamo, the only ones there fighting for independence). The dictator, Generalissimo Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, wasn't trying to take Texas because Mexico wanted what didn't belong to it, he was determined to keep what was left of an expanse that once included not only Texas, but what would become Utah and Nevada. Dictator or not, he had a right to rage war against interlopers who were stealing incredibly valuable land from his nation. Also overlooked in the filmmakers' biased account: Juan Seguin and the other Mexican defenders were double-crossed the first chance Texans got. Seguin survived the battle and led a company with Gen. Sam Houston as Houston defeated Santa Ana at San Jacinto. Seguin was subsequently back-stabbed as, in the aftermath of the revolution, towns began expelling all Mexicans. After Seguin went on to help defeat a Mexican expedition against San Antonio in 1842, Anglos who'd been his comrades-in-arms turned on him with trumped up charges of treason. Vigilantes drove him from the city where he was born and forced him to flee to, of all places, Mexico, where, needless to say, he didn't get a warm welcome. Kind of takes some of the hero-worship out of the whole affair. For good measure, one of reason colonists were up in arms against Santa Ana in the first place was that he declared slavery illegal. When Jim Bowie and William Travis showed up at the Alamo to fight for liberty, each brought a slave along to wait on him. The whole thing boils down to the infamous edict of Manifest Destiny. The movie, of course, steers clear of this aspect. Which is a lot to simply overlook. And it's too bad because Hancock made a beautiful film with a strong cast of Dennis Quaid, Billy Bob Thornton, Jason Patric and Patrick Wilson as Houston, David Crockett, Bowie and Travis. The performances are masterful, conveying such humanity that you find yourself thoroughly engrossed in these characters and their fate. As well, skilled actors Emilio Echevarra as Santa Ana and Jodi Molla as Seguin acquit themselves admirably (especially considering they are handed two-dimensional characters to portray). The Alamo is a powerful film in the same way that director D. W. Griffith employed groundbreaking artistry to create the propagandist landmark, Birth of a Nation.",3,1,11,2 May 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Fictionalized account of Idi Amin
","With 'faction' flicks, you never know -- unless you're already up on the subject -- what license is being taken. That aside, Last King of Scotland is a tour de force for Forrest Whitaker, a strong actor who finally get to show just how amazing he can be. It's also a nice showcase for Kerry Washington as one of his wives. One thing about which there can be no doubt, it gives an unnerving account of a man who indisputably was one of the most brutal power mongers ever known to walk the earth. You want to talk black- on-black crime? This is a horrifying example (as is Tears of the Sun) of how Africans are in way above the sort of atrocities that characterized Hitler's holocaust inflicted on millions of Jews. It's a profoundly disturbing experience about a monstrous individual whom Whitaker brings to full life with riveting immediacy.",10,0,2,25 April 2007
