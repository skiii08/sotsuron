Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," ..but don't forget to think
","Sacha Baron Cohen is a fantastic actor and social commentator. He had been doing similar work for years, but this movie allowed him to reach a much larger audience, and get much more attention than he would have ever attracted through television. With a bit more of a budget, he has made a great film to cement Borat in cinematic and pop culture history.While I have the utmost respect for Cohen and do not believe he is racist or ill-intentioned, I do worry a bit about people using the popularity of Borat as a green light for humor that actually IS racist or ignorant. Borat is funny because it exposes the ridiculousness of such behavior, and encourages us to question the roots of our own xenophobia. Cohen is not making fun of Kazakstan, he is making fun of our own ignorance of other countries, of the latent feeling that Eastern Europe is full of tiny backwards countries where the things he describes are perfectly normal. If people miss this point, then the joke really is on them.",8,2,7,9 April 2007
This Is Spinal Tap," rockumockumentary gold
","This Is Spinal Tap has so many components that draw from distinctly different talents, it's a wonder that it bonds so brilliantly. Remember this is from 1984. The documentary style was hardly a vehicle for entertainment, and people were not used to watching hours of E! True Hollywood Stories, or Making the Band. It must have been a huge risk to assume people would go along with the premise in the first place, then get the satire and irony that make it so funny. Humor changes a lot over the years, but this is a movie that it not going away anytime soon. Lastly, the musical numbers are actually very catchy and clever. This might have been the make or break aspect of the film, because it would be much harder to stay interested in the movie if the band played awful or really boring music. But by the time the credits roll, you're likely to feel like a fan.",8,1,4,10 April 2007
Shooter," good, clean, libertarian fun
","You get what you come for with this movie. It's action, it's Marky Mark, it's lots of things getting shot at. It's also a good deal of libertarian propaganda, which I don't mind since it adds a very distinct color to things. Here's the scoop: Marky Mark just wants to be left alone with his guns in his house in the woods. Is that so much to ask? Apparently, yes, as the stupid government has to come in and mess up his life. He is sought after by sneaky Washington bad guys to help in their bad guy plot, mislead to think he's helping America, which he's a sucker for, framed, sent on the run, and ultimately faces his foes one by one, Bond-style, in an action-packed showdown in the names of honor and freedom. Oh, and there's a girl. That's our Shooter! Come on, it's fun.",7,1,5,18 April 2007
