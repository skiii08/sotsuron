Vertigo," An Absolute Masterpiece
","Hitchcock's Vertigo is nothing short of a masterpiece. From the opening titles, the viewer is told that this is going to be a suspenseful, surreal, and almost trippy experience. Scotty's slow descent into near madness is played out right before the viewer's eyes in a way that makes them feel for Scotty, even as he all but physical tortures and psychologically manipulates another person. On the other hand, we feel for Madeline, despite her involvement with the murders, as we see her as the victim of Scotty's mechanisms. This method of getting us to feel for rather morally gray characters is something hitchcock excels well at, and his expertise at storytelling is certainly on full display here. His use of color and extreme dream sequences help showcase both the plot and inner workings of the characters at play, but also show, once again, that Hitchcock is a master of actual suspense that can feel so rare in modern films. The slow build up to an even slower dedication of it's cast and dismantling of a sense of security and morality make Vertigo an incredible film to watch. And while it's ending is thematically relevant and really ties the story together, the sudden way in which it is presented and then faded to black is really the film's only low point, as it seems rather strange and almost laughable as the film ages.",10,5,6,11 May 2019
Citizen Kane," Fun to Analyze, Hard to Watch
","Citizen Kane is a film that I like to describe as fun to analyze but hard to watch. For a filmmaking buff, Citizen Kane is an all you can eat buffet. Welles' cinematography was revolutionary and his usage of lighting is incredible. There are so many things in this film that make it a technical masterpiece, and stills from the film are the perfect thing to include in a textbook on great movie making. That being said, the actual plot of the film is fun at times, but dreadfully boring at others. The take on storytelling of starting with the death of the character and then following a reporter as he pieces the man's life together was a clever one, but that life takes too long to get through when the journey isn't even the most enjoyable thing to experience. Kane's life was by no means boring, but there were times throughout the movie where it feels like the pacing goes to a halt for good reason. There are a variety of time jumps to get a nice sense of Kane's life, but more could have been done with the characters that knew Kane in the present, as without a more unique reaction to his death (which implies growth or change of those characters) it feels like these sections are mere detours that pull us out of the actual movie.",5,3,5,11 May 2019
Taxi Driver," One of The Best
","Taxi Driver is an interesting film. Featuring some gruesome violence that one expects when watching a Scorsese film, Taxi Driver doesn't go out of its way to try and sugar coat the reality of its world to the viewer. You get a slow build up to the overwhelming dread that this world presents, leading to the audience, at the very least, understanding the actions that Travis performs at the end of the film. The film really builds up to Travis' failed assassination of a presidential candidate, but that's not the most enjoyable part of the film's climax. Travis goes to 'save' a young prostitute in a plan which ends in a bloodbath, almost ending in his death (after an attempted suicide of course.) This scene ends with one of my favorite shots of all time, as the action freezes and the camera slowly pulls out from the scene in a bird's eye view which gives the audience time to reflect on not only the horrific scene that just unraveled before them, but also the events that led up to this tragic point. Even better than that, is the ending, which states, in no uncertain terms, that the world views Travis' actions as just. They know not of his attempts at horrendous deeds, so they hold him up as a hero. What's worse, is the film shows that Travis has no plans on stopping. Truly of masterpiece of storytelling, with excellent cinematography to only enhance the viewing experience.",10,0,2,11 May 2019
Pulp Fiction," Not bad, but strangely not good.
","I had been recommended Pulp Fiction by a lot of people, so I finally decided to sit down and watch it. The result I got was rather mixed. Perhaps it was the the film was overhyped to me, or that it was a non-linear structure (which I admittedly don't like, as it is often done poorly), but nothing really came together in the way I think it does for those that really enjoy the film. The acting is good, with Samuel L Jackson being the standout for me, and the camera work was rather intriguing at times, but I never found myself hooked with the plot like the fans of the movie said I would be. Perhaps I'll enjoy it more with a potential re-watch, but as far as first viewings go, I found it rather lackluster.",5,7,13,11 May 2019
The Wizard of Oz," A Must Watch For Everyone
","This movie is the definition of a classic movie. It has a wonderfully creative premise, which is mixed with a clever use of color and black and white, along with delightful musical numbers. The twist of the Emerald City and the characters that accompany Dorothy are incredible and make for a truly enjoyable time, regardless of the age of the viewer. The story of Dorothy and the symbol of the ruby red slippers truly cement this movie in the hall of fame of cinema.",10,2,2,11 May 2019
