The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The audience clapped when it was over....because it was over!
","This movie was so bad, movie goers all around us tossed out movie etiquette and we didn't even mind. I would have typically been thoroughly annoyed by the lady behind be who giggled through the WHOLE movie - but I couldn't because often I found myself giggling as well. Periodically you'd here an astonished outburst in the theater, 'Oh, no. This movie is so bad.' I was guilty of that as well.The acting is awful and the plot even worse. Granted the book was the worst of the three, but with the budget the film had, I hoped for more from the film. How Bella manages to be morose on her wedding day - is beyond me. There is no joy - or chemistry the only spark is between Bella and Jake. The wedding toast is sorry - save for Charlie. The honeymoon - disturbing and silly. The whole pregnancy and childbirth scenario probably did it's job of keeping girls from having sex or at least using protection. The messages were the most disturbing...Joyless wedding, Painful Honeymoon, Pregnancy that will certainly kill, Horrid Childbirth. All the Cullens where bad - this movie would have been better to focus on the dynamics of the wolf pack (except for the Wolf Speak scene.....STINK!)The only saving grace was how the movie poked fun at the baby's name, because that should have happened.BOTTOM LINE: SKIP the MOVIE and REREAD the BOOK. As my TWIhard 13-year-old daughter said, 'That was a waste of 3 hours.'",Null,20,33,19 November 2011
