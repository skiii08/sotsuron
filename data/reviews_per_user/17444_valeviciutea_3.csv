It," My own opinion
","Firstly, when I read a topic of the film it was attractive and I thought that It will be a very interesting movie. Yeah, I know, trailers of films usually show that the film will be with plot twists, interesting lines and similarly. Entirely not... I was little bit upset cause this film was like a very simple horror story.. ammm.. I couldn't say that it was a horror movie, it was like a bad joke. I don't recommend you to watch it. On the other hand, there were amazing actors, I can applause for that.",5,1,2,16 December 2019

Joker," Feelings
","You can understand this movie from 2 sides. Firstly, you can think that it is a boring story about man which has some troubles with health and he is a killer. On the other hand, I understood that it is the story about the only one man but there is a lot of people like him in the world and we have to understand it. This film was like an example that around us are people with troubles, who feel alone or who are these which anyone can't understand them. We have to open our eyes and help them, talk to them because it is cruel and it can't continuoe any longer.",8,2,5,15 December 2019
