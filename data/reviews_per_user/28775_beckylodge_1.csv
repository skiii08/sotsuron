The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Slow, boring with poor acting
","November 2014 *** This review may contain spoilers *** Let me say it right now; I hated this movie. It was bad. Look, the concept of a being movie cut into two parts just does not work. The whole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and move uncomfortably in my seat. There really wasn't anything special going on as it progresses, too. There was a war going on, but they did not really show it and it didn't suck you in. It was very slow paced with lots of teenage drama and not a lot of 'games' or 'hunger' as in the previous films (which I liked, by the way). And now there was Jennifer Lawrence's acting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; this made the first half boring, wasn't a very good one. And in this particular movie 'not very good' is a compliment. 3/10",3,4,6,5 May 2015
