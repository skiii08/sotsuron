Blade Runner 2049," Did not feel a thing
","The actors performance is great, the filmography very good. The special effects, the sound. They are all very credible and good. I didn't see the first movie. This being said, as a sci-fy fan, I was disappointed with this movie and wish I hadn't wasted almost three hours of my life watching it. I got nothing from it. Didn't feel a thing the whole time. Not because of the acting but because of the lack of depth and meaning of the story. The future sucks. To some, to be a robot sucks too, because they wish they could be human. It could have been brilliant, but it was empty. It truly felt empty.",5,3,5,30 December 2017
A Star Is Born," Beautiful and profound
","I haven't seen the previous versions of this story, so I am probably not the best reviewer for this movie. But it touched me so deeply that I feel I need to write about it.
Bradley did a wonderful job. The movie is long but you don't notice the time passing. It is so engaging and beautiful. It is also so profound. It touches so many issues we humans face. The love story is so rich and it feels so real you can almost touch it.
The music is perfect.
Lady Gaga does also a marvellous job as an actress.
I believe it to be impossible to leave this movie and not feel that it touched you deeply.
I am sadden that the movie came out in the same year as Bohemian Rhapsody - my favorite this year - because they both deserved all the oscars.",10,0,2,2 February 2019
Aquaman," Soso
","Entertaining enough to see but clearly bellow average for the genre. I love this type of action movie (fantasy) and this one, though enjoyable, didn't meet my standards at all. It was okay. There are great movies within this line of story (superheroes) and this one isn't as funny, as exciting nor as beautiful. Nicole Kidman - I admire you as a woman that fights for women rights and I think you are beautiful. Please stop freezing your face (however you do it). It doesn't move and that doesn't favor you.",6,0,0,14 March 2019
The Ottoman Lieutenant," Could have been an epic
","It is a good movie, when it could have been a great one. The acting, image, directing, scenes - they were all very good. The problem was the script. The storyline wanted to be everything and ended up missing. Here is a case where the 'less is more' sentence would have been a bless. They wanted a love triangle and they put it there; they wanted an historic movie. They got one and it was accurate; They wanted action and it is there. In the end you get a lot of information with a lack of depth. Nothing is as compelling as I wish it would be. The history, the love triangle, the true love story, the courage, the intrigue... It all lacked depth and it is really sad, because the story deserved to be awesome.",6,5,6,6 November 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Majestic like Queen and touching
",Absolutely loved the movie. Can't get the critics reviews (have been of the opinion that they enjoy ruining good parties and have to trash whatever they can). Rami's performance is Oscar worthy. The movie plays a wonderful tribute to a legendary band while making the audience understand Freddie Mercury as a person. A singular spectacular artist that I never had the pleasure to have seen alive.,10,4,5,15 November 2018
Dirty Dancing," Perfect!
","Not being a masterpiece in general, it is as a romantic movie. It touches girls/women the most. And I don't know one that saw the movie and didn't fell in love with it. Character lines and music get stuck in our brains forever. I was still longing for a sequel (before PS passing...). I will love it forever. And enjoy re-watching it when it happens to be on TV. Have the DVD, obviously. If you are a romantic, you must see this movie",10,2,3,18 September 2017
The Favourite," 5 stars for the marvellous acting - beyond that I don't recommend it
","The three leading ladies's acting is what makes this movie worth while. I am used to English comedy and I enjoy it. This movie has very few moments of it, they all appear on the trailer. It is too long. Becomes so boring. It could be boring yet be a good lesson in history. I am no expert in Queen Ann's rule nor the historic facts around it. Yet, I do like to learn and felt I learnt nothing to very little from a 2 hour, long, exhausting movie. As a woman I am really sad with this. I wanted this movie to be awesome. You do learn that rulers can be silly (from what I have read after, Queen Ann wasn't the silly child like person it is portraid in the movie) and life in court is not for everyone. I myself ended it thinking I'd rather live in a shack in the woods than having to go through all of that (still not worth watching the movie). In sum, I though that the goal of the movie would be to show the power and intelligence of women in court in a time were very little was thought of them. And in my point of view the movie completely failed in this regard. Very sad.",5,4,9,18 February 2019
Coco," Not at all a winner - in my opinion
","I wish I could make myself rate it lower, just to balance the excessive overrating going around. 
To say it simple, the animated movie felt boring most of the time. In did touch me in the end, perhaps even a tear. But this happened is the last 5 minutes of an 1h40 length story.
I feel the 10/10 rating going on here has to do with the fact that the movie portraits something of the mexican culture, many live in the USA and feel like an overlooked minority.
Nowadays in hollywood: the story is not that appealing but is it about a minority? Then it will be very well rated. I am all for minorities but can you make it more interesting??
This being said, aside from the long and a bit boring story, the animation is fantastic and the ending one won't leave you indifferent. Thus the 6 star rate.",6,2,11,11 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disappointed fan - Did they just kill the brilliance of one of the most stunning sagas ever?
","As a fan of the whole saga I am really sad the last jedi was so disappointing. Special effects were great. Some characters interesting but in the midst of so many characters that should be relevant (and they ate), they lost the opportunity to invest the time needed for them to stand out as much as they should (and deserved to) - Too many important characters in a film that lasts 3 hours is still too many characters. OMG about the script and storyline. We have waited so long to see Luke, the last Jedi and basically what they delivered was hours of a depressed heroe that quit on his job. WHAT??? Solo's son, not believable. We can see that there is still some good in him... Only to find out he might be worst than Darth Vader - in a non-believable way. What else? Too much blasts. IT is actually what I took most out of the movie. Too many bombs and blasts. And a feeling of emptiness. Where are the heroes that never give up? Exhausted, not appealing at al. I am sad, seriously.",2,2,4,31 December 2017
Logan," Why the dark and sad episode?
","I am a fan of the X-Men movies. They are all fun and exciting to watch. They are also beautiful to see. This is not true for Logan. Sadly.The movie isn't fun, the surroundings are sad. The same for the characters. To see beloved heroes turn into decadent sad characters is awful.They do die has heroes. But very broken ones.Other characters are poorly written.And I got the felling, at the end, that the 'bad guys' were stronger, even if the mutant children got away. With the death of Logan, they run away into the woods, scared. No teacher left behind to guide them and teach them to manage their abilities and hopefully save the world.No. They are left alone in a dark world. Their hero was a drunken sad Logan, that didn't taught anything positive.Sad, sad, sad. And ugly.",1,73,174,23 April 2017
The Greatest Showman," Filled with good intentions, could be a lot better
","I love musicals and this movie is a handful of good characters, actors and songs. Can't really grasp were it when wrong. The story shares very good values for our society. It brings light and hope. But it failed to bring me along. I think it may have to do with too many characters worth exploring, and failing to explore deep enough the two main characters. Should it had been longer? Maybe that would have made it better. Or maybe cutdown some scenes that don't bring that much and take too long.",6,4,8,21 March 2018
Deadpool," Tasteless
","Let me begin by saying that I am a Marvel fan. Maybe I wasn't prepared for what I was about to watch. I was later told that this character exists in the comic books. Even so, I don't understand why. I found the character completely stupid and tasteless. I mean, really really stupid and really really tasteless. Why be so grotesque really? Maybe the character from the book was just like this. There is being funny and swearing and being funny doing it. This movie goes way beyond that. It is idiotic and I really can't understand the high ratings.",1,2,9,17 September 2017
Green Book," BEST MOVIE! Hope it wins the Oscar this year
","Great movies like this one are hard to come by. So it is a gift when they do. The art of cinema at its best: when it touches you deeply, makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you understand different realities. It doesn't stay on screen. You carry it with you. This is a tough year for the Oscars, oh boy.",10,3,6,14 February 2019
