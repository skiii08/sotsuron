The Avengers," The Avengers assembles mind-blowing!
","The Avengers ReviewOn Friday 27.04.2012 I dressed myself with my Captain America t-shirt, and went to watch The Avengers in 3D. I was really excited and the movie was mind-blowing. I was expecting this movie to be good, but not as great as it was. I can still criticize it a bit. I think that the way the characters were introduced was mostly good, but I think that the Iron Man introduction was not the best. I think they shouldn't showed Iron Man in his suit. For those viewers who haven't watched any of the earlier Iron Man movies; it would have been better if we saw Tony Stark/Iron Man without his suit. I think it's important that people who doesn't know the characters get to know the human inside the suit. That isn't much of a problem from me, who have seen Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This is just something which could have been a little bit better for those who have not seen any Iron Man movie. This movie is better than all The Transformers movies, but the same thing is repeated here. The thing that I'm talking about is that a kid is talking about what he saw, and he thinks its super cool and awesome. I've seen this in many movies before and I don't like it much. In reality it would have most likely have been considered a serious and dangerous incident. I don't think any kid would have reacted that way, because kids are smart enough to understand that what was happening was really dangerous. In this story, New York is being attacked from a different place in the universe. They get there through a portal that Loki opened for them. In this story everybody should still have been shocked after they won the war. I really don't think there would be anyone who was talking about it being cool. There is one woman who reacts in a much more realistic way, she was very thankful for Captain America and The Avengers saving her and them all. That is realistic; they should all be thankful, but not talking about it like it was being an action movie. What I mean is that in that situation a kid would be thankful, and not talking about how awesome it was. In this story it was real, and then I think it's weird that the kid is talking about it like it was an action movie. I know that this is a movie, where the main point is to make it a movie that the whole family can watch. I understand it well on the business part, because a movie that the whole family can watch is a movie that gets more tickets sold. They really need to make as much money as possible, when they have so expensive and amazing special effects. Not to speak of the costs of great actors, make up and great cameras. This is a hard movie to make, and how great it is impressive, there are many great movie makers behind the movie. Joss Whedon have done an amazing job directing this big movie. And Zak Penn did a great job writing the story for this movie, and also did Joss Whedon who's also the screenplay writer for this movie. The movie is an amazing mind- blowing breath-taking experience. I have never seen any superhero movie as amazing in special-effects. The movie has a great cast, with funny lines and you really get afraid if they will die in the fight. Because you like the characters so much, and thanks to the earlier movies you have begun to know them. Robert Downey Jr. is funny as in the earlier Iron man movies. And he plays his character confident, funny, wise and brave. Mark Ruffalo makes the Bruce Banner character a nice and smart person. When he's the Hulk, he is not nice, he is dangerous and wild. Chris Evans plays the Captain America character wise, brave and nice. Chris Hemsworth plays the Thor character confident, god-like, wise and nice. Tom Hiddleston plays his character evil, mad, wise and mighty. He is theatrical actor, who also according to an interview was inspired by Shakespeare's Richard the Third, when he was creating the Loki character with Joss Whedon. The movie is great movie, with good acting. Still I wonder how this movie would be, if it wasn't made to also fit for kids. Movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and Watchmen, is great and not very child friendly. Again The Avengers is still great and I really enjoyed it. It's probably one of the best superhero movies ever made!",8,2,5,28 April 2012
