The Expendables 2," The band is back together.
","Campy action packed funny one liners all based on each actor's stereotype..only thing missing is the gratuitous shower sex scene..good to watch on a Coronavirus stay at home weekend..What ?every movie need to be up for a Oscar nomination?..enjoy all the action stars together..seeing Bruce and Sly together is cool.couple of surprises
Enjoy the effort.you are not Siskel and Ebert.",6,0,0,28 March 2020
