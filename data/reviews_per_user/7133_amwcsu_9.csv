Saturday Night Fever," A near-musical that has realism, grit and charisma.
","Not many musicals or movie where the musical stylings are a part of the film as the cast. Saturday Night Fever works because it shows the world of late 1970's New York City. One of the reasons why: It was done at the right time, not 10 years after, not 2 years before. 1977 was the heyday of the Disco movement...and you cannot get any better than the heart of Disco which is in New York. When someone hears the word 'Disco' they often visualize happy, clean-cut people straight out of a Eight Is Enougb episode having a good time or a rabble of openly gay sex addicts. This movie shows neither.SNF has no stereotypes to flaunt and exploit. The Moreno family is a struggling middle-class Italian family with their tensions. In fact, the main character, Tony is a womanizing, sexist, racist, profane bastard. Most mainstream movies then and now frown on this kind of character. He even rapes his rather attractive dancing partner, Stephanie! How's that for a hero?! Despite the recklessness, domestic abuse at the dinner table, and shameless use or racist slurs, there are bright point in the movie. Tony is devoted to his dancing no matter and he sees it as an art-form. By the middle of the film you want this boorish man to excel to a higher station. SNF is incomplete without the disco known as 2001 and Tony's remarkably impressive dance moves!If only High School Musical were this impressive, serious, and intelligent, not-to-mention daring. Alas, the 2000's have no defining musical style like the 1970's did. In the end, you felt some sympathy for Tony Monero and all his faults. Saturday Night Fever is a classic that can never be duplicated no matter how hard one tries.",8,0,2,17 March 2010
Alien," An Epic to Behold in All its Glory!
","The movie begins in an eerie dead quiet spaceship, then shocks you as the life support systems of the Nostromo activate themselves. You are introduced to bright florescent lighting and our crew is just waking up...you actually feel their reluctance to 'rise and shine'. After being exposed scenes of the usage of technology beyond our years, the Nostromo lands on an alien world...blah, blah, blah. It's all normal sci-fi formula until they come face to face in a alien incubator. Suddenly, Kane is almost assaulted by the alien parasite which was an odyssey in itself.The most famous scene is the most chilling of all. You think Kane is in the clear as he is conversing and eating with his friends until...he vomits, spits, and groans in agonizing pain. The parasite grows and explodes in his stomach!! Now, tell me where the hell can you find an award winning film with this much gore(excluding Saving Private Ryan)? Normally, when things such as said incident happens it's usually in some poorly-directed, cheap, straight-to-DVD droll with a high-kicking pretty boy or some half-wit actress with phony D-cups in the starring role.Anyway, the next hour or so is a deluge of twists and turns. Every time someone hears a noise, you think it's the Alien, that's growing even bigger. One by one, the eighth passenger is devouring the Nostromo's crew leaving only Lt. Ripley behind. This is where it gets intense. You are infected with her sense of impending doom with the invader in pursuit as she attempts to detonate and evacuate the ship.Now comes the sermon: This is what science-fiction is missing...a plot with motion and emotion! Alien is not a dumb-ass, loud, stupid and stereotypical action fair like today: chock-full of CGI, plot holes, and moronic characters that are annoying and useless, and packaged with media hype! No! It's uses the right amount of special effects, plot, and suspense! Alien is a true sci-fi horror masterpiece for the ages! Let's hope the 2010's uses Alien's example.",10,0,1,12 March 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Gem...A True Classic!
","In a decade of lazily-made movie remakes crafted in the most disgusting manner, to the point of the audience rolling their eyes and giving out disgruntled sighs and comments not for the faint of heart, this is an exception. Movies now are nothing more than cash cows for rather evil studio execs producing eye-candy for the stupid and thoughtless! In comes Sweeney Todd. I originally thought that this was another ridiculous millennial horror movie, that fails to keep interest complete with masochistic lunatics abound. But not this time. I was first greeted with a rather melodious introduction by a young sailor saying how glad he is to return home. Then Sweeney chimes in with his more cynical verse done to absolute perfection. In fact, everyone who sings that doesn't usually sing does their part to perfection. I am impressed! Very impressed! The songs enables you to feel the characters' emotions! The acting is done with amusement and whimsy, you actually sense the actors' enjoy being in character. Sweeney Todd is pure musical ecstasy and a study in human psychology/duality until the end. Yes, the ending. It's one to be remembered. It's no longer child's play or the musical with whimsy it was at the beginning. Spoiler! Heads up! Sweeney in total ignorance kills his wife (who has gone mad because of his absence and from Judge Turpin's advances turning her into a beggar) throws her down into the cellar where men are turned into meat pies. Second, is the scene where Mrs. Lovett is tossed into the huge fiery oven and burned to a cinder and you the audience see her do so while screaming bloody murder. Nice! And the last but not least, the boy taken in by Lovett kills Todd in revenge for Mrs. Lovett. Sweeney is left bleeding to death cradling his wife in a fatal and silent reunion. Sweeney is a wonderful film and a wonderful musical. The funny and odd thing is that its has a gross usage of the infamous CGI! Not may movies can hold up this standard. Let's hope Alice in Wonderland is another hit in the world of Gothic depiction.",Null,1,2,12 March 2010
The Aviator," I actually liked it !!!
","I give this movie 9 out of 10 for the rather unusual color scheme the director picked. It has the appearance of a colorized black and white movie from the 1920's and 30's. Not bad for a film made in the era of bling-bling and grotesque remakes. We are introduced to the life of Howard Hughes, eccentric millionaire and ace pilot. DiCaprio plays this character with Titanic-like perfection that is tolerable for someone who still sounds like a 16 year-old going through puberty. The special effects are wonderful and not overblown excuse to cover up horrible acting. Cate Blanchett makes a terrific Kathrine Hepburn the way she sounds and behaves is uncanny. The only thing that is missing from that performance is the famous quote: 'You're my night in shining armor.' But what really makes the movie stand out is the 'Big band-style Jazz' that leaps out at you and makes you a part of the film. In the age of CGI overload and the industry cries of priacy despite the retarded decision to churn out silly dimwitted comedies such as 'Garfield' and 'Taxi' (not the 70's sitcom)and horrible remakes case-in-point 'The Dukes of Hazzard' there is hope and sanctuary from these mindless experiments gone awry. Film such as 'The Aviator' are one of those sanctuaries for our viewing pleasure. 'It can't be! Hollywood still actually makes movies?' Maybe I was a little too hard on the new generation of films, but it's not the same as in ages past.",9,1,2,6 June 2006
American Psycho," A Devilishly Good Time!
","Very few horror films are entertaining. In fact, most horror flicks are morally flawed, disturbing, and too dark natured. It makes you hate humanity or at least question it. The characters are even worse than the things they do. They're often psychotic, half-human wild-eyed mutants that kill without the consulting of a conscience. Horror is anything evil and sadistic....not fun!American Psycho is an exception to the rule. Here we have mild-mannered, clean-cut, and charming Patrick Bateman who has a lucrative career as an investment banker in Lower Manhattan, a million-dollar apartment high-rise, and a 6-figure bank account, and snotty, elitist attitude to boot. But, our snotty Yuppie friend has a secret....a dark secret! He happens to be a serial killer that can't be caught! How's that for terrifying! A Yuppie who's a douchebag, pompous jerk, a nerdy white guy is his own right and has a fetish to murder people.AP is not your average horror film. There's no gore aplenty like in Friday the 13th or the Saw franchise, well there's the part where Bateman chases and eventually kills a woman with a chainsaw down a flight of steps and the bloody scenes inside Paul Allen's apartment. Most of American Psycho's horrid lure is based solely on human psychology wrapped in avant-garde surrealism of 80's Wall Street flash. It's all about craving for absolute attention and being considered a nobody even when you have everything you could ever desire at your feet. Bateman(played by Christian Bale) is both a disturbing and comedic character. Bale's performance has motion rooted in satire and mocks the upper-class lifestyle with perfection. In fact the whole cast except Willem Dafoe and Chloe Sverginy are satirical foils which are at first humorous, then irritating/annoying, then detestable.The truth is almost every male in this movie is a self-centered assholethat behaves more like a spoiled teenage girl in a locker room gossipping with her friends rather than executives in a boardroom. All they do is compete and talk behind each others backs. You still have the pompous jerk alpha male, the slut, the pure innocent girl, the geek, and the killer himself. With all horror films, the jerk, old bum, a few sluts, indeed get murdered, but it's done so brilliantly and with such discretion. American Psycho is enjoyable for having already obnoxious and rather stupid characters meeting there demise(except the homeless guy with the dog in the alley) that deserve to get killed. You're catching yourself cheering for Patrick Bateman whose the serial killer! Wow! A horror movie that makes you think is a wonderful experience that no one ever experimented before. It's like Sweeney Todd, only this time no one loses an eye and fun doesn't seem to stop! My only criticism is that it could've used more of the 1980's stylistic touch, pastel-colored clothing, a Ferrari Testarossa speeding down Fifth Avenue, etc. What American Psycho should've done was focus on the mid-80's which truly defined the decade in question and evolve into the early 1990's. Because no one remembers 1988 and 1989 that much.",9,0,0,18 March 2010
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not Bad...Still
","Don't get me wrong, I do NOT hate Terminator 3. In fact I think it completes the story, unless they do a T4(which is unlikely due to the main character's current position in politics) what I do hate about this film is the fact that they changed directors. WHY?!!! No other director can provide the fantasy and the magic that only James Cameron can provide. He came up with the idea for 'The Terminator' in the first place! Having a Terminator movie without him is like the Beatles without John Lennon. Now that is out of the way, the action holds your attention like the first two films did. The car chases weren't that as exciting as the 1984 original, sorry. T3 doesn't have the 'psycho killer' mystique of T1 or the violent barrage cliffhanger feel of T2, which this movie obviously needs. T3 becomes interesting in which the first couple of scenes in which John Connor's lieutenants were killed one by one in this time. One was a slackjawed pothead executed during a party!! I love potheads you might find on Dude, Where's My Car executed by a stranger with a gun. Thus proving that Terminator 3 is a film that has its moments. It gives very interesting plot twists that no one...I mean no one sees coming. Like the fact that 'Judgement Day' couldn't be stopped...(I know this sounds trite)only to be survived. Not only that but Skynet was created by cyberspace all current technology. Which is very chilling that something that lethal can be under our noses without our knowing about it. The action was just similar to Star Wars III but not as epic. To some degree it was comical, not a white-knuckle face off, which a Terminator movie should have to begin with. The ending wasn't that grand, it could've been better. The effects could've grander and in disturbing detail with people burning to a crisp and the full effect of global chaos. In conclusion, this was not a boring movie,this is an interesting one that should've done better.",Null,0,0,18 October 2006
Die Hard 2," Logic and intelligence from the first film is gone!
","The plot of the terrorists reeking havoc at Dulles International Ariport seems to be a challenging, yet interesting plot. Action sequences are definitely 'Die Hard'...well authentically to say the least. It wasn't as intelligent and intense as the original. This movie in general had a: 'Seen it! Been there, Done that!' feel to it.Spoilers Detected!!! The only intense moments in the entire movie was when the plane full of holiday travelers crashed, exploding on impact and McClane ejects from the plane set to explode within seconds. THAT'S IT! Other than that it's has no more action than Airport disaster films of the 1970's!What really doesn't make any sense is the middle to the end of the film. The planes have no other option except circle the airport until they run out of fuel. Are you kidding me? There has to be dozens of alternative airports to land at from Logan in Boston to Charlotte, North Carolina! Did this director fail geography as a kid or something, because he seems to be very ignorant of eastern seaboard. Why must they all land at Dulles; was there a law? No it was Hollywood Logic: 'They must have something to tie the movie together' Seriously dude, you've could have done a lot better! Get this! The jumbo jets land in a field big enough for a number of them. What? How? Without crashing into one another or collapsing the landing gear? Impossible! What kind of narcotic was Renny Harlin huffing, snorting, and/or drinking when he directed this? Was he drunk or in La La Land? Another weird moment is when some of the evacuated passengers are not wearing any shoes! You're in a snow field and it's cold enough to form deadly icicles(below 32F) why would you be without any shoes and protection from a coat? Ever heard of frostbite and hypothermia ?! Give me a break! The planes weren't in any danger surely they would have time to grab a coat or something, Jeez!Sadly, Die Harder joins the universal hall of fame for cheesy airport disaster melodramas that only a mediocre Hollywood director like this bozo and a ratings hungry bastard of a 24-hour news network can only fantasize about. I can't believe that I actually wanted to buy this movie on VHS!",2,22,37,2 February 2005
Independence Day," A Sci-Fi Classic? Hell no!!!
","Independence Day is a very interesting title for an alien invasion movie. In fact the 15-mile wide ships are also an interesting concept which is the only intriguing aspect of ID4! Will Smith's Capt. Hiller adds a humorous twist, but he's unconvincing as an Air Force Captain. He's like the Fresh Prince with a rank in the service. Overall ID4(why they call it that? I don't know), it's not worthy of my calling it a 'film'. It's a movie and a rather clichéd one at that. Like the Michael'Ka-Boom'Bay version of Transformers 11 years after the fact, it's a bombastic disaster movie that's the mid-1990's rendition of the Posideon Adventure, Airport, and Earthquake right down to the token multi-vocational, multi-ethnic cast. Some critics and viewers see as a cinematic display of American jingoism and arrogance. I think they're right on the money with that sentiment. Why should only the USA be the only nation of people to stand up to these creatures? Why should the USA have all the answers. Why couldn't Japan, the UK, Canada, or even Australia have the answers! Instead of original characters we're exposed to token ones that are a rehash of characters from their other movies. For example, Jeff Goldblum is clearly re-enacting his Dr. Malcolm/Jurassic Park phase. But, that's not the reason why I don't necessarily like ID4. I don't like it because all the alien ships seem to do is destroy famous landmarks such as White House and the Empire State Building. They just kill for no reason other than the thrill of killing humanity(very vague if you ask me!)It's most clichéd because its tired message of 'humanity must work together in peace' Oh brother! Independence Day is nothing but 'boom' bang' 'BA-DOOM!' There is no thoughtfulness and intelligence just...absurdity. This example is bringing down the alien empire with a simple garden-variety computer virus! A friggin' computer virus are you shitting me?!' How the hell do these people know that the alien ships aren't immune to such electronic contamination?! These are extra-terrestrials we're talking about, here! The next example is the psychically destroying the ships with thermonuclear weapons. What? Hasn't Emmerich ever heard of EMP, nuclear fallout, and atomic shock waves?! Unbelievable.If you are going to make a movie about aliens invading Earth, do it with thought, pizazz, and a better f&*king reason to raze the cities of the Earth other than just for the hell of it!!! Seeing million of people cram the highways at the last minute is a stupid sight in itself. Haven't we seen this before in the movie the Day After and Earthquake? Let's do something different other than a resurrection of 70's melodrama. In conclusion, Rolan Emmerich is just as bad as Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay only he brings the absurd doomsday element into his movies. People like him and his contemporaries must be stopped!",4,2,4,18 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Great! The only movie from this century that I want to see over and over again!
","I had been waiting at the edge of my seat for 'Episode III' to come out. That way, it answers every question any true 'Star Wars' geek ever asked since 1977. We now know how Anikin Skywalker became the menacing and ruthless 'Darth Vader'. Remarkable transformation, though. A duel with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi on a volcanic planet, Mustafar caused him to lose his remaining limbs and burn to a crisp resulting in him wearing that infamous black suit and helmet with that eerie breathing pattern. Chancellor Palpatine does a remarkable job of being the heinous 'Emperor' which gives the film an added dose of 'cred' to the sci-fi set. Samuel L. Jackson does give the appearance of strength and power to Ep. III, but seems to be miscast as Mace Windu. But Jackson has become a fixture in the past three movies, so much so, that I can't imagine putting another brother in his place.The love story of Anakin and Padame is sappy and melodramatic and could've been more bolder and convincing. I have a real problem with the dialog for starters sounds mediocre and not as well rehearsed or as modernized and bold in which the original three films use the occasional 'hell' and 'damn' would have spiced up the feel or Episode 3. Why would you sensor this cult phenomenon? I'm not saying turn 'Return of the Sith' into 'Pulp Fiction' but give it that tongue-in-cheek modern language we saw in the first Star Wars in the 70's.But what really annoyed me with the fact that most of this movie was a CGI dependent. I'm gonna' make this clear: 'Star Wars should be part real-world setting, part puppetry/scale modeling, and part CGI...NO MORE, NO LESS! ' Too much CGI cheapens the craft and believability of your film , too much old school special effects make it seem dated and corny. 50-50 would've won over many fans of the new generation. Nonetheless, this film has the action and the feel of the Star Wars saga, with its bold political statements such as the 'Rise of the Empire' and the 'Rise of the Rebellion' over the top and have the traditions of the epic battles of 'Star Wars' that made it famous.",9,0,2,1 September 2006
