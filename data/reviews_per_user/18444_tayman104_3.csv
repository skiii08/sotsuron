3:10 to Yuma," Just as Good as the Original
","3:10 to Yuma is one of those few remakes that's on par with its original. A desperate, down on his luck rancher, Dan Evans, played by a very convincing Christian Bale volunteers to traverse a dangerous outlaw, Ben Wade,(Russell Crowe) to a train that will take Wade to a Yuma prison. Bale and Crowe are two of the best male actors today and they're excellent to watch on screen.Major props should go to screenwriter Michael Brandt(2Fast 2Furious), for weaving a story that has added even more heart to an already excellent original. Ben Wade and Dan Evans aren't stereotypical good vs. evil characters. They're complex leads who have backgrounds that pave the way for the people they have become.The story might get a little too compact in the middle with everything from Native Americans, Ben's gang, and tough train workers put in the story, but it's all made up for in the end where an exceptionally well directed climax is installed.The Acting is superb, the action is top-notch, and the story is original. 3:10 to Yuma is a western that won't be soon forgotten.",7,1,4,9 September 2007
Training Day," Denzel deserved the Oscar
","I've heard many complaints about Denzel Wahsington not deserving the Oscar, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. Denzel Washington gives a solid performance in his role as Alonzo Harris. Most viewers aren't used to seeing him in bad guy roles where he's the one everyone's rooting against. He pulls off the performance amazingly, and when I watched the film I was just shocked.Not only was Denzel's performance great Ethan Hawke's character Officer Hoyt was also well written. Ethan and Denzel had a kind of chemistry during the shooting of the film that was just excellent. (especially the sheep and the wolves speech) Training day is just a great film, which tells the uncensored story of a officer trying to learn the ropes of his job. The movie falls into the three act structure perfectly. That's pretty cool sense the movie takes place in a single day.",8,1,12,12 December 2005
Inside Man," Another Great Spike Lee and Denzel Washington Hit
","Spike Lee and Denzel Washington collaborate once again to make an outstanding movie. Inside Man is about a group of bank robbers that appear to be involved in a bank robbery gone wrong and it turns into a hostage situation. What makes it so special is that the bank robbers have a pretty cool plan to get out.Clive Owens and Jodie Foster star. They do an okay job, but the script didn't exactly give their characters an opportunity to really shine. Their characters weren't dull, just not very special. Denzel Washingon however was really fun to watch as a New York detective.Many people complain about major plot holes, but there really aren't any major ones, just small things. If you can let those small things just go you can really enjoy the movie. The movie got a little jumbled towards the end, but it was still good.Bottom Line: A very interesting heist flick",7,2,4,27 March 2006
