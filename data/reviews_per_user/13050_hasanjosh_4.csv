Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A Screenwriters treat.
","Butch Cassidy and sundance Kid is regarded as that work of cinema which must be equally read and analyse as it should be watched on screen. The cinematic experience that it takes the viewer into is spell bounding.The screen writing is one of the aspect which compels a learner of cinematic nuances to visit and revisit it again and again Friendship with a rather romanticized male bonding where Butch and the Sundance Kid in their exploits of love,robbery,chase radiates a childlike innocence in every action. The old treacherous western badlands and monuments valleys where the outlaws and bounty seekers co exist gives the screenplay a gripping edge. The cinematography is enthralling and so is the tight screen writing.One can feel for the fallen heroes of their kind without necessarily eulogizing them.",Null,1,2,14 June 2016
Avatar," So Scientific yet so humane.
","James cameron explores the pristine land of pandora where man goes to quench his thirst for mineral deposits and extraction in the process disturbing the intricate biotic environment of the species.A visual treat with some of the path breaking technology and VFX makes the movie an enriching experience.Themes such as mining for greed,displacement of the natives and the divine power of nature are so debatable in present as they were in past.Sam Worthington and Zoe saldana as the paraplegic marine and the Navi Neytri impresses the most.Heart touching message regarding Sustainable development and mantainence of fragile ecologic balance. A must watch!!.",Null,0,0,14 June 2016
The Departed," Revisit the old school of cinematic nuance.
",Simply superb!!. Brilliant screen writing together with intense direction and acting clubbed with tight editing makes it top class.The pace of the film is what you grips in. Starting from the first shot the story telling is of the highest level where the characters are on this thin line of good and bad with each surpassing the other territory sometimes briefly or sometimes permanently.The biblical themes of crime punishment and redemption gives the plot an interesting look. Martin Scorsese getting an Oscar finally for direction and remarkably what a fine film to be the medium.An ensemble cast together with technical expertise makes it a definite watch for all those who cherish good cinema.,9,0,2,14 June 2016
