The Ring," Inspiring Horror unnapreciated by those who dont get its intentions
","I will say it right now that the Japanese version of Ring is the superior film, but this is a damn fine effort that shouldn't be ignored for that reason.Like the original, the whole point of the film is to take a slow creepy ride towards a climax that will shock you beyond belief. And in that it succeeds. We dont need to know all the details. To those that think a video will kill you in 7 days is preposterous, then leave this alone, as it does not cater to the likes of you (narrow-minded). if however, you take it at face value and enjoy the package that you have, you'll be in for one of the best and scariest horror films in a long time.the music is perfect, the shock scenes are well timed, but the restraint on the REAL Horror until the end is the best aspect of this movie, and one that should not leave you dissapointed.",10,0,0,26 November 2002
Akira," Information Overload...
","The first 15 minutes of Akira is a beutiful example of one of the main themes of the film. Information overload. Every single plot of the film is thrown into the mix with amazingly chaotic and hectic results which are absolutely spellbinding to look at. The film always captivates its audience, they never want to look away.Perhaps this is because of the beautiful animation, or the original story. Essentially the film isn't perfect. The plot is rather complex, with so many characters and stories running around, it doesn't allow enough time to flesh out all the characters. And the story, while deep and interesting, doesn't really touch on all the issues as much as it should, leaving the film with a few loose ends. But then again one can't help but feel that this is intentional, as the fundamental theme of the film is information overload. The tag line says that Neo Tokyo is about to E.X.P.L.O.D.E. and one believes that!It is by no means one of the greatest movies, but it is a great movie, and one of the best manga's out there. This film deserved to do well because of the obvious effort that went into its production, and that it opened up Anime to us westerners, and we couldn't be happier for it. We needed Akira. Without it there would be far less anime available to us today you can gaurantee it.",10,0,1,30 July 2002
American Beauty," A film that touches everyone.
","This film touched me. It made me open my eyes and look at the world in a new way, it made me appreciate things that I had taken for granted, made me appreciate every day that I am alive, and made me appreciate my family. I'm not saying I was a sad pathetic guy in need of a morale boost. In fact I was a normal guy. Normal job, normal house, normal family. Its that kind of person that will appreciate this movie the most. the normal person. Because it will make you realise one very special and uplifting thing. You're not normal, you're special. Guess what? So is everyone else.Everyone is different, everyone is unique, everyone has the potential to be the happiest or most depressed person they can be, and it is all up to that one person.Kevin Spacey takes us on that journey through Lester Burnham. In this epic tale, we see him become that normal person into someone that realises that he is special, and if the world doesn't appreciate that, then screw it. Its a marvel to behold the transformation, and you cant help but be pulled in by the amazing script, intially off-putting but then embracing imagery and visual style and untilmately tragic ending. It is almost magic. Movies should do this to its audience. Movies are meant to be thrill rides that you use to waste 2 hours away. Its not meant to change the person.This one did, because it knew it was special, and that can be a very powerful thing.",10,0,0,29 July 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Ignore the philistines...
","Continuing from the header, many people hated this movie because they couldn't get their head around the physics defying fight scenes. I ask you. Whats wrong with having physics defying fight scenes? We can have fantasies with huge monsters and trolls and magic spells and wizards, and films with huge aliens attacking the earth, ones with genetically altered spiders biting teenage boys, and films with ancient egyptian mummies waking up and sucking the life out of people. Why can we have those entertaining yet unrealistic flicks which i'm sure a lot of people loved, but those same people hated this movie because of the flying. Why cant you get your head around it!For those enlightened few who can, well done. I'm sure you enjoyed this masterpiece of cinema as much as I did. OK, so the script wasn't as fine tuned as it should have been, and the story did lag a bit in a few places, but the actors gave it their all, and its stunningly shot. I've never seen china look like this. OK, maybe its because its a fantasy (hear that Philistines? Its a FANTASY? That means its not outside the rules for them to fly! In fact I think for a fantasy its incredibly restrained and down to earth. You dont see no magical creatures or spells or wizards and witches in this flick!), but it still looks absolutely beautiful. And the score? Highly deserving or its Oscar. Some people couldn't really appreciate Tan Duns subtle mix of chello and haunting tunes, and very true, its not for everyone. But I felt it was amazing how one instrument could convey every extreme emotion portrayed in the script, from happiness and remembrance to love and loss, it was a musical revelation, and it suited the film perfectly.And Lee's direction was spot on, and partnered with yen Wo Ping, the otherwordly fights were simply spectacular. While i've seen better fights, i've never seen them performed with such Daring abd Bravado before. This is truly stunning, just like the whole film.And if you hate the film, just watch it for Zhang Ziyi. She could beat me up anyday...",10,2,2,1 August 2002
Shrek," Pure Comic Genius - One of the funniest films of all time.
","Has to be one of the greatest comedies ever. The fairly simple story of a fairy tale gone disasterously wrong is filled to the brim with humorous touches, rib-splitting dialogue and wacky slap-stick.Each actor is amazing in their voice roles, clearly all enjoying themselves. Mike Myers is a revelation as the scottish sounding Shrek, John Lithglow plays it up gloriously as the selfishly evil Farquad, Cameron Diaz is the not so princess-in-distress Fiona. And Eddie Murphy? He gives the performance of his career. As the animated Donkey, I have literally never seen (should say heard) him funnier. He literally makes the movie. He definitely brings all the characters together!The animation is beautiful to behold. The environments are realistic and always stay in the background, never too distracting, letting the characters stay at the front of the picture (unlike other computer animated attempts like Final Fantasy). The characters themselves are on just the right side of cartoon and realism, another balance thats rare these days.But its not the amazing animation that makes this film, it really is just the script. For lack of better words, its as funny as hell. From the opening credits that sees Shrek going about his normal routine, to the rib-splitting hilarious closing scene of the swamp kareoke (which is worth admission price alone), this is one constant laugh. Live action films would love to be this funny. What really makes this film enjoyable isn't that it is extremely funny, but that it is CONSTANTLY funny. It doesn't just have its great moments. All the moments come together so well that the whole movie is one great moment. And thats what makes it stand out. Take any scene, any one scene from this film, and it will have 5 laugh out loud moments, hundereds of background jokes and this never lets up, throughout the whole film.It does have more, the adventure and action is well timed and shot, the music is excellently placed, but thats not what this film is about. Its there to make you laugh. And it succeeds. More gloriously than it has any right to.",10,0,1,29 July 2002
Princess Mononoke," The greatest animated film - bar none
","Continuing from the title, this also comes very close to becoming the greatest FILM of all time. Why is that? Because it has everything that makes cinema great. It is one of those rare gems whose total worth is greater that the sum of its individual parts. Every aspect of the movie words wonderfully together to make a sense of harmony that is unique to this film.The script masterfully works its strong characters around an amazing and epic story. If there is any fault to the story, is that it is TOO epic. So broad in scope and range it is, that even at a lengthy 133 minutes long it still feels like its running at breakneck speed. But this also means that there is never a dull moment in the whole picture. Every one of the hand drawn frames is a portrait to this amazing fantasy world. The creatures are animated with fluidity and grace, even when the intention is to make them clumsy and slow. The same can be said for the human characters, that while not looking incredibly life-like, have a marvellously distinct and interesting style.The voice acting is way above par for typical anime. The lip-synch was manipulated to fit the english soundtrack, and it works (like everything else in this movie) incredibly well. And the music? Pure bliss. It brings goose-bumps to my every time I hear it. Why it was not nominated for best original score at the oscars just goes to show the narrow scope the judges look to at that insult to cinematic awards.This is more than just a movie. It is a testament to how meaningful and great cinema can truly be. You will leave this movie feeling elated, inspired, and down-right entertained. For those that dont like this movie, fair enough, its an aquired taste.I call it good taste.",10,0,1,25 July 2002
