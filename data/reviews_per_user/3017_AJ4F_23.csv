The Blair Witch Project," Superficial people won't 'get' this film
","I just revisited Blair Witch and it remains among the top 2 or 3 scariest films I've ever seen, possibly number one. It works on a psychological level that can't be compared to 'traditional' horror attempts. If you find yourself 'trying' to get into it, you're probably wasting your time.I think this movie is best watched alone on TV at night, or with a small crowd that won't interrupt with banal comments. In fact, I don't think you should talk at all during this film because so much of it relies on 'being there' and staying there until the end.I think many people are too shallow or short on patience to get drawn into it, and that accounts for most of the negative reviews. They are simply not describing the same experience had by those who got into it. For me, that happened shortly after the interviews with the townspeople, especially the one with the strange lady at the trailer park. When this film works on someone, it becomes reality, and reality can be overwhelming if you're lost in the woods and the sun is sinking. Negative reviewers try to dissect it with criticisms of the plot and pacing that have no bearing on how it works for a receptive mind. It doesn't need a traditional plot or special effects because it wasn't meant to work on an in-yo-face level. Notice how short some of the bad reviews are? It's as if they were told to hate it and just want to join the fray. Many probably saw it in a big, sarcastic crowd that prevented them from reaching the trance-state that creates so much of the tension.It's too bad I'm defending this film by attacking the personalities of its detractors, but I'm afraid that's necessary! To sum it up, if your main musical fare is Hip Hop or Britney Spears you'll probably find Blair Witch dull. But if you can sit still and enjoy slow classical or ambient soundscapes you may find yourself mesmerized. Flaky viewers (or those who'd never understand their own flakiness) need not apply.",Null,0,1,6 September 2003
The Lobster," Intro scene describes the whole film.
","Apparently the opening sequence showed an actual donkey being shot and it didn't get much better from there. I should have turned it off at that point, in hindsight.The movie was relatively interesting when they were first checking into the hotel, but the deliberate monotone dialog wore thin in short order. Then came more gratuitous violence, but a sterile sort that really didn't register. Grimness and blandness were the main themes. The views of water and woods were good, though.Once they escaped the first time it really lost my interest. I ended up fast-forwarding through it until the depressing final scene. Just didn't understand the point. Not once did I find it funny, and it never made much sense. Normal people are never that flat. If they'd made them at least seem to care about something it could have been redeemed.",3,2,2,23 October 2016
12 Angry Men," A classic study of 'reasonable doubt'
","Before seeing this film - and having never served on a jury - I hadn't seriously contemplated the meaning of 'reasonable doubt' in a legal context. Now, I can't imagine a better explanation than what's shown here. It was amazing that they accomplished so much with a simple set and somewhat stilted acting. There's never a dull moment, as you might expect from a film shot in just two rooms (court and jury).Every juror should watch this film to avoid tunnel-vision, especially if a death sentence is possible. It's common for people to lock on to an opinion and stop thinking entirely. Including those who consider themselves skeptics. The Fonda character represents a proportionally rare critical thinker.Knowing how thick-headed folks can be, especially those who fly the flag of conservatism, this film made me wonder how many court cases are decided fairly vs. hastily. Note the review on this very site titled 'Another Liberal Propaganda Classic.' Courts need to screen for small-mindedness before all else.",9,0,0,20 January 2010
Concussion," Add this to the long list of money-based denials
","Drama-wise, this was quite a decent film. I'm not sure they could have made it much better without faking a more rambunctious personality in Dr. Bennet Omalu, though he seems more animated in real life than Will Smith's depiction.Upon watching this I didn't know the backstory behind the NFL's actions, so it was educational in that realm. It didn't seem to make major, shocking headlines, possibly because everyone knows football is tough.But the NFL's stance was/is no surprise, knowing human nature. It's the age old tale of business-as-usual vs. evidence, be it asbestos, acid rain, ozone depletion, cigarettes, global warming, and most recently the health effects of industrial wind turbines (still being contested). Many more things could be added to the list, of course.Good film.",7,1,1,27 August 2017
The Day After Tomorrow," A satisfying dig at right-wing denial
","Yes, there's some overplayed drama, but I think this film effectively fights denial from anthropocentric conservatives and oil-industry players. I liked the scene where the Vice President claims short-term economic harm is more important than possible calamitous damage from a climate shift. That level of arrogance is common in Washington these days, and millions of Americans get their sound bytes of 'science' from talk shows hosted by Creationists with 2-year business degrees.It's too bad you have to show the average person a rapid tragedy to remind them of nature's power. If they made this movie about 'boring' incremental heating, displacement of crops and slowly rising sea levels, few people would watch it. I wonder if the rapid freeze was the producer's clever way of dispelling Ice Age cultists who think warming is the wrong concern? I wish they'd developed the science angle more but I'm sure they had to weigh mixed audience reaction. They should have explained the warm water 'conveyor belt' more thoroughly because the threat from fresh water intrusion is very real, even if it takes much longer than in the film. We shouldn't assume that, though.",8,0,1,19 February 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Watered-down violence made it less effective
","It's rare to complain about such things, but Hotel Rwanda wasn't violent enough to get the full point across. Someone like Spielberg with his knack for ultra-realistic violence could have done a better job. When you feel like you're watching something real it hits you on a deeper level. There's a lot more to it than gratuitous bloodshed. The unnerving chaos of Africa was displayed much better in 'Blackhawk Down.'This was a case where filtered gore robbed the movie of the outrage one should feel. There were only a few serious cringe-inducing scenes and I expected the whole movie to stay at that level. There was definite unease throughout, but it wasn't quite edgy enough.I think some rave reviews describe what the move could have been and the importance of its theme, not what it actually was. I disagree with those who say the reason for the conflict wasn't explained well enough. It was just a type of gang vengeance and us vs. them, like so many other wars.",6,3,5,11 October 2006
Interstellar," Not much of a 'climate change' statement
","I watched this in large part hoping it would emphasize climate change and other human failings, but it did so in only a vague way, and stressed the point that Man is an 'explorer' more than a 'caretaker.'I found it odd that they put a scientist named Mann on a frozen planet and had him fake data, which seemed like a jab at a famous climatologist pilloried by right-wingers. Are film-makers so cynical and profit-driven that they have to appease every element of society?I found the plot-line ponderous in many scenes, with temporary confusion about who was on what ship as they scouted out the planets. The guy who aged 23 years while they mucked around in the water wasn't explained very well. Did he go into hibernation? Otherwise, how did he not deplete their food supply?Other notable flaws were: Driving through a corn field to chase a drone with no fear of damaging the truck, let alone even seeing the drone with corn that high, and using a laptop to boot. Then he lets his daughter land the drone on her first try as if it's just a toy he was chasing. Too many cutesy Hollywood tactics. The blocky metal robots seemed fragile and impractical for getting around a physical environment. I guess the metal was impervious to damage somehow. They also pegged the Earth's population at 6 billion but it's well over 7 now. Unclear when all the action was going down.The redeeming part of the film was its clever time travel aspect. All in all, I wasn't overly impressed but it kept me entertained. The concept could have been executed a lot better with the same basic storyline.",6,2,9,29 March 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Too many mixed messages and anti-police rhetoric
","While I found this film entertaining, it didn't seem like justice was being done on other side.The mother blamed the police for something that was mostly out of their hands and had a number of criminal elements herself. Her husband was unlikable, and she chose him. I couldn't really root for anyone except the Harrelson character.A scene near the beginning almost put me off the whole movie, with the sarcastic comment about the 'blank-ing environment' when the cop said he could arrest the guy for dumping waste on the grass. I don't like glib attitudes toward nature in any context.When the mother torched the police station all bets were off, and the constant commentary about cops beating up black men seemed like a nod to shady social justice activists.The best aspect of the movie for me was seeing the crass cop come around and do something decent, but he wasn't exactly redeemed for his earlier rottenness.",6,1,4,26 April 2018
The Thing," Just not all that scary to me
","I did find this movie entertaining but it never created the depth of fear that's been ascribed to it. Lots of slow-moving, predictable segments and downright stodgy sequences. It had the feel of an unpolished television movie in many ways.The concept could have been pulled off with a lot more suspense and mystery, simply with better cinematic techniques.It seems like a movie people would enjoy best while drunk, clapping at certain scenes they remembered from previous watchings. One of those films that get an inexplicable reputation from word of mouth, but were never all that great.For a feeling of isolated terror near the poles, I think 'The Last Winter' and especially '30 Days of Night' were much better.",6,1,8,14 September 2010
Tropic Thunder," Uneven pacing & joke timing. Only mildly funny overall.
","Unless this film is best watched under the influence of substances, I can't see how anyone with a halfway sophisticated mind would rate it higher than middling.The intro 'trailers' offered promise of similar clever gags to come, but it seemed like they soaked up more creativity than could be adequately spread throughout the remainder. It became clear about 30 minutes in that this was going to be sub-par. The pacing gave the impression of trying to seem energetic, but it never got a solid rhythm going. Something was just off about the flow of the jokes, and timing tends to be critical when people are meant to laugh. I got the impression of different writers working on different scenes and not quite comparing notes.The Tom Cruise fat-suit character was by far the funniest to me, followed by the Robert Downey Jr. black impersonation, then Nick Nolte's grizzled veteran. Stiller only provoked real laughter in the 'trailer' scenes and a few intermittent moments. Jack Black just seemed over the top and obnoxious.I kept taking note of the uneven pacing, and when you find yourself doing that, you know a film isn't quite working. I found it worth watching, but just barely.",5,2,4,8 October 2010
Gone Girl," Unlikeable characters but mostly entertaining
","I watched this based on some 'best movie of 2014!' comments but it wasn't the dark, brooding mystery I'd expected based on some previews. It had an almost campy feel in too many parts and went on at least 30 minutes too long.I generally don't like plots driven by psycho characters because they're too easy to do, but this was a twist on the usual psycho kidnapper angle and I won't give that away.The problem was that too much seemed improbable after a point, and it began to drag, but the narrative compelled me to keep watching. Decent movie but hardly great. And I wouldn't call the ending satisfying.",5,4,13,15 December 2014
I Am Legend," Well acted and genuinely eerie
","I really liked the atmosphere of this film and the lack of bureaucratic battles often portrayed in 'end of the world' pictures. It had a straightforward way of presenting what happened. You feel genuine fear at times but it's not really a horror film.There were a few factual errors and things I'd change. One worth noting is Smith's mention of '6 billion people' as of 2009, which he uses to calculate casualty rates. The real number at that time will be about 6.8 billion; no small difference. It was already at 6 billion in 1999, 10 years earlier. I mention this because overpopulation itself is making viral calamities more likely.Also, the casual handling of a certain object is, well, too casual, considering its purpose. Those who've seen the film may figure that out. Those who haven't, get ready to not be bored in the least.",8,0,0,10 July 2008
Children of Men," Good thriller, but the Earth NEEDS a major birth dearth
","This was a compelling film from an action and drama standpoint. A road/suspense movie with an unusual twist. The gunfire and fighting scenes were some of the most realistic I've seen vs. the usual overstated noises and hits. Never a dull moment in that realm.However, since the world's population (as of 2010) is growing by upwards of 75 MILLION each year, the planet could use a major birth dearth. We have a technology called contraception that people need to take seriously instead of mindlessly cranking out kids while the world suffocates from human overload. We expect other animals to live in balance (lest we cull them) but the species with the worst population problem keeps encouraging it with self-righteousness, tax policies and general stupidity.The chaos & violence that ensued in this film after 18 years of female sterility is happening in real life for the OPPOSITE reason. People are in constant strife over a shrinking pool of natural resources on this finite planet. Animal life is being decimated for the same reason. Wars are and will be fought over the growing scarcity of land, water, food and fossil fuels. Peak Oil alone could trigger WW-III.No amount religious wishful thinking will make this planet capable of supporting more than a few billion people at modern living standards. The human footprint is said to already be 1.3 times the Earth's innate capacity, with oil and coal being the only things maintaining an illusion of plenitude. Global warming shows the finite capacity of Earth's atmosphere to absorb economic growth and human gluttony.It didn't seem like this film had a particular agenda, pro or anti birth, but I hope it didn't mislead demographically-ignorant people about the root cause of today's problems. We don't need more fools claiming overpopulation is a 'myth' despite rampant symptoms.Projections of 9 BILLION people by 2050, and as many as 500 million in the United States, are depressing if one cares about quality of life over mindless quantity. Environmental problems and species extinctions are hard enough to prevent with 6.8 billion in 2010. The Dick Van Patten fantasy of a yet-to-be-born genius saving the masses is bogus logic. Wise people don't crowd themselves into a corner. They leave slack in the system.I remain puzzled about the ultimate point of this movie and couldn't root for the pregnant woman as a savior. Was she a sign of a 'recovery' (a return to the overpopulation cycle) or just a fluke? They should have made the medical aspect more clear, at least. I originally thought the title might be a serious take on 'Junior' (1994) but in the book, men were the infertile ones, which is more plausible since pollution (worsened by overpopulation) has lowered sperm counts.I gave this a 6 for its production values and acting, minus the premise that I found annoying. Even the 1972 film 'Z.P.G.' tried to create drama out of child-birthing rebellion (against the common good). Why can't everyone just accept that the planet has limits and live accordingly? If the crisis had been presented as a surplus of people I'd rank it an 8. I'd rather see films like 'Soylent Green' that derive their drama from REAL world conditions.",6,2,7,28 April 2010
Event Horizon," The ship's name held promise but the film fell short
","I watched this after reading a Stephen Hawking book in which 'event horizon' was described in terms of general relativity and black hole physics. But the hammering soundtrack in the opening credits warned me that this film probably wouldn't rise to the elegance of that concept. It had too many standard plot devices and was never really scary to me.Here are some issues, starting with most annoying first:1) You'd think that an advanced spaceship crew would be educated like today's astronauts, not blue collar types easily bored by the scientist's explanation of a 'singularity' and other aspects of black hole travel. They'd send the best of the best on such a critical mission, not jive talkers and impatient drones. 'Say it in plain English!' is ridiculously overused in movies and insults an intelligent audience. A real crew of that caliber would understand black holes well beyond his folded paper demo. I know it was done for the audience's sake, but still.2) The steam-punk gravity drive and the general interior of the ship seemed deliberately designed to convey malice, not functionality. It's almost as if the ship was built as a haunted house. Why all the spikes in the doors that humans pass through? OSHA wouldn't allow such a ship to be built. The gravity drive seemed more like a medieval torture device than something modern engineering would come up with. I suppose all the spikes could be related to magnetism but it wasn't explained.3) The blood in the ship's structure had no scientific context. It played like a ripoff of 'The Shining.' This movie was too big on 'fi' and too small on 'sci.' They should have toned down the gore.4) Technical aspects, like the guy in the airlock spewing that much blood and living, or the astronaut being propelled back toward the planet with his breathing pack seemed ludicrous. The electronics damage to the rescue ship seemed impossible to fix. It needed a lot more than skin patches. Why do so many movies show sparks flying from sophisticated instruments which are miraculously repaired in hours?5) The premise that we'd already colonized the Moon by 2015 was ridiculously optimistic, even in 1997.Still, it kept me entertained enough to see it through, so I gave it a neutral 5.I'd recommend 'Solaris' (2002) for a much better depiction of mentally conjured people, etc. The elements of that in 'Event Horizon' were done in sledgehammer style, though the eyeless wife did give me a jolt.",5,0,0,3 September 2013
8 Mile," This film ALMOST made me understand rap music
","I found this to be a semi-pleasant surprise and gained some sympathy for the Eminems of the world along the way. To be honest, if he'd been black I wouldn't have been able to relate much.I also learned what could motivate people to participate in this belligerent, mostly insulting form of music. It seems to be a matter of desperation, plus some innate obsession with rap as an art form. That part must be very internal, since I've never come close to feeling it myself.I find rap mostly tuneless and grating, like listening to people hollering while banging on garbage cans. Prodigal musical talent doesn't seem to be required, just a chip on one's shoulder from life's hard knocks or whatever. This film at least got me thinking there's more to rap than pure criminality. There was still a lot of mindless thug-talk, but not quite of the type I expected. It did open my eyes culturally, to a degree.It seems when you come from nothing and have nothing to lose, latching on to a rude set of 'musical' principles might indeed be your only way out. The Eminem character was lucky to be brighter than the average underdog, and found a way to rise above his situation by sinking into another one.I'll never understand the whole 'culture of attitude' (coming from any race) but this was a well-told story in its own right, enjoyable to watch, never boring, and quite funny at times.",7,0,0,16 July 2010
The Dark Knight," I had to concentrate on staying entertained.
","Good movies should create 'the willing suspension of disbelief,' meaning you forget that it's just actors and special effects. This movie failed to deliver that for me. I kept waiting for it to match the review hype but it only had random moments.The Eastwood/Devil voice of Batman needed explanation. It was too far off from his regular voice, like a crank caller. Was it just assumed to be an identity trick? It was hard to work up empathy for either Wayne or Batman. The best acting I've seen from C.B. was in 'The Machinist' (a far more disturbing and better film than this).Excessive lesions on C.B. and M.G. were distracting in close-ups but that's not unique to this film. M.G. isn't what I would call hot, and it's unclear how she got to be the object of rich desires. She added a dowdy effect that dampened the felt urgency of certain things.Many special effects went beyond fantasy. Vehicle mass defied inertia laws in crashes; like the Bionic Man pushing a building. The bat-cycle was ludicrous in how it could blast every obstacle out of its way. The cellphone sonar was logistically absurd, if even technically possible. I like special effects with some chance of realism. The half face, half sinew thing was well done, but the sudden meanness of the D.A. seemed forced.I found the opening bank scene the most engrossing, promising part. The guy on the street corner dangling the mask had a spookiness I was expecting from the rest of the film, but it washed out. Where was all the 'darkness' reviewers wrote of? I guess he kept kid audiences in mind. The Joker was well done but no more menacing than random creeps interrogated on C.S.I.Most importantly, the plot didn't feel naturally driven by events (see title of review). I think a rare combination of hype and the death of H.L. carried this film to a higher status than it deserved.",6,19,38,27 January 2009
Avatar," Satisfying dig at right-wing/corporate greed and evil
","It goes without saying that the special effects were astounding, but I found myself just as riveted by Avatar's all out attack on a breed of small-minded, petty people who spoil the Earth yet proudly wave the flag, believing they're the Chosen Ones. They deserve zero respect for their rapacious attitudes, among which is the denial of any man-made errors, like AGW.The bad guys in this film are the same types who nearly wiped out the bison in the 1800s, and, at the time of this writing, have done a real number on the Gulf of Mexico's waters. They can also be found spewing lies against the environment on talk shows hosted on networks owned by their kind.To disrespect the very thing that keeps you alive in the name of money & false pride is evil. The value system of these people is beyond corrupt.Yes, there were a number of clichés and strong similes in this film, but all seemed justified. Let's hope more filmmakers have the guts to go all out and not soft-peddle the phony 'conservatives' of the world who don't want to conserve anything but greed and avarice.Very good work, Mr. Cameron!",9,1,8,9 July 2010
Up," Great, except for placement of house
","I rank this Pixar film second only to Wall-E, but part of it bugged me.Sticking a house on top of such spectacular scenery was desecration, especially when the old man tossed out the furniture and junk as ballast.The house might be OK in the forest where it didn't stick out, but a place like that should be left undeveloped. It mimics the real life location of Angel Falls, which is fortunately in a park, protected from construction.At the end we are left with the impression that the house stayed there indefinitely, with the pile of junk next to it. It seemed incongruous with saving the rare bird, etc. It's forgivable considering the spectacle of the movie as a whole, but not trivial.",8,0,1,11 February 2010
The Happening," WHY is this a 'bad' movie, all you copycat reviewers?
","This is as good as anything I've seen from MNS, and better than several of his films. I'd compare it to 'Signs' in many ways. It has a mysterious atmosphere throughout and presents a subtle yet powerful concept of nature vs. Man.I watched it despite all the drones who panned it (including IMDb's editorializing with the 'comedy' category). Some say the first half is good, then claim it deteriorated toward the end, but that makes no sense to me after seeing the whole thing. It has his typical dreamlike quality which somewhat intensifies, but it never seems cheesy, etc.Are the masses unsatisfied unless they absolutely know the enemy? My theory on the negative reviews is the psychology of refusing to be objective once a negative idea is planted, and/or anti-environmental mindsets that pervade America. A number of people will always scoff when human omnipotence is questioned.Be an original thinker, ignore the negative reviews and enjoy it for what it is.",8,5,11,1 October 2017
Inception," It lacked 'the willing suspension of disbelief' that good movies produce.
","There were only a handful of moments throughout 'Inception' where I didn't feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined the directorial staff telling them: 'Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don't ask why right now!'I don't think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what's actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife's forehead, etc. A good film doesn't let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the 'kicks' became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I've experienced, so the main premise of the movie was 'kicked' out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn't fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog.",5,8,12,14 December 2010
WALL·E," What's up with those negative reviews?
","This is the most entertaining (and also prophetic) computer animation I've seen. It's humbly delivered and makes strong points without forcing them on you. I doubt we'd let the Earth look that bad, though a large satellite collision (2/10/08) makes you wonder about space.There's no need to fast-forward in time to laugh at the portrayal of humans here. The visual clarity of this movie is the best I've seen yet. The details packed into it merit several watchings and still-frames.Getting on to my review title, I have a hard time understanding how some people could give this under 5 stars, let alone 1. Were they in a rotten mood the day they saw it? There's no accounting for taste, but actively disliking such an interesting movie is weird to me. You've got to be a miserable sort to not be entertained by something this clever and polished.",9,0,1,13 February 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Powerful interaction between soundtrack and dialog
","A big part of this film's appeal is the interplay between Thomas Newman's soundtrack and the simple yet profound dialog. The CD score stands up as a great work on its own. It alternates between brooding piano and powerful orchestration, with a few oldies added for context.Three scenes, named by corresponding tracks, are especially poignant. The first is 'Brooks Was Here,' followed by 'Zihuatanejo' and 'So Was Red' (that title carries over from the Brooks track). To me, the third is among the most moving sequences in film history. You can't top Morgan Freeman saying 'Get busy livin'...' as the inspiring music plays in the background.",9,0,0,17 January 2006
Signs," A spiritual film, not a monster movie
","Casual online movie reviewers keep missing the true message of films and pan them because they expected something more pedestrian. What high standards we've set for ourselves!To anyone with a little depth, 'Signs' was clearly not meant to be a disaster flick or special effects showcase. The movie is more about a Man losing and regaining his faith in life, God or whatever. In many ways, the alien plot serves as a backdrop to the plight of the characters, though it's center stage all the while. I don't think the movie was meant to be scary in the usual sense. The uplifting soundtrack balances a sense of doom with a promise of hope.Almost the whole film is seen from the angle of an isolated farmhouse and its inhabitants, freeing us from the usual hype of command centers, bickering authorities and views of mass suffering. That's how any average person would witness an alien invasion; from their own porch. And that's what made this movie different for me. I hope that most viewers at least understood why it's called 'Signs' and what those signs meant in the context of a suffering family. I won't call it a completely profound or flawless film but it's certainly compelling and above average.",8,0,2,15 March 2004
