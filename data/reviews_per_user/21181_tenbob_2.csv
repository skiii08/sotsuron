The Blair Witch Project," Worst Movie I have ever seen
","First, let me categorize myself.  I am what is called a senior citizen so I have seen MANY movies.  In addition, I am not an old fogy; I have enjoyed many movies for younger people: Something about Mary for example. This film is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and, believe me, I have seen some bombs.  It starts off weak and goes downhill from there.  The horror was entirely dependant on the prior knowledge that this was a horror movie and I went thru it waiting for something to happen a la Stephen King.  But nothing ever happened until the ending suggestion of something horrible. A total waste of time, money, and anticipation.",Null,0,1,30 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," One of my all time favorites
","The movie breaks many taboos, full nudity of females, without appearing prurient and there isn't a nude take that is not for dramatic purposes. It is about time that people would realize that violence such as in movies about criminals is so much more dangerous to society than is sex and/or the human body.I was partricularly struck by the use of the modified piano tones as a sound effect to create mood.",Null,0,0,19 July 1999
