Skyfall," Sky Fall : This time its something personal abt M
","Sam Mendes who delivered some magnificent movies like American Beauty, of course it won the Oscar, and the likes of Road to Perdition was given the task of making the Bond franchise some upliftment after the Quantum of Solace you got to expect the movie is not that the Bond movie you were expecting. Starting of at Istambul on a mission to get the contents of stolen details of MI6 operatives working in various terror organizations Mr. Bond along with his working field agent chink makes the well worked out start off stunt, bikes, typical Istambul roof top stunt, and concluding on top of train. The agent eventually fails in his mission and puts his credibility at stake along with Madam M. The next thing they hear is they have cracked into MI6 system and blasts and revealing the 5 of their operatives. M then backs unfit Bond to find the brain behind these. Then he moves to Shanghai, to begin his hunt.Then comes the really psychopath Javier Bardem, who gave his ultimate performance in No Country For Old Man, who have some unfinished problems with M played by Judi Dench. This person who steals the show from the moment he comes to the screen. Bond now have to protect M and take her to safety from silva played by Javier. This movie also have a new and smart Q, a young kid, who gave something to laugh abt in those one liners along with everyone else.Sam Mendes here rewrote the traditional Bond movie structure of those techniques and rampage action stunts to well crafted dramatic touch into every scene. Real Bond fans might have some problem to deal with. Daniel Craig had a perfect script to put some a Macho performance along with some core scenes which he delivers. Judie Dench performance was something never looked upon gave a good one too. Skyfall is real experience.",9,1,15,2 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Real Saviour of Gotham City
","As everybody knows Chris Nolan ending this batman series, the only point to note was was it going on a higher note that his previous tales. I bet it struck the bull's eye. The power of the batman rises only with the immensely powered 'bane' played by Tom Hardy who take full control of the Gotham city by nullifying it from the external world with some demand of exploding the city if any one of the police force steps into the Gotham City through the only entrance which is available, the rest being demolished and taking The Dark Knight as his prisoner. The rest is how he comes up from the dust and avenges the Devils with the help of a Catwoman and a few Police officers. This epic conclusion is magnificently pictured and with breath taking moments including some brilliantly captured explosion and a plane high jacking and on and on and on. Special mention goes to Hans ZImmer who brought the music to the maximum level and our own AR Rahman also worked with him. The movie ends with typical Chris Nolan ending who is a master of story telling which he describes each side line story as we here from our grandmother. He deserves a special appreciation along with Christian Bale our Batman who did a marvelous job. The rest are Morgan Freeman, Ann Hathway, Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard where really good.Never miss this movie if u have seen the 1st and 2nd part. And if u haven't seen the previous one's never see this movie in the first place.",10,3,8,20 July 2012
