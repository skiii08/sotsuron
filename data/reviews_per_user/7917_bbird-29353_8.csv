3:10 to Yuma," Illogical Morality/Ethics Lesson
","Teaching your son morality and ethics is an admirable endeavor, but it should at least be rooted in realism and feasibility. There are so many illogical scenarios in the plot that teaching lessons from them seems ridiculous. In real life, different decisions most assuredly would have had to be make. An admitted killer, who also kills members of the party taking him to the prison train, is not himself dispatched by the remaining members? Dan asks his son to warn him when Ben's gang approaches Contention, but when the gang of 7 is gathered in a group outside the hotel window (and could easily be eliminated), does nothing? These are sworn killers, inexplicably left to kill more. They then enlist the help of the townspeople (for $200 each) to help in killing Ben's captors. Now Ben must be transported to the train station with 30 to 40 gunmen looking to kill whoever is escorting him. When everyone else abandons the effort, Dan still accepts it and, unbelievably, succeeds (with Ben running towards the train rather than trying to escape). Would this really happen in real life? Finally, when Dan is killed, Ben inexplicably kills *all* of his remaining gang. This is the gang who has doggedly pursued him & his captors to eventually free him. Then he willingly climbs aboard the prison train, probably eventually to be hanged. Really? How can Dan's son be expected to learn anything practical from these unrealistic scenarios?",3,1,2,3 October 2016
John Wick," A Complete Waste of Time
","Too bad I had to give this movie a '1' rating. It really deserves a zero. I can't believe at one time it had an 8+. At least now it's on its way down. I enjoy action films, but they should have some sense of reality and character development. John Wick has neither. Gratuitous violence on 100+ (I lost count) bad guys who are seemingly just waiting to be dispatched by John. No attempt at creative engagement of the bad guys. Just show up at a particular location and start shooting. Shoot 20 or more bad guys at a nightclub, on the dance floor, while people keep dancing?? Give me a break. More like a video game than an engrossing, entertaining movie. I kept waiting for my countdown counter to reach zero, which seemed to take forever. An hour and 40 minutes totally wasted. If you're over 15, skip it.",1,11,20,14 November 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Intricate Spy vs. Spy Story That Needs 2 Viewings to Fully Appreciate
","If you like intricate plots, this is a good flick to watch. To catch all the details, though, I recommend watching it twice. Surprising how much more sense the story makes the second time around. The details fit together like a find Swiss watch. To catch all the heavy British accent dialog, consider enabling subtitles.",7,2,2,9 May 2017
The Patriot," B-o-r-i-n-g
","If you want to watch a politically correct retelling of the American revolution, with exaggerated British atrocities, with horrible acting (except for the British villain),then this is the film for you. I'm not an expert on acting, but even to me this was hard to take. I couldn't believe it was rated 7.1 when I viewed it. Women lecturing men on the philosophies of declaring freedom and fighting for it. Blacks accepted as equals and fighting side-by-side in the militia (if you look closely, there's even a black soldier in the *British* regular army's front line at the start of the last battle). The dialog sounded like something from Father Knows Best. 2 hours and 15 minutes of it! Beautiful costumes and scenery, engaging musical score, but overall insulting to your intelligence.",2,3,10,27 May 2017
Snowden," Rather Boring Portrayal of an Important Issue
","Don't try to use this movie to educate yourself about the Edward Snowden story. You're basically getting the director's slanted interpretation. A documentary on him, how he did it, and why would be much better for that purpose. Taken as pure entertainment, I found the movie boring. The only suspense is when he is copying files, might be noticed, and, when done, drops the SD card on the carpet. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal is flat and there's no chemistry between him and Melissa Leo (his girlfriend). Again, watch a documentary to hopefully get a more-balanced portrayal of the Snowden story and look elsewhere for internet hacking entertainment.",3,4,11,10 May 2017
The Departed," Too Complex For Its Own Good
","Plot complexity does not necessarily a good movie make. When a drama's events become so complex that they couldn't happen in real life, it loses its link to reality. First of all, we have two moles who work their way to positions of unquestionable loyalty in their respective organizations in very short periods of time. When bad things start happening, they aren't the first ones sidelined to see if the bad things stop. Incriminating conversations & texts take place on unsecured cell phones that are never wiretapped. The main villain is an FBI informant, known as such to 2-bit punks he extorts money from, but not known as such to the 'cream of the crop' Boston police or State Police units. A real forensics unit would tear Colin's (Matt Damon)final story to shreds. The 'real' mole Barrigan (James Dale) gets shot with his own service revolver -- which has no prints on it. The same gun manages to kill Billy and Trooper Brown before that. How did Barrigan use it and then manage to lose it? That's the only gun that does the final shooting, so it's changing hands but manages to wind up with no fingerprints. Finally, Dingam (Mark Wahlberg) takes the law into his own hands and executes Colin in the final scene. The way he insures he'll get away with it is by wearing protective booties, but not gloves. No one sees him enter or leave, hears the gun, and he doesn't leave any hair strands behind for DNA evidence. At that point Colin is still believed to be a hero and the resulting investigation would be relentless.If you're willing to overlook all these (and more) inconsistencies, the story line is entertaining.",3,2,4,22 May 2017
Platoon," History Distorted
","A distorted telling of the Vietnam war where the US can't do anything right or win any battles. The opposite of 'The Green Berets' which is overly positive. Granted, the portrayed mistakes probably happened. But they happened over 10 years. Not common occurrences and not all to one unit, as implied by the movie. To be expected from Oliver Stone.",4,0,5,7 June 2017
The Nice Guys," Where Are The Laughs?
","When I saw reviews citing this movie as 'hilarious' and 'laugh out loud funny', I had to voice an opinion. Don't expect anything nearly as funny as the 'Airplane' or 'Naked Gun' movies. Or the kind of teamwork chemistry in 'Lethal Weapon'. The script is weak and I actually was going to stop watching in the beginning. I didn't get my first laugh until the middle, and there were only a couple after that. It does get more exciting towards the end with better jokes. However, if this is the kind of dialog & situations you have to put a 13 year-old girl in to gain notoriety in today's movie scene, where have all the quality writers gone?",3,6,11,22 September 2016
