The Ring," Not so much scary as it is psychological
","Let me start off by saying that The Ring isn't as scary as many make it out to be. Yes, it has some moments where you may jump a little bit, but those moments are few and far apart. The movie is mostly psychological, with many freakish moments, for example, the haunted tape. The story is pretty good. It's about a video tape that kills its viewers seven days after they watch it, and a reporter who tries to investigate its mystery after watching it herself. You probably will need to see the movie more than once to fully understand the plot, but when you do, it'll be worth it. I couldn't help but ask, why? I won't ruin the story for you, but after you watch it, you'll be asking the same question. Since this movie is based on the hit Japanese film, Ringu, you might have already seen it, but I doubt that. And it has many differences with the superior Japanese version. All in all, The Ring is a great movie to watch at night time, in a dark room, with few people huddled around the television set. Definitely check this one out.Final Score - 9 / 10",8,0,0,2 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Probably one of the best movies to ever grace the big screen!
","I saw The Matrix Reloaded the first day it came out, then again the second day, and the third, and so on for about one and a half weeks. This movie is that good. If you liked the first Matrix, you'll love Reloaded. The Wachowski brothers have created an excellent movie that will surely live on in the minds of sci-fi fanatics for a long while. The movie starts out with a bang and doesn't stop blowing you away until the end. There is more action here than you can possibly handle in one movie (especially the Neo vs. Smiths fight). The story weaves a magnificent puzzler that'll keep you thinking, just the fashion of the Wachowskis. I don't want to get too much into the plot, but let me just say that it answers a lot of questions that spawned from the first movie, and leaves the same amount, if not more, to be answered in the next installment, due in theaters this November. The special effects are dazzling, setting a new standard that will be hard to beat. Remember how so many movies started to rip off The Matrix after it released? Well, not many movies are going to do that anymore, simply because they just can't, with all the high-cost effects and all. The cast was great, but you couldn't help but feel that the script felt too...well, scripted. It didn't make me feel for the character that much because it sort of gave away that it was just a movie. Anyone looking for a thrill this summer should definitely watch this movie, as it will leave you on the edge of your seat. And now that it's out on IMAX, it's even better!Final Score - 9.75 / 10",10,0,0,1 July 2003
