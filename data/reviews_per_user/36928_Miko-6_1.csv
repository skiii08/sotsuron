The Blair Witch Project," Well...I wasn't scared.
","This film was entertaining but not everything it's been hyped to be. The acting was good, especially if it was on-the-fly. Their fear was real. The film was good at showing exactly what would happen to someone's psyche if those circumstances were repeated. The interaction of the characters was right on. But, it wasn't scary to me! I was so disappointed with that! The final scene is interesting and leaves you guessing but at no time was I convinced of any witch or haunting. Seemed like it could've just been some psycho freak hanging out in the woods. Maybe it's a sign of the times, weird crap like that happens every day now.",Null,0,1,12 August 1999
