Blade Runner 2049," A vehicle for weaponry?
","Admitted, the movie just opened in Denmark, and I'm in doubts whether I should go or not. Explanation: All advertising, posters and trailers for this flick displays guns and bombs from start to ending. As does coming up Fahrenheit 451 (2018)... Why? The N.R.A. of course, which involuntarily makes me an investor in the most morbid and self annihilating business on any known planet. So I'm biased to my eyeballs, because I've seen too much human destruction(in the real world) and my brain screams 'Don't go'.... So - should I stay, or should I go? I'll let you know... But why are we(the movie goers) not putting our feet down, as killings and corrupt war making gets more and more prevalent? Why?",5,6,12,31 October 2017
The Hunger Games," Washed out genre piece...
","Never caught the 'fantasy-fever' - 'Lords Of The Ring', 'Harry Potter' etc. This movie never took off from the fine concept, only to disappoint further as runtime piled up... Ended as it started: A promising concept!

Pacific Rim," Do not watch this on home TV-set...
","Went in to the viewing with overall low expectations, and movie didn't disappoint me! Expected great CGI with mediocre story and acting, and got exactly that. As great visuals demand more than a 51' screen with built-in speakers to carry through on it's own, though, uninvolving acting and predictable plot just dragged overall viewing experience all down. My recommendation is therefore to watch 'Pacific Rim' in the movie theater where the audio-visuals comes to their rights, and leaves you with the final impression. In any case: Leave your brains in the wardrobe... Del Toro had full control on both writing and directing 'El laberinto del fauno'(Pans Labyrinth), and made a masterpiece. Hopefully upcoming 'Pinocchio' will pay tribute to his ability to make art when both writing and directing. Till then, 'Iron Man' ticks all the right boxes, and leaves this rip-off in (and together with) Oblivion. CGI= 7 Contence= 2 Viewing experience on home TV= 3 Overall= 4",4,4,7,29 November 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Half sci-fi plus half romance does not equal a whole movie.
","I expected a high credibility movie on Mr. Damon's name alone, but only got a copy-paste no-brainer of a genre mix. As with 'Shutter Island' it doesn't move me emotionally or intellectually- it just tries too hard to be intriguing by mixing genres.Even trying to make the poster resemble that of 'North By North West' doesn't recreate the unique thriller movie romance between Grant and Eva Marie Saint, neither makes Nolfi Hitchcock. And where Nolfi's idle running 'The Sentinel' (2006) is carried through by solid acting(Douglas, Sutherland) as a more classic genre piece, Bourne, oops, correction, Damon and Blunt has not a quality mixed genre screenplay to work with.Now, only 'Code 46'(2003, Winterbottom) or 'Blade Runner'(1982, R. Scott) can now erase my memory of a bad executed sci-fi romance. Even 'Minority Report'(2002, Spielberg) could do that, replacing romance with a level of development of Mr. Cruise's character.2 for the sci-fi, 4 for the romance, 3 for the screenplay 9/11Truth- ask questions",3,1,2,25 May 2012
The Good Shepherd," Nothing for your brains to work with...
","Yet another Hollywood 'historic' movie to make good Americans feel educated on war... Admitted, I only lasted an hour or so, but the Hollywood dramaturgi with E V E R Y dialog meant to shove it down your throat and leave nothing to your own precious imagination, makes me sick .. Stop it, Hollywood, its getting embarrassing to watch! Cartoonish and almost resembling the cinematography of the silent movies of Keaton or Chaplin... And WHY, Matt, just WHY? Didn't you read the script or are you just another good school boy? Pathetic... I give it 5 out of 10 on leaving me indifferent and seriously underwhelmed. America needs an age of enlightment, so Go Bernie... â˜º",Null,2,8,16 May 2016
