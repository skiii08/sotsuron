Iron Man 3," A Disappointment - Wait for the DVD
","Shane Black has done to Iron Man what Bret Ratner did to X-Men. I went to the cinema looking forward to see Ben Kingsley play a ruthless Mandarin. Instead, it all turns out to be a joke, and the Mandarin, Iron-man's arch-nemesis turns out to non-existent. So much for all the hype in the trailers. The writers probably thought they were smart in putting such a drastic plot-twist, but instead I left the cinema feeling deceived and disappointed. As someone already mentioned, they should just have just stuck to the established storyline.If that wasn't enough, there were a host of other things wrong with this movie. The one-liners got painfully annoying. Loud explosions are expected to compensate for half-thought out action scenes. The plot was half-baked at best with a lot of holes. First AIM is selling Extremis to the Mandarin, then it turns out he wants to create supply and demand to sell it to the government, and next he's killing the president and 'moving on'. As many others have mentioned, then Iron Man who was able to withstand Thor and his lightening melts in 3000c heat. Warmachine gets disabled because a woman touched his hand. The iron suit, which is supposed to be powered by the arc reactor, a limitless power supply, needs to be charged like your iPhone.The only part I liked about the movie was the slideshow at the credits.",1,102,206,26 April 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Seems like the director took his hands off the wheel...
","It seems that nowadays directors are trying to out-do each other with the most number of unbelievable action scenes and unnecessary plot-twists. It's like the 80s all over again. Fast and Furious is transitioning into Die Hard. The good part is that it was enjoyable, with a lot of good comedy. The rest though, left something to be desired. Reviewers Carl-Walster and Justin Curtis do a great job of pointing out everything that's wrong with the movie. Apart from what they've said already, why would a supposedly calculating criminal mastermind like Shaw suddenly go on a murderous rampage crushing innocent people on a highway? Somewhere late into the movie they had decided that they needed another plot-twist, and turned Gina Carano's character, who was a good cop throughout the whole movie, into a dirty cop at the last minute. While this movie packs excitement and is still a fun night out, it's a disappointment for F&F fans. All in all I wish Rob Cohen would come back to this franchise and take it back to the roots.Looking forward to the sequel with Jason Statham. But that's from a horror movie director, so I'm not having high expectations.",5,1,3,10 June 2013
A Quiet Place," Why does this have such a high rating?
",Too many glaring plot-holes. Expected more from a movie with Emily Blunt.,1,1,3,12 August 2018
