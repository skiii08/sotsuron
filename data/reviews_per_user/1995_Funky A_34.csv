Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A hhhhhhhuuuuuuuuuggggggggggeeeeeeeee disappointment
","I AM A STAR WARS FAN. I had high expectations for this movie, really high expectations. Ever since I saw the original Star Wars trilogy, I have been dreaming for a sequel(or a prequel, or whatever). I never tough the day would come where I would see proofs that there would be a new Star Wars but I kept hoping for it. One day, I saw the words 'Episode 1 casting announced' on the cover of my Star Wars Insider! It was an incredibly good moment for me. You should have seen entering the movie theatre on May 19, 1999... I was out of control! I came in there believing I would be blown away... I came out of there really, really, really disappointed. God knows I tried to like that movie(I have seen it 4 times!), but every time time I came out of the theater, I felt disappointed. Okay, now lets get to the qualities and problems of this Star Wars. Let's start with the good...First of all it's a Star Wars(although sometimes I ask myself if it really is). The movie is beautiful from a visual point of view. The special effects are great and some action scenes, like the podrace and the Jedi combats, are great. I would even say that some of the characters were okay, like Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. The music is great(thank you, John Williams). Now let's see the problems... Here we go! First thing, let's just say that Jar-Jar Binks is horrible. He is so annoying and every last one of his line is absolutely ridiculous and useless. Some characters were poorly introduced: R2-D2, C-3PO, Jar-Jar and... Anakin! This boy is the whole point of the movie and he is poorly introduced! Jake Lloyd really has a terrible character to play and he doesn't help it! Anakin is so annoying as the 'little boy that wins by accident and luck and never needs to do anything to be the best' that most of his scenes are boring, particularly in scenes with his mother. These scenes are absolutely unbelievably fake. Talking about the 'point of this movie', it almost has none. It's an introduction to universe we already know! It almost feels like a movie for people who have never seen Star Wars!Let me tell you one thing, not many people fall in that category. The plot looks like the one of the weakest episode in the original  trilogy: Return of the Jedi. Talking about Return, those stupid Gungans are even worse than the Ewoks!!! 60%, just because it is a Star Wars. See you in line for Episode 2, hoping it will be better!",6,0,1,12 January 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best adventure movie ever!(Star Wars is NOT an adventure movie)
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is great! I know its not very original to say that but you know, it's true! This an adventure you have to go on, if you haven't already  I will try to explain why. First of all, Harrison Ford is perfect for this role. Also, it is full of action.  It is simple and unbelievable but never stupid. And the scenario is good. Sure, it's not like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest's fascinating observation of mental problems but IT'S AN ADVENTURE MOVIE! And if adventure is what you like, you will get what you want! It's true that if adventure has a name, it's Indiana Jones! Don't accept any rip-off, take only the original (or maybe one of the sequels, since they are not as good, but still very good). 10 out of 10. Great, for an action movie. Okay, just great.",10,0,0,20 January 2000
As Good as It Gets," Great acting and great writing...
","As Good as it Gets is a very funny movie, filled with great acting and lines that always hit the mark p-e-r-f-e-c-t-l-y... Jack Nicholson is absolutely perfect, and Helen Hunt proves that she can do better than playing in Twister... Greg Kinnear is also very convincing in his role. The Oscar-cursed Cuba Gooding Jr. gives one of his last good performances, if not THE last one... Great movie...

Batman Returns," As good as the first one... maybe better...I don't know...
","I loved the first Batman movie(in my review of it I said a big 9 out 10... silly am I... IT'S A BIG TEN!). Batman Returns is a visually stunning film. Its features some of the most wonderful settings in movie history, I am not kidding! The penguin's hideout is incredible and Gotham is even more impressive than in the first movie. Christopher Walken is very good in is role. Once again, Tim Burton created a fantastic setting in which a great story can take place.And it does. The story is a typical comic book story that sticks very well to the Batman character. Even tough I didn't like the Penguin-Catwoman as much as the Joker, I don't know which Batman I liked the most. This calls for repeated viewings. A big ten!!!!!",10,1,2,10 January 2000
Ed Wood," A excellent film
","Tim Burton once again captured my heart! This movie is fantastic! The acting is absolutely fantastic! Martin Landau is incredible as Bela Lugosi and Johnny Depp is great as Edward D. Wood Jr. While not as impressive as other movies from Burton from a visual point of view, it is still a visually charming movie. I believe it was a very good idea to do this movie in black and white. It is funny AND touching... You laugh and you are moved by this movie which tells the story of the man who was declared the worst director of all time. A great supporting cast and a wonderful script make this movie a must-see.10 out of 10",10,4,5,13 January 2000
Sleepy Hollow," One of the best films of 1999
","Sleepy Hollow combines having fun and seeing a intelligent film. After all, it's a Tim Burton film. It is really a beautiful film(every image looks like a painting). Also, It is wonderfully acted(Johnny Depp is excellent). The story, although simple, is still very well written. I think that this movie almost has it all. The only problem might be in the ending. It is not bad, but you want to know more. This is a feeling that I get after seeing almost every Tim Burton film. Maybe it's because I love them sssooo much. If you have read my Batman reviews, you may have a feeling of déjà-vu in the following lines. This director made the most stylish movies of this decade. As opposed to most commercially successful directors, he really has a style of his own. I really love his movies. If you want to see an entertaining but intelligent film, this might be what you are looking for...       94%",9,0,0,13 January 2000
Snatch," Excellent entertainment with a lot of style.
","Snatch is an excellent action movie with a lot of style. First of all, the cast is excellent, the best being Brad Pitt, which is impressive as 'One Punch' Mickey O'Neil. The story is simple but told in a way to make it a bit confusing, a bit like Pulp Fiction did. It's not revolutionnary but it is very good. The characters are awesome. But the biggest reason why this film is not just another action movie is Guy Ritchie's stylish directing. His style reminds me a bit of Danny Boyle, one of my favorite directors, but he uses more slow-motions and it is clear that he has done music videos. But while some directors don't know how to use this influence to make a movie instead of a 2 hours long music video(for example, the incompetent who directed the awful Charlie's Angels), Ritchie uses strange camera angles and effects to give style to his story and create images which are hard to forget. Snatch will neither change the way you look at movies nor will it tell you anything about the meaning of life, but you will have a great time and you will not forget some of the images for a long time(I won't tell you which ones because I would give away the story). Anyway, I highly recommend it and after a year of so-so movies with a few exceptions, it is fun to see a really good one.81%",8,0,0,29 January 2001
The Beach," Good movie, but Boyle's weakest.
","The Beach is a good movie but it could have been better. The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise. And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing. It was made by the usual Danny Boyle-John Hodge team, but someone is missing: Ewan McGregor. McGregor would have been perfect as Richard, but instead, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who got the role. While DiCaprio is not a bad actor, he is not a good one either. He can't ruin a movie by himself, but he can't make it better. He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma. And that lack of charisma is made even more evident in the scenes between him and Robert Carlyle, which gives an awesome performance in a small role. When both actors are on screen, DiCaprio disappears. Virginie Ledoyen was chosen because she is absolutely gorgeous, not because of her acting talent. Her performance as FranÃ§oise is barely okay. The rest of the cast is good. Tilda Swinton shows the obsession of her character very well. There is, as in any Boyle movie, an excellent soundtrack which includes such artists as Moby, Blur, The Chemical Brothers, UNKLE, Asian Dub Foundation, Underworld and New Order. Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet). The photography is Oscar-worthy. As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one. Also, the love story is not very well done and too predictable. But despite some flaws, this is still an interesting movie. I also believe it is better to have already seen Shallow Grave before seeing this one, as it tackles similar themes shown in a very different way. It is fun to see how Boyle includes them in is most commercial movie yet(and hopefully, ever).77%",8,0,0,7 August 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Surprisingly good.
","The fact that I loved Moulin Rouge convinced me to see Romeo + Juliet, Baz Luhrmann's previous movie but I was a bit worried. First of all, Romeo and Juliet has never been my favorite Shakespeare tragedy. And the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio had the role of Romeo did not convince me either. He is not a terrible actor, but he is certainly not a great one. Well, luckily Luhrmann's name convinced me to see this very good version of the classic play. His directing is impressive. The actors also do a great job. Danes and Dicaprio are a great couple, and John Leguizamo is perfect as Tybalt. His performance convinced me, along with his role in the incredible Summer of Sam, that Leguizamo is an excellent actor, someone with the potential to be remembered as one of the great actors of his generation. The rest of the cast is also very good. Sure, there might be a bit too much screaming from time to time but the energy with which Luhrmann films everything makes it seem normal. As for the story, it is told with enough passion to make me forget about everything I dont like about it. All in all, this movie is worth your time, although if you are in the mood for Shakespeare at his best, watch Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version of Hamlet. But if you dont have time for this wonderful 4 hour epic, Romeo + Juliet is a dynamic version of a classic story.78%",8,0,0,30 December 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Even better than the first one...
","The Godfather was incredibly good... but the sequel is even better!!! The idea of having the movie divided in two stories(The leadership of Don Michael and the rise of young Vito) is absolutely wonderful... and never slowed down the story. The acting is as superb as in the original Godfather, but the characters are even more interesting in this movie... If you haven't seen this movie or the first one, you are missing something incredible... A must-see...102%... EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!",10,0,0,3 April 2000
Cast Away," Good movie with a bad ending and a little too much Fed-Ex publicity...
","Cast Away is a movie that could have been very boring because of its unoriginal subject, but which is very good. Hanks, playing his usual nice American role which he does so well, gives a good performance, although it probably wasn't hard to do so since this role ressembles a lot of the ones he has had in the last years. The rest of the cast is not very important. The movie starts off well, and the plane crash is simply terrifying and shows how well Zemeckis can direct. The part on the island is very entertaining and you take pleasure watching Hanks learning to live in nature. The idea of making this part an almost silent movie is very good and I loved the concept of Wilson(I won't tell you what it is but I will tell you it is GOOD). What was bad was the fact that this movie has a truly unsatisfying ending, nothing really original to offer and Fed-Ex logos everywhere... But it is still intelligent entertainment.74%",7,0,0,29 January 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A really good Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.
","I am not usually the kind of person who likes an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but Terminator 2 is very entertaining. First of all, there is a plot and it is not bad. We are not talking about the best plot ever seen in a movie, but Terminator 2 has a storyline that touches many classic Science-Fiction themes like time-travel and the war between machine and man in interesting ways. Also, Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as a robot. You know, he has never been the kind of actor who can show a great range of subtle emotions but the part of a robot is perfect for him. He is a killing machine, and he looks STRONG. And when John Connor tells him to never kill humans, the way he 'handles' the order is really good. But even more impressive than the Terminator himself is T-1000. I mean, few movie vilains are as dangerous as he is, and few survive as many harsh treatments has he does. And this is where the incredible special effects come play a role in the quality of this movie. These effects are creative and still credible after more than 10 years. Sometimes, computer-generated special effects do not age very well but those in Terminator 2 are still impressive today. This is an accomplishment. Linda Hamilton is not the most convincing actress ever and it is no different in T2 but she doesn't ruin the movie. Some of the things the script makes her say are really stupid but she is not the most important character in the movie. T2 is about those two robots from the future and they don't dissapoint. The action scenes are good and on the whole, the movie is a really entertaining big-budget blockbuster. And as a bonus, it has a better story than your average action movie.79%",8,0,0,3 February 2002
Spider-Man," With the rights to a great franchise comes great responsibilities... and Raimi is up to the job!
","I always loved comic book super-heroes, like the X-Men, Batman, Superman and, of course, Spider-Man. So the fact that so many Marvel movies are going to be released is great news for me. After the very good but a bit disappointing X-Men, I couldn't wait to see what Sam Raimi would do with Spider-Man. And I must say the overdose of CGI that was the preview of this movie made me fear for the worst, and I didn't see Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. But what Sam Raimi delivers is an excellent super-hero movie that will also entertain regular moviegoers! Raimi's love of the main character is undeniable and he approches the Webslinger with the light entertaining touch required, dosing funny moments and action scenes perfectly while not forgeting to devellop the storyline, which the movie does very well, dealing with the origins of Spider-Man in a way that wont bore anyone, even those who came to see loads of nonstop action and can't wait for something to blow up... He also deals with the death of important characters very well. But the two biggest surprises came from Tobey Maguire and the special effects. Maguire was perfect in his role and the special effects were not an overdose of high-budget but cheap-looking CGI we have been getting recently. It seems some people think that if it is CGI, people can only think it looks good, although some creatures in movies like The Lord of the Rings weren't very convincing. Well, in Spider-Man, the job is well-done. Of course, Willem Dafoe was amazing as the Green Goblin... But can Willem Dafoe be anything else but great? JK Simmons is the J. Jonah Jameson everyone wanted and as anyone who loved the Evil Dead movies, I was pleased to see Bruce Campbell! Kirsten Dunst was cute and that is the only thing she had to do and the rest of the cast was good. Now, of course, the movie wasn't perfect and some of the dialogue was cheesy. But apart from the dialogue, Spider-Man is everything it had to be: an incredibly entertaining movie that will please people who love comic books and people who just want to see a good summer movie, with great characters (although the Green Goblin ain't the best Spidey villain ever and I will be more than happy to see a Venom/Carnage or Mysterio movie) and a good introduction to what is sure to become a very popular franchise.84%",8,0,0,15 May 2002
Dark City," Great potential ruined...
","This movie looked so good... It's hard to believe someone could turn such a great idea into a pointless movie. The mood is very well set, the actors are good and some of the philosophical subjects are very interesting indeed, but the movie ends up being a weak science-fiction thriller with absolutely no twists nor any turns... The actions sequences are so bad and boring, it's hard to stay awake and the dialogues are often bad. The mood is well set, as I said earlier, but it's useless when the story is so boring. I don't like Alex Proyas(the director) because he makes movies that seem inspired by Tim Burton, but never have the fun factor of Burton's movies. He had very interesting ideas, but he made nothing to support them, just a nice-looking city, dark enough to make me remember the Gotham City Burton made. I don't hate this movie, I just think it could have been so much more. It had everything to make it a sci-fi classic like 2001, A Space Odyssey, but instead, it will be probably be remembered as a near-stroke-of-genius that could have been incredible... It is sad to think so many good ideas were wasted in that movie that finally goes to an ending that seems a bit rushed...6 out of 10... Too bad...",6,1,2,21 February 2000
Man on the Moon," A very good film on an interesting man
","Man on the Moon was an excellent movie. Jim Carrey plays in a second great movie in a row(The Truman Show being the first of those). Is performance is very impressive. He is a very good Kauffman. He looks and acts like the real thing. The movie is a good way to discover Andy Kauffman, a fascinating character. This movie is funny and touching at the same time. In that way, it resembles Tim Burton's Ed Wood. It is not as great as Ed Wood... but still, it is one of 1999 best movies(along with Sleepy Hollow). And if, like me, you love R.E.M., you in for a musical treat...10 out of 10...SEE IT!!!",10,0,0,17 January 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," An epic classic
","Do you want to see a good movie this week? If you said yes, why don't you pick up a copy of Lawrence of Arabia at your local video store. Why? Because it's a wonderful movie with a great story, superb images of the desert and great acting. It's a movie that follows the fascinating story of an interesting character:T.E. Lawrence a.k.a Lawrence of Arabia. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence a I don't think they could have chosen a better actor for this role. He is great. Alec Guiness is as good as ever and the overall distribution is impressive. You will also see the acting debut of Omar Sharif. You are not convinced yet!? I will simply remind you it won the Oscar for best movie in 1962...An easy 10 for this classic.",10,0,2,10 January 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Something has survived...and it's a bad thing!
","This has nothing to do with the excellent Michael Crichton sequel to Jurassic Park. This movie is bad to the last drop. It's a boring dinosaur movie with all the problems of a sequel. The story is uninteresting, to say the least, and is nothing more than cheap excuse to put people on an island full of hungry dinosaurs. All those hunters have the words 'EAT-ME' printed on their forehead. Malcom's daugther could win the prize for most annoying character ever and the others are not much better. You just hope they all get eaten so you can just get out of the stupid island but no... they had to put a T-Rex in the city! This part of the movie is simply TOO boring. Your watching your watch and are asking yourself 'how long can it be before they catch that stupid T-Rex!?'. They only 'quality' bad sequels have is that they are short, so you don't suffer very long, but this movie is painfully long(134 min)! The only thing this movie does right are the special effects. But how long can you watch dinosaurs run everywhere, no matter how beautiful they are? I can't repeat it too often: this movie is terrible!3 out of 10. A bad sequel.",3,0,8,2 February 2000
Moulin Rouge!," A Spectacular Musical!
","Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! achieves what few musicals have done in my life: wait for the next song! Usually, I feel that the songs in musicals halt the story, and become boring when the chorus is said for the fifth time... But it is not the same thing with Moulin Rouge!. First of all, the collection of popular songs that have been used to create the songs from Moulin Rouge! have the word 'variety' written all over them. Lady Marmalade meets Smells Like Teen Spirits! The Police, The Beatles, Nirvana, Madonna... The list of bands and artists goes on and on... And everything is really well done! Even better, the story is being told by the songs instead of simply being repeated... But even better than the music is the visual style of the movie. If Luhrmann's camera moved too fast for you in Romeo and Juliet, don't even think about watching Moulin Rouge! without getting a headache. Everything feels larger than life, everything is moving. Beautiful colors invade the screen. This movie is a visual treat. Even better: the acting is actually quite good. Ewan McGregor, an actor I really like, is great and is on screen chemistry with Nicole Kidman is impressive. They are a great couple. And Kidman is beautiful, even more so than she usually is, which says a lot. This only makes it more credible that every man dreams of her. As a movie couple, Christian and Satine are fantastic. Luhrmann might be behind this, as Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were another great on-screen couple in his previous movie. And John Leguizamo is impressive in the relatively small part of Toulouse-Lautrec. And lets not forget Jim Broadbent, as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge!, another great addition to the cast. The most sursprising thing about Moulin Rouge!, though, might be the fact that the cliché story is actually quite touching. Basically, this could have been called 'Romeo and Juliet Go To The Moulin Rouge', but everyone takes the classic storyline to life with such passion, and the characters are so effective that you dont mind the fact that you have been told a similar story quite a few times. From the beginning of the movie, Christian says that the story will end sadly, but you nevertheless keep hoping... Basically, this love story is much better than 1997's 'Romeo and Juliet Are On A Boat', also known as Titanic. So the music is great, the acting is great, the story is involving and the movie is visually stunning. What more can you ask?87%",9,0,1,30 January 2002
Pi," I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E...
","Pi is an incredible movie that you probably will want to see more than once. It is what an indie film should be. It is intelligent, thought-provoking and it does not use one of the formulas Hollywood has been repeatedly using in the last decades. The soundtrack, mostly composed of electronic music, is incredibly good and works perfectly with what you are seeing on the screen. And what you see on the screen is even better than the soundtrack! The black and white photography is in harmony with the paranoid, schizophrenic, claustrophobic mood of the movie. Sean Gullette is great as Maximillian Cohen and the rest of the cast is very good. Words cannot describe this movie. Only seeing it will make you understand how good it is.91%",9,1,3,4 August 2000
The Insider," One of the best movies of 1999...
","Along with American Beauty, Man on the Moon, Sleepy Hollow and The Talented Mr. Ripley, this is one of the best movies of the year... The Insider has many qualities: Excellent acting by Pacino, Crowe, Plummer and most of the supporting cast(with the exception of Diane Verona, which I didn't find very convincing as Wigand's wife), an excellent theme, excellent directing by Mann and an excellent score by Pieter Bourke, Lisa Gerrard and Graeme Revell. The movie was neither too long nor too short. I never felt something like 'We get it, now another scene please!'. As I said earlier, the cast is almost perfect and only Diane Verona sometimes could be better. But most of the time, she is good and her acting is rarely a problem. Overall, I really loved this movie. 85%",9,0,0,28 May 2000
Annie Hall," Probably the best movie by one of the best directors in history.
","I love most of Woody Allen's movies, but this one is probably my favourite. This film portrays relationships in a very intelligent and funny way. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are both exceptional in their role.  The jokes are mostly verbal. I could go on and on about how great this movie is, but the only thing you should do is stop reading this critic and go see Annie Hall.10 out of 10, in case you had not already figured out...",10,2,4,23 February 2000
The Untouchables," Great cast, great directing, great score, great movie!
","Brian De Palma is a great director and this is one of his best movies. The Untouchables has everything a good gangster movie should have. This starts with a great cast: Kevin Costner is good as Elliot Ness, but surprisingly, the rest of the cast is even better. Connery is excellent, as always, and DeNiro is very convincing a Al Capone. Andy Garcia, an actor which hasn't played in a good movie for a while is perfect for his 'tough new cop' role. But two of the best actors in the movie, right behind Connery, are actors I had never heard of: Billy Drago, which is absolutely perfect as Frank Nitti, giving him a cold, and Charles Martin Smith is well cast as Oscar Wallace. Ennio Morricone's score is incredible... And David Mamet's script is very good. But what steals the show is certainly Brian De Palma's directing and Stephen H. Burum's cinematography. This movie is full of suspense, great action scenes and an involving story which never loses steam. This is a very entertaining and well-done movie.84%",8,0,0,5 January 2001
Army of Darkness," Evil Dead 2 was better, but this one is also very good.
","The third installment in the Evil Dead trilogy, this movie is not as good as the second one but is still very, very very funny. The special effects are fantastically bad, but that makes it even funnier. Some moments are so stupid and illogical, you will be laughing so hard your belly will hurt. Some of these moments include when Ash(the hero) uses a shotgun almost like an automatic riffle, when his medieval girlfriend(her name is SHEILA, which I don't think existed during that era...) is captured by a flying monster, which looks like what it is: an actor in a cheap costume. Also, Ash speaks only in one-liners. Examples: 'Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun...', and the classic ' Take that, you She-Bitch'. Overall, this movie is an horror/comedy that focuses much less on the horror part than Evil Dead 2. It's VERY funny, and also much better than recent rip-offs which targeted the teen audience like Idle Hand.7 out of 10. The second one is better but this one is also very good.",7,1,1,21 February 2000
Scream 2," This movie says that sequels suck and proves it!
","I did not have high expectations for this sequel of the overrated Scream, and I didn't get much. What I got was a good discussion about sequels, appearances by Randy and Dewey(the only characters I liked in Scream) and a pointless slasher with an even weaker story than the first one. I didn't like the characters in the first Scream. They annoyed me. Well, the characters in this one are replacements for the victims of the first movie and survivors of Scream. So I hated the characters in this one as well. It is even less frightening than the first one!!! The fresh side of the first one is not there anymore(the movie is almost identical to the original Scream). You know the scenes before you have seen them, since they are the same as the original Scream, and when I say same, I really mean SAME. But as they say in this movie, sequels suck... The killer(or maybe... killerS...) was logical in the first one but this time, it's so stupid(------ SPOILER WARNING: I mean, come on, they introduce a character that you knew nothing about at the end and say it's one of the killers... This makes it impossible to get that 'How could HE do that' feeling. And another thing, maybe I found this one even weaker than the first one because they killed the best character, Randy. Randy was the best character and they KILLED HIM!------END OF SPOILER---------- Anyway, Scream 2 is even weaker than the first one in my opinion. Still, it's an above-average slasher, much better than craps like Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and all the other 'sons of Scream'. But, again, that doesn't make it a good movie.

Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the two best vampire movies of all time...
","With a beautiful cinematography, Coppola's awesome directing and incredible performances by Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Waits, in a short but still incredible role, Dracula is one of my two favorite vampire movies of all time, along with Interview with The Vampire. This movie is one of the best looking of all times, although it doesn't quite reach Sleepy Hollow, the best looking movie in history. Costumes, make-up and cinematography all help to create the gorgeous look of the movie. The story is beautiful, although you can't really go wrong with a fairly faithful adaptation of Bram Stroker's classic. The one thing which bugs me is Keannu Reeves, which proves how untalented he is, without ruining the movie. I mean, you have to pity the guy for being such a lame actor in such an incredible cast. Anyway, the important thing is that this movie is a fascinating adaptation of the classic vampire story and should be seen by everyone who shows interest in good-looking movies with a great cast and a wonderful story. What more can I say? Now see it!90%",9,1,2,13 August 2001
The Green Mile," Very good, but overrated...
","Even tough The Green Mile is a very good movie, I don't think it should be that high in the IMDb top 250 movies, maybe it shouldn't even be in it. True, some movies are even more unworthy of a place on the top 250(Unforgiven and Deliverance, for example) in my humble opinion, but still, even tough The Green Mile, I repeat it, is a very good movie, it should not be considered one of the best movies ever. That said, let's go to my review. The Green Mile is a very nice movie, with good acting, very satisfying character development and a solid story. It is a really good movie, no doubt about that, but it isn't very original. Looks a lot like Shawshank Redemption. But it is not as good. It is long but you don't feel the hours pass by. No problem there. The biggest problem with this movie is that while it as not many problems, it is not an exceptional movie. Just a very good one. And I think that the 48th place on the top 250 is a place for exceptional movies, not very good ones... Anyway, this movie is still very good and I highly recommend it.79%",8,0,2,7 June 2000
Scream," A good slasher, but still a bad movie...
","I think slashers are boring. They are neither funny, nor frightening, but this one is almost an exception to this rule. Why 'almost'? Because its not frightening. It's funny, mainly because of Randy. Randy and Dewey are the only characters that I didn't hate in this movie. Randy is funny and Dewey is pretty friendly. The others are all jerks that you hope will get killed in the most horrible way and never be heard of anymore, and that INCLUDES Neve Campbell. I have to admit it's hard to like a movie when you hate the hero. But the most annoying character is the one played by Rose McGowan. She is incredibly stupid. A real walking stereotype. The kind of character I absolutely hate. So, it's even harder to love a movie when you hate both the hero and her best friend... Annoying characters are bad in slasher, since you are supposed to like the characters being hunted down and fear for them, not hope they get killed, chopped down in pieces and die in the most horrible way you can imagine. Well, that is the way I felt during the whole movie, except when Dewey and Randy were in trouble. Some jokes about the 'rules' when you are in a slasher are funny(and pretty realistic). But, I never screamed... It's not frightening! THIS IS NOT AN HORROR MOVIE!!! THIS IS A SLASHER!!! Horror movies leave a strange feeling, gives you the creep, have a lasting effect. Slashers go for cheap surprises(killer coming out of the closet, jumping from the roof, etc...). Maybe Scream is, in a way, an horror comedy, since it makes fun of slashers. But if it is, then it could never compete with the kings of horror comedies: Dead Alive(a.k.a. Braindead) and Evil Dead 2. So let's just say it is the king of cheap teen slashers. It is the best of the collection of bad movies that can be found in this category, but that doesn't make it a good movie. It's also better than the horrible sequels that followed, or any of the movies that where 'inspired' by its success. If you love slashers, you will probably love this movie. One last thing: I guessed who the killer was in no time.5 out of 10. A good slasher, but that doesn't make it a good movie...",5,1,3,17 February 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," Great acting make this a great thriller
","In the surprisingly small screen time Anthony Hopkins has in The Silence of the Lambs, he has been able to make an intense character and gives one of the most incredible performances in movie history. Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character and Hopkins is marvelously mad as this maniac. His performance is nothing short of brilliant. Jodie Foster too is very good as Clarisse Starling. She is very believable as a young FBI agent who has to be against a mastermind such as Lecter. The scenes between her and Hannibal are spectacular. Actually, the story between her and Lecter make Buffalo Bill's part of the movie seem weaker than it really is. When you have such great scenes and have to live through good ones, you just hope the greatness will come back... And when Hannibal is back, so is greatness. The script in these scenes is just fantastic. They make an otherwise good movie excellent. The story in The Silence of The Lambs is very well written. As for the directing, Demme overuses the zooming in in some less important scenes a bit but his directing is still very effective and even excellent in some scenes. One near the end is seen through the eyes of Bill and is very well done(which is a good thing in a thriller). Because of the marvellous job done by the actors, Anthony Hopkins becoming one of the most frightening men in the history of movies, very good script and good directing, this movie is an excellent thriller that I highly recommend.85%",9,0,0,6 March 2001
Trainspotting," Another exceptional Danny Boyle movie!
","Danny Boyle has made some of the best movies of the 90's with great movies like Shallow Grave, A Life Less Ordinary and this one. Trainspotting is a movie about drugs and drug-users. This is a difficult subject, mostly because it's hard to talk about it without moralizing, but this movie achieves it with class. First of all, Ewan McGregor is excellent as Rent-Boy. But the rest of the cast also shines. Robert Carlyle is great as the deranged Begbie, Jonny Lee Miller, an actor which I had never heard of before, is excellent as Sick-Boy and Ewan Bremner(another actor I had never heard of before) is perfect for the role of Spuds. And let's not forget Kevin McKidd(yet another actor I had never heard from) which gives a very sensible performance as Tommy. The dialogue is always believable(although I lost a little bit of it when I first head Begbie's accent). The movie has found the perfect balance between harsh realism and fantasy, but also the perfect balance between drama and comedy. Because, even if this movie could have been a potential downer, it is not one. It takes it subject seriously, but at the same time, who could find a movie where a man plunges into a toilet and finds himself swimming in it can be absolutely depressing? Boyle's directing is a pure pleasure, creative and dynamic, but it never goes into MTV territories, which many less talented directors would have been to with this subject and such an... amazing soundtrack. Yes, even the soundtrack is excellent(which is not really a surprise, since this is a Danny Boyle movie) and includes music by Underworld, Iggy Pop, Blur and many others. One of the few problems this movie has is that I find that it doesn't talk enough about Renton's relationship with Diane. Apart from that it's a twisted, well-acted, intelligent, sensible and at the same time energizing movie. I highly recommend it(along with Shallow Grave and A Life Less Ordinary).89%",9,0,0,12 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best of the bests(except for The Empire Strikes Back!)
","Star Wars is a masterpiece. No science-fiction movie(except for its own sequel, The Empire Strikes Back) has the power of Star Wars. It is well written, funny, action-packed, intelligent,well... it is everything! Name a quality, Star Wars probably has it. It features the legendary special effects that this serie is well known for... but it has more(unlike the disappointing Phantom Menace). It is packed with fantastic characters that are impossible to forget. The story is perfectly developed and the dialogue is always good(unlike most actions/science-fiction movies). In fact, why am I talking to you about this movie? You have almost certainly seen it(probably a couple of times) and if you don't agree with me, you probably don't care about my opinion. I am movie fan, but I am also a Star Wars fan. 10 out of 10 is too low for this one! It is a fantastic voyage and if you haven't seen it already, you should stop reading this and run to your video store!",10,0,0,11 January 2000
Gladiator," Great entertainment!!!
","While this movie is not the best Ridley Scott movie ever, Blade Runner is, it is an excellent way to be entertained. It is a fun summer movie that isn't stupid!!! As opposed to most blockbusters from the summer season, this movie has a plot! And not a bad one. Granted, it is not highly original, and it certainly isn't exceptional, but it is very appropriate  for the movie. Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, is very simple, but Crowe has the power to make you care about him, and believe in what he believes. A very good hero indeed. Joaquin Phoenix is satisfying as Commodus, but he relies too heavily on the same techniques to make you feel how is character feels. But he makes you hate Commodus and, that is his role in the movie: the bad guy. He does it well but not incredibly well. Connie Nielsen is good as Lucinda. So, the cast is good, particularly Crowe as the hero. Ridley Scott's directing is perfect. The confusion of the arena is well portrayed, and you see very well how horrible this place was. The sets are incredible, and you can't say what is real and what is CGI. The action sequences are thrilling. As I said earlier, the story isn't too deep or original but it works. Gladiator is a really entertaining movie with a satisfying story.84%",8,0,0,3 June 2000
Evil Dead II," GREAT HORROR COMEDY!!!
","This movie, like Dead Alive(a.k.a. Braindead) is absolutely hilarious! Some moments are pure gems, like when Ash replaces his hand by a chain-saw, and says: Groovy! You have to laugh. This movie has a very good mix of gore and comedy, but is still not as gory as the absolute king of gore: Dead Alive. Very funny moments are always there to make you remember this is an horror/COMEDY film. Watch it with your friends and you will have lots of fun. THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS DEAD ALIVE!!! I know my brain does not work real hard during this movie but TOO BAD! It's a great movie to watch with your friends, and it's even better when you watch it along with Dead Alive.Anyway, 8 out of 10. Really funny. Don't take this movie too seriously, tough...",8,0,0,16 February 2000
High Fidelity," Top 5 movies about relationships? Number one would be this one...
","No matter how you look at it, High Fidelity is an incredible movie. If you want an hilarious comedy, this one more than does the job. If you want a great movie about love and relationships, High Fidelity is the movie to see. And if you just want to see if you are a true music geek this is the best test ever since if, like me, you really relate to Rob's (John Cusack, excellent in his role) Guide to making a good compilation tape, you are definately a music geek. So this movie is just great, but why. The dialogue is hilarious, all the actors are perfect and, well, the whole movie is a delicious examination of love and relationships AND an awesome comedy. The humor is varied, the characters are great and... Simply put, if you are one of those people who like music and movies, this one is for you. It's as simple as that!91%",9,0,1,5 August 2002
The Godfather," Incredible is an understatement...
","The Godfather is an absolutely fantastic movie. There is nothing I can say that is negative about this masterpiece. The acting is more than perfect... Al Pacino gives an amazing performance, one of the best in movie history. I can't say anything negative about this movie... It might be perfect... IT IS!!! But if you haven't seen this wonderful part of movie history, you MUST go to the nearest video club AND GET IT!!! I don't think I have added anything to the collection of positive reviews, but THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!101%... Great, great, great, great, great...",10,0,1,3 April 2000
