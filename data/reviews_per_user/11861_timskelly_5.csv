The Blair Witch Project," Viewing conditions and state of mind are everything.
","When there were only(!) 90 posting about this film there were only seven that did not range from from 'really scary' to 'best film ever made!' All seven disliked the film and four viewed it on video. I just came from a midnight screening that was packed with college students. I have to guess, but judging by the boos, hisses and only moderate applause, it was not seen by 90% of these viewers as 'the scariest movie ever made.'Viewing conditions and state of mind are everything. This (very well edited) film does not come to you, you have to go to it, almost literally. If you want to be scared, see it in a movie theater. Unlike most fright films, try to go when the theater is almost empty. Crowd reactions will take you 'out' of the film. And I mean this in the best sense of the word, be naive. Any critical thought applied to The Blair Witch Project blasts through it like a searchlight through a tissue. What you will see then is a very thin excuse for a film.I would like to recommend that you find and rent a copy of 'Cannibal Holocaust,' the original 'found footage' horror documentary. Unfortunately, you probably won't find it, and if you did, the fake (human) and real (animal) butchery would definitely put you off. However, for the strong of stomach, that is a film that is not only disturbing in broad daylight, but also disturbs to instruct. Two things that The Blair Witch Project cannot claim for itself.In short, if you've never gotten over your childhood fears and are still afraid of the dark, even just a little, under the right conditions, Blair Witch is for you.Otherwise, skip it.",4,0,2,1 August 1999
The Matrix Revolutions," Check the credits
","Great action and more sophomoric writing. Still, better than 'Reloaded.'>POSSIBLE SPOILERThere is a credit for 'Deus Ex Machina.' Classical reference, joke, or an admission of laziness. You be the judge. At least they're up front about it.",Null,0,0,7 November 2003
Van Helsing," Anybody remember `Howard the Duck?'
","I'll get to `Van Helsing' in a bit, but firstI was a huge fan of the original `Howard the Duck' comic book. Artist Frank Brunner told me this story: A few years after co-creating `Howard the Duck,' Frank visited the effects house, ILM, looking for work. As the ILM people leafed through his amazing portfolio, one said, `You draw almost as good as our guys. (insult) We have this film coming up called `Howard the Duck. We might be able to use you on that.' (injury)Hubris and Ignorance, the film industry's most famous couple, eclipsing even Tracy and Hepburn, Astaire and Rodgers and Abott and Costello. (Who also met The Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster.)`Howard the Duck' was made shortly after `Ghostbusters.' It was clear that the ILM effects team wanted to out-do that film in every way it could, and the result was one of the most overblown, senseless motion pictures in history. I was so shaken from seeing it in the theater that I quickly visited a friend who calmed me with Orson Welles' `Chimes at Midnight.' I was still shaking the next day, so we took in Eric Rohmer's `Boyfriends and Girlfriends.' Peace at last.The film, `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' was criticized for many things, but it did have certain charms of its own. One was the clever portrayal of Mr. Hyde via an actor wearing prosthetics rather than using a CG character, excepting the climax, which gave us a small taste of what was to come in `Van Helsing.' The second I saw a fully CG Mr. Hyde appear in `Van Helsing' I knew I was going to have to dig into my library for every Eric Rohmer film I had. Clearly, ILM was out to prove that it could over-blow any movie, even `Howard the Duck.' More is not better, guys, especially when every eye in the theater understands that what they are looking at is not in the least bit real. I have to blame director Stephen Sommers here. With `The Mummy Returns' he demonstrated that he could push, push, push, the effects crews to the point where the best they could do was their worst.I managed to sit through `Van Helsing' without trauma, but only because I had been inoculated with `Howard the Duck.' Is `Van Helsing' as horrible as everyone says? Be your own judge. Lot's of people I saw it with seemed to enjoy themselves. But before you go, make sure to rent an amusing, slowly paced French film for your recovery.PS  I really liked `Deep Rising.' Dial it back, Steve.",Null,0,0,8 May 2004
28 Days Later...," Environmentally Friendly Zombies
","Despite being very intense, '28 Days Later' is a zombie movie you can take your (less sensitive) friends to. It's an odd film, in that it isn't terribly odd at all. It is photographed on video and shot and edited in a contemporary, slick manner that creates the illusion of immediacy. Still, in it's own way, it is nearly as chaste as a Hammer film. Not too surprising given England's 'Video Nasties' laws, which could be partly the motivation for changing the zombie rule book -- a zombie picture for a country that doesn't look kindly on zombie pictures. In fact, as has been mentioned elsewhere, '28 Days Later' has less in common with the undead and more with the novel (not the film) 'Day of the Triffids.'Having circumvented Britain's tender sensibilities, and having added some new editing and filming tricks, Danny Boyle does an excellent job of recapitulating the best of George Romero, including his earliest horror effort, 'The Crazies.' I'm not saying this as a criticism, though it does remove some of the film's potential novelty. It is unlikely that the plot will surprise you or leave you, like Romero's films did, with that desire to have your soul cleansed with bleach. The real rage that is missing in '28 Days Later' is George Romero's apparent loathing of human beings in general and the stupid and angry in particular -- the sense that everyone is a zombie, bitten or not.",8,0,0,28 June 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Look out Joel Schumacher!
","What a mess! Once 'The Bride' grabs her flight to Japan, I suggest you unfasten your seatbelt, feel free to walk about the cabin and right out of the theater. 'Kill Bill Vol.1' is a 'Batman & Robin' version of the great films of Asian cinema. Honor the originals and, like Tarantino, enjoy them first hand.",4,4,7,13 October 2003
