Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," i cannot stand this film
","i wouldn't even rate it 1, i think it is awful and i cant believe that it was allowed to be shown, let alone put on a DVD. it is racist and incredibly rude and abusive. i don't care if it is supposed to be funny, but i think it is atrocious. how would you like it if it were you who was having the mickey taken out of u, no one probably agrees with me but that is how i feel and everyone is entitled to an opinion, and this is mine.I don't think it should be allowed, i think if it were it should be an 18. i cant even bear to remember anything about it. it made me wince and still makes me wince....especially this one scene, im not going to go into it. but someone please tell me how this is comedy, and i don't dare to think that someone might actually agree with some of the comments that are made during the film. but then everyone can have their own opinion...",1,3,7,5 November 2007
