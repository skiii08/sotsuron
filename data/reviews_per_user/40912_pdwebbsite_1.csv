National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Tell No Secrets
","Have you ever had a drink of pop after it's been sitting out too long? That's right, it's flat--all the fizz is gone. Same thing happened to National Treasure's Book of Secrets, the pop, the fizz, the sparkle is not there anymore. It's still a great movie to watch, one the whole family can enjoy, but as with most hits, the sequels don't usually nail it quite the same. The 'gee whiz, I didn't know that' about history is still there (3 Liberty Ladies?), along with the likable characters (Riley is the best sidekick, and the main reason I went), and the intelligent plot, as well the stellar performances. Yet, it came off a little flat overall. I still didn't understand Ed Harris's role as a villain. Sean Bean was a great villain, one with ingenuity and cunning. Harris seemed only functionary. The best part of the movie was the Goofy short that came with it.",8,1,4,22 December 2007
