Iron Man 3," Star Trek: Out of Darkness
","1966 was a very good year.A certain, extremely talented, writer was born. England won the World Cup.Star Trek aired.I've grown up with Star Trek. The likes of Star Trek, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica and so many others helped me visit strange, new worlds and boldly go (or baldly in the case of Jean-Luc) where I had no chance of actually going in real life.Gene Roddenberry was a genius to my young mind, and a visionary to my older one. Creating a western in space, along the lines of Wagon Train - except with space ships and aliens rather than wagons, horses and Indians, of course.Okay, so Star Trek, the actual original pilot, starring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike instead of William Shatner as Captain James Tiberius Kirk, aired in 1965, but Star Trek as we know it exploded on our television sets a year later, the year of my birth (I'm that talented writer I mentioned, if you hadn't guessed).As we were born in the same year, I didn't get to see the programme until I was older on one of its many re-runs. It didn't matter to me. At the time, I didn't know what a repeat was. I didn't get the chance, as a child, to watch it that regularly. The main programmes I was able to see each week were The Muppets and Doctor Who - both still favourites to this day. But I watched Star Trek whenever I could. It was brilliant. I wanted to be Spock. I wanted to see what was in the scanner thing he always looked into. I wanted POINTY EARS! And then there were the spin offs. The Next Generation. Voyager. Deep Space 9. Enterprise. All good (and occasionally bad) in their own way. I loved TNG. Ryker was a bit too much in places with his puffed out chest and stance and bravado. Wesley grated. But Jean Luc, Seven of Nine and most especially Data were brilliant. I enjoyed Voyager, though I have yet to watch the final episodes. Deep Space 9 was OK. Not bad, but it didn't grab me, and Enterprise, I wanted to like, and for the most part did, but it was let down by not enough drive from the producers.Either way, there was plenty to fill my Trekking time. Also, we had the films.Star Trek: The Motion Picture was amazing. I so loved that film. I was elated when they made an actual movie of the series. I enjoyed all the original movies, to be honest, with The Voyage Home being, probably, my favourite. But then, horror upon horrors, they made a PREQUEL! I don't know if I was ready. I think I figured they were going to be sort of cashing in on the name. It wouldn't be that good. I could hope, but I think I expected to not really like it.That shows what I know.I'd been a fan of Zachary Quinto from his Heroes days, and love him in American Horror Story (both seasons). I wondered how he'd fit into the role of my favourite Vulcan. Extremely well, as it happens. The first of the new Star Trek films was excellent, as far as I'm concerned. Exciting, well plotted and full of life. I wasn't sure of the hot-headed young Kirk at first, but I quickly warmed to him. As for the also young Sulu and Chekov, they're very well written and cast. Chekov is hilarious! So, it worked. A big thumbs up.Then, oh my gosh! They were bringing out a sequel with none other than Benedict Cumberbatch! I honestly couldn't wait. I am desperate for the return of Sherlock, which was my first introduction to Mr. Cumberbatch. His portrayal of the seminal detective grabbed me by the bits and didn't let go. The way the show was done all together was sooo good. If you haven't seen either of the two series, it's a definite must see. Moriarty was brilliant and Martin Freeman as Watson was a delight. I quite like Elementary, but Sherlock is something else! So, Benedict Cumberbatch as the bad guy? Bring it on! And what a bad guy? Khan, no less! Star Trek: Into Darkness is great. Really, a fab film. It brings the Star Trek franchise quite firmly up to date. Plenty of meat and a bit of gristle thrown in for good measure. There's excitement, pathos, humour (you've got to love the ever fine Simon Pegg as Scotty) and lot's more.I saw the 2D version of the film, but I'm told the 3D effects were excellent. If you're going to make a movie in 3D, give us something to make us glad we sat there with silly glasses on. I was so disappointed with Wrath of the Titans (for many reasons but...) when, at the climactic explosion at the end, it cut to the base camp. Where were the bits of god thrown in our faces, hmmm? I didn't see, so I don't know, but it appears the 3D was used to good effect. That's what we want. Make us duck out of the way. Make us want to reach out. Don't just give it a bit of depth, as wearing those glasses detracts from the colour and essence of the film - we need something to compensate.Star Trek: Into Darkness is a definite hit. If you're not a Star Trek fan, don't let that put you off. There's a great deal more to this film than the name.Oh, one thing. I so wanted Kirk - or better yet, Spock - to, when wondering where they'd go for the start of their 5 year journey, say: 'First star on the right, and straight on till morning.'Live longer and prosper, people.",9,0,2,28 July 2013
Oblivion," Oblivion or Oblivious?
","Oblivion or Oblivious? Well, the former is verging on the latter, it has to be said...I'm a big lover of science fiction, in its many forms. As a child I avidly read Asimov, Clarke and many more. I bought the first issue of 2000AD, the comic which introduced us to Judge Dredd. I'm sure it had a plastic spinning disc with three arms in the centre stuck to the front as a free gift... I once had a sew on arm patch from an Apollo mission and a poster for Revenge of the Jedi.That's right... I said 'Revenge'.As a movie addict, I devour the films. Whether it's 2001: A Space Odyssey,Star Wars, the X-Men films (I used to read their comics too), Event Horizon, Black Hole, I, Robot and more, I'd rush to watch and thoroughly enjoy being taken away to times and realities far from my own.I'm quite partial to most Tom Cruise films too. Action and adventure, thrills and spills, they all entice me. I wasn't over keen on the last Mission Impossible film, however. Great ideas and stunts, but should the gadgets go wrong? I don't think so. I love Simon Pegg, and he was great as the franchise's 'Q' character, but those gloves, the mask creator doodad and so on. Part of the essence of MI was the spectacular inventions as well as the non-stop action.Cruise was good in Collateral and I thought inspired in Rock of Ages. Rain Man is a classic (though Dustin Hoffman steals the film).2015, the Year of the Blockbuster brings us another outing from the Mission Impossible stable, but it has to go up against new iterations of Independence Day, Star Wars, Terminator, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Avengers, Finding Dory (Nemo), Fantastic Four, Jurassic Park, James Bond, Avatar, Hunger Games, Alvin & the Chipmunks (?!) and Inferno (Dan Brown). There's also slated a Warcraft film, Assassin's Creed, another Kung Fu Panda, the Penguins of Madagascar and possibly even a Prometheus 2! And breathe.Oh, and prepare my tent for camping out at the Parkway (my local cinema in Cleethorpes - great place!) So. I had high hopes, as Kodaline might say, of Oblivion. It's a bit of a surprise that I hadn't found myself watching it long before now, but life waits for no film, hence I didn't. So there. Last night I had chance of a quiet moment or two and decided, finally, to go for a bit of a Cruise.It started out slow. Probably, I thought, building the tension. Waiting for the huge climax. Interspersing the film with pathos and then flipping into explosions and stunts and breathlessness.After a while of not a lot happening, I interrupted my viewing for 20 minutes of the 30 Day Shred (day 4). I was certainly more breathless from this than anything Oblivion had thrown at me thus far. I then returned to the movie hoping things would pick up.They did, but they also didn't. I won't give anything away about the plot (I had my fingers burned when I accidentally let slip a very important fact regarding the wonderful Judi Dench's brilliant M portrayal in Skyfall - oops), but then, there wasn't much of one to give away.The various set pieces, for me, weren't big enough. They didn't draw out the tension and I couldn't find myself particularly feeling for the characters. I didn't fear the Predator lookey-like Scavs. Olga Kurylenko is decidedly lovely, though, but her performance was a touch wooden. I was disappointed with Morgan Freeman - something I could never imagine myself saying. Shawshank is one of my all time favourites. I thought he was a fab God in the Almighty films. I even liked him in Dreamcatcher. Unfortunately, his brief appearance in this left me cold. It was too predictable. It had been done too many times before.And we knew, didn't we, he'd go for that gun turret? There were many things that could have been built on, the events in the Radiation Zone for one. I thought many of the ideas were good, but none of this film was particularly new. And Independence Day 2 is coming out in a couple of years, please don't steal ideas from the first and then do them so blandly! I could go on, but this film did it for me (went on). It's a shame. The cast was good. The ideas were there, but they weren't developed.It was fine for a bit of entertainment, but just a bit. At the end, I asked myself if I'd enjoyed it, but couldn't really answer. I didn't NOT enjoy it, but that's not the same thing.The shower afterwards and a mind spinning through various aspects of Visual basic code I was trying to figure out helped me ease into sleep.Oblivion could almost have done that itself.",7,0,3,28 July 2013
