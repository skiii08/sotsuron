Your Name.," I BET THIS WILL BE THE MOST FAVORITE ALL THE TIME
",I was a hater of Anime. From someone special I heard about this movie. I started watching. After finished it I was in a paradox. I watched it again. I'm not that weak but I don't know why my eyes are fulfill with tears. This movie is something special. Every time I heard about this movie I got butterflies in my heart and feels like I need to cry hard. I don't hate this feeling. I with I can go there. I like every thing about this movie. Everything. I can't explain how much it is. It's been two or three years I watched it. But I still have the same feelings. Today! in the beginning of the new year I thought I should do something that I love. And I did. Watch it and you'll love better.,10,0,0,31 December 2018
