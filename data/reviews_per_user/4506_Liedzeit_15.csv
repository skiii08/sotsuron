Vertigo," Keep rewatching it
","There are some films that you somehow don´t like and that you watch every time they are on TV. For me Vertigo is a prime example. It is easy to see what is fascinating: the music by Herrmann the face of Jim Stewart the great sub plot with the down-to-earth friend Mitch played brilliantly by Barbara Bel-Geddes. (When I first saw it as an adult at the beginning of the eighties dozens of people started whispering 'Miss Ellie' when she had her first scene.) Why did she end the engagement when she obviously still loves him? The thought of recreating your lost loved one. But at the same time the film is overlong (which is an euphemism for boring). You seem to see Stewart behind a wheel all the time. The plot seems to be too constructed. There is no hint of why in the world Judy should go through everything. Why not confess to John? So she started to love him only later? Why in the world should someone push a puppet down the staple? (Well, that was the troubling thought I had when I first saw the film as a kid. There should be a law against kids watching great movies. They have fun enough being kids and it spoils  the films for them when they watch them later.) Anyway I will watch it again and find out what makes this one ultimately a masterpiece or what it is that makes one think it might be one.",8,4,4,22 July 1999
To Be or Not to Be," A laugh is nothing to be sneezed at
","Robert Stack as Lt. Sobinski is colorless. There is a disgusting scene at the end when the two Germans jump out of the plane, following the order of the Fuhrer. What a poor, cheap joke. And even that is topped two minutes later, when for no other reason then to get another cheap laugh, Bronski has to parachute out of the plane, so that one poor peasant can say 'First Hess, now him'.Having said that you can get a rough idea how brilliant this film must be when I tell you that it is easily the best film ever made! Not only best comedy, but best period. Beating in my personal list GWTW, Thief of Bagdad, Taxi Driver. Lets dive into it. First of all there is this daring concept of having a Polish theater group in the middle of the Great War outwitting their oppressors. We have a great tight story that is much more than just a vehicle to transport jokes or funny scenes. You could make a very suspenseful spy thriller out of the plot. Then there is this terrific cast, Jack Benny who needed only this one film to achieve immortality, beautiful Carol Lombard who had the task of playing the faithful wife to the great actor Joseph Tura and at the same time being just believably enough attracted to this guy who is able to drop a couple of tons of bombs. Stack of course, must be colorless, since what we do not need in this story is any serious lover's triangle. Bressart is great, Sig Ruman is just unable of being not hilariously funny and here he can give us the performance of his life. Even the tiniest role is played by an acting genius. Lional Atwill as Rawich is perhaps the one that deserves in this cast of giants a special mentioning, because the way he portrays the actor who just cannot stop overacting is alone worth watching the film half a dozen times. But most of all To be or Not to Be is funny. There are a number of running gags that have never been topped in the history of film comedy. The Schultz thing, the joke on the Hitler ending up as a cheese joke and of course the Hamlet gag. But best of all: Concentration Camp Erhardt. So far I could always resist (or I chickened out) but one of these days I will sit in row two of a Hamlet performance and I will leave at the start of the monologue. The highlight of the film is the scene when Benny/Tura is confronted with dead Professor Siletzky the guy he is just impersonating. Even after having seen this film at least 30 times it still makes me marvel how they could come up with that. My favorite scene though is right at the beginning, when Tura tells his wife that for the next play he has thought that her name should appear above his own.And she says 'Oh, darling, that is so sweet of you. But of course, I do not care'. He says 'That is what we thought. So we won't do it'. And she says 'Oh'. Not more. But this little scene is enough to set the mood for the entire film and it tells us all we need to know about their marriage. By the way, this scene is even funnier in the German version. Maybe it is just that I only recently had the chance of watching the Original (thanks DVD makers) but I really think the German adds something to it. Especially the off-voice at the beginning 'Lubinski, Kubinski...' is more relaxed than the original and fits the mood of the film much better. And there is a great alliteration in German 'Welcher widrige Wind...' I could ramble on forever. But now is the time to just sit back and enjoy the film once again.",10,4,12,18 April 2003
Fight Club," A punch on the nose
","This one is sick. I had hoped and prayed I would not live to see another film as bad as the Matrix but Fight Club is. In a way it is even worse since it is not as obviously silly. The actors can really play the directing is as good as could be expected by someone like Fincher (I loved Se7en). So what is wrong? Well, it is sick. Now, that is not a smart thing to say when criticising  a film but there is no way to avoid it. Fight Club is extremely violent. This is something I do not like in general but for a movie with a title like Fight Club to be expected. And it is not senseless violence like in Matrix but belonging to the story. Indeed it is the essence and in this sense acceptable. What is wrong, if not evil, is that it is presented as a possible solution to the emptiness we feel in our lives. So our generation did not enjoy the blessing of an honest good war? No wonder we degenerate and start buying IKEA furniture. Is this a joke? It is not meant as one.
Our hero (the `Narrator') cannot sleep. He is not really happy but who is. What to do? First he finds some unusual hobby. He goes to meetings of people who really suffer.  And the mixture of real feelings mixed with the ridiculous situation gives him energy some fake `sense of life'. There he meets the beautiful Marla. My heart jumped with joy. There was some kindred spirit. They should fall in love, marry, settle down, have some kids live happily (more or less) ever after. That is what I want (I know I am the one who is sick but this is what watching classic Hollywood movies did to me.) It would have been perfect. Unfortunately the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. That is why our hero first has to go to point zero. And he does it by establishing this Fight Club and moving in with lovely Brad. Okay, why not. But does it have to be terror organisation next? Come on. What is the point of the whole thing? You enjoyed the film? Punch yourself on the nose and start thinking. Or even better stop pretending that you do. The schizophrenia angle was rather foreseeable but the happy ending was okay. Like I said... the two hours in between where at best annoying at worst... (I will think of something.)",2,3,7,16 January 2000
Spider-Man 2," With great responsibility comes great drama
","I liked the first Spiderman but could not quite understand why it was considered to be that brilliant. For me the silly Green Goblin 'costume' spoiled much of the fun. With Dock Ock we have only the second best Spidey villain but as played by Molina he is much, much better for the film. He is exactly like I thought Ock should appear on the screen. Dito for J. Jonah Jameson. He was just amazing. Please Hollywood, there is nothing wrong in considering a best supporting  actors award for him. There are a million great things in this one and I cannot thank the creators enough for giving us a sequel that captures the spirit of the original comic. There is really love and respect for the original but with a lot of unique new ideas that make this work perfectly. (Putting the Bugle into the Flat Iron Building was a stroke of genius.) I still think it was wrong to start with MJ instead of Gwen Stacy - the only real love of Peter Parker - but given the fact that today's readers would not know her that is okay especially as Kirsten Dunst plays her role in a way that unites character traits of both Gwen and MJ. When Peter gave up his Spiderman identity (I think in #50) it was one of the greatest issues in the series and writer(s) of this wisely built the script around this emotional highlite with nearly exactly the image from the comic. Bravo. I do hope the the third part will be as good as this. But if the creative team stays I have no doubts that it will.",10,0,0,12 July 2004
Notting Hill," Blitzsieg
","One of the songs I hated most in the seventies was 'She' by Charles Aznavour. And now hearing this at the beginning of Notting Hill with the image of Anna Scott/Julia Roberts makes me nearly faint. It is incredible beautiful. It sets the mood. I knew after 20 seconds that I would love the movie. That is something that only happened once before with 'Trading places' and there the music was by Mozart. Why did it happen again with Aznavour? I don«t know. It is magic.If there is something wrong with the film it is that it is too perfect. There is not one bad scene in it. Never too slow never too fast. At first viewing I thought that the young ladies William«s friend introduce to him were a little off. But at second time I found that even these scenes worked. So it is a little bit synthetic. They tried to take everything from Four Weddings without really repeating themselves. All clichs are avoided. And that is something you feel and it made me just a little bit uncomfortable. But if it is done as brilliantly as that I do not mind at all.Although I do not like Julia Roberts that much Notting Hill was in a way even better than Four Weddings. And not because of Spike but because the character Hugh plays is better developed. Playing a young man who is shy (and polite) and at the same time witty he is totally believable. This is something only Hugh Grant can do. Along with Cary he is the only actor who really gets away with the fact that he is handsome (from a male point of view). Robert Redford for example or Clint Eastwood just seem to be too much in love with themselves to be endured. If I were a woman I would probably fall in love with someone like Jimmy Stuart but if the man had to be handsome only the Grants would be eligible. Others like Paul Newman or Gregory Peck look great without being annoying but they are too much like gods. You would not really want to be with them.One thing Notting Hill has adopted from Four Weddings is that the female character is not as pure, 'good' as the male and that one can still understand why our hero loves her. And when Julia makes her 'I am just a girl' speech I had tears in my eye. Rule of thumb: Any film that makes me cry gets a 10.I had the good luck to watch the film in the original at first time. Normally a film does not loose much being dubbed. (Woody Allen is supposed to have said that the German voice fits his character better than his own and I certainly agree, same would be true for Robert deNero for example.) But Hugh«s timing is so exact that in this case the original is twice as good. But even the German version would get a 10 easily.",10,0,0,13 August 1999
The Bourne Identity," 39 Steps
","Remember '39 Steps'? There was this man who was on the run. And then there was this totally strange woman with him. Why was she with him? Because she was hand-cuffed to him, that is why. And why was she hand-cuffed? Because otherwise there would be no earthly reason why she would follow him. And because movie makers at the time had some respect for their audiences. That brings me to Bourne. Now, it may seem unfair to compare some run-off-the-mill film to Hitchcock, but the sad fact is these guys nowadays (sorry to generalize here but the movie made me so angry) don't care about plausibility because they despise their popcorn-eating audience. Of course, you should not start thinking about the story of 39 steps which is also ridiculous. But the point is Hitchcock makes you want to believe and care for the characters. Suspense of disbelief and all that. In Bourne Identity the first 5 minutes are okay. We just do not want to know why the hero has this bank number implanted. In case he loses memory? He goes to Switzerland? I buy that but then he beats the police guys, just why? You have pockets full of money but have to spend the night in the house of a friend when you are on the run? Potente is not bad but she surely does not save this one.",5,1,2,24 November 2002
Judgment at Nuremberg," Three Generations of Imbeciles
","This film is of course remarkable for its sheer number of stars.Tracy plays the American judge who has to find how guilty hisGerman colleagues were who played along the Nazi rules duringthe Third Reich. I am not the biggest Tracy fan but here he is perfect. As are allother actors with one exception. Richard Widmark the prosecutoris absolutely believable in his crusade. Marlene Dietrich, finallyshowing some signs of age, represents the proud, art-loving'good` and noble German. In one of the most beautiful subtleromances on screen she and Tracy are strangely attracted to eachother. She is trying to convince Tracy that not all Germans were evil, thatnot all Germans even knew what was going on. She is very goodin it, probably believing herself even so far as to think that her latehusband,  who was a General (put to death by Widmark) wascompletely innocent. Tracy seems moved but in the end isunconvinced. Great the beer-drinking-song scene where the uglyGermans in the background seem to contradict Marlene's words.In an exceptionally great scene when Tracy is about to leave thecountry he calls her. The telephone rings again and again then thecamera moves and you see Marlene sitting just in front of it - justbeautifully filmed. Montgomery Clift is amazing. As a witness of the practice ofsterilization he easily wins our sympathies, especially by admittingthat he was not interested in knowing the birthday of Hitler. Butthings are not quite as simple. He is slow-witted and MaximilianSchell must cruelly demonstrate this. Schell won the Oscar for this role, and as the saying goes, welldeservedly so. He is arguing forcefully and yet humanely. Verynice, the way he puts his forefinger in front of his lips, seeming tosay I have thought about this thoroughly - trust me.  In one scenehe reads a passage from a law book that argues in favour ofsterilization with the conclusion `Three generations of imbecilesare enough'. It sounds like cruel Nazi jargon but was actuallywritten by Oliver Wendell Holmes and was the basis for law inVirginia. (Here is a bizarre coincidence: when I went to bed afterwatching the movie I took up the book I am reading right nowwhich is `The Flamingo Smile' by Stephen Jay Gould. The verynext chapter I was starting to read was about sterilization practiceand exactly the same passage by Holmes was quoted! Gouldinvestigated in the case of the woman who was sterilized by thislaw because she was imbecile and the daughter of an imbecileand mother of an imbecile, thus three generations. He found outthat her daughter - diagnosed to be imbecile at age 8 months(!)turned out to be an at least average pupil at school.)Now, the exception I was talking about, was Burt Lancaster. He allbut ruins the film. It is not entirely his fault since the role was verybad. All he has to do is sitting there stone-faced watching the trial.He is supposed to be the tragic character who is the noble goodguy who by accident became a Nazi judge. Then at one point ashis lawyer `goes to far' he makes his statement, saying that hewas indeed guilty. Unbearably bad lines badly performed. The film has been criticized as being preachy, and it is true tosome extent. But I have no idea how it could have been avoided.Lancaster's part is absolutely crucial. (I just could not stand it). Atleast in the final scene, when Lancaster expected to morallypardoned by his judge, Tracy tells him that the number ofinjustices or murders are not the point but that one knowinglyspoken unjust judgment for whatever reasons is enough to sellyour soul. And that is the point. As he himself has demonstratedwith his judgment. Under political pressure (because of Cold War)he still puts the judges to jail for life. It is all about integrity. Eventhough all were released within a couple of years, his judgmentstays. &#0;",9,1,5,20 November 2002
Disturbia," Minnie
","This is a film that I would never have watched normally. A sort-of-remake of Rear Window with teenagers? What a terrible idea! But still, on a long flight with nothing better to do I was curious enough. Expecting to not give it more than 10 minutes I was very pleasantly surprised. It not a great film but very well done and entertaining. I liked the idea to have the the hero of the story to be under house arrest instead of having a broken leg. The love angle was a bit foreseeable, but quite okay. And I loved it how Kale becomes jealous and plays some cool (i.e. freaky to young ears) 70ies music to spoil the party Ashley was given. She understandingly upset comes over and he asks 'What is? Don't you like Minnie Riperton?' This is missing in the quote section. To me the highlight of the film. And I should not forget to mention David Morse. Great actor.",7,0,3,7 November 2007
Dreamgirls," Magic missing
","I was quite sure I would like this movie. But I did not. What we get is the story of a sixties girl group based loosely on the career of the Supremes. Excellent. There is only one mayor problem with this. The music just does not work. The Supremes had a couple of wonderful hits and we get nothing of it. What an incredible idea to let someone write some songs and trying to make us believe that these were number 1 hits in the 60s. It is just ridiculous. Hudson who plays the fat girl with the great voice that has to leave, does have a nice voice and even some kind of charisma. What she does not have is even one song that is worth listening. Same for Beyoncé. She is certainly beautiful and her voice is okay. But she is not allowed to sing let's say 'Stop in the Name of Love.' So compared to say Ray, this is a tremendous let down. There was something like Motown Magic. This has nothing of it at least not as far as the music is concerned. I liked the costumes and the dancing and the nice 70s wallpapers but that is not enough.Eddie Murphy is allowed for about 30 seconds to put on a straight face. Also he plays a drug addict. That this qualifies for an Oscar nomination is quite unbelievable.",5,7,12,17 February 2007
Gone with the Wind," There is a lot to be said for it
","'There is a lot to be said for it' is a song by the Sparks who really make fun of it, continuing 'but I don't know what...' I certainly do. It is quite simple. GWTW is the best film ever made by any serious and sensible criteria. Magnificent story, wonderful acting, especially Leigh (although she was clearly miscast, since the book said Scarlett was not beautiful - only joking), great music etc. It is amazing that you can watch it again and again feeling just poor delight. You never have the feeling of being confronted with a piece of art. Although it clearly is the highest art. It makes me sad to hear that people do not like it. It is something I should accept but I really cannot. Especially if looking back after sixty years it is denounced as politically incorrect. As a guest present to the first alien race we will meet someday what do we choose? Festen? Independence Day? Taxi Driver? GWTW would be perfect. One more thing: Except maybe for Name of the Rose there is not a better transition of a book to the big screen.GWTW is only my second favorite, but whereas I could easily accept it if someone does not care much for my favorite (To be or not to be) I certainly cannot take seriously anyone who will not include GWTW in his Top 10.",10,0,0,5 July 2000
Batman Begins," Joker, please come back
","What a sad affair. I was looking forward to this and was bitterly disappointed. Batman Begins should have been as good as the first in the series but to me it is as bad as Batman and Robin, if for totally different reasons. Let me start with the good things. First Batman. Christian Bale is the best Batman yet. He is good looking without looking ridiculous. The acting is adequate and it is a shame that the script did not allow him to make use of his talent. I liked Gordon/Oldman. Mark Boone was okay. And Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane was brilliant. The others? Caine a caricature, Freeman the same, Neeson is just incredibly bad. In a superhero movie (and I would include the Bond films here) the woman has to be beautiful and she should be charismatic. How anyone could come up with the idea of casting Katie Holmes is a mystery. Gotham was very good, more realistic than Burton's but equally good. When the camera showed us the bad, corrupt and yet beautiful city I really liked the movie. Unfortunately the music spoiled it immediately. Hans Zimmer is just amazing. He is at the same time one of the most successful composers in Hollywood and easily the worst. Every film where he contributed the music is bad (I did not check that but I think I can rely on memory). At best the music is just boring at worst it totally spoils the mood. How he keeps his job and reputation is just beyond me. We learn the origin of Batman. Good idea. But the trip to Asia? Is that not the origin of Dr. Strange? But I could buy that. But what I cannot tolerate is a bad villain. Now I understand that these days the Evil cannot be just evil. It is boring. But there is a world of a difference between a good villain like Joker, Magneto, Doc Ock (and hopefully Dr. Doom) and Ra's Al Ghul/Ducard. I know it is in a good tradition of the Bible but the Evil wanting to destroy because people are bad is just a bit too ridiculous. Finally, the car. Yes, Batman drives in a car. Why? First to make the toy makers happy and second because there is this Hollywood wisdom: If you do not have a story put in a car chase. This is utterly repulsive. If there is someone older than 5 years on this planet who actually enjoys seeing a car jumping from roof to roof I would like to be introduced to him. Chances are he escaped from Arkham.",3,1,6,25 June 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Weird and wonderful and boring
","What are the chances of me going to see a film called 'Charlie and the Chocolate factory'? I would say maybe 0.5%. I do not care for chocolate and I do not need children's films or fantasies. But the fact that it is a Burton adds 10% and the presence of Depp another 20% and so I ended up watching it. It is a weird film to use Depps favorite word. Which is fine. It is daringly different. Which is fine. I have been a Burton fan since Batman. But unfortunately visual genius does not make a film. The actors were good, the music effective but in the end and I hate to say it, I did not like it. I give the whole creative team any credit but they failed to entertain me. It is a chocolate fantasy with the message that family is even more important. Very nice but also very boring.",4,1,3,31 August 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," It is a wonderful woman
","Since most of the good things about this film have already been said let us concentrate on Donna Reed. Jimmy as we know wants to leave town and see the world. But if there was ever a convincing reason why not to go for your dream her name is Donna Reed. She is the perfect image of a woman, wife and mother. And the scene when she is called by her I Ah friend when Jimmy was about to leave and she comes up with the brilliant idea to call him back and then talk together into the phone is the true highlight of the film in my opinion.",10,0,3,29 December 1999
The Holiday," A new Senta
","This one is known in Germany as 'Die Liebe kennt keine Ferien' (Love does not know holidays) which even within the glorious tradition of mal-translations of German cinema is a true highlight. Now, Holiday is what is called a Romantic Comedy which basically means there are 2 people a boy and a girl that fall in love and marry at the end (well, they 'stay' which each other these days). And in between, if it is any good, some funny things are said and done and we all feel happy. There is not too much wit in it because if there is it is called a screwball comedy and they do not make them any more. Here there are four instead of two. Two woman, who had suffered enough from the male of the species decide to swap houses. Cameron comes to a lovely English cottage and Kate to incredible L.A. This is really done exceptionally well. How they react to their new domicile. Of course a synonym for romantic comedy is predictability. And it does not come as a surprise that both fall in love with the leading men. Which of course, is nice and right. But when you think of it it is sort of sad. Cameron has all this wonderful books with her. And instead of reading them and enjoying a couple of quiet days she has to fall for Jude Law. Anyway. The story is very silly but lovely enough. And if Hugh Grant had played the part of Jude I probably would have really enjoyed it. Law is not really bad but who can care for a man who claims to be drunk and thus has to sleep at his sister's house when it is plain from his behavior that he could not have had more than half a pint? Kate is also okay the subplot with the old writer guy touching. Black totally unbelievable. But Cameron is just brilliant. She saves the movie. And why? Because she looks like Senta Berger (with just a touch of Meg Ryan). I never noticed before. Very nice.",7,2,6,26 December 2006
The Matrix," Disgrace to the human race
","Take a bit from 'Men in Black' (leave the humor out) something from 'Last Man Standing' (leave good acting out) from 'Twelve Monkeys' (leave real suffering and compassion out) and take half a dozen other ones (like some 'Martial Arts') mix it and get a block buster. Hey, add a deep philosophical idea like that maybe everything is unreal!It sounds like a joke but it is not. They actually got away with it with 'The Matrix'. I mean probably every bright 15 year old comes up with the idea one day that everything is fake that somehow only he (or she?) can see through it. And I do not say you cannot make a film out of it but has the result to be like this? The Matrix is by far the most stupid film I ever saw. I want to believe in bizarre concepts but this is so mind-boggingly stupid that it would mean too much honor to even start talking about it. I have seen a lot of senseless violence but this must get a price for the best pretext: They can 'beam' into a particular 'space-time' point of the program but not quite so our heroes have to literally shoot their way through. Amazing! The sad thing about it is that people actually enjoy the crap which makes me think that the Matrix probably is true after all. Since it seems unlikely that real people with a mind of their own can take the film seriously or enjoy it there must be some brain-washing or programming going on. My girl friend nearly left me once because I liked a 'horrid' movie like 'Twelve Monkeys' and even she liked The Matrix. She probably hopes that Jesus will look and act like Keanu Reeves at his next coming. What a depressing thought. If the only good thing to say about a film is that visual effects were up to standard one should leave it. The sun glasses were pretty cool though.",2,4,8,22 July 1999
