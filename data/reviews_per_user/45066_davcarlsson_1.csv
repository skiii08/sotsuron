Ford v Ferrari," CGI Bonanza
","Almost hard to tell the differnce between this movie and Cars (Lightning Mcqueen Etc), so much CGI and awful speed sensation. Doing 200mph down a straight on a racetrack or 40mph on a sunday cruise? No one can spot the differenc.Bale and Damon rescue this movie from being a 3-4 rating. Its a decent to good movie but all those CGI stuff just takes you right out off it.",6,0,3,8 January 2020
