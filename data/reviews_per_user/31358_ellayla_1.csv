Black Swan," Shame
","An awful film that spoon feeds clich√© gimmicks to the audience and is truly disrespectful to the struggles a performing artist undergoes when s/he adopts a character as well as anyone who crosses the line into mental affliction. A terribly written script, poor story and character development, below average acting from the lead, disservice to the art of music and ballet. What happened to you Darren? This film is as bad as Requiem and the Wrestler were wonderful. An abomination for cinema and performing arts that this may become the new hallmark in the industry. A shame.",1,117,220,20 January 2011
