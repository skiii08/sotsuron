Requiem for a Dream," This one's heavy
","This is such a punch in the face for those of you who are experimenting all kinds of stuff: stop while you still can. There is no point in throwing your life away for a moment of adrenaline. I'm a 17-year-old girl and I acknowledged the consequences of drug abuse. I just didn't seem to quite comprehend the whole misery around it. Requiem is a heavy movie but is also a worth seeing one! There were some parts in it that I could barely watch such as the ones where Jared Leto (Harry) would show his bruised arm. I think the morals in this are quite well shown: all kinds of drugs get you addicted. Just think for a moment of the consequences that are portrayed: amputated arm, addiction, insanity, prostitution, prison... it is all so sad.I must say I will never try on drugs.",9,0,1,31 January 2010
The Soloist," loved it
","I simply found it wonderful to watch. It might be a little harsh on sensitive people but above all that it's such a great movie! I for instance do not agree with the previous comment. If you're sad, you should watch this movie! It's inspiring in so many ways and it shows off the poverty many people live in. So if you have a home, food on your table and a family you can count on, you live a happy life. Not everybody is that lucky! This movie made me realize how important a friendship is to every single person on Earth. It showed that having everything isn't the most important thing, but having what you are passionate about, that is what matters the most. I hope many people will think alike. It's a must-see!",7,0,0,5 September 2009
