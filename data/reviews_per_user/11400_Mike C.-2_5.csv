The Blair Witch Project," Could've been great.
","This movie showed so much promise in the first hour. I was riveted to my seat. I was hinging on every terrifying sound.....And then it was over. My immediate reaction was almost the same as everyone else in the theater with me.'That's it?'The movie sets up what could've been a very dramatic ending. Unfortunately, it left me hanging when I was expecting to be scared out of my wits. The abrupt ending didn't payoff nearly as well as I expected it to.It's really too bad. This could've been one of the great films if not for a lackluster climax. It's still a good film, but I've seen scarier. Much scarier.",6,0,0,7 August 1999
Glory," Greatest Civil War Film of all time.
","This film incorporates an excellent screenplay with perhaps some of the best acting performances in the history of cinema to create the greatest war film ever. Saving Private Ryan is a big film right now, but its special effects can't compete with this film's heart. Denzel Washington was amazing in this film. The only performance I'd say he did better in was Malcolm X. Matthew Broderick's greatest performance came from this film. Morgan Freeman was even better than his usual magnificent self. The acting in this movie was inspired. Truly the greatest war film ever, and one of the greatest films ever overall.",10,0,0,17 June 1999
American Beauty," Magnificent film.
","From beginning to end, American Beauty is a joy to watch. No one movie has displayed the full array of human emotions like American Beauty does. Some of you who seem to dislike the movie have problems with some of the issues in the film, such as making a pot smoker, who lusts after a teenager, a protagonist. Perhaps the problem lies not within the film, but within your own insecurities. This film is about re-evaluating your own thoughts and emotions. It makes you think about your own nature. Others of you out there seem to think that all of these issues have been touched upon already in other films. Normally, I'd agree that much of the subject matter in the film has been covered elsewhere already. However, it is the performances that make this look at human nature fresh and interesting. Spacey has his best performance since Verbal Kint, and I don't think Benning has had a better performance in her career.
To truly appreciate this film, don't simply try and break it down to its elements. Every movie looks the same when you pick them apart. Look at this movie as a whole. If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend you do so. Make up your own mind about this film. Some may see it as cliched and repetitive. But I, like many others, see it as brilliant. Not the best movie I've ever seen (Not even the best movie with Kevin Spacey that I've seen (The Usual Suspects)), but certainly in my top ten of all time.",10,0,0,8 April 2000
The Usual Suspects," Didn't get a chance to review it when I first saw it.
","And my first viewing of this one was about 30 viewings ago. What an incredible film. In my opinion, only Citizen Kane equals this masterpiece. Kevin Spacey's best performance of his career. (Yes, even better than American Beauty.) He may never have a better role than he did in this movie. I never get tired of watching this film. The ending is the best of any movie I've ever seen. I don't know a single soul who says they could predict that until they saw it. Pure Genius throughout. If you haven't seen it, I strongly, greatly, (I mean I'm on my knees here), urge you to see this film as soon as possible. You won't be disappointed.",10,0,1,12 April 2000
Pi," An intense film from start to finish.
","Of all the independent films put out in this decade, this has to be the most unique.I mean, where else are you gonna see a film about spirals, migranes, and the true name of God?The black and white film adds to the already extremely dark undertones of the film. While on the surface it appears to be a mathematical story, it truly captures the struggle between genius and madness. When watching the film, you can feel Cohen's headaches yourself. It does a great job of making its viewers uncomfortable at the mere sight of Cohen's pain.This is truly an exceptional achievement in filmmaking, and it should not be missed.Be warned though. It is not for all. It is for those who can handle the sheer intensity of the film. I haven't been gripped by a film like this since the Usual Suspects.",10,1,4,17 June 1999
