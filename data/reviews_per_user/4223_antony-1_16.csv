The Avengers," I couldn't even watch all of it
","I love Joss Whedon. I love some comic book movies (X-Men, Daredevil, Batman). I like quite a few of the actors in this.So why on earth did I hate it so much?For me the style was probably the worst thing. Some movies grab me, and make me watch. This didn't from the outset. It felt like a high budget TV episode. The look felt stark and unrealistic (or actually, too realistic probably). It seems to have been filmed for 3D, because even in 2D you you just get lots of weird camera angles and a strange tone to it.The story... well, I just found it hard to pay attention for even the most shortest of times. It just was people doing stuff, but no sense of direction, or story, or building menace. In fact the menace looked like a Stargate TV series villain. Or something from a kids' movie.And the thing is with Stargate, I love the characters. But I don't with this film. They give me no reason to love them. So their actions are thus uninteresting.It doesn't surprise me, seeing afterwards, that Joss Whedon directed it. And it shows - he's a good writer, but doesn't have a lot of directing experience.Having said that, what do I know... look at the numbers it's made!But for me, I couldn't even watch it all the way through. It was completely not captivating.",1,11,41,24 September 2012
Friday Night Lights," So what?
","The main problem with this movie is the 'so what?' factor.What is special about these people, or the events, or that time that it needs to be made into a movie? The movie does not answer these questions in any way.It's some people playing some sport. There's some family issues (ill mother, abusive father) but these are common to many movies and do not make a movie.Any sense of interesting insight into the people's lives is lost due to the mundane plot content and the slo-mo, shaky cam style that is infecting Hollywood; it doesn't make things feel real, on the contrary it makes them feel over-directed.Only the last few minutes of the movie work on any level, driving home the point that our great moments in life are fleeting. However this message is bashed home with all the subtlety of a hammer to the head, so even that is wasted.",2,0,0,25 May 2008
The Notebook," Surprising, touching, wonderful
","I'm going to keep this reasonably brief.I mostly recorded this film because I wanted to see James Marsden, so didn't have any expectations with the movie, and I finally got around to watching it tonight. And, wow, this film was wonderful.Story wise, it's nothing new. True love, hard decisions, awkward parents etc. etc. All standard fodder for a romance movie. However, it pulls it off magically. The actors are brilliant, the characters engaging, the film involving.Now the thing... I'm almost ashamed to admit this. My eyes were very wet. I don't cry when I watch movies. I just don't, it's not me ever. Yet this film got me. This movie was so wonderfully executed, its story so involving, that it just had me sucked in.It feels like you've watched a 15 hour film (not in a bad way) by the end, because you get a feeling of knowing these characters so very well and caring for them so much. It's something that most movies fail to capture, and it's a very rare gift, so I highly recommend this movie.",8,0,0,29 December 2005
Cloverfield," A shot in the arm of cinema; an amazing achievement
","Wow. That's largely how I can sum up this movie. Wow.I was worried about spoilers and, whipped up into the viral marketing frenzy, trotted off to see this movie as soon as was out. Funnily enough there's not a lot be spoilt about. The trailer showed you the Statue of Liberty's head being smashed off as something attacks New York, and that is pretty much it. What it at excels at though, and what could not really be spoiled by spoilers, is the way the film is executed.The story is slightly slow in the setup because you sit there thinking 'get exploding!' but then it grabs hold of your hand and yanks you from scene to scene. Never letting up. I have not been that on the edge of my seat in ages. Goose bumps were on my arms as the film progressed, and as it brought you into the characters' lives so expertly that you start to forget that it's a film.Well maybe that's a bit of hyperbole, to forget that it's a film, but it's so nice to have such a raw film that doesn't have the trappings of normal big movies. No music, no familiar faces... it really did allow one to be swept up in. And it's only when I watch this that I realise how much stuff is added to the average movie that breaks the suspension of disbelief. It's as if Cloverfield stripped away all the tricks of a normal film, and took you to the raw story. It almost makes me annoyed at all the other false, packaged movies out there! Even (I realise this is a weird example, but I feel it sums it up well) they walk through some doors and they are covered in fingerprints. In any movie they'd be polished to the hilt, to ensure they look perfect on screen and to ensure everything looks 'right'. But this is about realism, that someone truly has just grabbed a camera, and it adds to that feeling of reality. It's so nice to have none of the normal trappings of star names, orchestral scores and poncy director camera work.Sadly not everyone gets this. I notice some reviewers criticising the movie for not saying where the monster came from etc. That's a typical response created by movies as they are. They must be flawless, and structured, and answer things. People want them to lead them from A to B to C and tell them that Mr Bad did it, and Mr Bad dies when Mr Good kills him. Films must be able to do what we can't do as humans... go to places quickly in the next frame, invade people's lives like a fly on the wall. Whereas Cloverfield does away with all that. It treats you as if you were there, and you will get NO special treatment because you're watching a movie. It's what makes the movie.Being swept into caring about the characters is quite gradual too. I didn't realise it was even happening, but as it goes on you do increasingly care for them. Their shock and horror is felt by you. And by the other audience members too, I could hear gasps and shouts in the audience as they like me got swept along.It continues this great pace and involvement right up to the end. I was worried about how it would end, but much like the rest of the movie it was done superbly. The ending was sublime, so well done, and a great end to a great cinema experience.My final comment is to watch this in the cinema. If you watch it at home, in your comfortable home, with lights on, and you pause it to get a drink etc. you'll ruin the atmosphere. Watching it at the cinema thrusts you in it. The pace is set, and you can't stop it. And there was something about the tone of the film that really suited watching it with strangers all around me. So please, watch it in the cinema and be prepared for one of the most thrilling films to grace our screens.",9,1,6,2 February 2008
Closer," A bit pretentious, but an enjoyable flick none the less
","Closer was an interesting, and entertaining film. This certainly wasn't a film that bored me. But it then equally so, it wasn't that great a film.It struck me very much pretentious film, that with its forward dialog and troubled character we'd all admire its brilliance. But the characters never, for me, went beyond being puppets for the writer or director's amusement. The never felt real or understandable. The dialog felt very much like a stage production (so I wasn't surprised to then see it was based on a play) and much of the dialog was what a lot of us would think in many of these situation, but not say. So this gave it an almost unreal quality at times.The film also had these time jumps, which are totally unclear at first. This caused me confusion, and again just struck me as another chance for them to try and be different, but rather pointlessly so.Some plots 'twists' are also thrown in, but they may just leave you asking 'Why?' in confusion instead of 'Why?' in contemplation.There are some points of particular merit. Clive Owen steals the show with his performance, and puts Julia Roberts (who is typically Julia Roberts) and Jude Law (who is typical Jude Law) in the shade. Natalie Portman was also wonderful, so I found the main scenes between Clive and Natalie were the best of the film.As I said, I enjoyed the film. It's not a bad film. But it's not particularly fathomable. It does things which try to be clever, but ultimately aren't. You know a clever film because it doesn't try to be clever. It tells its story and lets the viewer come to a conclusion, rather than a contrived direction which it wants you to walk down.If you want a film about the flaws of people, and how they destroy themselves and lives around them, then I recommend The Rules of Attraction instead.",6,1,1,15 January 2005
Lost in Translation," Totally affected, I couldn't even finish it
","It's a rare day that I can't finish a movie, because I like to see even the bad ones through to the end. But what is this nonsense? The movie wreaks of affected directing. The whole adage of 'show don't tell' is flipped on its head here, because the writer/director is 'showing' so much she is in fact telling. It is constructed in a very cynical way that breaks the illusion of the characters and the world that should be created around them. So many moments wreak of the director trying to say something implicitly, thus you are thinking more about the direction than the characters. I can just imagine some of the explanations. 'Look as she sits on the window sill, looking out towards the town all alone... it marks her isolation from those around her.' And in this smug directing, the characters are forgotten. They don't even interact for the first 30 minutes of the film, and it's just clips of anything almost randomly. Ooh look, there's a character receiving mail, there's a character walking through a lobby, oh look there's a character eating. Dull and pretentious.All in all this is a travesty. Pompous directing left the characters way down the list to the point of not even being needed. I gave up after 45 minutes as it was going to another 45 minutes which was light on story, light on characterisation and heavy on amateur, over the top, affected direction.",2,19,36,28 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Far better than the last one - but that's not saying much
","JJ Abrams steered course to a much more satisfying movie than the last one. Unfortunately I can't get over the main issue that the latest trilogy just feels like it doesn't need to exist.Not only that, it seems to undermine the original trilogy. The war you won? You didn't. The big bad you killed? You didn't. The redemption of Anakin meant something? No, it didn't matter.This was an entertaining movie no doubt. And JJ had to do some deus ex machinas and some logic jumps to try and correct the damage of the last awful movie. I can forgive all that.Although a house divided cannot stand, and the competent first movie of the trilogy and this will be forever undermined by the absolute stinker in the middle.I enjoyed the generally upbeat tone of the movie - and the cast chemistry really was at its best as the trilogy came to an end.But the resolution felt too easy and some tired old plot devices used again, this trilogy just felt unnecessary.Move on to new Star Wars pastures please, Disney.",6,4,10,21 December 2019
Bird Box," An enjoyable movie, but the reviews are more terrifying
","I enjoyed it. It wasn't too scary, which I like. Dark humour via Malkovich. Interesting premise that held my interest even if you kind of knew the ending because they told you from the start.The review section is like - as I think Americans would call it - a dumpster fire. Wow. So much bile and vitriol. It's a movie. Chill.It never poses itself as an intellectual affair, and you do not need to demonstrate your intellectual prowess by dissecting the movie.No I don't need the all the answers. Mysteries are fine. These reviewers are probably the people that will then go watch ET and go 'WHY IS THE ALIEN HERE? HOW DOES THE BIKE LEVITATE?' etc.Breathe deeply, and relax. Watch it, enjoy it. Enjoy life.",7,1,2,12 March 2019
The Italian Job," Pretty dire
","I don't have a whole lot to say about this movie, as I had trouble paying attention. It was okay, but that's about it.The characters are by the numbers. No charm, nothing memorable, and many have 'cool' or 'amusing' names to make them stand out. The acting is okay, but Edward Norton looks just plain to embarassed to be in such a cartoon-character role after starring in such brilliant films as 'Fight Club' and 'American History X'.The film picks up towards the end, in terms of entertainment, but not enough to save this movie from being a rather pointless affair.It must be compared with Ocean's 11, but in that film I liked the characters and cared about the outcome. In The Italian Job -- simply, I did not.",4,1,4,10 January 2004
The Hangover Part II," An anxious sequel, more drama than comedy
","I adored the original Hangover, and while I didn't expect this to be quite as good I didn't expect it to be this bad.I don't mind the rehashing... with a sequel to that Hangover it has to be a bit tongue in cheek. But this is like a dark twin to the original movie.The Vegas setup made, despite someone being missing, for a fun, uplifting movie. A sense of 'oh I've been there' but with an exaggerated tone. It was all about what a great night they'd had and were trying to piece it together.The sequel is the opposite, it's a dangerous, anxious movie. They are in a strange lady, and they've lost a 16 year old and his finger is in a bucket. It's a race to find this kid, and work out if he's even alive. There's someone who has unprotected sex with a ladyboy. Someone gets shot. Even the wedding was anxious because of the father-in-law. While I knew they'd find the boy in the end, it still leads to tension while they piece together a bad night (rather than the good night of Vegas).In terms of humour, it wasn't also very funny. There were nuggets of potential jokes but they didn't feel well executed, which is surprising given it's the same director as last time. Mr Chow is excellent, but underutilised in this movie.Then it ends with them finding the boy, who's missing a finger and laughs it off. Erm, yes. This guy who is a gifted musician and wants to be a doctor has lost a finger and doesn't care. And Stu isn't running to get an STD test before he marries his wife, which he would do if some random transsexual prostitute ejaculated into him. Maybe I'm taking this too seriously, but it snaps me out of the movie as a 'step too far'. Or maybe the step too far is the desperate inclusion of Mike Tyson at the end.All in all, I was very disappointed - mostly that it took a fun evening with the lads where while they got up to mischief no harm was done and gave you a feeling of 'what an epic night' in Vegas to this dark tale where there's just no enjoyment as to what they got up to the night before.",3,26,41,30 May 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I gave up
","I normally watch films to the end, even if I don't like them, but sadly I couldn't go all the way with Eternal Sunhine. Anything seemed more interesting than this boring twaddle.As such, having not seen it all, I don't feel that I can write a proper review. But really, nothing there was to latch on to, nothing of interest. This is one of those films where I think people rate it highly just because it blatantly tries so hard and is odd because it can be.First of all there was some obvious jumping around going on, time wise, because events were out of order. It's really becoming a tired cliché of cinema. And while it works wonderfully in some films (Closer, Mulholland Drive et al) I just felt it was complication for complication's sake in this film.But then what happens in this story? We have some teenagers wiping the lead character's memory while drinking his alcohol, smoking pot (ooh, how edgy) and larking about.I'm sorry. We're meant to believe in this story where people have their MEMORIES WIPED (i.e. messing around with their brains) and they let stoned kids do it? Yeah right, that's realistic. Ridiculous.Otherwise all that was happening was just flashes of the lead character's memories, which came across as one of those Star Trek episodes where one of the crew is being mentally invaded by some parasite or something, and the crew saves the crewmember in the end.In short pointless, nothing to draw me in and this DVD is going on eBay. Maybe I'm missing something, after all this is high in the top 250. But whereas many films deserve it, I can't see what people see in this film.",2,5,12,28 December 2005
Avatar," One star? Stop being so ridiculous.
","I see many people rate this one-star. They are contrary for the sake of it. This film may not be your cup of tea, but one star? One star says this film is without worth, worthless. Sorry but that is not Avatar.Even if you hated the story, the visuals are amazing and would deserve more than one star. When watching it, you forget about the 3D after a while... and actually the 3D isn't the main selling point, it's just the luscious visuals of Pandora that are amazingly brought to life in this movie.The story itself is quite good, not hugely imaginative, but good enough.But mostly I just can't believe people would give this one star. This film doesn't deserve it.",8,5,10,9 January 2010
The Artist," Nice, but nothing special
","If I had to describe this film in one word it's 'nice'. Charming, warm, enjoyable are three more words.But it's really nothing special.My key problem is that there's no twist really to the movie. Otherwise it's a silent movie for silent movie's sake. And sure it's a nice change of pace, and reminds of us of film's rich history, but if you're just largely copying what was before then... what are you bringing to the table other than reviving an old format? At one point the main character has a dream, where he can hear things. And we the viewers hear things too. And this is where I thought the movie was going to really pick up. Almost a Pleasantvillesque slant... I thought it was going to be dealing with how he was self aware that he was silent and would then break into sound. As we hear a laugh for the first time in the film, it really is a magical moment after so much silence. I thought we may go on this journey as he discovers sound, or something to that effect.But then... it drops that, goes back to telling a story... and nothing new is brought to the table.It really is a nice movie, somewhat refreshing... but I don't come away feeling I've witnessed a masterpiece or something that will even remain with me for very long.",6,4,11,24 February 2012
War of the Worlds," No redeeming qualities
","I normally see some good in any movie, but really... I honestly can't find any with this. I couldn't even watch it all, which is again rare for me as I'll normally suffer through a film just so I've seen it.Cruise and Spielberg's previous collaboration, Minority Report, was a brilliant piece of work for both of them. Why they came together to do this piece of tripe is beyond me.Where do I start? The main thrust of this story is that some people want to get from point A to point B. To me, that's not good drama. The world is being destroyed, and getting to Boston is the overriding theme. The theme of survival is secondary to this, and that' just ridiculous.Everything is so by the numbers. Cruise plays the typical American hero in this film: an ordinary guy, trying to be a good father, who becomes a hero. People (like news reporters) don't mind stopping and filling him in because he is The Hero. So clichéd.There is never a sense of real emotional depth or a feeling of impending destruction. I mean, the world is being destroyed and we have time to spend talking about peanut better sandwiches and toilet breaks. It doesn't add realism, it detracts from it.Attempts at humor are blatant, and could only have been more blatant if they put up a note instruction people to laugh. The moment where the son asks if the machines have come from Europe just gave me this vision of the writers sitting there, tittering, marvelling as their own comic genius as they wrote the line.There were vague moments where the film seemed to try and capture a little 9/11, the fallback idea of the lazy writer these days. Dakota Fanning having to ask if it's terrorists attacking, and people turning on each other to get a car, seemed liked desperate attempts to add some grit. It fails.I also have to make special mention a moment when Cruise's character and his two kids are speeding along a road, dodging between cars. I don't know what was worst here: the fact that they don't wear seat belts while hurtling along at god knows what speed, that Cruise's acting is just plain bizarre, or the cringe-worthy moment of the brother calming down the sister like she's a neurotic adult. It's a shame when a small kid is being bred into problems of adulthood, needing 'space' or whatever other barmy self-help book stuff they were embodying her character with.All in all, worthless. Really. The effects were appallingly blatant CGI, the acting was poor, the writing was poor. No artistic or unique merit. I think they only positive thing I can say on a final note is that the DTS soundtrack was quite good at times. But that's not enough of a reason to watch this stinker.Get Minority Report instead for a better Cruise/Spielberg collaboration, and if you want humans in danger then I think that even Deep Impact does a lot better job.",1,5,9,26 November 2005
Mother!," Enertaining, but not greater than the sum of its parts
","I was rarely bored in this film, and it was certainly intriguing. From a mood and direction level it was superb - off kilter and very claustrophobic. Acting talent was excellent. But... when you are led on a weird and wonderful journey, you need a bit more. The ending kind of summed up what was obvious from the start anyway - but I was looking for the next level, the revelation that would tie it together and provide something that raised it above its parts.Sadly it didn't. So while the ride was interesting, the destination was not. Sadly I can't recommend it for that reason. It will be very forgettable as it never stood for anything in particular.",6,0,5,17 September 2017
Cloud Atlas," An unparalleled triumph
","There are few films that leave me with a feeling that will remain with me for a long time, but this has done it.It is rare to meet a story that speaks so well for the human condition... that asks who we are, what motivates us, and what links us together.This film will speak to people who like me often sit there and think of different times, the Roman era to name just one example, and think what were the people like? What motivated them? How in all their fears and inadequacies was there someone just like me sat in this same region hundreds of years ago thinking the same thing.Cloud Atlas takes that, wonderfully, with interleaved stories that stand on their own merits but have common threads.There are connections between the stories - much like someone could write a book 2000 years ago and now people follow it as if it were unquestionably true - about how things can influence the future. But aside from these small connections they are separate stories. They are not meant to be A + B = C. They are meant to portray commonalities.The actors being reused works but also fails a little too. It perhaps at times tries to draw the narrative together a little too much. And some of the makeup and character choices are questionable (men as women, women as men and Asians that look like Vulcans). And this is the only reason I drop it a point - because it's hard for any film to be 10/10. Occasionally it snaps you out of the movie, but thankfully rarely.I see some people have rated this 1/10 which to me is offensive. I appreciate that it may not be to everyone's taste; but the effects. The acting. The scope. Something warrants it to be the worst possible rating. But perhaps I'm not surprised. Some people in this world will contribute nothing. This masterpiece of direction, music, acting, special effects and locations by wonderfully talented people is worth the bottom rating of 1/10, but their 5 minute review is their 'contribution' to us. But it's nothing. They will die, and their words will be forgotten.But some people stand for something. Make a mark, either on some one, or some thing... through standing against inequality, or creating beauty. And they will echo on. This is a story for all those people that have made the life we live today, and all those that will make a mark for years to come. And that is Cloud Atlas.",9,2,4,18 August 2013
