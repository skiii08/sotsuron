Black Swan," BLACK SWAN
","In the psychological melodrama of director Darren Aronofsky Black Swan, the film tells the story of ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman), beautiful, weak, naive and on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to her floundering in the double character performance in the Swan Lake Ballet. Nina, a kind and fragile girl, is undoubtedly ideal for the role of White Swan, but the director of the work Thomas (Vincent Castle), doubts about her ability to embody the role of the Black Swan, he pretends that she can master the technique of dance and not feeling.
Nina, who has dedicated her life to ballet, has years of striving for perfection, years of physical and mental training that take you away from normal life. In the art of ballet, its performance is represented by the illusion of triumph over reality or even victory over gravity and this struggle between idealism and reality consumes it completely, especially since we feel that this was not necessarily her choice but the most reality she found herself in. Her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), was a ballerina once and once, and now all her life is about pursuing her daughter's career and living together in a small apartment.
Together they spend time talking like sisters and yet she feels that something is wrong.
The main storyline of the 'Black Swan' is traditional: what happens behind the scenes, competition and artistic jealousy, but Aronowsky takes these elements and takes us on a frightening journey from within Nina's mind that seems to start confusing the boundaries of reality and illusion. This perception is evident to us at the beginning of the film with dream scenes (literally) to intersect with the dream of a ballerina's life in fact, so it is fair to see that the film is about fear, love and hate, fear of failure, fear of being let down by your body, fear of ignoring, perfect love. The fear of causing disappointment to the woman she loves - her mother - and she also hates her deep hatred is the cause of everything that happens.",9,1,1,13 January 2020
