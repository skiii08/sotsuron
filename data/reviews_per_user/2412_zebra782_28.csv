The Sound of Music," The Mother of all Musicals !!
","What do we really need to make a good musical ? lovely songs, great fun, dazzling performances, what else ? every thing you need in good film and more is here in this classic.it seemed then like there is no better choice for any musical than Julie Andrews, her voice is not normal, i had to close my eyes every time she sang because you don't hear this with your ears you only hear it with your brain........magical!!!! Christopher Plummer is also quit a singer.And with a great film maker like Robert Wise you can't get bored at all even though the film is a bit long but it was fun.This is the Greatest of the Great.",8,3,11,4 January 2008
Finding Neverland," A salute to the great Depp
","This is the most emotional and inspirational movie i have ever seen recently.The great Johnny Depp delivered a first class performance in every aspect, i liked his accent, you would not believe he is an American if you do not know him.Kate Winslet is magnetic as usual, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell were in there best shapes to do such a beautiful job.The score, oh.. my god, not even John Williams or Hans Zimmer could have composed a better music, it is just fitting perfectly with every scene, truly Oscar winner.one more last thing,the talented born Freddie Highmore, he left me in heavy tears at the end of the movie, i wish i knew where did he get all that natural talent, a bright future is ahead of that kid.This is a MUST see movie for all ages, for all times.",10,0,0,21 July 2007
12 Angry Men," Just watch the first 30 minutes of it and you'll put it far away on the very top of your list!!!
","And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.And that line 'well, so long' stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.This film is a symbol of simple but great film-making that suggests a man should always return to his senses every time and every where.10/10",10,18,29,3 February 2008
Beauty and the Beast," One of the most romantic films ever !!
","And i mean that: this is a romance that you can't find any where, just in fairy tales and myths.I think the dancing scene is one of the most beautiful scenes in the history of cinema, combined with a dazzling music what else could we ask for.the animation adaptation is fantastic and Disney has always been great when it comes to animation.i really think that this movie deserved an Oscar nomination for best picture, for it will be doomed as i said one of the most romantic films ever.",9,2,2,17 November 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Oh my God, Silly Academy, what the hell have you done?
","How on earth did Brokeback Mountain ended up not wining the best picture Oscar, I would've preferred Good Night and Good Luck, or Walk the Line, but not Crash, my point is that Brokeback Mountain is absolutely the best picture of 2005 without a tiny doubt.Regardless of the gay thing the story is very romantic and moving, I never thought that Heath Ledger can actually act that good, neither Jake Gyllenhaal nor Michelle Williams. They were all great, and definitely Oscar worthy performances, but they have to thank the master, Ang Lee, I don't think that Scorsese or Spielberg could've done any thing near that perfection of Ang Lee's.He portrayed a gay romance story to be one of the most remarkable love stories in the history of all cinema, with a decent look and purely direction orientation.And just for the record, please and from a cinematic point of view put Brokeback Mountain against Crash and scale in every aspect, and tell me which is better.",10,24,27,7 September 2007
Juno," Juno is a Tornado!
","I saw Juno just yesterday and it blew my mind, it swept away every drama\comedy i've seen in the last 2 or 3 years and i think it will stay with me for a long time. i was laughing till the end of the movie, it is simply undescribable, one of the very best of the year 2007.Jason Reitman did an unbelievable job, i think he deserved his academy award nomination and this is the least he should've got for this great achievement.Ellen Page, oh my god that (monkey little butted) TALENTED actress, she is (NATURAL BORN ACTRESS) and Jason Reitman helped her to give the performance of her short but bright career which is expected to get much successful.This script is the most original script ever written for the screen it so smart that i think it will be as one of the greatest ever written.this film is a winner and i was so glad to hear that it got 4 Oscar nomination with congratulations in advance for Diablo Cody for his masterpiece.9/10",8,1,5,6 February 2008
Lost in Translation," There is something about the Coppola's ,this film is just about perfect!!
","I am so sorry I had to watch this film about three times to discover the brilliance it carries within; at first I thought 'oh god, this is another ordinary rom/com' but no this is no ordinary film, IT IS FUNNY AS HELL AND REALISTIC AS LIFE IT SELF.The casting is terrific and the fact that Bill Murray got an Oscar nomination was not a surprise for me considering he has done a brilliant job with Scarlett Johansson under the supervision of the beautiful Sofia Coppola.The film about a man (Murray) who came to Tokyo to do some whiskey commercials and a newly wedded bride (Johansson) who met in the most extraordinary circumstances made the entertainment headlines in the year 2003; the film that witnessed the birth of Johansson's talent collected about 44 million Dollars in the US box office, which is a huge success for little film that didn't cost more than 10 million dollars.And After I watched it for the third time I said to my self 'GOOD GOD, am I that stupid not to notice the brilliance of this gem, it is really something', this film is just not lucky being produced the same year as the great the return of the king.Now are you guys interested in such film making? Ask the Coppola's there is something about them.9/10",9,1,6,3 February 2008
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Jones..... Iam in love with you
","Have you seen how Renee can master the British accent, she was just terrific, I am telling you, ain't no body can do that except a very few very talented actors and actresses like Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp and Cate Blanchett.I don't know if she deserved or did not deserve the Oscar nomination but with the extra pounds of weight gained and the adorable accent and the absolutely amazing performance something should've happened.The rest of the cast made the movie very funny and the fight scene, oh my god it was hilarious, and we were out of control.I am afraid that I have nothing to say but this, Bridget JonesÂ….. I am in love with you, thank you very mush.",7,0,1,10 September 2007
The Aviator," Scorsese's best ? i don't think so, Di Caprio's Best? Indeed!!!
","Martin Scorsese is taking the art of film direction to another level (hey, guys this is my personal point of view please respect it! ;) ), no director on earth can get the best of Leonardo DiCaprio better than Scorsese.The art direction is amazing in every aspect, the editing the cinematography even the costumes, are calling the academy awards.let us now talk about the acting,Leonardo DiCaprio is dazzling as Howard Hughes the godfather of the aviation industry in America in the first half of the 20th century, he performed superbly the phsycological side of Hughes's life, a well deserved Oscar nomination, thank god he won a golden globe for that role, because it would have been totally unfair for him not to win a major award for such a magnificent performance. Cate Blanchett, is Katharine Hepburn the academy award winning actress, once a girlfriend of Howard Hughes,Cate Blanchett is simply magnetic,she really is the queen of the scene,her presence is lighting the film, i have never been convinced by an Oscar wining role as much as i was convinced by this role(alongside her is Jennifer Connelly in A BEAUTIFUL MIND). the rest of the supporting cast were all amazing, Alan Alda as the embarrassed Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, was truly amazing. this film is maybe the best of Martin Scorsese so far even better than good fellas. and the crew worked with him were very smart.thank you all for this masterpiece.",9,1,2,21 July 2007
Burn After Reading," Tense, Brilliant.
","To say that this film is Brilliant is the least to say about it, god i am so lucky i had a chance to see this.every thing about it is so great the characters, the acting, and of course the screenplay, it's funny, bloody violent and surprisingly very thrilling, i just wish to know how on earth did the Coens come up with this mess? unbelievable.the stars of show are: 1- Malkovich: a veteran scene stealer, he is still got it and the Coens helped him delivering one of his most brilliant performances in a long time.2- Clooney: oh my god he is just a natural, no need to tell him what to do at all, just tell him what to say and leave the rest to him, you'll be really amazed.the rest of the cast are also good, with a special note to Brad Pitt, this is the funniest i've ever seen him.i didn't expect much from the Coens, hell i didn't expect them to even make another movie this year after their big party last year with (No Country for old Men) i thought they would take a rest for year or two celebrating with their Oscar statues before making such a light production but they did it and they did it fine, really fine.",7,2,7,28 October 2008
The Village," Very Beautiful,mainly because of Bryce Dallas Howard's performance and Shyamalan's imagination !!
","M. Night Shyamalan sure has a beautiful mind to come up with this beautiful film, the rare idea of a 19's century people still living in the new millennium, that idea blew my mind.the most interesting thing is the new talent Bryce Dallas Howard, she is charming and magnetic and i think she was the centre of the movie, and if she is making her debut with a director like Shyamalan; then you guys should look that girl up in the next few years, she is gonna grab an Oscar.the rest of the cast did not disappoint me, i mean this is a fantastic film making.The romance touch in the movie was very sweet, and even there were some breathtaking scenes :which i don't like: but the outcome was a simple extraordinariness.",9,1,4,20 October 2007
Being John Malkovich," Propably the most complex analytical movie i've ever seen
","Yes it is, and if you want to watch this movie and understand it you have to be in a good mood, because this 'stuff' is really good, and it touch's your personality very deep inside body and mind.Spike Jonze is one great film director, no wonder why he got the Oscar nomination, he portrayed with the brilliant writer Charlie Kaufman the personality of John Malkovich as some thing you can feel as if it was a car you can ride or a shirt you can wear, that bizarre idea blew my mind.the acting was great and i liked Cameron Diaz in particular, for me she deserved an Oscar nomination, she was simply sensational.but after all it's not very complex, i received the message immediately after the movie and it said don't be John Malkovich or any one else, just be your self.",8,1,2,4 November 2007
Ratatouille," Having a bad day ?! see Ratatouille, it'll fix it.
","I never thought i would give a 10/10 to an animation; but i dare and i challenge to say this : this is the best animation ever made in the history of animation.the visuals are STUNNING !!!! every time we expected something from pixar it was good but Ratatouille just went way beyond expectations, with a sweet touch of humanity and romance and ofcource that touch of the little chef, i felt like being in Paris for a long ,long time i think this movie will set new borders for the entire film industry, not only in animation but in motion pictures as well, it is a technology from another time.so if you are in bad mood or just having a bad day, see this movie. it will save the rest of your day.you know what, do you have a girlfriend and you want to empress her with your taste; just take her to see this movie, and i am pretty sure she will fall for you.what a movie !!!!",10,2,5,21 October 2007
Gandhi," Richard Attenborough = The impossible is nothing
","Honestly this maybe the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life so far, smartly written and brilliantly directed, this is now is going to be on the top of my list.I think Richard Attenborough had been studying the Indian culture and history for a long long time before he could ever think about producing such movie, and I think it worth the waiting because the outcome was extraordinary.Ben Kingsley gave one hell of an Oscar worthy performance, the best in his career no doubt, but what amazed me was the supporting cast, they were amazing, and I don't understand not a single Oscar nomination went for them.I think the positive charisma of Gandhi over his people was the most important factor in the huge success of this movie, and it will be a classic all over the world.",10,0,2,15 September 2007
American History X," An excellent film
","A good director and a good script helped Edward Norton delivering the performance of his lifetime.The film is smartly dealing with racism as a disease cracking the community body,Edward Norton well deserved Oscar nominated performance was amazing,his emotions were knocking on the screen.Edward Furlong, i have never seen him in any other movie before but he was amazing too.This is one of the movies that i have watched once but at the end of it i quickly made my mind about it.A great piece of work.",9,0,2,21 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," GOOD GOD !!! He really is the ultimate bad ass !!!!!
","The Coen's Really came up with a sensational sense of crime that is at least to be described as fearless, and Javier Bardem did that job wonderfully, a 100% Oscar worthy performance.Another thing about this movie is that there is no musical score at all i mean nothing and that is why you have to stand on your toes the whole time, Absolutely brilliant.Nonetheless like they said i am not sure i quit liked the last 20 minutes of it simple because ..... well justice was not served, it should have been more mature than that, any way Fargo was better in this point, it gave satisfaction to simple viewers.However, the film is really great acting directing and film making which i assume it will put it among the front runners for the Oscars next month.9/10",9,2,6,2 January 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Unbelievable film making
","I haven't seen a movie like this truly in a long long time, one of the most powerful yet emotional movies I've ever seen.1- The visuals are stunning and this is for the cinematography in particular, it was so beautiful. 2- The acting was rather good, the actors managed to show their emotions very well under the supervision of the master Ang Lee.3- The art direction and the costumes were stunning; I think the best in the year 2000.4- And the musical score, OH MY GOODNESS, it was magical; with the combination of Chinese and Eastern music the composer came up with something unbelievably beautiful.5- Now combine all that with a fantastic adapted screenplay and a brilliant director who did an absolutely great job.The greatness of this film comes from its simplicity, life was simple back then so is the movie, and I don't agree with those who criticized the movie about the flying people, because it is a part of the Chinese culture, and oh my god it is a beautiful culture.",10,3,5,13 September 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Perfect for kids !!
","I would be very proud and satisfied to take the kids to watch this enjoyable movie without being concerned about any ideas that might carried aside by this kind of movies.I loved the songs and the musical score very much and i couldn't bare that Danny Elfman didn't receive an Oscar nomination for that dazzling non-stop fantastic music, he is really a musical master singing writing and scoring.Tim Burton has a dark Gothic imagination but the orientation was purely kind, the characters of the movie were so typical yet very enjoyable for the kids.Again this brilliant movie is a stuff that goes ahead of its time, great visuals, and the cinematography was magnificent.This Movie is a real classic.7/10",7,1,1,10 November 2007
Big Fish," Fantastic adaptation, very touching
","When I began watching the movie I thought it is just another ordinary comedy, but surprisingly it was mush more than that.The director did a very good job trying to reveal his ideas of life and love. The acting was rather good either, and Billy Crudup in particular was magnificent. Actually the only movie I saw for Billy was Almost Famous and maybe he was good but in Big Fish he was someone else, his acting is so sweet and gentle yet powerful and very emotional.The screenplay was amazing; it really is a one of a kind story about life,death, joy, love and family.And the most interesting thing is the non-stopping music by the genius Elfman from start to finish; it is fitting perfectly with every scene. Well deserved academy award nomination.This is really a very rich experience that is not to be missed.",8,1,1,31 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Simlpy undescribable, this is the film that defined the term 'Box Office' !!
","without doubt this is Stanley Kubrick's Best, and i think i am a little silly right now writing about this masterpiece, but i couldn't help it, i mean i had to because i watched it last night and i am still thinking about it now and i think i will be thinking about it for several days.If Kubrick was thinking about making a sequel for Dr.Srangelove then he made a sequel that is as good as the Godfather part II, it is about man vs. machine the first round the nuclear bomb knocked up man but then in this film man maintained his position as the highest creature in the universe, the scene of Dave unplugging the memory and the computer begging him not to was one of the most emotional scenes in the history of cinema.And tell me about the spectacular visual effects, that was stunning, i could easily believe this is the stuff of the year 2001, and what amazed me that the man who did the visuals was Stanley Kubrick himself and better yet he won an Oscar for that.By the end of the film Kubrick's managed to get every one thinking about the core of life and how weak and simple a human bean is, and when you think the film is getting boring, you will discover it is not.On the contrary,this film is very very fun to watch not only for adults but the visuals are attracting the kids as well, and i think if it wasn't for this movie there will not be anything as 'box office'.This is an immortal masterpiece for all ages until the end of time.10/10",10,1,5,7 December 2007
Pride & Prejudice," An absolutely magnificent debut for Joe Wright for my Jane Austin's favorite novel!!!
","I fell in love at first sight with this film, I liked every thing about it, and that way my heart beats faster every time I see Keira Knightley; she proved that she is a really talented actress and that nomination in that very particular time gave her career a great boost.The cinematography is absolutely perfect and this is why I liked this film, it gives you that great feeling of the British country in 19th century, and how about a brief presence of Judi Dench, oh god this is just what I needed, it is about perfect.And better yet considering that this is a debut for Joe Wright I think he has just revealed himself as the filmmaker to be watched.9/10",8,2,7,3 February 2008
Les MisÃ©rables," The running time of this film should be cut short to exactly 43 minutes...!!!
","Too long, too boring, alright, alright the artistics were great but these things are common in every film shooting for the awards,though the acting was good, this is the best i've seen from Hugh Jackman yet, however the real show stealer was Anne Hathaway.Such a short and memorable cameo it reminds me of the greatest supporting roles ever, she is gonna take the home a little statue, that's for sure! But after Anne's character dies in the film, i found no reason to continue watching, just piles over piles of boring music and singing, just not worth the time.while it is worth the watch for Anne's sake, this film is good but not great...!!!",7,0,1,14 January 2013
A Beautiful Mind," Don't tell me you haven't seen this movie, Russell Crowe is unbelievable!
","It is just perfect, every thing is just perfect about this movie, but there is only one thing I couldn't understand, how in the earth did Russell Crowe ended up not winning the Oscar for best actor? This is madness, that was absolutely the best performance ever by Crowe.I think The Hollywood Foreign Press count it right about what happened between Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in 2000 and 2001 awards because 2000 was Washington's year and 2001 was Crowe's year.And have you seen Jennifer Connelly, she was charming and magnetic; her performance was the best ever I have seen by a supporting actress. I can't imagine any other actress for that role but her.The entire supporting cast was fantastic in every aspect, and Ron Howard did absolutely fantastic job, it really is a masterpiece.",9,1,3,4 August 2007
The Holiday," It looks like a fairy tale, but still very sweet
","First of all I would like to say something to Nancy Meyers, allow me: your are the goddess of the comedy/romance genre, your movies has that very particular romantic feeling that makes me want to take of this earth and fly away to be with the characters of your movies.The story of The Holiday looks like a fairy tale, love failures and home exchanging at the same time, it is a serendipity, then comes the unpredictable; the unseen love in the most unexpected sweetest way, imagine two lovers falling in love quickly and madly, but they are facing a separation, there is no need to scream and cry, all they need is a little bit of sense, reasonably they decided to meet soon or stay together for the sake of their newly born love, that is exactly what happened in the movie, and that is exactly what I loved about it.About the acting a liked Kate Winslet, she was so beautiful and painfully funny, Jude was so handsome and Cameron was so sexy, but the surprise package was Jack Black, he proved me that he is a really good actor, and the presence of Eli Wallach; which I think was a brilliant idea; was a very refreshing thing, by the way he is still in a good shape.Like I said it looks like a very impossible fairy tale, but still sweet like no other and funny as hell, really good stuff.",6,2,4,17 October 2007
American Gangster," It's not about Russel Crowe nor Denzel Washington, it's all about Ridley Scott
","In my opinion I think American Gangster is one of Ridley Scott's finest works if not the best, well, some thing very bad already happened to this movie though, it is Martin Scorsese's The Departed winning last year best picture and best director in particular on the same kind of work.I think Ridley Scott has already booked a spot in the best director contest, he can control the camera like no other, you can get every teeny tiny detail from what your are watching thanks only to him, he managed to get some details about a very critical period of the American history using a very descent manner focusing on drugs and society, I gotta say I never heard of Frank Lucas before but as you are watching you can get that feeling of knowing him for a long time. And by the way the film editing was great too. The acting was fantastic, Denzel Washington is really a bad ass guy, but deep inside he is a good hearted family man, showing that when dealing with his wife, his brothers and his mother, he was really great, however Russel Crowe was controlled by the role he played, this role is a recipe for a great supporting role; being a confused cop who can't focus on his job because of his family; but I don't think Russel Crowe was prepared enough for supporting roles, nonetheless he did a very fine job.Saying that I don't think the actors performances will get Oscar nominations, instead I think two persons in particular could get nominations:Steven Zaillian: for his sharp and smart script. And of course Ridley Scott for this great achievement.Although the drug matter has become a usual subject lately but Ridley Scott can always come up with something new about every movie he direct.10/10",8,3,11,29 October 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Anthony Hopkins like no other !!!!
","I have never seen acting like Anthony Hopkins's in this movie, he was simply superb, his eyes were like shining diamonds, one moment I though he is going to get me, oh my god I was so scared.Jodie Foster did a fantastic job too, her emotions were knocking on the screen, a well deserved Oscar winning roles for Anthony and Jodie.The screenplay was amazing too, and the director did his best in turning this novel into an unforgettable masterpiece combining drama with horror+thrill.the rest of the supporting cast were fantastic too, and this is for Ted Levine in particular.Though I am not a fan for the horror but I liked it very much.",8,1,2,15 August 2007
AmÃ©lie," The Bafta awards gave this french masterpiece the justice it deserved.
","I am still not satisfied though, because Amelie is the best romantic comedy I have seen in my life, it is even better than most of the well known classic romantic comedies (roman holiday, Annie hall, pretty womanÂ….etc), and it will be mentioned alongside the greatest romantic epics like Casablanca, out of Africa, the English patient and Titanic.Some one tell me why is foreign movies aren't being nominated for the main academy awards categories (acting, directing, picture), and don't tell me Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because that was once in a life time incident, this is totally unfair, Amelie was all about pure brilliance, the cinematography was terrific and it was one of the main factors in the huge success of the movie, the movie focused not only on the life of Amelie but on the people around her as well in a very unique way, it was like an easy puzzle to solve and the positive look for life from the brilliant writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet gave the movie that great feeling that ended up with it to be in IMDb top 250 (while I am writing this it is now ranked 38).The acting was great and that is for Audrey Tautou as a leading actress and Jamel Debbouze as a supporting actor in particular, for me Audrey Tautou deserved an Oscar nomination; some of you may think I am being ridiculous, but isn't she a good actress? Does it always have to be about screaming and crying in heavy tears to earn a nomination, what is wrong with comedy? Didn't Audrey Hepburn win an Oscar for a role just like Audrey Tautou's nearly 50 years ago, well I gotta say back then the academy had a little bit of sense among its members.And have you guys seen the last 15 minutes of the movie; it was 15 minutes from heaven I mean that was the best romance you can get ever.Thank god the Bafta awards gave this masterpiece the justice it deserved, and you members of the academy just keep your statues for your selves.",10,2,7,23 October 2007
Gangs of New York," 10 Oscar nominations yet not a single win i never heard of such a thing, this film is a winner!!!
","Thank you Marty, you are great as usual but some times life is just unfair, i mean how on earth did this Masterpiece ended up winning no Oscars at all.Daniel Day-Lewis is a fantastic actor no matter being good or being bad and after i saw this it is better for him to take bad personalities always because he nailed his role to the very bone,i believe he created one of the worst villains ever.Lenardo DiCaprio is always good and this is no exception sadly for him the film makers wanted the nomination for Daniel Day-Lewis, and i think it was a good idea.But Cameron Diaz is the shining star here, she is sexy, talented and i think she deserved the golden globe nomination.The rest of the cast were terrific in every sense of the word, and how could't they and they are with Marty; the one and only.With a perfect film making, although the film got 10 Oscar nominations for me it is still underrated.8/10",8,1,2,3 February 2008
