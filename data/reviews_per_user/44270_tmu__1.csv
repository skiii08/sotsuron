Miracle," HMM..very.. American film :) but a decent hockey film.
","I liked the movie.. I guess it was some sort of miracle USA beating USSR in 1980. But does it need to be recorded by a movie ? I guess so..I had only one disappointment about the movie: For Americans, it just might be who-cares-thing.But as the movie progress, and USA beats USSR, and we have the final match (gold final). USA beats Finland 4 - 2 .. OK COOL.. that is what happened (darn so close for Finland! ;) ) . But in the end, at the victory ceremony, suddenly Team Finland mysteriously changed into Team Sweden :D Most probably don't care about mistake like this, but as a Nordic person (most of all, as a Finn) , it was kinda hilarious screw up to be left in the end of this otherwise OK movie .. So it seems, in this movie Team Sweden received silver medals instead of Team Finland .Otherwise, a decent movie. I gave it a Solid eight (7). It is not easy to make good, UNBIASED sport-movie. Especially about hockey.",7,0,5,12 May 2005
