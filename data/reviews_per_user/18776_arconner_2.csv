It," Best Horror Film ever Composed... because it's not a horror film
","This was honestly the best horror film I have ever seen, and I've read the book about nine times through, and I think I know why it is. Because it's not a horror film. Yes, I know, the label says 'horror' and it's based on a horror novel, and I acknowledge that the horror factor was definitely there, but it wasn't a horror film. Hear me out.Horror films never do well in theaters because they try too hard to scare people. If it's not scary, then it sucks; if it's only kinda scary, then it sucks; if it's too scary, then it sucks. It's an endless cycle we've put horror movies into, but notice how 'IT' is getting better reviews than some Marvel movies right now. That's because they never wrote the script to be a horror film.Also notice that the label says 'drama' alongside 'horror'. 'IT' was written to be a comedy with the horror factor always present, thus making it a horror movie like the book and something that appeals to the audience. Hence the constant jokes throughout. This horror film is great because it's not a horror film.Definitely worth seeing in theaters. Twice.",10,6,15,9 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Great Comeback No Matter what Anyone Else Says
","Okay, before I start rambling on about how amazing this movie was, I would first like to say a few words to a select personnel. All of you who voted for a one, or anything four or lower, and wrote your review with how much you thought it sucked, you need to back off. I bet all of you would say that this movie was better than the prequel trilogy by far, but you picked out every bad detail in this movie just to ruin it for others, and yourself. You have to realize that yes, the movies aren't going to be as good as the originals. I hate to break it to you, but Hollywood isn't perfect either, so whatever you have to say that isn't good or is the finest grain of unnoticeable detail that you thought sucked, just keep it to yourself.Now, I would like to say a few words about the movie. It was AMAZING. Sooooo much better than the prequel trilogy and almost as good as the originals. This movie sets the pace, and there is already conformation for another two in this trilogy set.Now I have to say, I really do hope the trilogy does well, otherwise I will never hear the end of it out of my step-dad. But with how well this first one did, I have no doubt it will only get better from here. So if you're thinking of watching the new movie, I say go ahead. Don't listen to everyone else, we all have our own opinion after all.",10,5,28,19 December 2015
