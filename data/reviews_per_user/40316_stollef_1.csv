3:10 to Yuma," It's Brokeback Mountain II, Ending watered down, Too sensitive for a Western
","The opening and setting up of the story were satisfying and full of promise. The locations are beautiful and the casting loaded with A-list caliber talent, although a bit too soft and pretty looking for a Western. They don't cast tough guys like they used to. Unfortunately the screenwriters abandon the original Elmore Leonard story and the entire movie falls apart in the second half with several surprising but poorly motivated twists and finally an utterly stupid, watered down ending. This film will most probably do badly in the box office. There will be no surprise in that. As a big fan of the Western genre, I fear it will scare big studios away from doing Westerns. That will be too bad.",4,6,18,9 September 2007
