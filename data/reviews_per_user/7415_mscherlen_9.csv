Black Swan," Natalie Portman's weak imitation of Jeff Goldblum as 'The Fly'
","Really, you have got to be joking. I want my 9 dollars back. The movie tried very hard to be artsy, profound and mature, but it ended up like some puberty-infected youth making 'Swan Lake for the Family guy loving acne-faced weirdos' sect. Or maybe it should be billed as 'The Farrelly Brothers attempt Shakespeare. I get it. You like to show vomit. I get it you like to show self-mutilation. I get it, you've discovered lesbian porn. This is the most singularly ham-fisted direction to be set to film from someone that is not in junior high in a century. Not to mention the camera work, which Michael J. Fox could have shot steadier riding a pogo stick. I get it, too, I am supposed to be 'in the scene'. It was like 'riding the Titanic through Katrina' seasickness. The movie could best be described as shooting for the moon, yet barely reaching the gutter.Mila Kunis is one of the most beautiful actresses of the past decade, scorching hot. But even she couldn't save this sad outing. Everything that happens in the film is so amazingly predictable that I burst out laughing thinking it was a spoof. From Natalie Porman's flat character having scratches in the shape of wings to turning into looking like a boiled chicken to literally sprouting feathers (I fell over laughing at this comedy gold but the joke was on the director because I don't think he meant it to be funny, to figuratively laying an egg (or 'turd' with this film, it was all just bad comedy. Hey Natalie, time to pull out another fingernail, the other ones are starting to scab over. And the 'giving it all for the dance' crap is just too trite for words.In a word, I didn't give a poop about the acting. All of the characters were lifeless and half-dimensional. I do admit to being happy that the (SPOILER ALERT, although it could not be shocking to anyone with half a brain) main character dies, because I hope it prevents a sequel. The director would make a good fry cook at McDonalds maybe, but I have no indication he is capable of any other job. The cinematography was weak and the camera-work was atrocious. The mother character was better done in 'Psycho'. The storyline of this little outing was one of the most predictable and lame in all of movie history. All in all, awful, awful, awful, but since it is the holiday season, I will generously give this movie one star (although, by default, any other movie with Natalie Portman or Mila Kunis would get at least four stars just for visual appeal. Waste of talent and beauty).",1,38,90,18 December 2010
Superbad," Holy Amazing This Movie Was Crap!!!!,
","Now I know where all the Will Ferrel fans go when he doesn't have a new movie out. If you want to hear 'Pee-pee' jokes, go teach middle school! Don't pay 8 bucks to watch this movie,'fart-joke' humor should be cheaper. What a disappointment! Michael Cera was great in Arrested Development, but just another boring teenager in this film, with a fat loudmouth Penis lover and a revenge of the nerd type dork for friends. The cop guy from 'knocked-up' should be a arrested for contributing to the delinquency of a Mc Tool. But again a few laughs for a long movie in which I just felt sad that there are actors desperate enough to settle for this tripe. Attention Jim Carey, these guys stole one of your movies. Yes, it's Super Bad.",3,5,11,30 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," Where is the rest of it?
","The Coen brothers could poop on the screen and there are people who would regard it as genius. The movie had some potential, but it wasn't even completed. I guess they just woke up and said, 'I don't feel like finishing this... just tell them we're done... our name alone is enough to sell this as a whole movie'. Well, some of us noticed. I would like to see this thing completed someday, as it started out good, had some decent acting, and the cinematography was bland and washed out like 'The Mist' and 'Delores Claiborne'. What ever happened to Technicolor? Tommy Lee Jones must be Barnaby Jones' older brother that never used sunscreen, because he looks like he died of old age several decades before they invented enbalming fluid... it is no wonder that his character didn't actually do anything but show up after everything was over. The main 'bad guy' really didn't have much to do except 'act' unemotional. He was 'The Terminator' only more robotic. The ending didn't suck; there was no ending. The Coens just quit.",4,19,38,23 December 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Yuk
","I thought that this tripe would never end. The movie was wholly aggravating and I think if I had to hear Casey Affleck snivel one more line, I would have wanted to shoot him too. The show moved at a pace akin to watching ice melt in winter, and nobody had enough acting chops to make you care whether or not they got killed. The cinematography was not bad but if I ever have to look through another distorted window I might have to rob a train, too. This bland fiasco could have been done in three minutes and the impact would not have suffered. By the end of the show I was thinking, 'Kill him already, maybe there will be enough time for me to do something more fun like get a root canal. Brad Pitt wasn't bad in this role, and he really knows how to read a line, but movies are for actors not orators. Somebody in Hollywood owes me nine bucks.",1,25,59,28 September 2007
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Impossible- Getting my money's worth...
","Wow, this is one of the boring films of the cold war era... even though it was made 25 years after.Really, 'the Russians?' Secret launch codes on paper? Thank God they haven't invented thumb drives, email, or computers, or this movie would be ridiculous. 1980 called, and it wants it's script back.OK, let me get this right... Tom can jump off a building onto a moving car, but he can't climb down a wall to get the suitcase with 'THE BIG RED BUTTON'? He has to risk his life by crashing a car to the ground instead? Oh, Kay...And let me get this straight... he is like James Bond, but his gadgets don't work? Seeems like those super secret spies would check the batteries on their magic gloves, but I guess not. And let me see, Tom Cruise as James Bond drives a BMW-made Prius with neon lights, but it doesn't do anything (except maybe cement Tom's super macho image as a Prius driver). And Simon Pegg uses a magnetic levitating skateboard... but it doesn't work well either. Oh yeah, but at least they had a Magic screen to break into the Kremlin with... oh wait, it went on the fritz, too.But oh, the cinematography was amazing. I mean after all they were in Dubai at one of the World's grandest buildings. Wow, what a great time for close-ups and small shots to help discard the grandeur of the location.THis movie works best as a tribute to all real action movies, lazily borrowing ideas from the Bourne Series, the Bond Series, Looney Tunes, and every lame cop type show from Jag to CSI-wherever, to NCIS, and every action movie from when Tom Cruise was a Star. With a cavalcade of unimportant characters (Simon Peggg I get, he just likes to have fun even though he is great in things he controls, but I guess Jeremy Renner must have lost a best or blown all his cash from the good movies he has been in... because he wasn't necessary here. Oh and the ladies in the film were like the scattered decorations in a Michael Jackson video... cute but not believable.Tommy, you owe me 8 bucks...",4,3,10,3 January 2012
The Mist," Finally, something different
","I just caught the premiere of this movie, and had heard nothing about it other that it was scary. Don't let anybody tell you anything, and run to the closest theater as soon as possible! Yes, there was some barely average acting by Thomas Jane, and the whiny kid, but Marcia Gay Harden chewed up the scenery as the Fundamentalist doom-sayer Ms. Carmody! Go see it just for her if nothing else. It was great fun to actually be at the movies where the audience reacts and rolls with the punches for a change. I recommend finding the loudest, most crowded theatre available. There were a few monster movie clich√©s and stereotypes, some undeveloped threads and a few dumb actions by the characters, but great fun overall. I saw some IMDb users wanting to know the end of the movie, but avoid those losers at all costs! If you end up not liking the movie, I'm sure there is an Adam Sandler movie right around the corner with your name on it.",8,3,11,20 November 2007
The Dark Knight," Holy bat pablum, it's overrated!
","It's an OK movie, but it shot for the stars and hit the footlights. Yeah, Heath Ledger is dead and it's a shame that there is one less drug addict in the world, but, that doesn't mean that this was the best performance ever filmed, with that grating fake-y voice it seemed that he was acting the part, not ever becoming it. I really did like his take on the role however, as it was a fresh take on an old role, but still, he is no Cesar Romero. Having Christian Bale as Batman was an error in casting as well, not that he couldn't look the part, but with that constant effeminate lisp when he talks (and yet, Two Face is missing half his lips and can speak clearly), he made Burt Ward's version of Robin look like vintage John Wayne. Now we know why he chooses to save when he is forced to make a choice. Maggie Gyllenhall is a decent actress, but is no leading lady. To pretend that Batman could find her attractive is really stretch fantasy even in this fantasy based popcorn movie. Even that horrible movie Catwoman had the sense to give us Hallie Berry in Vinyl. I know the movie was supposed to be deep and psychological, and I'm sure research on the motivation of the characters even included reading the dust-jacket to some college Psych 101 class, but it definitely fell short in the compelling and deep sections. The cinematography was really nice for most of the movie but even it could not work magic on the lame fight scenes, or the CGI crap of the Batguy hang gliding between buildings. Hell you were in Hong Kong, couldn't you stop by Jackie Chan's place for a little choreography help? The score to the movie sounded great but was instantly forgettable. Dany Elfman did the Simpson's, why not let him work magic on this cartoon, too? Finally the bat-car sucked! Lets see, put the tires up front, because they'll never get shot out there, even if it does make the Bat mini-van look buck-toothed. That's OK though, if they do shoot out one of the tires, there is a fifty percent chance it won't be the one attached to the bat-moped. At last we find the bat man is the Dark night because he beats his mom, and still maintains a sibling rivalry with his sister. I guess the bat-dude hasn't really evolved at all.",6,5,10,24 July 2008
The Happening," Gimme my money back... Arrrgh! run poison ivy!
","Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. I think Andy Warhol made a long movie in which a guy just slept, I'm sure it had more action. From what little I got out of the so called movie, a retarded lady gets text messages from someone... but why anybody would text a retarded brain dead (ok she was cute, but a date with a corpse would be more interactive and less pitiful, not to mention the corpse could probably act better) moron is unfathomable. Anyway evidently Marky Mark likes her too, but is so concerned that bees are dying that he is unable to notice that he is infected with a disease that paralyzes his face into one expression in the movie where his face has a wrinkled brow and an open mouth. It also evidently paralyzes that part of the brain which allows acting.The rest of the movie is even worse, and so stupid, moronic, unfeasible, pathetic, uninteresting, unengrossing, did I say stupid? that I won't insult anyone by going into it... you wouldn't think I was telling the truth, it is that stupid. m knight sham-a-lot, you owe me ten bucks. The only terror of the movie is wasting money on this tripe, and being stupid enough not to leave three minutes into it. PLEASE Don't WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY IT ONLY ENCOURAGES THEM.WORST...MOVIE...EVER.",1,4,9,22 June 2008
The Ugly Truth," If you are a self-loathing single woman, its your cup of tea
","I do not understand how women will allow Hollywood to portray themselves as such mindless, bitchy twits, in rehashed, degrading tripe such as this. No self-respecting lady should stand idly by as this movie frames woman-kind as this by the numbers, way too rehashed Kate Heigl mindless hag. Have some self respect. At least Gerared Butlers' character was too vanilla to even be a stereotype. There was not an original thought in the whole of this movie. I saw the restaurant scene coming from a mile away, as I recognized it from When Harry met Sally (a movie where Meg Ryan's character was at least allowed to think!). The only differences were: 1. Meg Ryan's Character used her IMAGINATION (evidently, the writers in TUG have never even heard of the word)instead of power tools, 2. Meg Ryan's character was in control of the situation, and didn't submit to being pleasured by a little boy. On a related note, when Katherine Heigl received the 'Present' of 'vibrating underwear' from Gerard Butler's 'character' (or lack thereof) did anyone one else notice that the box it came in was worn and 'used-looking'? EWWW! What king of nasty skank would accept or even worse, a use second-hand masturbation device? It says a lot that the 'actress' would allow her character to be portrayed that way. Well, at least there was no acting wasted on this tripe... honestly, the show played out like someone reading a worn -out script aloud for the first time. Even worse, the make-up 'artist' managed to make Katherine Heigl look EVEN Older than she really is... which is especially a pity, because her character might have worked a little bit if she was supposed to be 14 or younger, but a mature woman in her 60s would hopefully have more intelligence, poise dignity and respect for herself.What a pity of a movie.",1,12,24,5 August 2009
