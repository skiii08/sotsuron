The Rock," My alltime favorite movie
","I admit, this is not the best movie I have ever seen.  I do think, though, that it is the most entertaining mix of action, comedy, suspense, and drama possibly ever put on film.  Sean Connery was fantastic in it, even using some lines that were puns on him.  Nicolas Cage, who was, at the time, just making a name for himself as an action star, and was fresh off his oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, is also great as a highly intelligent, but kind of geeky chemical wizard forced into a 'combat situation'.  I would recommend this movie to just about anyone, because there is something for everybody to like about it.",10,1,1,2 March 2001
