Hereditary," Brace Yourself...Really!!!
","I wasn't ready for what I experienced. Overtaken by uncomfortableness and intrigue, I continued down the rabbit hole. Please pay attention to EVERYTHING. I promise you won't figure out the ending until you drive off. New found respect for horror flicks.",6,1,5,10 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Hot Garbage Would Be Generous
","Imagine a movie where the actors lazily spoke lines and joked every 3 seconds. Well get ready for lame, lame lame! This movie was so bad, I contemplated leaving after the first 15 minutes. Instead I read IMDb reviews should have do this prior. Thor Ragnarok is more predictable than a Donald Trump impeachment. I wasted 2 hours sitting through a god awful impromptu play that will torment right-thinking individuals. Can only pray JLA restores my faith. MCU stole my hard earned money. Don't get robbed. Please stay home!!!",1,22,44,5 November 2017
A Quiet Place," John Krasinski has left The Office...
","A heartbreaking family love story you won't soon forget!!! The movie gets real as life. So don't expect a some happy ending. I can appreciate an earnest flick that doesn't get too wrapped up in pleasing everyone. Most of the audience would have been eaten by whatever the hell these blind creatures are. I nudged the stranger sitting next to me, because the anticipation was thick AF. Millicent Simmonds is an odd duck with a cute little nose who plays the daughter. I hark back to old school scary flicks tapping into children protagonists. Try keeping quiet. I dare you!!!",7,1,3,7 April 2018
Parasite," We're All Parasites..
",The title caught me off guard..is it a horror film? Suspense? Not fully knowing what to expect..sets up Parasite perfectly! I was reminded what quality film making and storytelling was about. Each scene layer on top of the next like a fitted-suit. You connected with each character as if you knew them. Plot twists and turns smorgasbord built to a thunderous crescendo. The movie is deep! We're all parasites..using the class above or below. Korea's changing the game.,10,5,7,8 April 2020
