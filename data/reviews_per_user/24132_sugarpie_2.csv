The Blair Witch Project," Oh Mi Gosh.....it is SOO Good!
","Okay, now this was the first Horror movie I'd ever seen in theaters so, maybe I'm a little niave.  But this movie was increadibly freaky.  Now I have seen horror movies, and I think what sets this one apart is, you don't see the blood and guts, and you don't see the killer.  Your imagination has to make up the killer.  And I think that is why some people liked it and others didn't.  If you don't have a huge imagination then of course it's not gonna be freaky.  But I liked it, I thought it was increadible, and even though I know its totally false, I think the brains it took to make this up...its just genius! Totally Great...go see it",Null,1,1,27 August 1999
As Good as It Gets," .....is a fitting title
","How can it get any better? It basically...can't.  I love it! It shows the other side of New York, actually 3 other sides...Gay Painter, Single-mom waitress, and Nerotic...Guy.  These are the sides that many movies fail to show.  And they are great.  Helen Hunt totally deserved the Oscar over Kate Winslet (who was the 'favorite').  Jack Nicholsen is soo freaky in this movie, you wonder where the acting stops and Jack begins.  Greg Kinner was your run of the mill gay painter...with some funky twists and turns along the way.  Cuba Gooding Jr. was HILARIOUS. I was upset when he didn't get another Oscar Nod.  It was just tooo funny.  All other them together make a dynomite ensemble.  I love love love it.",10,1,1,11 September 1999
