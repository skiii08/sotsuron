Scarface," Truly shows Al Pacino can play any role
","On MTV cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie Scarface out of their DVD collection. This may give you an idea that Scarface is a 'gangster movie'. Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. He falls in with the mob group and becomes a well-known drug lord. Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: 'Say hello to my little friend!' is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think about Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate it ***1/2 (out of ****). Definitely a movie you must see. PHENOMENAL.",10,0,1,16 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The first Matrix was 10 times better...
","This doesn't come close to the greatness of the original Matrix. When I was thinking of how spectacular a sequel to The Matrix would be, I was rather disappointed with the outcome of Matrix Reloaded. It seems as if they spent a few weeks throwing this together. Way too much romance and not enough 'Matrix Action'. If you just would die for the Matrix, then you will probably enjoy this movie. However, I wasn't the movie's greatest fan.",5,0,0,16 October 2003
