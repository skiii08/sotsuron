The Ring," Definitely worth watching
","Not since 'The Omen' has a movie disturbed me as this one did.  There was just something about this movie that touched a chord with me.  The night I saw this movie, I remember replaying various aspects of it in my head.  I definitely did not get as much sleep as I had wanted to. However, I get the sense that this is a love/hate kind of movie, with people very polarized in their view points towards it.  This is based not only on the comments posted, but on the fact that my spouse pretty strongly disliked this movie. All I can say is see the movie for yourself, and make your own decision. It's worth it.  However, do yourself a favor, and don't see it on VHS.",8,0,0,14 November 2002
Aliens," Truly Fantastic
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was about ten years old when I saw this movie in the theater with my parents.  I instantly fell in love with it.  This was my favorite movie of all time, until just recently, when it was bumped down a notch by LOTR.  I cannot sing the praise of this movie enough, and so won't bother except to say that this film is superb.The only negative thing I have to say (this is probably what keeps it from being my favorite movie ever), and it involves SPOILERS,
* * * * * * *
is that this movie should have ended about 15 minutes earlier than it did. In my opinion, this movie should have concluded with the destruction of the colony installation.  The final battle, as it appears in the movie, with the heroine and the mother alien is just hokey.  You can tell that it has been artificially set up from the very beginning of the movie, with those silly exoskeletons.  It's so ridiculous, it pains me.  Whenever I watch the movie, I turn it off, before this scene, so as not to ruin it, because everything else is great.End SPOILERS*********
Nonetheless, this is a truly superb movie, and is definitely one of my favorites.  This is a must see.",10,1,2,13 November 2002
