The Blair Witch Project," What in the world were these people thinking?
","the movie is a piece of trash! the camera work is pathetic, the cast stunk, and the point of the movie was stupid! what on earth were these people thinking at all when making this movie? they could have made a documentary about space people that ate the moon away then this.  i am very happy that i didnt go to the theater, because that had to be the worst for the people's eyes with the camerawork being the way it was and the whole theater being dark....just a good thing that i could turn the movie off. now dont get me wrong, i did watch the entire thing, hoping that it would get better and the camera work was only temporary to lead to the effect (**Spoiler**) that the kids were videotaping all they saw and whom they interviewed. but man i was dead wrong, and the fact of there being (**spoiler**) the witch in a small town where she did horrifying things to the people was stupid. i was (**spoiler**) hoping that the witch would reveal herself, so i had an idea what was eating and killing the kids that were dumb enough to follow this thing,but when i didnt even get to see the witch after sitting through all that was the worst ever. the movie is grateful that teens wanted to watch this garbage, because that is what the movies were marketing at.

Saturday Night Fever," the music is great...
","So, john travolta plays the incredibly sexy dancer that glides across club floors performing dance moves. the dance moves are all disco, so if you cant handle the disco era, then this movie is not for you.  But i never really heard that much until after it ended. so the disco music was ok for me. i wouldnt like it, except (**SPOILER**) when the beginning happens and he walks down the street and the bee gees are playing staying alive.  Oh MY god, that is magic.  The girl that he tries to dance with really was extremely annoying, since she had huge dreams and couldnt really accomplish them.  she uses her dreams to rub in what she supposedly has done, and that makes john think about what should and still could be.  after all, he works at the hardware store and blows all his check on the one weekend of dancing disco. he is well known in the club, and is admired by both males and females in the movie.  i thought that could have a significant meaning, showing that you can have popularity and a special talent, but you are all alone when you dont have someone special to share with.  john really starts to show that he needs someone, and clings to the dancer because she shares the dancing gene, and as well as her being attractive to him.  this movie is really, really great, and it really shows that all people have their downfalls and yet still manage to hang on to the disco era.

The Ring," who invented this stuff?
","The ring isnt scary fun, more like overdone.  the only reason that the main character goes searching around for the mystery of the videotape was only because the niece dies.  i, personally, wouldnt have ever gone looking around for a (**SPOILER**) freaky girl in a well.  the acting is too phony for me, and the movie that gives you only 7 days to solve a mystery meant for scooby doo and the gang to solve was complete crap.  was this some sort of art film or something? and also, the lady that (**SPOILER**) had the creepy issues with horses, did she tape this movie and leave it out to express her sorrows?  or a really lame suicide note that outstretched into a hour and a half flick.  i dont really understand why this movie was a huge success at the theatres, since i almost fell asleep in the movie.  that might have happened because i saw this at the 10 show and wanted to experience the 'creepy' side that the critics said there was.  the main character, naomi watts, really shouldve slapped her agent for giving her this role.  she obviously did this for fame, and that was all.  so, one word of warning before you watch this, think really hard for 7 days if you really wanna waste 3.50 at blockbuster.

As Good as It Gets," heres...melvin!
","jack, you outdone yourself in this tearjerking comedy drama mushed all into one movie.  with the awesome performances of the gay artist, helen hunt, and cuba gooding jr., they all sold their parts to the fullest extent. melvin, jack's character, was a grump almost the entire time, until he met and fell madly in love with the waitress that almost always serves him his breakfast. he seems to have his heart in the freezer, and then, when helen comes with breakfast, he sets the heart out and lets it dethaw for the longest time. i found it charming how he tries it so hard to impress her, and even though it isnt that flattering, it kinda is since he is used to doing what he wants to do, not what women want him to do.  the gay artist had to have hit home with the crying, (**SPOILER**)when someone attacks his work and him, leaving him to rely on the support of melvin.  melvin really is a great guy at heart, but has it all bottled inside.  jack does an outstanding job as the hardened soul, who learns to love like beast from beauty and the beast, only jack was not one about appearances.  Love, can be found by all people, cranky and lovable.  this movie really makes love be the best thing on this world. congratulations on a influential movie that changed this girl's views of love!

Shakespeare in Love," Excellent!
","paltrow and fiennes make an outstanding couple from the 1500's, where women are forbidden to act on the stage along with the creative mind of william shakespeare.  fiennes, as shakespeare, delivers an outstanding performance. i cant wait to watch another of his films.  the movie is all about william finding inspiration to continue writing poems and plays, the inspiration is only to be found in a woman.  the only problem is that the woman where the inspiration is drawn from is none other than royalty.  she is (paltrow) already set to marry someone else in exchange for funds.  the two fall in love through the movie, and appear to be similar to romeo and juliet itself. (**SPOILER**)  in the movie, the play to be acted out is romeo and juliet. the story is known all over.  but didnt it seem that romeo was will and juliet was paltrow?  i felt that their love had to be snuck around, and juliet was connected to royalty... it made me think of why he wrote romeo and juilet.  maybe it did connect to his experiences in love, and felt poisoned with the thought of having love in his heart, but yet his love was far away, never to be touched or seen forever.  shakespeare in love is the best movie that displays william shakespeare, and i strongly recommend it. To rent, or not to rent, that is the question?  but not rented is going to be such sweet sorrow.  (A A-)",9,2,4,30 January 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," cartoon craziness!!!
","I watched the show on comedy central on accident one time, and i just couldn't really understand why these 4 kids are always swearing and making fun of political figures and celebrities and smoking pot in the fourth grade! But after I passed that up, I quickly forgot all about that and started to watch it whenever I saw that it came up. Then the movie came out, and I couldn't really figure out what the movie would be about, since it's based on a half hour show. the musical idea is funny, and I couldn't get out that one where cartman sings about kyle's mom.. I won't mention the context of the song, I don't wanna be edited. but it's so funny.  although the plot stinks the first time you watch, after you watch it again and again, the plot gets funny. i dont really know why that happens, but you never know! cartman, eric, kenny and stan are a funny foursome up against the entire world and the town of south park, as they attempt to save two of the crudest guys on television from being killed, since stan or kyles mom is against all those farting jokes.  oh, and did i mention that them being from canada causes them to have different shaped heads, unlike those of south park... interesting fact.  watch the movie and get some crude humor and an ear for music.

Spice World," waste of singing
","What an attempt to score more money over girl power! the movie was tacky, outrageously stupid, and the jokes were so pathetic. the spice girls, who are known as a british girl group that give preteens the abilties to feel better about themselves and to have girl power really should have talked to their manager and checked over and over that this is the way to reel in the dough. so what is the true definition of girl power? If the movie was a huge sign of girl power, since they say it over and over and over again, then i get the point that girl power is high shoes and short skirts and pure garbage. i give them the credit for their singing, i like their singing. but the acting really must go somewhere far far away, and thank the lord another movie wasnt made.  they should have done a live concert and then made into a dvd special collectors item, and thrown in some free stickers. that could have made more money than that movie ever couldve made with the sales of owning it and seeing it in the cinema. if you were ever a spice girl crazed fan, who felt the need to view every item of girl power produced, trust me when i say that you are NOT missing anything if you never saw this.

Batman Returns," great batman!
","batman returns is a really great batman movie.  i never saw the batman with jack nicholson in it, but that's ok, because if you didnt see that this batman sums it up.  michael keaton does a great job as the leading bat, and does manage to maintain a higher glow of male sexuality dripping all over in his batman suit. rumors were that the catwoman was to be played by someone else, but i dont remember the womans name. i saw her on vh1 because she and the director tim burton got into a quarrel about why she wasnt wanted for the role.  i saw the woman on the show, and she couldnt have done what michelle did for the role.  if the woman who played her in the 60's could have seen her acting, she would have been proud. great makeup on the penguin, (**SPOILER**) especially when he bites off a nose, that was really gross but added to the dramatic effect of the evil hero.  the plot, of course, comes from a comic book, and does have some rather stupid points. but, batman was quirky, originally, with all the bat gadgets and stuff. i think all three of them combined in a huge way, making the movie a success. for all you batman fans out there, this is a must see for you.  A fair word of warning, ladies, you wont be the same when you see michael running around town in the batman uniform.  (A A-)",9,0,0,10 January 2004
Scary Movie 2," they were pushin' the envelope!
","god, you figure that they would leave this movie to die and never bring it back since the 1st one really didnt appeal with that many jokes. i think that maybe the first one did have box office success though. but good things sometimes dont happen twice. it didnt for this one. with the sex jokes repeatedly used over and over and over... the toilet humor just was expected. the plot was dumb, and the characters somehow lose intellegent points. the slight humor i found was ok and didnt have anything to do with anything. isnt that the point for the wayan brother's movies?

","Forrest gump was an excellent movie that made me cry **spoiler** when jenny dies and he doesnt get jenny after he repeatedly saves her over and over again from childhood to adulthood.  i didnt like the fact that after all that saving, he didnt see that he could truely do better. but the bond they shared when they first met helped me understand the movie and why jenny was a key person to forrest.  his journey being told while waiting at the bus stop has some funny moments and tearjerkers.  tom hanks did an incredible job portraying forrest, and made me feel for forrest, he made me feel happy when he does **spoiler** break those braces for his legs and made me feel sad when jenny goes away after he just came back from the war. take the movie and watch this with a huge tub of popcorn and a extra large box of kleenex!

10 Things I Hate About You," classic teen flick
","julia stiles playing the rude sister, andrew keegan as the self-obsessed model, allison as the popular 10th grader, and heath ledger as the hairy rebel.  together the cast makes the typical teen movie that has the same problems that not very many kids encounter with lately.  oh and the kid from the third rock from the sun is in there too. he gives the performance that all the characters do revolve around. of course, he wants to date the popular sophomore that has the hugest crush on the model. the cycle never ends! and so, the movie has some great funny moments that i wont spoil for you. and the flick has some kind of after effect of puppy love, that makes you want your boyfriend or girlfriend to hold you.  but watch the movie and try to think about typical high school problems.

American Pie," come get a slice of pie!
","American Pie is about as american as american pie. the movie is perfect at showing exactly how obsessed teenagers are with sex and trying to get some pie.  jason biggs, and seann william scott are hilarious, and you all know that you wanted finch to get any at all, just because all the others were getting laid left and right!  the movie is all full of crude and sexual humor, however, that starts and ends the movie, but i must say that without that nasty language, how many teens would have seen this movie? the movie wouldnt have been the same without it!  but yet the movie did focus on teenage dating, which didnt involve sex on the first date, and the couples eventually hold out for the ones that they do care about or find attractive... this is a teen classic!

Edward Scissorhands," Poor edward!
","Wasnt that a tearjerker or what? (**SPOILER**)  This poor boy falls in love with a girl, and cant touch her because he will poke out her eye.  Edward is a great example that the world is cruel in accepting others that are different from everyone else. One family, or a select group of people, are open to the numerous disabilities of society and would embrace them with open arms, while some would sell them to the freak show in a minute. That was a huge theme that hit me square in the face, and made me cry to even consider someone having scissors as arms. (**SPOILER**)  In the hopes of getting fake arms to replace the scratchy scissors, the man that created and truly loved him dies out of the blue.  Edward is always haunted by the arms still remaining there, which some disabled people could be haunted by whatever they lack. And some cannot handle the pressures of the taunting and the rumors, and explode with rage and lock themselves away. I truly felt the performance of edward, who was dumb about cultures and easily trusting.  I know the whole issue i wrote about is weird, but that's how i perceived the movie to mean. Winoya does a great job too, however, after her whole scandal with the shoplifting, i wonder why edward didnt have hands of gold.... (LOL) Shows what happens when you let the mind wonder.

Save the Last Dance," interesting movie
","Save the last dance has some interesting points that really are pointed out. the inter racial relationship was disregarded by sara and the boy's friends and family, since she was white living in an all-black neighborhood.  i am NOT racist at all, i simply am pointing out a point. they all become friends, and they all do the same things that normal teens do.  the two were a very cute couple in my eyes, since they both were connecting on their dancing abilities, and really hoped for the best for both of them. (**SPOILER**)  i dont really understand why the old girlfriend of the guy had a problem of the new girlfriend being white and stealing all the good black guys... why was the issue of her being white have any effect on that at all? obviously, the two of them did go out, and probably had problems, since that girl was a real piece of work.. you have to watch to know what i mean. but, in the end (**SPOILER**) the two of them do overcome all the issues surrounding their dating, so does that mean anything to society? maybe that inter racial relationships are ok. i dont have anything against inter racial dating, but my other focus was on the dancing. the two really did a great number at the club (**SPOILER**)and the soundtrack is really great. you should pick that up. well, i hope that could help, that's all i could really think about when save the last dance.

Dirty Dancing," get on up and dance dirty!

8 Mile," eminem doesnt disappoint!
","Critics were uncertain of the film, since the lead was a rapper that gets into everyone's faces about anything just to rap about them on the cd's. some artists really stink up the movies with their leading roles, (britney spears, mariah carey) and some succeed (cher, j. lo, madonna) with the success the films get.  eminem fits with the winners who can tranform to both roles, singer and actor.  playing a guy 'rabbit' who appears to go through the similar steps that eminem went through to achieve his rappingcareer.  rabbit and some friends go through the SHADY streets of detroit, trying to get rabbit to sell some of his raps.  and while doing all this, he trys to keep his little sister from harm after living with his mom in the trailer park.  the mom is a shaky character, played well by kim basinger, who after bless the child was not a good actor to me.  this role erased that image for her, and made the slate clean.  the same goes to brittany murphy, who seems to switch from good movies to bad movies.  the ending is the coolest and really captures the raw talent of the rapper, who does possess the skills.  i wouldnt be surprised if eminem does another flick like this, he really is good at it.  and besides that, the song that is on at the end of the credits was a hit for a long, long time on the charts.  the song was nominated for a oscar for the best song of the year. that's better than j. lo's thing when she had a movie and a hit song out.  but j. lo's song wasnt nominated for an oscar.. but anyways, the movie was a great success for the rapper and he can put that in his resimay, besides designer and rapper and artist.  what cant he do?  way to go!

(LOL)  with cuba gooding jr. as the only football player to stand by him by keeping jerry as his agent. the two make comedy together with the funny lines flowing, and keep the drama happening to make the movie not just a comedy but to have drama to it. the budding romance of cruise and renee keep you on your toes, wanting to see if jerry can handle the responsiblities of renee's son and being able to be committed to her as a person.  **spoiler** with the classic line that makes you want tom cruise to say to you, 'you complete me' and then being able to say to him 'you had me at hello' had me balling for 10 minutes and gave me pleasant dreams for a week.  So, if you dont want to watch a pure chick flick and a pure comedy, mix the two together and get a movie for you and him to watch together. (A- B+)",10,2,6,17 November 2003
There's Something About Mary," ben stiller hits home again!
","this movie gets funnier and funnier by the minute. with a comedic cast ready to rock and roll and with the quirky guys that sing every time that ben's character has a change of emotions, we get that mary is the best girl in the movie and everyone wants to be with her. she seems to be too nice to everyone and also has a quality that everyone sees themselves having a similarity to her.  but the most funniest connection was that ben's character, who helps mary defend her mentally challenged brother and gets the opportunity to take her to prom.  but in case i didnt mention, ben is kind of a nerd according to the 99.9% of the high school students. well, i will just say that he (**SPOILER**) doesnt take her to the prom and ends up wallowing in grief trying to live in the past and be able to take her to prom.  ben gets the craziest idea and decides to track her down and see if she's single. but the private eye is crooked and wants to get with mary. the movie could have maybe had more than one pretty girl to focus on, like terri and cherri, but that would have been too complicated. so enjoy the guest appearances of brett favre, the quarterback of those green bay packers, and get ready for dirty humor that does survive in this flick.

Titanic," a classic movie!
","this movie had to be one of the best movies of all time. (**SPOILER**) when the two of them are in love, regardless of social class, and hold on the very end, made me cry until i couldnt cry no more. leo dicaprio did an outstanding performance as jack, since i really couldnt picture him being that outstanding of an actor, after i saw romeo and juilet..enough said for that. and then kate winslet breaks in, being the opposite leading lady, and made herself known, in my opinion, as a good actress. i hope that this movie will let others see social standing are no barrier for love, since love is the strongest element that i believe is needed.  the man that played the supposed love interest, billy zane, did not a bad job himself. he really had me convinced of having a jeolous side and had me wishing that someone would just kill him off or something. but the love story appears to be the main focus of the movie. the sinking of the ship carried thousands of souls, and many of them probably had a love tale of their own. the experience of the ship sinking was remarkable, and truly made me feel i was there, and seeing the (**SPOILER**) old people on the bed and the children being tucked in as the ship sails away, since they know that they have no chance of surviving, since the first class had to get off first.  that really triggered an emotion inside me that had me crying for a long time as the ship slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean.  appreciate the movie and enjoy it to the best of your ability. a definite tearjerker with some of everything to offer the movie.

(**SPOILER**) to be completely honest with you, the only laughs were when jim goes crazy after the evil evan gets the anchor role on the show.  that was all, and that couldnt possibly be enough for a movie to survive on its own.  well, maybe it did have some other comedic points that should be noted, but i dont wanna write those all down.  but at least it isnt a slapstick comedy made up by directors in 10 minutes to get the almighty dollar.  this movie is just an ok, nothing higher or less. better luck jen and jim, but this one couldnt walk on water.

Jurassic Park," the dino ride of the year!
","first and foremost, i found the idea cool and a great way to reel in the money. the movie had me thinking about what if and who made and played the dinosaurs. i wanted to really think if anybody was inside the dinosaurs, where did the people go when the dinosaurs eat them? well, i thought all that through after i saw the movie. dr. grant was so ruthless, and proves that children could really change a grumpy man and make him happy during his stay at the local dinosaur running rampage park! the other doctor that was there at the park, dr. goldbaum, was the funny man of the movie. he made the eating appear comical and threw in some puns to help the movie's comedy side, which was a small one. i didnt really like the kids that were the park's leader's grandchildren. they lacked something to me and i couldnt really find them a believable source. but other than that, the movie was a great truimph for steven spielberg, who outstretched everyones imaginations, and let the preteens nearly wet their pants after watching the dinosaurs eat people left and right!
