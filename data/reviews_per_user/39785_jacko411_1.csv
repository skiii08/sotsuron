The Blair Witch Project," If I never see another indie film in a theater again....
","Perhaps I am merely a product of our prepackaged, mass produced society, but if I never see another indie film again, it will be far, far, far too soon... To sum up my experience with this movie, I will say these two things: First, I have not been afraid of the dark, nor the things that go bump in the night, since I was six years old Second, When attempting to portray characters lost in the throes of fear, know that a survival instinct kicks in, which likely would not include lugging around 60 pounds of equipment and filming all the while.  A camera is more likely to be used to smack something rather than try to film it, even when faced with a raccoon, never mind a homicidal spirit from beyond the grave. At first I thought it was just me, but as I glanced around the packed theater when the lights came up, my gaze was met by looks of confusion and disappointment all the way around.  This movie has been over-hyped to the max.  I was far more creeped out by this movie before I saw it, and now that I have, I wish I had at least waited a while longer before seeing.  Why spend half an hour in line at the box office, and then the concession stand to be disappointed?  Wait to see this movie, if you see it all...",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
