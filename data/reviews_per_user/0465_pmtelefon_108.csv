The Mask," One of the all-time great movie dogs
","Jim Carrey gives an excellent performance in 'The Mask'. The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Peter Riegert. Riegert strikes just the right note with his performance. Not too straight, not too broad. And of course, the dog is terrific. The dog gets some of the biggest laughs in this movie. Although I did see 'The Mask' in the theater, I haven't watched it in a while. I won't make that mistake again. 'The Mask' is a lot of fun. Honorable mention; a wildly dreamy Cameron Diaz.",8,1,1,19 January 2020
Saturday Night Fever," Great but unsatisfying.
","I wasn't a fan of 'Saturday Night Fever' when it first came out in the theaters. I was under a lot of pressure. I was a fifteen year old member of the 'Disco Sucks' club. I secretly liked the songs (I couldn't tell anyone) but the movie never hit the spot. Watching it now, the music is terrific but the movie is still not that satisfying a watch. What kills this movie for me are characters. Sure Tony is a sympathetic character but the others are mostly awful. I'm not a prude but if I was of Italian decent, I would ban this movie in my my house. The negative Italian stereotypes are over the top. They're just too much at times. That said, 'Saturday Night Fever' is definitely worth watching. It's wildly uneven but often terrific fimmaking.",7,0,1,23 November 2019
Whip It," May be the best movies parents ever
","'Whip It' belongs to Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern. They both give Oscar caliber performances. 'Whip It' is a perfectly cast movie but none of the other actors can keep up with them. It's not even close. Harden and Stern are so real, so on point, it's great to watch. There's nothing better than a movie villain who's not really a villain at all. 'Whip It' is currently in my Top Five sports movies. Great sports aren't really about sports.",9,0,0,30 December 2018
The New World," Beautiful looking movie.
","'The New World' is a beautiful movie to look at. Many of its images are stunning. The set design and costumes are also terrific. The music fits perfectly to the mood and look of the movie. If 'The New World' stumbles, it's in its storytelling. The story is strong but it does gets draggy at times. Those draggy moments make this movie feels longer than it actually is. All in all. 'The New World' is a solid movie that tells its story of two worlds colliding together in a beautiful, thought provoking way.",8,1,1,20 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very underrated
","I remember when I saw 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' in the theater. I liked it then. But after many viewings over many years, I really like it now. 'Phantom Menace' is a very good movie. It's beautiful to look at. The action is very strong. And, of course, it has Darth Maul. Maul is one of the greatest movie villains, ever. I just wish he was in more of the movie. 'Phantom Menace' is always a satisfying watch.",9,1,2,25 January 2020
Skyfall," Bond scrapes the bottom
","I remember when I took my then 13 year old daughter to see 'Skyfall' in the theater (Westbury, NY). It was her first Bond movie. I apologized to her when it was over. 'Skyfall' is not a good James Bond movie. It is a good looking movie and the action is well staged but at the end of the day, who cares? The story is uninvolving. The villain is weak. Javier Bardem's obnoxious performance only makes matters worse. It seems to go on forever. Despite all of the action, watching a melancholy 007 for two and a half hours makes for a surprisingly dull evening. 'Skyfall' is such a lost cause that even Albert Finney can't save it. Dishonorable mention: the always annoying Judi Dench.",5,3,4,2 March 2020
The Hangover," A lot of fun
",The first time I watched 'The Hangover' I didn't like it so much. I thought it was okay but overrated. I stand corrected. This is a very funny movie. The cast is very good. The laughs are spread out equally between the different characters. The movie looks good with some really nice location photography. Last night I enjoyed every minute of 'The Hangover'. Now on to the sequels.,8,0,1,10 April 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," At times, it's amazing
","Sometimes I forget how great 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' really is. Maybe that's because of the hit or miss sequels. Maybe it's because of the theme park attraction and many parodies. But then I sit down to watch it and it all comes back to me. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is really good. It has quite a few moments that are terrific. It's wildly exciting. It's great looking and the music is classic. I saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the theater (Bellerose, NY) and many times since. It's never one of my go-to movies but I'm always glad I picked it.",9,0,0,1 May 2020
Deepwater Horizon," Wow.
","I've always been a fan of disaster movies but few have the impact of 'Deepwater Horizon' The fact that it's a true story puts it in a class by itself. This movie did take its time to get going but that's fine. When it finally gets to the meat and potatoes, wow, hold on to your hats. Once the accident happens, 'Deepwater Horizon' becomes quite terrifying. This movie is a powerful and moving tribute to the victims and their families. Honorable mention: an excellent John Malkovich.",8,0,0,28 September 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A good, but not great, family movie.
","I've always enjoyed 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'. It's a funny, exciting and quite emotional movie. I just could never understand why it was such a monster hit. 'E.T.' deserved to be a hit but I never understood why it connected with people the way it did. I still enjoy this movie when I see it but I don't seek it out that often. I did see it in the theater but I saw it towards the end of its run. Maybe I spent that summer hearing how great it was and when I finally got around to seeing it the build-up was just too much. That my expectations were too high. That said, 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is good movie.",8,0,3,2 September 2019
Hereditary," Lighten up, Francis
","'Hereditary' takes itself way too seriously. It cries out for a lighter approach. At the end of the day, it is what it is. What is it? It's a dopey horror movie. It's seriousness drags the pacing way down. It's long running time doesn't help much either. It's at least twenty minutes too long. The actors try hard but are forced to walk around with pusses on their faces the entire movie. I normally enjoy Gabriel Byrne's work but not tonight. He seems to be asleep (literally) half of the movie and sleepwalking the other half. Toni Collette works her tail off. She must have gone home every night completely exhausted after filming. But to what end? The DVD box quotes somebody saying that 'Hereditary' is this generation's 'The Exorcist'. Not hardly.",4,1,4,13 January 2019
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," This may be a perfect movie
",I didn't see this movie in the theater. Shame on me. What was I thinking? 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a true classic. Director Robert Zemeckis & company took a great script and made a borderline masterpiece. Everything works perfectly. 'Roger Rabbit' is a wildly entertaining movie. It is laugh-out-loud funny and very exciting. The cast is terrific. Bob Hoskins should have been nominated for an Oscar. He is the glue that holds this movie together. It's an amazing performance. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one of the greats..,10,0,0,22 March 2020
Monty Python's Life of Brian," So bad it makes 'Holy Moses!' look good.
",I'll put my Monty Python fan resume against anyone. I started watching 'Flying Circus' in the '70s when it first aired in the US on PBS. I've seen all of their movies and concert videos. I have all of their albums. I've read most of their books. I've seen John Cleese live. Being a fan doesn't mean that you are blind. There was a reason that they had a hard time finding investors for this movie. It's not funny. There are maybe six laughs in the whole movie. Most of it is annoyingly unfunny.,2,4,22,10 February 2019
Mulan," Not one of my favorites.
",I understand that a lot of people enjoy 'Mulan' but it never really does anything for me. I'll watch it once in a while but not nearly as often as I watch some of the other Disney animated movies. 'Mulan' is a great looking movie. It has a few nice moments and one great fight scene but that's about it. It's just not that interesting of a movie. The story and characters just aren't that involving. Most of the humor falls flat. The songs are mostly forgettable. The voice work is kind of bland. I don't mean to pile on because 'Mulan' is not a bad movie. It's just not for me.,6,0,3,5 October 2019
As Good as It Gets," Very entertaining
","'As Good as It Gets' is kind of corny but that doesn't matter. I like corn. It's beautifully acted by everyone involved. It's very funny. My only gripe with this movie is its length. It should have been a half hour, or at least twenty minutes, shorter. What should have been left out? I don't know. All I know is that every time I see 'As Good as It Gets' I always notice it's length. A movie this good shouldn't have me thinking like that.",9,1,1,11 February 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Top 10 of all time
","'Shaun of the Dead' may be a perfect movie. I hits all the right notes. It never has a misstep. All of the performances are great. The jokes are so funny. The sad parts are played just right. A big part of this movie is the editing. It creates such a great flow that the movie just pulls you in. Unfortunately, these guys turned out to be one-hit wonders. That's a shame. I was hoping that they were going to have a great run. That said, 'Shaun of the Dead' is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.",10,0,0,8 December 2018
Rocky V," Feels like homework.
","Somewhere inside 'Rocky V' there's a good movie trying to get out. The seeds of a good movie are there but they were never given the chance to develop. 'Rocky V' has the feeling of a movie that rushed into production. I'm a fan of Sylvester Stallone but he didn't do a very job with 'Rocky V'. The script and dialogue aren't so hot. He has a couple of nice moments on screen but he has a few bad ones too. I don't want to say that Sly mailed it in on this one but he comes close. The rest of the cast isn't very good either. Both Tommy Morrison and Sage Stallone are in over their heads. Only watch 'Rocky V' if you want to be able to say that you've seen all of the Rocky movies. Otherwise, there's no reason to watch it. Dishonorable mention: an annoying Talia Shire.",4,0,2,28 July 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," This one always leaves me a little flat.
","'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is never that satisfying a watch for me. I know a lot of people enjoy it. It does have a few really good moments. But overall, it just kind of lays there. A couple of the characters don't really work. The music is not that hot. The movie is a fifteen or twenty minutes too long. There is a seriousness to the movie that doesn't really work. That's why it's great whenever Mr Beaver shows up. He lightens everything up. 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a bit of a rarity. It's a 'Part 1' that's weaker than it's sequels.",6,0,2,30 March 2019
Us," Heavy handed silliness.
","Someone should explain to writer/director Jordan Peele that 'Twilight Zone' episodes were only thirty minutes long. They weren't two hours. Just like his earlier movie 'Get Out', 'Us' is a elongated 'Twilight Zone'. The first half hour or so of 'Us' is painfully dull. After that the movie picks up but by the end it doesn't take us anywhere worth while. The cast is fine, I guess. The movie is not. I'm also not a fan of the horror movie 'twist'. I know people who love the 'twist' but I like to enjoy a film's journey not it's contrived 'shock' ending. I think the 'twist' usually takes away more from the final product than it adds. That said, I didn't like the twist in 'Us' either. It's just extra icing on a cake that wasn't too good to begin with.",4,2,3,15 September 2019
The Irishman," It felt like homework
","Sometimes you can't go home again. With 'The Irishman' director Martin Scorsese takes one too many trips to the mafia well. Watching this movie often feels like you're watching a summer reunion tour of a bunch of old rockers but not nearly as fun. 'The Irishman' does have some nice moments but it goes on forever. It needed some serious script editing. It often feels like Scorsese and company were picking up scraps from other (better) gangster movies. As far as the performances go, they weren't so hot. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci all have a couple of good moments but they also seem to be on auto-pilot much of the time. As far the CGI goes, De Niro looked more ill than young in those scenes. Netflix claims that they spent zillions on this production but it doesn't look like it. It has the cheap look of a made-for-tv movie (which is what it is). At the end of the day, 'The Irishman' isn't that good. It ends up dragging down the batting average of all the talent involved. Dishonorable mention: the casting of church basher Jonathan Morris as the nursing home priest.",5,4,9,8 December 2019
Batman Returns," A Christmas favorite
","Like everyone else I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I kind of remember thinking it was okay. Most of the people I knew back then were disappointed in it. I watched on video way back then with my parents. They both hated it. My mother called it the most disgusting movie she had ever seen (Years later when she was in her mid-80s that title went to 'The Human Centipede'!) But over the years I've grow to really enjoy 'Batman Returns'. Fans of the most recent Batman trilogy often talk about how they like the 'darkness' of those films. Well, I'm sorry to say, those movies don't come close to the darkness of 'BR'. Which is why it doesn't sit well with many people. That said, I totally dig this movie. I watch it every year at Christmastime.",10,3,16,18 November 2018
Rise of the Guardians," It keeps growing on me.
","After I saw 'Rise of the Guardians' in the theater (in 3D) with my daughters I kind of liked it. After several viewings on video I'm starting to really like it. It is an usual story but it is a very satisfying one. The are are quite a few exciting moments in this movie. It also has some nice 'tear in the eye' moments too. The animation style takes a little getting used to but it is well done. 'Rise of the Guardians' is an
enjoyable movie to watch. It doesn't even matter if kids are in the room or not.",8,0,0,28 September 2019
Home Alone," A true classic
","'Home Alone' is one of those movies that gets better every time I see it. I've always been a fan ( I saw it when it first came out at MovieWorld in Douglaston, NY.) but each year I find myself enjoying it more and more. I laugh at new jokes every time I watch 'Home Alone'. That's no neat trick. Macaulay Culkin should have won an Oscar. He's terrific. I keep forgetting how small he is until the Wet Bandits hang him on the coat rack towards the end. He's a little boy. Yet, he carries a whole movie. It's amazing. The scene that puts 'Home Alone' in the classic movie category is the church scene. It's one of the Top Ten greatest scenes of all time. It's all about forgiveness. It always is. Merry Christmas.",10,2,4,25 December 2018
A Bridge Too Far," This might be the greatest war movie ever made
","Director Richard Attenborough and company created a borderline masterpiece with 'A Bridge Too Far'. I saw this movie in the theater (Bellerose, NY) and many times since. It is a movie that has never really left my consciousness. It is filled with great scenes, amazing imagery and beautiful music (I own the CD). The all-star cast is also terrific. They all give outstanding performances. There is no weak link. 'A Bridge Too Far' is funny, exciting, scary, emotional and heartbreaking. It is a criminally underrated film.",10,0,1,27 May 2020
The Terminator," Great sci-fi action movie
",I haven't seen this one in a while. It used to be on cable a lot but I haven't crossed paths with it in a while. That's too bad. 'The Terminator' is a great action movie. There's one great scene followed by another great scene. This movie began quite a streak of solid movies for director James Cameron. Arnold too.,8,3,3,26 November 2018
Ready Player One," Left me flat
","I can never enjoy a movie when I fly. The screen is too close to my eyes and I can never settle down enough to really pay attention to what I'm looking at. That said, I can watch the screen in the next row just fine. This past August I watched bits and pieces of 'Ready Player One' flying back and forth from NYC to San Diego. It really grabbed me. I thought the action and CGI looked great. It still looks good on DVD but it little else going for it. Uninteresting characters and an uninteresting story are a bad mix. And I'm sorry, I find constant references to other (and usually better) movies a little tiresome. 'RPO' is one '80s movie reference after another. Despite all of the action, it's gets kind of boring after a while.",5,1,3,30 November 2018
The Hateful Eight," QT's 70 mm ego trip.
","They made a big deal about Quentin Tarantino filming 'The Hateful Eight' in 70 mm. Great, I thought, I love big, wide screen westerns. You don't get to see them that often anymore. Then he films 90% of the movie inside a cabin. What?!? Oh boy, I knew then I'd been had, again, by QT. I don't like the expression but I'll use it anyway: QT jumped the shark many, many years ago. He fell into the same trap as Brian DePalma (one of my favorites). DePalma was great at paying homage (ripping off) Alfred Hitchcock. Then he began ripping off himself. QT payed homage to many different film makers. Now, he just pays 'homage' to himself. Skip 'The Hateful Eight' and watch QT's 'Reservoir Dogs' instead. They're both the same movie and 'Reservoir Dogs' is an hour and a half shorter.",2,1,5,27 April 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One of the greats...And I can't explain why
",Maybe the most entertaining movie ever made. It's violent but it doesn't matter. There's more music in it than 'Paint Your Wagon'. But it doesn't matter. Western fans like . Lay people love it. I can't explain it. I guess a lot of the credit goes to George Roy Hill. It's a true classic.,10,1,3,19 February 2018
Final Destination 2," Gory fun
",'Final Destination 2' is a lot of fun. It's good as a sequel or as a stand alone movie. The cast is good and they all do a nice job but this movie is all about the Rube Goldberg type death scenes. They are all very clever and fun. 'Final Destination 2' is a solid entry in a surprisingly entertaining franchise. Honorable mention: a dreamy A.J. Cook.,8,0,0,8 April 2020
The Polar Express," I should watch this one more often
",'The Polar Express' is often more than a little strange but in a good way. It does a great job creating a different world. It's strange world that is totally believable. The characters all look a little weird but they fit in just fine. It's a beautiful movie to look at. I wish I could see this movie again in 3d. That's the way I saw it when it first came out. 'The Polar Express' has a lot of great moments but my favorite is when all of the elves gather for Santa's flight. It's so much fun to watch. 'The Polar Express' does a great job leaching us to believe. It can flip back any of us on the fence.,9,1,1,24 December 2018
Malcolm X," Self indulgent and way too long
","I remember reading during the production of 'Malcolm X' director/writer Spike Lee saying in an interview that he needed this movie to be over three hours long. He said that all of the great movie biographies were over three hours so this movie would be too. If a lengthy running time is a director's primary goal, his priorities are out of wack. A director's primary goal should be telling a good story. However, the very long running time isn't the only problem with 'Malcolm X'. The first half (the weaker half) is filled with distracting costumes, camera movement, dance numbers and endless cameos. For a while I thought this movie was going to have more cameos than 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'. Another problem is Spike Lee's misuse of music. It pops up at the wrong times and takes you out of the drama of the scene. On the plus side, the acting is very good. When this movie was released film critics Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert said that movie was made for all audiences. That not true. 'Malcolm X' was made for a very specific, very small audience. I am not part of that audience. If you are, more power to you. Honorable mention: Delroy Lindo.",4,1,3,11 December 2019
The Best Years of Our Lives," Top Ten of All Time
","'The Best Years of Our Lives' is one of the best movies ever made. It's a beautiful looking movie. It has great music. The cast is top-notch and they all deliver excellent performances. This movie tells its powerful story in a beautiful way. There is no downtime. This is probably the fastest three hour movie ever made. I first saw this movie in the early 1980s in a film class at Queensborough Community College (Bayside, NY). I've seen it many times since. It never gets old. There's not a dry eye in the living room when this one is over. Director William Wyler and company created a masterpiece with 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. Honorable mention: a dreamy Cathy O'Donnell.",10,0,0,23 May 2020
Taxi Driver," Scorsese's first classic.
","I recently told a friend at work that although I've seen 'Taxi Driver' a bunch of times and that I always dig it, that are sometimes when I don't get it. He said that it's about a nut. Well, maybe but I think it's a lot more than that. Martin Scorsese and company hit a home run with this movie. It's one of those movies that as soon as I start watching it it's impossible for me to look away. It grabs me and never lets go. Great stuff all around. 'Taxi Driver' is a true classic.",10,0,2,1 September 2019
Tangled," Wildly entertaining
","'Tangled' is one of Disney's most entertaining movies. It's beautiful to look at. It's very funny. And at the end of the day, it's a rather emotional experience. There's not a dry eye in the house when is one is over. 'Tangled' is filled with great characters and one mean villain. 'Tangled' is always a welcome watch.",9,0,0,12 January 2020
Barry Lyndon," The Mad magazine version was way better
",Quite possibly the longest three hours of my life. Every few years I give this movie another go and after it's over I ask myself why did I bother. It is a beautiful movie to look at. There's no denying that. But it's a movie filled with uninteresting characters. I very quickly lose an interest in Barry Lyndon and what he's up to. The main problem is Ryan O'Neal. He's not a good enough actor to pull this movie off. I do enjoy many of his movies but this one is out of his league. Two hours into it today my daughter walked in the room and asked 'Why are you watching this? It looks like a painting?' Well said.,4,4,12,18 February 2018
Rocky II," This may be the greatest sequel ever made.
","'Rocky II' is not as good as the original movie but it doesn't miss by much. 'Rocky II' seamlessly continues the Rock story. The other sequels are just sequels. This movies starts off a little goofy with one or two too many silly jokes but once it gets into gear it's great stuff. The entire cast delivers terrific performances with stand-out work from Carl Weathers. Weathers is excellent playing a man consumed with anger and hate. It's a performance of a lifetime. 'Rocky II' is always a great, emotional watch.",10,1,1,7 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's okay but should have been a lot better.
",Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones' misses the mark for me. It has quite a few really good scenes but overall it's too long and too plot heavy. The scenes that really drag 'Attack of the Clones' down are the ones with Padme and Anakin. When the two of them are on screen together time stands still. Their 'romance' is wildly uninteresting. Whenever I watch this movie I find myself fast forwarding through those scenes. Doing that makes 'Attack of the Clones' way more enjoyable.,6,0,0,28 July 2019
The Godfather: Part II," Top 10 Most Overrated Movies Ever
","This is the weak middle part of a not so hot trilogy. 'The Godfather' was great, this one was okay and 'Part 3' was bad. 'Part 2' is too long and often uninteresting. The scenes between Michael and Kay drag the movie to a halt. The storyline between Michael and brother Fredo plays out in an unbelievable way. Despite all the famous lines, the scenes don't ring true. Michael hates Fredo inside at the ball but wants to save him minutes later on the street. Only to hate him again when they get home. And they constantly refer to Marlon Brando. They must say 'Papa' or 'Pop' 40 times. Constantly reminding the audience that the first movie was better is not a good move. When I was a kid I wanted 'The Towering Inferno' to win Best Picture because I thought it was a better movie. I still do. 'Chinatown' should have won that year. Coppola's own 'The Conversation' is also a lot better than 'Part 2' and was a worthy candidate for the award.",6,3,11,21 September 2014
The Revenant," Watch the original
",This story was told once before in 1971's 'Man in the Wilderness' starring Richard Harris. It's not the greatest movie ever made but it is a lot better than 'The Revenant'. 'The Revenant' is ruined by the camera work. It's filled with non-stop extreme close ups and tons of footage shot with some 'fish eye' type of lens. It's wildly distracting. This movie looks like your watching a shooter style video game. The camera is also constantly spinning around. To what end? I don't know. I'm surprised audiences didn't get motion sickness watching this film.,5,1,1,25 November 2018
American Psycho," Unfunny 'satire'
","Sometimes my movie sixth sense is right. I put off watching 'American Psycho' for twenty years because I didn't think it looked very good. Well, I found myself watching it today and I was right. 'America Psycho' stinks. There are a lot of problems with this movie. The main problem is the always overpraised Christian Bale. Bale delivers a solidly obnoxious performance in this movie. It's his fault that I quickly lost all interest in not just his but in all of the characters. I sat watching 'American Psycho' not caring about anything that was happening.",3,0,4,30 January 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Overrated doesn't mean bad.
","I saw 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' in the theater (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) when it first came out. I thought it was great. I watched it many times after it was released on video and cable. As I watched it tonight I realized that when I watched it, I only watched the the first half. I realized that I almost never finished the movie. Tonight I watched the whole thing and realized why. The second half isn't that good. Sure there's some good action but it's not that interesting. The first forty-five minutes or so of 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is terrific. The second part of the movie pales in comparison. It's a good movie but not as satisfying a watch as it should be.",7,2,6,18 October 2019
Heartbreak Ridge," Top shelf Clint
","No actor has embraced getting older better than Clint Eastwood. He sees the story potential of getting older. 'Heartbreak Ridge' is a great example of this. I saw this movie in the theater (MovieWorld, Douglaton, NY) and many times since. It is always a very satisfying watch. It has a strong supporting cast. Everyone gives a nice performance. There are a lot of laughs and solid action. Clint's character is one of his best. 'Heartbreak Ridge' is always a welcome visit.",9,1,2,25 April 2020
Rocky IV," Lazy film making.
","I am a fan of Sylvester Stallone. I think he's underrated as an actor, as a writer and as a director. That said, Sly mails it in with 'Rocky IV'. There's very little story. There is very little dialogue. There's one musical montage after another. If you took all of those montages out of the movie, it would be an hour long. 'Rocky IV' can only be enjoyed with a finger on the fast-forward button. Dishonorable mention: an annoying Talia Shire.",4,0,3,8 July 2019
Duck You Sucker," Not Leone's best but still great
","'Duck, You Sucker' is a great, powerful movie. It starts as a very funny adventure but slowly turns into a painfully serious movie. 'DYS' is both an epic in its visuals but also in its sadness. The last hour or so is rough stuff. I usually watch Rod Steiger and put up with his hamminess. However, in this movie he is terrific. His performance is both very funny and heartbreaking. I just take points off the movie because of its length (it's just a few minutes too long) and for some pretty fake effects later in this film.",9,2,4,1 December 2018
Inside Out," Misses the mark with me.
","I did enjoy 'Inside Out' more today than did I did the last time I watched it. So, it is growing on me. That said, it still misses the mark. It's just too weird to be a truly satisfying experience. A lot of it comes off like a stoner movie. I have a hard time connecting with the characters. Although Sadness gets her share of laughs, she's mostly pretty annoying. I know a lot of people really enjoy this movie. I know that it's heart is in the right place. I'm not ready to give up on this movie. I hope 'Inside Out' continues to grow on me. We'll see.",6,1,2,21 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," My least favorite Bond movie
","I am a huge 007 fan. I believe that old joke about there not being any bad version of pizza the same way I look at James Bond movies. There's no such thing as a bad one. That said, 'Quantum of Solace' comes close. It has a weak story, a great villain trapped in the wrong movie and (forgive me) too much action. It's dizzying at times. On the plus side, this is a beautiful movie to look at. The location photography is often stunning. I especially liked watching the scenes shot in Haiti. I watch a lot of movies but I can't think of any movie that showed me more of that country than this one does. I did kind of enjoy watching 'Quantum of Solace' tonight. It's not a good movie but I don't hate it as much as I used to. Dishonorable mention: the always annoying Judi Dench. Do we really need to see M putting on cold cream?",5,4,4,29 February 2020
No Country for Old Men," Overrated doesn't mean bad.
","'No Country for Old Men' is a well made movie. It's just not a very satisfying one to watch. The Coen Brothers are good film makers. They've made more than a couple of very good movies. One of the biggest elements in their good films is missing in this one: humor. 'No Country for Old Men' is almost laughless. The humor is greatly missed because this movie is actually kind of silly. Javier Bardem just walks around like the Terminator. He's indestructible and, therefore, not very interesting. Josh Brolin's character is also not very interesting. 'No Country for Old Men' is an unusual Coen Brothers movie because it doesn't warrant many revisits.",7,1,2,19 October 2019
The Love Guru," There were no survivors
","'The Love Guru' is a brutal watch. I actually saw this movie in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY). It was a huge disappointment. Now when I watch it, it's almost depressing. Mike Myers dropped the ball big time time with this movie. This movie's laughs/clunker ratio is something like 1/50. It has one unfunny (mostly crude) joke after another. Sure, I laughed once or twice watching this movie but only once or twice. 'The Love Guru' is the pits.",2,0,0,19 April 2020
1941," Wildly uneven but it's growing on me
",'1941' has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but at the end it's not very satisfying. I laughed more this time I watched it then ever before (maybe about 5 times now). The mostly terrific cast works really hard and bats a solid 500. Meaning about half the jokes are funny. Watch '1941' as an example of the big budget bombs of that era and enjoy it. It's not that bad.,7,0,3,13 October 2018
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," It has its moments.
","'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is definitely worth watching. It has quite a few exciting scenes. It's well acted by all with very nice work by Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlewaite and Vanessa Chester. However, 'The Lost World' is not as good as it should have been. It's undermined by a weak script. Much of the movie is actually kind of silly. The special effects are very good but they can only carry a movie so far. Is 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' as good as the original 'Jurassic Park'? No, of course not. Is it better than the other sequels? Maybe.",6,0,1,19 November 2019
The Little Mermaid," One of Disney's best
","'The Little Mermaid' is a wildly entertaining movie. I saw this movie when it first came out (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) and many times since. Today was the first time I watched it in many years. Shame on me. It's terrific. The characters, artwork, story are all top-notch. The music is off-the-charts . Every song is great. 'The Little Mermaid' also packs quite the emotional punch. It's a great movie that I'll be watching again soon.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Mostly Forgettable.
","I enjoy talking about movies. I'm like the detective in 'The Exorcist', I love to 'critique'. I prefer to talk about good movies but it's fun to talk about the bad ones too. The ying and the yang. The ones in-between aren't as much fun to discuss. That's where 'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' belongs. It's okay. There's not much else to say. Leonardo DiCaprio works hard but to no end. Brad Pitt is on cruise control. Margot Robbie is reduced to just a pretty face. It's Quentin Tarantino's bridge to nowhere. When people discuss QT's films 'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' won't be mentioned often. QT's fans and haters will probably both agree on this one. It's okay.",5,12,26,29 July 2019
Frozen," It ends up being quite good
","'Frozen' is not one of my go-to Disney movies. Whenever I put it on I always forget how good it is. Despite the good songs, the first half hour or so is kind of slow and uninvolving. It's not until Elsa takes off into the mountains does 'Frozen' really shine. The last hour or so ( the majority of the movie ) is very good. It's funny, exciting and quite emotional. 'Frozen' is not the first Disney DVD I will pull out but after I watch it, I'm always happy that I did. (I saw 'Frozen' in the theater in Westbury, NY.)",8,1,1,24 May 2020
Dog Day Afternoon," It's starting to show its age.
","'Dog Day Afternoon' was a big movie when I was a kid. Over these many years, the bloom has come off the rose a little bit. Not a lot but a little bit. I've never been that big a fan of Al Pacino. He can be a very good actor when the director keeps the reins on him. An unleashed Al Pacino wears out his welcome pretty quick. Pacino has some nice moments in 'Dog Day Afternoon'. There's no doubt about that but he also over does it a little bit at times, too. As far as the supporting cast goes, they're all terrific. Another knock on an otherwise good movie is it's length. It goes on a little bit too long. There were a couple of times when I felt like one of the hostages. All in all, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is a satisfying, if somewhat dated, watch.",7,1,2,17 November 2019
The Longest Day," One of the greats.
","'The Longest Day' is one of the fastest three hours you will ever spend. The movie is so good that it goes by like a blink of the eye. That's because it might be a perfect movie. It's a beautiful looking movie. it has an amazing cast. It tells its complex story in very understandable and, more importantly, human way. 'The Longest Day' is very exciting, very sad and often quite funny. Its movie making at its finest. It's a true classic.",10,0,3,6 October 2019
Slap Shot," A classic
","I saw 'Slap Shot' in the theater (Bellerose, NY). I've seen it many times since. It's a one of a kind movie. It's wildly funny. It has has a bunch of great characters. The cast is top-notch. Paul Newman delivers another terrific performance. George Roy Hill directs another terrific movie. Everything works perfectly in 'Slap Shot'. 'Slap Shot' never gets old. (By the way, I remember when I saw the movie in the theater the posters had a warning on them warning people about the language in the movie.)",10,0,0,20 May 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Wildly entertaining
","'Back to the Future Part III' is a great last part of a classic trilogy. 'Part III' is funny and very exciting. It's the love story, however, that makes this movie so good. Doc Brown and Clara are one of my top five movie love stories. Biff (I mean Mad Dog) is great as always. As a western movie fan I enjoy how 'Part III' plays by all of the western rules. It's not a spoof. It's a western with a time machine thrown in. Great fun all around.",9,2,2,31 January 2019
Grudge Match," Wildly underrated
","'Grudge Match' is a top-notch entertainment. When I saw this movie in the theater (Westbury,NY) and I thought it was great. I went to work the next day to spread the word and nobody cared. What a shape. 'Grudge Match' is a very funny and very human movie. It has a great story and tells it well. It's cast is great and they all give terrific performances. 'Grudge Match' is a fun movie with just the right touch of emotion. If my dad was still around, he would have enjoyed this movie (my mom too).",9,0,1,21 December 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A near miss.
","After I saw 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY) I thought it was pretty good. I still think it's pretty good but I don't really understand the following this movie has. The imagination behind the visuals is terrific. It's a very interesting movie to look at. But even with its very short running time (76 mins), it feels too long. The biggest problem with 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is the songs. The songs are mostly bland and kind of samey. I'm a fan of Danny Elfman but this is one of his weaker efforts. I know this movie is popular. I know that they are still selling merchandise for it. But for me, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is not as satisfying a watch as it should have been.",7,1,2,19 October 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not so hot
",When I saw this in the theater I kind of liked it. Now all these years later I kind of don't. Tarantino's constant references to other movies goes from distracting to annoying pretty quickly. It's like a Mel Brooks movie without any laughs. Bloody severed limbs is funny when Monty Python does but Tarantino does it for what seems to be a hundred times and it just gets yawns. This movies was the beginning of the end for Tarantino.,5,0,0,21 February 2018
From Dusk Till Dawn," It's not that hot
","I was a bigger fan of 'From Dusk Till Dawn' when it first came out. I will never forget the sound of the bats coming from behind the theater and towards the screen. It was great. Watching the movie now, it's not as great. The first 'half' is very good. The second part brings down the GPA like you wouldn't believe. Overall, it's watchable but not worthy of it's reputation. Dishonorable mention: Cheech's speech.",6,0,0,9 February 2019
Jerry Maguire," Always a welcome watch.
","I regret not seeing 'Jerry Maguire' when it was in the theater. I wasn't that big a fan of Tom Cruise at the time. With the exception of 'Mission Impossible', Cruise had six or seven movies in a row that I either didn't like or had no interest in. When I finally caught up to 'Jerry Maguire', I found it impossible to resist. It is not a perfect movie. It does lose it way for a little while. At the end of the day, 'Jerry Maguire' is a beautifully acted, emotional movie. It is always a satisfying, eye wiping watch. Honorable mention: a dreamy Renee Zellweger.",10,0,1,1 December 2019
The Hangover Part II," Worth watching
","'The Hangover II' is watchable fun movie. It does seem to get stuck in the same same gear for a while but it redeems itself with a very strong last twenty minutes or so. Sequels to comedies are always harder than sequels to other types of movies. Once again the cast is very good. The location photography is excellent. Overall, 'The Hangover II' does a nice job and delivers a good amount of laughs. Dishonorable mention: way too much full male nudity.",7,1,2,4 May 2020
Rudy," Ever see a grown man cry?
","'Rudy' is one terrific movie. It is beautifully told story. The acting is great with standout performances by Sean Astin, Ned Beatty and Charles S. Dutton. And the music, Wow! Composer Jerry Goldsmith is a Hall of Famer and 'Rudy' might be his best work. This movie is a wildly emotional ride for me. My daughters will tell you that I cry all the time at movies. That's not true. I only cry when I'm deeply moved. 'Rudy' deeply touches me like few movies have. It's one of the greats.",10,1,3,25 December 2019
Annie Hall," Borderline bad Woody
","Tom (Billy Jack) Laughlin dropped his membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts ans Sciences after 'Annie Hall' won Best Picture. He believed that 'Star Wars' should have won. He understood that George Lucas' film would forever change the way movies were made and that it should have been recognized for that. It's hard to argue with that. Especially now since 'Annie Hall' is almost completely forgotten. 'AH' is rarely mentioned when Woody Allen fans discuss his movies. It wasn't that good then and now it seems completely dated. Many of Woody's films get better every time I see them ('Stardust Memories' ,'Zelig','Scoop''Broadway Danny Rose'). 'AH' just lays there. It seems an hour longer than it is. There are some laugh out loud moments but it hardly seems worth the effort. Then again, it's way better than 'Alice'.",5,1,3,9 March 2018
Avatar," It wears out its welcome
","'Avatar' is a great looking movie. There's no denying that. The story and the characters aren't that original but that doesn't bother me. What bothers me about 'Avatar' is the length. It's too long by at least a half an hour. I saw this movie in the theater in 3D (Lynbrook, NY) and several times since. My reaction is always the same. I'm all in for in first couple of hours or so but then my interest starts to fade. 'Avatar' is a near miss for me.",6,0,0,23 April 2020
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Not a classic but still fun
","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' is not as good as the original but it's not far off. Sure the Sticky Bandit stuff goes on a bit too long. It's also a little bit too mean. But other than that, this a funny, warm movie. John Hughes knew how to write. The sweet scenes work perfectly. The music is also very good. The movie is well acted by almost everyone. I don't watch 'Home Alone 2' as much as I watch the original but I do visit it quite often. Honorable mention: Buzz.",8,1,4,22 December 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Overrated doesn't mean bad.
","I used to enjoy 'A Clockwork Orange' a lot more when I was was a lot younger. Over these many years I like it less and less. The rape scenes never bothered me back then but now that I have two daughters, I have a hard time sitting through them. Those scenes are just as exploitative as the rape scenes from the first two Death Wish movies. (Wow, I just compared Michael Winner to Stanley Kubrick.) Another demerit is that it's hard to call a comedy a good movie when a lot of the laughs are unintentional. That said, 'A Clockwork Orange' is often quite compelling. It has excellent performances from the entire cast and terrific music. I just wouldn't rank it up there with Kubrick's best work. This movie is required viewing. (P.S. This is my wife's least favorite movie of all time. Between her and my daughters I have to watch it on the sneak.)",7,0,0,29 June 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Ruined by one scene.
",I'm not a prude when it comes to movie violence but I don't like my nose rubbed in it. Quentin Tarantino rubs the audience's nose it it with his 'Reservoir Dogs'. I was digging this movie until that scene. After that scene I lost all interest in what was going on. QT hit the 'Off' switch in my head. I didn't care anymore. What a shame.,6,0,3,17 August 2019
Rocky," Top Five of All Time.
","I saw 'Rocky' in the theater (Floral Park, NY) on its first Saturday. It was one of the few times I went to the movies completely blind to what I was about to see. It turned out to be the greatest movie I had ever seen. All these years later it's still one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. There are few movies that connect to the audience like 'Rocky' does. 'Rocky' is filled with excellent performances. They all deserved Oscars. Stallone also deserved one for his screenplay. The music, of course, is great. 'Rocky' is a true classic.",10,1,1,3 June 2019
Inside Man," It made me feel like a hostage.
","This movie is the pits. I should have known better. Denzel Washington hasn't made a good movie in 15 years. Spike Lee hasn't made a good movie...ever. Put those two together and you get a mega-mess of a movie. The camera never stops moving. The music never stops playing. Lee is from New York but you would never know that from watching this movie. All of his 'New Yorkers' are corny, stereotypes with unbelievable accents. The plot itself is so contrived and silly that you don't care about any of the characters. Jodie Foster is totally wasted in a rather minor role. Chistopher Plummer is no spring chicken but he is still 15 years too young to be playing his character. Inside Man was a never ending, mind numbing experience. I saw this with three friends and we all hated this bomb. It will have a good opening weekend then quickly fade away as word of mouth spreads. If you want to see a good heist movie, go to the video store and rent one of the many that were made in the '70s.",2,10,19,24 March 2006
Pulp Fiction," Top ten of all time.
","'Pulp Fiction' is one of the greats. Why does this movie work so well? I don't know, movie magic I guess. It's impossible to explain to the layman how great this movie is. It has a great cast saying some of the greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It's filled with great performances. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson have never been better (and that says a lot). 'Pulp Fiction' is not a perfect movie but it comes real close. It never gets old. It's a true classic.",10,0,1,16 August 2019
Rocky III," Okay, at best.
","I don't watch 'Rocky III' that often. I don't watch that much because it's not that good. It's actually pretty bad. The biggest problem with the movie is how Sylvester Stallone looks. He has perfect disco hair and way too many muscles. Sly's face looks like it has zero percent body fat and it's very distracting. He doesn't look like Rocky anymore. Another problem is Mr T's character. Clubber Land is a one dimensional cartoon character. Mr T went on to have a good run because he became quite an appealing personality. He gets to show none of that in 'Rocky III'. He just a screaming, insulting (PG style, of course) robot. Another disappointment is the Paulie character. He has a great opening scene and then he turns into comic relief. On the plus side, Sly delivers a pretty good performance and Carl Weathers (also with way too many muscles) is also quite good. Overall, 'Rocky III' is pretty forgettable. Dishonorable mention: an annoying Talia Shire.",6,0,4,23 June 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," It's NOT sentimental hogwash
","'It's a Wonderful Life' is one of the Top Ten movies of all time. It's almost a perfect movie. I can't think right now of a reason why it's not a perfect movie. There must by a flaw in there somewhere but right now I can't think of one. It truly is a movie that gets better every time I watch it. I find new things to focus on each time I see it. Sometimes it's the dialogue. Sometimes it's religiousness. Tonight I focused on Jimmy Stewart. Wow, he gives a performance of a lifetime. As I watched him tonight, I wondered about Stewart losing the Best Actor Academy Award. Who beat him out? Fredric March in 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. March was great but I'd give the edge to Stewart. He's in almost every scene. It doesn't matter which way I approach watching 'It's a Wonderful Life'. It's one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,5,8,23 December 2018
The Departed," It's not just overrated, it's bad
","Watching 'The Departed' was a real test of my endurance. It's a brutal watch. Boston accents float in and out, music is constantly in the background to no effect. The Boston locations are wasted. The cast is very strong but their performances are mostly uneven or sometimes just plain bad. 'The Departed' is unbelievable/uninteresting from beginning to end. Chalk up another overrated dud for director Martin Scorsese. Dishonorable mention: the ridiculous amount of Church bashing.",3,3,7,12 January 2020
American Made," Tom Cruise is becoming one of the greats.
","Tom Cruise is rapidly becoming one of the greats. I was never a hater. I've enjoyed a lot of his movies. I've been there since 'Risky Business'. However, there are quite a few I let slip by. Shame on me. 'American Made' is an example of a movie I might have let go. What a mistake that would have been. 'AM' is a great movie. It's one of those films that never shifts down as it goes on. Just like Cruise's character, this movie is in forth gear the whole time. It keeps on building speed. The only reason I took a star off (a 9/10 instead of a 10/10) is because I never cried.",9,0,1,11 March 2018
Rosemary's Baby," A pretty good 'classic'
","'Rosemary's Baby' always ends up being a satisfying watch. It takes its time getting there but by the end, it delivers. It is well acted by most of the cast. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are the two stand outs. I wouldn't put 'Rosemary's Baby' on any Top Ten list. It's a famous movie but it doesn't reach the level of a classic. That said, after it ends I'm always glad I watched it.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
Jersey Boys," Clint's worst
",Clint Eastwood is a Hall of Fame fimmaker. His batting average is great but 'Jersey Boys' is not. It's unwatchable. It has one unlikable character after another. The performances are obnoxious. I've been watching a lot of Clint lately so i decided to give this movie another shot. I shouldn't have bothered. 'Jersey Boys' is the pits. It's probably the most annoying movie I have ever seen. Clint really dropped the ball with this one.,2,0,0,17 March 2020
Joker," E for effort.
","It was refreshing watching 'Joker' in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, 'Joker' succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with 'Joker' is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during 'Joker' but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro.",7,5,9,21 October 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Draggy greatness.
","'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is a flawed classic. There is so much to talk about when it comes to this movie. Way more than there is on its surface. It's a great looking, well acted movie. But it also has a bit of of problem... its length. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is about a half an hour too long. As much as I enjoy watching this movie, I also find myself drifting off once in a while. That said. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' has been on my movie rotation for quite a while and isn't going to leave it anytime soon.",8,0,0,30 October 2019
Con Air," Mean, violent, over-the-top and wildly entertaining
","This is mean fun stuff. It changed Nick Cage from a semi-romantic comedic lead into a movie bad ass. Fun characters played by a great cast. The pacing, the music and the laughs are dead on. The action is over-the-top. This is an action movie women will watch and really enjoy.",10,3,4,3 March 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Still packs a punch
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is a very emotional movie. It takes its time telling its story but it doesn't feel long. It is a great looking movie with a terrific cast.

Writer/director Frank Darabont does a great job mixing violence, cruelty and humanity into a very satisfying watch.",9,0,0,20 April 2020
The Cannonball Run," I think a '5' rating is fair.
","There are still people at work who talk fondly of 'The Cannonball Run'. I was never that big a fan. I saw it in the theater (Bellerose, NY) with a bunch of friends. I remember most of them really liking it. I thought is was okay. I still do. I was then, and still am, a big fan of Burt Reynolds. I would rank this movie among the better of his weaker efforts. There are quite a few laughs, a lot of beautiful women and great stunts. It has a great cast. All of whom seem to be having a great time. I'm surprised someone got screenwriting credit. The movie seems to be mostly improvised. At the end of the day, 'The Cannonball Run' is lazy film making. It feels like director Hal Needham ( I read his autobiography, by the way) filmed one of his house parties and added in some stunts later.",5,0,0,26 June 2019
Wonder Woman," Why did I bother?
","I should have know better. The hype was just too much. At the end of the day, it's just another superhero movie. And not a very good one at that. Yes, there's plenty of action but do we really care? I know 'Wonder Woman' was a big hit but did anyone over the age of nine really leave the theater talking about how great this movie was? I find it hard to believe. 'Wonder Women' is a typical cookiecutter superhero movie. Yawn.",5,1,6,2 February 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Biff rocks
","'Back to the Future II' is way better than people remember. Many times the second chapter of a movie trilogy is the weaker of the three. The part 2 often serves as a link between the first and last parts. That's not the case with 'Back to the Future II'. This is a very clever, and very exciting, movie. The way they connect new footage with old footage is amazing. Even all these years later it's hard to see the seams. On paper the story might seem confusing. But when you watch the movie, it all makes perfect sense. 'Back to the Future II' is great fun and it also leads the league in product placements. During the first half of the movie it over the top. But that's okay, it's part of the fun.",9,0,0,20 January 2019
Taken 2," Okay (I guess) time killer
",'Taken 2' is not for me. I end up watching it once in a while because my wife and teenage daughters like it. 'Taken 2' has the classic movie problem. If you don't care about the characters then you won't care about the movie. Liam Neeson is not that interesting in this movie. The action is unbelievable and kind of boring. The location photography is good but the camera never stops moving. It ends up being almost dizzying. 'Taken 2' comes very close to being a camp movie. It never crosses the line but it comes close.,5,1,1,20 May 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Top ten most overrated movies of all time.
","Overrated doesn't mean bad. It just means that something is not as good as people say it is. 'The Silence of the Lambs' isn't a bad movie. It's an okay movie. The best part of the movie is the music. It gives the movie a creepy vibe. The rest of the movie isn't so hot. This is the kind of movie that while you are watching it you think it's really good. But when it's over and you begin to think about what you just watched, you realize that it's pretty dumb. Hannibal Lector escapes by wearing a dead guy's face. Silly. Oh by the way, how did Lector steal the pen? They don't tell you because it would have been impossible for him to steal it. Now after all these years (and years of CSI type tv shows) the little gross out elements that 'The Silence of the Lambs' has seem awfully tame. It's an okay, and I guess somewhat mandatory, watch.",5,1,4,4 May 2019
Black Panther," The emperor has no clothes.
","'Black Panther' may be the most overrated movie of my lifetime. I'm truly shocked that people thought this movie deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. About half way through the movie I was seriously trying to figure out if it was an unfunny comedy or a failed parody of some kind. Correct me if I'm wrong but this may be the first movie in history that after tons of murder and mayhem the hero actually agrees with the villain. Wow, this movie actually sides with the bad guy (but not his methods, of course). Yikes. Shame on Disney.",2,3,4,24 April 2019
Creed II," Get ready to fast forward.
","'Creed II' is a painful movie to watch. The original 'Creed' was just as bad. The Rocky series of movies is a failed franchise. One is a classic ('Rocky'), another is great ('Rocky Balboa'), one really good ('Rocky II') and now five really bad ones ('Rocky III', 'Rocky IV', 'Rocky V', 'Creed', and 'Creed II'). 3 wins and 5 loses is pretty bad. So is 'Creed II'. This movie is filled with uninteresting characters doing uninteresting things. Michael B. Jordan is an actor for fourteen year old girls. He can't act but he always takes his shirt off. When he gets into the ring it's totally unbelievable. The too long running time ( forty minutes longer than 'Rocky IV') just makes matters worse. Dishonorable mention: the always annoying Phylicia Rashad.",4,0,4,19 May 2019
Casino Royale," Bourne-again Bond
","I'm a big James Bond fan. I remember leaving the theater (Westbury, NY) after watching 'Casino Royale' and being very excited about the future of Bond films. I had a great time watching this movie. Over the years and after many viewings the bloom has come off the rose a little bit. I am a Bond purist but I do recognize that the movies need to evolve some in order to remain fresh and inviting to new audiences. They can't be making new 007 adventures only for 56 year old men (like me). I understand all of that. It's just that producer Barbara Broccoli should have more confidence in her property. She shouldn't try to imitate Bond's imitators. That said, 'Casino Royale' is a very exciting movie. It does skip a beat here and there but overall it is quite an enjoyable ride. Dishonorable mention: the always annoying Judi Dench.",8,1,4,28 February 2020
Beowulf," Greatest 3D movie ever made
","I saw 'Beowulf' in the theater (Westbury, NY) in 3D. It was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. I'm a fan of 3D. I've seen a lot of 3D movies before and since 'Beowulf'. 'Beowulf' still stands above the crowd. On DVD it's still a good movie but the experience is different. Now I spend most of the movie having flashbacks to what it looked like in the theater. That's not a bad thing. It stills leaves a great taste in my mouth.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
The Sixth Sense," Keeps getting better

","'Cinderella' is not one of my go-to Disney movies. I'll watch 'The Jungle Book' or 'Lady and the Tramp' two or three times before I get back to 'Cinderella' but that doesn't mean that I don't like it. I do like it. It is a fun movie. The mice are great. Lucifer, the cat, is a great villain. The final ten or fifteen minutes is very exciting. When I do watch 'Cinderella' it never fails to hit the spot.",8,0,0,8 April 2019
Final Destination," A fun clever movie
",'Final Destination' is not what I would call a scary movie but it is an entertaining one. It's certainly different from most horror movies. All of the 'big' scenes are very clever. I saw 'Part 3' before I saw this one but that doesn't make any difference. All three movies stand on their own. 'Final Destination' is a satisfying watch.,8,0,0,20 February 2019
A Night at the Roxbury," Solid SNL comedy
",'A Night at the Roxbury' is better than it looks. It's actually pretty funny. It does run out of steam for a little while but then it redeems itself with a very strong last twenty minutes or so. 'A Night at the Roxbury' has a very good laughs/clunker ratio. It's a movie that deserves several revisits.,7,0,0,15 March 2020
Godzilla," The last half hour almost makes it worth while.
","The last hour hour or so of 'Godzilla' is quite good. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save the movie. The first three quarters of this movie is not so hot. The biggest problem with this movie is that most of the monster stuff takes place at night and you can't really see what's going on. It's annoying. The cast and the acting are okay at best. Bryan Cranston's performance is as bad as his wig. I don't mind stars making a cash grab. They should strike while the iron is hot. But they should at least try to do a good job. Cranston, however, seems to be mailing this one in. He's a real detriment to the movie. Overall, 'Godzilla' is a mostly forgettable movie. On the plus side, they'll never stop making Godzilla movies so there's always hope.",5,2,3,27 October 2019
The Hangover Part III," The wolf pack finishes strong
","'The Hangover Part III' is another strong entry in a strong trilogy. 'Part III' wraps things up a very satisfying way. The are a lot of big laughs and nice moments in this movie. It's also a terrific looking movie. The cast does a very nice job, as usual. I'm very happy with the way 'The Hangover III' turned out. Dishonorable mention: full frontal Ken Jeong.",8,0,0,8 June 2020
Easy A," It Comes Close
",It doesn't quite hit the mark. Emma Stone gives a great performance. Her charm is off the charts. Her parents are great. Her favorite teacher is also great. The movie somehow misses the mark. Maybe it's the needless religion bashing that turned me off. I don't know but it didn't help.,6,0,0,16 June 2018
The Great Escape," Top 20 of All Time
","'The Great Escape' is a true classic. It never gets old. It still strikes the perfect balance of excitement, humor and sadness. It's a great looking movie with classic music (I own the CD). The cast is excellent and they all do a great job. Steve McQueen is the one that people talk about the most but to me Charles Bronson is the star. Bronson gives a terrific performance. I've seen 'The Great Escape' a bunch of times. It's probably the fastest three hour movie ever made.",10,0,0,13 May 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," There is no joy in Mudville
","'John Wick' was bad. 'John Wick: Chapter 2' is even worse. The movie has a lot of fans but I think they're missing the joke. But then again, there aren't any jokes. It plays like a serious spoof. It's like watching Keanu Reeves play a video game. All it is is Reeves shooting dozens of faceless villains. It has a lot of action but it's boring and uninvolving. If I was twelve, and had never seen a movie before, I may have liked it.",3,4,8,18 November 2018
Annihilation," A misfire
",On paper 'Annihilation' should have been a good movie. But it's not. It moves so slow. It's so 'serious'. It's so heavy handed that much of the life in the script is smothered. The characters are all uninteresting sour pusses. There some good scenes towards the end but by that time my interest was down to almost zero. I'm glad I stuck it out but there wasn't much of a payoff. 'Annihilation' will be quickly erased from my memory bank.,5,2,6,24 February 2019
True Romance," One of the 1990's best movies.
","'True Romance' is a great movie. It's wildly entertaining. It's beautifully acted by almost everyone involved. 'True Romance' has more than a handful of great scenes. A couple of those scenes are classics. Although he didn't direct it,'True Romance' is one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies. Honorable mention: Dennis Hopper.",10,4,5,18 August 2019
The Breakfast Club," An '80s 'classic'.
","How 'The Breakfast Club' leapfrogged all of the other great '80s teen movies to become the classic of the genre is a bit of a mystery to me. When I saw it in the theater (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) I liked it but never did it cross my mind that this movie was going to be the '80s movie that future generations would be watching. I mean both of my daughters had to watch 'The Breakfast Club' in school (even though it's rated 'R' and filled with cursing and parent bashing). It is a good movie but the 'serious' scenes are a drag to watch and, at the end of the day, kind of silly. It is actually the scenes with Mr Vernon and janitor Carl that save this movie. They are the best characters in movie not the whiny teens. All that said, 'The Breakfast Club' is required viewing. At least once.",7,0,1,25 May 2019
The Wedding Singer," One of the great romances
","I've never really been a fan of Adam Sandler's movies. That's why when 'The Wedding Singer' came out, I didn't really care. A few years later I watched and I haven't stop watching it since. This is one of the great movie romances. It's a wildly satisfying movie. The cast is terrific. The story is sweet. And, of course, the music is great. There a few clunker jokes here and there but they are all erased by more than a few moments of greatness. It takes me an hour to watch the last twenty minutes or so of 'The Wedding Singer'. I keep rewinding it over and over again. Not a dry eye in the living room. 'The Wedding Singer' is great stuff all around.",10,0,1,21 December 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Great looking action
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is a great looking movie. It's location photography is often quite beautiful. The action scenes are terrific. The scene with the tank is a classic. I saw this movie in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY) and I've seen it many times since. 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is a lot of fun.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Goodfellas," Terrific
","'Goodfellas' is one of those movies that if I catch it on tv, I stop clicking around. Even though I've seen it a bunch of times, I stop searching the channels and I watch it again. I remember seeing this movie in the theater (Bayside, NY). The theater was filled with a few loud-mouths and they took some of the thrill away from the movie. I've seen 'Goodfellas' a bunch of times since and it's one of the greats. It's not a perfect movie but it comes close. By the way, this movie is special to me because the scenes at Joe Pesci's mother's house were filmed on the block where I grew up (241 Street, Bellerose, Queens, NY).",10,0,0,1 April 2020
Warm Bodies," It had me at hello
","'Warm Bodies' is a solid entry in the 'fun zombie movie' sub-genre. It tells very unique story in a nice way. The two lead actors, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, are very appealing. Their interaction is really cool. Did I cry watching this movie? No, I didn't. Will I cry in the future (because I expect to be watching this movie quite often)? Probably. I liked 'Warm Bodies'. I think it's the kind of movie that gets better with each viewing.",8,0,0,14 June 2020
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Borderline great
","I don't know what it is but every time I sit down to watch 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' I think I'm In for an okay movie. For some reason I never remember this movie for how funny it is. In about ten minutes I remember that 'Talladega Nights' is a very funny movie. This movie has a terrific look. I think the way this movie was filmed plays a huge part in why it works so well. The only demerit, and it's a huge one, is the casting of the almost unwatchable Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen is my kryptonite. I can't stand him. Despite Cohen's dead weight, 'Talladega Nights' delivers a ton of funny moments. Honorable mention: a terrific Gary Cole.",8,1,1,15 March 2020
