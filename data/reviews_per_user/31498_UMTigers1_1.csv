Casablanca," A great love movie
","After watching this movie by myself, I have decided that if I was ever to watch this with a woman I definitely would win some major points. This is one of the best movies ever. Although it starts off slow, you really get into it. I have never seen such an excellent portrayal of forbidden love between two lovers. How could Bogart just walk away! I know I never could.This movie really makes you associate with the characters and really become involved with them. I can't count how many times I became angry when she wouldn't just leave with Bogart. If you like great love movies or just great movies in general, this movie is for you. And guys, it wouldn't hurt to watch this with a special someone.",9,3,4,19 June 2004
