Ford v Ferrari," Another Disappointing Hollywood Racing Failure
","This movie might have been better titled 'The Ken Miles Bio' for the almost complete absence of point to point competition between the two car marques. Hollywood has yet to make an excellent racing movie but this one isn't even in the top ten. I gave it a three for excellence in period features such as technology, classic cars and the like. The secondary actors were better than the primaries. Don't waste your money.",3,3,8,31 December 2019
Detroit," Race-Baiting At Its Worst
",If the producers of this terrible picture intended to produce a vehicle which would incite violence or hatred to one race or the other they have succeeded. As a literary piece of work it fails miserably (save for some good work by several actors). The story of this unfortunate incident could have been produced as a full documentary without all the violent scenes and gore and still made its point.,3,11,21,17 December 2017
Wind River," The Scenery Was Beautiful
","And that's all the positive things I can say about this 2 hour waste of time. I probably would have understood it a bit better had the audio not been so muffled or the action so profoundly slow. This is, at best, a 40-minute TV movie but not even then is it worth your time. The plot was predictable almost from the beginning but the execution was so slow I actually fast forwarded several times just to stay awake.",2,1,6,6 December 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Huge Waste of Time
","This movie is one of my all time worsts. It has absolutely nothing going for it whatsoever. Every third word, literally, is a swear word and by ten minutes into the movie you are numb. Not one actor generates any sympathy and, in fact, had I the option I would have had no trouble shooting everyone on screen. A cheap attempt is made to soften the sheriff's character with a cancer diagnosis but it is just that - a cheap attempt. I should have been forewarned as I normally bypass anything with Woody Harrelson in it. I made it only 30 minutes into this piece of crap before erasing it from my system. Very few other movies have earned this treatment.",1,6,17,1 February 2018
Dunkirk," Perhaps The Most Underwhelming War Story Ever Told
",The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the greatest achievements of WWII but you would not know it by this film. The story bounces around every few minutes to show another side of the story and becomes so disjoint that the episodes could be exchanged without altering the story line at all. The faces of the British soldiers all have that thousand yard stare and for the most part are expressionless. Not much to recommend this movie.,2,19,33,15 August 2017
Goon," Utterly Worthless In Every Respect
","I love the game of hockey and perhaps that is one big reason I saw a complete lack of anything positive in this movie. Whereas 'Slap Shot' told the story of minor league hockey (admittedly with some over-the-top humor) and 'Youngblood' the story of a hockey player who wanted a shot at the big time, 'Goon' tells neither a story nor illustrates it in anything but vulgar, obscene clich√©s. 'Goon' is an insult to movie-making and the sport of hockey. Even the game scenes are poorly done and unbelievable (such as the player telling the on-ice officials not to interfere with a fight).Not much of this movie makes sense. Someone not familiar with Canada or hockey would walk away thinking Canadians are vulgar, bloodthirsty cretins whose only interest is watching WWE-type brawls on ice when they are not replacing their native language with the worst foul-mouthed cussing I've ever heard on screen - virtually all of it unnecessary.If the intent of the movie-maker was to tell the story of a hockey goon, and there are such people, he fell incredibility short. If it was to tell some sort of love story (the goon falls in love of course) that goes by the wayside as well.I couldn't find a single thing in this stinking morass of a movie to like. It is crap like this that gives the sport of hockey a black eye.",1,6,17,13 April 2012
1917," This Story Told Many Times Before
",The sets and depiction of trench warfare are intensely realistic but this story has been told many times before. Although the film shocks the viewer with its non-stop shots of WWI butchery it is much too long and the shock wears off just when it should climax. Although it is not a comedy by any measure I compared it to M*A*S*H for its depiction of the resignation of the soldiers and the uselessness and horror of war. It is not a reboot but the story sure seems common.,6,0,1,20 January 2020
Flight," Total Waste of Film
","The only reason I can think of to watch this piece of crap is because Denzel Washington is your favorite actor and I give him credit for doing a worthwhile job in a film that has very few of those. Otherwise, this film stinks.Everyone in the film, with the exception of the captain (Denzel) is a stereotype including the normally excellent Don Cheadle. The girlfriend druggie with a heart of gold. The lawyer who uses omissions and technicalities to divert the truth. The co-pilot Bible-banger who has more faith in a god than in his own abilities. The airline owner who has secrets he doesn't want exposed in the prosecution of his pilot.The irony is that the crash depicted in this film did, in fact, occur - but over the Pacific Ocean and there were no survivors. While it would be nice to think that pilot could have saved his aircraft like Denzel did it wasn't possible and thereby lies the first improbable sub-plot of this movie.Disregarding the story line and focusing upon the movie itself there are several glaring shortcomings. It moves slow as molasses with the exception of the flight and crash. There is much too much wasted time showing closeups of Denzel in his drunken stupor. There are needless nude scenes which add nothing to the picture. The language is also needlessly vulgar and the audio track blasts the background music multiple times which is guaranteed to stop your heart if you were, like me, dozing off in the many scenes which encourage it.But the bottom line is missing. Oh sure, there is an ending. But it is neither satisfying nor surprising. It is as boring as the rest of the movie. You will walk away wondering just why anyone felt it necessary to make this movie when there are so many worthwhile stories to tell.This movie isn't a comedy nor is it an action movie. It could be a drama, if only it had some but alas, no. It is just a waste of time.",2,7,15,16 February 2013
