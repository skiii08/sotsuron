The King's Speech," One word...BRILLIANT.
","The film opens with Bertie, Duke of York (Firth), the younger son of King George V, making a speech and becoming embarrassingly tongue-tied. Hearing the echo of his words in the outdoor stadium is enough to thwart his efforts. He looks desperately unhappy as the audience watches, some with expressions ranging from sympathy to impatience - clearly this has happened before.Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), is an Australian speech therapist known for unorthodox methods. The moment we see his consulting rooms, its eclectic decor tells us he is an unusual character. Logue has a happy and active family. He and his wife (Jennifer Ehle) have 3 sons, ranging in age from early adolescence to late teens.Into this comes the Duchess of York (Helena Bonham Carter), clearly out of her element. Presenting herself as 'Mrs. Johnson,' she tells Logue her husband stutters and is called upon to speak in public. Logue replies that perhaps he should find a new job! She says that would be impossible, to which Logue inquirers if he is an indentured servant. 'Yes, sort of,' she replies. After she reveals his true identify, Logue only agrees to take him on as a patient if the therapy is conducted in his own office (no house calls, even for royalty) and tells her 'my castle, my rules.' A reluctant Bertie is coaxed into a first appointment, which ends badly. Logue records him reading the 'to be or not to be' soliloquy from Hamlet while wearing headphones blasting Beethoven so that he can't hear himself speaking. Bertie has little patience for these 'tricks' and ultimately rips off the headphones and storms out, but not before Logue presents him with the recording as a 'souvenir.' Some time later, Bertie plays the recording, in which he perfectly enunciates the Shakespearean passage , as Elizabeth, unseen, stands in the doorway listening.So back to Logue he goes.Their sessions are filled with pathos and humour. An unlikely friendship begins between two men from vastly different worlds - Logue insists on equality, calling the duke 'Bertie.' Logue knows that in most cases, stammering results from traumatic childhood experiences, although Bertie scoffs at this assertion. 'I was always like this,' he insists, Logue replying that no infant begins talking in a stammer. Gradually, his harsh childhood is revealed, sometimes in song at Logue's insistence, when it is too painful for Bertie to relate in speech.We all know what is going on in the background: the abdication crisis. Edward VI (David) and Wallis Simpson are unsympathetically portrayed. In one scene, David mockingly mimics Bertie's stammer, accusing him of wanting to steal his throne. In truth, Bertie dreads becoming King, breaking down in tears when he realises his fear is about to become reality. When GeorgeV dies, making David the King, David abdicates when not allowed to marry the twice-divorced Wallis.At one point the two men argue when Logue pushes Bertie too far & Bertie retaliates by saying some things to Louge regarding his origins & that he is 'a nobody, & that these lessons are over'.One of the funniest scenes is when Bertie goes around to Logue house to apologise & Logue wife comes home early (he hasn't told her about Bertie). Their roles are now reversed & it is Bertie telling Logue he is a coward & he should be a man & go out there.The Archbishop of Canterbury does not approve of Logue's influence on the King, and questions his credentials. In a pivotal scene at a Westminster Abbey 'rehearsal,' the King supports Logue, who admits he is not a doctor and does not have impressive credentials, but never misrepresented himself to clients. After the Archbishop leaves, an amusing 'rehearsal' scene takes place at the Abbey.The film takes a serious turn as Hitler comes into power. Bertie, Elizabeth and their daughters (Margaret and Elizabeth, the current queen) watch a coronation newsreel, followed by footage of Hitler inciting the German people. Bertie's comment? 'I don't know what he is saying, but he says it well,' envying Hitler's oratory power.Bertie is an affectionate, hands-on father, in contrast to his own childhood when he and his brother were brought to their parents for a 'daily viewing.' After he becomes king, the princesses hesitate, then curtsy, upon seeing him (I found that scene very sad as it shows his own child no longer see him a their father first but as king). Bertie's face changes as he realises how completely his life will change, but immediately gathers them into his arms.As WWII approaches, preparation begins for 'The King's Speech' to the nation. The end of the film is brilliant as Bertie speaks live on radio, with Logue there to coach him. We see shots of his subjects - soldiers, people in pubs, his mother, even David and Wallis - listening to the stirring speech. It is a resounding success, but realistically portrayed, as Bertie hesitates several times, following Logue's non-verbal cues to get through it. Afterwards, Logue tells him 'you still stammered on the W's' to which Bertie replies, 'I had to throw in a few of those so they 'd know it was me.' Director Tom Hooper revealed at the Q&A, that that response was taken from Logue's diary.The film ends with the royal family on the balcony, waving to their subjects as Logue watches, having, for the first time, addressed Bertie as 'Your Majesty.' It is noted on screen that Bertie and Lionel remained friends for the rest of their lives and that Lionel was awarded a CVO for 'personal service to the sovereign.' I highly recommend this absorbing drama with masterful characterisations by its two principal actors.",10,0,1,26 February 2012
Black Swan," overrated
","Now that I have watching this film, I don't know how it could get so much positive feed-back. The film was sadistic, confusing & boring. The atmosphere was oppressive, I couldn't wait for it to end. After the first 10 minutes or so, I wanted to turn it off but kept hoping it would get better. As soon as I saw the blood when she stabbed herself I felt so much relief as it meant the film was finally coming to an end. The scenes do not justify Nina's exaggerated drama, her overwhelming sadness goes too far when nothing really happens & I felt no sympathy for her character whatsoever. In fact, the story has no substance or credibility. Don't be cheated by the good reviews. I am just so glad I did not pay to see this film. I want my 2 hours back.",1,22,36,26 February 2012
