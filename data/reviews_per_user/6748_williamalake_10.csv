National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Tame Indiana Jones
","This film was OK, it was quite enjoyable and a worthy 6/10.Basically, a treasure hunter is looking for the biggest find of his life. It reminded me of Indiana Jones but not as good!! It was a far fetched story, but then again that is all it was, a fictional story. The film itself was entertaining, I can't say if it was better than the first one but as I haven't seen the first one. It certainly didn't make me want to rush out and watch the first one.The casting was good and all involved had good parts. Nicholas Cage was especially as good, but he always is. The supporting roles were also well acted. I would have like to have seen more puzzles to be figured out and more often than not the puzzles were solved very quickly. In these kinds of films I like to try to figure out the puzzles in my head as the film is playing, but the solution was often found quickly. The film could have benefited from more suspense.All in all this film was OK, I wouldn't watch it again but I suggest if you are after something light hearted, entertaining and not to difficult to understand then this one is for you! I particularly liked the French Policemen, the French of often typecast as arrogant and rude which makes me laugh as this isn't at all what they are like in real life!",6,0,0,18 August 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Immensely Funny!
","This is an all time great, it gets funnier every time I see it even though I know when all the jokes are coming up.This immensely funny film has had people quoting extracts from it on an everyday occurrence for nearly 30 years! Name another film that can brag that! My advice is simple, if you haven't already seen this film, go out and see it right away. If you have seen this film, go out and watch it again!It really is side-splittingly funny from start to finish. British humour at its best, crude, crass, with the odd bit of full frontal nudity!And remember, he's not the messiah... he's a very naughty boy!",10,0,3,10 August 2008
Monster," Disappointing
","The acting was flawless, I can't take anything away from both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci. When I read the synopsis, I thought 'Yes, this is a film for me'. But the film let me down. Maybe my expectations were too high.It sounds like the kind of film that I would enjoy, some serial killing and violence, something horrific. This film was very horrific, and at times you could really feel for the Aileen. But there was just a little too much dialogue at times.I can see why this is such a critically acclaimed film, the story was good and the acting was superb. The relationship between Aileen and Selby was of course important, but I think that the director focused too much on this at times. It really slowed the film down and I started to get bored in between the action scenes.",5,1,6,16 August 2008
Juno," Oh My God....
","This was a definite 1/10 for me, but this doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.This wasn't my kind of film. I don't even know why I watched it, but me and my flatmate did (I think we were really really bored) and turned it off about 1hr 15mins into it.This was, without a doubt, a chick flick. Moreover, it would ideally suit female teenagers. I can see the appeal, it wasn't like it was a bad film and I could see why people who liked this genre of film really liked it.So if this is your cup of tea, you'll probably love it. I shouldn't have watched it, it bored me senseless.",1,10,23,14 August 2008
Cloverfield," 1st person let down
","OK, for starters excluding the credits this film was 1hr 10mins long. That isn't film length, that's TV feature episode length.For me, there was not enough bad guy action, you only saw little bits and then the camera often jerked whilst the camera guy was running. It would have been better if it used both perspectives 1st and 3rd person and mixed both. More action shots would also have been nice.The film was quite fun for 1hr and for me, the last 10 mins really let the film down. This does, however, have a good user rating so maybe I am alone in my opinion.In all, it wasn't a bad film but it wasn't particularly good. When it was good it was very good, but that wasn't often enough.",5,2,4,21 August 2008
Blade II," Bladetastic!
","Yeah, blade... Enough said.But I need a few more lines...Great, fighting all the way through the film. Good fight scenes, fantastic effects and weapons. Typical blade really.Yeah, the reapers kick vampires arse's and blade comes along and beats everybody up. From start to finish Blade is the super dude. This was just as brilliant as the first one. OK it was similar in ways but why change it if it isn't broken. I loved this film. I will watch it again and I will tell everybody I know to see it too.Its not a perfect score as there are better films, but for me this tops its particular genre. A very worthy 8/10...",8,0,2,21 August 2008
The Doors," Good Film
","I Love the doors and Jim Morrison. So I thought that I would love this film too. I thought it was great, Val Kilmer did a fantastic job and I hardly doubt whether anybody else could have done better. But I did get a little bored at times. (I guess I felt how some of his band mates felt about his antics!) There is no doubting that Jim Morrison was a hugely talented individual, but he did have his demons. This film recreated this brilliantly and portrayed Jim as I would have imagined him to be (not being alive at the same time as Jim was!) The film, however, is only a 7/10 because it isn't the greatest film I've ever seen. It does provide an insight into Jim's Life and it was portrayed very well. I have seen better but I have seen a whole lot worse too! I would recommend this film to any fans of 'the doors' but you probably won't enjoy it if you don't like the band!",7,3,4,25 August 2008
Armageddon," Fun Hollywood Feel Good Disaster Movie
","I really enjoyed this film and it is a worthy 7/10.I just love the way that the US saves the day, I always watch these films with a wry smile. The typical US stereotyped Russian was hilarious with his one-liners, really put the comedy into the film.Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck are their usual best, and Steve Buscemi was great, very funny throughout the film.The film had a good mix of story, comedy, romance, action and was quite sad at times. The film is very entertaining and although it is quite unbelievable, one should remember that it is a Hollywood disaster movie and should not be taken too seriously. Although entertaining, this film will not be watched regularly, it was nearly 10years since I saw this the first and last time and it could be another 10 before I see it again. But I was well entertained and I will be the next time too.",7,0,1,12 August 2008
Batman Begins," Great Film
","Great film, back to how batman should be! The previous two films, made me lose interest in Batman, however after seeing this one I can't wait to see the Dark Knight.Batman should be dark and sinister and that was exactly what this one was. Superb acting throughout, really got lost in it all for a while.I would recommend this film to anyone, it really had everything. The story was good, it was visually stunning and sounded fantastic. It really is Batman back to his best.If you haven't seen this go out and watch it now! I did, I know I saw it a little late, but the Dark Knight really spurred me into action, I should have seen this months, if not years ago!",8,1,1,10 August 2008
Braveheart," Epic, Epically Long
","Yeah, this is an OK film.It seemed like it had it all, passion, war, love, freedom. It also had about 1hr of too much film.War scenes were brilliant, great acting and unbelievable scenery. This film, however, bored me for the last hour. I think that this film set the record for the amount of betrayals in one film, it quite quite boring and repetitive before the end.It was worth watching, but it isn't really my kind of film. I only watched it because my flat mate calls me 'William Wallace' and I never really knew who he was. Now I do...Watch this if long epics are your thing, but I have the concentration span of a fish...",5,3,8,10 August 2008
