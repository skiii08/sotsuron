Alien 3," 'A different 'ALIEN' movie'
","I have to say that in minority but for me this is the best 'ALIEN' movie of the trilogy and i gonna tell you why...The first time i see it in theaters i was disappointment...I mean ALIEN was the one that starting all...then ALIENS was AWESOME a lot of action a lot of adventure so i think (like everyone) that ALIEN 3 it would be the mix of the first 2 movies right???...WRONG!!!...They go to another direction and years later i understand why...Now maybe a lot of people didn't know this but James Cameron,The director of ALIENS,wrote a draft of ALIEN 3 in middle of 1989 but for wherever reasons the draft was rejected by the producers (The draft you can read it in the comic book ALIENS:COLONIAL MARINES)and read others scripts.Now For a lot of reasons (many of them valid)the movie was widely HATED when come out but the movie don't have the fault.The fault was of the producers they cut without the supervision of the director and was a really mess...Now i invited you to see the Asembly cut (Available in DVD and BLU RAY)to see the closer vision of the director of ALIEN 3 and give a chance this underrated sequel of the great saga of ALIEN.",9,4,5,4 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'I waiting 16 years for this???'
","I have to say that i was one of th people who pays $ 6 dollars to see only the trailer back in 1998 (i see it in Texas).Of course i was completely excited (i think everybody do) and i never stop to talk of the trailer in the next 6 months.The big day finally arrival and...I really really big disappointment let's just start:The acting very plane,the direction don't exist,the music offers nothing new (with the exception of The duel of fates theme),the special effects very CGI and the action-adventure of the movie is only the third act.The only good thing of the movie:The duel between Obi-wan-Qui Gon jinn vs. Darth maul and that's it!!!...Only that.I remember to go out of the theater and say 'I waiting 16 years for this?'...1999 was the year of THE MATRIX and not for Episode 1 and now 13 years later i still feel the disappointment.",5,1,4,22 December 2013
John Wick," 'A Great revenge movie and the great comeback of Keanu Reeves'
",I know i know we all ready see this kind of movie hundred and hundred of time (moslty the are bad movies) so you ask What this movie have different of the others?...simple.All the action you see in this movie is completely justify believe me...this time the revenge is not about women or kids or jobs or betrayal or money or something like that...This time the revenge is about a PUPPY.Yes you read right a puppy.The story is very simple and i not gonna tell you because of that...Now you can see that all that Wick do for the puppy is completely justify because is the only thing he cares and loves in his life.Now another movie of this kind came out this year named THE EQUALIZER (based in the TV series) with Denzel Washington.Now don't get me wrong Washington is a great actor but see it kick ass and bing bang guns you simply don't believe it because in not the kind of actor for this kind of movies.In the other hand we had Keannu Reeves...Maybe he's not Stallone or Statham or Willis or Gibson or The rock but he is NEO and this movie probes that is still in shape and kicks everybody ass in a great way.See the movie you wont be disappointment at all...You really glad that john Wick kick everybody ass because what they done to the puppy...You gonna out with a great smile when the movie ends and for me...Is one of the best movies of the year.,8,6,16,23 November 2014
Gravity," 'What a movie'
","Sometimes are movies that without warning take us to another level of emotions and visuals.Gravity offer that I read that a lot of people complain about the weak script I think was good or what do you want?:Aliens,Invasion,Monters,Space chips fighting? No no no this is a space-drama and that's it!!!.Cuaron in the direction was extraordinary The special effects sublime (believe me you think you are in space) Lubenski:the Oscar is yours!!! The music:awesome Sandra Bullock:Simply amazing.Just look the movie and have the ride of you life of course in space.",8,4,12,19 December 2013
Star Trek," 'What a Start!!'
","I ve fan of Star Trek since the First movie came out...I gonna be honest i am fan of the movies not the series so my review is only about the movies.I always say to the people that the saga needs 'new life' i mean the movies of the original TV series and The New Generation was great but that movies was only made to fans of the series of movies not to General Public so i say all the time that the series need a fresh reboot or new start.Because the tired of the actors and the lack of good scripts the saga enter a hole for a couple of years after the box office disappointment of Nemesis (Is not bad like some people say's...Is better than Generations and Insurrection) so they need to do something different with the saga.Boy i think someone listen to me..Is like a mix of Star Wars and Star Trek..Since the first act the movie have a lot of action,The special effects men...AWESOME,The music...forget John Williams Michael Giacchino is the new Sci fi composer of the new millennium,The Director j.j Abrams is the new Steven Spielberg but the cast...Ohh men!!...The cast!!!...Is like a casting made in heaven...All and i mean all the cast was Simple ATTONISHING...From Kirk to Scotty....what a cast.If you think this movie is like the other Trek movies...NO NO NO...You gonna be surprise with this movie a more than great Beginning to one of the most beloved sci fi sagas!!!",9,0,1,29 December 2013
Creed," 'A great Spin-off to the Rocky saga'
","I remember when i go to see Rocky Balboa a tough that was a great way to ending the series of movies,Rocky still have the punch and the people still love him (one of the best endings of the series) so i think 'this is it'.When i see the trailer of Creed i was surprise because this time is about Creed son's and not of rocky.Even that he already was a trainer before (remember Rocky V?) this time is different because is the best friend son who training so you can see the passion and magic of this.Stallone is same Rocky...Now i know the big question here:He deserves the Oscar for this movie? Yes and No.The acting is the same (I think he was better in Rocky Balboa) but if you take a count all saga movies of Rocky of course he deserves...But not for acting in this movie.The one who steal the movie is of course B.Jordan you can really feel that he is Creed son!!! and the direction are more that great.This movie in many ways a 'homenage' to Rokcy saga and believe me if you are Rocky saga fan you won't be disappointment.",7,0,2,9 February 2016
Ant-Man," 'Better than Avengers:Age of Ultron'
","Look first i have to say that i am a great fan of the MARVEL universe and i know when i say that Avengers:Age...was (for me) a great disappointment.Why? Because was the same of the same...Now ANT MAN at least comes with something fresh,cool and yes very very fun.If you want to take seriously this movie you be disappointment if you don't you gonna take the ride of the year with one of the best CGI special effects i ever see in this year.The cast are great:Rudd makes a great ant-man,the great Michael Douglas proves again that with the correct script he can make a great part,The extremely beautiful Evangeline Lilly have a great part too in the movie and the villain Corey Stoll makes a acceptable villain.The real star of the movie are the CGI special effects even that you know that are CGI you lost and feel the SF like be part of the story and not another part of the movie (see it in 3D believe me worth the ticket)My final toughs for this movie is that is a perfect summer movie you have too see (like Jurassic world) please don't take the movie very seriously because the movie wasn't make to take like that...Just buy your refreshments and enjoy this ride with this new fun and fresh super heroes. (Don't leave the theater they are 2 end credits).",7,1,7,18 July 2015
Watchmen," 'One of the most complex movies ever make'
","First i be waiting for this movie for at least 20 years!!!.I am a huge fan of TERRY GILLIAM and for long time he wants to adapt this comic book to a very faithful movie.He really really try many times and like he say's one time 'To be faithful to the comic at least the movie i have to make is 5 hours long' he try in the 80's,in the 90's so he simply quit to make and pass the torch to another directors.Directors like Oliver Stone,James Cameron,Michael Bay,Tim Burton,Guillermo del toro (He says the movie was UNFILMABLE)and Richard Donner to mention a few,pass on make it the movie.So when i heard that Zack Snyder,Very fresh of make 300,was gonna make this movie i was really excited,why? because he is the kind of director that have vision and an unique style of filming,and because he was very faithful to the comics (just see this year's Man of Steel)so i have really hopes for him.The result?...For be a extremely complex movie comic he make a great job like 300 and Sin City he was completely faithful to the comic (or in this case the Graphic Novel).The look of the movie was Awesome,the acting a great cast (especially Jackie Earle haley he stole the movie),the special effects Amazing and the score very great.For be a movie based in a adult very complex graphic novel the result was more than average Zack Snyder make a great movie and just because another great director's pass on make it this movie is a great triumph for Snyder.",8,1,3,24 December 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," 'The Revenge of the Sith of X-men Movies'
","Is great that Bryan Singer come back to the saga that he original created (He leaves the direction of X men 3 to directed Superman Returns and since then he regrets that)and see that he don't lost the touch.Like happen before in The Fast & Furious saga Singer bring back some of the original X men of the first trilogy and put together in this movie with the new generation of X men.The real STAR of this movie is the script...Very dark,Very tragic,Very complex.This for me is The Revenge of the Sith or The Dark Knight of X men movies,This is what X men 3 must've been and believe me is the best X men movie to date (onlye behind extremely close to X men 2 for me)The action is great,the special effects are awesome,the acting more that great (is glad to see again some familiar faces) but like i say before the STAR of the movie is the script.Believe me! you wont be disappointed this is easy one of the best comic book movies of all time!.",8,2,5,24 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," 'One word:Awesome!'
","One of the big problems with Batman V Superman was that the movie have not fun,magic and emotion Simple.Now when you see this movie the movie have 100% everything that BVS don't have..I now a lot of people hate the comparations of both movies but is inevitable.Right now MCU win the road to the box office champ of 2016 (We have to wait to see Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange later this year)and best comic book of the summer (Deadpool too).OK now the movie.The action are Awesome,the fights incredible,the special effects great,the acting very good,the direction amazing and the story with a lot of surprises.Look if you still disappointment of the CRAP (Yes! Crap!) of BvS this the movie you waiting for...One of MCU best!!!",8,13,26,3 May 2016
Ocean's Eleven," 'Be part of the gang'
","When this movie came out i really enjoy a lot and i gonna tell you why.The BIG Achievement of this movie was to put together this incredible and Winner cast of great actors.Starting with George Clooney,Brad Pitt,Julia Roberts,Matt Damon,Andy Garcia,Don Cheadle,Casey Affleck,Scott Caan,Eliot Gould,Shaobo Qin and of course Carl Reiner.The director Steven Sodenberg make a great job to keep every actor in his part you not gonna see actors stealing lines or stealing screen time or showing off or ego things...No No No...Sodenberg keep everyone in line so if you ask me who stole the movie? i would say Everyone.The plot is very simple:The best gang of robbers in town treated to stole simultaneously 3 casinos in las Vegas.The movie is the cast...The chemistry between then (especially Clooney,Pitt & Damon)are sensational.You have a action in this movie (although no gun is fired)a lot of comedy,Great adventure and some romance.This simply one of the best movies of Thieves of all time and one of the best cast of all time...Enjoy and be part of the gang.",9,0,1,2 January 2014
The Commitments," 'Great music,great acting,great director,great story...Great Movie'

Lawrence of Arabia," 'They don't make movies like this'
","I have to be honest i see this movie because Steven Spielberg always says that this movie is 'the best movie i never gonna make' so i decide to buy the special edition DVD and see it.What a great surprise come when i see it:First the cast: Peter o'toole was simply AWESOME (why in the hell they don't give it the Oscar?!?)Omar sheriff was incredible in this part,Alec Guinness like always was really really great and finally but no last Anthony Quinn unforgettable in that amazing characterization.Second The direction:David lean construct a one in a life piece of cinematography the view,the look,the photography,the music,the acting,the dialog,all in that movie that come together in one unique piece.Third The music:Maurice Jarre piece of music is simply unforgettable all the tracks are simply a masterpiece and are without of doubt part essential of the movie.I say it before and i say it now They don't make movies like this...and PLEASE don't try to do it.",10,2,5,20 December 2013
Coco," 'An Respectul Tribute to Mexican Culture and his People'
","All my family waiting this movie all the year since we see the teaser and blow up...and more because was a Pixar movie and they all make right all the movies they make (at least the 80%).And Jesus we all not disappointed at all...The music,the animation,the characters,the colors,the family...everything was just perfect.Now being a Mexican born a was worried that Pixar takes so many liberties of the Mexican culture,people,music and more...But that didn't happen they took all the things i mention before and converted in one of the best animated pictures i ever see and make me even more proud to born Mexican.I know you all the see the trailers and teasers and know how the movie it is but NO...the movie have a great twist and surprises that gonna make you love the movie even more...Like i say before everything in the movie is just perfect and one i have to say is that PIXAR portrait The day of the Death (dia de los muertos) very accurate and with a lot of respect.Just see it...you gonna love it Pixar make another classic movie to they collection and Mexican people of all the world...You be pride to be what you are!",9,140,238,28 October 2017
The Evil Dead," 'An horror masterpiece'
","I remember when in the ending of the 70's the horror-terror movies was at its highest point movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th,Blue Sunshine,The Dawn of the Dead,The Omen II,Jaws 2,Phantasm, Alien,The Brood and many many more shine in the screen.Evil Dead,like a lot of this movies,showed that you not need a lot of millions to make people scream in the theaters (The movie cost $375.000)that's why the movie works great because the director and the crew used all their imagination to make a Really scare movie with a some gore.The Plot is like this:5 friends come to a abandoned cabin to spend some days there when one of them find a book and a recorder and play the recorder the evil entity try to possess every one of the 5.The big accomplished of the movie are that even that was make it why little budget you never feel it that the movie was cheap or bad make it and other big thing is you really scare because the movie focus in the cabin not the characters and that work very well.It's a shame that don't make movies like this anymore but if you really really want's to scare see it and enjoy (I recommended to see it later of 10 of night).",9,1,3,2 January 2014
Logan," 'Good...But not great'
","I have to say that i am a huge fan of WOLVERINE since the comics and i follow all this years in movies.Hugh Jackman like Christopher Reeve,Michael Keaton,Brandon Lee,Robert Downey jr and some more...born to play WOLVERINE and he make a great job.Now this movie should be call LOGAN:THE ROAD MOVIE or WOLVERINE:THE ROAD MOVIE Forget to see fly fights or superpowers battles or something like that like we all see in the past Logan movies...What you going to see is a violent Logan almost dying taking care of Charles Xavier and waiting to die...Like we see in THE WOLVERINE the movie focus in his pain in how he don't have anything to live until Laura shows in the picture.Now i don't want to spoil something but the movie becomes a escape and running and found the others kids like Laura.The action are great and finally see the LOGAN that we all want to see.Violent,Wild,Aggressive and Bloody that we waiting for.Finally if you expect to see the comic book that is gonna change the world or something like that...This is not that movie. Like i say is good but not great...Now see for the last time play Jackman the character that he in some ways made it worth the ticket.",8,0,4,3 March 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," 'A sexual masterpiece'
","First one thing...You must have a lot of PETIENCE to see this movie...This the must quiet movie of all Kubrick's movies.This movie is like a deep dream into the sexual complex mind of Stanley Kubrick...This movie left you with a lot of 'What?,Why?But?'in the end...But that the mission of Kubrick...Left you with a lot of questions.The direction?...Kubrick is Kubrick...That why 'He's the men' (Like Jack Nicholson says)so you have an idea what you gonna see...The acting:Tom cruise's acting is for say it in one word:Different Very calm very afraid very scare,Nicole kidman in the other way sexy to hell and very very tenacious,But the movie belongs completely to Cruise period.The movie is about jealousy,insecurity,obsession and of course SEX...This movie than can only make it like someone like the Kubrick (I think the others directors are David Cronenberg and David Lynch)so don't ask to many questions and i have an unique ride into Kubrick complex dream.",10,1,2,31 December 2013

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'Not what you expected...'
","We all know how the prequels disappoint to everyone (Episode I specially) and the huge expectation to this movie to bring back the magic and nostalgia that the prequels don't have.Well...If you want see something new,unique,fresh and innovative in the STAR WARS universe...That's in NOT you gonna see.The movie feels in many ways like some kind of remake or retold of the original 1977 STAR WARS movie...A lonely boy (in this case a girl) find a droid with a mission,a old man teaches him,a new weapon come out to light,a final (but very boring in this case)battle in space to the new weapon...Sounds familiar isn't?...That is what you gonna see.My friends was surprise that i take very calm the disappointment of this movie and that was because a come to see it extremely neutral...I don't expected much and that what i receive.Yes...The movie is very entertainment but that's it!.if you come to see something new like ST:the clone wars or ST:rebels...Believe me that's cartoons have more imagination that this movie.For the record:EPISODE I is a lot better that this movie.",5,19,33,18 December 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," 'Amazing...One of the best sequels of the last decade'
","John Wick becomes one of the best action movies of the last ten years because the story,the action,the characters and of course Keanu Reeves.Even that the first movie wasn't a box office champ,in rents and sales of DVD and BLU RAY become a huge hit and quickly becomes a cult movie.Now the sequel is simply AMAZING...The action are dazzling because here is no CGI or something like that here is stunt persons fighting mano a mano and Reeves take part of that (Reeves make about 80% of the stunts according to the director) so the action take you to another level.The casting is great too besides the magic and great interpretation of Reeves we have Ruby Rose,John Leguizamo,Ian Mcshane and the reunion of Laurence Fishborne with Keanu since THE MATRIX trilogy.Believe me when i tell you that the movie worth every dollar you spend in the theater you wont be disappoint and you be waiting JOHN WICK 3 coming in the next years.",9,1,4,3 March 2017

",I remember to see this movie with my father(R.I.P)in theaters and in that time you don't know nothing about the movie is not like this times that you have magazinez and web to know everything about the movie so i was in 0 when i got to see it.Of course i see STAR WARS about 7 u 8 times and i was amazing when i see this movie i was open mouth..so dark so mysterius so thriller so tragic i mean everything in this movie was perfect.I can't believe that is almost 35 years of this movie and still looks great with new effects o not look's great!!!.That's why all the fans of SW knows that this is the best movie of the saga and simply one of the best sequels ever make in movie story!!!.,10,13,20,19 December 2013
Alien: Covenant," 'A big disappointment of Maestro Scott'
","I have to say that i am a HUGE fan of the ALIEN saga...and i always says that any movie have they own vision (yes! even ALIEN 3) so when i heard that Ridley Scott is coming back to the universe i can be more happy.I know that PROMETHEUS was a disappointment for a lot of fans but i personally like it because we see something different this time...not a another hide and chase ALIEN movie.Now CONVENANT was exactly the opposite...the movie feels like ALIEN:RESURRECTION 2 nothing new no surprises no nothing...at least PROMETHEUS have many new things...this movie not.And all coming from someone like SCOTT is even a huge low down...Now i not saying that the movie is bad...of course the movie have great special effects,a great cast,and of course a great direction...the problem is the script...you feel like 'i already see this before' and a huge down.If you want to see a original entry to the ALIEN saga...that's NOT what you gonna see...but if you want to see another chase and run entry like others ALIEN movies before...that's what you gonna see.",6,4,8,17 June 2017
