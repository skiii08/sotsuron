Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Just as good as the original
","When I first decided that I was going to go see this, I was kind of skeptical about it. Rob Marshall was the director and I knew he usually did musicals. That caused me to picture Jack Sparrow doing a dance while fighting with swords. As funny as that sounded, it just wasn't something I wanted to see on P4. Still, I decided to go see it anyways. Boy, was I glad I did! It was just as good as the original. There was an excellent balance of comedy and action. And all the actors were excellent too. Johnny Depp was excellent as always as Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush did an excellent job as Barbossa too. I have to say, however, I didn't like his look during most of the movie. He just looked to weird as a privateer. Thank goodness he changed back to his old look in the very end. Penelope Cruz did such a good job as Angelica. She made her seem like the type of woman you wouldn't want to get mad. Also, the actors Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey were great as Philip and Syrena. They really brought a spirit of youthfulness to the story. Finally, I have to say that Ian Mcshane did a great job as Blackbeard. I love how the brought in a real pirate as one of the characters. He gave the movie a sense of reality. Over all, I have to say that P4 is probably the best in the whole franchise. It is definitely worth going to see!",10,4,5,28 May 2011
The Hunger Games," Not the best adaption of a book, but not the worst either
","Before I watched the movie, knowing that Suzanne Collins wrote the screenplay, I thought that the movie would be one of the best movie adaptations of a book. I was wrong. Sure it was pretty good, but I've seen better movie adaptations of books come from screenplay writers that didn't write the book as well. Maybe that was what they should have done with the movie. Or it could be the fact that there were multiple writers. Sure, multiple writers are okay for an original screenplay, but when it's a screenplay that's being adapted from something, I think it might have been better with just one person writing it. It also felt rushed. I know that it would have been a lot longer if some things hadn't been cut, but the beginning especially seemed rushed. I think maybe they could have shown a little bit more of the reaping day. Even though I'm all for getting people to read, if someone had come to watch this without ever having read the first book, they wouldn't probably understand what was happening. One way they could have done that would have been by having a voice-over of Katniss talking about the Hunger Games. Now, I'm not saying it wasn't good, it was, but unlike with the Twilight Saga or the Harry Potter series, I don't feel like I want to go see a midnight premiere of it. I can't exactly put my finger on why it wasn't as good to me, but it just didn't seem as good. Now, I'm currently in the middle of reading the series for the first time, so, my perspective may change after I finish it.Also, the movie had a little too much gore for my tastes. True, I think I subconsciously censored what I saw in my mind when I was reading the book, but some of the stuff, I thought was pretty gruesome. Like, showing what the tracker jackers did to one of the tributes. I also didn't like when the showed Cato break the one tributes neck. Also, it seemed a little more gruesome because of the reason as to why they hold the games. Actually seeing it made it worse knowing that the career tributes had been raised to kill people and that the ones who weren't, had to kill others, whether they liked it or not.I think the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst movie ever.",8,0,3,20 April 2013
The Last Song," Great Movie!!
","This was a very good movie. Miley Cyrus played the part very well for her first lead role in something other than Hannah Montana. The cast really all seemed to fit into their roles really well. Liam Hemsworth did an excellent job too. Even though I have never seen any of Nicholas Sparks other movies or read any of his books, from how they are described, I think this movie is definitely a Nicholas Sparks movie. There are some times when you will cry. You'll laugh at some parts as well. Overall, this movie is definitely worth going to see. I will say though, it is definitely a chick flick. I don't think many guys will enjoy it. That is the only reason I gave it a 9 out of 10.",9,8,24,4 April 2010
Avatar," Not the best movie in the world, but not the worst either
","Avatar is a movie that I might watch one or two more times, but no more than that. It has great digital effects. The movie was not one of the best movies I've ever seen, but not the worst either. When I watched it, it took me a little while to get really interested in it. I honestly can see why some people like it and why some people don't. I think to really enjoy this movie a lot, you have to really be into the science fiction genre. All in all, I have to say that James Cameron could have done a little bit better. I honestly have to say that he did better when he made Titanic. My recommendation about Avatar is that you watch it once to see what your opinion is on Avatar.",7,0,5,19 June 2010
