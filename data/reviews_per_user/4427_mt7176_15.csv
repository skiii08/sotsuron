Mission: Impossible III," Best of the Series.
","No over the top epic film between good and evil. No over the top fantastical settings or creatures running around with super powers. Just a good old action film with a couple fun twists and J.J Abrams's (the director)presentation of the story, with excellent pacing, makes this film even better than the first one. The original may have that incredible sequence in the CIA safe room, but the story in the new one has a lot more heart to it and the sequences are not as drawn out as the sequences in the first one.As for Tom half of the dreaded Tom Kat! Well actually he's pretty darn good in it. The man knows how to pick good movies to make. In fact the reason why he has stayed at the top for so long is that he knows how to make and star in the big films like this. Its just a shame that recent public antics have detracted many from seeing this film.However I have something to say about that...So you find Tom Cruise a little flaky lately but hey...who isn't, especially in Hollywood? Get over it people. So he gives all his money to a sci-fi convention that dresses up as a religion and said Brooks Shield is a pill popping psycho. Who cares, really. I mean in the grand schemes of things how bad is it really to disagree with Matt Lauer (who is p-whipped by Katie Couric)on TV or jump up and down and act like an ass in front of the world when your in love. Not really all that bad. So he's a phooey or a wacko...but he's an actor...a celebrity...and the last time I checked, as good as an actor as he is, Johnny Depp isn't the pillar of normalcy either. As hard as it may be to remove the images of Tom Cruises recent public debacles, please try to. Because if you do you might just enjoy a really good summer time thrill.",10,1,3,27 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 4 years later and critics still are harping on Phantom Menace.
","OK its 2003.  4 years after the Phantom Menace and still the critics are harping on Episode 1.  Now it may not have been the best film ever made or even the best Star Wars film but it is by far not the worst sequel ever made as E online would have you to believe.  It even beat out BATMAN AND ROBIN for the dubious honor.  BATMAN AND ROBIN is a film where everyone involved deserved to be locked away for there total lack of effort and respect towards the source material, from the acting to the writing to the set design, to the direction.  Now when I went to see Episode 1 I wasn't let down because I was skeptical going into the film.  With all the buzz and all the interviews Lucas was giving back in 1999 I had already written off Phantom Menace as some half-baked predecessor to the original films and one which all the bandwagon people would jump for the joy because it would have nothing but neat computer effects like the Matrix.  I also got thrown for a loop in 1999 because all of a sudden it was cool to like Star Wars.  While Lucas does prefer good visuals over good dialogue I still felt that a story was being told, all be it a little jumbled.  And yes even though I find things in the Phantom Menace that cause me to roll my eyes it does not make me hate the film like all the bandwagon fans and critics out there do.I have no problem in saying that I admire George Lucas and what he is continuing to do with the Star Wars franchise.  He didn't sell out to all the sci-fi geeks who wanted to see Star Wars turn into Star Trek and managed to keep the films enjoyable fantasy for all ages especially concerning the love story.  I like the fact that Anakin and Padme get married in the second film instead of just falling in love and having the twins out of wedlock.As for other high profile films' whose sequels failed to live up the hype and were not on that worst sequel list. How about Star Trek 3, 5, and Nemesis and the Matrix Reloaded.",Null,2,4,2 June 2003
Batman Returns," Yes kids, it can be fun to play in the dark!!!
","I loved the summer of 1992 for one reason and that reason was Batman Returns.  Tim Burton had reached the pinnacle of direction and was just a year a way before he would reach it as a producer with Nightmare Before Christmas.  This, more than the original Batman and Edward Scissorhands cemented the director's legacy in Hollywood as the 'Gothic Director of Pop Culture'.  Looking back this is GREAT for lovers of TIM BURTON FILMS but BAD NEWS FOR LOVERS OF THE FIRST TWO BATMANS.  You see with a combine effort many critics, so-called Batman fans who actually had not read a comic book in over 20 years, and neurotic parents joined forces to bury this film.  There were claims of it being too dark, too morbid, and too vulgar.  The last complaint really upset me because the movie's innuendos were no more potent than a 1960's James Bond film. Because of these complaints and the fact that the sequel was not the success that the original Batman had been, even though it still made over 160 million dollars domestically, Warner Brothers decided to go in a lighter direction with the following two sequels.  Everything in this film works.  It plays up on the theme of the original Batman film, that the so called 'normal world' can be a scary freaky place and that in it your hero is more likely going to be some ordinary guy with problems, trying to save the day for his own personal and some times disturbing reasons.  Nothing against the other super hero movies but that is what made the Batman movies cool and Tim Burton knew it. 
The look of this film is more a Burton and designer Bo Welch creation than a traditional comic book setting but the same can be said about Anton Furst's sets designs in the first Batman.  Once again the film makers took the spirit of the comic book worlds of roof top battles and brought into a film-noir world that worked on the big screen. Now one complaint I can sympathize with NON-BURTON critics is with the Penguin.  It seems that Burton and screenwriter Daniel Waters simply took the character's comic book name and disregarded everything else about him. Instead of the comic book creation, we get a villain that could have come out of any horror flick.  I can understand the aggravation that some true to the bone Batman fans might have felt over the Penguin but it also forces me to ask those fans a question.  How else would you make a villain such as the Penguin, who is fat and short, an entertaining match for Batman?  The way Tim Burton approached the Penguin was the only way it could work outside of turning the villain into a mob boss and the first Batman had pretty much done the whole mob thing. As for Catwoman, if you had a problem with either Tim Burton's spin on the character or Michelle Pfeiffer's performance than you are just not a very good judge of movies.  Catwoman was definitely a strength in Batman Returns. I would have loved if Tim Burton would have gotten to make the Catwoman movie.  It was the director who first brought it up but Warner Brothers dragged their feet and it looks highly doubtful that Burton will be involved or if even the film will ever be made.        I love Batman Returns.  It's a great Tim Burton movie.  Unfortunately it sparked an end to Burton's reign as Hollywood's golden director.  A year later the over-rated Spielberg would recapture the title and Joel Schumacher would be named the director of the third Batman.  The movies were never the same after that.  Still all is not wrong with the world.  The third Batman was decent but the fourth one was horrible, and Tim Burton would go onto make entertaining films such as Sleepy Hollow.  But still I wish movies would get back that quirky, imaginative, and sometimes dark edge that has been largely missing in movies in recent years.",10,0,1,26 July 2003
Spider-Man 3," Comic Book Movies & the number 3!
","What is it with comic book movies and the number 3...Superman 3 had Richard Pryor and Superman acting like a jerk.Batman 3 (that is Batman Forever for those of you who find the Batman titles hard to keep track of) had Jim Carey and Robin acting like a jerk...and now the third Spiderman where there is Topher Grace(Eric Foreman/ that's 70's show) and Tobey McGuire...Mr.Spiderman himself acting like a jerk.As perfect as Spiderman 2 was you knew 3 was at the very least going to be a bit of a let down...but jeez...this was down right mediocre. It was not so because it didn't have riveting action or moments of comedic levity as was the case in the prior two Spidermans. Its just with all the story lines going on nothing really came together. Just as you were about ready to get into this movie it jerks you away and throws you into another storyline. Spider-man was an A-Rated franchise but this last installment reminds me of those lesser comic book films like...the Phantom or the Shadow that were alright but never good enough for a sequel.It was very obvious that the studio factor was weighing in on this film. And this time the cash hungry executives said, 'To heck with a sensible story; instead, lets rev up the marketing on this celluloid cash cow. Lets keep every gimmick of the first two films in play, even though they really don't belong; while overplaying the romantic nonsense of boy catches girl, boy looses girl, boy ends up with best friend of boy, best friend turns out to be a bigger jerk, boy gets girl back. And because people do eventually tire of franchises after the third film lets jam-pack this movie with all the villains and subplots, and get all of the money out of it now. Of course any serious character development or finer plot details will have to be scrapped because there simply won't be any-time.' Geeze studio guys with all the extra junk, there was barely any time to actually see the real (Red & Blue) Spider-Man in action with his mask on. I mean 3/4 of the time Spider-Man is either with out his mask or its torn to shreds. What is in Tobey McGuires' contract; that there has to be so much face time? I mean its great to establish the humanity side of Spider-man but Tobey and the director, Sam Raimi, has really taken it too far and has made him into a....sissy boy.Bottom line is there is entertainment value to be had with this film. Heck its better than most shows on the networks. (TV is dumb, except for HOUSE) With that said, however,Spider-man 3 is just such the expected disappointment that I was hoping it would not be.",5,0,1,18 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Anakin is whiny? How about you nay sayers are whiny.
","Yes I must admit that I like the new Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace films.  I think for saying that I will be pelted with rotten fruit from critics who thinks that the new Star Wars films are wretched.  Yet friends I am not the Star Wars geek that you might label me.  No I am simply a lover of movies.  No not a film auteur just a fan of entertaining films.  I happen to find the Star Wars films very entertaining. I'm afraid it is you critics out there, who complain that the new Star Wars films fail to hold a light to the original trilogy, who are the Star Wars geeks.  You nit pick about how it is not well acted or it is not well written, or the special effects are fake.  The latter of complaints are...well...just plain slander or come from people who need to get glasses. One complaint, 'Yoda is not the same as CGI.'  No I have to say he's a lot better.As for comparing the new films to the original... In 1999 when the Phantom Menace came out I went in knowing that in no way was Lucas going to be able to recapture the magic of the original and he hasn't.  But that's OK.  Star Wars was made in a time when such films like it were a rarity and thusly Star Wars appeared as a breath of fresh air. Most films in the 70's and most of the 80's were dull, gritty, and low key, not to mention vulgar.  Star Wars in some way changed the summers at the cineplexes and now every film out there is trying to be the next big thing. And that is fine too.Yet the original Star Wars trilogy was not the best acted series of films, or the best written, or for that matter the most original.  They were not designed for you to serious ponder the meaning of life, or the conflicts of this world...No they were simply meant to transport you to another one.  A galaxy where fantasy thrives and where good and evil duke it out with colorful lightsabers and lasers.  To get majorly upset over such a thing is rather petty.  And to hear grown men at the end of the movie yell out loud how much Attack of the Clones, 'just sucked,' is rude and becoming of a true whining brat.In all fairness I will say that yes these news Star Wars films are flawed but so is just about every other film out there.  And for the love story, yes it lacks some charm that was found in Empire Strikes Back, but I'll take it over that three hour mess that was Titanic.In its defense I will say that Attack of the Clones was adequately casted all the way.  Hayden Christansen, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel Jackson all get high marks.  As for George Lucas...True, he is a better producer than he is a director or writer but he is still a good movie magic maker, and John Williams still has the force when it comes to bringing the music of the film to life.Over all I give Clones a strong B+",Null,0,0,27 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," T3-What's with all the hate?
","...I mean I wouldn't say that the scene with the patrol car was not deserving being mentioned of Terminator more memorable moments. The TX robot from the back seat shoves her arm through the driver of the car, impaling the poor guy, in order to steer the car. I'd say the shock value of the other two pictures were still present.I actually enjoyed the films, they're all about the same to me. Cameron gets the props for coming up with the story but the new director and cast didn't do a bad job for the third installment. I view these films in the same manner as Jurassic Park, which is loud, action filled popcorn escape films where for some reason you enjoy seeing people getting eaten or eating the other end of a shotgun barrel. Its just good old fashioned summer time violence. Ahhhhh.",8,0,0,14 September 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," X3! A grand finale or is it?
","In the last couple of years the fan boys have taken over the movie gossip news and if anything doesn't meet with their satisfaction they completely write it off and do all in their powers to bring the film down. Well I'm hear to say to all those fan boys...GET A CLUE and perhaps a life.I thought X3 was going to be terrible from all the news I heard. The film was rushed, the effects were bad, and the new director was a joke. WRONG!!! This film continues right where the second film left off and just as the second film raised the bar set by the first film so does this one and then it successfully brings the film to a satisfying conclusion. In fact the Sunday afternoon crowd I was surrounded by applauded loudly at the end of the film. It was a crowd pleaser for all and not just the fan boys.The reason why I liked the XMen movies is because in order to bring the films to the silver screen the directors and screenwriters of these films weren't afraid to do actual adaptation or refinement to make the world they're portraying more dramatic. They're not afraid to take the source material and separate what translates well into a film and what does not and throw the latter away. As much as I liked the Spider-Man movies they always seem to me like I was watching a video comic-book. Sometimes staying too close to the source material keeps the characters in the film from jumping off the screen.Everything from the acting, sets, direction, effects were all very well done. Also the soundtrack to this film is a Grade A, classic movie score.If you haven't seen this film and you like the X-Men movies or just a good summer film then go see it. You'll be glad you did. Of course you should also stay till the credits end. Its not the biggest payoff in the world but it does make you wonder if this truly was the X-Men's last stand.",10,26,47,28 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Two Towers is Three Hours of FUN!
","Let me just say this movie was good.  How good?  Well it made three hours seem to go by as if they were only 2 hours.  The only time I was dissapointed was when it was over.  I was like, 'No, it can't be over. Please, I want some more!'  It ends much in the same fashion as the first film ended and if you are just a poor slob like me it will have you wanting more.  I wouldn't say it was any better than the Fellowship movie but it is definately as good.As well the first film actually I think is a little darker in tone and this new film is more action oriented and has less to do with a foreboding mood. In this film the characters are just thrusted into the events that are happening and in the midst of it there are pockets of humor which lightens the film up a bit.Things to look forward to is the battle of Helm's Deep.  It was just as I imagined while I was reading the books for the first time last year and so was the case with the Ents storming Sarauman's tower.  Absolutely breathtaking.  I know there were some changes such as the elves showing up to fight along with men but these sorts of changes were to serve the film. Lets face it the books are wonderfully written but in order to make them work on film you have to do a bit of adapting and summarizing.  All and all the film is faithful to Tolkiens world and the ideals behind it.
The new characters were good additions to the film and were played with talented actors.  Especially the man who played the king of Rohan.  They along with the bantering between Legolas and Gimli and Aaragon and the struggles of Frodo and Sam keep you interested for the first two hours before you get to the epic battle scenes.  The more fantastical creatures like the ents and Gollum are enjoyable to watch but I really don't think they take center stage nor should they.In the end I walk away with the same feeling as I did with the Fellowship film.  Peter Jackson has done one of the most brilliant jobs in film making and LORD OF THE RINGS IS GREAT.",10,0,0,18 December 2002
Transformers," Transform This!!!
","1st I would like to say...(spoiler) the masturbation reference was way out of a line for a film based on a children cartoon. Hey its just me...but I don't think that had to be in there.With that said everything else in this film rocked. This was not a kids movies for every generation but one specially made for those who grew up watching the original cartoon. Now I've read several fan boys whining how the new movie wasn't 100% faithful to the source material...but keep in mind the source material was a cartoon serial based on a toy line...Really not much to go on, but still the film makers referenced the key elements that endeared a generation to the Transformers of old. Optimus Prime was still the GIANT HERO with that same strong voice who faced the most dangerous foes to save humanity. He's like George Washington as a Big Rig. He leads on the front lines.The Autobots (though not identical looking and sounding as their cartoon counter parts) still have distinct personalities and styles. The cars are all GM vehicles too...though not accurate to the cartoon...Bumble Bee is better as a Camaro than a Bug and Jazz is still cool looking as Solciste. The action was very big. Like a transformer movie should be and like its more adult counterparts (Terminator movies) people get hurt and people die. Buildings are demolished, vehicles cut in half, explosions huge. The editing was a little too fast paced and left me in need of my bottle of Advil but still pretty solid.The Decepticons are lethal. They're not cartoon villains here. They kill. They want you dead. They find your existence disgusting. In other words 'evil.' No gray areas here. I think they spent more times on the Autobots design than they did on the Decepticon because they look a little generic and it was hard to differentiate between Megatron and Starscream which in the cartoon was no problem. I thought Megatron's voice, for not being the original, was pretty good, but they could have gotten a little closer to Starscream. In many of the episodes, he stole the show with his scheming and his weaselly voice. Lastly the story is essentially ripped from Independence Day...but then Independence Day was ripped from War of the Worlds. In other words, typical sci-fi, good vs. evil storyline. Good, solid and works well for the blockbuster film. The human character-development in this film actually helps in the audience connecting with the CGI characters (Transformers). The simple storyline of a boy and his first car (Bumblebee) is quite endearing. After all, the Autobots of old weren't just the good guys because they fought the bad guys they were good because they liked the people they protected and cared for them and in return the humans were grateful and help them. Over all if you're 13 and up you are going to want to see this movie. If you're a 30 something kid who wants to relive the glory days of your youth in the 1980's (the best decade ever to be a kid) then get in line and see this movie.",8,1,3,7 July 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," What is the Matrix Reloaded?
","The Matrix Sequel overall is a good movie.  Not surprisingly it does what all middle films do in a trilogy it raises the stakes and leaves you hanging at the end of the film.  Much like Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars Trilogy, the Matrix Reloaded also changes the perceptions of the film series.  Although the change here is far less dramatic.I think what weakens the film was all the time they spend in Zion in the first half of the film.  It wasn't really necessary to spend 5 minutes in a montage of rave dancing and love making.  Nor was it necessary for the passionate speech to the masses given by Morpheus.  I prefer the more subtle and mysterious manners that the character displays while he is in the Matrix world.  Outside of the drawn out love scene the love story between the Neo and Trinity works well and provides a nice reversal of roles from the first film.  This time out Neo knows whats going to happen and has to save Trinity.   The film is good but it is much like all the other sequels that are out there right now.  It is yet another middle film in yet another trilogy.  We all come to expect some twist in the middle film now and you do get it here. Trilogies, over all are becoming tiresome and in a sense a genre all to themselves.  That said Matrix Reloaded is a worthy entry into the franchise and will most likely will further immortalize the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix creators, due to the large success that the film is going to be.",7,0,0,15 May 2003
War of the Worlds," Intense if not scary.
","By far Spielberg's best effort in a long time. War of the Worlds in a way felt like a cross between his two films that he made in 1993, Jurassic Park and Schindlers List. The aliens with their low, resonating hum and death rays that turns people into dust are as impressive if not more scary than those dinosaurs from the park. As well the feeling of hopelessness I experienced as I viewed the people in this film fight to stay alive was something similar I felt when I viewed those black and white scenes of Germans executing Jews. Plus there were those scenes of horror stricken people fleeing that were similar to what was viewed for real on 9/11. Bottom line, this movie should have you at the edge of your seat.Even though this is science fiction, it is HG Wells who was a remarkable writer who wrote as much for entertainment as he did to express his concern for the progress of the human condition in mondern times. Plus Spielberg has a talent for adding weight to the most frivolous of action scenes. Even though this film had lasers and explosions, you knew this film was not about such things but about humans in times of crisis.I'm not necessarily 100% sold on the films portrayal on the dark nature of the human condition when people are facing such peril. 9/11 showed us people could come together but to be fair we have also seen in such a short amount of time how this nation once again has turned on itself. Plus this film also pits all of humanity against the forces of extinction which is something incalculable or impossible to foresee accurately; therefore, Spielberg's presentation of a dark and raw struggle to stay alive is quite plausible if not realistic.There are some minor questions that any viewer may come up with when watching this film if you get wrapped up in the logic of science fiction. For instance why did it take the aliens a million years to strike and how come they didn't know about bacteria if they are such an advanced species. My answer to those questions are not to answer them but to simply except them as the events of a science fiction plot. Plus there is a bigger point about the bacteria than science has to offer. That point is stated in the wonderful prologue at the end of the movie, 'God in his infinite wisdom...' Some things in life man can not control and it is at such times of peril and/or devastation that man must reach beyond his own projections of what he can do and cling to hope and faith.",10,8,12,5 November 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," As Intelligent as it is Enjoyable.
","I never thought I live to see the day that I would say, Will Ferrel is starring in a smart movie. So now that hell has frozen over (not really, but still) I can not understand why this film did not do better with the awards shows. I mean I saw Little Miss Sunshine because everyone was raving about it but I didn't think this film was particularly clever, or engaging I only thought it was a well constructed film that is ultimately pathetic because of it subject matter; a dysfunctional family who have no redeeming qualities outside of the fact that they stick together. Yet it is Little Miss Sunshine that gets the nod from critics and the academy.The characters in Stranger than Fiction are normal 9 to 5'ers who go about living their lives as most of us do. There is our star Harold who is the boring IRS agent who needs to loosen up. Ana the baker who who recklessly tries to make the world a better place by not paying the IRS its full amount in taxes, (a hearty cheer from me for her stance on taxes). The Professor who decides to deduce the identity of the voice in the IRS agents head as well as acting as a life coach. And the Narator herself who is a brilliant author who kills off every character in her books. Like all great stories you want to be interested in the people you're devoting two hours to and all these characters have engaging personalities.The characters all gravitate around the plot of Harold hearing the voice of the Nararator in his head. Through out the movie the film keeps you guessing whether Harrold really exist or is he a figment of the author's imagination and vice versa but it turns out that they both are real and this is a real situation. By the end of the film the story is not about the voice inside of Harrold's head but facing the truth of certain aspects and/or situations in these characters' lives. In the end both Harold and the Narrator both learn to be free of their ruts in life by stepping up and doing what is right and noble. In the end both mild manner Harold and the acclaimed author sacrifice their selves for the greater good and because of it you walk out of that film feeling better than when you left it.",10,2,4,27 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the Bunch? Or is it too soon to judge?
","Star Wars is the best. Empire Strikes Back is the best over all or at least I use to think that and perhaps down the road I will continue to think that but I have to say I really liked the last Star Wars. In fact I love it. I keep on watching it in on DVD and every time I do I can tune out the rest of the world. Very few movies I can actually do that with. Since I could remember my favorite movie has always been Empire Strikes Back and it has had a lot of competition over the years (Willow, Back to the Future, Batman, Untouchabels, Braveheart, Dick Tracy, Lord of the Rings.) And as much as I have raved about these other films that I love they could not replace that special little place in my movie lovers heart where the Empire reigns. (Valiant heroes going through an onslaught of trials and perils, fighting back a relentless and enormous enemy, but now with Sith we can see how the enemy first took power over people and the world's they live in and it is brilliant.) I think over all Revenge of the Sith will fall just beneath Empire but it is just a step below it. Sith is everything I hoped it would be and I give it a 10.",10,1,6,19 November 2005
X2: X-Men United," X2 follows through. (spoilers)
","X2 is a success largely in part because it decides not to follow the path of traditional comic book movie sequels and just reinvent itself every three or four years like the Batman franchise.  XMen is not Batman or Superman.  XMen from my past observations of the cartoon  always seem to be a sci-fi soap opera.  The director, who is very wise, decided to take that premise and provide us with a much larger picture turning the comic book franchise into a sci-fi epic similar to the original Star Wars Trilogy.  In the first film we are introduced to the main characters and there is a hint of a larger story.  The second film we move into the larger story and we find our heroes up to there necks in trouble.  Not to mention a beloved character is presumably lost only to be presumably reborn later on, much like Han Solo in Empire Strikes Back and Spock in the Wrath of Kahn.  Does this make the film run the risk of being formulaic?  Well yes but comic books are formulaic to begin with.  What makes this interesting is that this film throws off the shackles of the comics' limitations and sets out to create an epic series of films and yet it maintains the inspiration and the spirit of this unique creation from Marvel.  The one casualty of this view of film making is that sometimes beloved characters of the comics are not that dominant in the movie or just completely excluded.  Cyclops is in this film is in the beginning and at the end but he was widely excluded from the middle portion of the film.  The director used common sense and reasoned that if there was no need for a character in the scene then he or she needed not to be on screen.  Unlike the Batman Franchise or the Superman Franchise the story takes precedence over a character's screen time. The only thing that seemed to be taken from the Batman films was to make all the costumes black.",10,0,0,2 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This is not a film. This is a fantasy.
","In 1977 when Star Wars came out it was the biggest thing to happen to movies in a very long time.  Star Wars was a science fiction film that focused on escapism rather than scientific lore that usually weighs down other sci-fi films.  Instead of explaining everything through the actors dialogue Lucas just showed us with sophisticated direction, set designs, and special effects.  Still if it was not for Empires Strikes Back the Star Wars saga would not have achieved the level of pop culture status that it now enjoys, for if it was Star Wars that introduced us to the worlds and the main characters of the original trilogy it was Empire Strikes back that gave us the entire theme of Star Wars saga.  It clearly showed us the struggles of the good and power of the evil.  The empire is just not a government body to be despised but to be feared as well.  The Empire is a collected evil who iss everywhere.  The story also reveals much more in terms of who Luke actually is, of his gifts, and how he could be a candidate for either good or evil.  As well it hints at the connection between Luke and Leia and of course reveals the Luke and Vader connection.  Plus this film through color and music and the interweaving of character development and action sequences swings us a way from the space opera frivolity of the first film and sends us through a mystical fantasy both dark and beautiful, dangerous and brilliant.  Last of all the writing in the film elevated the saga in a way that no other Star Wars film has been able to do.  Leigh Bracket and Lawrence Kasdan worked wonders in their screenplay.  Instead of soaking some serious and more romantic moments with dialogue that is heavy worded we get moments that are mixed with clever one liners and situations that forces Han and Leia to fall in love.  I wish I could say the same about Attack of the Clones love story, which was fine but failed to capture that sort of chemistry.In short this films is a masterpiece and one that has not been matched.  It has not been matched in memorable characters, plot revelations, atmosphere, or music.  Although few films have come very close they all still fall short of this one fantasy.",10,0,1,21 January 2003
