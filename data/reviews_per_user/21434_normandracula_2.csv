","OK, here's the pitch. A group of evil film makers plot to cross Blade Runner with Groundhog Day and end up creating a soulless and cynical exercise in viewer manipulation that does very well at the box office. No, wait, we've forgotten to include Minority Report. Within the first eight minutes you know with 99.999987% certainty pretty much everything that's going to happen. Which is that our soulful and anguished hero is going to get the mad bomber and the kookie girl; all that's required to make this happen is some routine investigation, some ludicrous science, some some stock characters, an ersatz moral dilemma, so-so special effects and a laughable yet nauseating feelgood ending. In other words, all the required elements of a standard studio movie. No, no, it still not quite there .. maybe we make our guy a captain in the US army who fell out with his dad and got killed in a heroic and patriotic fashion outside Kandahar .. Greenlight!It can't be just me who longs for a sci-fi film that wasn't fathered by accountants, written by computers and tested on demographic cross sections of the Californian public wired up to electrocardiograms. Why can't the hero end up handcuffing the mad girl and kissing the kookie bomber? Or anything with the tiniest, most minuscule hint of authentic creative thought. Dream on.",Null,4,8,10 August 2011

","Do you have very little idea what happened in the second world war? Do you think the American army spent April 1945 struggling to hold the line against a resurgent Wehrmacht? Do you think anti-tank guns were knocked out by tanks trundling towards them very slowly? Do you think Platoon would have been a better movie if Chris Taylor had fallen in love with Sergeant Barnes? Do you think pro-war movies are more entertaining by far than anti-war movies? Do you think the only good woman is a dead one? Do you think America would have won in Vietnam if it hadn't been stabbed in the back by the liberal media? Do you think the central message of Christianity is to kill your enemies? Did you think 300 was a historically accurate depiction of the battle of Thermopylae? Do you vote Republican and own a dog and worry about being flooded by immigrants? Do you suffer from erectile disorder? You'll love this movie.ps: I have given four stars for set design and artistic direction, both of which were very good, but as I gave the movie itself minus three, only one of them is visible.",1,26,56,31 October 2014
