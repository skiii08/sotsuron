The Devil's Advocate," Thank God For Pacino
","Alright, lets be reasonable here.  The movie's not that bad, it's entertaining and fun to watch, but it's not a >great< film.  As far as suspense and thrillers go nowadays, 'Devil's Advocate' is pretty run-of-the-mill.  While I think it's a great concept, the movie's hindered by a flashy script, overdone special fx, and too many stale cliches to keep me intrigued. However, it's probably worth watching just for Pacino's incredible monologue at the climax. .  He saved this movie from being just another basic cookiecutter thriller that Hollywood is cranking out one after another.  Thank God for Al, where would we be without him?",Null,0,1,27 October 1999
The Insider," Unfortunate
","This could have been a really terrific movie.  The acting was amazing and the story was well written.  Unfortunately Michael Mann's direction was awful.  I'm not quite sure what happened, since he did such a good job with 'Heat.'  In 'The Insider' he constantly uses awkward focusing techniques and hand-held cameras- it's like watching 'The Blair Witch Project' but worse because you're trying to follow a complex plot, but people's heads keep shifting in and out of focus, and the camera keeps zooming around in blurry close-ups, that I got dizzy every scene.  The movie was too long at almost 3 hours, it could have easily had 30 minutes or so cut. The problem is I really liked this movie.  I was looking forward to it, Mann's awkward direction and often out-of-place music cues detracted a lot from this film- I can only honestly give it ** out of **** stars.  Its a real shame, this could have been an incredible movie.  Pacino, Crowe, and especially Christopher Plummer were fantastic.  Really unfortunate.",6,0,1,7 November 1999
