Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I Loved It!!!!!!!!
","I have to keep this simple and say that I really enjoyed this film. I think that when people start tearing it apart over trivial things like, Amidala had lipstick on her teeth, or Obi Wan's hair was longer in one scene, have missed the entire point of the film. Look at it through the eyes of a child, and you will see what is meant to be seen. This is not an epic of Darth Maul, George Lucas does not 'owe' anyone anything. This is his vision, and I think he executed it beautifully. I look forward to the next 2 films..Keep up the good work George!!!!!",10,6,8,27 May 1999
