Vertigo," A far fetched plot
","A cop retires from services because he has vertigo. And another guy decides to use this fact to plot the murder of his own wife, by making up a story that his wife is possessed by a woman who died like a century ago. Seems like a far fetched plot. But it works, because it's Hitchcock. There's romance. There's mystery. There's drama. And there is the old world charm of San Francisco in the 50s. Worth a watch!",7,0,0,13 October 2019
Us," So bad
",This movie is unbelievably bad. I don't know what Jordan Peele was smoking when he came up with this script. It is utterly pointless. I can't believe this is the same guy who came up with Get Out last year.,2,0,0,11 June 2019
Room," Totally avoidable
","This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of 'Life is Beautiful' unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to watch.",2,124,300,27 December 2015
Limitless," I need me some NZT
","A drug that puts your entire brain to use? That's the drug I have been looking for all my life. So I was super keen on watching this movie. It didn't disappoint. It was every bit of the crazy ride I would expect it to be. The super-highs of being able to use your brain to its maximum potential. The terrible lows of withdrawal. The dangers of getting mixed up with the wrong people and rubbing powerful people the wrong way. This movie portrayed all of these brilliantly. What I liked even better was that the movie didn't take a preachy 'don't do drugs, it's bad for you' turn towards the end. In fact, Eddie goes on to become the senator and still continue to pop the magic pill. Great movie.",7,0,0,23 June 2018
