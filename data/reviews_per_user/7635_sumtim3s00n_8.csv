Hereditary," Overrated,depressing rather horrifying and meanders along like a lazy river
","I love a good horror, especially since theyre few and far inbetween. This one however, boy how it stretched on. And then at the end, they summarize and explain 2 hours in 15 seconds. Yeah, it doesnt work that way mr.director bossman, or at least it did not in this case. I dont know, it just felt stretched, Gabriel Bryne did ZERO acting in this movie, the mother was IMO horribly overplayed and seriously annoying as the neurotic mess and not very realistic. I get her pain but come on. The movie was more depressing than horrifying. No one in this family obviously could communicate with each other, they all just hated eachother passive agressively and went their way. 
I prefer movies that make sense, where you feel that that could be real and draws you in. Here, from the beginning It was one annoying thing about this stupid family after another.",Null,0,2,5 July 2018
Captain Marvel," Horrible bland film with the most miscast actress of any movie ever...
","I really hope the 7.2 score is done artificially by bots or whatever hacking magic and is not a testament to how extremly and absolutely bottom poor is the taste of general audiences today.
Cause this film has zero redeming points. The actress is as pleasant as nails on a chalkboard, the story about as entertainig as reading ingredients on your lollypop and the character she plays is confusing and already not that popular yet she makes it even worse. And this is coming from a big fan of this genre, Im honestly willing to forgive a lot.
However this is too much, what a horrible horrible movie, one of the worst I have watched. I prefer the Green Lantern with Reynolds any day of the week over this steaming pile of sh....",Null,128,236,14 April 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It is sad where the movie industry is going
","I was looking forward to the movie because good movies are really far in between these days. Johnny Depp is playing,that should be good I thought, really only remembering Depp and his wackiness from the first part.People are becoming increasingly confused in these times, wanting more and more intensity from things, wanting everything instantly to occupy them, things to distract them from their thoughts.This movie is just too typical of that to be even funny. We have action sequences stretched out beyond anything enjoyable, there is absolutely no depth to anything in the movie, you could be a mushroom and still understand everything happening on the screen. It was like watching formula 1 these days. Bland, no likable characters, no passion , no nothing. Just something happening. Great CGI and technical perfection. No good dialogs, no real background of anything or anyone, no intelligent humor, It just has no essence. I don't remember yawning so hard coming out from the cinema.",Null,5,11,28 July 2006
Avengers: Endgame," Almost ruined by super annoying Brie Larson
","Jar Jar deserves an oscar compared to her. Her presence on screen makes you want to walk out. Not to mention the film is already filled to the brim with unncessary huge number of 'strong' female characters to the point its absurd. And not cool, awesome strong female characters like Rene Russo's character, whom you believe is a bada5s and has depth.
So female Jar Jar aside (an insult to Jar Jar actually), the movie, the first half, is pretty darn good, with many great comical moments especially. Second half and especially the last third, it slows down and starts becoming the formulaic and typical hollywood film, full of empty fighting, streched out beyond all sensible constraints. The ending is also not very insipiring or clever.
Also at times it suffers from some quite bad writing. Like when Thor presents Valkyrie with Asgard as if it is this great gift to her. Remember Asgard, a majestic, wonderful city on a half waterfall, half clouds, with a rainbow and beautiful weather every day.
Asgard,that is NOW a small sh1thole of a fishing village, cold and damp 11 months out of the year, with pollution and just an overall miserable life. Who the F would want to be a queen of that ?
Anyway I dont see why it has such a high score, it definitely doesnt deserve it. Its not bad but its nothing special either with too many noticeable distractions that annoy you.",Null,18,33,25 April 2019
Before Sunset," Beautiful, sad, happy, real. Simply amazing.
","First I have to say that I haven't been this moved by a film for quite some time. At the first you notice that its not filmed in an ordinary manner. Its a dialog between Jesse and Celine. And if i would have known this before I might be put off from watching it. Don't be. In a way the whole dialog represents the way we think during our lives. It sums it up in a way. It is just so authentic. How we slowly become numb, maybe don't even realize it. Love turns out not to be what we expected but we never really stop hoping somewhere deep inside. We have dreams and we wish them to come true but reality drags us down. Having a dream, a strong wish, desire can be extremely hard and emotionally painful if it does not come true. It is just a burden, a perspective by which we weigh our experiences.But then again when we have our dreams come true, after a while,don't we just find ourselves wanting more ? Not necessarily. When you have experienced the good and the bad, you do not idealize that much anymore. It think it is about enjoying the simple things, honesty, joy, following your heart and not your ego, being a good person and living one day at a time. Made my day in any case.",Null,1,1,28 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A completely empty movie made for profit on a generic PC hollywood formula
","There is very little good to say about it. The movie is void of any significant story or dialogues, it lacks purpose and vision. Its rather an obvious and obnoxious mix of studio wishes for toy sales and trying to please as wide an audience as possible. So many things wrong dont know where to even begin. First of all, Jar Jar, the ever annoying horrible Jar Jar from previous movies at least had a purpose as a (very poor) comic relief character. The fluffy penguins in Last Jedi on the other hand are 100% transparently there for no reason but toy sales. 
The action trumps everything in the movie. I have nothing against good action but come on. And the characters are so blatantly cliche and repeating themselves. Luke, a seemingly wise Jedi, perhaps fed up with everything but how does that make him a miserable, cold, heartless bast*ard. All of the characters are so black and white, its mind numbing.
A good movie is a good movie, be it a simple comedic Thor Ragnarok or a thought provoking Matrix. But the Last Jedi is nothing of that, its a heartless product almost made by a (quality) hollywood generator machine working based on a formula of most prevalent cliches today and popular ideas/values. Also of course the SJW crowd had to have their say making all heroes,general,admirals whatever women and male hero black. And then throw in an asian sidekick,they mustnt be forgoten,that would be rasist. 
Its pathetic. The race or sex of characters shouldnt be forced,it should serve the story. It does anything but that here. It wasnt story first here. It was the marketing guy, the censor, the SJW representative and toy company. Only THEN came director,story,character.
Expect no sight or smell of anything original, thought provoking, tabboo breaking or good moral quandries. 
Just a lot of empty happening for 2 hours.",Null,20,29,16 December 2017
Midsommar," Long meandering story that doesnt deliver
","Not sure what this is supposed to be. Its definitely not a horror movie. Its not even that scary, has a few unsettling moments but thats it. Its just weird and doesnt really have any dramatic arc or raising the tension. Basically the whole movie is a few strangers saying WTF? constantly and everyone else telling them ' 'ts ok ! guys'
Also besides that, its revolves around a traumatized, annoying and totally without self respect girl that slowly starts benefiting from this weird place. Because of course, we cannot have a film these days without it being a 'personal journey' of some sorts. Writers trying to be smart and 'deep'.
Yeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going. Its just a weird film with no real ending, resolution, interesting character or events. Albeit with nice filmography and quite good actors it has no real dramatic structure or captivating story.",Null,729,1231,2 September 2019
Casino Royale," Incredible, back to the old days of cinema
","I had my doubts, before seeing the movie, wondered if it is going to be another stupid action flick as those with Brosnan, only this time with a good actor, on par with Connery or Moore. Hollywood these day is mostly just mindless, stereotypical action and witless dialogs.This Bond is everything that describes the opposite. Its witty, the fast paced scenes and slow ones are in very good balance and either being an action scene or a slow scene, it never ever gets boring or unimaginative. There are numerous funny and witty remarks and associations placed very delicately, precisely and do not stand out intrusively. Everything is done with quality in mind, in good taste. The word original can be even used, word that can be very seldom said about most Hollywood movies. It remains an action flick, its far from being a complex drama with a moral underlying the story. The movies gives us hope that mainstream action films can still be breathtakingly good. Oh, there are a few some advertisements for certain items placed strategically and an unnecessary or misplaced line here or there but that could be called nitpicking.All in all this Bond is incredibly good and I hope the sequels well follow in its footsteps.",Null,0,1,7 December 2006
