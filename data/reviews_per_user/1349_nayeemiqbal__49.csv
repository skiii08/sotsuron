10 Things I Hate About You," Good
","Another story of high school, we can connect to. The things we went through, set backs, dedication, sisterhood, friendship, love, plans of our little minds. The way high school shapes us. Whats on outside isnt what is inside. It takes one to know someone. Not understanding each other and lack of communication. Our mental biases and first impressions.

Dunkirk," Nolan makes everyone attentive
","The direction and non linear way of Nolan is great. Very few directors can make ordinary story so interesting. Bravo for that. The stories of soldiers in a war. The heroes outside the war. Ones will to survive. How bigger sacrifices change the tide of war. The people who evacuated the 300000 soldiers amidst the attacks. The sound, visuals are good. Historically more accurate as stated by some dunkirk veterans.",7,1,2,18 April 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Stage set for THANOS.
","With superheros growing, they collateral damage they do, the immunity they have, the world govt want them to sign an accord. But it creates a rift in the group. and it just goes deeper and deeper. The plot fails why all the way down for seeing the video. Otherwise good. Manipulative mastermind,Zemo, who lost his family, did all this in vengeance. Superheroes fighting each other(for a change). But revenge is not good. But will the heroes learn it or will the vengeance consume them?
It sets stage for THANOS because the team that can stop him is broken and now is the perfect time for his plan.The big question everyone asks? Who won civil war? IronMan or CaptainAmerica? But actually BlackPanther won the Civil War.",8,2,2,1 April 2020

But now they have a plan, ready to sacrifice and get along with their past differences which they lacked in Infinity War. Story goes total nuts. The time travel, retrieval of stones without actually disturbing the timeline but complicacy happens. The end fight is superb. The fallen are back and universe vs thanos happens. Who wins? You have to see this.
Completing the characters arc for many superheroes. IronMan, Vision, BlackWidow, Captain America. End of infinity stones chapter(fingers crossed). How they filmed the meetups during fight was good. Visual effects, sound were brilliant. and the wedding scene!
Returing the stones is a bit complicated and why it didnt disturbed the timeline? Rest is goooood.",9,3,11,31 March 2020
Gone with the Wind," Love, hope, war, struggle! Classic beauty
","Do big events like war changes you from inside or not. The effects of war. Will we ever forget our first love, missing our first shot. Suppresing the emotions for the happiness of our lover. Can we love again? The strangest of the situations can change people but is the change permanent. It focusses on a manipualtive and self centered woman and on contrast kind and loving woman. All the chances we get in our life, and when we finally understand our mistake, is it too late? Loyality, parenting, sisterhood, kindness, cruelty, money and everything in between. Who do we owe our loyality to, land or people? The perspective of women in a war. Even if it seems we lost all, do we?
The run-time of 4 hrs, and still captures your focus and attention. Too much life!",9,1,1,16 April 2020

P.S. Opening actually seems real war.",9,0,0,28 March 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," All the buzz of Infinity Saga! THANOS and infinity stones
","After the Thor ragnarok ending. Thanos is on his hunt for Infinity stones. Avengers are split up and without plan. Thanos has a plan, and a great one. Thanos is ready to sacrifice, but the Avengers arenot. Thanos snaps completing his destiny and removing half the life. This movie is about Thanos and all the setup that was set for him in Infinity Saga. Thanos is right in his conscious and is just watching the sunrise at his Garden!. He justifies the role of character.Black order is weak. They couldve been more fierce.
You have to deal with emotions and the deaths.
This shows if you have a plan, execution and will you can do anything. and also when to strike the enemy (at their weakest) and till now they havent lost and when they lost, they lose big time.!",9,1,2,30 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Cult movie on Mansion Family Murders
","Movie about television actor (his carrier is about to end) and his stunt double who has been by his side for so long. How he encourages him to be better and supports him everyway possible. The potrayal of being a good friend in real sense and how the hollywood was in 60s.
This movie is based on the the murders by Charles Mansion. This movie in itself reveals the Quentin Tarantino special effect of mess at the end.",8,1,1,17 March 2020
A Quiet Place," Family vs sound monsters?
","Apocalyptic world! how a family lives in silence against these monsters who kills anyone making sound. How together as a family, we can survive the difficult of the times. Each doing their small little parts for the better function ie survive. The measures the elder has to choose to survive. The emotions, acting, direction is classic.

Hidden Figures," Hidden figures still exists!
","The historical drama of colored people who has to get over bigger barriers to achieve their goals. The acting is good. How your vision should be. The problems faced by these people during that period and become an inspiration for generations to come due to their motive to acieve their goals. The change of heart in people and this is how you revolutionise the change. Acceptance.
The fun part is NASA saying they arent hidden figures no more, but they forget they are the ones who made them HIDDEN FIGURES.",7,0,3,18 April 2020
1917," One of the best WW1 movie
","One shot. Movie about saving fellow armymen from falling into a trap. So two brave persons into no mans country zone. Time. Thrill. Action and emotions...
This also shows why he had won the medal and sold it for some drinks. He is fierce, uses his mind over emotions, and makes the duty prime along with saving his life. The other person, is too innocent, soft and why war shouldnt happen reflects in his character. He doesnt belong to war but he needs to save his brother and cant think of any other thing...
Will they be able to save the fellow armymen?!",8,1,2,24 March 2020
8 Mile," Slow but some sparkling moments!
","Young man struggling with his life, job, love-life and everything, and how he gets out of that.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Revenge and mess!
","Sometimes revenge is good and what they did to her, but she is alive and she comes for them hard. Many ends are open yet (to be seen in part 2). Tarantino's mess & chaos is seen all over, and mingled many cultures. He loves it and so does we! We break certain promises for the better good, but will good be done. We have to see. Too much killing and action. After all she is 'Black Mamba'
Why is she still alive? A question to ponder over?",8,0,0,16 April 2020
Prisoners," Super emotional
","Daughters of two friends gets kidnapped on holidays. The pain the families go through is intense. The detective and the father go on together to find the girls. But it is often the suspect isnt the criminal. The father goes beyond his limits trying to find the daughters. The frustation, the sadness, emotions and the faith is checked?!.
How one accident (which may be a test from God), we fail and become the puppets of demon. Will we be awarded for our hardwork and patience. Will they be abke to find their daughters?!
The acting by Hugh is too realistic.",9,0,0,8 April 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Benchmark for space-travel movies!
","In 1968, this concept and vision of director is commemdable. The cinematography and visualisation shown is great. The story is complex. His view of intelligent beings, the advancement in technology and the reliability. The story comes full circle at end till then you are unaware of anything. Evolution, space-travel, technology, intelligent beings all in one cinematic saga. No dialogues are bit odd but this is his way of creating an idea. Things we are unable to understand and grasp! Will you be able to grasp this?! watch this space odyssey",8,0,0,18 April 2020
Avatar," CGI is on and real.
","The change of hearts, sacrifice for ones own land, things we dont understand, love, compassion and corporate scum. The fight is incredible. The visuals are also good.

The new dimension added to our world in the cinematic universe.",8,1,1,17 April 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Sinister world

A Clockwork Orange," You'll be psychologically disturbed after this!
","The life of a hooligan. The law, justice, revival, experiments, government policies and reforms in a psychological manner. The laws of karma at the work. Revenge. The narration have a lot of effect on you. Acting is very good. What have we become as a society!. The acceptance by the society after our redemption from something bad? Government not caring for the individual/group but just their ratings. Medias impact on people and their crooked interests. Does free will matters?
You will be left disturbed at the end with a lot to ponder about.",8,0,1,17 April 2020
Les Misérables," Revolutionary Musical
","Is law always right. The revolution, the resistance, oppressor and support. The stories of different people and how our kidness affects other one. Bigger sacrifice leads to bigger rewards. Kindness is the answer. We always catch up with our past, no matter what. The things we do when the things we believed is all shattered up. The end gives you goosebumps. Good",8,0,0,22 April 2020
A Beautiful Mind," John nash and his beautiful mind.

Inception," Well Nolans another masterpiece
","The movie about the thief who steals secrets, plants ideas via dream sharing technology. All Cobb wants is to go meet his children but can he?
Getting a team for planting inception(idea); but the execution doesnt go as planned, and improvising along the way. He is the best in dream-sharing because he has spent a lot of time there along with his wife. He knows what to do and what not to. But she(dead) is still in his mind and tries to spoil the execution.
The ending is open for you to think... Did the totem falls or not... Well he doesnt care... Because he is with his children. I think it falls. He is in the reality.
The visual effects are exhilarating.",9,2,3,26 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Brilliant!
","The story of a man who gets jail for the crime he didnt do. He is straight as an arrow but inside jail he has to become the crook to get along. He is brilliant, intelligent, humble and with hope, which is a dangerous thing. He uses his intelligence to help the officers inturn for the favor to his friends. The friendship he makes with his group. Then he finds out he can win the case but things turn turtle and you cannot imagine the surprise it pulls right before your eyes!

Parasite," Cult about the social class division in South Korea?!
",So watched the Korean movie Parasite. It is about poor family conning their way up into a wealthy family and things just go wild as the mystery unfolds. Nothing to take anything from BongJoonHo the big climax ending has the same flavor of cult like that of Tarantino. The chaos we all thrive for is served well. The whole movie is the buildup for this and he has been able to do it in his own chaotic way! Chaos?!,8,0,2,17 March 2020
Marriage Story," Separation and the process...
","Looking through a divorce from an inch sized picture frame. The movie is good. The acting is great.
The process of separation of the partners and the wrong decisons we make along the way. They still care about each other. They are good and loving people but divorce isnt for them and it hurts. The toll it takes. Ome of the reasons I hate lawyers, making things more crazy than they actually are. Finally getting to the square one where we should have started. The important decisions, if we only be reasonable, can make our life smooth. Finally raising of a child by two miserable parents.",8,1,1,7 July 2020
Black Panther," Simple yet amazing
","The african black superhero finally gets a movie. A family issue and two cousins fighting for becoming the king. Its all about the secret they have been hiding and should they share it with world or not. The complicacy a simple mistake unattended will do is clearly shown. How a single bad decision turns your whole world turtle. The family is united to all issues and which is I love about this movie. The brother and sister relation seems a real one. The endquote is awesome.
The technology they have makes Earth finally able to fight a bigger war which is what happens in Infinity War.",9,1,3,1 April 2020
Iron Man," Start of infinity saga!
","As K Fiege said, it was the best option to start the marvel universe.

Green Book," Pure Drama! Life in 2 months
","Its about changing the world. How we are biased to people by color. How we assume something and make their image accordingly which makes things complex. The problems and issues we have in the society in a broader way. You have to be the change to see the change. We can get along with the person we think we couldnt by interacting and learning about them. The life in itself over the two months. How we grow when we spend time with virtuos people. The company we keep polishes us to be better people. Money and throne is nothing compared to love and family.
