Requiem for a Dream," The strongest anti-drug message you could wish for.
","Before watching this film, I had only heard about Requiem as being a film that should have been Oscar nominated. Having seen it, I strongly agree with this notion.Spoilers.Aronofsky gives us a very graphic look at the lives of drug users in New York. Jared Leto is great as Harry, a drug user who becomes a dealer, who becomes a junkie with horrific consequences. Watching him fall lower and lower is truly hard to do, as it is to watch what happens to his girlfriend Marion, played wonderfully by Jennifer Connelly. However, the show is stolen by Ellen Burstyn as Harry's mother who unwittingly gets hooked on what she thinks are diet pills, and falls apart before our eyes, while constantly being taunted by her fridge. I would say that the scene where her TV show characters come out of the TV is the most moving scene in the film.
I actually watched this film with my (very mature for her age) 14 year old sister, unaware of how graphic it would be. I am happy to say that if there was any chance of her taking drugs before, there isn't now. She does want her friends to see it... I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing yet!Aronofsky should be very proud of what he has produced. This film is a true work of art, and sends out the strongest message possible. Well done to him for having the balls to make something like this.On a side note, I also appreciate my arms more than ever...",Null,0,1,24 April 2004
The Girl Next Door," A lot better than I thought it would be.
","OK, I'll be the firs to to admit. There's only one reason I went to see this film - her name is Elisha Cuthbert. I know, I'm shallow, but I just felt like going to see her looking good for about 2 hours. Is that a crime? The only crime here is that this film has been judged according to the main actress, when to my surprise, this was actually a very entertaining, funny and heartwarming film.I expected the usual fare that has been seen oh-so-many times before. Yes, you can guess what happens in terms of the romance, (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again) but there was just more to this film than the others I have seen from the same genre. (You would have to class this as teenage romantic comedy I'm afraid.) Elisha is very good as an ex-porn star trying to lead a normal life, and Emile Hirsch is a very good choice as Matt, the intelligent student guy who wants to be cool, but for me the best performances are by Matt's two best friends, Eli and Klits. (with a K!) Eli had me in stitches a few times.Also, the film's music was excellent. Look out for the soundtrack, should be a very worthwhile purchase.Overall, a very entertaining film that is well worth seeing.
