Ghost," Whoopi Was Great! - Premise was not
","Whoopi Goldberg was a hoot in this picture. I think she is the highlight.The main point of the story was not that the good guy became a ghost and pined for his live girlfriend, but that the bad guy was trying to find and steal the good guy's computer password. What did he expect to find in Patrick Swayze's wallet, a piece of paper that said 'My password is....?' Pretty silly.",Null,0,1,12 February 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Broadway Sequence Doesn't Fit
","The Broadway dance sequence is quite phenomenal, but I always thought it was inconsistent with the rest of the movie.  It's pretty impressive for a 1952 musical, but not the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a 20s era studio's first talkie.  The movie (Singin' in the Rain) is about the making of a talkie about a dancing cavalier, but this modern sequence suddenly pops up unexpectedly.  And where's Lina Lamont who's supposed to be the star of the movie?The Broadway sequence is a joy to behold, but it really doesn't fit.",9,3,6,23 April 1999
