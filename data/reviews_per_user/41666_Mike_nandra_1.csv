Skyfall," I fell ill after I watched Skyfall
","The above is the truth, after watching a late showing of Skyfall, I spent the rest of the night in bed cocooned in my feverish delirium trying to figure out what I had seen. The first 45 mins was quite entertaining, with some top-notch action pieces and banter. But once we left for Silva's island, the whole thing collapsed into boredom. It felt like a BBC production of say 'Spooks' or even the recent 'Hunted'. As if they lost interest and budget. I have read reviews of how it is the best bond film ever, best bond villain, best bond, etc. But despite the action the plot as mentioned in other reviews is about hard drive misplaced with agents names (ala Mission Impossible). And this is forgotten about half way thru the film. So the film turns into a revenge and M's swan song piece. Why did the film forget the main aspects of a Bond film that need to be in there i.e: A villain who is threat to the world in some way. Bond given mission by M. Bond has to deal with his henchmen/women who have their unique way of disposing people. Bond will bed an accomplice and/or henchwoman to get to said villain. Bond gets caught in an inescapable trap, but lucky for him him his Q's gadgets. Bond confront and kills his nemesis in his lair and just about escapes with leading lady. James Bond will return. This has been the simple building blocks of every bond film; what has made it different is the choice of villain/henchmen, the leading ladies, the locations, the explosions and gadgets.Casion Royale and Quantum of Solace kept things fresh by using the revenge arc. They could have built on Silva's revenge and continued it throughout this film. For he is not that different to Bond or where you can see Bond end up after a few too many shaken martini's, more non-meaningful relationships, more suffering from his injuries and pains and basically M deciding he is of no use anymore. And Bond actually realising this, seeing Silva as forgotten broken comrade, a lost brother. And when has M ever concerned him/herself with Bond? His/her interest lied it getting the mission completed so he or she would not get the heat for it.Thats where one of the main problems lies with Skyfall. Its dedicated to M (Bond's Mother figure) where we know she does not give a crap about Bond. And the viewer knows this and its somewhat unconvincing, boring of a sub plot. Another is Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva. Someone mentioned he looks like David Walliams in a wig. I have to agree but David Walliam in a blonde wig ala Dinner with the Schmucks was far more funnier then Javier here. Im not saying Javier is not a brilliant actor, but making him camp, giving him too much to say took the menace out of his villainy. He had far more presence as the almost mute in No Country For Old men.In fact the whole film is back to front. Below is having seen the whole piece is my view on how the set pieces should have flowed: Spoiler Alert: Opening Bond barrel (its the 3rd film we are missing it at start still) M head towards MI6 headquarters, it blows up, news informing us of various agents being killed.M flees to Skyfall. Bond comes out of the shadows as been in recluse since QOS. Skyfall battle happens with Ronson taking charge, Silva in the shadows kills M 'Bye Mommie'. M dies in Bond's arms Skyfall burns, Brick with skyfall name lands in lake turns into animation - opening titles start - titles show animation of Bond silhouette over M's tombstone. Titles end.Opening scene at Turkey, whole sequence takes place, Tanner in make shift MI6 giving feedback to Bond and Eva. But its now Bond telling Eva to take the shot. She takes the shot.Next shot Bond survives and put through his paces for recovery/training. Is he mentally still there? He has a meeting with Mallory and being told he lost the hard drive and the various agents are being killed. He is given all clear to pursue the mission.Meeting with Q (Q explains he managed to construct a small version of the hand scan gun from Licence to Kill and homing device from Goldfinger from left over's at blown MI6 branch.Spends cat and mouse chasing Ronson and Silva across globe. Shanghai sequence with Severine happens. She leads him to Ronson. Sequence in Skyscraper happens with Ronson's death. Bond gets knocked out unconscious by same shadowy figure (Silva). We see Bond being tortured by Silva. Silva explains his pain and reasoning. We see Bond almost falling for it but escapes. Homing device activated - Silva is captured.We have the MI6 sequence where Silva escapes, brings London to its knees. Flees to his island. Severine almost left for dead. Bond and her team up and head for his lair.Big action sequence on island, Blows up.Mallory and Moneypenny get introduced to Bond.Bond beds Severine with a closing innuendo remark.James Bond Will Return",3,11,22,14 November 2012
