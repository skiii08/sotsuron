Ford v Ferrari," Finally a good movie
",This is by far the best movie of 2019. A movie worth going to see on the big screen. Great acting!!!,8,0,1,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Title of the movie is misleading
",Don't believe all the bad reviews. Not the best star wars movie but definitely worth seeing. There is no way possible that all these new Star Wars movies could top the first three made. People are going in to these movies with very high expectations that's why you're seeing bad reviews.,7,1,5,20 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Good movie
",Good solid 8 star movie. Worth going to see it at the big screen.,8,1,3,20 September 2019
Joker," Definitely not a 10
",This was a good movie but definitely not a 10. I could laugh through the whole movie and not have many lines and look good too. Definitely not Oscar worthy for any actor but great movie plot. Wait for Netflix,1,22,77,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Way to long of a movie
",Couldn't wait for it to end. Movies shouldn't be this long. Wait for it to get to Netflix,5,0,2,20 September 2019
