Lucky Number Slevin," Nothing worth caring about
","One of the most important things in a film is its characters. However, it is often the case that these characters are all boring, or generally dislike-able, which makes it difficult at least for me to get into it. This problem can be ignored if there is a strong story, or at least poignant and interesting dialogue thrown in to give a level of respect to the character. The paramount example of this would be Pulp Fiction. This film has NOTHING of the sort I just mentioned.Another redeeming factor in a crime/caper flick can be exciting action sequences... again this film doesn't have any. Furthermore, the star power this movie had going into it is painfully unused. Freeman and Kingsley are a waste, and Willis does nothing to help. Hartnett is as annoying as ever, but I will say Lucy Liu was cool in it - maybe because she had the only likable character.My guess would be this film was misdirected, because it does have a good story... it's just not paced and revealed correctly. There is a good plot twist, but it's timing is in a flashback and at a point in watching it where there there is just nothing to care about; If the film stopped trying to be a Tarantino and just told the events in chronological order, like movies used to be, it would have been good.",5,2,6,7 February 2007
The Big Lebowski," This...this is not a worthy adversary...
","This is a film that is hard to describe. When anyone asks what it's about, I just say, 'The Dude'.The plot is simple, but well-written. The characters are great, and the dialogue is really nothing short of perfect. This is coupled with star talent used to its fullest potential. There is no one else who could be The Dude, Jeff Bridges just is. John Goodman is hilarious as the short-fused Vietnam vet Walter, and Steve Buscemi plays a different role than usual, but he still is given great moments because the three main characters play off each other so well. The script is endlessly quotable.Now this is not to say that the dialogue and characters alone make the movie funny. Comedy bleeds through at almost every scene in the unusual locations and series of events that occur. Maybe the funniest scene ever in a movie to me occurs when The Dude gets his car back and good old CCR comes on the radio playing 'Lookin' Out My Back Door,' and Dude pounds on the roof, drinkin' a beer and smokin' a jane all at the same time, and he of course ends up crashing into a dumpster. Total Classic.But maybe one thing that I find so great about this comedy is that even though I've seen it five or six times in the past couple years, I always see something or get something new, every time. And everyone should dig the idea that The Dude really is someone we all could learn from. I mean, he really just doesn't care about the views of him from society. He just lives as he wants, and he doesn't hurt anyone.Now I'm not saying he's a hero, because what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man, and I'm talking' about The Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, who, well, he's the man of his time and place. He just fits right in there.",10,0,1,12 February 2007
Resident Evil," Wait... This might be Chris' blood....
","I don't know if any other movie infuriates me more than this. Well, maybe the sequel. The people in charge in Hollywood don't seem to realize that videogames turned to film have so much more potential than given credit for. That's why films like this don't have a large budget, which leads to idiots like Paul W.S. Anderson getting the chance to direct and write... neither of which can he do.I mean honestly, the Resident Evil video game series does not have an amazing story like some will say. What it does have is many characters that will one day go down as classic heroes and villains, with a conspiracy plot that was original and highly entertaining in how it was uncovered. The was all set in the perfect atmosphere - a creepy mansion filled with bloodthirsty zombies... awesome! That would be a good movie and it is already a great series of games.The only thing this movie has in common with that is... yes, there are zombies, but they're not scary. They look like sick, hungover mental patients who can't do anything. I heard someone once say this movie was the poor man's Aliens. Exactly. Everything about it is just so routine and mediocre, and aside from that the best characters are killed right away and in awful ways. (The laser hallway is among the dumbest things ever conceived by mankind.) Furthermore, the atmosphere of the games is lost in misplaced maniacal techno music...why?? I'm not saying that the movie is bad just because it does not follow the games, because the setting as a prequel is acceptable. However, there are several other things that make a film enjoyable, and it just doesn't work here. No good acting leads to lack of chemistry amongst the characters. The pacing is poor, the dialogue is mundane, and it is not scary enough for the horror flick it aspires to be. The director was just lost. Rather than use a great premise, Paul Anderson abandoned it and made something of his own, which isn't any good on its own. I'll never know why they didn't let George Romero make it. And of course, since it was low budget - the film made a profit and they made a sequel. That is why this sad cycle will continue to repeat itself, and the video game movie will forever be wasted.",4,0,1,8 February 2007
Batman Begins," Good movie, but not the savior of comics turned to film
","Batman Begins (2005) is the return of the dark knight to the big screen for the first time since the abysmal Batman and Robin (1997). Unquestionably, it is a very well made film. For Batman films, it contains the best story, arguably the best supporting cast, and generally good direction and pacing. All the pieces are in place, but the execution of these assets falls a little short. The film builds itself up, but in the end, does not entertain as well as it could have.First of all, Christian Bale is Batman and Bruce Wayne. He does a good job overall. This film gives him the most screen time as Wayne and in my opinion he does well at portraying the troubled younger man following the death of his parents. What follows was meant to be a steady evolution into darker mental anguish and self-discovery and as we all know culminates into his ultimate decision to become Batman. Somewhere along the line, however, his acting and his character simply no longer develop, yet the story does quite well. He stops the change in character too early and he remains static for the rest of the film. Though that final character type is good enough to be Batman, it feels forced when we hear him yelling at one of his victims for the first time, shouting at the top of his lungs and in a cheap imitation of raspiness. It's hard to describe I guess, but then so is the disjointed nature of Batman.The origin story of Batman in this film very interesting here, however. Being trained in the ninja arts is appropriate, and it is well-supported by the mentor in Liam Neeson. I am not a reader of the comics, so I know little of his true origins, but for film purposes, it was very well done.As for the rest of the supporting cast, Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, and he adds good comic relief and humanity to what is missing from Batman. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, but why complain when he's got the greatest voice ever? He even gets in some good one-liners. Gary Oldman was good in his role as Sergeant, and then Lieutenant Gordon. The only duds in the cast come through Cilian Murphy as a pretty boring villain and Katie Holmes is useless, though they both try... They really just don't get enough screen time, and Holmes could've shown some skin.So the parts are in place. How does it turn out? It's my opinion, but I just never felt any... excitement when I watched it. It was all methodical and professional to be sure, but it just didn't do anything to step forward and entertain. It plays it safe. Even the soundtrack is subdued and at times unrepresentative of what I was hoping for, but true to what I got. The action sequences, for instance, are edited rapidly, and you never see two characters, on screen at the same time, even for the giving and receiving end of a single punch or kick. Why? This makes it almost impossible to get a real confrontation to help cheer Batman on.In summary, it's good film and good revival of the series, but it leaves a little to be desired. I expect the Dark Knight to easily top this.",7,0,1,4 June 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Anderson resumes failure
","After the first Resident Evil film, it was inevitable because of the low budget that a sequel was in the works. Whereas the first film was a prequel of sorts to the first game, this one is (I think) a story about Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Again, departing from the story of the games is an interesting choice, but when the source material is just so much better than what Anderson can come up with, you have to ask, why does he continue to do it? He can't write a script, or direct an action scene without stealing from something else - the way he keeps himself original is through terrible editing, I guess.I give Anderson credit for at least putting some characters from the games onto the big screen. These include Jill, Carlos, Nicholai, the Nemesis himself, and a few others. Though of course, these characters are the same in name only, and stray far from what they were and should have been. Jill is now cocky and soulless, who can't take care of herself without the return of Alice, aka superwoman. Carlos does nothing important, and Nicholai, who was such a badass villain in the games, dies pathetically to a single zombie dog. Ugh.Now, onto the Nemesis itself. The monster looked pretty good and I was happy that they kept him mostly as an elaborate costume rather than CGI. In the games, Nemesis was nearly invincible, only dying after sustaining massive damage from a giant RAIL GUN. (SPOILERS -Needless to say, Nemesis doesn't live up to his real strength, and dies in the worst fight sequence I have ever seen. You can guess who it's against.) END OF SPOILERS.The film is badly paced, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and it laughs in the face of all fans of the series. Paul W.S. Anderson resumes his failure, and he will continue to do so. As long as the people in charge at Hollywood fail to realize that a video game turned to film has real potential, other than slightly-better-than B-grade cinema, the video game movie will be forever wasted.",3,1,2,11 February 2007
