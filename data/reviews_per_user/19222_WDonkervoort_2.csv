Blade Runner 2049," Pleasant surprise
",This movie was a pleasant surprise. Sure: I love myself a good Denis Villeneuve movie but I never thought that the original needed a sequel and here it is.I am a sucker for cyberpunk but this movie went all in. So where to start here? The visuals were great! The color palette used topped by the stunning cinematography made it a feast for the eyes.The music was a great throwback to the old Vangelis soundtrack of the first movie.Ryan Gosling always works for me and as far as I am concerned he delivers in this movie. It's also great to see some familiar faces.,8,2,9,22 January 2020
Apocalypse Now," The Horror
","The movie is about a trip that is made by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a boat that is under the command of Chief Phillips (Albert Hall). They are heading to Cambodia to kill a renegade colonel who's raining down terror in the area. (A nice detail: Laurence Fishburne plays Mister Clean, one of the crewmen on board the vessel.) The world seems to get more unreal with every moment they come closer to their targetSimply the best movie ever made. A surrealistic trip on the rivers of Vietnam leading all the way into Cambodia. With some outstanding performances of Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper and of course Marlon Brando in a breathtaking role. It could be said that his performance as renegade colonel who's leading a group of natives deep in the jungles, is almost as brilliant as his Don Vito Corleone performance in another Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece: The Godfather. This movie also contains one of the greatest war scenes ever fabricated. The attack on a village under the music of Wagner is just brilliant. There are so many things I would like to say about this move but in the end you should go look for your self. In my opinion there isn't any other movie that even comes close to this movie.The Horror The Horror",10,0,1,1 December 2004
