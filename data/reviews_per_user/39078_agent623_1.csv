Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This is more like it!
","Kill Bill: Volume 2 was a major step forward from Volume I.  Those who liked Vol I purely for the gore-fest will be a little disappointed, but if you like QT's other movies you will be in for a treat. Vol 2 relies a bit more on Tarantino-esque dialog (which I like) so be forewarned, if you find it annoying from his other movies you will probably be a tad bored in some parts. If you love witty dialog and a good healthy dose of revenge you could not ask for anything more.  Anyway, what are you waiting for?  Go see it!",9,1,2,16 April 2004
