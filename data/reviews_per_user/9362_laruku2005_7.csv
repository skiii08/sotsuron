The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Weak acting and not smooth
","I am truly disappointed with this movie when i saw at cinema. It feels so different with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Perhaps i put my expectation too high when i saw this movie. I love Catching Fire and i do not like this movie. Really. I do not read the book, but i love the Hunger Games and THG: Catching Fire a lot.Jennifer Lawrence shows something difficult to act as Katniss here.Josh Hutcherson is too looks unsure to be Katniss' lover.I want to watch the Part II, so please.. Please do not mess with the Part II. Fix it. Thank you2/10",2,2,4,25 August 2015
The Maze Runner," Runner in a maze is an amazing idea!
","The Maze Runner is very entertaining. You will realize that almost all casts are young man. But the shows an acting quality so good.I don't even care either Minho is handsome or not as long as he can show the good acting in line with the story board and blend with another chars.The film is post apocalyptic story drawing..with somehow untrust issues in it.At glance this movie have similar taste with the Hunger Games or Divergence. Honestly I should say this movie is significantly better than Divergence, even can not surpass the Hunger Games though.There was no sex scene or drugs on this movie.I am not a book reader and I can say still this movie is good. Have a good plot. Really great!! Recommended! Score:7.5/10",7,0,2,29 September 2014
Oblivion," Oblige-vion
","I do love sci-fi movies i.e: Star Trek, Star Wars and more. But i can't enjoyed this movie. It was too long.The storyline is great, the concept is awesome, I do love the costume and the concept of the New World which marked with white color.Olga's played very well..her natural act caught my heart. Wish i can see her at another movie. Tom Cruise act as Jack Harper (Why i feels like saw a Jack Reacher or something..hahaha..), his charisma astounding..Act good and shown emotion as well.The dislike of this movie: the rhythm of story that was too slow. The drone is too simple.. i imagine there would be a bigger enemies than the drone. Too many questions running in my head while watched this. I didn't read the novel or heard any story of this movie. I just did not understand who create tet and why it needs human to fix drone? why only Jack and Victoria copied though.Honestly, maybe the story was too high for me..so i couldn't imagine higher. So if you like a sci-fi movie, please see this movie. I am dully recommend it.Regards,",6,1,2,10 July 2014
Django Unchained," Django : a Superb Quentin
","This movie is kind of a realistic - ego of a man who wants a freedom. A slave turns to be a master and kill the bad guys.I just love the way Quentin direct the way of this movie, Dr. Schultz played very-very-very well by the talented Christoph Waltz. I think Dr Schultz really act better the Django (Foxx) itself.Mr. Candie is also played very well and scary enough on a depressed dealing situation of justice. However, DiCaprio is succeed to steal every scene when he shown.Kerry Washington also played so tough and looks solid enough as Bromhilda.I think Director of photography of this movie is a genius one, every scenes looks very strong and beautiful. Salute! Different from the ordinary film.I'm never had a chance to watch the old version, so for me this is a masterpiece! Rate 9/10",9,0,3,26 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Star lord, wicked raccoon and a walking tree
","Guardian Of Galaxy is a kind of superhero movie not in a common things. I am never read any comics of them before, i am not a Marvel or DC fans. But I have to say that this movie is Outstanding.I would say Avengers is sucks and not that good, but this is awesome. a balance package between, drama, action, humor and space adventure. My fave char is Rocket and Groot, a pair of kick-ass uncommon bounty hunter. Mr. Cooper cast the voice very well.One more thing, the old songs from this movie are TOTALLY COOL. I like the title scene when the Star Lord dancing with the songs played through his walkman. Karen Gillian played very well as Nebula, i like her too. =)Recommend to watch. Rated 13+verdict:9/10",9,2,7,21 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Brilliant..Benedict is an awesome
",I do not expect this movie will be that good when i saw the trailer of the movie.Surprisingly the movie play very smooth with Ben shows his very good act as the strong character as Alan Turing. I should say this movie was very nice with actors and actresses blended one each other.Keira also beautiful and not show a slow pace acting.The jokes was very smart and successful makes me laugh.This movie is very entertaining and smart.Have a strong feels like 'Rush'. Superb.I love it.10/10,10,2,6,25 August 2015
Lucy," New kind of movie by Luc Besson
","Lucy..' Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it? ' Lucy was a kind of movie to answer those question. and Lucy did it! Lucy showed a beautiful shot with some issue of human brain capacity.Scarlett Jo played great as she is, even act not in her best performance..maybe because shes in pregnant while shooting this movie.Once again..Morgan Freeman steals attention in many scenes on this movie. I love that.And after all..if you like a sci-fi-action packed movie, you'll love this movie.Entertaining! (7/10)",7,5,13,4 September 2014
