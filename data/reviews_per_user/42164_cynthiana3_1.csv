Sucker Punch," It could have been a powerful movie ...
","instead of Lisbeth Salander, Americans get Babydoll. There is no sweet revenge, just self-annihilation. I would not recommend this to anyone who is, or knows, a woman, or anyone else for that matter, who has been physically abused. The idea that a young woman's revenge fantasy is to wear short skirts and heels to destroy the fictional/imagined/dreamt 'bad men' is baffling. This is a movie - the script could take the audience in any number of directions, but to end the movie with the victim accepting/welcoming a lobotomy is so disturbing. Why didn't the script writers have the girls go after the men/people who put them in the asylum in the first place? I was so disappointed - it could have been such a good movie.",1,7,15,11 April 2011
