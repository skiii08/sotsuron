Blade Runner 2049," almost fell asleep in the theater, three times.
","I almost fell asleep in the theater, three times. The only thing that kept me awake was the awful music, which pretended that something compelling was happening. The tedium lasted for two hours, with boring dialogues, single dimension characters, unnecessary nudity. I would give it 1 star if it were not for the last twenty minutes. It did give me a surprise when it turned out that K was not real human. The cinematography was beautiful, which Denis is really good at, just like he did in Arrival. Other than that, I really cannot understand why both have a 8+ IMDb score.",5,14,30,7 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," nothing other than entertaining
","If you would like to spend 2.5 hours only for a few laughs, go for it. It's nothing other than entertaining. I really cannot understand why Watchmen have a IMDb score of 7.6 which is way deeper than this and way more worthy, while this one gets a higher score 8.2. The story itself is very dull.",5,5,12,11 November 2017
Justice League," yet another fast food
",This is yet another fast food movie. You'll feel good but no nutrition there. There are so many characters that the director wants to demonstrate. It's bewildering as each gets a slice of time and with relatively independent stories.The whole story is not convincing because superman alone can defeat the big boss which makes the rest of the story unnecessary.,5,4,8,19 November 2017
Dunkirk," Great writing. Great directing
","A good movie tells you something you don't know and inspires you to think in a different way. This movie is absolutely a good one. It reveals the other side of wars. I am impressed by how Christopher Nolan once again present us so many characters while each so differently and so vividly . Patriots sail spontaneously to rescue trapped soldiers; desperate soldiers live like animals and their only goal is to live even at the cost of deaths of their buddies; pilots have sense of honor and duty, fighting till the last drop of fuel. That's all human nature. Everyone can be any of them given the same experience. Remember how proud one was chosen to be pilot those days and how good education and training they took, and you won't be surprised how they fought in the war. If you live at a time that your hometown will be taken by enemies at any time, you will also do whatever you can to win the war without a hesitate. And if every day is flooded with death and despair, warriors can degenerate and turn into walking dead.Great writing. Great directing. This is yet another masterpiece of Christopher Nolan.",9,0,5,26 September 2017
Coco," Gracias Pixar
","My wife was not a fan of cartoon which she thought is too na√Øve for an adult. 
This movie changed her mind.
She cried in the theater and so did half of the audiences. 
It's great movie, promoting family bonds, fighting for dreams, and Mexican traditions. 
I am not Hispanic but I am a conservative guy who admire and respect traditions. 
Pixar is really good at storytelling. There was not even a single second that I was thinking something else but indulged all the time. 
The pictures are beautiful. 
The story is compelling with a few nice surprises.
The ending is flawless.",9,0,2,18 December 2017
American Made," Never trust the government
",Never trust the government. He rose. He fell. He rose again. He was killed. All thanks to the government. This movie tells us once again that never trust the government. Politician were and are really good at telling lies. Never let them pull your strings. The recent Obama care is yet another great example. Ridiculous story but true during that cold war. Not impressive but entertaining.,6,1,4,29 September 2017
