The Ring," Good horror
","Unlike any other horror I've seen. Seen it first time in front row of cinema. More disturbing than scary (especially the tape). You need to think pretty hard when watching this film (well I did!) The second time I watched it, I noticed weird things that I didn't notice the first time I seen it. Even though I didn't think it was very frightening....I still worried at night that a girl with long hair over her face would walk into my room, or my TV at the end of my bed might just happen to switch on, or the phone might ring. It wasn't till all that I just mentioned ran through my mind, I then began to think....'well, maybe that film was a bit scary!'. Not one to miss though.",Null,1,2,25 August 2004
