The Blair Witch Project," Overhype didn't hurt it
","I saw this on a double bill with SIXTH SENSE at the drive-in, and based on user comments, I thought I would hate this one and like SIXTH SENSE. But the opposite is true. It's not the scariest movie ever, but it is creepy and is a testament to today's Hollywood mentality that you don't need ARMAGEDDON-sized budgets to make a good hit film. The independent film community should be proud of this accomplishment. the tension that develops is realistically portrayed, but the ending doesn't hit as hard as I thought it would. Fans of this film should go rent 84 CHARLIE MOPIC, a mock Vietnam documentary done in very much the same style as this.",7,1,2,19 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas' heart wasn't in this one
","Okay, there are two kinds of people. There are those who consider the STAR WARS saga to be one of the eight wonders of the world, then there are those like myself who enjoyed the trilogy, but have don't see the need to watch over and over and over.... I can only give the latter category a marginal recommendation on this. Sure, all the technical elements are there for special effects, but there's less of a good story in this one. The origin story of this whole new trilogy is only going to appeal to the fanatics. The fact that Lucas held off on this one because he wanted to wait for advanced computer effects tells me where his heart is. This film is more upbeat than THE MATRIX, but both films comment on today's society that is so impersonal and only wants to provide you with the best technology can offer as a way to avoid personal interaction. While MATRIX conveys this message within the film, MENACE conveys this message in the sense that there are no strong characters with traits you remember after it's over. You only remember some of the neat imagery. In summary, I'm in no hurry to see episode 2.",4,0,1,27 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oh my God!
",I could not finish this movie! I turned it off after 70 minutes and I have NEVER given up on any movie no matter how excruciating it was (and I watch a LOT of movies). But I could not comprehend me sitting through 2 more hours of this. It's no surprise I didn't like it since I couldn't finish reading the book in high school either ( and it was for a class.) I now know I couldn't be a professional film critic because it would mean having to sit through the next two installments.,Null,0,0,28 November 2002
Saving Private Ryan," *** stars
","The beginning and ending of this film are very vivid, but the middle slows down to a point where it loses its intensity, and therefore can't be ranked among the best war films. The best ones remain intense ALL the way through. The film does stand out for not being as patriotic as all other WWII films; it actually shows the 'War is hell' side that we only really see in Vietnam War films.  But it p****s me off Spielberg can show hanging intestines, severed limbs and other atrocities that all other film makers (especially horror film makers) are given NC-17s for. Yet Mr. Infallible can get away with it because he's making a 'meaningful' film.",6,1,2,19 May 1999
There's Something About Mary," * star
","By the time I saw this, I had heard about all the allegedly funny scenes, and they're not even funny to start with. The Farelly Brothers movies are getting progressively worse. I wouldn't have considered this material funny as a teenager. And I'm no conservative either (I've seen Andrew Dice Clay in concert). It's unfair to call it 'this generation's ANIMAL HOUSE.' At least that film broke some new ground; MARY has much of the humor that critics who praised this film hated in films such as PORKY'S. When bad taste goes mainstream like this, it has no shock value anymore, it becomes just plain lousy like most of the sitcoms that pollute our airwaves.",1,6,12,20 May 1999
Pulp Fiction," worst movie ever
","After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably.",1,43,100,20 May 1999
Die Hard," Influential but flawed
","Some people talk about this film as if it's one of the all time best. It's certainly been very influential, but let's not overlook some of the flaws. Too much time is spent on stupid supporting characters who don't believe what's going on. It detracts from what should be a breathless pace. Keeping all the action in one locale is kind of boring. I liked the sequel better because the action shifted around a lot. Hans is a villain in the Bond tradition, but the fact that he goes through this much trouble just for some money wasn't very convincing to me, nor did it make him despisable enough. STILL, I do like this film, but I just prefer action heroes who are larger than life. Three dimensional action heroes tend to come across as unbelievable to me.",7,1,3,21 May 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Good, but hardly a classic
","calling this the scariest movie ever made or one of the best is a bit much. What it is is a suspenseful, well acted thriller with a villain who is physically as well as verbally aggressive (kind of a rarity). It's also noteworthy for giving us a tough, but still vulnerable heroine (also a rarity). But I don't understand why people applaud his escape at the end; to me it's just as much of a cheat as so many horror movies where the killer is seen in the last frames. I also don't think Lecter is as scary as Scorpio in DIRTY HARRY or THE HITCHER's John Ryder. But as a horror fan, I was glad to see a lot of respect paid by the Academy to this.",7,0,3,13 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," worst film of the year
","Here's a homework assignment for everyone who has hyperventilated with hyperbole over this film and praised its ending. Go read Ambrose Bierce's short story, OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE, and then rent Adrian Lyne's JACOB'S LADDER. And if neither of them surprised or shocked you, then you will know how I felt after watching this trash. There is nothing scary, enlightening or moving about this film. It's a sugar-coated, sappy film with no edge at all, and strictly for fans of GHOST. The so-called twist does not redeem it at all and there is just nothing good I can say about SIXTH SENSE.",7,0,0,26 August 1999
The Matrix," *1/2 stars
","I generally don't like sci-fi movies about computers and/or VR. There are always exceptions, but unfortunately there's nothing exceptional about this film. The villains are bland and non-intimidating, Keanu Reeves is a terrible lead and the matrix itself along with the characters inside of it just aren't interesting. the influence of Hong Kong cinema as well as MORTAL KOMBAT is evident in the action scenes. I still look forward to future offerings from the Wachowski Brothers because I liked ASSASSINS and BOUND, but I doubt I would watch any sequels to this.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
