The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," seriously epic and bleak like EMPIRE STRIKES BACK
","Time will tell on this one, I dug it muchly. It had KATNISS with the rebellion, trying again to grow and be strong for those she loves and the love of freedom. It's way more sci fi and (stars wars) than the other more (gladiator) type films. I don't want to spoil though most have read the books, MOST of the haters on here are book purists (good) but they seemingly lack the insight of the apples and oranges difference between books and films. did the choices suit the making of a heavy kick butt epic sci fi film, I believe so. it's heavy AND it made me think, and I want to see it again. seeing it with fans at a sold out showing was perfect, the crowd cheered all the RAD cameo's and made mockingjay signs with the rebels. lots of politics guerilla warefare n tears in this film. it doesn't let up that the fascists are very powerful it will not be an easy win. Whatev to the haters this one delivers SCI FI GOLD!",8,11,38,22 November 2014
