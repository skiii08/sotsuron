Walk the Line," Plot drags a bit, but still an excellent portrayal of a genuine legend
","Joaquin Phoenix, as weird as he is, managed an outstanding portrayal of Johnny Cash in this movie. Bravo! Reese Witherspoon also deserves credit for her portrayal of June Carter. I have listened to and admired the music of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash my whole life, and found this movie to accurately reflect my impression of 'their' story. I do not know if the events and timelines depicted in the movie are consistent with the actual facts in their lives, but I was singularly impressed with the performances of both of these actors. In general I do not like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor, and I have never seen a single movie of Reese Witherspoon's. I have seen other movies about singers, and often the attempt to portray their music fails miserably, and detracts from the movie itself. Walk the Line manages quite the opposite, there is plenty of music from the 'Man in Black', and it is perfectly aligned to help the story. You find out why he's '...headed down to San Antone...', and just who is in '...the burning ring of fire...'. If you are a Johnny Cash fan, this is a MUST SEE - at least once. If you have only recently heard some of Johnny's music, I highly recommend this movie so you can find out about this genuine American legend. If you've never heard of Johnny Cash, what planet did you come from?",10,1,3,3 December 2005
