Mission: Impossible III," Boring, predictable from beginning to end
","I'm very surprise that so many people actually liked the movie because the storyline and plot were completely predictable from beginning to end. Especially if you are somebody who watched Alias regularly, I'm pretty sure you would be watching the movie and mentally telling yourself ' I bet they are going to do this next', and then feel the extreme disappointment that the next scene did not prove your predictions wrong.It is very disappointing and boring, and lots of corny clich√© scenes.The mission does seem very impossible, but I felt it was not pulled off in a way where I feel completely impressed on how it was pulled off.Over all, it was real torture watching it. No fun in watching a new movie when you keep knowing what's going to happen next.",3,8,18,6 May 2006
