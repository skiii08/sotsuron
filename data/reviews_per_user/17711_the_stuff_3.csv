Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I want my money back!!!
","I paid $10 on opening night at 1.00am to watch a piece of total garbage! Yes, that's right, garbage!!! I mean, the movie begins with characters we don't even know, letting jedis on their ship. But the discussions of both are hard to understand as the casual viewer such as myself ask ourselves what is happening.If you compare Episode I to Epsiode IV, you can see that in IV, the good-guys are being taken over by a dark lord for a reason, and thus right away you understand that Darth Vader is eveil, while C3-PO and R2-D2 are good. then the plot develops with Luke, and the sunsequent ending is clear after character development is accomplished. In Episode I, nothing even close to this takes place, except seeing Anakin as a kid race with Pods. The overall plot here is a tax dispute??? Come on, something better George, please!The final action sequences were amazing, but even the death of one of them (I won't specify which) is extremely far-fetched and ridiculous. Also, even with this great action, the underlying plot leading to this point isn't as strong as others, resulting in the audience caring less about the outcome, since we don't really care for the characters and their causes. Despite all this, the graphics are amazing, and at times left me in speecheless amazement.However, seeing another battle sequence with NO human characters is not right for me in a Star Wars flick. I guess to me, STAR WARS should be self-explanitory, and not a puzzle that you the viewer needs to put together in a hurry in order to see the whole picture. My friends, who totally understood everything, had to explain things to me. However, the only reason they knew ahead of time, was because they read various books, and information ahead of time, which is not right, since one shouldn't have to do that in order to gain a true understanding of a movie. Lucas has a lot of work to do if he wants the next one to be up to par with the rest of the series.OVERALL - a low 5/10",Null,0,1,1 November 1999
The Mummy," AWESOME!!!!
","I almost killed my friend when he said that he didn't want to watch the Mummy! He thought it would be childish, and stupid, and basically called me the same for liking it. Foolish person, he was, as after he saw it, he regretted not watching it in the theatre. This movie, which I saw 4 times in the theatres, was an action-packed, full-of-fun, bundle of joy. Brendan Fraser was an excellent cast for this role, and the sequences of action were incredible. I don't want to give too much away, but the final fighting scenes were better than the entire Return of the Jedi combined!!!! I strongly recommend this movie. Now, so too does my friend.",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
Back to the Future," One of the greatest!
","This is probably one the greatest movies I have ever seen! I mean, I LOVE time travel, and just the thought of someone doing it is enough for me to watch a movie. But the manner in which this movie did it in was AMAZING!Going back to the 1950's, altering the past, attempting to fix it and telling the Doc his future were all integral parts to the entire foundation of the movie. This is definitely a winner! There is a lot of magic in this fast-paced fantasy. I strongly recommend this modern-day classic if you have not yet seen it. If you have, it's always a top-choice when renting movies.10/10, no doubt.",Null,0,1,1 November 1999
