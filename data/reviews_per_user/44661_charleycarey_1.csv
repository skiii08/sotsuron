","I personally thought this was a very good movie. intriguing concept for the plot. I liked how the a lot of the things we saw at the beginning came back to mean something at the end, even the small things. Denzel is always great. New Orleans was a great place for it to take place. I liked how they did show the devastation there. They didn't just film there and ignore what happened. The city became a character. I do think they could have done more with Cavaziel's character. he was great but didn't get as much of a chance to shine. I don't recall seeing the female lead in anything else before but she was good. Tony Scott once again did a great job directing. i think he has a great original style that comes out in all of his movies. Definitely one of the better Denzel movies in my opinion.",7,2,5,23 November 2006
