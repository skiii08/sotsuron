Hereditary," Exquisite horror with a plot that actually pays it all off
","Commanding acting comes together smart, confident writing to create this visceral sense of fear and tension - no filler, I loved the whole thing end to end. Without giving away any spoilers, the ending ties it all together in a way that's so gratifying and unnerving in its historical accuracy. Horror fans will love this film, and real occultists will find it deeply rewarding.",10,1,5,19 October 2019
Wind River," Poor dialogue constrained great actors and beautiful cinematography
","This film really tries hard to give you the feels but truly terrible dialogue gives its talented cast nowhere to go in most of the scenes. Even an actor as fine as Jeremy Renner gets bogged down trying to wade through this insufferable writing, having to resort to an excessive amount of jaw clenching and grizzled, yet wistful, staring at the horizon. It's OK Jeremy! We know it's not your fault, it's not possible to really drop into a scene when your line sounds like something out of a soap opera. Then for good measure on the festival circuit they had to throw in a super realistic rape scene (always prize-worthy!). Whoa! Never seen that before! Except for like every 'lost up its own ass' indie crime movie ever. On the plus side, the portrayal of modern life on a Native reservation was vaguely interesting. I have no idea if it was accurate or fair, but from the outside looking in the characters felt credible, as did the portrayal of the reservation itself. The film is also beautifully located and shot. It's too bad the dialogue and plot were so predictable and silly. Whilst watching this film you'll constantly have the feeling that they might throw in a wendingo, or a shot of a hawk flying while a flute made of reeds plays. Luckily there's no wendingo (spoiler alert! no wendingo!) but the awkward dialogue found many other opportunities to turn what could have been a great little movie into a totally corny rape romp through Alaska, but oh wait it's not Alaska it's Wyoming. Net/net, save your $5.99, there are way better venues to watch Jeremy Renner seethe about intense stuff.",5,6,13,1 December 2017
Mother!," The most thought-provoking piece of cinema I've seen in years
","This is astounding! I can't wait to watch it again, still getting my head around it. I went to see it with one of my best mates who is also an urban shaman and quite drunk at the Century City mall cinema (for LA residents, there's a Gelsons in the basement with a great booze section and they don't do bag checks, it's fantastic). I definitely recommend getting a bit drunk and/or high to see this film. To avoid any spoilers I'm going to go into detail about the film or hypotheses about the deeper meaning of the plot - the joy of this film for me was speculating about the various meanings of the movie, and then getting into a drunk argument with a shaman about it as we tried to find our car for 48 minutes because the signage at that mall is terrible. For me personally, I found it very true to a recurring dream, a common and archetypal dream that I think everyone alive has had at some point. It was as if the film peered straight into the collective unconscious, dredged up some very primal fears and bitch-slapped us with them. I totally understand why many viewers hated this movie but for me personally it was a revelation, I wish I could go back in time and experience it anew all over again.",10,1,4,11 November 2017
