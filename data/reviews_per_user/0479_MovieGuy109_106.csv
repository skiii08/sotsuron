The Blair Witch Project," A very good student film better than most horror
","UCF students Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez directed this fine piece of horror on an ultra low budget and did it better than most every horror film around these days. We never see the antagonists but the suspense is gut-wrenching. The filmmakers seem to be playing on something more significant than petty slasher gore but our imaginations and what we think the attackers are, whether they are supernatural or not. These questions that we come up with add to our own personal sense of fear. The thing that baffles me about this film is how expertly the filmmakers understand the personal responses and fears of the viewer and do not tell us what to think about the villains, but allow us to visualize and expand.",8,1,2,29 October 2011
Angels & Demons," Good, entertaining thriller from Ron Howard
","Angels & Demons-***-See it- Directed by: Ron Howard, Written by: David Koepp, Akiva Goldsman, Dan Brown (Novel), Starring: Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Rance Howard, Gino Conforti.Dan Brown's prequel to his controversial and best selling novel becomes a film as religious symboligist Robert Langdon (Hanks) rushes for the clues to solve a mystery in which a secret society known as The Illuminati has captured four cardinals, killed The Pope, and are threatening to destroy Vatican City with a special anti-matter canister.This film (like its predecessor) is in no way a form of art, nor does it bring up any new questions or thoughts, but what it does work as is pure entertainment and a guilty pleasure that has us until the end. Director Howard kicks up the pace over his slow-moving Da Vinci Code and catches us by surprise. The twists continue to reveal themselves as the story goes on and refuses to take a rest.That is part of what makes it such an thrilling experience is the pace and the twists, plus a lot of great actors such as Hanks, McGregor, Skarsgard, and Mueller Stahl thrown in for good measure. The end result is not masterful, but it sure is captivating.",7,0,0,1 October 2011
Vertigo," Astonishing masterpiece even for Hitchcock
","Alfred Hitchcock has crafted some of the best suspense thrillers of our day. Vertigo is one of these thrillers, a strange, even bizarre film that never ceases to enthrall. You think the movie is going to go one way and it flies completely in the other direction. Hitchcock is one of the few directors that can manage this. Exceptional storytelling with Hitchcock's powerful camera work and a strong opening scene leading the way for a just as exceptional film. The plot twists are some of the best in film history. Even for Hitchcock, this is exceptionally well-crafted. The best part: when James Stewart is doing the private eye work on Kim Novak. There is no dialouge for several minutes, but Bernard Herrmann's score does all the talking.",10,3,6,8 October 2011
The New World," A little boring but astoundingly filmed by Malick
","Malick's fourth film may test your ability to stay awake during quiet pictures but if you keep your eyes open you will be astounded by the beauty of every image of the film. The images have a strong feel for the landscape and the people in the landscape and the most staggering thing about them is the fact that Malick is able to tell his story so well through images alone. This shows just how powerful Malick can be, though here he is not at the top of his form. It has many weak points but the beauty of the picture and Malick's stunning accuracy with his shots is what keeps this film together even when it wants to fall apart before our eyes.",8,1,2,22 November 2011
Requiem for a Dream," It's campy but in a way; effective.
","Requiem for a Dream-**1/2-See it- Directed by: Darren Aronofsky, written by: Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby, Jr., Starring: Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Latcher, Keith David, Sean Gullette.Director Darren Aronofsky teams up with mainstream actors for his newest feature based off the disturbing and jarring novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. The plot covers the story of a New York drug addict (Leto) who finds his world collapsing due to his overuse and perpetual need of drug influence. As he falls into his self-inflicted hell, his elderly mother (very well played by Burstyn) who is obsessed with a television show becomes hooked on prescription diet pills. Connelly plays Leto's girlfriend who gets caught up in the drama of drugs and Wayans plays his dealer who goes into a hell himself.Hallucinatory storytelling with lots of clever dream sequences throughout given the extra boost by a lot of firm acting. Burstyn is incredible in her role and Leto fairs pretty well too. Wayans is not too shabby himself in an uncharacteristic performance in a film that is a change for the comic. Aronofsky is a clever storyteller with firm stylistics and a good eye for hellish fetishes and images. His portrait of contemporary drug addicts is pretty much well-done for all intents and purposes.The question is where did Aronofsky fail? His biggest problem is his insistent use of quick cuts. That is what separates this drug film from Cronenberg's Naked Lunch or Boyle's Trainspotting. He is intent to make this more like an MTV made for television film than anything. If it was not for his talent as a director, it probably would be one of those. This is an addict film made for pop houses, not art houses. That is the weakness of the film as a work of art.If we define films based off clever style, Aronofsky would have made a masterpiece. To the misfortune of the young director, that is not what makes a great film great. The stylistics are the best the crew has to offer, but the actors certainly give it their all. Each actor is in great form and inhabit their roles well. His pop style may be thin as air, but Aronofsky's use of actors is as prevailing as ever. Each actor is used incredibly well and Burstyn is so frighteningly realistic that I have a new image of this old woman. We can use style and we can use great actors, but the writing and the storytelling is still the most important aspect to any film.",8,0,0,23 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing prequel
","After seeing the first prequel of Lucas' new installment of Star Wars films, I am apprehensive about the next two. Lucas does not have the same humor and charm the first films had. A new cast of characters and actors make it even more distant. The visuals are great, much improved from 20 years ago, but Lucas does not have the same glorious elements of his first trilogy. Those elements include comic relief, inspired characters, and a frightening antagonist. The protagonists here are not as good as the first films. His characters are lacking and the charm just really does not work in the same spellbinding way as the first trilogy.",5,2,4,28 October 2011
United 93," A wonderful reflection of lives lost to 9/11
","I clapped after seeing the Paul Greengrass film United 93. The film is deserving of whatever praise it can get and the brave real-life heroes are just as worthy. The film shows 9/11 from two prospectives, the hostages fighting for their lives on Flight 93 and the air traffic controllers struggling to stop the bloodshed on the ground. It is one amazing movie that honors the people onboard the flight without forsaking entertainment value. The movie in my opinion marks The Bourne Supremacy director Paul Greengrass as a world-class filmmaker. Realistic with actual control operators portraying themselves and accurate depictions of the fear and terror aboard the flight. Beautiful movie-making at its finest.",10,1,3,27 August 2011
Casablanca," Hollywood at its most significant
","Casablanca is a Hollywood movie made in the peak of Hollywood filmmaking. A powerful romance so well-acted by a superb cast that includes Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The writing is excellent with a pitch-perfect running time and many lines that have become classic. All of these elements are expertly brought together by director Curtiz in his best film. It stands alongside Citizen Kane and Gone with the wind for the best movie ever made. It certainly features Hollywood at the peak of its form an engaging acting at the top of its form. Not one moment I regretted watching for a second but the end is the best part.",10,4,5,29 October 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Hollywood treat and a technological advancement
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit features filmmaker Robert Zemeckis at his best. The combination of cartoons and real-time is something not done prior or after this film so successfully. It's a lovely and cheerful film that does not pretend to be anything more than pure entertainment. Zemeckis also keeps his film in check in the sense that he does not let the new technology overwhelm his film's images or storytelling. That is what keeps this one so effective and masterful, unlike many films in the 21st century. The animation put against the real-time looks amazing because it does not come across as fake or industrial, it looks real and that is what establishes our credibility, even when we realize how far-fetched this fantasy is.",10,0,0,26 November 2011
Chinatown," Polanski's masterpiece of film noir
","Chinatown is one of the most excellent films to come from Roman Polanski. The screenplay builds a fine sense of unease and tension, keeping you thinking from start to finish. The characters are well-developed and especially well-acted. The storytelling is flawless, a perfect balance of mystery and romance. Filmed in Technicolor and with welcome appearances from John Huston and director Roman Polanski, it remains on the same level of Hollywood filmmaking as Casablanca and The Godfather. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are excellent in Oscar-nominated performances, but it is Robert Towne's screenplay that really makes strides.",10,1,2,8 July 2011
Unbreakable," Shyamalan's boring follow up to The Sixth Sense.
",M. Night Shyamalan follows up his compelling suspense thriller The Sixth Sense with this downbeat and very boring follow-up. Shyamalan spins his wheels with a clever comic book concept that seems to go nowhere. He tries to add a plot twist to the ending but the result is certainly not as good as the shocking ending in The Sixth Sense. There is nothing here other than a concept and a downbeat style of filmmaking that works more as a cure for insomnia rather than a compelling thriller. Shyamalan begins to descend as a filmmaker starting at this dreary film with no real point other than to demonstrate that Shyamalan can rip off himself.,5,0,1,26 November 2011
Star Trek," Star Trek is decent entertainment for all its junk.
","The Star Trek franchise has become a sensation across the globe and now TV Producer J.J Abrams comes out with a prequel to the franchise with modern special effects and modern actors to play the classic parts. A good idea, but Abrams does not really achieve his goal. I was bored more than enthralled by the storytelling. Zachary Quinto is good as Spock, a highlight of the otherwise ineffective reboot. The visuals are good with lots of neat insights on the famous franchise, but Abrams adds a lot of unneeded stylized crudeness and action scenes that do not really attain to the plot. It's not bad, but when you get down to it, only Star Trek junkies will give it the time of day.",6,1,5,23 August 2011
12 Angry Men," A must-see of simple filmmaking
","12 Angry Men-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sidney Lumet. Written by: Reginald Rose (from his own teleplay), Starring: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber.Sidney Lumet's first film explores a murder trial from the jury room based off the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Twelve men debate the fate of a Puerto Rican teenager on trial for the murder of his father. Eleven jurors think he is guilty and one (Fonda) thinks he is innocent.The amazing thing about the film is how the film pulls out emotion as well as logic in the trial. The two do not way each other out however. Lumet balances the racism and laziness of the eleven jurors with the unbiased nature of Fonda's character. Reginald Rose creates a perfect juror and an ideal protagonist while allowing Lumet to add claustrophobia and conflict to add to the film's relatively limited cinematic approach which adds to the experience of the play.Lumet's career was not always as successful as his first film and sometimes it was more powerful, but this is certainly not mediocre in any way. It makes better use of cinematic techniques in a theatrical narrative than most films like this. This also serves as one of the many high points in the career of Henry Fonda and a starting place for a number of character actors such as E.G Marshall, Ed Begley, and Jack Warden. The impact this film had on Lumet and Hollywood in general is as great as any film based off a play.",10,1,2,25 November 2011
The Notebook," Mostly good until the ending
","Nick Cassavetes' charming romantic drama grabbed me from the beginning. It was a spellbinding romance well-acted by Gosling and McAdams, backed up by Rowlands and Garner, two veteran actors. It was engaging, sweet, and even tear-jerking at times. It had a lot of heart, more heart than most romantic films in the 21st century do. Than the story went sour, the ending was contrived and almost felt laughable. The ending spoiled the film for me. Yet Cassavetes stages it well and the performances are vibrant from all four of the leads especially Rowlands in a very personal performance. Nick Cassavetes crafts this with personality like his father's films, despite all the flaws in Nicholas Sparks' writing.",6,0,0,25 October 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of Persia is lacking.
","Yet another movie based off a video game and yet another failure to bring gaming to the big screen. The action scenes are weak, full of B-meter special effects and stunts that are preposterous enough to make you cry. The sets pay homage to Pirates of the Caribbean, which I find annoying. Under the direction of adequate director Mike Newell and with a cast that includes Jake Gyllenhall, Ben Kingsley, and Alfred Molina, it cannot be easily dismissed. However like most of Jerry Bruckheimer's productions, it is made like an MTV made for television movie. Not worth the effort not even for teens. Adults will probably fall asleep, even video game fans.",4,3,6,9 July 2011
Dead Poets Society," Conventional but heart-felt and intelligent
","Robin Williams gives his best performance since George Roy Hill's The World According to Garp film adaptation. This film is no parody of Irving's masterpiece but it is a parody nevertheless. I appreciate anything that takes on such an insightful topic such as poetry or literature however. That is the intelligent aspect that gives Weir's film the power it possesses. Williams is outstanding and is given a talented cast of young actors to work alongside. What I really enjoyed was the Beatnik style of the script, which provides a great reflection on teenage counterculture which reminded me gladly of the preachings and work of Allen Ginsberg.",8,0,1,5 December 2011
Insomnia," A major improvement for Nolan
","I must admit that I am not a Chris Nolan fan. I do not buy into his style of often self-indulgence. But I also admit that when the closing credits for Insomnia began to roll, I was spellbound. A one of a kind dream-like thriller that grabs us from the start and never lets go as the horrors of insomnia and small-town murder unfold. Pacino is great as usual, but Williams is the center of the spotlight in a very uncharacteristic performance as a shady writer. Most people prefer Nolan's Inception or The Dark Knight over this, but I disagree completely. This is his most well-made and probably his only really well-made film.",9,0,0,21 October 2011
Juno," A commercial film with more personality than most.
","Juno was a rare surprise that made me quite impressed with director Jason Reitman. Reitman has marked himself as an intelligent filmmaker because he uses well-known stars such as Bateman and Garner so unconventionally and pairs them up with two talented young actors like Page and Cera, who both demonstrate great form here. Every actor is well-casted and Reitman hits the right notes through most of his storytelling. Juno is a character we might not want to like, but somehow she draws us in and not against our wishes. Warm comedy with insightful subject matter and Page wonderful in her breakthrough role as the pregnant girl.",9,1,3,5 December 2011
The Last Song," Sappy Cyrus vehicle
","Miley Cyrus takes on her first dramatic role and like most of this film's critics, I rolled my eyes. However, she was not bad and neither was Kinnear in his part. The flaw of the storytelling lies in Nicholas Sparks's atrociously sentimental and conventional writing. Nothing here is original and the ending is as sappy as always. Yet this is a lot better than the last Sparks film adaptation, Dear John. I could not sit through that idiot piece. This is much better than that and is more watchable, but it still is nothing that cannot be missed in the long run. The beaches are nice to look at and are more compelling than the story we are watching.",5,5,9,22 November 2011
Zodiac," Excellent heart-pounding thriller
","David Fincher has directed a number of different thrillers but this is by far his best. Zodiac grabs us and never lets go. The suspense is very well-executed and there are no flaws in the storytelling. It never ceases to ask us questions and there are moments where our heart skips a beat. It's long, but it does not feel that way because of its fluid storytelling and a long list of cast members. Everyone is great in it and Gyllenhall is great in his best role to date. It focuses less on the killings themselves and more on the reporters and police. Fincher is not pretending to know all there is to know about the Zodiac killer and that is what makes his storytelling so powerful.",10,1,2,12 November 2011
Gettysburg," Long but powerfully directed
","Gettysburg is both boring and powerful at the same time. The production values are truly what makes this film so compelling to watch and the acting is powerful especially by Sheen and Daniels. The movie goes on and on for 4 long hours and often challenges our attention span especially if the civil war does not interest you. Many of the battle scenes are very well-staged however and the filming on Gettysburg National Park itself has never been more authentic and real in a war movie. If you enjoy war films and you appreciate long movies, you should be as entranced as always by the climatic and cinematic storytelling.",7,0,1,23 November 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's satire is still a monument of filmmaking
",Stanley Kubrick's cold war satire still remains one of the greatest black comedies but also one of the monuments of filmmaking. It takes accurate looks at war and society's reaction to war with the common Kubrick theme of dehumanization. The only difference here is that Kubrick is playing us for laughs. That is what makes this one Kubrick's most accessible masterpiece. His observations still remain both insightful and relevant today and Sellers' multiple performances only grow in power with age. Each performance is more funny than the last! A Kubrick masterpiece that may even top his dramatic films in sheer power and social observation.,10,2,5,23 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Star Wars original trilogy finishes with a bang
","The first two films were enthralling; would the third carry it out? While not as powerful as the first two, Return of the Jedi does not fail to entertain. The film is imaginative just like all the other Star Wars films with enough new special effects to hold our eyes on the screen. The plot makes sense and delivers the same fun punch as the previous films. Seeing the characters evolve over the three films is a pleasure and the trilogy ends nicely here, we feel resolved by the film's happy energy, which is the best way to end a saga. In chorus with its predecessors, it remains a strong piece of storytelling and special effects.",9,0,1,26 July 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Excellent fantasy
","Pan's Labyrinth-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Guillermo del Toro. Written by: Guillermo del Toro, Starring: Sergi Lopez, Maribel Verdu, Ivana Baquero, Alex Angulo, Doug Jones, Ariadna Gil, Manolo Sol, Roger Casamajor.When the term fantasy film comes to mind, one normally thinks of Lord of the Rings or Alice in Wonderland. What does not come to mind is a masterpiece made for art house viewings. Yet that is exactly what this film represents, a contradiction to Hollywood fantasy. The story covers a young girl (Baquero) who finds peace and security in a fantasy world where she must prove herself as queen of. However, reality rears its ugly head and forces Baquero into the sinister world of fascist Spain in 1944 under the wrath of her violent step-father (Lopez).What gives this art house film by Guillermo del Toro its brilliance is how it combines a brutally violent reality with a truly beautiful fantasy. The two do not play off each other and that is where del Toro's talent as a filmmaker comes in. He makes sure the two contradicting parts of the story do not play against each other and make the movie uneven, instead the two work together as a consistent whole. This is where most current Hollywood filmmakers go wrong is their inability to bring even the slightest of contradicting story elements together.The bleakness of reality is shockingly portrayed through Lopez's character who murders people for his own satisfaction. The innocence of the fantasy is portrayed through Baquero's innocent character who simply wants a world of love around her. del Toro understands that a masterpiece of art does not just have one level, it has multiple levels of thought process in order to completely understand it. He uses characters to convey the symbolism of both of his worlds he has created and he also questions us in the fact that the fantasy world actually exists.Is the fantasy world just an imaginary place or a real place discovered by a young girl? He leaves those questions up to us. He tells his story and then leaves the rest for us to reflect on. That is what makes this a work of art, not a work of commercial filmmaking. It's beautiful and horrifying, it's lovely and hateful, it's a masterpiece.",10,2,4,28 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than the first prequel
","Lucas's first prequel let audiences down due to the lack of characterization and good dialogue. This one is much the same but the battle scenes are more exciting and the story is starting to emerge in its connection to the originals. The battle scenes are fun to watch and the romance scenes on Naboo are great, but the characters are simply not as inspired as the first trilogy. The film seems personal but the characters seem rather impersonal. Some of this is good and some is dull, but Lucas does manage to keep us wanting for his third installment somehow. I hope it will be better than the first two films in the prequel trilogy.",6,2,5,29 October 2011
Forrest Gump," A film of irony and best of all, beauty
","Robert Zemeckis's loose adaptation of Winston Groom's satirical novel still remains one of the most talked about films of the '90s. The irony and satire of the novel is still there, but Hanks's performance and Zemeckis's direction is what makes it beautiful. One of the best sentimental films of all time! Zemeckis weaves Hanks into archive footage and his combination of satire and sentimentality is what makes this masterpiece so beautiful and effective. It's a beautiful story and has Zemeckis's signature visual creativity for good measure. I could not hold back the tears at the arguably beautiful ending and I doubt few can.",10,1,2,26 November 2011
Gone Baby Gone," Mostly a bore.
","Gone Baby Gone marks Ben Affleck's directorial debut and another boring film. I think Affleck did a great job in his casting, all the actors are at the peak of their form especially the extras who feel genuine. The ending is also thought-provoking but it is too bad the film is so boring. The movie goes on far too long and twists its plot so far that it becomes silly. In the end it is more preposterous than ridiculous. I had the same problem with Mystic River, another Lehane adaptation. Though that one was better-written and directed, this one seems to be what is left over from Mystic River. Affleck did the best he could and there are no losers in the cast, just the writing and source material itself.",4,0,1,12 November 2011
"Monsters, Inc."," Monsters, Inc. is no masterpiece, but it certainly is entertainment
","Pixar's third feature is good entertainment especially with a comedian like Billy Crystal voicing. Not as emotionally powerful or complex as Toy Story and certainly no classic, but for the kids and most adults willing to accept an optimistic story, a fun ride. It is full of good storytelling and good visuals, plus a talented voice cast to follow it up. There are many missteps in execution but by the time you get involved with the plight of its characters, you will latch on to it. Kids will enjoy it and adults will most likely find something to their liking within all the slapstick and humor aimed at small children in paricular.",7,0,1,10 July 2011
Fargo," Fargo is another intelligent laugh fest from the Coens.
","Fargo is an all-out laugh fest with excellent performances and clever insights. There is plenty of violence, but there is also plenty of social commentary on Minnesota types. Frances McDormand is wonderful in her Oscar-winning role and so are Buscemi and Macy in their roles. The way the characters talk and interact is utterly hilarious. Ultimately the blend of Minnesota Personalities and murder commentary, added with a moral value at the end to make it more morally correct add up to make a modern classic. Kudos to Joel and Ethan Coen for making horrific violence funny in the darkest of ways and to Roger Deakins and his beautiful cinematography.",9,0,1,16 August 2011
The Aviator," The Aviator is not a movie from 2004, but really the way movies at their best used to be.
","The Aviator-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Martin Scorsese. Written by: John Logan, Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Adam Scott, Matt Ross, Kelli Garner, Brent Spiner, Edward Herrmann, Willem Dafoe.The life of Howard Hughes is vividly re-told in Scorsese's film adaptation, going through his life as a filmmaker and pilot, his marriage to Katherine Hepburn, and his battle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. All of which take place between the years of 1927-1947.When we call a film a masterpiece, we normally have symbolism, originality, and pure brilliance in the way that the director presents his action. This is a somewhat different case because though it has some of those qualities, it is mostly an excellent film because of how efficient Scorsese is as a director. The reason I call this a masterpiece is because I found it impossible to find flaws with it, not because of any symbolism or figurative storytelling.The cinematography by Robert Richardson and the set design by Dante Ferretti are both shockingly creative in the fact that they make you feel like you are back in Howard Hughes's time period. Costume designs by Sandra Powell do not take away from the overall experience either. The real brilliance behind the film however is how Scorsese and DiCaprio make Hughes a more likable character than Katherine Hepburn or Spencer Tracy. Hughes is a connectible character despite the fact that he is a half-insane womanizer. Scorsese's direction is piercingly honest but beautifully touching much like Raging Bull.The performances are powerful as well especially DiCaprio and Blanchett as Hughes and Hepburn. Beckinsale gets a good chance to show off her beauty as Ava Gardner and Alda gets a great role to work with as well. Yet the most prevailing thing about it is the flawless portrait of a man with psychological disorder and a brilliance in innovation that finds a way to beat his problems no matter how daunting they are.",10,0,0,22 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Jackson's first installment of epic fantasy works is a success.
","The beginning of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is a fantastic work of movie-making. The use of state of the art visual effects works to the benefit of Tolkien's story. The epic production values are outstanding and so is the cast that includes Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, and Cate Blanchett. Jackson stays loyal to Tolkien but builds the film to his liking and takes creative liberties to the story without ruining the adaptation. The score is magnificent and few fantasy films have such a great look and atmosphere to them like this film does. Staggering and original direction by Peter Jackson in his best picture yet.",9,0,0,9 July 2011
Cast Away," Worthwhile for Hanks's performance
","Filmmaker Robert Zemeckis has stylishly and artistically made an impact on pop culture with his unique movies. Cast Away is one of those films that made an impact of cultural substance. Tom Hanks gives a great performance as the central character and only Hanks could make him so likable. Hanks's strong, moving performance keeps us from losing attention in the story, however preposterous it may be. The movie is overlong and flawed, but it has great moments of seriocomedy and melodrama. Zemeckis does manage to give us insights into isolation and half-insanity with masterful results. Hanks fans should love it, despite all the flaws in realism that Zemeckis does mange to redeem through his solid storytelling.",8,2,3,29 October 2011
The Village," Utter trash
","The Village-*-Worthless- Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan. Written by: M. Night Shyamalan, Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones, John Christopher Jones, Celia Watson, Judy Greer, Jayne Atkinson, Fran Kranz, Michael Pitt, Jesse Eisenberg, Frank Collison.Director M. Night Shyamalan's downward spiral begins with this horrendous film that is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous in every sense of the word. The film details a village that somehow is alienated from society with people kept within the borders because of outsiders that lurk in the surrounding forest. The elders of the village refuse to let anyone outside of the borders even at Phoenix's demands.This is not only a silly plot but it is relentlessly downbeat with no factor of entertainment whatsoever. Shyamalan takes all the energy out of the film to meet his own demands to emphasize the villager's loneliness. I did not feel any loneliness from his direction and actually felt more entitled to leave this film than anything. The actors seem just as bored as the audience in reality. No one seems to be enjoying any of their roles.Shyamalan is intent upon making the same success that The Sixth Sense brought in for him. The elements that Shyamalan used in The Sixth Sense can be found though they are not even scarcely close to the sheer power his first spooky fest had over us. The end plot twist here only demeans the experience, rather than enhancing it. Shyamalan really should have identified that his talent as a director were virtually limited to one film. He is just making spin-offs now.",1,2,4,28 October 2011
Knowing," Knowing is a preposterous film that turns out laughable.
","There are plenty of weird films with obnoxious plot elements out there, but none rival the sheer laughable absurdity of Knowing. Knowing starts out very clever and intense and just when it looks like its going to be a great movie, it runs out of ideas. The film has a really good concept, but the execution is weak and lacking. I applaud the writers for not falling into clichés, but this tries a little too hard. Ultimately, Knowing comes out empty handed and often laughable. There is one thing that I do like about it though, the disaster scenes really give you the feeling of being there. Director Proyas does a good job with that, but little else.",5,2,5,24 July 2011
The Shining," A masterpiece
","The Shining-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick. Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Diane Johnson, Starring: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers, Barry Nelson, Joe Turkel.Kubrick's intense film based off Stephen King's novel follows the story of a writer (Nicholson) who takes his family to an abandoned hotel, which causes a violent reaction from him as surreal images flood his mind. His wife (Duvall) does not know what to make of her husband's sudden descent or their young son's strange behavior. Much horror follows this up.Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King had well-known creative differences over the project. King had a more paranormal approach to the haunting of Nicholson's character which is more straightforward in why these events are happening. Kubrick's adaptation is more focused on the dehumanization of Nicholson's character and less clear on what his evil behavior is coming from.That is the reason Kubrick's version prevails is because it is hazy. The film could be a psychological reaction to the claustrophobic environment of the hotel, a schizophrenic fantasy, or like King would have it, a response to the paranormal entities of the hotel. Or it could be all of the above. Perhaps Nicholson's character is provoked into violence by the spirits.The next question we must ask is if it should be taken literally or as a work of symbolism or both. Kubrick is not stuffing words and explanations to the change of character into our mouthes, but he gives us enough explanation to at least make sense of the horror going on. Nicholson is excellent in the main role because his change in attitude is not too quick nor too slow. Pairing him up with Duvall, Kubrick contrasts the two personalities and better shows Nicholson's hatred as in comparison with Duvall's innocence. Duvall gives Kubrick and Nicholson a frame to work with in order to display how horrible the lead character really is. The genius of the film is how Kubrick portrays his characters in a claustrophobic and hallucinatory backdrop.",9,0,0,2 August 2011
American Beauty," American Beauty is a pure masterpiece.
","American Beauty-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sam Mendes, Written by: Alan Ball Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley.Sam Mendes' first feature presents an affectionate and satirical look at American life in the suburbs centering around a dysfunctional family trying to find the meaning of life amongst all the chaos of their lives. Spacey is trying to relive his teenage years which leads him into domestic, professional, sexual, and financial difficulty. Bening is his uptight wife and looks for sex from other extramarital sources. Birch is their teenage daughter who is attracted with a kid next door obsessed with his video camera and whose family troubles involve psychological disorder and sexual repression.Mendes develops characters for his satire, not caricatures and keeps the perception of society reasonable and believable. The characters are certainly not role models, but they are likable. Spacey, our protagonist, is sexually attached to a teenage girl, quits his job, and smokes pot. What's heroic or likable about those qualities? That is where Mendes (along with Ball)'s genius comes into play. The members of society we normally look down upon are the film's heroes, mostly it is because they are the normal characters of today's society.That is the piercing honesty that makes this film so acidic in its delivery. Cooper's character, a homophobic marine, a man society would most likely look up to is the film's antagonist. This reflects cultural shifts and the irony of the proposed American lifestyle over the true perception we have over our lives. That is the poison this film holds to our heads and refuses to let go until it forces an honest reaction over all the programmed reactions we force ourselves to have for the sake of being well-liked and appreciated in our communities.The romance between Birch and Bentley is the only relationship in the film that is driven out of love and not sex or status. Bentley's character is the most ironic point Mendes makes within the film because he appears the weirdest and most perverted but he turns out the most honest and beautiful. This further emphasizes Mendes' point that life is different from the outside looking in rather than the inside looking out.Mendes changes the way we look at each other and the way we look at ourselves. He questions appearances and frames of mind, much like Todd Solondz's Happiness. Though that film's mastery is evident, this is the most connectible American drama/satire released in years.",10,1,2,16 August 2011
Spider-Man," Nothing but effects.
","Spiderman is a corny adaptation of the Marvel comic book with even cornier effects to showcase it. Maguire is surprisingly dull in the lead part and none of the other actors are there to help him out. it all plays out like a badly-written video game. I have never cared about films with lots of special effects and little story, but Spiderman confirms my dislike because of corny and overused special effects and no story that has never been told better before. Raimi is not going for anything having to do with characters, he is simply showcasing a large amount of effects on yet another digital backdrop. Simmons does add some great comic relief to the story however and Dafoe is not bad as the lead villain, but that is about it here.",4,0,1,25 November 2011
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Azkaban is better than the other Potters.
",The producers made their wisest decision in the Potter franchise yet by switching from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron in the directing position. Cuaron keeps a firm hold on the magical aspects of the story while going into darker territory. The film has more complexities and challenges the viewer more than the previous two chapters. It successfully and even compellingly exploits the intricacies from Rowling's tale and also keeps the content manageable for their marketed age range. Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban tops the other two films well and sets up the fourth chapter well. A victory for Director Alfonso Cuaron and the great cast of talents.,8,1,2,24 October 2011
Gandhi," Attenborough's shining attribute as a filmmaker.
","Richard Attenborough's career has been uneven, but this is his shining moment. Gandhi's life and philosophy called for a movie and this certainly meets the requirement and also surpasses the requirements for a Gandhi biopic. This is purely cinematic filmmaking with Kingsley in his Oscar-winning role as the philosopher. It's made with the scope of Lawrence of Arabia and with the intimacy of It's a Wonderful Life. a truly remarkable accomplishment about a truly remarkable man. A must-see for all audiences. Daniel Day-Lewis makes a cameo as a street thug. Attenborough's best and most intimate; Kingsley's finest performance as an actor.",10,1,1,3 December 2011
Ocean's Eleven," Indulgence is what this remake is about, but that's okay.
","No, Ocean's Eleven is no masterpiece and it's not art either, it's just entertainment. Indulgence for the stars and fans of the stars. I normally detest such films, but I liked this one. How could you not like a movie with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, and Don Cheadle? It is obvious the actors had fun with this and so did I to a certain extent. The film is a remake of a 1960 Frank Sinatra vehicle and it appears that director Steven Soderbergh may have even improved off of it. Like Men in Black or Ghostbusters, it is just fun for the stars and it's fun for the viewers too. Although I disagree with the two sequels to the film, I enjoyed this installment.",7,0,2,22 July 2011
Gone with the Wind," Still as beautiful as was in 1939.
",Gone with the wind is a soaper set against the most splendid of backdrops; the civil war. 4 hours have never passed faster and rivals Citizen Kane for one of the strongest films ever made. Leigh and Gable are still the most memorable couple in cinematic history and their romantic scenes are wonderful to watch. David O. Selznick's crowning achievement as a producer and Fleming's best film as a director. The technicolor (which is signature of Fleming's films) is still some of the richest and most powerful of film history. This took audiences and critics away in 1939 and it does not fail to enthrall even today. it actually only improves with age.,10,1,1,26 November 2011
No Country for Old Men," Very powerful Coen Bros. film
","No Country for Old Men is a powerful thriller filmed to perfection by Joel and Ethan Coen. The performances are searing but what really wins this film over is the Coens' inventive techniques in creating suspense, throwing in comic relief, and finally having a quirky but effective choreography of violence. It's a potent thriller full of great shots of the landscape and the suspense techniques intelligently use brutal violence and plenty of great camera work. Bardem gives his strongest performance of his career as the killer. The symbolism and cultural satire the Coens throw in is that of two filmmakers who know how to powerfully create both a violent and very humorous film in the same shot.",9,3,5,7 November 2011
District 9," Fascinating and interesting original.
","Neil Blomkamp's first feature is an incredible work of filmmaking filmed in documentary style. The special effects are absolutely convincing in building us a parallel universe. Blomkamp uses visuals to tell his story and does not get carried away with the effects. His storytelling is effective and powerful, if a bit crude at times. The sheer power of the execution is shattering and has no mainstream stars to bear, which makes the fact of how popular this movie is directly due to how strong the storytelling is and how powerful the images of the aliens are. A real gem of special effects storytelling and off-beat Hollywood mockumentaries.",9,0,4,19 November 2011
Remember the Titans," If you enjoy sentimental films, watch it.
","Remember the Titans is a sentimental picture about racism and teamwork done in sappy, emotional style. It's very corny at times because it deals with a melodramatic issue. Any Spike Lee film takes on these issues better than this, but the messages are true and everyone puts on a good performance. However it is Washington that pulls the film across in his powerhouse performance as the head coach. I liked the dialogue, especially when Washington is saying the lines. The execution is melodramatic, but if you like films about this type of thing than you should enjoy it a lot. I admit the film is honest and sincere and is often quite funny.",7,1,2,26 November 2011
Twilight," It is not really half bad.
","I know that a lot of people detest Twilight and a lot of people love it. I am neither, I don't love it but I don't hate it either. Teenage girls gobble this movie up and I did not really dislike it too badly either. I will call Pattinson and Stewart's performances overkill, but Stephanie Meyer's idea is pretty inventive combining paranormal with teenage romance. The story isn't bad either and though it has to wallow through corniness and teenage girl marketing to reach its potential it still is pretty entertaining to watch. A new spin on the vampire world may have been something The World needed, so the next time you want to roll your eyes at all the screaming teenage girls craving more Twilight, just remember it is not all that bad.",7,1,4,2 September 2011
The Pianist," Polanski's most rewarding masterpiece.
","After declining to direct Schindler's List due to personal reasons, Polanski set out direct a WWII survival story of his own. The Pianist lacks the narrative sweep of Schindler's List but has strong acting and personal direction. The film is beautifully crafted and original from other similar motion pictures. It distinguishes itself from Polanski's other masterpieces because it has the heart his films usually do not possess. It's just as haunting as his other movies but the beauty and sickness of humanity are contrasted in a way that not even Polanski has ever successfully done before. By far Adrien Brody's finest performance and probably Polanski's best film.",10,1,1,25 November 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," Long, spectacular David Lean epic.
",David Lean's 1962 blockbuster filmed on a grand scale still remains one of the most influential blockbusters of all time with battle scenes that still look amazing today. It tops even The Bridge on the River Kwai in terms of epic storytelling. Peter O'Toole hits the character of Lawrence right on the nose and Guinness also gets a great role that allows him to expand with his acting technique. Yet the budget and the sheer effort that went into this filmmaking is what really makes this one so interesting to watch for over 3 hours. Few blockbusters have such an emphasis on psychological idiosyncrasies than Lean's film. That is why Lean is more advanced in storytelling against DeMille or Stevens.,10,1,3,4 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Interesting but boring
","Rupert Wyatt's prequel to the legendary 1968 film has its moments, but inconsistently shifts into boring and overlong passages too often and is rather pretentious in its CGI work. The finale is gripping and inviting, with heart-pounding action, but Wyatt's film plods too long, not reaching its punchline fast enough and loses our attention from the truly good parts of the picture. The film features some convincing special effects but lacks the thrusts it needs to propel itself. Fortunately enough, the film does manage to salvage some of my respect I saw from the boring action-filled advertisements. A mediocre action flick at best.",5,1,2,9 June 2012
Insidious," A snooze fest for film buffs
","Yet another contrived Hollywood demon oriented horror film with little edge or fun for that matter. The writers are too busy trying to dodge the clichés of The exorcist and their previous Paranormal Activity that they do not realize how out of wack their story is. The story is so far fetched in the second half that the horror does not even work. Horror is about believability, taking something audiences can relate to and expanding on the concept to scare them. Director James Won pulls across little believability and little stylistics to make up for it and the result is lacking. I cannot pan it due to its desire to be original but I cannot like it either for the absurdity of the plot elements. Film buffs should move on.",5,0,1,13 September 2011
2012," 2012 is an overall special effects game
","2012-**-Not Good- Directed by: Roland Emmerich, Written by: Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser. Starring: John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, Tom McCarthy, George Segal, Stephen McHattie, Patrick Bauchau, Beatrice Rosen, Johann Urb.Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day) continues his saga of big and special effects consumed blockbusters with this film about a man and struggling writer (Cusack) who finds out about a world apocalypse the government has tried to cover up and tries to deliver his family to safety as the world is engulfed by destruction.Emmerich has little personality or complexity in any of his characters, the family he centers his film around is so utterly boring and full of cliché that it becomes impossible to be totally involved with them without producing a giggle. His intentions are honest however, despite this little clichéd characters.He also provides little context for the struggle going on with his characters. The explanations he has for all the explosions and destruction is a solar mishap any scientist could easily overlook. He has no reason for all of his destruction and we slowly grow numb in the minds as this plays out.It is the special effects that most people come for, but if you look at cinema as just being all special effects and no storytelling than that is a very limited experience. Emmerich did worse in his previous The Day After Tomorrow, but did better in Independence Day.",6,0,4,12 July 2011
Hellboy," Comic book thrills from del Toro
","I have never much been a fan of the new superhero films but I did enjoy Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy. This is far better than average comic book films because it looks more rich and has a lot of neat visuals that have more of an eye-popping appeal than most films like this. The comic relief and sarcasm are especially well-done by Perlman in a good performance. Few films deal with such a heavy weight subject like Satan and do it to such a good effect. The effect of this is not offensive toward the religious. This showcase del Toro's artful handling of fantasy at not necessarily his best, but definitely at his most fun to watch.",7,0,0,29 October 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Jackson's second installment of Lordo f the Rings franchise is excellent.
","After grabbing critical and commercial acclaim to his first installment of his trilogy, Director Peter Jackson moves on to the second film. The Two Towers is excellent, a delight to watch. Andy Serkis's performance added with the CGI make Gollum, a convincing critter, one of the highlights of the film. The battle scenes look amazing on camera and the film amps up the climatic scope to make the movie better than the first and it works! The story follows Frodo and Sam, still on their way to Mordor as they face trials and tribulations of their journey. Meanwhile Aragorn and their former companions wage war on the forces of evil. Arresting, epic entertainment that nicely sets up the grand finale.",9,0,1,20 July 2011
Schindler's List," Spielberg's timeless masterpiece
","Schindler's List was the first film by Steven Spielberg since Jaws I can genuinely call a masterpiece. Schindler's List is the highlight of the 90's, a touching look into humanism and a frightening look into the Holocaust. Filmed in Black and white (a very good decision from Spielberg) and as grand as Hollywood's most classic works, Schindler's List claims itself at the top of 90's filmmaking. All three leads are magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over and stylized. A triumph for Steven Spielberg and the cast and crew. It is certainly the most impressive Spielberg film and perhaps the best film of the 1990's.",10,11,16,2 August 2011
The Incredibles," The Incredibles is no masterpiece, just unintelligent fun
","The Incredibles is not the best of Pixar and it only pays off as cheap thrill, but it is fun. The film is likable and the action scenes are pretty nicely-done, but it lacks the child like charm of Toy Story or the heart warming adventure of Finding Nemo. Still fun to watch for all of the stylized action everywhere. You will not shed a tear or get any new feelings after watching this, but you certainly will be entertained by the visual spectacle. The Incredibles does plenty of wrongs in its execution, but it also does plenty of rights, good for kids and a few nice thrills for adults, but certainly not the most enjoyable or masterful of the computer-sparked Pixar.",8,0,0,26 July 2011
I Am Legend," I am Legend is cheesy and relatively dull in my opinion
","Zombies have influenced a number of horror films and I am Legend is another on the list. I think it is a pretty minor offering, with zombies that look cheesy and Will Smith's campy performance weighing it down. However the director's suspense buildup is pretty masterful, making a few truly scary moments. Manhattan looks good in post apocalyptic form, but the movie looks better on paper than it does on the silver screen, which simply is not acceptable. For zombie fans, this is too layed back. For Will Smith fans, this is perfect fodder because he yells and screams just as much here as in previous offerings.",5,0,0,9 July 2011
Patton," Scott's performance makes the movie
","George C. Scott's performance as General George Patton is by far, one of the greatest in cinema history and fortunately, he gets a script that matches his prowess in acting. The script (co-written by Francis Coppola) is well-written, focusing on a small portion of the general's life in pure detail, underlining both the positives and the negatives of the eccentric man. But though everything in this film is just nearly perfect, it is Scott who truly wins over his audience. Malden also puts on a notable effort as General Omar Bradley and the battle scenes are perfectly choreographed by an expert crew, but then again, it is the on-screen personalities who win this one over.",9,1,2,2 August 2012
Children of Men," A superb action film.
","Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men is not only one of the better action thrillers of 2006, but one of the best films of the year. The futuristic atmosphere is so intelligently created by Cuaron and without heavy use of special effects. The action scenes are especially realistic and well-made without campy choreography. It's a thought provoking film about a future gone wrong. This is very memorable because it analyzes the plot more than the violence and has little action cliché. It will leave you breathless by the time it finishes. Compelling performances only add to the overall experience, which is far better than average action films. This look at a bleak future is one of the better of its time and genre.",9,3,6,1 December 2011
Million Dollar Baby," Good study from Eastwood
","Million Dollar Baby is arguably the most well-acted film of 2004 and the most compelling. It holds our attention almost all the way through with its passionate storytelling. Swank and Freeman are both entrancing in Oscar-winning efforts and Eastwood is no less enthralling as Swank's grizzled trainer. Eastwood does not focus on as much the boxing itself, but the nature of the characters that participate in the sport. The only flaw is the murky, strange ending that does not sum up the film in the way our emotions want. However, 95% of this is excellent movie-making that challenges the viewer to think, not just watch and listen.",8,1,1,22 October 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Personal and provocative
","Clooney brings this film to life like no other director could have. Clooney, who had been involved in some outspoken journalism issues himself directs this with passion and power. The film not only masterfully uses archive news footage but also envisions what the conversations behind Murrow's news shows were like. The director combines the two and uses black and white to capture the time period with a talented cast acting the parts to perfection. Few films manage to convince us of time period and historical journalism like this powerful film. Not only a great piece of work but a powerful historical document as well. A real wonder.",9,2,3,7 November 2011
Mulholland Drive," Powerful, spellbinding David Lynch film
","Mulholland Dr.-***1/2- Excellent- Directed by: David Lynch. Written by: David Lynch, Starring: Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, Scott Wulf, Robert Forster, Brent Briscoe, Dan Hedaya, Michael Des Barres, Billy Ray Cyrus, Katharine Towne, Lee Grant, James Karen, Chad Everett.Lynch directs yet another bizarre, steamy, and overall masterful thriller about a young actress (Watts in her best performance yet) who arrives in Hollywood with big dreams when she meets an amnesiac woman (Harring) who is involved in a complex and disturbing mystery.Surreal like the body of most of Lynch's work but this is one of his best films. The mystery of the film is what grabs us. Lynch's use of first person point of view and slowly zooming up on objects give us a great feeling of dream-like horror. It is Hitchcock-type suspense until the first two-thirds are over. Then it dives into pure Lynch originality full of disturbing violent images and shocking eroticism.Watts's character changes from a friendly and bubbly young lady to a dark and perverted woman. Her character completely changes and if we look at this change of character or the plot in general as consistent, then it will make no sense. Lynch's film may be one whole dream though I believe it that Watts's original personality was the dream and her other personality was her reality, but she refused to accept it.The plot can be interpreted multiple ways but what is undeniable is Lynch's strength in dream-like eroticism which he effectively displays through the relationship between Watts and Harring. He is also great in his satirical points on his portrait of contemporary Hollywood, which is a contradiction of his usual small town setting. This is a great thriller with excellent performances by all and a filmmaker with plenty of dream-like images that are frighteningly realistic.",9,6,10,25 November 2011
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Boy in the striped pajamas succeeds, but does not excel
","The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not the most chilling, accurate, or meticulous account of concentration camp horror, but it still is a heartwarming account of a time of hatred and rage. The story shows the friendship between two boys, one a Jew, one a Nazi son as they make friends while separated by the fences of the camp. Yet as their friendship deepens, so does the hatred growing around them, putting their friendship at risk. It is certainly contrived in every way and the use of British Actors takes away the realism of the story. Still compelling and touching though, with two deeply felt performances by the youths.",8,1,1,9 July 2011
The Last Emperor," Bertolucci's masterpiece
","The Last Emperor is one of the three Best Pictures to win every Oscar they were nominated for and rightfully so. Beautifully filmed within The Forbidden City with epic production values and with an honest narrative, it remains one of the most powerful biopics of all time. Bertolucci's most touching and powerful film to date. The main character remains rather cold-blooded throughout is accurately depicted, but still respectfully identified. Like every great filmmaker, Bertolucci respects the settings and characters and never fails to give us a bit of heart here and there and a bit of truth when needed.",10,0,0,20 August 2011
Big Fish," Tim Burton's masterpiece!
","Big Fish proves that Burton is as good as any other director in Hollywood. This is a beautiful and heartwarming story that showcases Burton's oddball reality alongside fine cinematography and a beautiful script that instead of focusing on the weird, focuses on beauty and love with Burton's usual flamboyantly bizarre images thrown in. The result is a masterpiece of storytelling with McGregor in his best performance yet and Buscemi in a great comic relief piece. This is certainly an example of original storytelling, but it is also an example of how filmmakers can use different narratives to tell virtually the same story but in a stunningly fresh and witty format. Do not hold back the tears, they will come out anyway.",10,0,0,26 November 2011
The Dark Knight," Watch the Tim Burton movie or better yet, read the comic book!
","I find myself yet again thrown against director Christopher Nolan's films. The Dark Knight was the audience's favorite of 2008, mostly because of the great performances. I found myself loving the performances and even some of the creative action sequences played out. I even enjoyed the first half. Than Nolan's film began to make unnecessary twists and turns that marked self-indulgence. The movie did not even know where it was going and suddenly I felt repulsed by it. It's so bloated with self-indulgence and characters that do not even make sense. It's not a humanistic movie, but it's not dehumanized either. It just does not make sense. Yes, Ledger is great. Yes, Bale's great, but is this movie great? Absolutely not.",8,1,2,26 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Yates' pacing wins it over.
","Director David Yates replaces Mike Newell in the directing position on the Potter films and gives the Potter series a victory. This book was the longest, which makes it incredible that Yates squashed this down into the shortest of the film adaptations. It does not feel squashed together though, Yates understands our need for a good pace and that is what he incorporates into his filmmaking here. His direction is not as fragmented and uneven as Newell's and he does everything Newell tried to do in The Goblet of Fire, which is getting down the emotions of the characters while telling his fictional fantasy tale. The Potter series may have found a director yet, other than Cuaron.",8,0,2,26 November 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001 is Kubrick's exciting adventure into space.
","2001: A Space Odyssey-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick, Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke (Novel and Screenplay), Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, voice of Douglas Rain.Stanley Kubrick's most provocative masterpiece follows the adventure into the unknown depths of space to investigate strange objects found on the surface of The Moon that are related to the very origins of mankind itself.Kubrick starts this masterpiece at the dawn of man showing us the origins of men at the hands of a monolith. The monoliths are large black objects in the physical interpretation of the film. The monoliths are up to interpretation however, some have interpreted them as alien objects while others have come up with the figurative representation of human evolution.Afterwards, he takes a leap into his pre-conceived future of 2001 that still remains relevant in today's society. Then, the odyssey begins when a monolith is found on The Moon, the odyssey takes off. This leads an astronaut straight into immortality and alien worlds.Dullea's character evolves in the film's final sequence into the star child. This ending along with the rest of the film has been interpreted both physically and figuratively. This movie is a masterpiece simply because of all the physical effects, figurative symbolism, and perhaps metaphysical explanations. It continues to be debated over whether or not it is a work of a a man of God or a man of science. That is part of the deliberate process is the contemplation of the less straightforward materials of the film.",10,0,3,22 July 2011
Singin' in the Rain," The high point of movie musicals
","This is one of the finest movies ever made and arguably the most engaging musical ever made. Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have a great eye for musical numbers and for hilarious comic relief. Each number is masterfully executed and the numbers are done in the best style. They build up and keep getting better, rather than giving all the great stuff first. Kelly is a superb actor/dancer/singer/co-director and is what makes this film such an enjoyable movie to watch. Stanley Donen helps out plenty though and is great with the musical stuff. The choreography remains just as strong today. Compare this next to Chicago, the Oscar-winning musical a half-century later and see how much more powerful the choreography and cinematography is over that one.",10,0,2,26 November 2011
Avatar," Avatar is the visual landmark of our time
","It has been 12 years since James Cameron pulled in 11 Oscars with Titanic and now he returns with a sci-fi yarn that pops our eyes like no movie has ever done before. The visual effects are outstanding, not since Lord of the rings has a film shown as powerful of visuals as this. Not the most grappling story, but definitely the most grappling visuals and battle scenes, not once did I want to take my eyes off the silver screen. CGI is rarely better than this and is definitely worth appreciation. The message Director Cameron wanted to imply is that humans must learn to respect the resources more that we have. Cameron masterfully weaves that message into pure cinematic storytelling and turns out a hit!",9,1,6,9 July 2011
Drag Me to Hell," Campy but effective horror film.
",I have never really enjoyed devil or demon-oriented films but this one is pretty good of its type. Sam Raimi returns to his horror roots and directs it with plenty of gross-out horror with humor laced in between. The delivery overall is engaging and not completely disgusting or downbeat for that matter. The comic relief is well-needed and well-used to the film's benefit. Personally I would choose Raimi's lower budget horror above this but it is still interesting entertainment and full of lots of scary creature effects that are always effective when on screen. Raimi has his biggest commercial if not artistic triumph since his Spiderman movies.,9,0,0,17 November 2011
Super 8," An action film with emotion.
","When we look at the limited genre of stylized action films, there are few that really take us into another world. Super 8 is a rare breed of action film that engages us on an emotional level along with a visual one. What I really like about it is how personal this is to director Abrams. Abrams is engaging in parody, which he is no stranger to, but this is his finest film yet with a plot that makes sense during the action scenes. He's got nothing on Spielberg(who produced this), but he does manage to succeed in terms of fluid storytelling, American charm, and enthralling visuals. This is one of the better Spielberg impressions and definitely the best of Abrams.",9,1,2,5 December 2011
Up," Up is Pixar's most effective film to date.
","Up is the Pixar film that towers over all the other Pixar films. The emotional impact of it is even more powerful than even some Disney Classics such as The Lion King. Do not worry though because the film does have lots and lots of good old slapstick humor and best of all no crude pop references. The film follows an elderly widower (voice of Ed Asner)as he journeys to his late wife's dream vacation but finds himself entangled with a boy scout, a giant bird, and a talking dog. Funny and touching to say the least, Up is one of the greats, an instant classic that will keep people talking until movies themselves wither away. Pixar's Best.",10,1,2,9 July 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's winning first thriller/shocker
","Quentin Tarantino's shocking but nevertheless fluid thriller set the stage for him to become one of America's most original directors. The film starts off with the classic Tarantino side-talking routine, that he would later explore in Pulp Fiction. It slowly develops into a violent thriller in the vein of The Killing (1956). There is something compelling and original about all the violence and destruction in this film that separates it from other thrillers like it. It's hip and cool but it also has the same artistry that made The Killing such a successful film. Keitel is great and he has a good cast to give him back up.",8,0,0,12 March 2012
Inside Man," A pretty neat Spike Lee feature
","Spike Lee has finally crafted a heist thriller that is new and fresh, plus feels intelligent. Washington gives one of his better performances in the center role, mostly due to the slick dialogue that keeps the film moving along nicely. It's the freshest heist film of its decade. A truly original movie that does not exploit clichés. Director Lee gets the pace right and does not miss one note until the ending draws near and the film goes on a bit long. Still entertaining though and brings a good return to form for Director Spike Lee in one of his better 21st century films. What a great cast on display. A treat to see the talent on the screen.",8,2,3,15 October 2011
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code's not awful, but not great.
","Dan Brown's novel has become a global hit and now Ron Howard has directed the film adaptation. The film certainly diminishes the power of the book mostly due to over length and lack of pacing. The pace is slow, given the two and a half hour length, but the subject matter is still powerful enough to give me some enjoyment out of it. Some of the fun and thrill is present from the Dan Brown novel, but not all of it, making a serviceable, if not well-executed thriller. If you can sit through the two and a half hours of controversial material, you should get decent entertainment out of this limited film. See Also: Howard's prequel Angels & Demons.",6,1,2,9 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The first Potter film is a spectacle worth seeing.
","I have watched Harry Potter and its stars grow from adolescence to adulthood. This is the beginning of the journey. And I would say that Potter got off to a good start. The Sorcerer's Stone is full of neat visuals and charming characters. Though I have never read the novel, I can tell from this adaptation that it is a pleasant read. The young actors are also excellent here, unlike most child actors who rely solely on their age in order to give them the passing grade. It is a fun, yet flawed adventure bound to please young and old alike with its magical charms and a keen sense of adventure, wonder, mystery, and of course magic.",8,0,1,23 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Charming but uneven Potter chapter.
","Director Mike Newell follows Cuaron's lead in pursuing darker tones and psychological under-currents for the newest Potter installment. It's just too bad that Newell's execution at dramatic points is not as good as Cuaron's. The acting is as good as ever with everyone in fine form especially Fiennes in a powerful part. Rowling's charming storytelling is still alive and well, but the characters have grown in this chapter. This causes more teenage hormones to come out, which plays against the dark, ominous fantasy. Newell does not combine the two well, so the two become uneven and lack balance. Newell gives a good effort, but he simply lacks the power of Cuaron's previous storytelling.",6,0,0,25 November 2011
Mystic River," Of all the Hollywood contrivity
","Mystic River was a knockout through the first third, pretty good through the next third, until turning toward an ending that has little impact. The performances are top notch, the directing is great, but the story could use some work. The twist at the end is not even close to as powerful as it should be. It is all part of movie magic, but it does not have impact here and does not support the film' bleak sense of realism. when it comes down to it, you kind of wish you had not have spent two hours watching this story unfold. Yet if you allow films to take you away and care little for the realism of stories, you should enjoy it. All I am saying is this, a bleak, realistic Boston drama like this would benefit best for realistic plot elements, rather than the contrived the film seems to negotiate for.",5,0,2,29 September 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," I was letdown by this overblown installment.
","I really liked the first Potter film and I was disappointed by the second Potter film. The thing I was let down by was the film's sheer overlength. At 161 minutes, the film is overlong and lacking the emotional sweep needed to make up for it. Director Chris Columbus uses the same techniques as his first film but this time the results appear clichéd and stale. It does not have the same powerful impact it had the first time. I enjoy watching such talented actors at work however and the filmmakers stay true to their subject matter and do not abandon the charm of J.K Rowling's now classic characters. Yet when it comes down to it, it is a disappointment and lacks the sweeping sense of freshness of the first.",5,1,1,3 September 2011
Psycho," The most potent and terrifying film of its era!
","Psycho defined a generation of filmmakers. It is a film of such power that some still worship it. The most potent movie of this time period and the scariest. It still remains one of the most effective films around. Perkins gives the best performance of his career as Bates, the villain of the century. Psycho scares us from the beginning and scares us at the end as well. It may be Hitchcock's scariest movie, if not his all-time best. The score is legendary, the filmmaking is powerful, and the acting is incredible. So many films have tried to replicate the suspense of this movie, but all have failed to match the sheer power of Hitchcock's groundbreaking horror fest.",10,0,0,27 October 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," Mulligan's triumph in cinema
","To Kill a Mockingbird was the only novel Harper Lee ever wrote and it shook the world. The film had much the same impact of the novel with good reason. Peck gives a typically excellent performance as Atticus Finch. The kids are likable in their roles and the character Dill was inspired off Harper Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote! It's personally made, definitely Mulligan's best. He does a fine job of combining 1930's Alabama life and an intense courtroom trial into one even film. Robert Duvall makes an on-screen appearance as the mysterious Boo Radley. One of the best early 60's films and a great adaptation of a great novel.",10,0,1,29 October 2011
The Bridge on the River Kwai," It is hard to argue with David Lean.
","David Lean masterfully crafts this Oscar-winning tale and it is hard to argue with this man's work. Lean's end action sequences are undeniably the best of their time and they still look just as good now. The acting is great especially Guinness in his Oscar-winning role. Everything from the bridge itself to the location filming looks and feels great. A spectacle of storytelling with blockbuster special effects and lots of smart symbolism for the film goers looking for deeper meaning. People might not like the off the wall ending, but there is no denying the talent of David Lean, Alec Guiness, William Holden, and everyone else that helped work on this magnificent production design that still looks amazing to this day.",10,0,1,10 September 2011
Stranger Than Fiction," An okay Forster picture
","I have never much been a fan of Marc Forster's films and I am not really a fan of this picture either. Stranger than fiction is a creative idea treated with a good amount of craft from the filmmakers. The performances are also well-done especially Thompson and Ferell in the unique serious role. Yet the film loses its appeal when it starts telling us how to think about the negative aspects of storytelling. It begins to tell us bad endings are for the birds and that good endings are the only endings that count. If you agree with the message and do not have any tolerance for negativity, than you will be flattered by it. Yet many artistic types will be turned off by its insistence for happy stories.",6,1,2,29 October 2011
Jaws," Jaws is the brilliant thriller that reinvented suspense
","One of the best thrillers ever made and possibly Spielberg's best, Jaws enthralled audiences in 1975 and has aged well. Jaws is about a shark, a man eating shark, a very simple topic, but it is perfectly executed. The shark itself is not shown until the very end (Spielberg intelligently uses the Hitchcock suspense technique there) and John Williams' brilliant score delivers all the scares. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss all play men heading into the waters outside of New England to catch the beast. It ranks up there with suspense thrillers such as The Exorcist and Psycho, a truly great use of suspense through music.",10,8,12,10 July 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Powerful storytelling and the best of the prequels
","So far, George Lucas's prequels to the Star Wars franchise have been duds. This on the other hand is an exquisite film with better characters than the previous installments. Lucas has a lot of climatic battle scenes and features a towering score by John Williams with heart-wrenching moments that finally completes his large, sprawling series of films. This tops the first two prequels and does what prequels should do; it sets up the first film. Though not even close to the masterpieces that are the first three Star Wars films but it still partially redeems the mixed bag that is the prequel trilogy and certainly brings in plenty of cash for Lucas.",9,4,7,25 November 2011
The Lion King," A truly beautiful Disney classic.
","The Lion King spoke to me as soon as I saw it. It spoke to me as nothing less than a majestic adventure. Beautifully done on every level; from the music by Elton John or the whole story. I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day. Even amongst films in general, this one still holds its own as a classic and I think it will remain very powerful for a long stretch of time.",9,2,2,24 July 2011
Inception," I thought it was a little too out there.
","I have never felt more against the critical and commercial spotlight than I did in Inception. I felt it was okay, not bad, but certainly not good. The plot is weighted down by brainless action scenes added by Director Nolan just to keep people watching amidst the confusion. I prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent screen writing.",5,9,13,24 July 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Guy Ritchie's update of classic mystery saga is not so great.
","Well, they have done it again. Another Sherlock Holmes update and not even a good one for that matter. I praise Robert Downey, Jr. for his charming performance as the eccentric detective, but that is probably the only thing worth seeing. The use of long, sleep-inducing action scenes is unnecessary. Guy Ritchie is marketing to a younger audience and he fails to meet the intelligent story that a Sherlock Holmes film should have. In this Holmes yarn, Sherlock uncovers a vast conspiracy set up by Occult leader (Mark Strong). Ritchie wastes little time throwing brainless action scenes at us, but does take his time to unravel aspects of the characters. Even with Downey's witty and even at times brilliant performance, the movie fails as a whole.",5,0,0,9 July 2011
The Terminal," Pretty nice, well-meaning movie
","Steven Spielberg comes off a bunch of science-fiction yarns to this romantic comedy. Acceptance is the key to this light-hearted, simple-minded film. There are countless flaws in the storytelling like what is Hanks' country, which is never mentioned. The movie itself is like a puff of cool air on a hot summer day, nice but forgettable. Yet Spielberg seems to understand that this is just fluff entertainment and unlike countless movies like this it does not take itself too seriously. That ease in storytelling and makes this piece of fluffy romantic comedy an enjoyable affair that you cannot help but get swept up in.",7,0,1,22 October 2011
The Blind Side," The Blind Side's motivational, yet no character study.
","The inspirational story of Michael Oher, the performance from Sandra Bullock, and the good camera work, so why did it not come together? I think the blame is on the screenplay. The overall portrayal of Michael Oher seems stylized in a way that never really shows the true grit or sentiment of the character. It is all so glamored up. Yet the messages of the movie still stay true and the performances are finely tuned, especially Bullock's. The racism displayed is reflective and correct. Ther are lots of things the filmmakers got right, but there are plenty they got wrong as well. The results are a serviceable portrait of a very honest and fortunate man that never adds up the way it should have.",6,7,9,23 July 2011
Paths of Glory," A masterpiece to never be forgotten.
","Paths of Glory-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick. Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham, Jim Thompson, Starring: Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, Adolphe Menjou, George Macready, Wayne Morris, Richard Anderson, Timothy Carey, Suzanne Christian, Bert Freed.Stanley Kubrick's second masterpiece after The Killing follows an insane general who sends his men on a suicide mission during WWI. When the men ultimately fail, he charges three men to represent the force and be executed for cowardice much to Douglas' disgust.This film is the first of his that directly represents his recurring theme of dehumanization. Kubrick is not making a common war film that promotes battle, but his film is less straightforward in the fact that we do not learn whether or not Kubrick is for or against war. Are Kubrick's speculations that of a warmonger or a pacifist? He never answers those questions for us, but the effect he creates is a terrifying sense of realistic horror.He shows us how much military and war takes away the thing that makes us human. The general is barely a human, but is programmed as a warmonger. He represents the loss of humanity, his very character makes us shiver because he is a character we are used to, but seeing it in a form of art develops reactions we normally would not have. This film strips away the military mentalities and reveals the soldiers and the generals as they really are. We see multiple reactions from the characters. We see acts of cruelty, cowardice, and sometimes even sadism amongst the soldiers. We also see acts of bravery and compassion amongst them. Kubrick reveals true character and the results are sometimes not quite what we might want them to be of the soldiers, which reveals our inner feelings. Our responses define the way we look at war and cowardice. Some people sit through with an iron face, some look away, some cry in pity, and some may even laugh at the sheer cowardice of the soldiers about to be executed. These reactions are often disturbing and Kubrick brings them out of us without being sadistic in violence. Kubrick knows his audience and he understands the reactions, so there are little feelings of self-pity when a sadistic reaction is provoked by a scene of cowardice or a scene of cruelty.The genius of the movie is how Kubrick gets to mechanical reactions as well as emotional reactions to his subject matter. His masterful storytelling is neither sentimental nor nihilistic but it brings out both of those feelings from us. It's because we sometimes do not know the way we should react to what is going on. We are confused by the way the film presents war with such searing honesty and symbolism.",10,0,1,11 December 2011
Carrie," Better than most horror
","Carrie-**1/2- Worthwhile- Directed by: Brian De Palma. Written by: Lawrence D. Cohen, Stephen King (novel). Starring: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, William Katt, John Travolta, P.J Soles, Priscilla Pointer.Stephen King's creative novel is turned into a high-powered De Palma thriller in this story of a high school outcast (Spacek) who learns she has telekinetic powers and finally snaps after being pushed too far by her cruel classmates and her Christian extremist mother.Carrie is a horror film by all means and succeeds pretty well as a horror film and even goes a step further by providing social insight into an alienated girl's true feelings toward society under the craziness of her mother (Laurie in a great performance). It even has Hitchcock elements in it that add to the intelligence to the experience. Yet De Palma is not the most fluid storyteller and his dramatic shift between sentimental, anti-bullying tale to bloody horror film does not gel the way it should.Also, De Palma uses a split-screen during the film's violent sequence. It's as if the carnage on the first screen is not enough for us and he wants to see more blood. He almost insults his filmmaking by saying he is not putting enough on the screen in one image but needs two to give the message of the sequence. His Hitchcock elements do not always work, simply because he does not have the same skill the master of suspense had.There is no doubt that Spacek's character represents a minority of kids out there and De Palma gives Carrie a voice amongst the growing suspense that makes a few noteworthy social points but this is a horror film that acts as a parody of Hitchcock and a new brand of feminine horror which many films would capitalize on later. King loved the adaptation and I wish I could have liked it as much as him.",6,2,4,20 September 2011
Iron Man," Mostly just more action
","Ironman sports a gifted cast, first-rate visuals, and is great fantasy. It's also action bloated, preposterous, and over the top. I have never been much a fan of the superhero genre and this installment in the Marvel saga only confirms my dislike. The action scenes get so stupid that you can barely focus without laughing. Some of the action is so preposterous that by the time the movie ends we almost start laughing. The acting is great though and the visual effects are impressive, but when it comes down to the facts; Ironman is just another Summer Blockbuster made for the purposes of money and an uncreative chapter of visual storytelling.",6,1,3,24 October 2011
Beowulf," Another performance capture from Zemeckis
","I like Robert Zemeckis as a filmmaker. Who framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump were excellent and Back to the future was creative. Yet he has become obsessed with performance capture. I think it looks rather silly, like it does not know whether it is live action or animation. After his children's' story The Polar Express, Zemeckis takes on the Dark Ages Poem Beowulf, casting Ray Winstone as the title character. Winstone acted, but his appearance is changed to make him look more buff. Incorrect portrayal of the ancient poem's story, (I guess Zemeckis was counting on no one having read the poem or understood it) and the performance capture has made strides, but still fails as a dramatic medium. I wish that Zemeckis would have chosen literacy over visuals here.",6,0,0,12 July 2011
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Wes Anderson's expertly crafted fox adventure
","I have always sticked with Wes Anderson even when his movies did not succeed. His last few films have been duds, but Fantastic Mr. Fox is nothing but a hit. The stop motion animation is excellent and sets the quirky tone for the rest of the film. Anderson and his screenwriter Noah Baumbauch throw in inside jokes and adult humor without being self-indulgent or crude. Great use of music throughout plus plenty of great voice acting especially by Schwartzman and Wes Anderson's own brother Eric. A visually successful film that is creatively and meticulously designed. A true triumph of animated filmmaking and Anderson becomes one of the few live action filmmakers to be successful in animation arts.",10,1,3,24 October 2011
Speed," An excellent action thriller
","Speed is what every non-stop action film should be like: a fast-moving and intense ride (in this case, quite literally). The film's pacing is spot on, never losing a minute of our attention as it continually accelerates faster and faster. Getting Dennis Hopper to play the madman was also spot-on, Hopper plays the role with obnoxious precision and Reeves fairs rather well against him too. The premise is genius and allows the audience to be on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Of course none of this could happen in real life, but do we care? Not really. We are just propelled onward by the intensity of both the direction and the actors paired with some incredible stunt/ action scenes.",9,1,2,9 June 2012
The Sixth Sense," Moody, atmospheric thriller with great storytelling
",The Sixth Sense is by far the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever made. Osment's chilling performance is great because it never fully convinces us of the character's moral values. His performance is so cold but so heartwarming. Director Shyamalan fills the film with a moody atmosphere and keeps us pondering about what is going to happen next as the plot twists unfold step by step. It never loses interest even when it starts asking us to be sentimental about the supernatural. A very good film full of powerful plot twists and strong performances alongside great filmmaking. Osment's breakthrough performance makes this his greatest hour.,9,0,0,5 November 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The redeeming chapter
","Not only is this the best of the Potter films, but it made me overall appreciate the films and Rowling's novels with much more appreciation. The biggest problems with the other Potter films was over-length and ineffective juxtaposition, but this chapter suffers from neither. Yates is as fast-paced as ever and he blends multiple elements together effectively. The movie is spellbinding and grabs you from the start, not wandering like its precursor and gets us pretty much on every level. The special effects are as good as always and seeing the story go full circle is a comforting event that leaves us satisfied with the saga.",8,0,1,4 February 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A satisfying conclusion.
","Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings finally comes to an end with this installment. An overwhelmingly powerful epic with soaring production values, top notch battle scenes, and the sense of adventure that made Tolkien so popular and these films so great. The climax is especially memorable amidst the whole thing's sheer power. Not since Star Wars has a Hollywood blockbuster had so powerful a following. This resembles Star Wars in many ways but it is its own technical accomplishment and I am sure Tolkien would be proud of what Jackson has crafted out of his writing. 3 hours have never passed so fast before.",9,1,2,3 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May one of the best sci-fi films be with you
","Star Wars was the movie that tickled my interest in filmmaking when I was 9. I had not seen many movies before that and this was the first film that actually showed me how powerful cinema can be. It still has the same effect on me now and on future generations too most likely. The beauty Lucas has created for us is beyond belief, the references to Greek mythology and older Sci-fi sagas are intelligent, and the bursts of comic relief here and there are calculated. The story starts with a youth (Mark Hamill) discovering his destiny to fight against the evil galactic empire with his mentor (the always excellent Alec Guiness), a princess (Carrie Fisher), and a hotshot smuggler (Harrison Ford, who provides great comic relief). Excellent, beautiful, and full of eye popping visual effects that still look great now. No film has ever left as great of an impact on me than Star Wars.",10,1,2,10 July 2011
Easy A," Smart and funny with good performances
","Though I have never been very impressed by director John Hughes, much less the Hughes parody films, I found myself engaged and even enthralled by Will Gluck's Easy A. The premise is intelligent in the fact that it takes Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter as its literary and character template. Gluck than combines this with John Hughes parody to create this original, even provocative film. The lines and dialogue are conveyed well by Stone and Bynes scores a hit as a snotty church girl with a lot of hang-ups. I was surprised to find that I had no hang-ups with this teen comedy that is actually worth seeing or even a second viewing.",8,0,2,22 November 2011
Click," Uneven atrocity of movie-making
","Click is horrible alright, more than most of Adam Sandler films. It is one of the most uneven atrocities I have ever seen. Borrowing elements from Frank Capra and Robert Zemeckis, but combined with Sandler's usual irreverence, it is honestly quite forgettable. A laugh here and there is enough to keep you watching, but Sandler has little cleverness. The film ultimately comes up empty-handed as a yarn of its own. Anyone could have thought of this screenplay and the ending is ridiculous. do yourself a favor and see a comedy with a script, not a comedy that requires a superb actor like Christopher Walken to stand behind a table and show up. Pure tasteless, like most of the Sandler collection of films.",5,1,1,1 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This is how you make a sequel!
","Just like The Godfather, they said it could not be done, but they made a sequel to Star Wars as compelling as the first. The Empire Strikes Back is darker than the original, but none of the matinée fun is lost in the process. In a sense, that makes it even more impressive than the first! In this chapter, the empire is closing in on the rebels and Luke must go learn from a mysterious Jedi named Yoda, while Han Solo and the rest of the rebels must dodge Darth Vader. The beauty of the first Star Wars is all here, the elements of destiny and fate, the terrifying scenes of Darth Vader, the powerful visuals, and the well-timed comic relief. Even with Lucas not in the directors' chair, the film is still amazing in every sense.",10,1,2,12 July 2011
Gangs of New York," One great Scorsese epic
","When Martin Scorsese directed his dream American epic about 1860's New York, I expected a masterpiece and got one. With Daniel Day-Lewis leading an outstanding cast that includes Leonardo Dicaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, and John C. Reilly, there's no going wrong. Lewis is spellbinding in the semi-central role and the epic sweep is outstanding. Scorsese normally makes films not normally associated with epics, but this time he does and the gamble pays off. Powerful, sweeping, well-acted, and directed by a great master at the peak of his always provocative form, Gangs of New York is as essential as any Martin Scorsese masterpiece.",10,2,4,27 September 2011
The Breakfast Club," Moments of silliness are offset by moments of truth
","The career of John Hughes has been marked mostly by lots of silliness and a lot of fluff. This is the most truthful and insightful film he has ever made. The Breakfast Club presents different walks of adolescent life in such a way that it respects its subject matter and is not disrespectful toward teenagers or adult authority. Hughes cares about each of his characters and presents his film in an original method. Original and insightful, with a large cult following that it deserves. The only flaws are a bit too much melodrama and some unrealistic dance scenes. Overall, a worthwhile Hughes film with a wholly original craft.",8,1,1,5 November 2011
Beetlejuice," Creative early Burton
","Tim Burton has crafted a number of clever films that have touched audiences in strange ways. His eccentric art form began in this quirky film. This is an artful piece of storytelling full of bizarre scenes and filled with typical Burton fun. Keaton gives his best performance to date here as the demon and Ryder is good in her role as a Gothic teen. Overall, Burton manges to keep a quirky and often humorous atmosphere over his picture and refuses to go mainstream with it. His original ideas are what helps the movie when it starts to grow unappealing to the audience. It's always got one more trick up it's sleeve and avoids self-indulgence for the most part.",8,1,2,29 October 2011
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Coen brother quirks
","The Coen Brothers follow up their two last crime black comedies with a more light-hearted piece. The risk pays off. The film is silly and full of eccentric characters. The film is also more period oriented than any other Coen film. It is full of convincing sets and a good amount of extras. Roger Deakins' fantastic cinematography is a highlight, using color lenses for dramatic and comedic effect was one of the smartest decisions the Coens made with this one. Clooney, along with his two co-stars dominate every scene, even when the dialogue is a bit on the uncredible side. Still a knock-out though, with lots of laughs and always entertainment value.",8,0,0,8 October 2011
