The Legend of Bagger Vance," Sometimes It Takes a Teacher
","Adversity and how we handle it. What we allow it to do to us. Does it tear us down or become the catalyst to grow. Sometimes it takes a teacher to help us see beyond our pain. Maybe Redford's style of idealized characters and situations rubs some the wrong way. Maybe anything that might force one to self examination rubs some the wrong way. In the current rapid fire comment and image approach that dominates the dumbing down culture that is so prevalent today, something reflective and introspective is a welcome relief. Best performance by Will Smith since Six Degrees of Separation. He demonstrates potential beyond his usual roles.",7,0,2,25 May 2001
Se7en," Surprising Turn.
","What seemed to be a fairly typical formulaic serial killer mystery , with the older, world weary  retiring cop, imparting his 'wiser' and jaded view of the world on a younger new comer, takes a sudden unexpected turn and becomes a brilliant original. The conversation that transpires in the car between the two main detective characters and the killer on the way to the final scene is absolutely mesmerizing. What's really fascinating is to watch Detective Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) face as he listens to John Doe explain his view of the state of the world as he realizes how much it resembles his own view as stated just the night before in the bar with his partner. Especially in regard to the apathy of the populace. Of course John Doe's solution to the problem is perverted and psychotic. John Doe is a very effective representation of twisted religious fundamentalism that sees every one that doesn't follow their particular moral code as infidels deserving of death, and carrying out their death is only doing God's work. This movie comes out of nowhere to be a piercing thought provoker. Added note: Great and fitting closing credits song 'The Heart's Filthy Lesson' by David Bowie from his much underappreciated album, Outside.",8,0,0,7 January 2002
I'm Not There," Bob Dylan's 2007th Dream
","Take all the music, everything you've heard, read, seen in documentaries about Bob and throw them in a blender and pull them out and what you get is 'I'm not there' And it's a tasty concoction of a movie that comes off like a dream of everything that's publicly known about his life. Perhaps even Bob himself dreaming about the course of his life. The more you do know about what's out there about Bob the more you'll be able to make the connections with the scenes in this beautiful montage about the poet, songwriter, and musician genius of the last 60 plus years. This is a great film about a very complicated artist who could never be pinned down as representing any one ideology or persona although he seemed to imply many. I suppose Dylan will always be the great enigma and this film only helps to perpetuate it, which is part of what makes it so successful but as we all now know there's no success like failure and failure's no success at all.",8,50,81,22 November 2007
Memento," Clever But Tedious.
","Maybe this film is, as others have stated,  trying to give us the experience of being Leonard rather than just observing him, so we end up being just as confused and frustrated as he is, for that I can give it allot of credit, I know of no other film that attempts to give you the experience of the main character in such a literal way, but this of itself does not make a great movie. Solving an involved math equation might be a better time. There has to be some character development, these characters never become interesting and the motivation of the main character for revenge seems shallow and becomes boring quickly. Everything seems to ride on weather Teddy is telling the truth or not. This is never reveled and so everything is open to speculation. Probably one of the best films ever concocted for the purpose of  discussing endlessly afterward and for multiple viewing.  A plot that you care about would help allot here. I could appreciate the cleverness of it all if the story was more of a hook.  Leonard thinks revenge will give him peace? Even though he'll never remember it? All he remembers is his life up to 'the event' but is able to remember he has short term memory loss? It seems this film is trying too hard to be something 'original' and 'creative' and comes of more like an exam puzzle and is seriously lacking a soul.",4,2,3,27 July 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Visual Finesse, Emotionally Dull
","Fair adaptation of the old legend, told with mild humor. Very stylish and well crafted scenery and ambience, too much so to be really creepy or scary. Has that signature Tim Burton look and feel to it, the dark side of the human experience told with an amusing sensibility . Like an accomplished craftsman he creates visually compelling films but this one at least, fails to captivate on an emotional level.  Still, the visual experience is well worth the ride.",8,0,0,8 August 2002
Taxi Driver," Memorable Feel Bad Film
","25 years later this film still holds up as an outstanding work for Scorsese and De Niro. The accolades have already been laid out here in abundance and are very true.  Artful, stylish direction by Scorsese and a totally convincing performance by De Niro.  The soundtrack is effective and powerful and the supporting performance by Jodie Foster is remarkable.  It can be hard to praise a film that is so good at making us feel so bad. But this films is one of the best at doing just that. Made in 1976 this film has become somewhat prophetic in it's portrayal of the lonely, isolated, misfit in our society who sincerely wants to connect but can't and eventually turns violent. John Hinkley Jr. even mentioned this movie in his explanation of his attempt to impress Jodie Foster by trying to assassinate President Reagan.   In the movie, the character Betsy,  played by Cybil Shepard, mentions a line from a Kris Kristofferson song that reminds her of the central character, Travis.  After a recent viewing of this film these lines written by another well known songwriter came to mind:'now they take him and they teach him and groom him for life, and they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill' 'he's hell bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused and his brain has been mismanaged with great skill. all he believes are his eyes and his eyes just tell him lies.' 'now who's gonna take away his licence to kill?'  And then there's the ending. The ending is definitely the weak point of this work.  As stated by another commentator it should have ended with Travis and his mock suicide with his bloody finger pointed to his head. His becoming a hero seems odd and unrealistic. The appearance of him being all better at the end comes off naive. Sort of a wrap it up quick and tidy TV ending.A poor ending to an otherwise outstanding and memorable film.",7,2,5,18 October 2001
Barry Lyndon," Stunning, Mesmerizing and Not Without Some Good Laughs.
","Barry Lyndon is as great a film as so many say it is. It truly does transport one to another place and time with a sense of authenticity. I too was completely taken in with Barry's story and the eloquent way in which Kubrick presented it and allowed it to unfold. It's remarkable how time slips by unnoticeably while watching this film despite its 3 hour length and deliberate slow pace. What also struck me about it which I've not seen others comment on is the sense of humor that this film evokes about many of Barry's fortunes and ironic twists that it takes. I feel it evident in everything from the opening and ending statements displayed on the screen to the dry droll of the narrators voice along side some pretty comical situations Barry finds himself in. The dueling scenes, the style in which battles were fought, the narrator explaining how Barry's lonely German Frau took many passing lovers into her cabin during the course of the war as he rides off into the misty morning after their romantic liaison. The base human desires, not so noble emotions and flaws that arise in the characters often bring a wry smile to the proceedings. This sense is especially strong in the first half, after the intermission when things become quite dire for Barry I felt less of this comical undercurrent or only in a much darker shade. Whether one senses an undercurrent humor to all of this or not, it is a stunning memorable film and easily one of the top 100 of all time.",10,5,8,28 September 2005
Edward Scissorhands," This is As Close As It Gets To Perfection!
","This is the most original take on the Frankenstein theme that I know of and for me is Tim Burton's Masterpiece. This is one of those rare films where everything comes together and works on all levels.  Everyone of the characters from Edward, the Avon lady and her family down to the neighborhood busybodies and eccentrics are played to perfection and the essence of suburban America is captured in a comical, surreal , yet accurate way. Edward's outward appearance is a masterpiece in itself. The way his dark, bizarre, freakish, yet innocent look contrasts with the pristine, pastel conformity of the homogenized world he finds himself in. Alan Arkin is at the top of his form with that low eyed, deadpan style of his as the well meaning but oblivious head of the household. This film has that very effective trademark visual and sound quality of Burton's and it really works on an emotional level as well which is what usually is lacking in his other efforts. We really begin to care for Edward the oddity with a heart of gold who's inner beauty is at odds with his outward appearance. His gentle trusting heart and  innocence that make him so appealing ends up being what gets him in trouble with the world at large and then of course his uniqueness becomes their source of resentment and rejection of him.  This speaks to that phenomenon in life where the masses are at first fascinated by someone new and different with an interesting talent and then equally relishing their downfall and demise if they should somehow trip up along the way. The media in particular loves to exploit these two phases of well known figures lives but why wouldn't they when it sells so big? The real beauty here is how Edward reaches the teenage daughter Kim and teachers her about true friendship and caring. In the end, when he has been banished from the world he still carries on in his separate reality creating a secret life of beauty and adhering to his gentle ways. He seems to evoke a higher level of understanding. Hence his home is located high above the neighborhood below where he watches over their existence. This modern Fairy Tale became an instant classic and is among the best from any era. Underneath the folly of the this story, allot is being said about human nature and the motivations behind peoples actions. It's what makes it a great story, it can be enjoyed as just a quirky, amusing tale or something much deeper.",10,1,2,17 August 2002
Being John Malkovich," Imaginative, but falls slightly flat.
","Imaginative and creative, but takes on so much it only skims the surface of the issues raised. Leaving it a bit flat in the end. People desperate to spend 15 minutes in the consciousness of someone famous rather than endure their own assumingly bland existence, speaks volumes about lack of self knowledge and development. Just as desperate to escape a natural part of life: death and the mystery that it holds. Out of fear these people seem to be denying themselves the ultimate portal trip. The movie is more thought provoking than funny and I give it 7/10 for that. It pulls off some original scenes as well. I can't remember ever seeing anything like the run through Malkovich's subconscious. Well done.",6,0,1,20 June 2000
Legends of the Fall," Is this film serious?
","One of the worst cases of Hollywood slop I've ever encountered! You call this screen writing? I kept waiting for some meaningful dialog to begin and oh yeah, a plot too, unfortunately they never showed up. I'm sorry but beautiful cinematography and sweeping waves of orchestral strings with some heartthrob actor walking through his part does not make a good film. What does, is a STORY and characters we care about, interesting dialog, character development, basic stuff really, unfortunately this one opted for the cinematography and strings and man it's nauseating. You'd have to add a zero to your rating system to include this film. One redeeming quality is it's one of those movies that is so bad you can have a good time making fun of it as you watch.",1,29,61,28 June 1999
The Elephant Man," Cuts Deep
","There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!",10,168,182,21 July 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Speechless
","Somebody said 'writing about music is like dancing about architecture'. That seems to fit here. Words fall short. This movie is an experience in a fantastical, dreamlike, circus of the subconscious and you just have to go there and do it. Some will have a pleasant, magical trip and others will be disturbed. You take your chances.",10,0,1,30 June 2001
Big Fish," Emotional Truth
","The important truths of one's life are revealed in how they embellish the facts, maybe not the dry hard truth but certainly the more profound emotional truth. That's what Will (Billy Crudup) comes to realize in the last days of his dying, eccentric, story telling father, a man he feels he's never gotten to know because he believes that his father's tall tales are an annoying diversion that prevent anyone from knowing the real man. What he comes to learn is exactly the opposite, which is that his father with his amusing yarns has been telling the world volumes more about himself and the real truth of his vision than any fact sheet could hope to reveal. In essence he's come closer to baring the inner dreams of his soul than most men do, no matter how 'honest' they might attempt to be.This is a Tim Burton masterpiece and a gem in storytelling in itself. Of course the trademark Burton visuals are here and never used to better effect and have never been more appealing. This one stands high right next to 'Scissorhands' and 'Nightmare' as a film that will mark Burton's place in film history. This one's a bona fide 10. If you find a good fish story told well brings a wry smile to your face then by all means don't let this one get away.",10,2,3,17 February 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Unforgettable!
","In 1971 A Clockwork Orange was shocking, strange, original, stylish, disturbing, poignant, darkly humorous, controversial, beautifully filmed, ingeniously scored, and an unforgettable experience. In 2002 it still is!!! Without a doubt one of the top 100 films of the century. One that you can chew on for a long time. Allot to ponder regarding how to deal with the violent deviants of society. A must see for any true lover of film.",10,0,0,24 August 2002
The Red Violin," Object of Desire
","A violin will transport you through time as it's fortune is played out over 4 hundred years in this totally captivating and intriguing story. It's one of the best spun tales on film in recent times. A rare film of beauty, emotion and quiet humor. It's not often that a film succeeds and satisfies on so many levels as this. The richness of life is built on it's simple twists of fate and this film opens the door on the secrets held within an exquisite instrument known as the Red Violin. Don't miss out!",10,1,1,5 July 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Classic, Masterful, Horror
","In an age of over the top visual and sound effects it's a real treat to look back on this one for an example of a horror flick built around great story telling, excellent direction and attention to detail, where implied horror is much more powerful than anything that could be shown on the screen.  An expecting mother is one of the most vulnerable states of the human condition already filled with worries, doubts and insecurities and this film plays on that to the hilt.  The dream, drugged scenes leading up to the encounter with Satan himself are an excellent depiction of the subconscious mind and this movie itself has a way of slowly seeping into the subconscious and getting under the skin. This one uses the technique of beginning in the most common and pleasant of situations and then slowly descending into a paranoid nightmare as well as it has ever been done. John Cassavetes  does one of the best husbands as jerk roles that you'll see. Everyone in the film is excellent in their roles, Ruth Gordon almost steals the show and Mia Farrow's delivery is perfect at conveying her emotional state with the inflections of her voice in the delivery of every line. This is a must see film and well worth a revisit if it's been some time since you've seen it. One of Polanski's very best with a nod of course to the obvious Hitchcock influence.",10,3,5,27 March 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Lush and Sensual
","This one really nails it.  Lush, sensual, sexy\gory, beautiful and creepy. With just the right touch of humor to keep it in perspective. Tom Waits as Renfield gone bonkers is great comic relief.  Nosferatu of 1922 or Werner Herzog's version of 1979 are also very good but they've got nothing on this one. It stands well with them and is a must for any Vampire story lover. This one pulls of Dracula's story in high style!  One of Coppola's Best works.",10,122,198,14 January 2002
Blow," Solid
","Solid acting and storytelling. Done without moralizing or judgement. The character of George Jung is laid out with his charm, talents and faults and lets you draw the conclusions.  It also does not glamorize the drug world. Everything good in George Jung's life is eventually destroyed by his addictive lifestyle. He ends up a somewhat broken and lonely prison inmate.If you can, see this film on DVD.  The extra features are revealing. Including an interview with the real life George Jung and interviews of the supporting cast (done in character) about they're thoughts and impressions of George Jung. They are hilarious.",7,0,0,24 September 2001
Sweet and Lowdown," Well, there's this gypsy in France.....
","The second best guitar player in the world in the 30's comes to life through the vivid imagination of Woody Allen. Sean Penn and Samantha Morton give highly entertaining performances in this documentary spoof that's on par with Woody's masterpiece Zelig. With his guitar Emmet Ray could make people cry, unfortunately he did much the same with his life, as well as anger, frustrate, appall, amuse and astound. Talent knows no boundaries when it comes to personality. All of the supporting cast is right on the mark including famous director John Waters's small role. Woody's a master of invention in his storytelling and he's got it all working here including interview cutaways by music historians that make it even more of a hoot and has you forgetting at times that the whole thing is a ruse. A unique gem from Woody Allen and a homage to the music that he loves!",8,0,0,6 September 2000
Munich," Revenge As Boredom
","Did it really take 2 hours 45 minutes of watching angered Jews plan and execute murders of their perceived Palestinian enemies to tell a story about the cost of the endless suffering and bloodshed that constant attack and revenge, attack and revenge, brings to our world? Gandhi but it simply enough when he said: 'an eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.' This well directed, well acted film still manages to be quite boring, tedious and predictable. The ending is really watered down and weak, the message would have been so much more powerful and devastating if Avner and his young family would have been murdered along with him and thus driving home what the real cost of the constant game of violence and revenge leads too. A film with a thought provoking message about revenge but never really embraces an alternative, it's overly long and misses its chance to really be daring. This could have been a very interesting exploration of the dichotomy between forgiving and seeking vengeance. It is not and doesn't come close to Spielberg's best work.",5,0,5,22 July 2006
