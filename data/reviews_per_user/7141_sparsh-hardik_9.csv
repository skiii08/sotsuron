Skyfall," Just Perfect !!!
","After I watched the 'Skyfall' first time few years ago, I totally forgot what happened in the movie. But I remember just a one dialogue, when Bond shaves with a cut throat razor, 'l like to do some things the old fashioned way.' Now that I re-watched it, I love how beautifully the theme of 'old vs new' is played entirely in the movie.But there is a little irony. Bond is comparatively younger than the villain, who was also an ex-MI6 operative. An old villain acts as a cyberterrorist and uses advanced technologies. On the other hand, a young Bond tries to stick with the traditional techniques and methods. There is a funny scene, where Bond shows a tiny radio transmitter and tells the villain, 'It's the latest thing from Q-Branch. It's called a radio.' He likes to identify the gadget as an old invention, no matter how advanced it is.Bond likes to drive an old car because the latest company cars come with the trackers. In the third act, M asks 'where are we going?' Bond literally replies, 'back in time. Somewhere we'll have the advantage.' In his old childhood house 'Skyfall', a housekeeper offers him a knife because there are no firearms but an old rifle. The housekeeper says, 'but if all else fails, sometimes the old ways are the best.' That knife results into the death of the villain. I also watched the 'Spectre' right after it, but the 'Spectre' lacks such fineness.",10,3,6,20 August 2019
Lion," Heart wrenching
","A really very nice take on biopics. It is like two or three films with different flavour are joined very nicely. the first 50 minutes are well directed. One can watch and understand it without dialogue. A visually strong part.
The part where Dev Patel and Rooney Mara starts romance (with Rahman's URVASHI URVASHI in background) is lovely.
Theme is strong and so many can connect with that with their perspective. The montages of switching shots between two different countries, India and Tasmania, are really good and moving. The one scene with google earth montages is also powerful.
Cinema as a medium is brilliantly used in this real life story.
applaus for internet. üíêüíêüíùüíùüíï
(Lion is a story about a boy who is lost, came very far from home and then been adopted by a family in Tasmania. After he grew up, he starts to find the home.)",10,1,2,20 August 2019
Get Out," redefining the horror
","Directed by Jordan Peele...

Simply genius !!
'Fire, it's reflection of our own mortality. We're born, we breathe, and we die. Even the sun will die someday. But we are divine. We are the gods trapped in cocoons.'
No, film is not about life and fire, It's kind of reverse of MATRIX !!)",10,1,8,20 August 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Magical and Realistic simultaneously! This is perfect!
","This is a movie which i have READ (as a screenplay) before i watch. Even a movie about DEATH can be so beautiful !! But i like to think about it way around, It is more about LIFE.
the same screenplay writer, Eric Roth also wrote FOREST GUMP. One can see similarity between both characters who are driven by life's force with so less choice available for them.",10,0,0,20 August 2019
The Dark Knight," escalation !
","BATMAN
Gotham will return to normal.
GORDON
Will it? What about escalation?
BATMAN
Escalation?
GORDON
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics... we start wearing kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds...
///
This last dialogue of 'Batman Begins' sums-up the nature of its sequel 'Dark Knight'. Everything is escalating in Dark Knight. Every time Batman does something, Joker raises the stake higher. Batman unwillingly inspires hokey pad wearing vigilantes; Joker starts to kill them and threatens to kill more if Batman will not turn himself in. Batman fights him, so Joker put Batman in the dilemma, where he could save either Rachel or Harvey. He orchestrates even larger dilemma for innocent citizens and criminals. But with excellent reasoning, Joker fails to 'prove a point'.",10,0,2,24 August 2019
The Last Samurai," Enjoyable and thoughtful
","There is an argument, that the ways generally Samurais are portrayed in the pop-culture is not truly accurate and many of them were corrupt. They resisted the modernization of Japan in 19th century under the Emperor Meiji, because it was going to take away their privileges as a warrior class. But Meiji's step (somewhat reluctant) was a visionary one and he brought the modern ideas into his country and started the industrialization, so that the Europeans couldn't get opportunity to fully dominate the land of a rising Sun. And till now, it is appreciated how Japan formed a perfect balance between the modern state and a state which values it's cultural identity. That's where India failed, due to lack of centralization of political power in 19th century.This epic scale movie doesn't address that complex situation of that era; however it communicates the idea of the importance of one's own culture and its values. There is something beautiful about the previous generation war movies. They feel more real than today's movies made with the excessive use of visual effects.",10,3,17,20 August 2019
The Wrestler," The best from Darren Aronofsky
","' I used to try to forget about you. I used to try to pretend that you didn't exist, but I can't. You're my girl. You're my little girl. And now, I'm an old broken down piece of meat... and I'm alone. And I deserve to be all alone. I just don't want you to hate me.'This story... I'm in deeply love with this...‚ù§ Hero is totally broken and alone.
I remember Khalil Gibran, 'And is not the flute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?'
He is the flute which was hurt by knives.",10,0,0,20 August 2019
Marriage Story," Excellent drama!
","Excellent drama! I found few similarities with the dearest 'Annie Hall' by Woody Allen, which I later confirmed by googling. The conflict between NY and LA life-style works as a catalyst to develop the character arches for both the main leads in Marriage Story, which comes in Annie Hall's third act. One may question: where is the originality in today's referential storytelling? I think it is in subtlety rather that structures and formats.",10,6,8,25 January 2020
Heat," story with profound sense and work of beauty
","It's not a secret, that Michael Mann's 'Heat' (1995) and other movies were a great influence on Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' (2008). The 'Heat' is a long movie that requires patience. One can call it a telephoto movie, as the frames are wide open and the background is compressed. That's how Michael Mann made sure that viewers grasp the city as a character too. Personally, I love the telephoto movies; they give you the liberty to absorb more details from the environment of the scenes, my favorite one is 'Foxcatcher' (2014), shot on 35mm/16:9 frame.Apart from the visual style and bluish impression, there are some obvious parallels between the 'Heat' and 'The Dark Knight'; the famous bank robbery scene and a face to face confrontation of the hero and villain, where for the few moments they are like the two different faces of a same coin. The dialogue in the 'Heat' is;HANNA - 'My life's a disaster zone.  I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage. My third. Because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.'NEIL - 'A guy told me one time: Don't get attached to anything you can't walk out on in 30 seconds, if you feel the heat around the corner. So if you're chasing me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a family?'Here, a skilled and sophisticated criminal Neil sets a rule of no personal attachments, while Lieutenant Hanna is trapped between his family life and the police life. One can draw its parallel with 'The Dark Knight', where Batman seeks an alternative of himself, so that he can also have a personal life he has been sacrificing for the Gotham.",9,1,1,20 August 2019
