Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, clean action-packed fun!
","If you're looking for deep philosophical meaning, see an old Bergman or a Fellini film.  However, if you want a good, old-fashioned, Saturday-morning serial with thrills, chills, spills, and a galaxy of interesting and entertaining creatures, see the Phantom Menace.  The Star Wars saga was, is, and I hope always will be comic book science fiction rendered with state-of the-art cinematic technology.  Congratulations, George, on bringing us another wonderful installment in the trilogy of trilogies.  Make the jump to light speed, and bring on Episode II.",9,0,1,19 May 1999
