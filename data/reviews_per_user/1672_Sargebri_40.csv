Saturday Night Fever," More Than a Disco Movie
","Saturday Night Fever is more than just a disco movie.  This film is a great coming of age story.  As the movie rolls along, Tony begins to realize there is more to life than just hanging out with his buddies and screwing every female in site.  At the end you can see this when he refuses his prize in the dance contest.  This film also covers the breakup of a family.  When Tony's brother decides to leave the priesthood, this already puts more strain on the tenuous relationship between all the members of his family, especially his father.",Null,4,5,23 March 2003
Scarface," The American Dream Perverted
","This is a very great film.  It pretty much is about Tony Montana trying to achieve the American dream.  However, where most people do it in an honest way, Montana achieves his through drugs and murder.  The only version of this film that I have seen is the television version that is heavily censored, for obvious reasons.  But, you still can see that this is an important commentary on the greed is good 80's and that it is a great film. No wonder Mario Van Peebles used scenes from this film in his classic New Jack City.Now say it all together 'SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!'",Null,0,1,2 July 2003
Ghost," A Great Film
","This is one film that works on so many different levels.  First and foremost it is a great love story that shows how even though someone dies, love for a person never dies.  It manages to do this without becoming sappy.  It also is a great thriller as you see Sam as he tries to save Molly from Willie and Carl while he is in his ghostly state.  Many of those scenes scenes kept me on the edge of my seat.  But most of all the comic moments with Whoopi Goldberg were what helped make this film an all around entertainment.  She provided some much needed humor into what is pretty much a serious film and won a well deserved Academy Award for her performance.  This film is definitely an all time classic.",Null,6,9,6 July 2003
Friday Night Lights," One of the Greatest Sports Films Ever
","This is one of the greatest sports films to ever be put on celluloid. The acting as well as the way it was shot helped to make this film a classic. Billy Bob Thornton shows once again why he is one of the finest actors today. He didn't play the stereotypical tough guy coach. Instead, he played a coach who was not only tough but compassionate. You could see this in the way that he cared for each and every player on the team. The other factor that made this film enjoyable was its almost documentary style approach to the story. It almost looked as if you were looking at an NFL Films documentary profiling the team's season. However, the biggest plus for this film was the way it portrayed Texas' obsession with high school football. The old saying that describes that is that there are only two seasons in Texas, football and spring football. Also, the football scenes really keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. You almost can feel each blow as the players sacrifice themselves for their school and their sport. This truly is a remarkable film.",Null,0,2,23 October 2004
Citizen Kane," Could Fit Today
","I finally had a chance to look at this film and I have to say that it was all I expected and more. The things that struck me about it was that there were two main messages. One was the fact that its main message was that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Kane turned out to be like most men who achieve power and when they do they aren't satisfied with the power they get. It also showed how Kane would step over any and anyone to get that power. Also, this film showed how the media tries to manipulate people and this is especially true in today's world of 24 hour news and the internet. Even though Kane was said to have been based on William Randolph Hearst, the person of Kane could also fit media barons like Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch, especially Murdoch. Murdoch is definitely someone in the Kane mold and if anyone had a chance to make a film like this today, they probably would use him for the model. This film is definitely the classic that I have heard about.",Null,2,4,25 July 2004
Stripes," Bill Murray's Breakout
","This was probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Bill Murray is perfect as the the total goof off and Harold Ramis is excellent as his buddy Russell that gets roped into John's crazy idea to join the army. To me, this was two separate films. The first part showed how the boys managed to make it through boot camp despite being a platoon of screw ups, the funniest of which is John Candy in a great performance as the fat, but lovable Ox. The second part showed how they wound up being heroes as they take on the Soviets. Another great However, viewing this is somewhat sad due to the fact that Warren Oates died after making this. This film is definitely a screwball classic.",Null,1,2,6 November 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Overrated
","When I first saw this movie, I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about. To me this was just a rather ordinary western featuring two of the greatest actors of their time in Redford and Newman as well as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers in Katherine Ross. However, this film fell rather flat. The only scenes that stuck out from my mind were the bicycle scene, the chases and, my favorite, the fight scene between Butch and Harvey Logan.I guess that you had to see it when it first was released to fully appreciate it for what it was. Remember, at the time that this film was released, America was just ending the most turbulent decade in its history since the Civil War. Events such as the assassinations of the Kennedy's and Martin Luther King, Woodstock, civil unrest and the election of a controversial president in Richard Nixon all made America seek an escape from all the turmoil that was going on and this film seemed to provide it. This film harkened back to a simpler time in American history and it touched a cord with the country. Also, the underlying theme of change could be seen as a parallel for what was going on in America at the time.
This film may be a classic to most people, but in my eyes it fell flat.",Null,2,5,14 August 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Better Than the Original
","I guess I'm one of the few in here that actually enjoyed seeing this film. I think that the chemistry between all the characters is what helps makes this one of the funniest films of the year. I especially loved how Tess was made part of the plot this time, even though she only appeared in a small part of the film. Also, the thing I liked about it was that it pretty much had an indy feel to it for me. It pretty much looked like Soderberg wanted to give that look to the film as a way of almost filming it as a documentary. However, the thing that really made me enjoy this film was the fact that it had me laughing almost from beginning to end. This film works well as both a comedy and as a caper film and it really made it one of the most enjoyable experiences that I had at a theater.",Null,2,9,24 December 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Perfect Black Comedy
","This is not only one of the greatest comedies ever made, it is probably one of the greatest films ever made, period.  To take a serious subject like nuclear holocaust and turn it into something laughable was unimaginable at the time, but somehow this film made it work.  The performances by Sellers, Scott and Hayden as well as the intelligent script and wonderful direction by the late, great, Stanley Kubrick helped make this film into a classic. However, one of the best performances had to have been from Keenan Wynne as Colonel Bat Guano.  His performance in this film was sheer genius as he was looking for 'deviated preverts'.  This film will always be among my personal favorites.",Null,1,3,4 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It All Comes Together
","This is the film that pretty much answers all the questions.  One thing that I did notice is that it dealt with the theme of redemption.  Luke pretty much wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regains his humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke, but to destroy the Emperor, the man who cost Vader his soul.  I also liked the scene in the film where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also, even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy, it still has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a par with the previous films.",Null,29,49,16 November 2003
Malcolm X," The Biggest Snub in Oscar History
","This is one of the greatest epics on one of the most complex individuals of the twentieth century.  However, this was also a victim of one of the greatest snubs in Oscar history.  Despite the greatness of this film it was only nominated for two Academy Awards.  Denzel Washington, deservedly, was nominated for his performance.  However, he was beaten out by Al Pacino for his portrayal of a blind former army officer in Scent of a Woman.  But perhaps the biggest snub was suffered by Spike Lee.  Lee made the film come to life as he told Malcolm's story, but he wasn't even nominated for his work.  Perhaps it was because of his controversial statements regarding blacks in Hollywood that caused him to be snubbed.  No matter what, this film should have received at least six or seven nominations, especially for Angela Bassett and Al Freeman.",Null,9,18,5 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The True Beginning
","This film can pretty much be seen as the true beginning of the Star Wars saga.  We get to see how Anakin and Princess Amidala fell in love and married leading to the births of Luke and Leia.  We also see what could have been the origins of how the empire began with the first appearance of the emperor.  Also we see for the first time the true relationship of Anakin and Owen.  But most of all we get a glimpse of the plans for the Death Star. 
As far as the movie goes, it does move slow in the first half, especially when dealing with the love affair of Anakin and Amidala.  The only time it picks up is when we get closer to the end and witness the battle between the clones and the the Jedis.  This film was okay, but it was nothing like the original (actually second) trilogy.",Null,0,2,16 November 2003
Forrest Gump," A Great Document of the Second Half of the Century
","This film is such a great document of many events that happened during my lifetime.  Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country during the latter half of the 20th century.  He was a simple man that was thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence that many people no longer have.  However, while Forrest represented the innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality.  Jenny's character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse she suffered as a child.  We see her move from relationship to relationship and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20 years, AIDS.  This film is a very touching document of the second half of the 20th century and rightly deserves to be praised not just for the technical achievements, but for the wonderful and heartwarming story it is.",Null,3,6,5 July 2003
Grease," Great Songs, Poor Story
","I first saw this film when I was 12 and the main reason I saw it was because for a few months prior to the film being released, the radio was pretty much dominated by many of the songs in the film, especially the Olivia Newton-John/John Travolta duet 'You're the One That I Want', which went on to top the singles chart and the soundtrack went on to top the album charts as well. Unfortunately, while the album was a classic, the same can't be said of the film. If you take away the music, the film is nothing more than a typical teen-age love story. It can also be called a mild teen sex comedy as well. Travolta and Newton-John are okay as well as Stockard Channing as Rizzo and Didi Conn as Frenchy. This may have been one of the most popular films of the 70's, but it hasn't stood the test of time.",Null,1,3,7 January 2004
"I, Robot"," Good Effort From Mr. Smith.
","This film pretty much worked on a couple of levels with me. On one level it was a pretty good police thriller as Spooner is pretty much trying to solve the mystery as to why Sonny killed his creator and you pretty much are drawn into him trying to get to the bottom of it. Also, it works well as a social commentary. The underlying story is about how we have become so reliant on technology that we pretty much have become too reliant upon it. Who would have thought twenty five years ago that much of America would own computers and be hooked to the internet. The same could be said of robots. Even though they might not become as advanced as the robots in the film, we still might one day have robots in most households performing most menial tasks that we perform today. In fact, we do see robots performing a lot of tasks in many industries, especially automobile manufacturing. Unfortunately, the people in this film became too reliant on the robots and there is a danger that robots could take over a lot of jobs. All in all, this was a pretty decent film.",Null,0,0,17 July 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Great Little Caper Film for the 21st Century
","This is one all star film that doesn't fall flat on its face. It pretty much follows the plot of the original, but it has its own flavor. In fact, this is not as much a remake as it is an improvement on the original. Also, the cast seems more focused on making a good film rather than using the film as an excuse to party.As for the cast, George Clooney shows that he is a great comedic actor and displays a sly charm that he pretty much displayed on ER. Brad Pitt is perfect as his second in command and the two of them have a great chemistry. However, Don Cheadle is the one that really steals the show. He really steals the show as the electronics wizard. Ironically, he played Sammy Davis Jr. in HBO'S 'Rat Pack' biopic that came out a few years earlier and he plays pretty much the role Sammy played. Also, old hands like Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould really worked well with their younger co-stars. This is one great film.",Null,0,1,8 December 2004
Batman Begins," Great Version of the Batman's Origin
","This is probably the best of all the Batman films. What makes it so is the fact that, as it title suggests, shows the how Bruce Wayne went from being orphaned as a child, to the Dark Knight. It was also great to see them show a little bit of the relationship between young Bruce and his father. This relationship was only hinted at in the comic books, but you can see why the deaths of his parents really after their tragic murder. You also see how after his parents die how the anger builds up inside of him to the point where he almost makes a very tragic mistake that almost ends his quest before it begins.As far as the cast is concerned, Christian Bale is excellently cast as Batman. He shows the almost split personality of Bruce/Batman that is apparent in all the books. Michael Caine is also excellent as Alfred. This is the first time that you pretty much see Alfred as more than just a confidant, but as a father figure as well to young Bruce. Katie Holmes is also good as Rachel. She does a lot more than just play the damsel in distress role that other actresses in the series have. She pretty much has a great deal of spunk that hasn't been seen in all the other actresses, especially Kim Bassinger. Morgan Freeman is also great as Lucius Fox. For those of you who may not know, he is one of the more important characters in the latter day Batman stories and Freeman captures the character well in his portrayal.This is definitely the best of all the 'Batman' films.",Null,6,9,25 June 2005
The Incredibles," A Truly, Pardon the Pun, Incredible Movie
","This is one of the finest animated films I have ever seen. Not only is it a fine animated film, it is a great film period. The film obviously takes its cue from several real life super hero comic books, especially The Fantastic Four and the Justice Society of America. The Fantastic Four comparison is obvious due to the fact that Elatigirl and Violet were obviously inspired by Mr. Fantastic (aka. Reed Richards) and the Invisible Woman (aka. Sue Storm Richards) respectively. The J.S.A. influence is a little more obscure. Several years ago, DC Comics issued a mini-series that attempted to explain the demise of the Justice Society by claiming that the group was forced to disband after their loyalty to America was questioned during the 1950's. In this film, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation.",Null,129,161,13 November 2004
Hero," Great Visuals
","As another commentator said, this is one of the most visually exciting films that I have ever seen. You can pretty much see why this film was has been a cult favorite for years before finally being released in this country. The story itself has an almost 'Rashomon' like quality about it as it pretty much tells the story of how China pretty much was united. Also, even though it does have fight scenes, you never really see any blood, which gives is fine due to the fact that unlike other films that have a lot of action, this film doesn't rely on gore to get its point across. It also has a great love story that isn't too mushy, but it shows how love not only can unite two people, but it can sometimes have tragic circumstances. The only criticism that I have about the film is the fact that it can be confusing at times and if you aren't really paying attention to it you might lose track of the story. However, this is a wonderful film and I highly recommend it.",Null,0,0,4 September 2004
The Longest Day," One of the Greatest War Films of All Time
","This is one of my favorite films.  I always look at it from time to time to see how they were able to recreate one of the most important days in the history of the world.  To me, Robert Mitchum had the stand-out performance as the commander of the forces that stormed Omaha Beach that day in June 1944.  Also, the thing that made it even better was the fact that they showed all sides of the invasion, including the Germans.",Null,2,4,11 March 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Probably the Greatest Film on Boxing, Period
","This has to be one of, if not, the finest films ever done on the sport of boxing. The fight scenes are great, but its the gentler moments between Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood that help make this film what it is. However, the true glue of this film is Morgan Freeman. He definitely provides a true center as the narrator of the story. It is his gentle nature that helps make this film an all time classic. Also, this is a great story about relationships. You pretty much can see this as Frankie pretty much establishes with Maggie, the relationship that he wishes that he could have had with his own daughter. This relationship really comes to a head especially at the end.The other thing that I really liked about the film is that unlike most boxing films, it doesn't end with the big bout that sees her win the title and become champion. Instead, it uses that scene to pretty much set up the real strong part of the film. This film is definitely a great film not only on boxing, but on relationships as well.",Null,2,3,29 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Great Story About a Turbulent Time
","This is definitely one of the better docudramas that I have ever seen. For George Clooney to pretty much do a film on a something that occurred prior to his birth and do such a good job with it makes it an even more incredible work. Of course, most of the stuff I knew about Murrow's feud with McCarthy came from brief snippets that I saw on television over the years. This film really brought the story into clearer focus and really showed what a lowlife McCarthy was for stirring up the public's paranoia and the courage it took for Murrow and Fred Friendly to finally expose him for what he was. Where it really does a good job is in the fact that it pretty much follow's the same technique that All the President's Men took and told the story of McCarthy without using an actor to portray him in much the way that President's Men did. That film pretty much told the story of how Woodward and Bernstein exposed Nixon and didn't use an actor to portray him. Clooney is showing that he is more than just a good actor and that he is now truly establishing himself as one of the great directors around.",Null,1,2,24 November 2005
"Girl, Interrupted"," Cukoos Nest For the 1990's
",This is definitely one of the best films to deal with life inside a mental institution.  This was the career maker for Angelina Jolie and it solidified Wynona Ryder's career.  The person I really enjoyed in this film was Britanny Murphy as Daisy.  She was a person who had a tough exterior but after you chipped away at that shell there was really a fragile little girl underneath.  This film is definitely something I would watch again.,Null,5,5,28 April 2003
The Graduate," A Great Commentary
","This film not only is a great comedy, it is also a great commentary on moral values and the generation gap.  At the time it was released, America was in the middle of its own cultural revolution when the youth culture began to question the values of society and rebel against them.  Dustin Hoffman is perfectly cast as Benjamin, who is at first naive and then begins to question why he is being used by the much older Mrs. Robinson, brilliantly played by Anne Bancroft.  The film also can be seen as a commentary on the games people play when it comes to sex.  At the beginning of the affair, Mrs. Robinson is in control, however she loses that control when Ben meets Elaine and falls in love with her.  She then feels that the only way she can regain control of the situation is by telling her daughter about the affair.  However, Ben sees right through her games and winds up winning in the end.  This film is definitely a great commentary on one of the most turbulent eras of all time.",Null,1,2,7 January 2004
Rocky," Good, But Not Great
","This is good movie, but it is not the greatest sports film of all time. It works because it is a basic story about a guy who has been a loser all his life getting the opportunity of a lifetime to finally make something of himself. It also works as a love story between two people who basically are misfits finding each other and falling in love. The only complaint I have about it is that it is too basic a story and the characters have been seen in movies like this before. The main thing that saves it is the fact that even though Rocky doesn't win the big fight at the end, he still comes off as a winner at the end. However, the main thing that ruins this film's reputation are the endless sequels that came after it. If they had stopped at two, maybe I would accept this film as a classic.",Null,0,3,22 August 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," Still Relevant Today
","This is one of the truly great films to have ever been released in the post war era. The themes of wondering how different the world might have been if you weren't born is still a recurring theme in many films as well as television series, but this one really does it with a even greater poignancy than most that try to imitate it. However, the film really gives a great message that no matter how unimportant you feel, your life, for better or worse, touches each person that that you come in contact with. James Stewart is perfectly cast as George really show's why he is the perfect everyman in this film. Also, Donna Reed is wonderful as Mary, the love of his life. The two of them really convey the love that George and Mary felt for one another what made the relationship between the two of them special. I also loved the fact that it pretty much pulled no punches when dealing with what probably was the touchy subject of suicide. This film is truly one of the all time greats.",Null,3,6,26 December 2004
Psycho," The Original Slasher Pic
","This has got to be one of the scariest films in the history of cinema. Anthony Perkins was perfectly cast as the demented mama's boy Norman.  He was chilling as he looked like just your average person, until the mother side of his personality took over and he became, probably, the most famous serial killer in film history (at least until Hannibal Lecter came along thirty years later).  Also, this film proved that you could have a great slasher film without being overly gory.  This is definitely Hitchcock's masterpiece.",Null,1,2,10 August 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A Masterpiece
",This film is definitely one of the greatest of all time.  It has to be in order for it to win the Oscar grand slam.  Jack Nicholson is perfect as Randall McMurphy and Louise Fletcher is perfect as the bitchy Nurse Ratched and Milos Foreman did a wonderful job in his direction of this great film. This will always be one of my favorite films and viewing it will always be a great experience.,Null,2,7,17 June 2003
Jaws," Not Just a Horror Film
","When I first saw this film, I was expecting just to see the shark eat a bunch of people and get killed in the end.  What I got, however, was an enjoyable experience.  It pretty much showed what happens when ordinary people get caught in extrordinary situations.  Also, the interaction between the characters during the quiet moments really makes this film special.  Too bad that the producers tried to milk this film for all its worth with all the needless sequels to a true classic.",Null,0,1,16 April 2003
Ray," Great Look at the Genius
","This was probably one of the finest biopics in years. You get pretty much get to see Ray Charles for what he was, a man who was haunted by his demons and who almost let those demons destroy him just as his career was beginning to reach its peak. Jamie Foxx proves that he is more than just a comedian with his great dramatic performance as Ray Charles. In fact, he does such a good job with his performance that you almost forget that you are looking at an actor and you actually think you are looking at Ray Charles himself. Also, the ladies in this film put in wonderful performances as well. Kerry Robinson, Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis all turned in exceptional performances as well. They show how the women in Charles' life affected him for better and for worse. Also, the final scene in the film where he comes to terms with the demons that were haunting him for most of his life.",Null,0,1,3 November 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," A Grand Thriller
",This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema.,Null,170,247,12 July 2003
Bruce Almighty," Classic Carey
","This film shows Jim Carey at is best as one of the great physical comedians ever.  He does a fine job with this film, which perilously gets close to It's a Wonderful Life territory with its message that we all have the power within us to make things happen and the ending could almost be considered It's a Wonderful Life-like, but all in all it was a good film.  Morgan Freeman did his usual wonderful job as God and just like George Burns before him he made God seem just like a real person with his portrayal.  Also, even though I'm not a big fan of her, I thought Jennifer Aniston did a fine job in this film as well.",Null,2,5,28 May 2003
Ben-Hur," Good But Not Great
","I enjoy it whenever I look at this film.  However, this film is not the classic that everyone makes it out to be.  It is a good story but I feel that it is somewhat undermined by some poor acting.  I don't see how Charlton Heston could have beaten out James Stewart and Jack Lemmon for the Best Actor Oscar that year.  I also don't see how the film itself could have beaten out some truly worthy films such as Anatomy of a Murder and The Diary of Anne Frank.  This is a very good film but for it to be called great is somewhat of an overstatement.",Null,2,4,16 April 2003
Bull Durham," Not Only a Great Sports Film, A Great Film Period

I remember as I was watching it that it was one of the greatest experiences I had in a movie in a long time.  This film is not only a great sports film, but it is one of the great all around films I have ever seen.  This film has it all from romance to comedy to witty dialogue.  Susan Sarandon, Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins all brought Ron Shelton's script to life and the three of them displayed some of the greatest chemistry ever captured on film.  This film is a timeless classic.",Null,43,54,13 April 2003
The Producers," A Classic Farce
","This is definitely one of the greatest farces in the history of film. Of course, this could only come from the mind of one of the greatest masters of farce, Mel Brooks. The whole idea of purposely putting on a flop to make money could only come from Brooks' mind and not only that, to have the plot revolve around Adolph Hitler is still very shocking to this day. However, Brooks pulled it off and created a classic. Also, the casting of this film was sheer genius. Zero Mostel is perfect as Max and Gene Wilder as Leo was genius as well. In fact, his characterization of Leo would pretty much be his trademark for years to come. Also, Dick Shawn puts in what is perhaps his best performance since his appearance in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. He really shines as the overage hippie L.S.D.. This film is truly a classic.",Null,1,1,12 March 2006
The Matrix," Great Effects, Lousy Story
","When I first saw this film, I was knocked out by the special effect much like every other person was.  However, the story, or what passed for one, left a lot to be desired.  I never really could get into what the so-called message of this film was and I thought the actors pretty much were overwhelmed by the effects.  The first rule of doing a movie with lots of effects is to never let the story or the characters be overwhelmed by the effects and this film is definitely a good example of that.",Null,0,3,13 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An American Saga
","This is probably one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of the cinema.  However, it is more than a a science fiction film.  This film has elements from westerns, historical epics, Saturday morning serials and, due to the scenes with C3PO an R2D2, Laurel and Hardy films.  The main thing that makes this film a classic is the fact that, when it comes right down to it, this film is nothing more than a old fashioned fable that all ages can enjoy.  No wonder it has gotten the near religious standing that it has achieved over the years.  This film is definitely one of the classic films of the 1970's.",Null,0,0,14 November 2003

For the first time we see Luke as he deals with his demons, especially the fact that we do get the shock that Vader tells him that he is his father.  We also see the beginnings of Leia's and Han's love affair.  The only thing that brought it down for me was the rather dark turn the series took with this film. However, this was part of a saga and like many before it, it had to have some down spots in it.  However, that aside, it is a worthy sequel to the original.",Null,0,1,16 November 2003
All the President's Men," THE GREATEST POLITICAL THRILLER EVER!!!
","Whenever I look at this film I am always struck by it for several different reasons.  One is the fact that this is a look into the recent history of the United States.  Thirty years ago, Richard Nixon  and his shadow government was just one step away from totally destroying the two party system in this country and if it weren't for the expose' of Woodward and Bernstein American politics would be a lot different today.  Also, this is a great detective story.  The digging that WoodStein did showed that they were willing to do anything to get to the truth about what was going on.  But perhaps the thing that really made this film great was the fact that this was a true story. Too bad that it only won three Oscars (best supporting actor Jason Robards, best adapted screenplay and art direction).  This film was certainly miles ahead of what beat it out, the original Rocky.",Null,43,67,7 March 2003
The Wizard of Oz," The Greatest Non-Disney Family Film Ever
","In 1939, many classic films came out including this one.  This film proved that Disney didn't corner the market when it came to quality films for the whole family.  The message of this film is quite simple, that home is where you can find it and that running away doesn't solve your problems.  This simple message transcends the generations and that is why this film is so popular.  On a more humorous note, I'm surprised that more people haven't pointed out the numerous references to drugs (poppies, snow etc.).  No wonder a lot of people always say there is a connection between this film and one of the trippiest albums of all time, Pink Floyd's classic 'Dark Side of the Moon'.",Null,1,3,30 April 2003
