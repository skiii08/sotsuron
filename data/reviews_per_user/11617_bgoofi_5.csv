Antz," Not a 'children's Movie.'
","I was stunned to see how inappropriate this movie was for children.  It was marketed to a younger audience, and I was dismayed to watch a battle scene unfold which should have been in 'A Thin Red Line,' not the animated feature that I was viewing.  In addition, Woody Allen spent the whole film whining, another strike against a movie posing as 'children's fare.'",1,6,18,7 July 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," It is all about the story
","A man named Walt Disney once proclaimed that you have to tell a story, or you don't have a movie.  It is WONDERFUL it see the credit 'Based on Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean' scroll by.  I have seen this movie 5 times now.  It is NOT too long, as some reviewers have said.  The story is well constructed.  The casting is superb.  The locations are amazing.  There is a rumor that some of the locations used were used for `20,000 Leagues Under The Sea'.  If true, maybe it is the waters, and more movies ought to be shot there.  GO SEE IT!!",10,0,1,18 August 2003
Finding Nemo," Amazing visuals!!
","Not only did PIXAR do a superb job in capturing the undersea wonderful world of color, but the casting is excellent.  I was amazed at how well Ellen voiced Dory.  There were moments that I just sat open-mouthed at her range of emotions.However, do not dismiss ANY of the other performers.  The Casting Director knew what they were doing.  I can't wait for 'The Incredibles'!",10,1,2,31 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Desperately seeking a storyline.
","The Wachowski brothers are SO amazingly impressed with themselves and the special effects created for the movie.  They forgot to write a story to support the visuals.  I was tired of Keanu trying to act, and act the part of Superman.  Btw  THE love' scene, I only heard about it, because I slept through it.  That kind of summarizes the movie in my eyelids.",1,1,2,4 June 2003
Tarzan," Quality writing.
","Not only is the animation superb, but the storyline is distinctively well-written.  The basis of the movie is family.  We are reminded that our true family is not always biological, but the ones around us who love us for who we truly are, and care about us having the best in life.  Being ever mindful to be proud of our family, is one of the strongest statements that comes from this production.",10,0,1,7 July 1999
