Alien 3," ALIEN3
","'ALIEN 3' (1992, Fincher) boasts some stunning visuals, a memorable score, and some classic moments; unfortunately it goes back to 'ALIEN' (1979, Scott) and tries to rehash what was great about it- but it fails.After the explosive 'ALIENS' (1986, Cameron) where could this franchise actually go? It should have gotten darker and nastier and I think the filmmakers were trying that here by setting it in a prison colony (made up of isolated men who are suddenly disturbed by Sigourney Weaver's presence) but the script is too dramatic and the characters too corny for it to scare and enthral audiences like 'ALIEN'.Having a dog alien (or ox alien depending on the scene) instead of the known human alien was a missed opportunity to do something different. Ultimately it provides nothing new except walk on all fours. It's a shame.An effort that was poorly built.",5,1,2,1 March 2020
Citizen Kane," CITIZEN KANE
","It's terrific! Everyone's STILL talking about it! 'CITIZEN KANE' (1941, Welles) is about the life of fictional character Charles Foster Kane as a journalist attempts to discover the meaning of the man's last word, 'rosebud', by interviewing everyone who knew him. But did anyone really know him?I absolutely love this film. Why should I tell you why? You'll have heard it all before. I don't think this is the greatest film ever made and in that regard it's certainly overrated (and severely underrated as a result, by viewers left cold after the hype) but it's one of my favourite films because it makes me think.******SPOILERS******'CITIZEN KANE' is by no means perfect. For example, old Jed telling the journalist things he wasn't privvy to in real life is a glaringly bad error- but I suppose that might have been done on purpose. Personally I don't think it was. And the brilliantly delivered line 'Let's all go to the window' must be one of the most hilarious deliveries in cinema. And it makes me laugh!The cast are acting. Really acting. They've got their characters and they perform. There's no upstaging, no one tries toobhard, it's acting pure and simple.This 'ROSEBUD' is the great mystery of the film. No one really knew Kane, he didn't even know himself, and everyone hopes that the meaning of his dying breath will reveal all about the man. Of course the true meaning of the word is never found outa by the journalist, but we see it as significant twice.
Often people say that Kane longed for his childhood, his life before he was given away to Thatcher and brought up to be the richest man alive, and after owning so much extravagance he simply longed for his old wooden sled. That may be true on his deathbed, but it also played an important role in his downfall as a man. On his way to see his childhood possessions and, we can be sure, his Rosebud sled, he meets a young lady who soon becomes his mistress. This leads to him not being elected governor, him losing his wife and son, him becoming a joke of a news man, and him suffering the awful turmoil of her leaving him in his old age and realising that money and possessions have gotten him nowhere slowly. The first time we hear him say 'Rosebud' he is dying and sounds as though he longs for whatever it is (which we learn to be his childhood to put it simply). That second time we hear him say 'Rosebud', after his second wife leaves him, he is vengeful and clearly blames it and the rest of his childhood for the way his life turned out. In a way the word does explain everything about the man, but only to us.*SPOILER FREE*It's a great film but don't take it so seriously. Enjoy it for the satirical character study and groundbreaking exercise in filmmaking that it is.",10,1,1,1 April 2020
Alien: Resurrection," ALIEN: RESURRECTION
","'ALIEN: RESURRECTION' (1997, Jeunet) continues where 'ALIEN3' (1992, Fincher) left off...But is completely different in just about every way imaginable. This is a violent surrealist nightmare that has some really wonderful visuals, and some really bad ones too. I also question the validity of keeping Ripley in the story. I understand why she's there but the character becomes a bit of a joke in this film.I love it for its nastiness, its gore, its attempt at a new direction for the franchise but it doesn't feel like an Alien film to me. It feels like a separate, big budget entity that borrowed from the Alien series but innovatively. I do like it though and it's underrated.",7,0,1,1 March 2020
Hostel," HOSTEL
",Disbelief can only be suspended so much before you snap back into the reality of watching a film that has ran its course well before its end. If I were you I would turn it off about 20 minutes before the end because that's where it will all go downhill to heart sinking boredom and brainlessness. This film is like a roll of toilet paper. Its great until it runs out and you're left with a little cardboard tube.,2,1,4,3 November 2018
Alien," ALIEN
","'ALIEN' (1979, Scott) is a masterpiece that hasn't been surpassed by anything in 40 years. I don't know how many times I have seen this film but every time I put it on I'm hooked from beginning to end.This film has influenced horror and sci-fi in an unprecedented way. There have been countless imitations, in both big and low budget projects, in film, literature, music, tv, games (both tabletop and video) and even cartoons.Although the premise of this film wasn't exactly new it was so brilliantly executed that it's one of the greatest films ever made.",10,1,2,1 March 2020
Predator," PREDATOR
","'PREDATOR' (1987, McTiernan) is definitely no 10/10 masterpiece. The Predator itself is fabulous. I Can't fault it.But the film is no more than a tongue in cheek sci-fi action farce. It isn't genius, it's actually mind numbingly silly as a bunch of muscle-mounds, each a cliche, is hunted down in the jungle.It's the 'TOP GUN' (1986, Scott) of sci-fi/action films (however subversive it might be with the inclusion of a murderous alien) that outstays its welcome towards the end.Fun acting, heel-thumping soundtrack, great monster and an influential idea make it a must watch but it ain't a flawless classic.",3,1,9,1 March 2020
Aliens," ALIENS
","'ALIENS' (1986, Cameron) takes the 'ALIEN' (1979, Scott) recipe and adds more victims, more Aliens, more suspense, and balls to the wall action. The result is a brilliant horror/sci-fi/action film that couldn't have followed on from the magnificent 'ALIEN' any better.",10,0,0,1 March 2020
Ghostbusters," GHOSTBUSTERS
","For a long time now cinema has been haunted by legions of 'GHOSTBUSTERS' (1984, Reitman) fans, most of which lambast the sequel and do nothing but spit at the mere mention of the reboot. They love their tiresome, irritating, incoherent 'GHOSTBUSTERS' devoutly andunconditionally, and I think that's sad.For starters this is a boring film. The effects are wonderful but this film offers nothing else.Bill Murray ruins this film with his sleazy, rapey schtick and his one-liners and slouching posture make him sound and look like a half-witted doper... At no point in this film does Murray seem to care about the film and he sucks.The plot is driven by the following: private enterprise- good; slave-driven employees- should be grateful; public sector workers- idiots and snides; ghosts- need to be locked up; being abusive, pushy, creepy and loud- very attractive... And so on. These things are not funny and to think they are is juvenile.Are you scared of not being cool? Is that why you 'love' this film? A lot of this film comes off as propaganda for right-wing bigotry. Is that cool? It isn't cool. Those guys have been laughing all the way to the bank thanks to sheep thinking they're cool and it disgusts me. It's not about ghosts being busted! It's an attack on the 'left', an insult to both genders, a promotion of destruction over productivity and a celebration of laziness and luck.
Basically the only way a new GHOSTBUSTERS film would have any chance at winning the fans over is if it were made by ladbible because this film may as well have been put together by drunken fratboys. Still if they won't move on they deserve to fossilize with this dinosaur.Bill Murray is rubbish, script is awful, don't bother just for the effects because there aren't enough of them.",1,1,3,22 March 2020
Toy Story," TOY STORY
","'TOY STORY' (1995, Lasseter) is beautifully crafted and outrageously funny throughout its runtime.It pulls no punches when it comes to scripted and visual gags, is great for children and adults, and boasts 3 much loved sequels- but in my opinion it's still the best.",10,0,0,17 January 2020
The Fly," THE FLY
","'THE FLY' (1986, Cronenberg) is a great film and probably Cronenberg's best. It hits every nail on the head. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are fabulous. The makeup is incredible. The effects are exceptional. It's a powerful piece of filmmaking that doesn't need me to recommend it. But I do.",10,1,1,1 March 2020
Jaws," 'JAWS'
","'JAWS' (1975, Spielberg) is exploitative trash at its lowest, boasting poor visuals and a monster so rushed that it is deserving of deepest sympathy rather than fear. The only things holding this garbage together are a great cast, brilliant music, simplicity, and being based on a solid work of literature.This is one of those films that, sadly, got many of us into films as kids. I know that for me the voices of the performers were as important to me growing up as my own family's! But, nostalgia aside, this is also one of those films that rarely gets criticised and it should.It's a shoddy film, poorly made, and John Williams's score covers a multitude of sins, like lacquer over cheap splintering wood.I love a physical monster as much as the next sensible person, but this shark is transparent from the side, floppy-mouthed and growling (yes, growling, and I don't just mean the dinosaur sounds added over its sinking carcass; if you pay attention to a couple of scenes well enough you'll hear what at first sounds like water rushing, but is in fact a subtly placed growl, so it wasn't the ridiculous 3 & 4 that invented that) monster that needs to be put out of its misery. And when that time comes it is stupid. A shark, swimming towards a man on a sinking boat, chewing an oxygen tank like a big silver cigar, that gets blown inexplicably up into little pieces.To make things worse this did such a good job of scaring people that it made heroes of any dumb fisherman who wanted to go and murder sharks and gave false intrigue to the average holiday goer or idiot when confronted with a set of freshly torn out jaws to buy. ... much to the bewilderment of the cast and crew who had been sure the film was dreadful.I take umbrage with anyone who says Spielberg did a great job because he scared people out of water. Yeah great, let's be scared of going swimming. Let's scare our kids out of enjoying the world. Spielberg's job was to make money for Universal, which he did successfully because mugs love to rip themselves off. When I go into the sea the last thing I'm thinking about is floppy old Bruce eating his way towards me, I'm more concerned about stepping on a weaver fish and going to hospital.I also hate this idea that 'JAWS' changed cinema for the better. How exactly? 'JAWS 3D' and 'JAWS THE REVENGE' are in constant competition for worst movies ever made and aside from them there's been a glut of subpar rip-off movies from around the globe since. Yeah, great.Then there's the hilarious sequels, each just as bad as the first, all anti-shark propaganda aimed at the most vulnerable in society- the gullible, the young, and the foolish.The novel by Peter Benchley is the superior work but it's still exploitative trash. How 'JAWS' the movie captured the imaginations of millions (including me for many years) is beyond me. The only bad review I can find is from the LA Times in 1975 who took issue with it being a family film when it will be so frightening for children. That is a sound concern but 'JAWS' is worse than that, it's garbage that we're told is genius. Think for yourselves.",1,2,16,26 February 2020
Kong: Skull Island," King Kong: Skull Island, 2017
","I hated this film beyond belief!Why are the monsters so huge? I know I will happily suspend my disbelief concerning the monsters, as I did for the original King Kong, but when confronted with this hugeness I have to wonder whether there's room for any more than just one of each creature! It isn't needed.One thing I did like was how bright and colourful the film is. It's a bold statement to make when most films of this period seem to be shot entirely in black. Come on, where's the colour? Where's the light?!Terrible script, there is nothing original about this film! Why does it have an all-star cast? Samuel L Jackson? Brie Larson? Tom Hiddleston? JOHN GOODMAN? Why?! They're hardly used.I will not be watching this film again.Watch King Kong, 1933, Son of Kong, 1933, King Kong vs Godzilla, 1962, King Kong Escapes, 1967, and King Kong, 2005.",1,1,3,2 August 2017
Godzilla," Godzilla 2014
","I found it hard to know what was going on in this film as the lighting is often dreadfully poor. We tried turning the lights off but found we were just in a dark room with lots of noise coming out of the TV.I like the Toho Godzilla films and I like Roland Emmerich's Godzilla too. I really do not like this Godzilla.First of all the monsters are all implausibly big. I get how fun is derived from giant monsters, but not only do these monsters have their heads in the clouds, the tone of the film is incredibly serious. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield a lot of the time. Seriousness and skyscraper-sized monsters don't go well together.Dialogue is poor, characterisation is tired and off the hook, poorly designed and executed monsters all round, witless, dead-serious, and with no character whatsoever, this is not a film for me.What it has done is provoke me into buying earlier Toho Godzilla films to be watched on my Region 1 player. There are some great ones to check out if you haven't already, such asGodzilla vs The Smog Monster, Son of Godzilla (BRILLIANT MONSTER EFFECTS!!!), Godzilla vs Gigan; Ebirah, Horror of the Deep; Return of Godzilla etc.I feel like they got me out of the coma Godzilla 2014 put me under.Also I would like to know why the film was met with rave reviews from critics? It has been treated as an art film that explores the non-exhaustive facets of society. Is this because the original Godzilla was about nuclear weapons and how terrible they are? So therefore this film must have some serious message to get across?It doesn't. If anything it seems to be for everything the original film was against.I'm tired of darkly-lit, implausible, thick-headed, dim-witted, CGI-ridden, factory-produced let-downs like this. Let it be forgotten about in time. Bryan Cranston has moved on so the rest of us should too.",1,0,2,2 August 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," THE CABIN IN THE WOODS
","'THE CABIN IN THE WOODS' (2012, Goddard) satirises the horror industry by portraying studio executives as soulless, by-the-book engineers of predictable horror cliches. They have the means to do anything imaginable and yet they stick with the tried and true and only dream of something more imaginative.The things that capture our imaginations are literally boxed up. Giant killer animals, mutants and freaks and demons, are all bewilderingly held back by the industry despite their popularity.The same old cliched characters are wheeled out religiously, only this set manage to hear the cries of despair from desperate audience members and realise they're in a plastic storyline, being killed off wholesale, their personalities unrealistic and transparent.The monsters eventually escape and flood the cold, stale, boring industry with its own blood and eventually everything is destroyed. Time for change?Very good.",9,12,18,3 September 2019
