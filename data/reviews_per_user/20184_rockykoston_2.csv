The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," This could have been skipped
","I wish I had skipped this movie but I advise all to please skip it.There is nothing in this movie (more like a serial), it just sets up for the finale. I have never seen a more cash grab than this one. The directors just proved that they only wanted money instead of making this series look great.The whole theater audience went 'WHAT!! (and a gasp)' when this movie finished, as if no one could believe what they just saw. Literally, NOTHING.What a rip-off. I am glad I watched this movie with a free ticket 2 for 1.",6,28,53,24 November 2014
Gravity," Plain and simple JUNK..
","I should have followed my instincts and avoided this movie, once i rejected it after the trailer. However, after a score of more than 8, i decided to give it a try since i like Sci-Fi/Adventure a lot. But i was so much disappointed, not only the story has NOTHING to offer but the acting lays so FLAT. So many plot holes (if u think there was ever a plot in the first place), so many clich√©s, over the top effort to show that this movie is extraordinary, all this just makes it fall right into the dumpster.As pointed by other reviews, maybe the visuals are good but frankly I prefer to see a National Geographic documentary than this trash. No way, even if someone shows you this movie for Free, DO NOT GO. So disappointed with everything in this movie.",1,15,32,5 October 2013
