The Blair Witch Project," Very eerie, disturbing, bound to give u lots of sleepless nights!
","This movie came as a surprise for me.. my boyfriend and i wanted to see a movie and i happen to come across this movie while searching the internet on upcoming releases.  I read alot of horror stories like Stephen King and Anne Rice, which are full of vampires and stories of the supernatural.  I am a huge fan of thrillers and action-adventure movies, so obviously the Blair Witch Project caught my attention immediately upon hearing some comments and reviews on it.  That was all the info i had coming into the movie and the day after seeing the reviews we were looking forward to seeing it, but just expecting it to be a typical TRYING-to-scare-you movie like Halloween H2O. Well as it turns out i was totally shocked on how emotionally involved i was throughout the movie.  The last 10 minutes just happened so quickly and ended so abruptly, i don't think i had time to digest it all until after the movie when i really had time to absorb everything.  The more i thought of what happened to those three students, the more scary and eerie it made me feel.  It seemed so real, and i could see myself in their situation.  I probably wouldn't have been so brave to have survive some many days. Even though i enjoy watching movies, i get scaried very easily and tend to get too emotionally involved in them.  I guess my problem is i keep over in my head all of the scenes which makes it more and more scary. 
This movie was definitely worth seeing.  It was brillantly acted and is an experience that will be remembered as a 'original masterpiece of horror'.",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
