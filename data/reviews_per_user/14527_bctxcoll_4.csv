The Mask," Awesome
","I watched this movie in the theatre with a group of friends in 1994.   It was hilarious then, and it is hilarious to this day.   The plot was about a banker named Stanley (Jim Carrey) discovering a mask cursed by a Norse night god of mischief, and a local crime boss Dorian discovers this mask: he wants it all to himself.",Null,0,0,11 April 2002

Spider-Man 2," suspense full
","I saw this movie 'Spider-man 2' in the theater today.   It was pretty suspenseful in certain scenes.   I was on the edge of my seat today. In this movie Peter Parker played by Toby MaGuire, is battling his ego whether or not he can continue to be 'Spider-Man'.   Other conflicts in this movie is that he is trying to maintain the friendship with Mary Jane Watson, and his reliability with his jobs, and college. Peter Parker is attending a science experiment at building for a college assignment, when the man to be called Dr. Octopus's experiment goes bad, turning him into a super villain.   Now Spiderman is the only one who can stand to up him.  Overall this is a movie well worth watching.",Null,0,0,6 July 2004
Sleepy Hollow," suspense full
","This was a pretty suspense full movie.   This movie is a lot different then the story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.   Instead of Crane (Depp) being a school teacher, he is a detective trying to solve a serial killing in a Dutch community town.   This was a great movie.",Null,0,1,8 March 2002
