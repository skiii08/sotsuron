Minority Report," Along with 'Gattaca' this is the best genre Sci-Fi movie since 'Blade Runner'
","A superb, long (possibly the biggest flaw), thought-provoking and gripping thriller from a short story by the great sci-fi visionary Philip K. Dick, this is one of the very best movies of 2002.The story does not stick close to Dick's original story but I care not as what Spielberg has achieved is truly a riveting and absorbing sci-fi thriller that like so few other modern sci-fi movies, does not rely on action for its effect but ideas. There is certainly enough action to please most people however.Tom Cruise gives a great performance in an atypical role - he is hero with deeply ingrained flaws - and has to carry the film as he is in almost every scene.The plot is excellent. The script is spare and incisive and even manages to find room for humour - kudos to the writers. Spielberg takes a few artistic risks and here unveils what is possibly his darkest film to date.A great movie, a superior companion piece to that other excellent Summer 2002 release, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. It is most heartening that films of this quality are being released during the summer months when as recently as 1998 we had to make do with trash like 'Armageddon', 'Godzilla', and 'The Avengers'. (I think that it is primarily 'The Matrix' that is responsible for the upsurge in the quality of summer blockbusters)Similar movies recommended: Total Recall, The Game, The Fugitive (1993)",8,0,0,13 June 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Mr Tarantino has finally made a mediocre movie
","This is the first Tarantino disappointment. After the brilliance of the excellent 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown', all pretty much instant classics, this seems like a backward step for the director. It seems more like the sort of movie he should have made as his first or second movie, not his fourth.The storytelling is what's at fault here. It is told in a too straightforward and simplistic style and the pacing is way off for this first part. It is full of pauses and the dialogue is only regular action movie dialogue not Tarantino dialogue, so the fans of his dialogue may wish to skip this one. I do feel that the movie could have all been fitted into one 2-½ hour film if it had tighter editing. Harvey Weinstein's advice to Tarantino not to cut anything smacks more of a money-making ploy than a way to tell the story in a more efficient way. The acting is generally good but tends to veer unpredictably between convincing and a hammy.The action is top notch however and Tarantino is on top form in his first movie as an action director, although we are definitely in over the top movie land territory towards the end!One element the movie does not lack however is style, the blending of the manga anime with the live action works well and Uma does look great in those leathers!Highlights of the movie include the Sonny Chiba segment and the very amusing scene around the council table in Tokyo that's not for the squeamish!By the way, if you are squeamish I would advise you either to skip the movie or to not eat before you see it.Overall this is Tarantino's darkest movie yet and it certainly has an oppressive atmosphere but it is certainly no classic. I am looking forward to Vol. 2 though  it can only get better.",5,0,1,4 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," A sad attempt at an action movie in the Post-Matrix era
","I borrowed the DVD of this from a friend (whom I no longer speak to) (only joking!).Among other things this movie pornographises violence (as I understand the term) for the sake of cheap thrills by showing that the human body can take so much more punishment than it actually can. There is no way that 2 people can smash into each other at 120mph, then fall 40 feet onto a beach and then stand up and then stand up and have a fight with each other for 10 minutes (unintentional laughter abounds). It sends out the wrong message to kids who might be unfortunate enough to be watching that this can happen. Hopefully, kids are more sophisticated than I think.There is no dramatic tension in this movie at all and the plot, what plot? It self-destructed 5 seconds before the movie began. The characters have the depth of cardboard, which is an insult to cardboard and many good actors, including Cruise, are wasted - Anthony Hopkins appears to be wearing a grin during his scenes that seems to just be saying 'I'm getting $1 million for saying 12 lines and being in the film 3 minutes. I love this job!'.Did I mention the unintentional laughter? This movie has it by the shed load. I kept expecting Charlie Sheen to appear during the endlessly absurd 'action' scenes and Tom Cruise tries desperately to be cool and stylish but comes off looking like a prat. I defy anyone to watch the scene where Tom walks past the burning doorway while the dove flies past and Dougray Scott says 'Run that b*stard down!' without laughing. I sure as hell did.I liked Face/Off and I generally like most of Mr Woo's other movies but this one should just be flushed down the pan - it is just a 2-hour commercial for crassness and stupidity.I gave it a 2, I would have given it a 1 except for the added entertainment value of the unintentional laughter. You deserve much better than this so don't waste your time or money. No wonder that now, only 4 years after its release it is occupying the bottom of DVD bargain bins. Recommended only for people who thought that 'Armageddon' was a good movie.",2,1,2,25 May 2004
