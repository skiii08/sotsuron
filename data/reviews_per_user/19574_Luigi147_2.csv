The Devil's Advocate," Pacino at his best
","OK, films about the devil are common place and usually not very good. However, in this intelligent film, uses much more than the horns and fiery side of hell. I'm not going to go into details about the story bur just want to mention the performances.To start with Keanu Reeves is good, but as always a little flawed, with his accent and studded look for every situation. Charlize Theron is very useful as always and it is through her that the film become genuinely scary.However, the real greatness from the film comes in the form of the magnificent Al Pacino. Having tried to watch almost all of his films (i have a few still to - Serpico etc) i can honestly say that this is his best performance ever. The whole devil thing just suits him so well - think Scarface and Godfather 2 mixed. I think they must have done something with his face because he give the most sinister looks ever known. I could write so much more but you'll just have to see it yourself...This film must be seen for Pacino's performance alone...",9,1,1,28 June 2005
The Deer Hunter," Inexplicable
","Simply one of the most harrowing, upsetting, bleakest and best films i've seen. Be prepared.If anyone says that this film isn't any good; they'd be lying.If they said this wasn't completely shattering; they'd be lying.If they said it was one of the most moving films ever made; they'd be truthing.DeNiro give an unusually hard performance and Walken is superb.It gives an insight as to just how shocking war can be.Please watch this film - it shows just how fragile human life and existence is.",9,0,0,16 May 2005
