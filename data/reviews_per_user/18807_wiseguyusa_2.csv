E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Filling a Void
","I think the biggest thing that gets overlooked in reviews of 'ET' is the role E.T. plays in the life of the family.The family has been abandoned by their husband and father.The 3 kids are very different in ages and constantly bicker. Mom is struggling to cope.Elliot is the middle child and feels alienated.E.T. is curious and somewhat rebellious . It is his curiosity that takes him further away from the mothership than the other alien botanists, which is why they are forced to leave without him. Perhaps he feels similar estrangement. Both Elliot and E.T. feel abandoned.E.T. bonds with Elliot and his family and they become united in cause to help E.T.",Null,0,0,1 June 2002
American History X," Flip Side of the Coin
","I think some of the other reviews on this page are spoilers. I have always seen AHX as a counterpart to Boys n' the Hood. I think these two stories are from directors with similar feelings but different perspectives. All of the cast give excellent performances, and it is a first rate cast. Most of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but shocking anyway. It is certainly relavant to the plot and not over done. The story bounces back between current and flashback but is not difficult to follow. It is for that reason it is difficult not to spoil.",Null,0,0,13 July 2002
