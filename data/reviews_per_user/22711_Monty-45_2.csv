The Devil's Advocate," I have 'sympathy for the devil'.
","The first time I saw this movie my reaction was: 'WOW!!'Second time: 'AWESOME!!'The story is excellent.  I normally don't like Keanu Reeves but, I thought he was the right choice to portray Kevin Lomax. All I have to say about Al Pacino - 'Oh my God.  He was absolutely outstanding.' Definitely check out 'Devil's Advocate'.",Null,0,1,18 March 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'There are some who call me...Tim?'
","I have been a fan of MONTY PYTHON for a long time & I must say that 'the Holy Grail' is one of their best movies.  My personal favorite scene is, of course, 'the Black Knight'.  I would even go so far as to say 'MONTY PYTHON & THE HOLY GRAIL' is a classic movie that deserves to be re-released in theaters.",Null,0,0,16 March 1999
