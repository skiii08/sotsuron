Requiem for a Dream," Not worth the rating
","I rented Requiem because of its high rating on the indie list.  I agreed with most of the rankings so thought I should give Requiem a chance (have passed it up a number of times at the video store).  I have to say . . . I felt that it wasn't quite worth the rating that it received.  I do agree that the acting was good, but I think even Jennifer Connelly did better in Beautiful Mind.  Just my opinion.",6,1,2,13 April 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Way better than expected!
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie but walked out of the theater commenting that this was probably the best movie I've seen yet this year and now that I've thought more about it, it is.  I will even go as far as to rank it up there with the LOTR movies, which is saying a lot.  I still think the LOTR movies are at the top but Pirates was at least in the same league.Jack Sparrow couldn't have been casted any better, Orlando Bloom continues to prove himself, Geoffrey Rush was excellent as always and the newcomer, Keira Knightley (who is a dead ringer for but acts a lot better than Natalie Portman), was refreshing.The writing was superb, the effects were top notch and I gave it a 9/10. Excellent!",8,0,0,12 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Leaves you wanting more!
","I loved the first installment and was not disappointed with the second, although was a little frustrated with the 'to be concluded' at the end.  I felt that they could have just ended it where they did and everyone would understand.  I also didn't like the scene where Neo brought Trinity back to life, but that's just my opinion.  Just seemed a little cheesy to me.  The rest was excellent and I loved the little twist toward the end. Definitely left you thinking which makes a movie for me personally.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
The Matrix," An original!
","It's not the acting that makes this movie good (obviously) but the concept itself.  Definitely an original.  The movie puts you in your head and really makes you think.In addition, the effects are awesome and have set a standard.  Great movie when you're in the mood for more action, less reality, which we all need at one point or another.LOVED IT!",8,0,1,12 April 2003
