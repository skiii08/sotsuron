Casablanca," The 2nd Best movie of all time (Gone With the Wind #1)
",The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 was because I only give one 10 vote & I gave that to 'Gone With the Wind'. This was an excellent movie with a terrific cast & excellent acting by all.,9,0,0,2 December 1998
Psycho," One of Hitchcock's Best
",The first time I saw it I was on the edge of my seat through over half the movie. An excellent B/W movie that uses music & suggestion to let your mind complete the scenes.,9,5,9,2 December 1998
