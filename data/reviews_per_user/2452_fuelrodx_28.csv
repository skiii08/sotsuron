Skyfall," Again, some more Kickbutt
","Love it when they can get to a 3rd/4th movie and still deliver. Also loved Naomi Harris in this too. When you have the cast with the look, keep it! When Moneypenny shot Bond and he survives without blaming her, then has to re-test on all his field agent performance, and gets through even though he didn't pass, I wondered what was next. Aside from the resulting events, it follows an unprescribed course to the source of the problem and a further challenge.",9,2,5,23 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Refreshing
",So many negative reviews on here. I can only assume that many had their expectations too high. I never go to a movie expecting too much so that I have a chance to enjoy it - especially a superhero movie. Captain Marvel was refreshing for me because it wasn't the uppity superhero persona. Brie's part on here came across as a normal girl-next-door type. How refreshing! I like Samuel Jackson's Fury and the Skrull character who did a great job as well. There were many humorous moments which lightened the whole thing. That's what I call entertainment.,8,2,8,21 November 2019
Passengers," Not exactly gripping
","Surprised at the abundance of great reviews here. There's a reason I didn't buy the DVD, There's not much to this film. So the guy opens her hibernation module early and has to deal with her outrage. Ok, anything else? I got bored. I was hoping for some real goings-on, but nothing came.",5,0,4,23 November 2019
Aquaman," This is not an easy movie to make
","I think Momosa was good for the part. There were some holes in this though. How do they zip thru the water without fins? There was a lot of that going on. Nevertheless it wasn't badly done on the other points in the screenplay. I thought it had a decent plot and I understand they have to show Aqua's origin at the same time. Sometimes I get antsy thru those parts. Good CGI and costumes, etc.",6,0,0,22 November 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," Better than the others
",I give this flick a higher rating than the other Resident Evils. I've watched them all but I like the setting and the other characters in this cut. This one involved birds as well so it placed more pressure on all the characters. I liked how they used satellite transmission to control her but had to have keep in line of sight.,7,1,1,15 January 2020
Ready Player One," Virtual Gaming
",Spielberg did a great job and my rating would be higher except the script seemed to drag in a few places. I think a lot of thought and little details were there that helped the whole of it. But it was a kick and you could call it a 'fun' movie.,8,0,0,21 November 2019
The Revenant," Cinematography isn't everything
","A simple fight for life. After awhile, the same ol thing, same colors, same effect, gets boring. You can have good camera shots but that doesn't give the movie content and personal delivery. You need something more than a fight for life with the same dreary backdrop. It's almost like watching a one-room drama",5,2,4,23 November 2019
Quantum of Solace," Off the train
","We were waiting for something really good after Casino Royale cause we were excited, ok? Then it all went under and we're wondering what happened. Please don't ruin my favorite Bond - we finally got a really hopeful icon here. He had a good co star (Olga Kurylenko) but he lost out a little on a plot that didn't contain enough in it to make the movie as gripping as it needed to be.",4,0,2,23 November 2019
A Quiet Place," How do you make a film like this good?
","Really disappointed. They tried to make it work but there just wasn't enough to work with. When I start to get bored watching, I know it's not for me. I think Emily Blunt should be more choosy when she considers films.",4,1,6,22 November 2019
Kick-Ass," Better than expected
","Like most, I was skeptical with these young spoof movies, but once Hitgirl shows up I'm thinking 'whoa she's an assassin!' So then the movie becomes more interesting. And Big Daddy (Cage) cracked me up with his Adam West voicing with me having watched the old Batman when I was a youngster. It just got more fun from there. Usually if people use a little more thought to the small things it helps to dress up the script. Good work.",9,0,0,27 November 2019
Ex Machina," Well Done AI Movie
","Alicia Vikander nailed this one. You're wondering as it progresses where it's going to actually go. If you look closely st Vikander's expressions and movements, she's playing perfectly what the directors sought to reveal - what really seems machine-like mannerisms, though suttle. I loved that. nevertheleaa as it comes to the end it is revealed what the other robots are: just robots, not the kind of AI that Ava is. Anyway, not to reveal the end here. This was a good piece of work. For those who haven't seen it, there is a little nudity near the end.",9,2,2,19 April 2020
Transformers," Impressive in the day
","When I first saw it - even though it is geared for kids i could see it was geared for adults as well. Fun for all. Michael Bay got some scathing reviews from people who expected something else, but I saw remarkable CGI and greater potential and enough humor weaved into something that kids could watch. When I went to see it, they told me it was sold out. So I saw it later. Michael Bay is very good at what he does - he knows how to make a 'fun' movie.",7,0,0,23 November 2019
Elysium," Not perfect but interesting
","As a sci fi adventurer, I always love the high-tech, forward looking genre's that have good acting. My fav in this one is Jodie Foster. I thought she did her part quite well. Matt Damon always holds his own. The front end of the movie was lacking, but once it gets underway with Kruger making the chase, it gets better. I agree with another poster that the CGI was done well and that ceratinely helps.",7,0,2,21 December 2019
Avatar," Landmark Film
","I have to admit that this was the One Film that I went in expecting alot. I usually don't do that, but firstly, it's a James Cameron movie, and two, it was the new tech at that time. So something had to hit home. It turned out to have good acting and a completely new setting for the story. CGI was exceptional and the story worked out. I like the end where he finally caught the predator bird - that was a lead to the finale.",9,2,3,21 November 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bay outdid himself
",This was a cut above. It was a kicker when it comes to action. This is the one that Spielberg went and told Bay that this is the best he'd ever done. Quite a compliment. This one bring in some new characters and it moves quite well from scene to scene. Jon Turturro was great in this one as the first one. Th ending is all out ruckus but I liked all the leading up to it.,8,3,5,23 November 2019
Joker," Good actor, lousy movie.
","I know everyone wants to give a good actor kudos. I get that. The movie was drab. I got sick of watching it. Yes, it shows how a disturbed person can regress, but it moves slowly and loses its grip. For those in the psychological thriller genre it may have value.",4,6,14,10 January 2020
Arrival," More mental than anything else
","Yes, they used some good ideas here, but it's not gripping. It may appeal to those who like a mental 'figure it out' suspense theme. I always look for sc- fi action as well. Didn't get that here, that's why I can't give it a good score. If there isn't anything to throw you into the next scene but rather a 'wait-and-see' it just loses it's grip.",5,1,4,23 November 2019
Wonder Woman," What i would expect
","This isn't any easier to make than it was for Aquaman. I say that because of the type of character that has to be made interesting and avoid being too cheesy. I think Gal Gadot was fine for the part, but the way they pulled in Matt Damon's character threw me off a little bit (the time thing). Anyway, I still enjoyed the film and I bought the DVD, So happy ending.....",7,2,3,22 November 2019
Black Panther," I went in with no expectations
","Movie was produced well, but it was too slow and putting too much tribal drama in it. If this guy is a super hero then we need to get that into the picture. It was more like they were in the middle of a territorial war and that's all. Hey...we want some action, not just a few kicks with half the thrill. Some delivery here. I thought Boseman was a good actor for the job, but they hyped it beforehand and didn't deliver. You have to have a good script and quality delivery in each scene. Director, please take note.",4,1,3,22 November 2019
Tombstone," Good cowboy flick
","Like Russell, Kilmer, Elliot, Paxton, and Beign. Good lineup. For anyone who like westerns, this should fill the bill. But I didn't like the ending. They ruined it for me with the walk-in-a-line suicide mission. Can't we do better than that? What was a good story got ramrodded.",8,0,0,25 November 2019
Casino Royale," Ok...... Craig won my vote
","Love it when we get a nice kickbutt film. This my Bond, for sure. He has the look, the persona, and he's a badder Bond. I must've watched this film 8 times. Getting Mads Mikkelson on the other side of the table was a winner too. He played the right adversary for Craig's part. When Bond was poisoned, it just put a different twist in the whole game and he comes back looking as fresh as possible to continue the bets. Nicely done.",9,3,6,23 November 2019
Lucy," Winner winner chicken dinner
","Ok. I only gave it a 7, but it was a good movie. Scarlett did well and it was directed by Luc Besson. Besson did Valerian as well as many TV shows whether it was writing or directing. Nothing cheap here. But it's starts a head movie and then it goes into something far beyond reality which I wasn't expecting at all. I was hoping it was going to be more realistic. Kinda lost me.",7,2,4,23 November 2019
The Matrix," The Premier Sci Fi
","This is very difficult to outdo. It has so many good connecting parts in the script and scenes that it makes it phenomenal. Opening with Trinity being confronted by the agents, it just draws you in with ferocity. After that, 'you're in' for the duration. It flows well and anyone with user computer experience can get a clue to what's going on. Great cast and great performance. When Morpheus goes thru his explanation to Neo and then to software him out of his machine connection it is a killer.",10,1,2,25 November 2019
Deadpool," I laughed a lot
","This was the part made just for Reynolds. I laughed throughout and usually I don't that much with films. His quips were perfect. Yes its got gore in it, but it seems to lessen due to the humorous takes that go on. Morena Baccarin did her part well as supporting cast.",8,0,2,23 November 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," One of the best
",I must say this is one of the best action movies to date. Watched it many times. I probably love the scenes where Reeves and Common did their clash. I laughed thru some of it too. Kinda like it had everything in it. It was a rush for me.,9,0,0,22 November 2019
Spectre," I admit, this one lacked...
","After seeing Skyfall, it was a step down with Spectre. Seems to have lost some of the luster. They retained Harris in the Moneypenny slot, but they didn't have enough scripted and screenplayed into this to liven it more. Still, these Bond movies are still better than the old ones, so all is not lost. I did also like Ralph Fiennes who was in Skyfall as well. Christoph Waltz is a good actor, but they didn't make him sinister enough.",6,0,5,23 November 2019
Gladiator," Great acting across the board
","Rare do we see movies with casting that makes all the movie enjoyable from start to finish. I've watched this one about 5 times. Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, Harris, Hounsou, and the others were placed well. It ends up being about a man who had everything taken from him and finds himself taking a stand for the people against one who wished to rule by his own will.",9,1,1,7 February 2020
The Martian," This had some real content
","I loved this. Not just because I like space movies, but that it had good acting, script, and execution. I watched it about 5 times and didn't get bored. I thought Chiwetel Eljofore was great in his role. Need more movies of this caliber.",10,1,3,22 August 2019
