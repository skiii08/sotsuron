Your Name.," All the encounters in the world are reunited for a long time
","Gather, form, twist, revolve, return from time to time, rest, and then connect. This is the group button. This is the time. This is the connection.
Knot rope is an opportunity, dreams and forgetting are inevitable, dusk is an accident, can not be found. We are travelers of time, who have known each other for a long time, but have not yet met; time is like a knot, twining each other, maybe we are at both ends of the knot. Do not want to hide and seek in time, separated from you, but this world without you, there must be some kind of meaning of existence. Fortunately, the last three leaves and Taki met.

Se7en," Everyone should be punished
","Arrogance, jealousy, anger, laziness, greed, gluttony, lustEveryone's death method is related to seven sins: eating is supported to death -- gluttony, addict dies in bed -- laziness, actress dies in nose cutting -- pride, lawyer dies in greed The death of these people may be deserved, but the murderer is the devil or the God, what is his judgment standard? Did he also commit a crime? Which of the seven crimes did he commit? He used his jealousy to kill sincere love, anger to kill greed, arrogance to kill laziness The murderer's crime is already above the seven - extreme. Why does the man who commits lust kill the prostitute instead of the client? After all, the killer is a pervert.At the beginning of the movie, there was no voice or face of the main character, just a series of orderly actions. Under these actions, we heard the sirens of police cars, decoration motors, car horns, children's crying Gradually these noisy noises almost cover the voice of the protagonist. This way of expression is very realistic and documentary mode. Does it also symbolize that all evils originate from ordinary life?There are many contradictions in the film, s and m are black, white, old and young, and their personalities are also different; there are several bright lights on the pure dark tone; a large section of shadow background or backlight contrasts with occasionally flashing neon lights, laying out that there will be bright hope in the city wrapped by crime.Morgan's performance has been superb, introverted and calm. It gradually penetrates people's heart in a quiet way. It looks like a poker face, but the change of eyes narrates the story and takes the audience into the whole story.",8,0,1,7 April 2020

Shutter Island," Another heavy movie
","The first half of the movie always makes people nervous. It seems like a crime detection movie. Until Leonardo DiCaprio broke into the lighthouse, everything changed roles. The plot turned to be in a hurry. It turned out that everything was a kind of cooperation, a kind of illusion and a kind of lie. But what puzzled me was what happened to the 'real' Rachel solando I met in the cave? That lighthouse seems to be doing brain surgery, and that's all true. However, Leonardo DiCaprio's last sentence is thought-provoking: 'which would be worth? To live as a monster, or to die as a good man.'",7,0,1,26 March 2020

Hero," Beautiful scenery
","The picture feeling of the movie is particularly beautiful. Hanfu is simple, simple, elegant, elegant and pure in color. The location of the movie is very beautiful. The colorful Danxia in Zhangye is very beautiful. I remember that I went to Zhangye to overlook the colorful Danxia on the paraglider, which is very gorgeous. I had to admire the ghost axe craftsmanship of the nature, the unique geographical environment, which created the most beautiful colorful Danxia. The composition of the movie is also very good, Atmosphere, and in a yellow poplar forest, the contrast between the red clothing and the yellow leaves is very good, and the visual impact is very strongAs well as the expression of Chinese characters and calligraphy, the ancients said that the characters were like human beings, and only those who were very right and generous could write the bold and generous characters,To find the meaning of life in nature, everyone is small.

Brave," Film review
","Unlike Pixar's animated feature films in the past, brave is the first non modern movie featuring real people. Although it is generally believed that this movie represents Pixar's average level, it is not as shocking as toy story, undersea story and flying house.The story takes place in the distant ancient Scotland. The bad tempered Princess Merida is arranged by the powerful Queen's mother to marry the most powerful prince among the three tribes. But the ambition of the first-class princess with red hair and archery is far more than that. Moreover, the princes of the three tribes are all the fighting men who can't support them. But mother, Merida atmosphere ran to the trees, but accidentally met the witch. She asked the witch for a charm that could change her mother's decision, but she didn't expect to get into big trouble.The background of the story is quite mythical, but it is about the conflicts that every family may encounter: rebellious girls and overprotective mothers. When playing back the recording, I heard my laughter and cry, because there was a time when we thought our knowledge and experience had surpassed our parents, we could make decisions for ourselves and hurt them. Only when we know that we have made mistakes and really caused great losses or injuries to our parents can we realize our childishness at that time and lower our arrogant and stubborn head. Merida makes up for her mistakes with her wit and perseverance. Although it's a Disney style reunion, if it can bring positive information to children, why not?The film's picture is based on Merida's red hair, which is very retro and bright. Merida's triplet brother is very naughty and cute. Although there is no breakthrough in 3D effect, the details are perfect and worth tasting.",7,0,0,28 March 2020

Alice in Wonderland," Alice in Wonderland
","The plot of the film is still relatively simple, nothing more than justice over evil, and the beautiful fairy tale scene is more suitable for women and children audience. 3D is much worse than avatar.In the film, Alice follows the rabbit into the tree hole and revisits the place where she came from. She is especially here, but her face and mind are totally different. Here, she sees all kinds of people as colorful as a zoo, from a dormouse who likes bullying and bluffing to a mentally deranged 'Mr. crazy hat', from a 'cat who often shows his teeth and laughs' to a caterpillar who likes a water pipe bag and is named Abu Solon, from a 'Red Queen' who is psychologically abnormal to wear the ultimate 'White Queen', a In the hysteria of taking advantage all day but not suffering from losses, a pretentious and pretentious reserve is the pathological contest between two kinds of adult world. After a series of dangerous accidents, Alice will find her lost self again in this fairy tale worldThe dream in this story is undoubtedly the reflection of the real world, and Alice is still avoiding the expectations of the world.

","Such a simple play can also move me. Such an old plot that can't be older, even the ending that three-year-old children know, also makes me feel good. What can I say? Is the appeal of the movie very good? Ha ha, it really has a bit of appeal. Think about it. The animation of more than ten years ago, to achieve this level, is really good. It's a bit of a musical drama. There are many songs in it. It's good to enjoy it slowly. Although it's just a plane animation, it's not as three-dimensional as the current animation. It doesn't look awkward.Although it's an old movie, an animated film, and no plot, it's a good movie.",7,0,0,9 May 2020

The Wolf of Wall Street," Wolf's impression on Wall Street
","The story told by the Wolf of Wall Street occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which was 20 years ago. Today, 20 years later, the financial fraud on Wall Street has not only not converged, but has intensified, its means are more changeable, the decoration is more gorgeous, the concealment is more profound, and the impact is even greater. Belfort's scam was nothing compared to today's scam. Under the guidance of money and desire, more outlaws set up all kinds of tricks to defraud investors of their wealth. 'We haven't learned our lesson, and things haven't changed,' Terence Winter, the screenwriter of Wolf of Wall Street, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. This means that the fraud on Wall Street will continue normally with (Business as usual). The film does not provide an answer to how to put an end to Wall Street moths because there are no ready-made and easy answers in real life. However, from the perspective of literary and artistic works, the film reveals these ugly traditions, links and insiders on Wall Street. It sounded a wake-up call for people. As far as this is concerned, I think this is a film worth watching.",8,0,0,19 March 2020

I chose this time by accident, but it seems to be an inappropriate time, because now the little heart can't stand such touching love. Maybe when you see something, you will unconsciously wet your eyes, drop a tear, and break a whole night.I wonder if I should change the plot and the ending just like when Wall-E was repaired.

","Before watching JOJO rabbit, except for the trailer, I didn't have any presupposition about the film, I didn't know much about the director, and I didn't read the original novel caging skins. JOJO rabbit's clip rhythm is interesting, bright and terrifying. Director Taika waititi's JOJO's imaginary Hitler also adds a lot of laughs and highlights to the film.

The Great Gatsby," A little disappointed
","On the contrary, the second-class movies are often just the footnotes of the first-class novels, or the footnotes of the first-class novels.This movie proves the truth of this seemingly bumpy movie again.All the criticisms, of course, can also be said to be the strong personal style of the director. Yes, it's gorgeous, fast and dazzling. Maybe it's the embodiment of paper intoxication in Chinese. However, it's not Gatsby as we understand it, or Gatsby as Fitzgerald.In the novel, Fitzgerald's description is calm, motionless, or there is another famous saying, which is ambiguous. This style runs through the whole novel.It's the distance between the novel and the film that makes me not dare to say how well the film is shot. I can only say, well, it's also an interpretation.Both Mulligan and DiCaprio are my favorite actors. Daisy's appearance is still amazing. Of course, Mulligan's performance is satisfactory to me, and Leonardo has no obvious flaws.But it can't hide the clumsiness of computer technology in expressing a feeling. That kind of technology is gorgeous sometimes and fake big empty is just one meaning.And Lana diori's voice is just like that of a computer. No matter how gorgeous and retro, it's still a plastic face, which is not in line with our impression of the great prosperity of the jazz age. Although I like this soundtrack and am very happy with the rap and wall street bull market, I can't help but remind myself that this is not an MV after all, it should be a movie.",7,0,0,18 April 2020
