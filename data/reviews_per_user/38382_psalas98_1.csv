First Man," First half is pretty boring
","Too long of a movie. The first half should have been cut much shorter and then this movie would have been really beautiful. The second half of the movie, when they actually get to the Apollo missions, was intense, engaging, and visually stunning, and I'd recommend it for that.",6,1,1,26 July 2019
