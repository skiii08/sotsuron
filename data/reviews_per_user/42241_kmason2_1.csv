The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Enough With the Hate Please!
","First of all, anyone who is still not a Twilight fan or has never read the book has no reason to watch this movie. Simply posting a review to push away potential fans shows a great deal of immaturity. If you weren't going to like the story, which admittedly has little action, you probably shouldn't have gone to see it. On to the movie, I went to a midnight premiere and had to sit on the front row because we were only about a minute early and the theater was already filled to capacity. I didn't mind as soon as the movie started as I was enchanted with the happenings on screen. The wedding scene could not have been any more perfect or beautiful. What made it all the more poignant, to a fan like me, was the music featured in the ceremony. As Bella and Edward are reciting their vows, 'Flightless Bird, American Mouth' plays in the background and serves as a powerful tie of the couple's history together. Then, the music that was playing in Eclipse in the bed scene, 'My Love' by Sia, is featured instrumentally while Bella's human friends are looking at the cake. This movie finally stayed faithful the book, only including such scenes as the toast speeches that only add more to the story rather than taking away. Any fan of Twilight will enjoy this movie and I daresay the more intense scenes will appeal to non-fans. Make sure and stay after the credits for an extra scene featuring the Volturi.",Null,7,15,19 November 2011
