Howl's Moving Castle," Great movie, best watched with friends tho
","The movie is quite frankly, one of the most imaginative, creative movies I've seen this year. The general story is so utterly fantastic that you immediately know that it can't happen in real life. My only complaint is that there are so many times where it justdoesn't make ne sense. At the start of the movie, well, you basically have to take a long time to make sense of everything thats happening, especially since if u don't comprehend Japanese, everything has to be co-ordinated between your reading and watching. The ending really disappointed me, because it basically made so little sense it ruined (to a small extent) the wonderful experience of Howl's moving castle. What do I say? I recommend it to everybody, because it really has a good blend of the ingredients for wide appeal movies. Don't watch ne voice over versions, it completely ruins the delicate balance the movies achieve, especially when one character's lines stretches for 5 seconds after the animation's mouth has stopped moving.",9,2,4,3 April 2005
