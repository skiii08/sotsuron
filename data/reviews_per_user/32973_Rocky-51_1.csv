Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything I expected, even Jar Jar!
","Awesome! The sound was incredible; the visuals were stunning; the stunts indescribable! While Jar Jar Binks is somewhat annoying, the way he blended in with the completely live action characters was impressive (most impressive). This film lays what seems a good foundation for the saga; I can't wait for the next one. The film also had a good pace, not too fast, not too slow. A lot of story to tell, I wasn't sure they'd get to it all. I'll see this one again, something I did not do for the others (even Special Edition) and rarely do for ANY film.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
