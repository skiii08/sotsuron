Blade Runner 2049," Like Tears In The Rain This Will Be Forgotten In The Mists Of Time
","Whereas the original will never be forgotten!I was so hoping for this to be great...or even just good but sadly when I found out it was being directed by the art farty turd of a movie 'Arrival' Villeneuve, I knew immediately it would be all style over substance.What can we say!Bad acting - Gosling bored us to tears!
Poor old Harrison Ford is past his best for sure!
Overly long and tediously arty farty by at least 2 hours!
Bad CGI that overwhelmed and made everything seem false
No real story to speak of - Phillip K. Dick would be ashamed
Style over substance like most things these days!Compare it to the original:-
Magnificent acting from the entire cast from Darryl Hannah To James Edward Olmos!
A soaring score from Vangelis that lifted your heart and soul
A film that actually had a clever and interesting story!
Great visuals made with great models and forgotten art that only Ray Harryhausen , Stan Winston, Rob Bottin and all the greats would appreciate!
Magnificent script with every line and scene a masterpiece of dialogue - who can forget the epic Rutger Hauer 'Tears In The Rain' speech and compare it to this!It did start off well and there was promise but it all descended into an advert for corporate ripoff just like everything from yesteryear these days - ie Star Wars, Star Trek Discovery etc Nothing original just tired old politically correct retreads of the inspired and magnificent days when Cinema was a truly uplifting and wonderous experience.How sad I sometimes feel for the youth of today who will never experience the joys of great acting, great ctors, great stories and being taken from their humdrum lives to another world and another time for a few hours - I remember well the first time i saw Charlton Heston in Planet of The Apes looking up at the Statue Of Liberty, Darth Vader telling Luke 'I am your father' and even Kirk fighting the Gorn in Arena - wonderous times - I no longer feel that anymore - Am I just an old fart or has cinema and film making really become uninspired and playing for the safe dollar especially when I know for a fact that there are literally zillions of good stories that exist in the comics of 2000AD, Tornado and Starlord like 'WOLFIE SMITH', 'FLESH', 'BLACKHAWK', 'MELTDOWN MAN' etc etc etcThats not to say there arent some movies around that are inspired and original 'RIDDICK' and 'PITCH BLACK' to name but two but a classic like Bladerunner should never have been treated like this, its a disgrace!",5,3,9,27 December 2017
Wind River," Refreshing
","At last a decent movie. I was beginning to give up hope this year!Great acting, story and directing what more could one ask for.Shame to see it cost 11 mill and only grossed 4 mill and probably went straight to video; just goes to show audiences these days wouldn't know a good film from a hole in the snow.If you are a discerning viewer, enjoy good solid writing and an engrossing story with great actors, visuals and lots of thought provoking scenes; great shootout scene as well, then this is for you.If you just want cgi, nudity, foul language and bubblegum for the eyes like most of the potato people that society seems to consist of, then go watch Towie or some other reality bullshit - this ain't for you!",7,1,5,8 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Did I just hear Samuel Jackson use the mf word in a PG movie?
","Well the mf moment when Samuel Jackson was scratched by the cat in his eye was the best bit in this movie. I laughed so hard I almost messed my pontalooms and almost gave this 10/10 just for that magical moment but sadly i came back to reality with a thud in the next scene.If they had spent more time finding decent actors and obsessing over the third wave feminist claptrap it might have been decent, instead we have a story that could be any mixed with the usual flying and shooting beams nonsense it was pretty dire.Unfortunately they just threw actors who could not act in to fit the usual BLM narrative as is the want nowadays instead of using good black actors, although the immensely talented Djimon honsu was there but only had a few lines sadly. Then we have the LGBT feminist claptrap mixed in and music so inappropriate at times - i hate to say it but this is why women should not be allowed to direct movies like this as they have not got a clue.Poor old Brie Larsson had about as much charisma as the cheese of the same name and just about as cheesy - god what were they thinking choosing her when they had Margot Robbie or the cat!Puerile rubbish and a clone of every other Marvel drossbag movie out there , absolutely all style over substance for sure and it seems to be getting worse if this is anything to judge by.Samuel Jackson and the mf cat were the best thing in it - At least we now know how Nick Fury lost his eye - The cat did it lol",4,3,6,2 June 2019
The Impossible," Shameful...
","Although the film was well produced I just could not believe that it focused on the lives of a rich white family and although most of the maimed and dead were Thai there was virtually none shown as part of the movie which is a complete disgrace and how it could have been left out I really have not a clue - If I was Thai and had lost people I would have found this film to be very disrespectful and disingenous!Apart from the fact Ewan McGregor is one of the most over-rated actors and he is a fellow Scot I just cannot stand his poor acting skills and his attempts at various accents , in particular he cannot decided whether he is American or British in this film. Watts and the young boy give exemplary performances however so it does merit a fair few stars but would have been so much better if it had been a fairer representation of what the Thai people have experienced.One other thing that really gets my goat - if you check out all the real reviews on here you will notice they are around 1-6 stars then as soon as the real reviewers are posting along come the 9 and 10 star reviews in batches of between 5-10 - each profile having done only one review in their lifetime its so obvious the movie producers are paying people to 'big up' the films ratings and its very sad that IMDB do not have a policy of monitoring and removing these shills.",5,0,3,15 July 2018
Us," Clever and more scifi than horror
","The movie for me got better as it played on and not as many reviewers have said died out towards the end.I cannot for the life of me understand how so many people did not understand the movie and have posted so many questions about who this was and why when it was almost spelled out by the writers.It was a rather novel and interesting plot even though there may have been a fair few plotholes , who cares , its a movie we go to be entertained not disect the movie as we watch it - this for me is an example of how people cannot let their imagination go and just go with the flow and be entertained as well as having everything spelled out on a plate.She was the clone at the end yet so many people did not get it - she swapped in the hall of mirrors.Really good performances and a novel story make this a bit of a treat albeit with a slow beginning it gets better as it goes along until the final denouement!",7,1,4,30 May 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Flash Gordon for the year 2017!
","Replete with 80's arpeggios and synth riffs its a riot of colour and sound.
Love the humour and the characters and the just plain outrageousness of it all.
Its just like Flash Gordon in so many ways!Hardcore fans will probably hate it and I can see their point but it was a real fun rollercoaster ride and thats what cinema was all about - I thought it was lost but this shows its still got heart!Loved all the cameos from the likes of Matt Damon , Dr Strange even pops his head around the door and the pure guts of the director to just go for it - nice one!If you are looking for a movie to bring a smile to your face then this one sure will suffice!",7,0,3,6 March 2018
Ready Player One," Rip Roaring CGI Overload
","And for once it was rather good.Good acting from all concerned and for oldies like me who remember the Atari 2600 and my fave movie 'Excalibur' you will love this movie and all the references to old games , movies and characters - It does become a bit of fun 'see how many you can spot' adventure and I do like the story - very much reminds me of older games like Castle Of Riddles on the BBC Micro mixed with zillions of others - quite a mash-up but it is done extremely well.Great entertainment even if it is a bit of CGI overload!",7,1,3,7 August 2018
Bird Box," The Happening + A Quiet Place with a bit of The Rapture mixed in for good measure!
","And to be fair it was not that bad.I liked the split scenes and the acting was pretty good.
Poor old Sandra Bullock does kinda remind me of Jen from the Dark Crystal after her plastic surgery which does detract ones attention - sad how they all have to go under the knife to keep hollywood directors happy and stay in the limelight.Story was obviously borrowed from and riding on the coat tales of A Quiet Place but was much better than that lacklustre effort.The problem with this film is that although you never see the 'demons' except in drawing form (presumably all the budget went on Bullock and Malkovich's wages lol) so couldn't afford any CGI, I can forgive that but to not have the exact plot explained; was it the rapture or aliens from another world? Same problem that was evident in A Quiet Place is that nothing is ever explained in any way and whilst it is good to have the viewer think for themselves, directors are just taking this now as licence to give us a skeleton plot and story which makes it overall rather unsatisfying!!!Overall though its a well directed and competent performances from all concerned; even though the BLM / LGBT / Diversity agenda is slapping you in the face at every turn as seems the mandate now in Hollywood, it was better than A Quiet Place and did keep my attention which can only be a good thing these days with all the ordure pouring forth from Netflix and Pay Per View.Above average 6 for this one but it will not be joining my movie collection!",6,1,10,18 December 2018
The Hills Have Eyes," A remake better than the original
","This is one of those rare films - A remake that is better than the original.Although we don't have the excellent characters of the first we have some new ones who are equally as frightening , a goodscript, quality actors, great pacing and some fantastic gore for the real gorehounds out there and some well executed scares for all horror fans.They don't make em like this anymore and even the follow up The Hills Have Eyes 2 was equally as good - A franchise that does live up to expectations.",7,1,1,26 April 2020
The Orphanage," Sad and melancholic ghost story
",This is more of a ghost/mystery film than a horror and as such it is actually quite a slow burn but the denouement and build up is masterfully done with some superlative acting and left me with a tear in my eye and if a film can evoke emotions such as that then for me that is the mark of a good film so this gets a good 7/10 from me!,7,1,2,20 November 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Hilarious
","Best laugh I have had since Zombieland.
Two great characters spliced into a montage of horror greats situations.I laughed so hard i messed ma pontaloons!",7,1,4,28 March 2018
A Quiet Place," Most Overhyped Movie in Decades
","Check the first 20 reviews on here every one almost 10/10 which means its the best movie you have ever seen, then check out how many reviews these shills have posted ie 1 and you will realise the producers of this film have employed the booming industry in Pakistan of warehouses full of fraudsters creating false IMDB accounts and posting false reviews - its shameful its allowed to happen and IMDB cannot weed them out. There are actually websites out there like fiverr that will pay you to post false reviews and its a booming industry! Nothing you see these days you can believe from reviews on Amazon to poor old IMDB our favourite film website for years!If you want real reviews you have to skip to the last reviews but IMDB have skewed this by removing the page list so you have to scroll through dozens of false reviews to find the real ones.I was really quite excited about this film and it has turned into one of the biggest disappointments of the year so far - banal script, there is hardly any talking in the movie at all (great for the actors) and so many inconsistencies - where did the creatures come from - aliens or creatures from inside the earth - who knows. Apparently indestructible but she blows its head off with a shotgun and her daughter 13 year old can figure out how to disable them when the army couldn't - supposed to be hyper sensitive to noise but cannot hear a baby crying - The movie is pretty much incredulous and that just makes it silly.The creatures were interesting and the CGI was effective but there was no story or any character development and the end oh dear what can i say - click of a shotgun and we dont see any action and the viewer is left with a blank screen with the credits rolling - truly, truly awful film and not frightening in the least - where did they dig up all these folk who think its the most scary movie they have ever seen - they must be big Jessies is all I have left to say!My brother said the kid - boy/girl androgenous cherub looking strangeness gave him the creeps and was the scariest thing in the movie - not nice to comment on someones fizzog but that is one strange looking actress/actor - still havent worked out if it was a male or female but its the age of LGBT Right? So it seems we have to now have one androgen now in every movie ?Wait and download it on utorrent its simply a waste of Â£10 to pay to see this trash at the cinema - if this is what cinema is in the future then I am afraid Judy Dench is correct when she said recently that the cinema will be dead in 20 years! Possibly sooner if this is anything to judge by - so disappointed it has actually made me quite angry!",3,8,17,14 April 2018
Ex Machina," Alicia Vikanders Cat...
","Pretentious , tedious nonsense..I found this film a bit tedious - If a singularity moment in programming code ever does become intelligent and it spreads via the internet then it will be curtains for humanity in the wink of an eye and not what these films like to portray! A computer will never have emotions or the ability to care, it will react purely based on logic!The film felt soulless and I didnt like any of the actors which kinda puts the mockers on from the start. Wanted to like it , hoped it would be interesting as I am a programmer myself but it fell a bit flat!I digress... You do get the chance to see Alicia Vikander's pussy...but even that was a dreadful disappointment!",5,3,10,25 November 2017
Midsommar," Wicker Man vs The Village
","I was really looking forward to this movie after all the hype but sadly it does not meet expectations.For one it is overly long and could have an hour taken off as this contributes to the languid pace and does not create enough tension.Unlike the Wicker Man from 1973 this film does not conjure up that mystical dread that the original does and the crazy screaming and antics of the cult just becomes laughable after a while and really quite tedious. The Swedes just love to throw in a load of nudity but c'mon guys it was boring in the 70's and its even sadder now that you have to use it to try and excite the viewer.
It seems to be part of a recipe for every so called Arty Nordic movie so really not very original just like the movie itself. It does not even look like Sweden either for anyone who has actually been there!It is indeed a bizarre concoction and tries to go for the foreign scary land and strange customs angle but achieves none of the fear and dread that the brilliant Hostel gives to the viewer. The movie is far too long and this just becomes an exercise in tedium as it meanders its way from scene to scene and they could not even come up with a different ending than the Wicker Man and is really just a very poor copy of an original classic. Even the Nic Cage remake is better than this artsy fartsy effort and you can tell by all the pontificating ever-so-clever shill reviews which just illustrates that half of these so called arty types have not got a clue what the average man in the street wants to watch or even what they are talking about!Very disappointed - It is true... 'Don't Believe The Hype!!!'.",5,2,4,25 September 2019
American Made," Seen it all before and much better
","What a turgid bore fest.Don't get me wrong I like Tom Cruise but we have all seen these stories before and made much better - Lord Of War with Nick Cage was ten times better film than this.Was not exciting in the least - there seemed to be a missing tension in the story; whether this was because of Tom Cruise' blasé performance and seeming safe atmosphere it just didn't convey any danger, suspense or even anything new to add to the genre.Seen it all before drug cartel movies are ten a penny and this was not even worth a penny! Cannot believe the high 7.1 mark for this, just shows the level of expectation of our reality TV generation - how sad!",4,36,69,2 November 2017
Joker," No Masterpiece but it is good and a good depiction of mental illness!
","I cannot believe how they have gone to town paying the shill warehouses in Pakistan and India to rate this movie 10/10 nearly every one of the 10/10 reviews is fake but I guess that and RT now , nothing is real in our virtual reality internet world sadly so here goes with an honest and fair review as always from me.Joker is certainly not fake and it has a great performance from Joaquin but he tries hard but cannot match Heath Ledger unfortunately and I guess that was an impossible milestone to try and reach anyway but he does it well with what he has to work with.The movie itself diverges wildy from the Batman CGI action fantasy overload and atmosphere and is a more true to life down at heel portrayal of a mentally ill person and I actually found it reminded me of Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver - dark , depressing, down at heel but somehow it drags a story and good character development from the miasma and surprisingly in the end you are rooting for the bad guy and cheering when he offs all the rich and powerful characters and I guess that mirrors what 90% of the population are feeling in this day against all the lying , cheating and stealing Bankers, Politicians , Lawyers and the 1% who own 90% of the wealth and could be a rather portentous piece of film making.I did enjoy the movie but it is in no way a masterpiece as some are saying but it is a good watch and delivers a more true to life depiction of what the Joker may have started out as but this will not please the Comic fans I surmise.
I do agree with a previous reviewer in that the modern viewing yoof must have very low expectations if they all think this is such a genius masterpiece, oh how low our standards have fallen since the days of Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen and all the glorious movies from back then that left you truly gasping when you left the cinema or enervated and full of hope for the future; nowadays you leave the cinema with the reinforcement that life truly is sh** for the majority of the populace and there is no hope for the future which is probably true but me personally I go to the cinema to be taken out of my life and to live in a fantasy world for an hour and 40 minutes and that Is what I pay for but hey-ho each to their own.Good film a solid 6.5/10 but nowhere near a 10/10 which these shills forget means it is the best movie you have ever seen? With that in mind is it really worth 10/10 when compared with movies like Ben Hur or Planet Of The Apes or Alien etc???",6,1,3,12 November 2019
Arrival," 2 Hours of my life gone...
","First of all i have to laugh at all the so called scifi intellectuals who think this is a good scifi film and decry anyone who doesn't like it as a moronic sheep.It actually proves who the sheep are - just because a film has a totally moronic plot that defies explanation that immediately makes it profound and somehow mind expanding and that a select few Scifi fans with their heads up their bum understand - yeah right. You get the usual pontificators pointing out that it relates to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and equally long and obscure words to describe what is in essence a turgid , lifeless 2 hours of complete drivel directed by someone who produced the equally depressing Sicario!What I also cannot stand in movies and in general is when information / learning is given and is false - Kangaroo means 'large foot' and does not mean 'I do not understand' which is a complete myth. To make it even more hilarious this myth was debunked in the 1970s by another LINGUIST John B. Haviland in his research with the Guugu Yimithirr people. Having cinema-goers leave the cinema thinking they maybe have learnt something which is false is unforgivable emphasising once more what a con this movie is and how blinkered all of these so called intelligent Scifi buffs are!The movie moves along like a funeral procession with an awful dirge of whining violins how depressing but it illustrates the directors high opinion of what he thinks he is making.Folks this is no epic in any way - its some guy who saw a couple of octopi in an aquarium squirting ink to get rid of predators and thought hey i can make a movie out of this and so proceeded to do so.There are so many plot holes and unbelievable things in this movie like the army being involved in all the decisions - nowhere do we see the President or anyone in charge of operations , a bomb mysteriously gets planted in an alien ship that has travelled millions of miles yet doesn't detect it , the ships mysteriously disappear in a cloud of dust.The whole movie actually looked like it had been shot on a shoestring budget from the poor black eggs hanging in the sky to the cheap ships interiors and if that wasn't bad enough Jeremy Renner looked like he was bored stiff and just looking to pickup a nice paycheque!The only thing i enjoyed was reading the pontificating so called scifi fans that are so much more intelligent than us mere mortals that they thought this film was too intelligent for us to understand - no guys it is you who are too up your own bahookies to see that the director was taking the Mickey out of all of the hoighty toighty Scifi buffs who have no life and cant see the wood for the trees and trees for the wood by making a morose and clichéd retread of a zillion other better movies about the human condition and the meaning of life! The one thing all these co called scifi buffs totally missed is that this film is a blatant ripoff of the old TV Movie Epoch and they call themselves Scifi fans yeah right! There are so many people now that know the price of everything yet the value of nothing - this film wasn't worth the price of a Cinema ticket and it certainly has no value!My brother rated it as the worst scifi film he has seen in years and although I wouldn't go that far it is dreadful in just about every way and this guy is supposed to be directing the classic remake of Bladerunner - Oh dear is all I can say!",2,15,29,16 July 2017
Parasite," Inventive, original and well acted
","What is it with foreign movies! they just seem to be able to pull a new idea out of the bag and deliver it with aplomb and this social commentary of Korea and the world in general is no exception. Different culture, different ideas and way of life perhaps but this movie applies equally to West as it does East and pulls out all the stops to deliver an excellent nights viewing!Very well acted and produced, this just goes to show that there are a shed load of new ideas out there if one is just willing to look for them.",8,3,11,5 September 2019
Mother!," All that is left in art is shock value...
","Yes folks , when hollywood has run out of ideas much as art did many years ago, all it can produce is the shock value, nothing more , nothing less. Its a sad time when most people know the price of everything but the value of nothing... And I think that moment hass been upon us for quite a decade or two now!10/10 means its the best movie you have ever seen.
The folks on here who give this ordure 10/10 are in one of two categories - In a padded cell with access to tv or the anally, retentive pretentious, luvvies (or ones who want so much to be part of the 'in crowd') who actually think this is more than one of Aronofsky's bad trips on Lsd or an overdose of the magic mushies!Pretty sad isnt it when all artists have now to bring to the world is the value of shock treatment which is all this really is and all Aronofsly was clearly doing was stirring up a pot of controversy to give this a bit of advertising pure and simple. I could crap on a piece of paper and call it a modern critique of contemporary art , have it framed and no doubt the types who give this movie 10/10 on here will hail me as the new Tracy Emmin of the art world.It is of no merit artistically and anyone who thinks it is well they may one day disappear up their own backsides. Aronofsky isnt being pretentious, he is just a smart trickster who had a bad trip and decided to take the piss out of you the audience and if you fell for it more shame on you!",2,1,2,29 December 2017
Annihilation," Oh dear another disappointment
","What is it these days - the directors seem more interested in the style over the content of movies.Started well, some nice set pieces and the visuals and aural soundscape were well done but the story was another kindred to the awful 'Arrival' where us ordinary folks just didnt get it apparently.
It was slow and lugubrious with the only things of interest being the colourful visuals and very little story, character development or acting ability - I hate to disagree but I have always found Natalia Portman to be insipid and utterly without merit as an actress and most of the rest of the cast were forgettable too - Now Michelle Rodriguez or many other talented actresses I could mention would have blown this lot out of the water and actually made the film more enjoyable.So us 'not as intelligent as you Scifi experts just didnt get it' - Not really its typical of the Anal Sci-Fi brigade that believe if you didnt understand the movie or 'get it' then you are just not part of the cognoscenti of Scifi nerdula! Some of the reviews on here with their pontification much like the ones on 'Arrival' really make me laugh!If you have nothing to say then tis' better to say nothing and this movie said absolutely nothing to me at all. Such a disappointment too as I was hoping for something but with Portman being the lead actress that kinda set the scene for this overhyped 'Butterfly Effect' short story and movie ripoff. Been done before and much better with less money!",5,0,4,13 March 2018
Spectre," Dull - The reason Bond was so successful in the 70's
","Sean Connery and Roger Moore had savoire faire, wit , personality and was something many men of the day aspired to.Daniel Craig is like a block of wood - unemotional, poor actor despite what many might say and doesnt have any of the traits of the originals.You can stick in any special effects, CGI and amount of money - if you dont have Bond right you will never have a true bond movie. Even the Bond girls are like a poor mans Ursula Andress or Maude Adams, Honor Blackman - now they had personality and smouldered the silver screen!I would also add that although Dave Bautista was not bad there arent any really memorable henchman anymore - Odd Job , Jaws, Wint & Kidd and even Rosa Klebb with her knife-shoes all had a gimmick and a really memorable part in the movie - the makers seem to miss all these ingredients now and just settle for the standard 'crash, bang, wallop what a picture' model!This was like all of the recent Bond movies over the last decades - following a boring old formula with a poor mans James Bond actor who brought nothing new or surprising to the character but actually made him seem like a boring old fart in reality with no sense of humour, no sense of style or wickedness like Connery and Moore gave us.To be honest none of the Bonds since Moore have been much good or even on a par with the real Bonds (Connery & Moore)! Even George Lazenby and David Niven were better than any that followed Moore!I give it an average mark because the magnificent Christophe Waltz does his usual superlative performance, he doesnt seem to be able to do any wrong and played the villain with aplomb.",5,1,7,7 January 2018
