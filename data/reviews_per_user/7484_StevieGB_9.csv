The Sound of Music," The horror, the horror.
","Terrible, sicky, gooey, mess.  I'm 34 now, and maybe one day I'll like this film but I very much doubt it.  When I was young I used to picture the audience for this film as slightly deaf old women in surgical stockings and bad hats, and my attitude still holds.No, you say, it's good old fashioned entertainment with hummable tunes!No, I reply, it's crap.  I don't care how many people have seen it and liked it.  A lot of people saw and liked Hitler.A film of hidden shallows.  But a good way of torturing teenage boys for a couple of hours.",2,9,33,22 April 1999
Insomnia," Don't lose any sleep over it
","A pale imitation of a great original which most Americans won't ever bother to check out because it's foreign, there's no one famous in it and they can't be bothered to read subtitles.  UK viewers with cable or satellite can occasionally catch the original on Film4, which is where I saw it.   It' a dark, menacing film, with a lead character that you empathise with rather than like, and an ending where not everyone gets their comeuppance.  The new version...it's as though someone has taken the original and chewed it up until it's soft and mushy to spoon feed it to a baby.  If this version had been made first no one would want to remake it.  The characters are either easily recognisable cop types or a 'Look, it's Robin Williams' type killer. The first twenty minutes of the script is toe-curlingly awful, the dialogue is so banal.  The acting is all mediocre, except for Martin Donovan's death scene and a couple of Robin Williams' phone calls.  The photography is excellent, but it's used to show how beautiful the landscape is rather than tell the story.  Christopher Nolan can make great movies - but this is not one of them.  I suspect in five or ten years he will say so himself.",Null,0,0,28 August 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Hollow.
",Looks good.  Badly written.  Johnny Depp can't act.  Typically bad Danny Elfman score (how many more times?).  Lots of little mistakes which the audience aren't supposed to carp about (exhumed dead bodies don't bleed).I saw the film at the National Film Theatre.  The notes quoted Tim Burton as saying that Johnny Depp would be a wonderful silent film actor.  I agree. But this isn't a silent film.,Null,0,1,7 March 2000

American Beauty," Don't believe the hype. Look closer. Angst lite.
","Emperor's new clothes.A film set in suburbia made by people who've never lived there.  A film that would love to be an early 70's Bob Rafelson movie with Jack Nicholson but it comes nowhere near.  If you don't know what I'm talking about watch 'Five Easy Pieces'.  Characters do things because the scriptwriter says so and to get a laugh. Does that look like a family to you?  These people look live they've never even met.  Kevin Spacey isn't very good.  This is a troubled man?  I don't think so. He brings nothing to the film (again compare with early Nicholson, whose characters looked like they had a past, even if you never knew the details). Spacey looks like a man who has just turned up for a few days shooting.  He plays a man who wants to be good at being mildly sarcastic to people.The end?  The message.  A guy's brains on a table can be beautiful.  A plastic bag blowing in the wind can be beautiful.  Look closer.  You've been had, sucker.",4,0,0,15 February 2000
American Beauty," 'Look closer'. What at? There's nothing there!
","What are you all on?  You all seem to have lost your critical faculties. Please wake up and get a grip!  So many of you are gushing on about the beauty of a plastic bag blowing in the wind.  And how much money did you part with to see this?  Ever heard of 'outside'?  It's cheaper.This film is directly appealing both to the intellectual snobbery and lack of confidence in all of us.  'If I don't like it there must be something wrong with me.  Only clever people can share the insights that this film has to give, all the reviews agree.'  If you don't like the film say so, don't be pressured by the numbers.This film isn't poetry, it just thinks it is.  It's also sloppy.  Remember the opening sequence?  'Would you like me to kill your dad?'  'Gee, would you?' etc.  This has no importance at all to the unfolding of plot, story, character development, etc.  It's there for effect.  Nothing else.  That or they were going to remove it and forgot.These are not real people, these are not real relationships, they do not have real problems and they do not have real jobs.  OK?And there are just too many close ups of Kevin Spacey.",4,1,2,22 February 2000
Shrek 2," Drivel
","What is wrong with everyone? This is an awful film. It's just a collection of references to other films (does spotting their sources make you feel clever?), some technically impressive but soulless animation and a publicity department working overtime. It would have taken just as much time, effort and money for them to make a good film, so why didn't they? As always it's the script that no one can be bothered with. Next time get the story right BEFORE you book the talent and facilities. If I'd been connected with this film I'd be embarrassed, but I suppose I'd laugh it off in a 'yeah, maybe, but look how much I got paid' way. Is there any way I can get my money back?",Null,1,2,17 December 2004
From Dusk Till Dawn," Lacks bite.
","This is one of those films where, half way through, you realise that you're not actually having that much fun.  Lots of stuff going on, but none of it really interesting.  It isn't scary, and we don't like or care about anyone.It's also a remake of 'Vamp' which, for all its faults, was funny, had a couple of likeable characters, and managed to produce a couple of scary moments.",Null,0,0,16 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A supermodel of a film.
","When people talk about the infantilisation of the cinema audience this is the sort of thing they're talking about.  They've spent a lot of time and money on it, and some (though not all) of the effects are good, but as a drama it's a failure.  This is not art, and it never could be.  Art tells us about the experience of life; this does nothing of the sort.  The goodies are good and the baddies are bad (and ugly); these are not complex, conflicted characters, but comic book cut outs.  It's an Athena poster come to life.  Much of the acting is awful.  The dialogue is embarrassing.  The comic relief scenes are worse even than those in Shakespeare.  The story ends half an hour before the film which, except when the battle scenes are underway, is agonisingly slow and ponderous.  A supermodel of a film: flashily dressed and good looking but not much upstairs.",Null,0,1,9 July 2004
