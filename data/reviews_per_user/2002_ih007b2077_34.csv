The Ring," I owe Naomi.
","I would personally like to thank Naomi Watts for bringing her considerable talent to the big screen. I was totally mesmerised by her performance, just as I was in 'Mulholland Drive'. She's got that Bette Davis-like presence which transforms good movies, which 'The Ring' definitely is, into very good ones. I cannot think of a better actress than her, and whilst films like this don't win Oscars, I'm sure she will one before long. The minute she appears, after what is already one of the best starts of any movie I have seen for ages, you're gripped, and, mainly because of her convincing style, you don't so much suspend disbelief at the plot, but actually want to believe that it's all true. There are many creepy moments. This isn't, thankfully, a gore-fest, nor does it have you jumping totally out of your seat, but it does get you on the edge of it on a regular basis. And for once, CG effects complemented the film, because at least you don't have to worry about cruelty to animals any more...hopefully! My one criticism is that it seemed to me to deliberately leave a big opening for a sequel. Had this been not quite so obvious, I wouldn't have minded, but this aside, I thought it was very good, and the best 'scary movie' I've seen since...well, since 'Mulholland Drive'! Naomi rules!!",9,1,1,23 February 2003
Monster," Was she?
","I don't now if I'm alone here, but the first two victims had it coming! (Well, definitely the first one in any case). Initially, when she won the Oscar, I was a bit cheesed off as Naomi Watts is my favourite actress and I didn't see how anyone could beat her performance in '21 Grams'. OK. I was wrong. Theron's performance is awesome, even taking account of the completely altered appearance. Christina Ricci, who I adore, seemed somewhat dumbstruck (which she's good at anyway - witness her semi-wordless role in 'The Man Who Cried', an underrated movie)in the company of Theron's 'monster'. I really believe, watching Ricci closely (as I always do!), that the camera captures her actually admiring her co-star's acting during their many scenes together. It is almost as if she cannot believe that it is Charlize Theron opposite her, acting as if her life depended on it. Ultimately, CR's performance is somewhat marred and overshadowed by this awe of her co-star. It doesn't matter, though, because she does her job as the easily manipulated and unwitting ally in the unfolding of events. The film does not glamorise proceedings. It is as gritty as '21 Grams' without its tricks of confused chronology. I liked it, even though most of the audience grimaced in their seats. Not as depressing as '21 Grams' in spite of the subject matter.  Simple direction and story-telling perfectly recreates the seediness of the story. I hadn't realised that the woman was now dead. I assumed she would be considered ill, but maybe that doesn't alter the American system...Now, would Charlize please go back to being glamorous and leave Naomi to take over for the next few Oscars. And Christina Ricci needs a leading role to properly fulfill her acting abilities and finally emerge as a true Hollywood Great, which she will, I'm sure. 8 out of 10. Why was it an 18? A 15, surely...",Null,0,0,18 April 2004
Underworld," In the So-Bad-It's-Good Category
","Well, almost. I had to see this twice before penning any review. This is a fantasy action film, much in the vein (!) of many other fantasy action films. The mood is dark and the music is upbeat, and the story is quite good. Kate Beckinsale looks good in black leather, whilst 'Erika' looks even better in more traditional vampire gear. There are so many noteworthy unintentionally funny bits in this that when you see it for a second time, you can't help laughing when you spot them. This is definitely not for feminists. How many times are the women told to 'Leave us' so that the chaps can have a proper chat?! The voice of the big dark werewolf sounded like he'd swallowed ten sheets of sandpaper and washed it down with a jug of rusty nails. I'm sure you can spot the rope attached to the flying 'Michael' in one scene. And those doors....if you thought that Nicole Kidman's job was a difficult one in 'The Others', then she'd have a nightmare if she had to follow behind this lot. I've never seen so many door-opening scenes. I guess the Director likes to create dramatic impact in moving from one set to another, but this was like watching 'Alice in Wonderland' on speed. Kate Beckinsale really does pick them. The diabolically bad 'Pearl harbour'; the tame 'Serendipity'; and the boring 'Golden Bowl'. I've yet to see her in a good movie, but she always looks very nice. I suppose this was never going to be my kind of movie, but it was worth seeing just to count the number of doors being opened. I guess that's the reason behind the shooting the hole in the floor scene. Maybe Kate said to the Director: 'If I've got to open one more of these doors, I'm quitting'. Perhaps it would have been better if she had.",Null,0,0,5 October 2003
The Girl Next Door," New eyes needed for peeping Tom
","This film is just about as good as teen comedy gets. It has everything, from the sordid to the subtle, in the way of humour. The story is well-worn but seems fresh. It is funny and is also engaging, thanks to good writing and a very good cast. The movie overall is not a classic or anything, but definitely showcases two new talents to great effect. I have read another British reviewer who has likened Emile Hirsch to Leonardo diCaprio. To me he seemed more like a combination of Ewan Macgregor and someone who I can't quite recall. He is really good in this movie, bringing the kind of youthful screen presence more associated with older, established stars. His comic timing is excellent, and he is surely a big name for the future. The supporting cast are all effective and engaging, including Timothy Olyphant, who is likeable even when we see his character's nasty side. Which brings me, finally, to Elisha Cuthbert...I haven't watched '24' so was totally unfamiliar with her. All I can say is that there are elements of Marilyn Monroe here.  A sparkling talent for comedy, combined with both the natural and sexy appeal of Monroe, she simply can't fail in dismantling the crowns of every other pretender aspiring to be the Queen of Hollywood. She is a competent actress, whose looks may in fact thwart her acting abilities, but that's life. Meryl Streep got the roles, but Cuthbert can't help it if she looks like Aphrodite. Actually, 'Goddess' is an insult to her. My God, what a woman! Oh yes, the film....6 out of 10, which is good in my scale. 19 out of 10 for Miss C.",Null,0,0,24 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," tHE pERFECT bLOCKBUSTER
","Think of Superman 2 and how much better it was than the original. Then double it. You then get a bit closer to how good Spider-Man 2 is. With the exception of the Green Goblin being the villain with the greater fun factor, this sequel does for S-M what the plural did for 'Alien', and certainly what happened to the Superman series. I can't think of a better blockbuster, certainly not a comic one, in any event. Give the movie-makers a pat on the back. Average Hollywood fare can be forgiven in the light of this Marvel masterpiece. It really has everything a good film should have. Behind the guise of Peter Parker, we have a super-hero. Behind the guise of a comic book caper, we have just about all the ingredients of any movie classic. Tobey Maguire is on very top form, and that's saying something. He has the kind of high profile that holds mediocre films together. He is always watchable, but this is surely his finest hour, and I truly believe he should be nominated for Oscar glory, such is the magnitude of the performance. This is the Hamlet of the comic strip world. The great thing about this is that it can appeal to tastes on many different levels. Aside from the impressive, and sometimes frightening, action, there are moral issues and human dilemmas which soap operas would be proud to address. Danny Elfman's music, and the sharp, pinpoint direction, with no wasted or superfluous scenes, make this a thrill ride from beginning to end. They simply cannot top this movie. And finally. It had to happen sooner or later. Miss Dunst at last comes of age in a performance which makes Scarlett O'Hara seem like a bit part. She is truly outstanding, and gorgeous (even with the red hair), making this movie stand alongside such classics as 'Titanic', which most people seem to slag off these days. Well, the viewing public can't be wrong, because the money made by these movies says an awful lot. People still like good old-fashioned romances, and when combined with great spectacle, such as huge liners sinking, or Spider-Man saving MJ from Doc Ock (!)it proves my long-held belief that they don't make 'em like they used to, except in this instance, they clearly do. 9 out of 10. Don't know why it isn't 10 out of 10 really, but it must have some flaw..where?! I am not particularly a fan of comic book movies, but this is quite exceptional.

Finding Nemo," Maritime Memento
","My favourite character, Dory, has short-term memory loss, so that's why I was reminded of 'Memento'. I saw this film by accident, because my original choice was thwarted because 'the film had broken down'. What  good fortune because otherwise I suppose I may never have experienced 'Finding Nemo'. This was definitely the best animation I have ever seen, Disney classics aside. (You know, the 'real' animation.) Forget 'Monsters Inc'. That was good. Even the Toy Story movies aren't as good as this one, in my opinion. There isn't a dull moment in this highly intelligent film, which, on the fish face of it, sounded pretty boring. This is the real 'Ocean's 11'...getting to Nemo at the eleventh hour. When I watch a film like this, I wonder how other script-writers sleep at night. This has got more class than a hundred non-animated films I could mention put together. There is simply nothing bad to say about this movie. My only negative thought is that I was hoping the shipwreck was going to be the 'Titanic'! (but we were in the wrong ocean for that.) I liked the 'other movie jokes' such as 'Terminator' and felt that a mickey-take of 'Titanic' could have been appropriate, especially as some idiots have just voted it the worst film ever made. Well, it gets in my top five, actually -'titanic' that is, because I can't really 'do' cartoon lists. If I did, 'Peter Pan' would be my number one, with 'Finding Nemo' in that top five somewhere. I am almost considering buying this film eventually, it's that good. 8 out of 10. Impossible to dislike this, unless you're born miserable.",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
The Others," Middling but with no middle
","'The Others' is a strange sort of film. It's neither good nor bad, and, oddly, I can't say 'it could have been much better' (as with many other movies) as I doubt if it could, given the subject matter and the enclosed arena, in which all of the film is set. I know nothing about the story's background, but it is very theatrical, so maybe it started life as a play(?) It's one of those films whereby you can't say too much about it, for fear of spoiling it for the others, but suffice to say it is a ghost story, and, although it contains no sex, violence or expletives, definitely merits the '12' certificate. With the ghostly ingredients of a spooky house, two frightened children and a quirky performance from Nicole Kidman, I expected to enjoy this so much more than I did. I think the main problem is that the story has no real 'middle'. It starts and finishes adequately but drags in the middle, and, as I said, I doubt if, with the subject matter, this could have been improved upon. Overall, middling entertainment.",Null,0,0,31 October 2001
Sleepy Hollow," My favourite movie of the decade
","I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie, both at the cinemas and on video. I never tire of it, and I usually like to watch it when I'm in a bad mood! It doesn't improve my mood, but it actually makes me enjoy being in a bad mood! Everything has been said before but I'm still going to sing the praises of a marvellous supporting cast. Really, everyone seemed to be having a great time making this film. Christopher Walken, in particular, is on fire as the bonce-lopping horseman. His supporting roles of recent years have been gems. The music and the art direction are amazing. I wish I had seen this film as a younger person. I think it would have scared the pants off me. Finally, the main reason this film is so wonderful is the combination of Mr Depp and Ms Ricci, whose on-screen magnetism together is electric. My favourite scene is when he asks her why she is in his room. But there's so many...",Null,0,0,23 October 2001
Alien," Menace not Mayhem
","Having just watched this film, for the first time in its entirety, I am following yesterday's review for the sequel. Somehow I have managed to miss this movie before, even though it is 24 years old (Couldn't they have waited until 2004 for the 'traditional' anniversary release?) I didn't think I would be writing this review as I said I only would do so if it was better than 'Aliens'. Well, for those who watched it on its initial release, I expect this is still held in higher regard. But, for me, 24 years later, 'Aliens' still has the edge. They are really quite different movies, in that the sequel, as sequels generally tend to do, goes for all-out action, but whereas most follow-ups pale in comparison to the original, 'Aliens' actually goes one better, and does not lose sight of the importance of tension, as well as the action. 'Alien' is a much slower film, filled with tense creepy moments, and less mayhem. There are, after all, fewer crew members to dispose of here. I was surprised that it didn't really look dated, except when you see how young the cast look. The weakest 70s giveaway is the occasionally inappropriate music. Other than that, it is still very 'contemporary' in its feel. Sigourney Weaver looks terrific and gradually makes her presence felt as the tension mounts. I reckon I have watched the first half before, but the final hour was unfamiliar to me. It is said that all great thrillers, if the Alien films can be placed in that category as well as horror and sci-fi, work better if the tension outweighs the graphic depiction of events. On this level, 'Alien' is great, but 'Aliens' was as tense, if not more so, and a terrif action movie to boot. So, whereas I gave 'Aliens' 9 out of 10, I award 8 out of 10 to the original.",Null,0,1,1 November 2003
Lost in Translation," Slow Boat To Tokyo
","First things first. I expected to like this film, and I did like it. But it was not the event I had hoped for. Normally I take to these sedately-paced stories of human emotion and art-house-type presentation. The whole thing is just so painfully slow, however, and I really can't see how it can have attracted such high praise. The direction, scenery and music are all good. And yet there is nothing strong enough about the central characters to make them dominate a slow movie. I certainly admire Scarlett Johansson, having watched her emerge in both 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and the wonderful 'Ghost World'. Unfortunately, in this role, she doesn't quite have the presence to pull off the impossible - that is, make something of a character who seems to have no real soul. Bill Murray, although I still don't like him, is capable, but I found him miscast. This movie needed a Nicholson or a Hoffman, but I know they're too old now. Where have all the young gifted actors disappeared to? I rate this movie 5 out of 10, and cannot fathom why the critics are foaming at their mouths. It does have great 'bits' but there are far too many meaningless slow periods. My favourite bit was the golf drive, which seemed to be heading for the volcano. Even this shot was out of context and performed for effect. I was half expecting some sub-title to tell me that this was meaningful. Worth watching on a rainy day, but wait for it to be free.",10,2,4,10 January 2004
Lost in Translation," Boy, was I wrong!
","This is my second review of this movie. After watching it six times, I felt compelled to make amends to my earlier, and thoroughly wrong, review. I really don't know what I was thinking about to suggest that Scarlett Johansson was not up to the part, or that Bill Murray was miscast. I was simply overcome by pre-cinema bias against Mr Murray; and also because I like 'Ghost World' so much. How I was wrong. I am now wondering if 'Lost In Translation' is some kind of modern-day 'Brief Encounter'. The slowness still agitates new audiences, much as it made me fidget, but you have to see through the sedate pace and realism. I, of course, did not do that either initially, and I was only swayed to watch it again after the awards season. But I'm glad I did. All I can say to those people who thought this movie was both too slow and over-rated, is that it's worth giving it another try. Every scene now seems perfect, and I haven't got a single criticism, although I still prefer 'Girl With A Pearl Earring' to see Scarlett Johansson's full acting skills. In all, I have now made 16 trips to the cinema this year involving Ms. Johansson. I still think Naomi Watts is the best actress, but SJ is not far behind her. A truly magnificent actress, and still under 20. Sofia Coppola will find it hard to emulate this masterpiece. I've now taken my bias blindfold off...",10,0,1,27 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Don't clone the groans
","Overall, I enjoyed Episode II but if the whole series of six films is to gel, then Episode III must be better. In my opinion, episodes 1, 2, 4 and 5 (forgetting Return of The Jedi for a moment), each get better than the one before. Therefore, the first is pretty average; the second much better; the fourth (the 'original') better still; and the fifth (Empire) the best, in my opinion. Then it deteriorates with 'Jedi', but only back to the standard of 'Clones', which is very good. The main flaw in this new episode is that the film is just too long. Twenty minutes shaved off could have tightened it up a heck of a lot, but it does drag in the middle. I agree with a lot of reviewers that the love affair between Annakin and Padme are drawn out. The thing that saves it is the haunting music of John Williams, which I feel is his best in the series. But I have heard it said that when you start to really listen to a film's score whilst watching the movie, your attention is waning. That aside, the majority of the movie is good fun. At last, I enjoyed Ewan McGregor's performance. He is the mainstay of this in a similar, but not as superb, way that Harrison Ford was in the earlier movies. Unlike others, I didn't actually like Christopher Lee in this. It follows too hot on the heels of his part in the 'Rings' film. The flaws are outweighed by some great action and inventive set-pieces. And C3PO is very funny. I'm glad he turned up when he did. And finally, in the face of some terrible dialogue, Natalie Portman is shaping up to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. Hard to believe that someone so plain as Princess Leia could be produced by her! 7 out of 10. Episode 3 needs to be even better to justify three prequels.",Null,0,1,31 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Monster Zinc
","Perhaps I've seen too many 'twist' movies lately, but I really was expecting to see a monster called 'Zinc' as a sort of play on words. I couldn't really understand why else would they have chosen such a rubbish title! I mean, how many kids are going to understand it? How about: 'Mum, there's a monster in my closet' ? OK, not too great, but Monsters Inc? There wasn't even a scary squid to squirt a bit of this famous 'inc'. Overall, I think the film is good, but, save for a few bits of genius, it's not in the same league as the 2 Toy Story movies, and is definitely not as good as 'Shrek' which was the best animation movie since Buzz Lightyear and Co. (Now, I've started doing it. It could have been 'Monsters.Com'. Anything's better than inkless 'inc'). The great bits are Billy Crystal's 'eye', which confirms that he is best suited to hiding his body from us; the very original concept of the 'monsters-eye view'; and the chase on the doors, which I think is probably the best bit of any animated movie I've ever seen. It's the meat and veg of the film which I found a bit wanting. A sub-plot was craved to take the heat out of the little girl's interference with the monster world. There seemed to be a lot more mileage to be had from the doorways to different worlds, but I expect we'll get that in 'MI 2' Oh no, they can't use that title. 7 out of 10, but overrated, I'm afraid.",Null,0,1,11 February 2002
The Thing," That Thing You Do
","I was lucky enough to see 'The Thing' on its first release in 1982. I saw it twice in 3 days at 'The Gaiety' cinema in Bristol. I recall it clearly. After 20 years, I can still vividly recall the opening shots, of a guy in a helicopter desperately trying to shoot a German Shepherd dog running through the snow in Antarctica. I still remember willing him to miss. It's a classic moment, because as the story unfolds, your hatred of the cruel, would-be pet killer completely disappears when you realise why he was trying to shoot him. Although there are many similarities to the Alien movies, 'The Thing' belongs on its own as a movie. The effects are great for 1982, and whereas most of today's horror movies carry a '15' certificate, you can still see why this is not suitable for young teenagers. I have my doubts about whether it would have attracted an '18' had it been released now, however. There's something of a 'cult status' about the feel of this movie, whatever that really means. I was lucky enough to buy it for Â£10 on DVD. It's been nagging me to get it ever since I bought a DVD player. Kurt Russell has never been better; the rest of the cast are good; and the suspense from each character's mistrust of the other is something which is missing from most recent horror movies. John Carpenter, in those days, knew how to get an audience on the edge of their seats. This is not quite as good as 'Aliens' (in my view the ultimate in alien-horror movies) but it's a great movie to watch when you want a rush of adrenalin for sheer gut-churning visions.",Null,0,1,21 March 2002
The Village," Talk About Red Herrings
","This was a fair idea. A good cast, on the face of it. And the would-be-king of twists. So where did it all go wrong? Well, there's no faulting James Newton-Howard's music, which helped the film along. The sets and scenery reminded me of 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Blair Witch Project' (the latter film being awful, in my opinion) but the direction left me giggling. Supposedly meaningful shots of rocking-chairs. If this meant anything and I'm dumb, put me out of my misery. The worst of it is the acting, with the exception of the blind girl, although even she has to be given one of the worst, last lines in movie history. Mr Pheonix seems to be convincing enough, but he is confined to a horizontal position for the last half of the movie. Did he 'do' an Oliver Reed or David Hemmings and they couldn't find a double? Sigourney Weaver is good as always but she is hardly in the storyline. Brendan Gleeson plays his usual part. William Hurt, behind a bushy beard, may have insisted on 95% of his shots being side-on, presumably because he couldn't stop laughing at his atrocious dialogue. But the most hilarious performance comes from Adrien Brody. I didn't see 'The Pianist' but I'll bet he's glad he's already won an Oscar, because if he gets another part, it will probably be as a stage warm-up act for Woody Allen. It's almost worth seeing again to really have a good laugh. I think this movie is even worse than 'Unbreakable' and I haven't seen 'Signs' although people exiting the cinema were overheard to compare the two ('Signs' and this rubbish, that is). I still give it 5 out of 10 for some aspects, including the twists, the red herrrings, and the music. But the real reason I dislike this is that it is an obvious attempt at capturing the atmosphere of 'Sleepy Hollow', which it can never do. Sorry Mr S.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," What a way to go...
","Having not seen either of the first two movies at the cinema, I had to see this one, to make up for lost time. I don't think it is as good as the others, but it is as good as can be expected, considering the fact that the storyline had seemingly reached its end in 1991. There are some flat scenes, but these are far outnumbered by the terrific action sequences which make you just sit there in awe at the apparent real-life mayhem caused, particularly in the first set-piece, which must be one of the all-time great carnage spectacles, although I thought the crash in 'Final Destination 2' was pretty magnificent, too. Arnie is back with a vengeance, and somehow his acting, although still very much tongue in cheek, is quite good here. The grown-up John Connor is OK, and Claire Danes is adequately effective, if in the Ist Division to Linda Hamilton's Premier one. However, the main attraction here is the beautifully evil and totally believable Katrianna Loken. Her screen presence is enormous, and she acts with such confidence that it all seems perfectly plausible that the next high-tech generation of Terminators would be women...after all, they are taking over the world, aren't they? The film is worth seeing for the amazing stunts, and to marvel at KL's beauty, which, literally, knocks you out. As I said, if she's the Terminator, what a way to go...",Null,0,0,2 August 2003
Spider-Man," Spinning a web, not a yarn
","Whilst I enjoyed Spider-Man, I, like some other reviewers, was a bit disappointed, and I don't think it's as good as some are giving credit for. For instance, I thought the Star Wars movie was much better, in spite of atrocious dialogue. I had heard that there was a good story but there wasn't. It needed more plot and I fear that the follow-ups could be flops if the storylines aren't improved. I have no qualms about the cast, because they were all perfect, especially Tobey Maguire in the title role, but then I knew he was a star in the wings beforehand. Dafoe was actually more recognisable as the Green Goblin than he was in 'Shadow of the Vampire'if indeed it were he behind that ridiculous metal mask. In my view, the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst was totally wasted in this part. Just when I thought she was shedding the teen image behind her, along comes this character she was playing four years ago. She did an adequate job, but this role is just going to chain her as an evergreen teen, which would be a pity. My real gripe is that red hair. Now, listen here, Kirsten, you are one of the most fabulous blondes on the planet, and I don't like you with red hair! Can MJ take a leaf out of Reese Witherspoon's book, and 'go blonde' for the sequel? (Sorry, Reese, I know you are a real blonde.) This is the best comic book film I've seen for ages but it's nowhere near up to the first 2 Superman movies, which had those 'moments' to treasure. There are some good moments, but overall, the movie is not memorable.",Null,0,0,18 June 2002
Aliens," GOING BACKWARDS
","I write this review, on the eve of attending the cinema to watch 'Alien: The Director's Cut'. I have watched 'Aliens' maybe twenty times over the years, but somehow I've never seen the original all the way through, and certainly never at the cinema. Therefore, I am worried that I will think the original is better, in which case I wanted to be able, at least for tonight, to state quite categorically, that 'Aliens' is easily my favourite science fiction movie of all time. Should the original exceed all expectations, at least 'Aliens' will have temporary justice. I don't really understand why 'Aliens' is just so watchable time and again. Maybe James Cameron is a genius, because I do find all of his films obsessive. (I certainly prefer him as a director to Ridley Scott, so I'm not really expecting the original to surpass the sequel!) Maybe it's because the tension is so well staged. Maybe it's the relationship between Sigourney Weaver and 'Newt'. There are so many elements of this movie which make it stand out. Vasquez and Hudson are the most interesting crew members, although the android, played so convincingly by Lance Henriksen, deserves such credit for their mission. Whatever it is, this movie deserves to be held in God-like regard. It also contains the greatest line in movie history, in my opinion. Every time I see that scene, when Ripley disappears to become the human forklift and emerges with those immortal words to the Queen Alien, who is terrorising Newt, I am reminded of how great a film it is.With adrenaline pumping, and armed with those basic, and thankfully,  human traits of bravery and child protection, Ripley issues the command of 'Get away from her, you bitch!' Simple, but words which never fail to make you want her to kick the **** out of old Queenie. 9/10. If the original is better, I'll be posting that review tomorrow...",Null,0,0,31 October 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Not bad but...
","Overall, I rate this movie as quite good. But no more. It seemed to lack a bit of sparkle in the female department. I mean, where were they? Glamour could have figured a bit more, couldn't it? If 'Gone in 60 Seconds' can have Angelina Jolie, couldn't we have had one or two women in the 'gang'? I liked the cast, but if this movie had been made 30 years ago, the likes of Newman and McQueen would have insisted on a greater female presence, I'm sure. And the soundtrack. Where was it? It needed an injection of music and glitz to really get it going. Apart from these side issues, I enjoyed it, but couldn't help feeling that it could have been so much more, with the ingredients on show. The highlight had to be the 'outtake', if that's what it was originally, between Clooney and Pitt. I'd like to think that it was an ad-lib which they left in. Hopefully, they'll team up again, with a few more glamorous women. Sorry, Julia, but you're not in my top 20!",Null,0,1,26 February 2002
Blue Crush," I've got a crush on you

Just the elements alone can chill your nut-huggers and make you want to skip swimming lessons - permanently. Unless of course your instructress happens to be Kate Bosworth, who has a gorgeous blue eye. Just one. But that's enough. She's got two eyes, but the other one isn't blue. Who's counting anyway? I have to admit that she was the only reason I wanted to see this film, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The surfing sequences were brilliant, and the waves genuine and awesome.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Greatest Con Trick of the Age of Cinema
","Now I quite enjoyed 'Fellowship of the Ring'. I only saw it twice because I took my son the second time, but I have seen 'The Two Towers' only once, and am only likely to see it once. I was conned by the initial charm of the first film, but by the time of this second epic, the novelty has worn off for me. Now I understand why they only make Bond films every two or three years. One year was not enough distance to put between films like this, and the fact that they made all three at the same time also doesn't help. I know it's a trilogy but how many years were there between the three Godfather movies? Obviously the vast majority of punters totally disagree with me, but I see that the next Harry Potter movie will not be shown until 2004, which is sensible. Even that follow-up seemed too hot on the heels of the first film, but they've got an excuse. The actors will age. I don't really see the same problem arising with 'Rings' so there's no excuse. Anyway, at the end of the day, I would say that this movie in particular is vastly over-rated. I hate the way that Liv Ullman is on so many advertising posters and yet her role is so miniscule, if you blink you'll miss her. I was not particularly impressed by the battle scenes, because I'm not a great fan of CG effects. If you compare it to 'Zulu' it pales in comparison. I doubt if I will bother with the final instalment because these movies all have the same problem. They have to decide whether to take themselves fully seriously; or just be more fun. This film is neither gripping realism nor fulfilling fantasy. It's caught in the middle, with Gollom becoming not frightening enough to look like something from a Gothic vampire movie; and not pleasant enough to become your buddy. A disappointment. For trees with attitude, I'll stick to Macbeth or the 'Wizard of Oz' thank you very much....",Null,0,0,1 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," A Magnificent mess!
","So, does a magnificent mess mean that it's good or bad? I wrote the words and even I'm still not sure about it. On the one hand I think it will win Oscars; on the other, I feel I could tear it apart. At least it's different. And I did like Kylie Minogue's minute on screen - what a good Tinker Bell she would have made. I'm not going to say anything constructive, clever, or scathing about 'Moulin Rouge'. I feel it is a film that people should see, to make up their own mind, as at least it's not a sequel, and it is different from the run-of-the-windmill stuff. I just hope Nicole Kidman gets best actress for this. At the same time, I think Ewan McGregor is a good ObiWanKenobi.",Null,0,0,10 September 2001
Mulholland Drive," Critics should be lynched
","A great film, which totally brought back 'Twin Peaks' to me, one of my favourite shows of all time. I have missed all of Lynch's work in between, due to circumstances not beyond my control, and how I've missed his style. I would still rate Sherilyn Fenn's cherry scene as the most horny I've seen, but there are one or two episodes in 'MD' which were definitely erotic. I'm not going to attempt to decipher the plot, although reading other reviews afterwards did make it make more sense. The two female leads mesmerised me, especially Naomi Watts, who was totally convincing. I hope that the DVD will follow in these stylish footsteps.",Null,1,2,31 January 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Needs the Cinema
","I bought this DVD a year ago and I've just watched it. How I wish I had seen it in the movie theatre but for some reason I didn't. Everything I've heard about this movie is true, as I have never previously watched it anywhere. It is slow. It is thought-provoking. It does have awesome effects and seeing those, you can't help feeling that you're being a bit cheated 34 years on, when you see quite poor computer-generated effects in films such as 'Minority Report' which I otherwise enjoyed.'2001' is bound to be slow at home, but in the cinema I would just have been able to savour its momentous impact. I am a great believer in films being seen at the cinema and feel that a return to the days when movies were regularly re-issued (always in double-bills as well) would go a long way in rejuvenating the art. The guy who invented moving pictures didn't have someone's sitting-room in mind. A large auditorium is the only venue whereby a film such as this can fully be appreciated. As an artform this film must have few equals. Personally, give me 'Aliens' any day as a space epic, but I was definitely not disappointed. And, finally, how can this attract a 'U' certificate?! It scared the pants off me! Perhaps those censorship guys can't censor pure imagination. Or maybe they haven't got any.",Null,0,2,29 July 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Do Great Spotless Minds Think Alike?
","Perhaps they do, because, without giving anything away, there are two examples in this film of exactly that. Or am I really referring to lightning striking twice, or history repeating itself...I'm not too sure, and it's sure hard to write a review of this without giving anything away. I have had to watch ESOTSM three times before writing this, because it took me that long to decide if I really liked it, and one viewing, unless you're cleverer than me, does not make total sense of it all. Guess what. I really liked it. Having not seen 'Adaptation' or 'being John Malkovich', I was new to the script-writer, but anything as fresh and original as this will always get my vote. This is almost 'Sliding Doors' meets 'Memento', but it's not anything like either of those films in either style or story, really. But there are some similarities. I was surprised at the size of the audiences because I fully expected the cinema-going masses to give this a miss. This is no ordinary Jim Carrey movie, although I have not seen his previous 'serious' films. This is still amusing, though, in a gentler kind of way. He shines, although is ultimately out-acted by the brilliant Kate Winslet, who is on fantastic form here. She really doesn't make enough movies, and it was great to see her in another great film (I'm counting 'Titanic' and 'Enigma' as the others), especially following the dire 'Life of David Gale'. The supporting cast are good, although Tom Wilkinson is forever etched in my brain now as the 'villain' from 'Girl With A Pearl Earring', in which he was terrific. Finally, in the cast department, a mention for Kirsten Dunst. She injects life into the middle of this movie, just when it almost threatens to peter out slightly. But save it she does. Just how good is ESOTSM? Ask me after I've watched it another 3 times. Justifies its top 50 in the IMDB list, in my view. Not sure beyond that. My one criticism, as I always try to think of one, is that there could perhaps have been more urgency inside Carrey's mind, to increase the tension. But it's not a thriller, so it doesn't matter anyway. Defies categorisation really. But then again all the best films are. ('Donnie Darko' is another case in point.) 8 out of 10 - for now. Not to be missed, that's for sure. Don't kill bill - make a date with Kate.",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
From Hell," From Hell Without Suspense
","This movie reminds me of the impact created by 'The Others'. It's difficult to fault the mood, tone, feel, and acting.(I did not have a problem with the Cockney accents). Yet, in spite of the lack of grounds for criticism, I didn't think it was as good as I was hoping. Like 'Hannibal', another suitably gory story, it lacked suspense. Even where the story is known, suspense should still be created, but I thought that the early murders were clumsily handled. The film looks good, and the music was complimentary, but somehow it lacked that vital ingredient. Mind you, what do I know - I thought the 'Glass House' was a taut thriller, whereas most critics slammed it. To me, it was almost as if Johnny Depp KNEW that it lacked a spark. As always, he was very watchable, but his performance was not as compelling as usual. I don't think his heart was in it. Did he need Christina Ricci playing the part of Mary Kelly? I'm willing to bet that if she had, 'From Hell' would have packed a bigger punch. Heather Graham is just too nice to play a salt-of-the-earth prostitute. Christina Ricci would have had that edge in the part, and Depp would then have excelled. Robbie Coltrane was underused, but helped matters when he was on screen. Overall, I enjoyed it, but if it had to be an '18' certificate, I think that the menace could have been better employed by more graphic violence, to engineer in the audience an uneasy suspense, which it definitely lacked.",Null,2,3,17 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Thanks to Chris Columbus, the world is not square at all!
","It is a poorer world without books. When I went to see 'HPATPS' none 0f my family had read more than a few pages of any of JK Rowling's books. I had tried in vain to persuade my two children to become interested in reading. So, I thought, the film may do the trick, and it may just have done that. They are actually threatening to READ it now. Phew! I may even have a go myself. I suspected that the four of us were in a minority in the cinema, not knowing hardly anything about the story. The hype suggested that those 'not in the know' would struggle to follow the opening 30 minutes. I have to report that this warning was superfluos as we all seemed to know exactly what was happening! The money was obviously well spent, and, although I am not a lover of computer effects, they were handled sensitively and sensibly.Dare I suggest that the story did seem to slightly drag in the middle somewhere, but it was always entertaining, because of the fact that everything was wonderful to look at. The fine cast were great, although I kept expecting Alan Rickman to 'let rip', until the end, when I realised why he hadn't! It is the three children, however, who outshone Britain's Best. All 3 are magnificent in their roles, especially Emma Watson, who stole the film for me. My thanks to the director, who, if this film does prompt my children to read, will have, like his namesake, have proved that the world really is round, and not square. Another good thing to come from this film is that the '12' certificate is completely unnecessary. If Harry Potter gets a 'PG' then I can't think of another '12' film I've seen which does not deserve likewise. This was scary at times. Good for the censors, but they really should assess all films consistently.",Null,0,0,18 November 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," 'It's a Wonderful Life' defines the word 'escapism'
","I have never met anyone who does not treasure this film, and if I ever do, I will truly feel extremely sorry for them. I believe that this is the greatest movie ever made. It stands head and shoulders above anything else I've ever seen. It's not simply the best movie, but also an amazing lesson in what life is all about, especially for those of us who sometimes have to ask ourselves that question. Although the entire cast is strong, it is James Stewart's finest hour. I remember an interview with him some years ago, in which he said that, to him, a good movie was all about 'moments'. He recalled the scene, in Martini's bar, where he says a prayer. This is my favourite scene in the movie, and is just one of the many such 'moments'. If ever I'm not sure whether I really liked a film or not, I can usually work out the answer by this 'moments' theory. Unfortunately, few movies can deliver the goods, and none match Frank Capra's masterpiece. 10 out of 10 does not tell the whole story. My advice to anyone who has not seen this film, is make sure you do see it before you die - it may even prolong your life!",Null,0,6,17 September 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A very moving experience
","I watched this movie after it won 4 Oscars, but I would have seen it anyway, I think. I had possibly avoided it because of the subject matter, in that, whilst not being scizophrenic, I have endured my own mental problems in my time. The Oscar ceremony persuaded me to see what all the fuss was about. I am so glad that I made that decision. I am very relieved it beat the likes of 'Moulin Rouge' and 'The Lord of the Rings' for, although I thought that both of those films were good, neither deserved to be considered as 'best film'. Personally, 'Amelie' was my favourite film of the year, but 'A Beautiful Mind' has to be the best film. I was quite shocked by the depth of Russell Crowe's talent. It's a shame he won the Oscar last year - I thought Tom Hanks should have won for 'Castaway'. Had he not done so, I'm sure he would have scooped the award this year. I've not seen 'Training Day' but this role demanded acting on many different levels. Crowe dominates the film with his performance; the perfect contrast of the brains versus the brawn of 'Gladiator'. Actually, if anything, I think his menacing thug-cop in 'LA Confidential' was a better performance than in 'Gladiator'. Anyway, apart from Crowe, I cannot fathom why Jennifer Connely did not win a Best Actress Oscar. Is there a screen time presence rule? If not, I feel she should have won in that category. I haven't previously particularly liked Ron Howard films, and I thought 'The Grinch' was pretty dire, but his direction is perfect here. It may not be totally factually accurate but it made for great film-making. For a while, whilst on a 'high' leaving the cinema, I couldn't think of a better movie. 9/10.",9,0,2,31 March 2002
30 Days of Night," A comedy, right?
","I cannot believe the reviews I have seen for this. This was pretty awful at best. I must have seen the wrong movie because if this is popular then movie standards must have plummeted lately. Josh Hartnett picks turkeys like Bernard Matthews. He is actually the breast and feathers in this one. I found almost all of the cast on the verge of hysterical laughter, which killed any chance for me enjoying it. had it been deliberately played for laughs I might have succumbed. Only the vampires were convincing. They were much more serious. Not since William Hurt, hiding his embarrassment behind a beard in 'The Village', has an actor looked more like falling about in hysteria, as Hartnett does in this, again helped by a bit of a beard. Who wrote the wonderful script? Every time the survivors moved their base, it was announced they had to leave again. Did large segments get abandoned on the cutting room floor? I would have left it all, actually. Regarding the dialogue, only the vampires' strange lingo was anything like convincing. The rest of the script was pure comedy. Finally, in spite of the extensive gore, I was not once concerned about any of the characters because there was not a single scrap of tension or suspense. it made 'Dog Soldiers' and even the dreadful 'Underworld' seem passable.",3,5,13,7 November 2007
Inception," The Greatest Movie of all Time
","'Inception' is a cinematic experience without rival. I have seen it, so far, 10 times at the cinema and I can't wait to go again. What I shall do when the theatres all stop screening it, I simply don't know. It gets better and better the more times you see it. Part of this is because it all makes more sense each time it's viewed, but mainly it is because the combination of a lot of individual parts keeps you enthralled and intrigued from start to finish. The direction, original script, ensemble cast, and terrific music all add up to cinematic heaven. I am not even going to begin to mention any of the plot as it can't be appreciated without viewing. The cast are all good. Di Caprio has never been better, although the highly watchable Ellen Page and the mesmerising performance of Marion Cotillard really steal the show between the three of them. Many people I know would probably be put off by the fact that it is both a 'summer blockbuster' and a science fiction film. But it is so very much more than that. I liked the Director's second movie 'Memento' but this is far beyond expectations. His own story is scripted magnificently. I truly feel that, in the current trend of singalong movies such as 'Grease', this should become a candidate for a talkalong, as it is wonderful to talk along to the script yourself! (Obviously mouthing, not speaking, the words!). I hope and pray that it becomes the number one movie in the IMDb list. Currently standing at Number Four, it is definitely worthy of such a status.",10,1,9,10 September 2010
Identity," So close to having one...
","This is the kind of film you could easily praise highly or slag off just as easily. It's that kind of movie. All the reviews show this. That's, in effect, what probably (!) puts it in the first category for me. So close to having one...is something people who have seen the movie will 'get' but I'm not going to throw in spoilers by explaining what I mean. You'll have to watch it to find out for yourself. The movie is atmospheric yet somewhat predictable. But it's also run-of-the-mill, yet surprising! I know, doesn't make any sense. For British viewers, the catchphrase of 'Blankety Blank' was 'the clue is in the question'. Say no more. I didn't wholly like it because I am not a huge fan of Ray Liotta, who I feel is over-rated. And I was upset because one of my blonde heroines, Rebecca DeMornay, wasn't blonde; but, those points aside,I do recommend it, especially if you know very little about it in advance. On the plus side, I thought John Cusack was excellent, and Amanda Peet extremely, shall we say, 'watchable'. This is not a horror movie as such. Nor was 'The Ring' but that doesn't mean that they're not creepy. This is not as good as 'The Ring' which was mind-blowingly terrifying, thanks, mainly, to the magnificent Naomi Watts, but 'Identity' has enough going for it to demand attention. It's got mine twice so far, and I feel a third trip could be just around the corner. For those looking for simple twists like that of 'The Sixth Sense', then this is not really for them. I disagree with many other reviewers who claim that this twist appears too early in the movie. A movie is greater than its twist alone, and sometimes a late twist is as unsatisfying as an early one. I would have preferred 'The Others' a whole lot more if the plot had developed a bit more after its revelation right at the death, if you'll pardon the pun.

Amélie," Angelique Audrey mesmerises as Amelie
","I am not someone who watches foreign language films very often. This is obviously my great loss and shame. 'Amelie' is the second such film I've seen this year. All I can say is, if 'Crouching Tiger' won Oscars, then this should too. It's far superior, in my opinion, to last year's surprise Oscar-scooper, and it was every bit as good as I had expected. I didn't find it too long at all. In fact I didn't want it to end. I don't know where they found Audrey Tautou, but she must be the greatest discovery of the century! Everything else about the film is good, too, (I especially liked the gnome) but it's impossible to forget Amelie herself, with whom I, amazingly, identified. I've never been to France. I certainly want to go now. If I could take 10 films to a desert island (preferably with the means to watch them) Amelie would definitely be there. 9/10. If Hollywood doesn't pull its socks up, I'm going to be fully converted soon. An utter gem.",10,1,3,25 October 2001
Donnie Darko," Harvey Skybanger
","Definitely obscure interesting and offbeat, a cross between 'Harvey', David Lynch material, and a mind-blowing cocktail, 'DD' is worth the effort, but is not quite the ride it's made out to be by other reviewers. It is 7 out of 10; very good, but does lose its way a little, after a good start and before an intriguing, even haunting, conclusion. I must confess I didn't fully understand what it was all about, but the fact that it makes you think about the possibilities of time travel, and the facts of death and schizophrenia, make it thought-provoking enough to stay with you for a long time. The 80s music, although not my favourite era, was perfectly toned for the events taking place, and the finale of 'Mad World'as the film reached its conclusion was one of the most memorable moments in recent cinema. On the plus side, I thought most of the acting was credible. On the minus side, there's Patrick Swayze. Although well-cast, he is sickeningly revolting! A film worth seeing twice, but not in the same league as 'Mulholland Drive' for sheer weirdness...",Null,3,4,14 December 2002
