Saturday Night Fever," Saturday Night Fever irrevocably changed music films and pop culture.
","Italian roughnecks in Brooklyn live for their Saturday night disco dancing, and one of them (John Travolta) falls in love with a girl (Karen Lynn Gorney) who makes him realize there are better things in life.Saturday Night Fever is a foul-mouthed, fast-paced slice of life which made a film star of Travolta, a terrific dancer. It capitalised on, and indeed reinforced the disco boom. It was a phenomenal box-office success that despite some of its flaws - its minor characters are not well sketched, and Tony Manero isn't exactly multi-dimensional - seemed entirely predictable. The film's soundtrack, featuring disco songs by the Bee Gees, is the second best selling soundtrack of all time.",10,0,3,2 September 2010
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," This is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.
","National Treasure: Book Of Secrets really entertains. I wasn't expecting much from this film, but it turns out to be better than the first National Treasure. The treasure hunt, though not believable, is gripping. There's also some effective humour added in. Nicolas Cage, who's just one of Hollywood's best actors, is as reliable as ever in the main role of Ben Gates. I don't know what it is about him, but he always manages to be interesting when on screen.On the downside the film is a Hollywood product. This just isn't great film-making. John Voight and newcomer Helen Mirren are just there for the money. Diane Kruger is nothing but a pretty face, and Ed Harris (who's the villain for most of the film) doesn't have much to do. Still, like I mentioned earlier Book Of Secrets is very entertaining (especially in the second half). I just couldn't stop watching it. It's better than that odd bore Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. Book Of Secrets is a good family film, and I recommend it.",6,2,5,27 April 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin Tarantino's sprawling homage to action films of both the East and the West reaches its conclusion.
","The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her revenge against her ex-boss (David Carradine) and his two surviving henchmen (Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah).Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a much baggier production than Vol. 1, in which attempts at thoughtfulness and deeper characterisation fall dismayingly flat. There are good moments, but when this rampage stops roaring, it reveals itself as a bit of a sham. At the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, Vol. 2 was nominated for best film, Thurman was nominated for best female performance, and the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver won Best Fight.",8,1,2,6 July 2010
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Just as well-made as Catching Fire. Another solid entry in the series.
","I wasn't excited to see this film. That's because I've read all three Hunger Games books by author Suzanne Collins, and I knew that the first part of Mockingjay includes very little action. Still, I like what director Francis Lawrence did with Catching Fire (2013) so, when I had the time, I watched Mockingjay - Part 1. This was over a month after it was released in theaters. I have to say that I was again impressed by what Lawrence and producer Nina Jacobson managed to do. Mockingjay - Part 1 is not a dull film. In fact, it's quite entertaining. In my opinion, director Lawrence should get most of the credit. Together with the producers he once again made a thrilling and well-paced film in which not one scene is wasted. Parts of the film can even be called inspired. The actors also did a good job. I don't think that there's one performance that stood out for me but every actor was solid. This time Josh Hutcherson, playing Peeta Mellark, managed to pull off a good performance. It's particularly effective during the Capitol television interviews. In my previous reviews I mentioned that Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have the looks to play Katniss Everdeen. But I admit that she really is a good actress, and for this film she delivered her best Katniss performance yet. But it's Donald Sutherland, the master actor, who continues to impress the most as Coriolanus Snow. The way he speaks and his facial expressions are mesmerizing. He makes every second count, and in the bleak offering that is Mockingjay - Part 1 he is particularly memorable. Of course, this film is a Hollywood product, even if it is very well-made. It also doesn't leave a lasting impression on viewers, which is the big reason why reviewers didn't like it as much as, for example, Catching Fire. There's no big payoff or struggle at the end of the film. It can only be viewed as the first part of a larger film. But I still recommend it. The film's marketing campaign made me interested, and when I watched Mockingjay - Part 1 I wasn't disappointed at all.",8,0,7,3 March 2015
Vertigo," Vertigo has come to be considered Hitchcock's greatest film for its complex examination of romantic pathology.
","The film received mixed reviews upon initial release, but has garnered much acclaim since then and is now frequently ranked among the greatest films ever made, and often cited as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. A detective with a fear of heights (James Stewart) is drawn into a complex plot in which a girl he loves (Kim Novak) apparently falls to her death. Then he meets her double.Vertigo is a double identity thriller which has many sequences in director Alfred Hitchcock's best style. A film as unsettling as the phobia it deals with, keeping its audience dizzy and off balance throughout. This ranks among his very best work.",10,2,5,5 June 2010
Men in Black 3," A fantastic summer movie with a heart.
","After a sequel like Men In Black 2 (2002) I wasn't looking forward to watching the third film. Men In Black (1997) is one of the must-see films of the 1990s, but the third film was released 15 years later. Most people know that sequels are usually disappointing. However, Men In Black 3 is a thrilling science fiction comedy. This one runs on a full tank of gas, and in my opinion it's a little better than the original. Will Smith hasn't been in a film for four years after the poorly received Seven Pounds (2008). Here it's good to see him again as Agent J, who has to travel back in time. An additional treat is that there are two wonderful supporting characters, Josh Brolin as Agent K and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin. The humor comes often and not only because Brolin is so effective in his role. Yes, Tommy Lee Jones is still here. The setups are funny; one of the best being what happens at the factory. The imaginative action scenes are exciting too. Jemaine Clement, playing Boris the Animal, is a terrific alien villain with creepy crawly things that just have to be seen. Most of the credit should go to director Barry Sonnenfeld and screenwriter Etan Cohen. Cohen wrote the best screenplay of any of the Men In Black films while Sonnenfeld provided the film with a vision. Sure, the first twenty minutes are entertaining but they're spent mostly on finding a footing. After that though the film is a blast. It's a touching as well as action-packed experience. I definitely recommend it.",7,0,1,19 March 2013
Scarface," Infinitely quotable and more than a little cartoonish.
","The film chronicles the rise and fall of Cuban immigrant Tony Montana (Al Pacino), who becomes a big-time drug dealer.Scarface is a brutalized remake, with detailed violence and a superabundance of foul language; yet Pacino is mesmerising, and Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer both lend first-rate support. Miami, superbly photographed, looks all too likely a location for such nefarious dealings. With this film, director Brian De Palma made a shocking statement about the advanced state of the narcotics trade in America's cities. The film has gathered a cult following and has become an important cultural icon, inspiring posters, clothing, and many other references.",8,0,1,10 July 2010
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Baron Cohen hits the road to explore America as the crude Kazakh reporter in this feature mockumentary.
","In this spoof, Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen), a Kazakh TV presenter, is ordered by his government to travel to the US and report on its way of life. He interviews Americans about feminism, sex, etiquette, humour, politics and religion. He also falls for Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, who he tries to kidnap.Borat has a clever premise, with a straight-faced, apparently naive foreigner coaxing outrageous, embarrassing comments from innocent, well-meaning Americans not in on the gag. Yet the film trades on gross-out humour, and picks on easy targets: evangelical Christians, rodeo rednecks, unsmiling feminists. Essentially, this is Candid Camera - with the unwelcome addition of anti-Semetic jokes. One wonders at Baron Cohen's motives: is this a smug in-joke, a tilt at political correctness, or a cynical attempt to shock? Exasperatingly, it's a little bit of all three. The film was criticized by the Kazakhstan government, Jewish and gypsy groups.",9,0,1,5 July 2010
The Incredible Hulk," This dramatic and rousing film features the Hulk that everyone knows and loves.
","When The Incredible Hulk came out back in 2008 I watched it in a movie theater. I remember thinking that this is the best film portrayal of the Hulk yet. It's by no means a perfect film but it gets a number of things right. It definitely has replay value. Casting Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was a curious but inspired move. Norton is a good actor. In this film his Banner is a likable and charismatic character from the beginning. This reluctant hero gets a dramatic treatment like never before in film. In addition to the well-handled romance between Banner and Betty Ross (a perfectly cast Liv Tyler) we're also shown how he relates to his work. Since this is a beginnings story Banner can't yet control the Hulk and he wants to rid himself of the green monster. This drags down the action scenes a bit because the Hulk fights against Thunderbolt Ross' (William Hurt) army units. It's not very exciting stuff because he isn't facing a supervillain. So he smashes some armored cars and brings down a chopper. Only at the end of the film do we get to see some real Hulk action when he faces Emil Blonsky. But, surprisingly, the action involving the Hulk isn't even the best aspect of this film. It's more interesting to see Norton play Banner while he's on the run from Ross. The inclusion of some good natured humor is also a plus. Hurt lent an air of respectability to the film in his role as General Ross just as Jeff Bridges did in Iron Man (2008). It's unfortunate that Norton didn't get to reprise his role as Banner in The Avengers (2012) because he made Banner a believable character. In The Avengers Banner is often used for comic relief while the Hulk is used only for action. Sure, the fight featuring the Hulk and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is exciting. But when written by Joss Whedon and played by Mark Ruffalo Banner has none of the mystery and charisma that Norton brought to the role. Norton said that his dispute with Marvel producers was about money, while Kevin Feige claimed that they didn't get along with Norton. Perhaps Norton disagreed with Whedon's comical take on the character, or perhaps Feige thought that the box office returns were below expectations and decided not to spend more time and effort on Hulk films. It's too bad because out of all the Marvel superheroes I was most excited about seeing the Hulk. The Incredible Hulk achieved what it set out to do. Norton and director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, Now You See Me) successfully revived the character and did it in a smart way. The CGI was provided by Rhythm And Hues and not by Industrial Light & Magic, the company that created the visual effects for Ang Lee's Hulk (2003). They succeeded in making the Hulk a vivid on-screen presence. Craig Armstrong provided a memorable music score, and if you want to get it it's available on two discs. There's a significant amount of footage that wasn't included in the final cut of the film. For example, the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide was cut out. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Some of the flashbacks that were placed across the film were compressed to the film's start. I would have liked seeing these in the final cut though. I recommend The Incredible Hulk. It's one of my favorite Marvel Studios films.",7,0,1,10 July 2014
Requiem for a Dream," Requiem For A Dream is one of the most visceral depictions of addiction ever put on film.
","Requiem For A Dream is not for the faint-hearted. It's brutal, stark, stomach-churning and unglamorous. It depicts different forms of addiction, leading to the characters' imprisonment in a dream world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality.The film is a bleak drama about four wasted lives, shot in a manner that mirrors their alienation and despair. Craftsmanlike, and a laudable attempt to extend the grammar of film, but one feels cornered by its pervasive hopelessness. Still, the wonderful performances and the bleak imagery are hard to forget. The soundtrack has been widely praised and has subsequently been used in various forms in trailers for other films and series.",7,0,1,7 December 2009
The Equalizer," Watching The Equalizer is almost like watching the Iraq War.
","The Equalizer is one very brutal film. There's hardly any humor in it and, at times, it's violent in the extreme. It's definitely not something that you should watch with your girlfriend because it deals with prostitution, corruption, murder, loss and the underworld. If The Equalizer didn't contain any action it would have been a truly depressing and unpleasant viewing experience. I guess the only reason to see this film is Denzel Washington, who plays Robert McCall. One can think of The Equalizer as a superhero movie because of its break with reality and McCall's ability to kill people in impressive and often ridiculous ways. McCall also has a knack for avoiding injury and he deals with the bad guys mostly at night. There are attempts in Richard Wenk's screenplay to develop the characters but they don't go far, and the result is a simple fight of good against evil. The mobsters are mostly clichés, their victims are clichés, and the only thing that McCall has to decide is whether or not he should again become the unstoppable killing machine that he was before. The gruesome and violent action scenes manage to entertain because of Washington's slow-burn, perfectly modulated performance. It's just shootouts and fights. There's nothing new or original about them even if they are expertly staged. As the film moves along it gets more and more ridiculous, going from McCall wanting to help a brutalized girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) to McCall taking on almost the whole mafia underworld, foreign and domestic. The Equalizer is no Lethal Weapon (1987) or Die Hard (1988). It's more like Death Wish (1974). The film isn't really entertaining but it can be compelling, especially when the mobsters try to find McCall and take him down. I don't recommend The Equalizer because it's not much of a thriller and it's not much of an action movie. It has its moments but it's predictable, brutal and mostly forgettable.",6,1,4,29 October 2014
Iron Man 3," An electrifying but provocative comic-book film.
","Iron Man 3 is another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's somewhat different from the two Iron Man films before because Shane Black replaced Jon Favreau as director. Favreau's influence on the film is evident, and he appears in his role as Happy Hogan, now Stark Industries head of security. Iron Man 3 offers just as much popcorn entertainment as Favreau's efforts. It's a more interesting film than Iron Man 2 (2010) because Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has to rely on his smarts and innovation instead of his firepower as he faces forces beyond his control. Iron Man 2 is a solid, enjoyable sequel but it was a bit of a letdown after Iron Man (2008). In Iron Man 3 the screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce takes unexpected turns for a superhero movie. Purists may be upset by the changes from the comic books, but the surprises are actually neat. The big reason why this works is because the new actors, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, James Badge Dale, Ty Simpkins and Stephanie Szostak, deliver memorable performances. Downey, Jr. is as good as ever, and he handles the humor just as well as in the terrific crime-comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). But Shane Black didn't bring only his clever comedy to Iron Man 3. He maintained the series' playful tone without neglecting Stark's struggle. He also delivered spectacular action set pieces in which Iron Man gets to put his abilities to good use, like in the dizzying action sequence involving Air Force One. Iron Man 3 is definitely the funniest Marvel film yet, but the drama involving Extremis is no less effective. The visual effects for the film were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. Thanks to the excellent CGI we get to see the good-looking suits that Tony Stark has been working on. After the events of The Avengers (2012) he didn't spend all his time brooding because of his posttraumatic stress disorder. Brian Tyler contributed a good, bombastic music score for Iron Man 3. It features a memorable theme, and works well with the drama of the film too. I've seen all the Marvel films in a theater and, just like all of them, Iron Man 3 wasn't a letdown. The action, the comedy, the drama, the acting, and simply the intelligence of these films always make them enjoyable. Producer Kevin Feige was influenced by RoboCop (1987), something that makes it clear what his formula is. I definitely recommend Iron Man 3. It's a strong finish to a good trilogy.",8,15,24,30 May 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the most unabashedly enjoyable cinematic events of the 1980s.
","In the 1930s, an American archaeologist and explorer (Harrison Ford) beats the Nazis to a priceless artifact, the magical box containing fragments of the stones on which God wrote his laws.Raiders Of The Lost Ark was commercially very successful, this attempted wrap-up of pre-war Saturday morning serials spends a great deal of money and expertise on frightening rather than exciting us. Second time around, one can better enjoy the ingenious detail of the hero's exploits; still, there are boring bits in between, and the story doesn't make a lot of sense. Yet this was the genesis of the modern action-adventure blockbuster for all the family, and few of its successors have a fraction of its wit, verve or sense of fun. In 1999, the film was deemed 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant' by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.",10,2,5,12 June 2010
Spartacus," While it suffers from some of the flaws of epics of this era, Spartacus also boasts some stirring action and intelligent dialogue.
","A gladiator (Kirk Douglas) in ancient Rome sparks a slaves' revolt. The documentary Trumbo suggests that the 'I am Spartacus!' scene was meant to dramatize the solidarity of those accused of being Communist sympathizers during the McCarthy Era who refused to implicate others, and thus were blacklisted.Spartacus is a long, well-made, downbeat epic, rather talky in its first half, but with deeper than usual characterization and several bravura sequences. This is about as good as the sword-and-sandals genre got in this era. The original score for the film was composed and conducted by six-time Academy Award nominee Alex North. It is considered one of his best works.",8,2,5,1 July 2010
United 93," Details with journalistic precision exactly what happened on the ground during the events of September 11, 2001.
","Passengers and crew on board a hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 unsuccessfully struggle with four terrorists to take control of the plane. Several family members of the passengers aboard the flight attended the film's premiere to show their support.United 93 is an astonishing documentary-style drama that tracks in scrupulous detail the known events on the ground and acts of bravery inside the doomed plane. Understandably, it is often painful to watch, but is never exploitative, and does justice to those who died on board. Director Paul Greengrass's decision to cast lesser-known actors, so as not to distract audiences with star sightings, proves impeccably correct.",9,3,5,4 July 2010
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Both a classic film for kids and a remarkable portrait of childhood.
","When an alien spacecraft is disturbed in a Los Angeles suburb, one of its crew members is left behind and befriends a small boy (Henry Thomas).E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial was a stupefyingly successful box-office fairy tale by director Steven Spielberg, many of whose family films work so brilliantly because he taps into the child-like sense of wonder that lies at the heart of everyone's earliest film-going experiences. This one could hardly be simpler, but it is literally unimprovable, and works at all levels for all audiences. The film was re-released in 1985, and then again in 2002 with altered special effects and additional scenes. Spielberg believes E.T. epitomizes his work.",10,1,3,27 June 2010
Casablanca," This captivating wartime adventure of romance and intrigue from director Michael Curtiz defies standard categorization.
","Rick Blaine's (Humphrey Bogart) cafe in Casablanca is a centre for war refugees awaiting visas for America. Rick abandons his cynicism to help an old flame (Ingrid Bergman) escape the Nazis with her husband (Paul Henreid), a heroic Resistance leader.Casablanca is cinema par excellence: a studio-bound Hollywood melodrama which after various chances just fell together impeccably into one of the outstanding entertainment experiences of cinema history, with romance, intrigue, excitement, suspense and humour cunningly deployed by master technicians and a perfect cast. Its characters, dialogue, and music have become iconic, and the film has grown in popularity to the point that it now consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time.",10,0,3,18 July 2010
Minority Report," An engaging walk on the safely Spielbergian dark side.
","Minority Report is director Steven Spielberg's sharpest, brawniest, most bustling entertainment since Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981). In the future, a police unit is dedicated to tracking down criminals before they commit their crimes. A cop (Tom Cruise) in the unit learns he himself is about to murder somebody.The film is another to add to the cinema's long list of almost-great works derived from Philip K. Dick novels: though it can't finally get round miscasting of a blankly heroic Cruise in the lead role, yet Spielberg displays tremendous technical mastery, and enough grasp of human frailty, to make this enthralling science-fiction.",8,0,1,14 September 2010
In Bruges," Shoot first. Sightsee later.
","In Bruges is moderately fair as a nutty character study, but overly far-fetched once the action kicks in. Two Irish hit men (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) get up to no good after being sent to the Belgian city of Bruges.The film is a darkly comic, scabrously witty farce that takes a puerile glee in being casually offensive. The result is great fun, until it starts taking itself seriously. But it's a laugh-out-loud dark comedy. In Bruges was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2009 but lost to Milk. In the same year, it won the Irish Film and Television Awards for Best International Film.",7,1,3,26 March 2012
John Wick," A faint echo of the past rather than an invigorating retro blast.
","I can't say I understand why many people are raving about John Wick. Is it that people's expectations are so low these days? Maybe it's because the film is reminiscent of The Matrix and because it features refreshing old-school action choreography. Sure, it seems like with the character of John Wick, Keanu Reeves is back to his glory days of Speed (1994) and The Matrix (1999). But this alone doesn't make for a good film. John Wick is an often enjoyable action movie, but there's nothing original about it. Gone are the days of bright upbeat action movies like Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987) and Under Siege (1992). Yes, those days seem so far away now. Today we have to watch dark, depressing and truly violent action movies like John Wick and The Equalizer. If you want to see action in an upbeat movie now you have to watch a special-effects summer blockbuster. But, to be fair, John Wick does contain some humor, the cinematography by Jonathan Sela is impressive, some of the action scenes are truly entertaining, and that movie poster of Keanu with a gun sure does look cool. In fact, sometimes the film reminds one of the glory days of action movies. Reeves is confident in the leading role. Michael Nyqvist seems to be enjoying himself as Viggo Tarasov, the film's main antagonist. In addition, most of the supporting cast are good, though there isn't a single character that I found interesting. Director and stunt veteran Chad Stahelski refuses to embrace the post-Bourne Identity (2002) trend of shaky-cam action. That's commendable but the action choreography is still unremarkable even if it is competent. John Wick can kill people without problems. If the character had been infused with more style, however, and provided with more of a personality the film would have been more enjoyable. Derek Kolstad's traditional and predictable screenplay also drags the film down. When Wick goes on his vengeful killing spree he begins with the pawns and works his way up to the head of the crime syndicate. So, even though John Wick is mostly a competent action movie, there's nothing in it that can elevate it to the status of a classic. I don't recommend it, but if you're in the mood to see an action movie you may like it.",5,6,28,3 November 2014
Chinatown," 'You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.'
","In 1937 Los Angeles, a grasping tycoon (John Huston) takes control of the city's water supply and causes a drought, while a private eye (Jack Nicholson) takes on a case involving the tycoon's daughter (Faye Dunaway), which entangles him in a major scandal.Chinatown is a brilliant mystery, written with an astute sense of narrative architecture and played to the hilt by a terrific cast, including Nicholson, who has never done better work than his portrayal of the insouciant Jake Gittes. It's a rare thriller, one that addresses itself to serious moral and public policy issues while remaining gripping, exciting and finally heartbreaking. In 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.'",10,7,12,11 May 2010
Gravity," An unforgettable experience for the eyes and the mind.
","Gravity is the kind of film that doesn't often get made in Hollywood. The film was shot in the United Kingdom and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Director Alfonso Cuaron manages to grab us from the beginning in this science-fiction thriller with majestic views of Earth from space. We get introduced to Dr. Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock, and Lieutenant Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney. The performances by Bullock and Clooney are both excellent. It's Bullock, however, who carries the film like an expert with a performance that makes her character sympathetic but also distant. Bullock is known both for her comedic roles (While You Were Sleeping, Demolition Man) and her dramatic roles (Speed, Crash). Gravity is very much an experience and the film should be seen in a theater. Cuaron combines drama and thrills for an emotionally satisfying result. The excellent visual effects may make some viewers wonder how they were achieved. They make us feel almost as if we're there in space with the characters. It's worth mentioning that Cuaron's work, and especially this film, has been influenced by director Elem Klimov's great 1985 war drama Come And See. If you watch both Gravity and Come And See you'll notice the striking similarities. In addition to Cuaron's expert direction and Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning cinematography we're also treated to an effective soundtrack by Steven Price, which works wonders in some scenes. Some reviewers ranked Gravity on the same level as science-fiction greats like Blade Runner (1982), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972). I'm not going to jump to such conclusions at this time, but Gravity is easily one of the best films of recent years. I certainly recommend it.",9,5,9,19 October 2013
The Big Lebowski," Mostly a series of bizarre vignettes, which might be a problem if they weren't so funny.
","Directors Joel and Ethan Coen have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler, who refers to himself as 'The Dude'.The Big Lebowski is a wide-eyed, one-of-a-kind comedy of genius, with the structure of a shaggy-dog Raymond Chandler pastiche. No surprise that it has ripened over the years and became a beloved cult favourite ('the first cult film of the Internet era'): it is the Coen Brothers' most exuberantly wacky and inventive film, but also their most affectionate and the performances are a joy. The film's devoted fans have spawned Lebowski Fest, an annual festival that started in Louisville, Kentucky in 2002 and has since expanded to several other cities.",8,1,6,22 December 2009
Fight Club," A powerful film that takes no prisoners and makes no apologies.
","A jaded businessman (Brad Pitt) sets up secret fighting clubs where men can forget the rules of polite society and beat the living daylights out of each other.The political incorrectness arrives like a well-judged upper-cut, but this harsh, often violent film packs all sorts of surprising punches - including a late revelation about its two lead characters. It polarises opinion but remains bold, exciting and unmissable. Studio executives did not like Fight Club, and they restructured director David Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. The Guardian saw the film as an omen for change in American political life, and described its visual style as ground-breaking.",8,1,4,18 July 2010
Akira," Anime has had a devoted following since its beginnings, but it didn't have much crossover appeal in the U.S. until Akira came along.
","Akira is phenomenal animation with all the hallmarks of an instant cult classic. It's about a gang of slum kids in post-apocalyptic Tokyo who band together to counter the scheming of a friend turned bad.Akira is a stunningly executed animated film, adapted from a comic-strip by Katsuhiro Otomo, that generates so much audience adrenalin that the uneven narrative is easy to overlook. At the time, most anime was notorious for cutting production corners with limited motion, such as having only the characters' mouths move while their faces remained static. Akira broke from this trend with detailed scenes, lip-synched dialogue - a first for an anime production - and super-fluid motion as realized in the film's more than 160,000 animation cels. Akira is a landmark anime film that that influenced much of the art in the anime world that followed its release. It also led the way for the growth of popularity of anime outside of Japan.",10,4,9,7 December 2009
Citizen Kane," Widely considered the greatest American movie ever made.
","A newspaper tycoon (Orson Welles) dies, and a magazine reporter interviews his friends in an effort to discover the meaning of his last word: 'Rosebud.'Citizen Kane is a brilliant piece of Hollywood cinema, using all the resources of the studio; despite lapses of characterization and gaps in the narrative, almost every shot and every line is utterly absorbing both as entertainment and as craft. A critical success, the film failed to recoup its costs at the box-office. Raising Kane by Pauline Kael, adapted from the 1971 New Yorker essay about the film, is recommended reading.",10,1,3,11 May 2010
The Birth of a Nation," The most successful and artistically advanced film of its time.
","It's a film about Northern and Southern families who are caught up in the American Civil War.The Birth Of A Nation is cinema's first and most famous epic, many sequences of which retain their mastery, despite Afro-American villains, Ku Klux Klan heroes, and white actors in blackface. Originally shown as The Clansman; a shorter version with orchestral track was released in 1931. A brilliant piece of film-making, though its political attitudes understandably cast long shadows over its reputation. It was the highest-grossing film of the silent film era, and is noted for its innovative camera techniques and narrative achievements.",10,1,7,23 July 2010
Memento," A crafty, twisty thriller that builds itself on the foundation of film noirs past and present.
","In Los Angeles an insurance agent (Guy Pearce) with the inability to form short-term memories attempts to avenge the rape and murder of his wife.Memento was an astonishingly ambitious feature for young British director Christopher Nolan to undertake as his first American production, attempting - at the end of the films' first century - to rewrite the rules of narrative cinema in some way: much of what we see takes place in reverse, as dictated by the hero's condition. That it succeeds in not only being comprehensible - thanks to bold, indelible performances - but a resonant musing on identity makes the film even more astounding. Hugely influential among aspiring screenwriters, this is a film that demands fullest attention.

Captain Marvel," This fierce girl-power flick has many thrills, laughs, and terse combat scenes.
","I don't review films often, but I think that Avengers: Endgame (2019) is worth talking about. First of all, I saw Captain Marvel (2019) for the second time recently, and this time I paid for the ticket. I now think that it's one of the best MCU films, if I'm being honest. I've never been a Marvel fan because I don't like to be a fan of anything, really. In my opinion, being a fan of something is for uninformed people. But Marvel films, for example, are worth seeing at least once because they contain messages from the Anglo-American establishment. The only problem is that you have to be informed in order to notice and understand these messages. Marvel films are also enjoyable to watch. I'm not one of those people who dislike Brie Larson because of something that she said. She plays the role of Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel. I've got better things to do than hating some woman actress. I mean, what do people expect at this point? Sure, I guess that they need an outlet for their anger, and there are many things to be angry about these days, especially for white middle class men, but picking Hollywood as the object of hatred seems silly to me. Hollywood has been feeding them propaganda their whole lives, but now, all of a sudden, they are angry because some actress bluntly stated the agenda. I don't mean to insult them because I understand their situation, but I think that they should pick up a book and read once in a while. They'll feel better and be more informed. This is actually one of the problems with Western people now. Carroll Quigley mentioned this matter in one of his interviews. Western people hardly ever read anymore. Instead of reading, they watch television or see films. Nowadays, there's a new distraction, which is playing video games. Therefore, because of their lack of knowledge and lack of critical thinking, Western people can be so easily manipulated by the authorities. When it comes to me, what I find a little interesting about Brie Larson is that her personality is kind of like mine. This is a rare case. Therefore, I really don't feel like hating her. Anyway, Captain Marvel, the character, doesn't play an important role in Avengers: Endgame, as it turns out. I did find Larson's acting to be pretty good in the film. Carol Danvers is important in her own film, but, in Avengers: Endgame, her importance in the story has been way overblown before the release of the film. Avengers: Endgame is kind of a mess. It's not really a piece of garbage because there are good things in it, but the script is so poorly written that the film ends up being one of the worst MCU films, and perhaps the worst one. Honest reviewers on IMDb have already pointed out the numerous flaws of this film. There's fat, pathetic Thor. There are the inconsistencies with time travel. There's the silly humor. There's the poorly thought out final battle. There are the continuity problems. Yep, this film is a real stinker in some ways. Still, I did find it to be entertaining. It didn't make me feel bored. I think that out of the two most recent Avengers films, Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was much more important for Marvel and the filmmakers than Avengers: Endgame. Therefore, Avengers: Infinity War contains the cool action, the filmmaking craft, and the important messages that the filmmakers wanted people to see. Avengers: Endgame, on the other hand, turns out to be a film with leftovers. Thanos said his piece about overpopulation and limited resources in Avengers: Infinity War. He succeeded in killing half of all life in the universe with the snappening. Naturally, Marvel couldn't let this be the end of the story. People would have been outraged at such a depressing finale. Therefore, Avengers: Endgame had to be made so that the Avengers could defeat Thanos and undo his doings, though Thanos does have a few more things to say this time as well. This time he makes a little speech about rewriting history and brainwashing people. In addition, Iron Man and Captain America had to be killed off because Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans have been playing these roles long enough. In addition, the writers and the filmmakers saw an opportunity to patch up some of the inconsistencies from previous MCU films. Rene Russo came back to better develop the character of Frigga because of a lack of development in Thor: The Dark World (2013). Hawkeye gets more screen time as well because people complained about his lack of screen time in previous films. So, the filmmakers wanted to service the fans, and the fans sure did get serviced with Avengers: Endgame. They got serviced hard. In my opinion, Avengers: Endgame turned out to be a leftovers and patch up film after the main event that was Avengers: Infinity War. And, of course, Avengers: Endgame sets up the next phase of the MCU. Funnily enough, the directors, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, are now responsible not only for some of the best MCU films but also for the worst and most ridiculous MCU film.I finished reading the book 'Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932 - 1945, and the American Cover-Up' by Sheldon H. Harris. I think that it's essential reading for those who are interested in World War II. But it's a good book to read for anyone, really. The history that this book covers has been suppressed in the USA because Japan is a close ally of the USA. It has also been suppressed in other countries. In the book, there's information about what happened to the American POWs that were captured by the Japanese after Japan attacked the Philippines. Japan, as it turns out, had the largest biological weapons program in the world at that time. The author also wrote about post-war Japan and about the domination of conservatives and reactionaries in Japanese government. I haven't yet finished reading Nikolay Danilevsky's 'Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World'. But I have come across more interesting information in the book that is worth mentioning. Danilevsky pointed out that there have been three periods of development and growth in the history of Western civilization. It's almost certain that this is where Carroll Quigley got the idea that there were three separate ages of expansion in Western history. I know that Danilevsky's book was very influential for Quigley because he mentioned it in two of his books. Moreover, Danilevsky even wrote the dates of these periods of development, though Danilevsky didn't go into them in detail and he didn't discern that they happened because of different instruments of expansion. Currently, I'm also reading Immanuel Velikovsky's 'Worlds in Collision' and Oswald Spengler's 'The Decline of the West'. Since I haven't yet finished reading these books, I can't comment on how much I like them or dislike them. I have been enjoying reading both of them so far, and I will tell what I think about them after I'm done reading them.",8,5,12,18 May 2019
Iron Man 2," An exhilarating and funny superhero sequel.
","Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.The film's special effects are excellent. Some of the time, however, they're used on shootouts and explosions that don't produce much excitement. There's a lot more humour this time around. I was smiling or laughing during most of the film. Scarlett Johansson as the beautiful Natasha Romanoff gets to show off some impressive martial arts moves. It's rather funny afterwards because no one else can fight like her. Overall, the film is not as good as Iron Man. Still, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster and the performances are solid. I wasn't expecting much from the film but was pleasantly surprised. I recommend Iron Man 2.",8,36,70,11 June 2010
The Hunger Games," Romance takes a backseat to issues of class, mass media, and a brave heroine.
","The Harry Potter film franchise taught movie studios that a lot of money can be made from popular book-to-film adaptations. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was released in 2011, but now it's the norm that every year there are several attempts at starting a new franchise. Some are successful and some are not successful. Of course these films are aimed mostly at a teenage audience. One of the most popular franchises has been The Hunger Games by Lionsgate Films. The studio managed to pile up $78 million for this first film, which was released in March of 2012. The budget isn't very large but the filmmakers managed to make a good film. At the box office the earnings amounted to an impressive $691 million. One of the reasons for the success was the casting of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. Chloe Moretz was supposed to get the part but she failed her auditions. Director Gary Ross said that he was most impressed with Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence isn't the perfect fit for Katniss physically. Katniss is supposed to be shorter, thinner and have olive skin. Still, Lawrence has the good looks and the acting skills to make up for that. Her facial expressions capture Katniss' feelings without going over the top. She's especially good when it comes to the most important scenes. One example is when she grieves for Rue. Amandla Stenberg had to be persistent to get the part of Rue. Good thing she did because her scenes with Lawrence are some of the best in the film. Rue and Katniss talking in a sunlit forest was handled especially well by Gary Ross. The only real downside to Ross' direction is a lack of thrilling action. Was this due to the budget constraints? Or was this due to the attempt to maintain a PG-13 rating? Suzanne Collins' novel includes some sinister and violent parts that weren't in the film. In the excellent supporting cast Stanley Tucci's turn as Caesar Flickerman is especially memorable. Tucci is simply terrific. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson do a good job as Effie and Haymitch. Banks is most memorable during the Reaping scene. Josh Hutcherson, however, is rather bland as Peeta Mellark. Once Katniss and Peeta get on the train headed for the Capitol, Hutcherson mostly fails to provide his character with the necessary emotions. He does a better job in the second film though. James Newton Howard's music score for the film is admirably restrained. He doesn't fill it with intensity but provides a bittersweet elegiac experience. The end credits feature the sad lullaby Safe & Sound by Taylor Swift, who sings it with a reassuring warmth. Suzanne Collins was, of course, inspired by Greek and Roman history. The Capitol is like a futuristic Rome. The Hunger Games arena is like a futuristic colosseum. Slavery was a major institution in Greece and Rome, so it's not surprising that gladiators fought to the death in Classical society as entertainment and spectacle. In the Hunger Games tributes from each district fight to the death, and Katniss is a defiant teenage gladiator who challenges the power of the authoritarian Capitol. Despite the shortage of thrills the film provides viewers with a well-realized world, with its unique clothes, architecture and rules. It's a good beginning for a franchise. I recommend it.",8,1,6,15 January 2014
12 Monkeys," One of the leading cult favorites of the 1990s.
","12 Monkeys is a complex and rewarding fantasy. In the middle of the 21st century, when most of the earth's population has been wiped out by a deadly virus and the few remaining people alive exist underground, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent to travel back in time to find a cure.Director Terry Gilliam's hit-and-miss genius is in full flower here, a perfect match for this fascinating story. Willis gives one of his best dramatic performances, while Brad Pitt certainly extended his range with his comic, if self-consciously showy turn as a nervously twitchy asylum inmate. It's a terrific thrill ride, with visual touches and sharp narrative turns that are utterly inspired.",8,0,2,18 July 2010
Mississippi Burning," Mississippi Burning is an all-names-changed dramatization of the Ku Klux Klan's murders of three civil rights workers in 1964.
","In 1964, three civil rights activists go missing in Mississippi, and two FBI agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) with directly opposing methods pursue their murderers.Mississippi Burning is a film much garlanded with awards, yet the charge about its uneasy focus on the fate of white activists is one that sticks. However, it is shot exquisitely, moves along with relentless power, and at least conveys an unequivocal message about racism, however unexceptional and self-congratulatory that may be. Hackman's turn as the pragmatic FBI man, prepared to spout racial hatred in order to catch his perpetrators, is mesmerising. Mississippi Burning was preceded in 1975 by a television docudrama titled Attack On Terror: The FBI vs. The Ku Klux Klan, depicting many of the same events.",7,2,2,9 February 2010
Au Revoir les Enfants," Accepts the weighty challenge of making a Holocaust movie and acquits itself proudly.
","The film is sombre, lovingly detailed... its emotional power remains undeniable. A Catholic boy (Gaspard Manesse) in occupied France betrays his friend's (Raphael Fejto) Jewish identity by mistake.Goodbye, Children is a carefully controlled and intensely moving semi-autobiographical drama, a late masterpiece from the remarkable director Louis Malle. It achieves an amazing particularity in its portrait of childhood, yet the themes of loyalty, friendship and belonging are universal. The film won the Golden Lion award at the 1987 Venice Film Festival. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay at the 60th Academy Awards.",8,1,2,1 July 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," In a time of massive summer blockbusters, this high-sailing ship is definitely a crowd-pleaser.
","An eccentric pirate (Johnny Depp) rushes to the rescue when the British governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) is kidnapped by his former shipmates. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Depp.Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is an enjoyable action adventure, based on a Disney theme-park ride, that barely has a coherent plot but still hits the spot - especially as Depp's Jack Sparrow, in this first film of the franchise, has the advantage of surprise. His mascara-lidded, swaggering, cockney pirate, a rock star by any other name, is a truly original creation.",8,0,6,9 September 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Darkness is polished pop cinema that's also one of this summer's best releases.
","Star Trek Into Darkness is an exciting science fiction action film, with more emphasis on action than on science fiction. It's a sequel that's on par with Star Trek (2009). Trekkers may again be disappointed with director J. J. Abrams' work because he replaced much of the intelligence of the old Star Trek with humor, spectacle and, dare I say it, violence. But what else can one expect from summer blockbusters these days? It's a sign of the times, and if you want to know why it is so I recommend reading books by American historian Carroll Quigley. The well-chosen cast remain intact and provide more of that humor and interplay that people liked so much in the previous film. They do a good job. With the direction of Abrams they all deliver good performances. Chris Pine was likable before but he only got better here. I think that Zachary Quinto doesn't play Spock as well as Pine plays James T. Kirk. Quinto is fine in the role, but if you compare his performance to that of Leonard Nimoy it's clear that he's lacking. Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov was one of the standouts in the previous film. It was always interesting to see him on screen. Here he's as good as ever but he was given less screen time than before. And it's not just Chekov. It seems that all the secondary characters have less dialogue this time around. More time is spent on the action. Compared to the old Star Trek films this is a difference. But the character relationships are still there. Much of the humor is provided by Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy and Simon Pegg as Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott. The 2009 film lacked the presence of a strong villain. This time writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof make up for that with an antagonist who's a real challenge for the entire Enterprise crew. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves the praise that he has received. He's determined. He's cunning. He's ruthless. He's sympathetic when he needs to be. The alternate time line that was established allows for some neat changes to the events in the old Star Trek films. The biggest draw, however, is the eye-popping action and the exciting, slick set pieces. These are aided by Dan Mindel's appealing cinematography and Michael Giacchino's bombastic, rousing score. In conclusion, Into Darkness is a bright futuristic adventure. Considering it's high entertainment value it's no surprise that it has become a commercial success. I recommend it.",8,3,6,20 July 2013
12 Angry Men," The film boasts a series of excellent performances by young actors who would soon become household names.
","12 Angry Men is today viewed as a classic, highly regarded from both a critical and popular viewpoint. A murder case jury about to vote guilty is convinced otherwise by one doubting member (Henry Fonda).Though unconvincing in detail, this is a brilliantly tight character melodrama which is never less than absorbing to experience. Acting and direction are superlatively tight, and the film was important in helping to establish television talents in Hollywood. In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'.",9,1,2,8 July 2010
Oldboy," South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook directed this violent and offbeat story of punishment and vengeance.
","A Korean man (Choi Min-sik) goes after revenge after being kidnapped and unjustly imprisoned for 15 years. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance (2002) and followed by Sympathy For Lady Vengeance (2005).This brutally violent thriller combines bizarre comedy with chilling savagery in a highly individual way. Constantly fascinating, though it's hard to watch a tongue being snipped out with scissors, and other acts of mutilation. Oldboy is a sadistic masterpiece. The film won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and high praise from the President of the Jury, director Quentin Tarantino.",8,2,5,26 June 2010
Spider-Man 2," Stan Lee's all-too-human superhero returns to the screen in this highly anticipated sequel to 2002's blockbuster hit Spider-Man.
","Spider-Man 2 is an excellent fusion of action, drama and romance. This is a superhero film with heart. Most importantly, this is a superhero film that can be taken seriously. Set two years after the original, the film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man. The main villain in this film is Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who turns insane following a failed experiment and the death of his wife. Using his mechanical tentacles, Octavius is dubbed 'Doctor Octopus' and threatens to endanger the lives of the people of New York City.The film is an improvement over Spider-Man (2002). The first film was good, but the second is excellent. I will even say that it's the best superhero film ever (and yes, I have seen The Dark Knight). Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is going through a tough time. It's clearly shown that being a committed superhero means that he has a lot less time to spend on his other activities. He's a genius, but he isn't doing well at school. He's in love with Mary Jane but he often doesn't have time to see her. 'With great power comes great responsibility' his uncle told him. Maguire, this time around, is completely believable as Peter Parker. He's a fully realized protagonist. Many people go through the same problems as him from day to day and that's why people can relate to him. In addition to that Parker shows that he can make an effort and change, thus showing that change is possible no matter who you are. Dr. Octavius also shows that he's capable of change (even though he's the villain). The fights between him and Spidey are amazing. A lot of thought went into every action sequence. The special effects are seamless. There's a good amount of humor, and the dialogue is fitting (in some parts even outstanding). The actors are good in their roles, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May is especially effective in one scene. In addition to all this, Spider-Man 2 is expertly directed by Sam Raimi, so not a single scene feels out of place. There's hardly anything wrong with the entire picture. The only downside is that the film is a fantasy (almost all superhero films are). Spider-Man 2 is a film that can capture the imagination, and unlike some superhero films (The Dark Knight, for example) it's faithful to the comic book. The film features the right photography of New York City, Spidey's web slinging, and peoples' fascination with power and science. The film shows that doing the right thing can be difficult, but that shouldn't stop anyone from doing so.",9,0,1,27 September 2009
Brokeback Mountain," An effective psychological study of a man so afraid of revealing emotions that he nearly implodes due to his inability to express himself.
","The film is that rare thing, a big Hollywood weeper with a beautiful ache at its centre. It's a modern-day Western that turns into a quietly revolutionary love story. Wyoming, 1963: two young male ranchhards (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) enter into a relationship while tending sheep on a mountain, and find it hard to adjust to married reality once they come down off the hillside.Brokeback Mountain is a major achievement, but a supremely delicate piece of film-making, sensitive to a particular moment, place, set of attitudes, even to those viewers who might be left queasy by the thought of two cowboys sharing more than just a tent. Director Ang Lee gets performances of staggering maturity from his young cast, and the prevailing mood is exceptionally vivid: time passes by under vast blue skies, sweeping the characters further and further away from a brief instant of happiness.",9,8,9,3 July 2010
The Hustler," The Hustler combines elements of film noir, Westerns, sports films, and a heavy dose of existentialism.
","The Hustler is the supreme classic of that great American genre, the low-life film. It tells the story of small-time pool hustler 'Fast Eddie' Felson (Paul Newman) and his desire to prove himself the best player in the country by beating legendary pool player 'Minnesota Fats' (Jackie Gleason).The film is a downbeat melodrama that beautifully captures the seedy atmosphere of smoky, dingy pool halls and frames Fast Eddie's mission as a mythic struggle and a rite of passage into full manhood. The dialogue now seems florid and over-rated, but this was a defining role for Newman, who carries the film. The film's exploration of winning, losing, and character garnered a number of major awards; it is also credited with helping to spark a resurgence in the popularity of pool.",10,1,3,22 December 2009
Terminator Salvation," Terminator Salvation is a visual treat with thrilling action.
","Too bad I didn't see this film in a theater when it was released back in 2009. For me this is the most enjoyable Terminator film since James Cameron's last effort in 1991. The reason for this is the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation. In addition, the filmmakers dared to try new things, resulting in an interesting, entertaining and gritty film. Schwarzenegger, a great presence in the first two Terminator films, should have left the role of the T-800 when he became old. This is my opinion. This would have resulted in better sequels or reboots after James Cameron stopped making Terminator films. Schwarzenegger's presence requires screenwriters to construct a plot revolving around his T-800, and this has resulted in two repetitive and average cash-grabs titled Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003) and Terminator Genisys (2015). This problem is especially clear in Genisys, for which, instead of trying something new, the screenwriters (Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier) delivered a poorly-written and confusing screenplay because Schwarzenegger, who's 68 years old now, agreed to return. As a result, we got an 'old but not obsolete' good Terminator, yet another attempt to prevent Judgment Day, an evil John Connor (something that I really didn't like), and an overstuffed plot with unimaginative details and possible plot holes. Well, Genisys was just another uninspired attempt to make money, however, I still enjoyed the film despite its faults, and I recommend seeing it. Schwarzenegger is no longer the box office draw that he used to be in the 1980s and 1990s, but Emilia Clarke is definitely a good screen presence. And so, Terminator Salvation doesn't have this 'Arnold problem.' It introduces new characters, and further develops established characters like John Connor. On second thought, Connor has little or no character development in this film, but it's still good to see him. We also get to see the future in 2018, after Judgment Day. For the most part, the designers and special-effects technicians did an excellent job creating the robots, vehicles and buildings. Though there are some missteps when we get to see Skynet headquarters. The action scenes that one expects from a film like this are mostly exciting and even original. The images are memorable as well, be it a nuclear explosion, a ruined city, a big deadly Terminator, or an apocalyptic wasteland. Because of all this, Terminator Salvation really deserves to be called a science fiction action film. On the downside, the screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris is unfocused and rather simple. One can say that there are two main characters, but neither one gets enough development. The exploration of human nature that was present in James Cameron's films is absent. But at least the dialogue is fine, for the most part. Director McG can be applauded because he knew what he wanted this film to be like, and he followed through with his vision, resulting in a film that's epic, enjoyable and a bit disturbing. So, I definitely recommend Terminator Salvation. It has its faults, but it does not, as Arnold said, s*ck. It rules.",5,2,3,9 August 2015
Juno," Juno is the best film of its kind to come out in years.
","An unconventional 16 year old girl (Ellen Page) faces an unplanned pregnancy, the result of a one night stand with her best friend (Michael Cera). After considering abortion, but unable to go through with it, she decides to give the baby up for adoption, and plans auditioning suitable parents.Juno is a witty, charming, and even wise little comedy with two young star turns from Page and Cera, and a shrewdly deployed supporting cast. Diablo Cody won an Oscar for her screenplay, which is brittle and amusing, but initially seems intent on cramming in as many one-line gags as possible. The mood (and the script) thankfully relaxes as the story continues. It's delightful, but it veers close to self-regarding whimsy, exemplified by Kimya Dawson's grating songs. The film has gone on to earn more than 35 times that amount for a total of $231 million, becoming the highest grossing film in distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures's history.",9,1,2,2 July 2010
L.A. Confidential," L.A. Confidential proved that it was still possible to fashion an actor-driven detective yarn in 1990s Hollywood.
","L.A. Confidential is a tough, gorgeous, vastly entertaining throwback to the Hollywood that did things rights. The story is about a group of Los Angeles police in the 1950s, and police corruption bumping up against Hollywood celebrity.The film has a gloriously labyrinthine narrative, wrapped around half a dozen morally compromised figures worthy of films in their own right: tautly directed, lavishly produced and superlatively performed by everyone from its up-and-coming young stars to the smallest big player, this was one of the finest – not to mention toughest – American pictures of the 1990s. L.A. Confidential was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two, Kim Basinger for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland for Best Screenplay - Adapted.",9,1,3,22 December 2009
Spider-Man 3," Crackling with breakneck energy and rousing humor, this entry strives to up the entertainment ante.
","Spider-Man 3 stands as the most successful film in the series worldwide and Marvel's most successful film. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is comfortable, even self-satisfied, about Spider-Man's fame and success, but then his character comes under scrutiny when an alien organism morphs itself into a black suit that envelops him.It is a decent addition to the franchise, with some nice moments: self-effacing Parker developing a swagger as he enjoys new-found celebrity, and a terrific new villain, the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who can turn at will into a fearsome monster made out of grains of sand. A couple of other villains might have been excised from the script, but the special effects are often dazzling, and while overlong, the film could be said to represent super-sized value.",7,6,8,21 May 2010
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Rwanda tackles one of the most horrifically ugly events in recent history.
","It is a powerful portrait of a slightly befuddled man who, when inhuman demands were placed on him, found within himself an unexpected response. The owner (Don Cheadle) of a hotel in Kigali opens it as a refuge for imperilled Tsutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Hotel Rwanda is a powerful slant on a crisis that shook the world, but not to the extent of stepping in: it works mainly as a conventional salute to one man's bravery, but Cheadle handles the demands of his role superbly. The film was nominated and won several awards in 2004–2005, including those from the Berlin and Toronto International Film Festivals.",8,0,0,3 July 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Like Bonnie and Clyde in 1967, glamorous outlaws Butch and Sundance were in tune with the late-'60s counterculture.
","Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid does wonderful things with mood and atmosphere. It tells the story of bank robbers Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman) and his partner The Sundance Kid (played by Robert Redford), based loosely on historical fact.The film is a humorous, cheerful, poetic and cinematic account of two semi-legendary outlaws, winningly acted and directed. Newman and Redford made a superb, handsome, dry-humoured double act, and every Hollywood studio wanted to reunite them after this outing. (It finally happened in 1973 in The Sting). One of the decade's great commercial successes, not least because of the song 'Raindrops Keeps Fallin' On My Head'. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid has been part of the United States National Film Registry since 2003.",10,0,2,18 December 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Widely regarded as the screen's greatest satire, a film that superbly encapsulates the fear and paranoia of the Cold War.
","A mad US air force general (Sterling Hayden) launches a nuclear attack on Russia, and when recall attempts fail, and retaliation is inevitable, all concerned sit back to await the destruction of the world.Dr. Strangelove is a black comedy resolving itself into a series of sketches, with the versatile Peter Sellers playing three parts: the US president, an RAF captain, and a demented German-American scientist. Historically important in its timing, its nightmares being those of the early 1960s, it once more has genuine and chilling resonance in the early 21st century. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film 'culturally significant' and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.",10,1,2,1 July 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," A film such as Pan's Labyrinth couldn't exist without the apocalyptically titled War on Terror.
","Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliant work of the imagination, capable of truly seizing and igniting our fantasies. In 1944 Spain, the imaginative stepdaughter (Ivana Baquero) of a cruel fascist army captain (Sergi Lopez i Ayats) takes refuge in a fantasy world, and meets a faun, a monstrous toad and a pale, death-like man.The film is a supernatural drama set against the real-life aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, when victorious fascists were hunting down resistance fighters. The fantasy elements, superbly realised through brilliant CGI work and set design, illuminate the stark horrors, explicitly portrayed, that occur in Ofelia's real world. Outstanding performances by Lopez and Baquero, and Maribel Verdu as the gallant, courageous housekeeper Mercedes. But the major credit is director Guillermo del Toro's; from disparate elements he has forged a monumental work of visually breathtaking art.",10,3,10,10 May 2010
Alien," 'In space, no one can hear you scream.'
","Astronauts returning to Earth visit an apparently dead planet and are infected by a violent being with unpredictable behaviour patterns, which starts to eliminate them one by one.Alien is one of director Ridley Scott's career highlights: a terrific-looking, genuinely scary story in a claustrophobic space. It's both a horror flick and a science-fiction B-movie, set in space. The moment when the legendary H.R. Giger's creature first makes its appearance is a classic film moment. Alien has remained highly praised in subsequent decades, being inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2002 for historical preservation as a film which is 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'.",10,0,2,22 May 2010
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad delivers a solid two hours of aesthetically pleasing, superpowered action that's just plain fun to watch.
","There are currently two serious, mind-boggling questions that need to be answered. First, why did John Flickster watch Fifty Shades Of Black (2016)? Second, why isn't Justin Bieber on display in some zoo? By the way, I like watching some of John Flickster's movie reviews. He has a good channel. Anyway, I watched Suicide Squad (2016) some time ago, and I was somewhat surprised by it. Warner Bros. Pictures is in the process of creating its own so-called cinematic universe with DC Comics superheroes. This decision was influenced by the money-making success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So, like any other large entertainment company without an original idea, Warner Bros. Pictures wants to get in on the action. Some people might say that the company is not off to a good start. They're right. But I still like some things in the movies that Warner Bros. Pictures has released so far. These movies are Man Of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016). On the one hand, these movies are dumb, unoriginal, violent and depressing pieces of Hollywood garbage. On the other hand, there are some good ideas in these movies. Also, the acting is good in places, the special effects are good, and, for example, the people that worked on hair and make-up for Suicide Squad deserved winning an Oscar. But this is what one would expect from Warner Bros, which is a major Hollywood studio. I mean, you can't expect a movie with a budget of almost $200 million to be garbage on all levels. Still, because of the problems that I've mentioned, I'm not going to go around and say that I like Suicide Squad or Man Of Steel. Seriously, how can you like a movie in which ships look like johnsons? That's really too bad because I like some other things in Man Of Steel, like the special effects and the designs. Unfortunately, I will never say that I like Man Of Steel because it's depressing, because the characters are not interesting, and because Zack Snyder seems to have an obsession with phallus symbolism in all of his movies. Does anyone remember 300, which was released in 2006? Thanks to that movie, we've learned that soldiers in Ancient Greece spent a lot of time working out in American gyms. Maybe the Persians should have bought passes to American gyms too. Suicide Squad is an entertaining movie. I probably enjoyed watching it more than I enjoyed watching Man Of Steel. Still, like Man Of Steel, Suicide Squad is weighed down by some of the same problems, and it is, first of all, a Hollywood product. I feel the same way about Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith. I remember watching this movie in a theatre. It's when I was still going to high school. I watched it in the same theatre in which I watched Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence. It was summer. The auditorium was full of people. There were many children. I remember being entertained by Revenge Of The Sith. It was quite a spectacle on the big screen. It's one of my most memorable theatre going experiences. But now, of course, I know that it's not such a good movie. It has some problems, to say the least. Watching it in a theatre, however, was quite something. There have been so many movies about superheroes in the last decade that there have been talks about superhero movie fatigue, as if people are tired of watching movies about superheroes. Well, I certainly don't have this fatigue. Other people don't have this fatigue too because these movies are still very profitable. If they're done well, they will certainly make a lot of money. Though I have the feeling that Hollywood keeps making these movies not just for profits. It seems to me that these movies have a certain social message, especially movies about teams of superheroes. I think that the concept of superheroes and supervillains in Western society goes back to feudalism and to knights. So much Western literature is about super heroes and super villains. So, Sherlock Holmes just had to be a super detective and Professor Moriarty just had to be a super criminal. This concept of individualism is present in the art and literature of few other cultures.",6,1,1,18 March 2017
Battleship Potemkin," The Battleship Potemkin is must-see cinema.
","The Battleship Potemkin was said to have been a favourite of Charlie Chaplin. It presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime.The film is a textbook cinema classic, and a masterpiece of creative editing, especially in the famous Odessa Steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed; the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross-cutting. The film contains 1,300 separate shots, and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics. The Battleship Potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world.",10,4,7,7 December 2009
Taxi Driver," 'All the animals come out at night.'
","A lonely Vietnam veteran (Robert De Niro) becomes a New York taxi driver and allows the violence and squalor around him to explode in his mind. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.Taxi Driver is the epitome of the sordid realism of the 1970s, this unlovely but brilliantly made film haunts the mind and paints a most vivid picture of a hell on earth. Bernard Herrmann's haunting, almost slurred music captures the desolate mood to perfection. The film gained notoriety when John Hinckley, Jr. confessed that it was his obsession with Foster's role that made him attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1981.",10,0,1,1 July 2010
Capote," Capote is spellbinding and awe-striking, a perfect film.
","How often does one see a masterpiece about a masterpiece? In the film the writer Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) investigates the Kansas murders that would come to form the basis of In Cold Blood.Capote is a rare biopic that seeks not to sanctify its protagonist, or excuse his many failings, instead turning close attention to the collateral damage than can flow from the creative process: powered by Hoffman's exceptional performance, it has much the same cold, hard crunch of verisimilitude as would have struck readers of Capote's book upon first publication. The film was filmed mostly in Manitoba, and was released on September 30, 2005, to coincide with what would have been Truman Capote's 81st birthday.",8,0,0,21 May 2010
Lost in Translation," A story of love and friendship blooming under unlikely circumstances.
","The film creeps up on you and finds its way into your heart so that you just don't want to say goodbye. A washed-up American actor (Bill Murray) in Tokyo to shoot a whisky commercial meets a bored young woman (Scarlett Johansson), all but ignored by her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi).Lost In Translation is a thin slip of a film, perhaps, and one that tends to view Japan as unbridgeably foreign, an approach which led to charges of racism. But its moods and textures cast a beguiling spell, and director Sofia Coppola proves especially sensitive to actors: the film positioned Johansson as the face of her generation, and more significantly gave Murray several of his finest moments in years.",9,1,2,2 July 2010
Interstellar," Interstellar is driven by scientific concepts that fascinate and thrill in equal measure.
","Interstellar is a film about space travel and the heroism of reaching for something greater. The optimistic and forward-looking themes of this film are something that we haven't seen in American science-fiction movies for a long time. Because of this, Interstellar is definitely closest to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and The Right Stuff (1983). And like those two masterworks of film-making it's mostly about human nature and going into the unknown. Director Christopher Nolan and his screenwriter brother Jonathan have always tried to bring intelligence to their screenplays. One can find faults with the execution of the ideas in this film but it remains thought-provoking regardless. There isn't much action in Interstellar. Most of the time is spent on showing a nearly inhospitable future world and the mission to explore new worlds. Still, since this is a Nolan film, the action that's included is thrilling and no less awe-inspiring than in his previous films. In fact, the action alone is worth the price of admission. It's that good. I can fault Nolan for spending too much time on Earth because in Interstellar this setting just isn't that interesting. The messages of Environmentalism are also easy to notice. Sure, the time is spent on getting to know Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) family and why he decides to leave. But because this is a science-fiction movie it would have been better to spend more time on what happens in space. Interstellar is a slice of escapism with surprisingly good performances from the actors. Fascinating and thrilling scenes in the film are especially aided by Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy, Wes Bentley and Matt Damon. McConaughey effectively brings Cooper's internal conflict to the surface. He turns the widowed astronaut into a likable protagonist. I'll end my review by mentioning that Interstellar feels like an epic film. When it's over there's a feeling that a lot has happened. This visually dazzling experience takes unexpected turns. I can easily say that it's Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight (2008). Some people may disagree with me on this. I like Inception (2010) too, and I like The Dark Knight Rises (2012) in particular. Interstellar, however, is Nolan's most ambitious film. It's good enough to stand among the most ambitious science-fiction films ever produced. I recommend it.",8,0,3,12 November 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Arguably the director John Ford's greatest film, and the rare Hollywood film superior to its literary source.
","The Grapes Of Wrath is a genuinely great motion picture which makes one proud to have even a small share in the affairs of cinema. After the dust-bowl disaster of the thirties, Oklahoma farmers trek to California in the hope of a better life.It's a superb film which could scarcely be improved upon. Though the ending is softened from the book, there was too much here for filmgoers to chew on. Acting, photography, direction combine to make this an unforgettable experience, a poem of a film. In 1989, the film was one of the first 25 films to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.'",10,3,6,13 June 2010
Pacific Rim," A big, beautiful and sophisticated science fiction treat.
","Guillermo del Toro gets it right with Pacific Rim, an action-packed science fiction film that seems familiar but, at the same time, original. This is a story about gigantic humanoid mecha (Jaegers) fighting colossal monsters (Kaiju). If you watch anime you may know that the plot is similar to a number of anime. The film, however, is a tribute to older anime and not a rip-off. Yes, it successfully captures the appeal, weirdness and style of giant robot anime in live-action form. In short, this is a film that many Japanese filmmakers wish they could make. And with the addition of excellent visual effects and a suitable cast Pacific Rim reaches heights that many anime viewers and nerds always wanted to see. Some reviewers compared Pacific Rim to Godzilla films but once you watch it it's clear that giant robot anime was the real inspiration, one of the most important being Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) by director Hideaki Anno. The Kaiju are somewhat similar to the angels in Evangelion in their fighting abilities, size and the frequency of their appearance. Rinko Kikuchi's character Mako Mori is very much like Rei Ayanami; her behavior, her relationship with Raleigh Becket, her backstory, and of course her hair with blue highlights. The Jaegers too resemble the Evas. Then there's the action, which is tense and exciting and backed up with a good soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi. But there's no action overkill because del Toro also spent enough time on developing the characters. Charlie Hunnam does a fine job as the protagonist. Idris Elba and Charlie Day shine in their roles. When talking about Elba's character Stacker Pentecost del Toro said 'he's doing penance for all humanity... Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes.' And, unlike many recent action blockbusters, Pacific Rim doesn't involve the American military. Del Toro is a self-described pacifist so he avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. In conclusion, Pacific Rim is the best blockbuster of this summer. I doubt that any other upcoming film will be better. It's a real success. Thankfully Guillermo del Toro was chosen to direct this $190 million project. It's some proof that once in a while Hollywood studios do spend money wisely. I easily recommend it.",9,4,11,16 July 2013
Glory," Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War.
","The film is richly plotted, alternately inspiring and horrifying, it's an enlightening and entertaining tribute to heroes too long forgotten. During the American Civil War, a young white officer (Matthew Broderick) finds himself in charge of the first black regiment to fight in combat.Glory is an intriguing tribute to heroes unsung for too long. Broderick does most of the heavy lifting as a well-meaning young man (from an anti-slavery family) who is resented by his troops and left to rot by his superiors. But Denzel Washington, as an escaped slave with a bad attitude, steals all his scenes. Veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis invests proceedings with a shimmering beauty.",8,0,1,30 June 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," We scare because we care.
","The film may not be perfect, but it's jam-packed with goodies - like a breakfast cereal fun-pack with a prize on every box-top. Two monsters' (John Goodman and Billy Crystal) attempt to break the all-time record for scaring children after dark is halted when a little girl accidentally ends up in their world.Monsters, Inc. is middle-ranking Pixar, enjoyable and achieving technological firsts with its detailed generation of the monsters' furry exteriors, but prone to easy sentiment; up until an inspired finale, the corporate corridors where much of the action takes place also seem too familiar and unimaginative an environment to sustain any visual wonder.",8,0,1,26 March 2012
American Hustle," Some of this actually happened. So what?
","Only a year after the successful Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell delivered another comedy-drama. American Hustle is overall a good film but it's a step down for Russell because it's not as original or entertaining as Silver Linings Playbook or The Fighter. Russell's and Eric Warren Singer's screenplay has two interesting characters. They're Rosalyn Rosenfeld and Carmine Polito. Jeremy Renner, playing Carmine, is likable as usual in his role. He brightens the proceedings every time he's on screen, and it's not only because of his hair and suit. Renner is definitely one of the best and most charismatic actors in Hollywood. Jennifer Lawrence, playing Rosalyn, is really the star of the film. Like Amy Adams she wears a number of revealing dresses but, unlike Adams, she's young and she looks like a hottie in them. As to be expected her acting is excellent, but she's also the focus of the film's humor. The other three leads in the film are less interesting characters. However, they've been given the most screen time. I consider Christian Bale to be a good actor. He's just not an outstanding actor. Sure, he takes his work very seriously and he has been very effective in some of his roles. But in American Hustle he doesn't bring much charm to Irving Rosenfeld. Russell's screenplay doesn't help because Irving is neither likable or interesting. The screenplay also suffers from a lack of originality. It recalls Fargo (1996) and Goodfellas (1990). There are clever or funny lines here and there but overall it's not that interesting or well-meaning. Its real strength is in its outlandish characters. Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper have the same problems as Bale. Adams does a good job portraying Sydney's emotions though, and Cooper infuses Richard with his usual energy. I'm not a fan of Russell's direction or Linus Sandgren's cinematography. American Hustle is an intelligent film but it's just not that compelling. The story and the characterization needed to be better. I think that Jennifer Lawrence should have had a bigger part, just like in Silver Linings Playbook. I recommend American Hustle. My recommendation isn't enthusiastic though.",8,0,2,2 February 2014
The Godfather: Part II," A legendary continuation and sequel to the landmark 1972 film.
","I think the film is simply one of the great American films. In 1958, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) reflects on the problems of being a Mafia don, and those of his father (Robert De Niro) before him.The Godfather Part II is one of those rare sequels that genuinely eclipses the original film - quite an achievement, in this instance. But Part II fleshes out the history of the Corleone clan, showing the rise of young Don Vito and reflecting on the increasingly icy demeanour of his son Michael as he accommodates himself to becoming a ruthless don. The scenes in Sicily, beautifully shot, have a lyrical, almost Edenic quality, tinged with foreboding: we all know this idyll can not last. De Niro is spellbinding as young Vito, while Pacino almost visibly transforms himself into the man Michael Corleone is becoming. It's an astonishing popular masterpiece.",10,0,3,30 June 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," Director Paul Greengrass brings author Robert Ludlum's popular character back to the big screen.
","The Bourne films is the only action-thriller franchise of the past decade that actually thrills. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), still suffering from memory loss, is determined to uncover his past and discover how he became an assassin, while a US agent tries to track him down.The Bourne Ultimatum is the best of the trilogy, with a logical, grounded narrative and a relentless pace enhanced by quick cutting and razor-sharp editing. Two sequences, one at London's Waterloo station, the other a car chase over rooftops in Tangier, represent visceral film-making at its most accomplished.",8,0,1,1 July 2010
Fargo," Fargo is both an absurdist comedy and a stylized crime drama.
","Fargo is a strikingly mature, unique entertainment that plays on many levels... all satisfying. A cash-strapped Minnesota car salesman (William H. Macy) pays two bungling crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife in order to demand a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. But his scheme goes disastrously wrong.The film is an off-centre masterpiece with Frances McDormand in luminous form as a decent, heavily pregnant police chief whose slow, discursive style of speech disguises the sharpness of her brain. This may be the Coens' most satisfying film: a mixture of droll humour, gory murder, quick wit and bumbling stupidity. The snowy wastes make a striking visual counterpoint for the madcap action and jolting violence.",10,1,2,21 May 2010
Predator," An entertaining marriage of action and science-fiction.
","The film is so lean, so exciting and so imaginative that you can watch it every month or two, year in year out, and never get tired of it. A team of US commandos, sent to eliminate gun-running in South America, find they are being targeted by a deadly alien.Predator is an action thriller that more ore less dispenses with human interaction completely, and concentrates on chases, combat and special effects. Still, director John McTiernan keeps the tension ratcheted up efficiently. The soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri, who was coming off the huge success of Back To the Future in 1985. In 2008, Empire magazine ranked the film 336th on their list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.",8,3,3,9 September 2010
The Bourne Identity," A tight, gripping spy thriller that's a pleasant surprise.
","Left for dead, an American intelligence agent (Matt Damon) wakes with no memory, and attempts to piece together who he really is.The Bourne Identity is a solid, proficient action-thriller that rarely seems to strain for effect: the second hour - which has the hero chasing a paper trail across Europe, while the CIA tries to tie up its loose ends - isn't nearly as much fun as the first, but there's an unexpectedly classy cast for this kind of thing. Particular acclaim was directed toward the film's central car chase which was described as an exciting action highlight and one of the best realized in the genre. The film is the first in a trilogy, being followed by The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).",6,0,2,2 September 2010
Man of Steel," A promising start to a new franchise with a good dose of outlandish comic-book action.
","Warner Bros. Pictures had to begin production on a Superman film by 2011 in order to avoid being sued by the Shuster and Siegel estates for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Even though Man Of Steel is a Hollywood product I still enjoyed watching it very much. What made the difference was Christopher Nolan's involvement as producer and David S. Goyer's script. Read historian Carroll Quigley's books if you want to know what was one of the influences. It's a solid script that tells the difficulties experienced by Clark Kent when he was growing up on Earth well. But we also get a detailed picture of Krypton's downfall, a new story behind the Superman suit, and then a great conflict when General Zod comes to Earth. The story is complex for a superhero film. Even in adulthood Clark isn't entirely sure if he can trust the people of Earth. His adoptive parents are a big help for him. These scenes of growing up and learning to coexist are some of the most effective. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are likable and earnest. Costner, playing Jonathan Kent, in particular effectively embodies goodness and wisdom. The whole cast is solid though. Henry Cavill was a good choice to play Superman. He wears the cape well. He's also sympathetic, especially when he deals with being an alien. My favorite scenes would have to be Clark learning from his biological father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and confronting Zod (Michael Shannon). Jor is a voice of reason that's an opposite to Zod's violence and cruelty. Crowe perfectly embodies virtuosity and hope. Shannon's Zod is a terrific villain with a purpose. Shannon's expressions are the best in the film, making his intentions compelling. Zack Snyder is a competent director but he often fails to draw viewers into his scenes. This problem is present in Man Of Steel. And yet the film is often exhilarating and touching too. Watching Superman fly for the first time is a joy here. Though some people criticized Snyder's 'overlong' action scenes I think that this is exactly what was needed. Previous Superman films mostly lacked the godlike fighting that one expects, but here you get plenty of it. The addition of Hans Zimmer's new music themes gives the action a boost. It's almost like Snyder is atoning for Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006). My opinion is that Man Of Steel is a neat reinvention instead of an obligatory rehash. It certainly entertains and I recommend it.",7,2,6,28 July 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," A tightly constructed and stellar comedy.
","A dysfunctional American family includes a failed motivational speaker (Greg Kinnear), facing financial ruin; an oversexed, drug-taking grandfather (Alan Arkin); a sulky mute teenager (Paul Dano) who communicates only by notepad; and a suicidal uncle (Steve Carell). With the family's relatively sane mother (Toni Collette), they travel in their dilapidated Volkswagen bus to a California beauty pageant in which their nine-year-old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a contestant. Then 10-year-old Breslin was nominated for several Best Supporting Actress and Breakthrough Performance awards.Little Miss Sunshine is an achingly funny comedy, shrewdly cast. Its script overflows with witty lines and snappy dialogue, but also speaks volumes about the American obsession with winning. The Hoover family, at first glance, are losers, but their ability to stick together through trying times makes them anything but. It's a joyous film that succeeds on its own terms, and even dispenses friendly wisdom.",8,6,9,30 June 2010
North by Northwest," Equal parts sly identity crisis, suspenseful cross-continental chase, and cool romance, North By Northwest is one of Hitchcock's most enjoyable films.
","The film is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits. A businessman (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a spy, and enemy agents then try to kill him because he knows too much.North By Northwest is a delightful mixture: a gorgeous-looking chase comedy-thriller with a touch of sex, a kind of compendium of director Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Grant is suave and dashing even by his own standards, and two scenes, one involving the crop-dusting plane, the other set at Mount Rushmore, will be deemed peerless for as long as cinema exists.",10,0,2,10 May 2010
The Shining," 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'
","Under the influence of a desolate hotel where murders had occurred, a caretaker (Jack Nicholson) goes berserk and threatens his family. Unlike most films by director Stanley Kubrick, which saw a slow graduated release building on word-of-mouth reputation, The Shining was released in a manner more like a mass-market film.The film is a genuinely scary ghost story that polarises opinions: devotees find it the greatest horror film ever, while naysayers deride its over-the-top histrionics. Admittedly, it gets the heart pounding, and there's a truly disturbing edge to Nicholson's performance, but between the highlights, there's not enough to maintain one's enthusiasm.",9,0,1,2 July 2010
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is solid, entertaining, gritty, sharp, and funny.
","Since a few people have asked me why I don't like Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse that much, I've decided to reveal my issues with it. First of all, I do like this film. It's easily the best wide-release film that's now playing in theaters, but I think that it's not a great film or the best Spider-Man film. The main character, Miles Morales, turns out to be one of the least appealing and least interesting characters in the film, although he's given plenty of time for character development. The most appealing character, in my opinion, is the original Spider-Man (Peter Parker or Peter B. Parker). Morales seems like a poor copy of the original Spider-Man, except that, for some reason, he also has additional, unoriginal powers like invisibility and bio-electric energy. In this case, the creators of this character just couldn't come up with a new, original superhero. This isn't surprising because hardly anything that's made by people in the American entertainment industry these days is original. Therefore, they took an old, beloved character and made him black. Morales isn't a terrible character. He's appealing, but he's lacking, in my opinion. In the film, Morales is also not a science wiz. He's simply a laid back, normal teenager, who just likes to draw and who even gets bad grades in order to transfer to a less prestigious school. Apparently, the filmmakers thought that such a character would be cool for today's audience and fine for being a superhero. This doesn't work, at least for me. Can this normal, laid-back teenager really be a superhero? Is he a good example for black teens and kids? In addition, there are, perhaps, too many Spider-Man characters and too many supervillains. A few of them are just ridiculous, though they're still kind of likable, and they add little or nothing beneficial to the film. The only character with enough development and enough appeal is, yet again, the original, Peter B. Parker. Still, even with all of this baggage, the film has several good scenes that make it worthwhile to see it again. The filmmakers can be praised because of this. But these scenes aren't enough to make Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse perfect or great. So, this is my take on Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. It's very good, it's fresh and well-animated, but it's weighed down by a few poor characterization and filmmaking choices. That's too bad. The score for this film is nine out of ten from me.When it comes to what I've been reading lately, I've been able to get my hands on a few interesting history books. The first one is 'Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World' (1869) by Nikolay Danilevsky. I don't know if this book is easily available in English now. I know that it used to be available because Carroll Quigley mentioned it in one of his books. Apparently, Danilevsky was the first man to divide the cultures that have existed in history into types, and, now that I've been able to get my hands on this book (because it's easily available in Russia now), I can see that Quigley was very much influenced by this book. It's no wonder, really, because Danilevsky's book features some brilliant writing. Another book that I've been reading is World History in 4 volumes (1887) by the German historian Oskar Jager. It's one of the books that Andrei Fursov recommends. Like Danilevsky's book, this book too is either not available in English or is difficult to find. It is readily available in Russian, however. For me, it became somewhat special because Jager's writing got me interested in the Ancient Greeks for the first time. The third rare book that I've been able to get my hands on is 'Political Equilibrium and England' (1855) by Ivan Vernadsky. It's mainly about the geopolitical struggle of the British Empire against the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Unfortunately, the copy of this book that I've been able to download is in the Russian language of the 19th century. It's not available in English and, as far as I know, it's not available in modern Russian either. I can still read the book, but this is not easy to do because there have certainly been some changes in the Russian language in the last century. Thankfully, the book isn't too thick. The one book in English that is readily available, and that I've been listening to lately on Audible, is Cosmos (1980) by Carl Sagan. I finished watching Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which is the thirteen-part television series based on the book, several months ago, and I quite enjoyed it, actually. So, I decided to get the book too, and Audible offers a very good new recording of it. The only downside to a few of Sagan's works is that they feature American oligarchical propaganda. This is something that I've noticed about other American sci-fi writers, like Isaac Asimov. In the 1970s, and especially after the fall of the Soviet Union in the late-1980s, American and British sci-fi writers began to heavily promote the Anglo-American oligarchical agenda. This agenda is about typical oligarchical fuzz, like population control, the green movement, and their geopolitical aims. I'm not really against the preservation of nature. This obviously has to be done, but the rest of the propaganda isn't really to my taste. This is also why I don't like Frank Herbert's novel Dune that much. It's undoubted that Dune is one of the best-written science-fiction novels in the English language, but the oligarchical propaganda that it contains isn't entirely to my taste. First of all, Dune is about a future that's not really progressive. In the antiquated future of Dune, the interstellar society is ruled by noble houses in control of individual planets. So, this is certainly not some futuristic, improved society that you might see in a franchise like Star Trek. It's not even a democratic society. It's a hierarchical society of nobles and royalty that very much appeals to the modern Western capitalist oligarchy. It can also be said that Dune is in tune with the environmental agenda of the Western elite, and this is why this old novel remains so popular and why it's promoted so heavily in the West. Dune was published in 1965, and, in the decades since then, the science-fiction genre in the West has largely been turned by the Western elite into a genre that promotes the environmental agenda. This is not something that I find to be very distasteful, but it is something that should be noted.",9,2,6,20 January 2019
American Beauty," A darkly comic critique of suburban stupor with a measured touch of redemption.
","A depressed suburban father (Kevin Spacey) recalls the events leading up to his own murder.Rampantly skewing the hypocrisies of bourgeois American life, the film was hailed, somewhat paradoxically, as an instant modern classic for its painterly veneer and mordant acting. It's immensely well crafted, but a lurking archness infects the tone on repeat viewings. In September 2008, Empire named American Beauty the 96th 'Greatest Movie of All Time' after a poll of 10,000 readers, 150 filmmakers and 50 film critics. The film won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography.",9,0,2,11 July 2010
Judgment at Nuremberg," It's most powerful for its subtle and shaded characterizations of both victim and victimizer.
","Many of the big name actors who appeared in the film did so for a fraction of their usual salaries because they believed in the social importance of the project. The film is a fictionalized version of the 1948 trial of the Nazi leaders for crimes against humanity.It's fashionable these days to decry director Stanley Kramer as a heavy-handed Hollywood liberal foisting his beliefs into his films, but he scored heavily with this courtroom drama about those men who enshrined Nazi tyranny as law. As a producer he gathered a brilliant, starry cast, while screenwriter Abby Mann provided an account of proceedings notable for its clarity. Yes, it's long, but this was an important historical event which the filmmakers have done justice. In doing so they have elicited some fine performances from big-name actors.",10,1,2,1 July 2010
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now resembles no other film ever made.
","In 2009, the London Film Critics' Circle voted Apocalypse Now the best film of the last 30 years. During the Vietnam War, a US captain (Martin Sheen) is sent up the Mekong river with a small crew to terminate 'with extreme prejudice' the command of a colonel (Marlon Brando) who, suffering delusions of grandeur, is ruling his own 'kingdom' in the jungle.Apocalypse Now is a fever dream of a war film, a hallucinogenic experience that aims to replicate the dislocation and hellishness of the Vietnam conflict. It's easily disparaged as an expensive folly that got out of control, both in the logistical and budgetary sense. But it remains a series of dazzling, sometimes macabre set-pieces, held together by a river journey into the unknown. Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart Of Darkness, it shares that book's sense of horror and insanity. Even the film's harshest critics would concede that it is unforgettable.",10,4,5,7 June 2010
The Patriot," The Patriot meanders down the paths of too many subplots, which detract from the film's main action.
","The film has a flag-waving dumbness at its core. After one of his sons is killed and another wounded in the War of Independence, a plantation owner (Mel Gibson) in America's South seeks revenge on the British colonel (Jason Isaacs) responsible.The Patriot is a regrettable period drama which rewrites or ignores huge swathes of history for its own ends, and reduces the complex politics of secession to a petty vengeance drama; it's not helped by Gibson's humourless, heavy-handed screen presence and an insanely long running time. The score was composed by John Williams, and was nominated for an Academy Award.",5,3,7,30 August 2010
Face_Off," The third time was the charm for director John Woo in Hollywood, as his 1997 blockbuster Face/Off reached the passionate intensity of his best Hong Kong works.
","Face/Off is a fascinating film in so many ways. A dedicated FBI man (John Travolta) has his face replaced by a terrorist's (Nicolas Cage) in a desperate bid to find a deadly bomb ticking away somewhere in Los Angeles.Travolta and Cage play ruthless rivals and then each other as this ambitious thriller goes for broke. It just about comes off amid some spectacular John Woo-trademark violence, though it can also be viewed as ludicrously, riotously funny. It was the first Hollywood film in which Woo was given complete creative control and was acclaimed by both audiences and critics as a result. Eventually grossing $245 million worldwide, Face/Off was a financial success.",8,1,2,6 May 2010
Dark City," An extremely ambitious film about the nature of the human soul, Dark City is worth seeing simply for its visual artistry.
","Dark City is a film that should get more recognition. After watching it several times I am convinced that it's one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best science fiction films ever. It flows well from scene to scene. The cinematography is gorgeous. One of the Strangers mentions that the city was created from different eras of human history. In this bustling metropolis exist vintage cars, monorails, tall old style buildings, and the people wear 1930 fashion. All this contributes to a city that is fascinating to look at. The story is also interesting. It revolves around what makes people human. Is it just our memories or is there more to it? Many human conditions are represented in the film.The characters fit in well with the story. William Hurt plays inspector Frank Bumstead, a man who's lonely and obsessed with little details. Almost all characters are played by famous actors. Jennifer Connelly plays John Murdoch's beautiful brunette wife, and there's also a woman (Melissa George), who takes a liking to Murdoch, who's a pretty blonde. What's important is that these people aren't there just for show. They all play important roles, and they're all different and well-rounded characters. There's a lot to like about the film. The score is fitting, and there are two good vocals songs; Sway and The Night Has A Thousand Eyes. Every scene is well thought-out and filmed. What I liked most about Dark City though is that it's a science fiction film noir. It's a great film too. It's more coherent than Blade Runner (1982). Dark City influenced The Matrix (1999). Both were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney using some of the same sets. Comparisons have been made between scenes from the films, making note of similarities in both cinematography and atmosphere, as well as the plot. But Dark City is a better film. I give it my highest recommendation.",8,1,8,2 May 2010
Aliens," For big-budget, high-octane showmanship, Aliens is hard to beat.
","The sole survivor (Sigourney Weaver) of the space team in Alien (1979) goes back with a Marine squadron to the mystery planet, and finds some more monsters.James Cameron took over the directing reins from Ridley Scott for this second film, and Weaver established herself as the series star. This was a vastly different, and more expensive film than its predecessor: with its dialogue-heavy first half setting up the relentless action of the remainder - a fight to the death between the aliens and their human adversaries. It's well-executed and technically brilliant, if not as memorable as Scott's effort. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly named Aliens as the second-best action film of all time, behind Die Hard (1988).",9,5,6,22 May 2010
Gandhi," Gandhi is a worshipful tribute to one of the 20th century's greatest leaders with Kingsley giving a superb performance in the title role.
","The film chronicles the life of the young Indian advocate (Ben Kingsley) who became a revolutionary, a saint and a martyr.Gandhi is a straightforward treatment with the odd twists and turns expected of director Richard Attenborough; but the remarkable things about the film are first, that it was made at all in an age which regarded inspirational epics as outdated; and secondly, that it brought into life so splendid a leading performance. Beside these factors the sluggish pace and the air of schoolbook history seem comparatively unimportant. The film was given the Academy Award for Best Picture and won eight Academy Awards in total.",10,0,2,2 September 2010
American History X," Edward Norton is absolutely riveting as the menacing skinhead at the center of American History X.
","American History X is an inflated yet gut-slugging film. The story is about a neo-Nazi skinhead (Edward Norton) who sees the error of his ways in prison, and tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) following in his footsteps.American History X is jolting melodrama about an intelligent racist, which engineers his redemption too cheaply and gets suckered by its own lyric power. The film often seems at war with itself, but that's precisely the quality that makes Norton's performance so riveting. Director Tony Kaye disowned the released version, and claimed that Norton had altered and edited the film to give his role more prominence. Still, it's a compelling and provocative story.",7,0,3,7 December 2009
Spirited Away," Spirited Away is a memorable and captivating journey, marking a high point in the director Hayao Miyazaki's career.
","Spirited Away is perhaps the Miyazaki film that appeals most to adults, and it also happens to be one of his strangest. The film views a sullen ten-year-old girl in the middle of her family's move to the suburbs and an awkward wander into a world ruled by gods, witches, and monsters; and a bathhouse for these creatures. The film received many awards, including the second Oscar ever awarded for Best Animated Feature, the first anime film to win an Academy Award. The film also won the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival. Spirited Away overtook Titanic in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history.Spirited Away happens to be my favorite Studio Ghibli film. It's also undoubtedly one of the studio's best films. It's a testament to director Hayao Miyazaki's creativity that he managed to make this masterpiece so late in his career. The animation is just gorgeous. The use of color is fresh and vibrant. All the backdrops have so much detail that even if you watch the film more than once you'll still see something that you didn't notice before. Even though the film is a fantasy Miyazaki still made it as realistically as he could. For example, when Chihiro runs, she runs realistically like a little girl. It's these little details that made me like the film even more. Even though the setting is very much Japanese it's still possible to see what influenced Miyazaki (not just in Spirited Away but in his other films too). There are American influences but there are also Russian influences. Miyazaki has stated that the 1957 Soviet film The Snow Queen is one of his inspirations to work in animation. When he started his career, Miyazaki had a rough start and was thinking of leaving animation already. When he saw The Snow Queen, he admired it and continued working in anime. In September 2007, it was announced that Studio Ghibli will be distributing this film through their Ghibli Museum Library label. The plot of Spirited Away resembles that of several popular Russian fairy tales. A girl who enters a strange land, meets strange creatures, and then manages to return home. I've seen it before. Yubaba was obviously influenced by Baba Yaga, a witch-like character in Slavic folklore (her magic, her big nose, her ability to fly like a bird, and that she's the master of some place). All this may seem strange at first, but it just adds to the uniqueness of Spirited Away. This time composer Joe Hisaishi delivers a pleasant yet beautiful score. The highlight of the soundtrack is the closing song Always With Me, performed by Yumi Kimura. As in most of his films, Miyazaki includes his thoughts on the environment, childhood, friendship, work and manners. These become good lessons in the film. In conclusion, Spirited Away easily earns a perfect rating from me. I give it my highest recommendation, and it's on my list of the top ten films.",10,2,4,20 September 2009
The Usual Suspects," A slick triumph of casting and wordplay, The Usual Suspects was one of the most fiendishly intricate American films of the 1990s.
","A story related in flashbacks, of five petty crooks, wrongly accused of a crime, who meet in a police line-up and unwittingly plan robberies together, before it dawns on them that a master criminal may (or may not) be controlling their every move.The Usual Suspects is a fabulous con-trick of a film, playfully tweaking the traditions of story-telling, raising expectations and encouraging assumptions before changing tack with dizzying grace, and finally resolving itself with an explanatory tour de force that leads audiences to question everything they have already seen. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the hangdog Roger 'Verbal' Kint, but everyone in this literal rogue's gallery plays his part. The brilliance of the story's structure encouraged a whole generation of screenwriters to emulate its feat. Commercial gold dust, in the sense that people were drawn to see it again, to pick up on the clues they missed first time round. On June 17, 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its 'Ten Top Ten'—the best ten films in ten 'classic' American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. The Usual Suspects was acknowledged as the tenth best mystery film.",9,0,0,4 February 2010
No Country for Old Men," An unsettling thriller and a statement of great concern for the future.
","It's the most measured, classical film of the Coen brothers' 23-year career, and maybe the best. In 1980, near the Rio Grande in Texas, a hunter (Josh Brolin) stumbles on a drug deal gone wrong: dead bodies, and a briefcase full of cash, which he takes. He is then hunted down by a sociopath (Javier Bardem), hired to retrieve the money, while a veteran sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) investigates the crime scene.No Country For Old Men is a pitch-perfect piece of film-making, all at one with its complex, dark subject matter: a nightmarish scenario of unfettered, unstoppable evil descending on a dry, desolate land, sweeping aside notions of decency as old-fashioned and irrelevant. As is often the case, the Coens twist and bend genre rules to their own ends, and the story crackles with dry humour and surprises: one character meets his end off screen in what, in other hands, would seem anti-climactic. Jones is the voice of decency here, a weary man nearing retirement age and fearful of an impending doom in which evil would become routine. He has good cause: as the relentless Chuigurh, Bardem is utterly terrifying. This is a remarkably assured work, stunningly photographed, with music that sounds like a light wind across an arid landscape. The Coens have never been better.",9,3,7,4 July 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Brad Pitt stars as legendary Wild West outlaw Jesse James.
","The nervy style of this newfangled Western, with its eerie, insinuating score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is so effective that long after Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck have left the screen, emotional disturbance lingers like gun smoke. The film is an account of the final years of the outlaw Jesse James, how he came to be slain by a member of his own gang, and the curious aftermath of his death.The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is ravishing looking, in muted tones that recall sepia-tinted photos, the story has a modern resonance; Affleck's grinning, sycophantic Ford is like a celebrity stalker-fan who goes to the extremes. Pitt's Jesse verges on psychosis, switching from charm to cold fury in an instant. This slow moving film, all showy vistas, field of waving corn and fast-moving clouds, aims for epic grandeur. But director Andrew Dominik also stages a night-time train robbery thrillingly. An elegy for the Old West, it is touched with brilliance throughout.",8,0,2,27 April 2010
Toy Story 4," As always, Pixar's animation excels.
","It's that time again, the time for updates, since enough time has passed. First of all, people asked me to give my opinion on the summer films of this year, and I'm not against doing this. How good are the films that have been released this summer? I'm now ready to give my take. I must admit that I've seen only several films this summer, and most of them were made by the The Walt Disney Company. But the ones that I did see didn't really disappoint me. Toy Story 4 is the best film that I saw. This film had a long development period because of the departure of John Lasseter from Pixar Animation Studios. I read about this in Animation Magazine. Because of this, and because of the fact that the film is yet another sequel to Toy Story (1995), I had the feeling that Toy Story 4 might be somewhat disappointing. But this film surprised me when I saw it because it's not only the best Pixar film since Incredibles 2 (2018). It's also one of the best Pixar films of this decade. In my opinion, the director, Josh Cooley, delivered the goods. The characters have never looked better. The voice work is excellent. The humor is frequent. And we get to find out new things about Woody and the gang. It's true that the film is formulaic, and it's yet another sequel from Pixar, but, when the film is this good, I don't feel like complaining. Still, I didn't enjoy seeing Toy Story 4 as much as I enjoyed seeing Incredibles 2. Incredibles 2 is, in my opinion, the best Pixar film of this decade, even surpassing Inside Out (2015) and Finding Dory (2016) in terms of craftsmanship. I went to see it more than once in a cinema. Can you believe that Incredibles 2 could have been even better if Brad Bird and Pixar had been given more time to make it? The film is almost perfect as it is, but it could have been even better. The only thing that weighs it down is the lack of a truly memorable villain. But, otherwise, the film is perfect, in my opinion. Thank goodness that films like this can still be made from time to time in Hollywood. Bird deserved to win a second Oscar for his work, but, because of political reasons and because he already has one Oscar, the Oscar for Best Animated Feature was instead awarded to the filmmakers of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018). By the way, I finally figured out why Into The Spider-Verse isn't an entirely satisfying film. Miles Morales, the new Spider-Man, is supposed to be the main character. But he spends almost the entire film either being a sidekick to Peter B. Parker or acting as comic relief. Only at the end of the film does he get to do something on his own, but, by that time, it's too late for any character development for him. Therefore, Into The Spider-Verse lacks a fully developed protagonist. The animation style is also something that I find to be not entirely to my liking. It makes the film seem like a gimmick at times. Anyway, I've already posted my review of Into The Spider-Verse on my blog, and I don't have to go into it in more detail. By the way, if you like the animation style of the film, I can recommend getting the art book 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - The Art of the Movie'. The only other film that I fully enjoyed seeing this summer in a cinema is Spider-Man: Far From Home. It's yet another example of Marvel's domination of the superhero genre in film form. Marvel continues to put the other Hollywood studios to shame. Even the recently released Shazam!, which is thought of by some people as the best DC film of recent years, doesn't come close to the best Marvel films. I mean, really, is it that hard to make a good action film these days? I guess that it is, especially one with plenty of special-effects. Instead of lively, enjoyable flicks, we often get dour, distasteful flicks like Venom (2018), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), or Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) from the other studios. How depressing. It seems that the only film form in Hollywood that has consistently delivered good films in the last decade is computer animation. In my opinion, Far From Home doesn't rank among Marvel's best, but it's still a good flick. Tom Holland is definitely the best on-screen Peter Parker so far. So, there you go. I enjoyed seeing two films in a theater this summer, and both of them are films from Disney. I guess this means that this summer has been disappointing when it comes to new Hollywood films. But there are other new films that I found to be... passable, though not fully enjoyable. They are Annabelle Comes Home, Detective Pikachu, Missing Link, The Angry Birds Movie 2, Pet Sematary, The Secret Life Of Pets 2, Aladdin, Us, Hobbs & Shaw, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, and Alita: Battle Angel. I saw almost all of these films long after they were released in theaters. I decided not to include The Lion King among these 'just fine' flicks because seeing it felt strange to me. Firstly, this film was made entirely using computers. There are no human actors or real locations. But the film was still made to look as realistic as possible. Maybe this means that it can't really be called an animated film, or maybe it can. It's almost a scene for scene copy of the original 1994 film. This means that there's nothing original about it except for the way it was made. The animals, since they were made to look as real as possible, aren't as expressive as in the original animated film. In addition to all of this, I saw the original animated film only a few days before I went to see the remake in a theater. All of this added together made the film a strange and unenjoyable experience for me. Still, Pumbaa did fart once. But let's move away from this somewhat depressing picture and focus on something else. The people that follow my blog should know that most of the films that I see aren't new Hollywood films. If it's a Hollywood film, it's most likely one from the 1980s or it's a so-called classic Hollywood film. Many films from Hollywood's Golden Age really are a pleasure to watch for me. These films are well-acted and optimistic. By the way, if you've read the science fiction novel Titan by John Varley, you should know that Gaea, the old alien being that Cirocco meets at the end of the story, is obsessed with watching films from Hollywood's Golden Age. I'm currently reading the book 'Majestic Hollywood: The Greatest Films of 1939' by Mark A. Vieira.",8,3,6,17 September 2019
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight lives again with Batman Begins, a stunning big-screen reintroduction that resurrects a crippled franchise.
","Batman Begins is a carefully thought out and consummately well-made piece of work, a serious comic-book adaptation that is driven by story, psychology and reality, not special effects. As a child, Bruce Wayne sees his parents killed by a criminal, and grows up uneasily to assume the mantle of crime fighter.It's easily the best Batman picture in 20 years, with director Christopher Nolan and leading man Christian Bale doing sterling work. Nolan has taken the franchise back to its basics, clinically tracing Batman's personal history and psyche. Shot on an epic scale, it's both thoughtful and exciting, though perhaps too intense and complex for kids.",8,0,0,4 May 2010
Saving Private Ryan," The film became a summertime hit despite its realistic violence and serious subject.
","During the D-Day landings, a squad of eight American soldiers is sent on a mission to rescue the sole survivor of four brothers, who is trapped behind enemy lines.The film's battle sequences, particularly the Omaha beach landing, are among the most stunningly powerful of director Steven Spielberg's career. But the episodic plotting is naggingly formulaic, and the coda in a graveyard tips this nearly great film into unfortunate mawkishness. Saving Private Ryan grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing domestic film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for eleven Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director.",10,1,2,6 July 2010
The Pianist," Another exceptional story that needed to be told.
","A talented pianist (Adrien Brody) flees the Warsaw ghetto after his family is rounded up, and attempts to stay out of the hands of the Nazis.The Pianist is a vivid Holocaust film that shows up the 'directedness' of Schindler's List (1993) by sticking closely to Wladyslaw Szpilman's first-person perspective; no museum piece, it is instead a living, breathing, haunting experience, shot through with omissions, elisions, and nagging details which refuse to be tidied up easily and thus carry an inherent aura of truth about them. The film's Babelian mix of languages and accents is a minor weakness, but it's a film where the words spoken mean so much less than the sounds heard and the sights seen: what use have we for words when faced with such indescribable horror? It won the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay.",9,1,2,29 August 2010
Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence Of Arabia is epic in every sense of the word.
","The celebrated scholar and mapmaker T.E. Lawrence's (Peter O'Toole) adventures and life with the Arabs, and the inspiration help he offered them in resisting the Turks, told in flashbacks after his accidental death in the 1930s.Lawrence Of Arabia is a sprawling epic that does full justice to its contradictory, remarkably complex hero. It's a triumph of large-scale film-making that demonstrates brain as well as budget. O'Toole is mesmerising in the title role, though the relative newcomer Omar Sharif also rose to the occasion magnificently; it's a sign of this film's power that Sharif's first entrance on screen - a long, long fixed shot as he approaches across the hot, shimmering sands, not only holds the audience's attention but is actively spell-binding. Director David Lean would never again scale such heights. The dramatic score by Maurice Jarre and the Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young are also highly acclaimed.",10,1,3,30 September 2010
City of God," A sweeping tale of how crime affects the poor population of Rio de Janeiro.
","A promising young photographer (Alexandre Rodrigues) attempts to stay out of a gang war unfolding between his contemporaries in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. In the United Kingdom the film was ranked 3rd in Film4's '50 Films to See Before You Die'.City Of God is a little too in thrall to certain American crime epics, particularly in its occasionally jokey approach to violence, but possessed of such raw, vital energy that these and other faults are liable to pass most viewers by. The result is a breakneck tour of one of the world's most forbidding neighbourhoods. In Brazil, the film garnered the largest audience for a domestic film in 2002.",8,0,1,30 June 2010
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the most solid martial arts film ever.
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon may be the best martial arts film ever. That's not necessarily because it features the best fight scenes or a lot of them, but because if features a good story and outstanding acting from the leads. It's been a long time since I've seen an action film as good as this one. Ang Lee, the director, managed to assemble a cast of some of the most famous actors from Hong Kong and China.The fictional story is set in the historic Qing Dynasty in China, in the 43rd year of Emperor Qianlong's reign (1778). Chow Yun-Fat, who's one of my favorite actors, plays Li Mu-bai who's a Wudang master of martial arts and sword fighting. He meets with his long-time friend and partner Yu Shu-lien (Michelle Yeoh), and tells her that he wants to hand over his famous sword the Green Destiny to his friend Sir Te because he wants to leave his warrior life behind but Sir Te decides to keep it for safekeeping in Beijing. In the meantime, Mu-bai intends to commemorate the death of his master, who was murdered long ago by Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-pei), a woman who sought to learn Wudang. In Beijing, Shu-lien delivers the sword and meets Jen (Zhang Ziyi), the daughter of Governor Yu, a Manchu aristocrat. Jen is destined for an arranged marriage, yet yearns for adventure; she becomes fascinated with the warrior Shu-lien. One night, a masked thief sneaks onto Sir Te's estate and steals the Green Destiny. Things go from there.The fight scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are spectacular. They were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, well known for his work in The Matrix and other films. I kid you not, at one time in the film there's a sword fight on top of bamboo trees. It's both exciting and mystical. The fight scenes are also important in the progress of the story, which is rare in martial arts films. The photography too, is beautiful. The film features a large range of places. Most of the credit should go to director Ang Lee. He said that he set out to make the best martial arts film ever, and I think that he succeeded. Made on a mere US$15 million budget, with dialogue in Mandarin, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon became a surprise international success. It grossed US$128 million in the United States alone, becoming the highest-grossing foreign-language film in American history. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and three other Academy Awards, and was nominated for six other Academy Awards, including Best Picture.",10,3,5,20 September 2009
JFK," Stone's docudrama provides its audience with a highly controversial and thought-provoking depiction of the mysterious circumstances surrounding the assassination of JFK.
","The film is a riveting marriage of fact and fiction, hypothesis and empirical proof in the edge-of-the-seat spirit of a conspiracy thriller. After John F. Kennedy's assassination, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) tries to prove that a CIA conspiracy was responsible.JFK is flagrantly speculative but inescapably gripping, thanks to director Oliver Stone's muckracking instincts and directorial verve; it certainly entertains more than it convinces, but it's increasingly hard to disentangle what's good about the film from what's just dubious. The popularity of the film led to the passage of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and the formation of the U.S. Assassination Records Review Board.",8,1,13,26 June 2010
Gone Girl," Gone Girl is disturbing, yet undeniably entertaining.
","When going to see this film I had no idea what it's about or what it'll be like. I only knew that David 'Seven' Fincher is the director of the film. Two things become clear when you're watching Gone Girl - it's surprisingly entertaining and it's for adults. Only adults will appreciate the clever humor and characterization in this film. Most people have been raving about how good Rosamund Pike is in Gone Girl. She's definitely good but, in my opinion, Ben Affleck is the one who provides the best performance. In fact, casting him was a brilliant move. Affleck does expert work as the 'lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious' Nick Dunne. With his excellent performance Affleck carries most of the film, especially the first half. The scenes that Affleck shares with Carrie Coon, who plays Nick's twin sister Margo, are some of the best in the film, easing the tension that's been building up. Coon is very good, as is the rest of the cast. Rosamund Pike, playing Nick's missing wife Amy, sure does deserve the praise that she's been given by critics. Pay attention to her facial expressions, especially in the second half of the film. Her attention to detail is commendable. She practically makes every second worthwhile. I've watched the cast interviews on the internet, and author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn has pointed this out too. I generally like British actresses, even if they are from the establishment. Pike looked terrific in her first film, the entertaining but ridiculous Die Another Day (2002), and she's delivered good performances in other films, like Barney's Version (2010) and Pride & Prejudice (2005). Pike is bewitching in the film, especially in the first half, but when it comes time to show 'amazing Amy's' or rather 'pretending Amy's' mental imbalance she's frightening. Even Tyler Perry delivers his first solid performance as Nick's attorney Tanner Bolt. The plot of Gone Girl is similar to a number of Alfred Hitchcock's films. In this mystery thriller a man is accused, maybe falsely, of a crime. What follows is compelling and often unexpected, as Fincher and Affleck examine dishonesty, the media, the economy's effects on marriage, and the way people perceive one another. For some time I couldn't figure out what the establishment message of Gone Girl is. But when I was writing this review it finally hit me - the message is that marriage is a difficult and unpleasant affair, especially after the initial 'good' days have passed. Still, I recommend this film even if it does have this anti-marriage message. It's Fincher's most entertaining release yet.",8,1,7,22 November 2014
Hellboy," Mike Mignola's acclaimed comic book series arrives on the screen in vivid form in this adaptation directed by distinctive horror filmmaker Guillermo del Toro.
","Hellboy is bizarre and loopy, romantic and dynamic. Escaping the Nazis who conjured him, a demon (Ron Perlman) grows to adulthood and joins the cause of good.The film is a darkly exuberant comic-book fantasy, whose impressive design honours the book's graphics while adding a dose of director Guillermo del Toro's own Gothic imagination; Perlman was born to play the misshapen brute of a hero. del Toro considered creating this film as a dream project for many years with casting Ron Perlman as the lead role, but could never secure a budget or studio approval. After the massive success of Blade II (2002), del Toro was offered to direct Blade: Trinity (2004) or a film adaptation of Hellboy. Though he briefly considered trying to fit both films into his schedule, he chose Hellboy.",7,0,0,9 February 2010
Good Will Hunting," Equal parts love story, coming-of-age struggle, ode to friendship, and therapy session.
","A troubled math genius (Matt Damon) working as a janitor tries to turn his life around with the help of a kindly psychologist (Robin Williams).Good Will Hunting is a cannily packaged self-help story, written by two young stars desperate to get a leg up, and handled smoothly by director Gus Van Sant, with his own sights on the mainstream. It's commercial schmaltz in indie clothing, but it wears it well.

Schindler's List," A superbly realized remembrance of European Jews who suffered genocidal persecution during World War II.
","The Austrian entrepreneur Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) starts a factory during the war using Jews as slave labour, witnesses the horrors of the Holocaust and compiles a list of over 1,100 Jews to save from death, bribing an SS commandant.Schindler's List is not a perfect film but still a masterpiece, an unforgettably moving drama on the theme of conscience, told in a stark, unflinching and consistently brave way. It is the traces of sentimentality that actually make it bearable - we watch the film not to relive the Holocaust, but to bear emotional witness to it. Director Steven Spielberg approached Billy Wilder, Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese to direct the film, worried that he would not do the story justice.",10,9,13,4 July 2010
The Incredibles," Undeniably winning Hollywood entertainment.
","A family of superheroes forced to cloak their special powers in order to get on in normal life come out of retirement to battle a new threat.The Incredibles is thrilling computer animation, as bold in its plotting and characterisation as it is studded with glorious visual detail, which stands as one of Pixar's very best; an extension of the themes of Finding Nemo (2003) - about what we do to protect ourselves and our loved ones, and what we thus prevent ourselves from experiencing - it is, after the fashion of one of its main characters, an Elastifilm, forever finding new ways to stretch itself and the medium. The film was Pixar's first feature film to win multiple Oscars, followed in 2010 by Up.",8,0,0,12 July 2010
Dog Day Afternoon," A quintessential 1970s story, devoid of unequivocal good guys and replete with public and private turmoil.
","Two robbers (Al Pacino and John Cazale) are besieged in a New York bank after their heist, the takings of which were to pay for a sex-change operation, goes badly wrong. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards and Golden Globe awards, and won one Academy Award.Dog Day Afternoon is a recreation of a tragi-comic episode from the newspaper headlines; a largely fascinating and acutely observed film, with Pacino in peak form. The film ranks 443rd on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. In 2009, it was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically' significant and will be preserved for all time.",10,0,0,14 September 2010
Amadeus," A dramatic film made by people who understand music as much as filmmaking.
","Dying in 1823, the jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) claims to have murdered Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).A musical legend performed with success and economy on stage now becomes an exciting baroque film, like an opera in high-pitched dialogue. The brilliance of its conceit is that the story is more about Salieri's mediocrity and failure in the shadow of Mozart's genius. Amadeus is lavish, spectacular, and great to look at; Hulce and Abraham never again played roles of this magnitude.Abraham appears in the 1993 film Last Action Hero. The young boy, Danny, tells Arnold Schwarzenegger not to trust Abraham, because, 'He killed Mozart!' Schwarzenegger asks, 'In a movie?' Danny responds, 'Amadeus! It won eight Oscars!'",10,1,2,23 July 2010
The Game," The Game is, just like the film that would follow it, 1999's Fight Club, a superior genre film that deserves more respect.
","The Game is an intensely exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller, the kind of film that lets you know from the start that it's slyly aware of its own absurdity. A rich control freak (Michael Douglas) receives an unusual birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn): entry into a live-action game which unfolds in the course of the player's everyday existence.The Game is a darkly comic thriller that toys skilfully with different levels of reality, asking us – like the film's hero – to question what we're seeing at every stage; the ending allows disappointingly little room for doubt, but Douglas unravels in such tremendous fashion en route that we get right behind an initially unsympathetic character. David Fincher's direction is impeccable.",6,0,2,1 May 2010
Kick-Ass," All clouds have a silver lining.
","I didn't see Kick-Ass at a movie theatre, so I don't know how audiences reacted to it. But judging by its rating here many people liked it. I liked it too, and that's because it's the most original film I've seen in a while. Its violence and sexual content will turn off some viewers though. The film centers around Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a teenager who wonders why there aren't any superheroes in real life. This thought leads him to try out being a superhero. The film's realistic approach to this is often amusing. Did I mention that there is violence? A bit of it is hard to watch on first viewing, but just when you think it's gone too far things turn around. Dave isn't really a charismatic character. The film makes up for this with Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Hit-Girl is (at least for me) the star of the film. The girl's like a Mongol; determined, inventive and a great fighter. She doesn't have a lot of screen time, but whenever she's on screen things are more interesting. Moretz is very good in the role; she has almost the same effect as Heath Ledger's Joker in the Dark Knight (2008). In addition, she swears but in her case it's just plain cool.Kick-Ass isn't just about the humour and the action. There's some good character development. Most of the fights are amazing, but the story turns out to be good and varied as well. There are thrills as well as genuine drama. The villains aren't a bunch of pushovers, so the heroes really have to give it their all here. And then there is the effective use of music. Yes, Kick-Ass has a lot going for it. Director Matthew Vaughn should get much of the credit, but every actor delivers too. Last decade's comic book and action films were obviously an inspiration on Kick-Ass, especially Spider-Man (2002) and Kill Bill (2003). However, the film's hero elements seem more effective than those of its inspirations. Because the fantasy elements are kept to a minimum here what the heroes go through really hits home. It's not easy to watch when they're in pain, but it's also thrilling when they succeed. The filmmakers smartly used this to good effect, especially in the second half of the film, which is even more exciting than the first half. And to top it all off Kick-Ass features one of the best (if not the best) uses of a bazooka in film. I recommend Kick-Ass; it even has a lot of replay value.",8,3,16,14 May 2010
Moulin Rouge!," The third film from pop-music-obsessed director Baz Luhrmann.
","Paris, the Summer of Love, 1899: a penniles writer (Ewan McGregor) falls for a beautiful nightclub courtesan (Nicole Kidman).Moulin Rouge! is a post-modern musical in which deconstructing the form subtracts more than it adds: the pop cover versions sounded better in their original versions, while relentless editing reduces the film to visual confetti; on its release in September 2001, many viewers did, however, take refuge in its camp humour, hokey, insincere romance, and dazzling costumes and sets. The film was nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture, and won two: for art direction and costume design.",9,0,2,6 July 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Shabby Spider-Man 2
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is more of the same from director Marc Webb. It's a good thing that I didn't pay to see it. Because of the film's marketing campaign and the trailers I was, for some time, looking forward to seeing this sequel. But what I saw was almost as bland and unengaging as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As was the case with the first film, the trailers for the sequel made it seem much better than it actually is. It's a cheat in a way. One of the three supervillains in the trailers isn't even an important character in the film. All the action scenes in the film were featured in the trailers. Yes, there's a shortage of action. The actions scenes are few and far between. There's also nothing particularly impressive about them. Director Sam Raimi did the same thing a decade earlier and he did it much better. In addition he made the action scenes lengthy, something that Webb still isn't capable of doing. But Webb's inexperience (or is it a lack of talent?) is evident not only in the action. It's evident in the way he directs actors. We've heard enough about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone being a couple. But does this make a difference in the film? It makes little difference really. The featured romance is typical for a superhero film. It makes you feel little for the couple, something that becomes much too obvious during an important scene. The screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner doesn't impress. At times it's poorly written. It doesn't help the romance or the proceedings. It doesn't make the characters interesting. It's formulaic. It contains unnecessary parts. These parts are a burden on the film's running time, which is 2 hours and 22 minutes. Yet we still get two underdeveloped and unmemorable supervillains. We get to know their motivations but we don't really get to know anything else about them. This is a fault of the screenplay. Jamie Foxx (Electro) and Dane DeHaan (Green Goblin) don't provide good performances with Webb's direction. In fact, the performances and even the film itself seem cartoonish at times. Also, for a film with such a large budget ($255 million), the CGI looks surprisingly underdeveloped in some scenes. There's just a lack of style in these Spider-Man movies by Marc Webb. If it wasn't for Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker it would have been a chore to sit through this film. It's not all bad though. Sometimes the actors manage to brighten up a scene. There are some genuinely funny audience-friendly bits. A good electronic score by Hans Zimmer & The Magnificent Six is a bit of an improvement over James Horner's orchestral score for the first film. But at a time when Marvel and Disney are releasing one solid superhero film after another this aimless Spider-Man reboot by Columbia seems primitive. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is only a minor improvement over the first film. Take my advice and don't see it in a movie theater. Don't get duped for a second time.",7,18,40,28 April 2014
Children of Men," A striking, affecting, and viciously beautiful tale of glimmering hope in a land of terminal despair.
","In 2027, humanity is infertile, and doomed to extinction. In Britain, immigrants are imprisoned in cages, bombings are commonplace and lawless gangs run free. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), an ex-activist and bureaucrat, is kidnapped by a resistance group and told to secure exit papers for a girl who turns out to be pregnant.Children Of Men is an electrifying, brilliantly shot film with a downbeat story that oddly contains a final glimpse of hope. It portrays a future London that is recognisable, if seedier and gloomier. Director Alfonso Cuaron stages outstanding set-pieces: a gang attacking a car containing the principal characters, an action sequence in a refugee detention camp. It's extraordinary film-making. The film has gone on to take many accolades after its release, with many critics and associations recognising it as a contemporary sci-fi classic.",9,2,13,7 July 2010
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood plays a veteran boxing trainer who has devoted his life to the ring and has precious little to show for it.
","A veteran boxing coach (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes a plucky waitress (Hilary Swank) under his wing, and trains her until tragedy strikes. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.Million Dollar Baby is a creaky, cantankerous melodrama that often feels like a round-up of Hollywood (and specifically Hollywood Irish) clichés from pictures of the 1930s and 1940s; you're meant to be distracted from the film's patronising, if not entirely contemptuous, attitude towards the lower classes by a talking-point plot twist, but even here director Eastwood pulls a lukewarm potato out of the fire only to smother it with kid oven gloves. Swank alone merits praise: her strenuously lank hair is the truest thing in the picture.",9,0,1,8 July 2010
Big Hero 6," A likable, funny and sweet film that introduces characters people will be happy to revisit.
","Big Hero 6 is a film for children but adults will easily enjoy watching this animated superhero action-comedy too. In fact, it's so entertaining that it's easy to overlook that the story is practically incoherent. The typical lessons about sacrifice and the importance of forgiveness seem forced as well. But the characters are a distinct and likable group. There's been much talk about how cute and lovable Baymax (Scott Adsit) is. And Baymax is certainly a clever creation. Considering the robotic voice of this warmhearted machine it's a big success that Adsit never makes this simple character seem repetitive or boring. Baymax is such a likable character that one genuinely begins to care about the robot long before the film is over. The other characters, however, are just as interesting. It's a formula of appealing to just about everyone in the audience. I mean, of course, the Big Hero 6 team. The genius boy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) suffers a big loss and goes on a compelling mission to find out what happened. With him are Fred (T. J. Miller), GoGo Tomago (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.) and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez). They're cool characters. In the hands of the voice cast and directors Don Hall and Chris Williams they're often funny too. In addition, the comedy is surprisingly clever, going above what's usually shown in animated fare these days. Since the film is an origins story it's actually very similar to other superhero movies if you take a closer look at what's happening. But because of the setting, comedy and action (let's also not forget the fitting music by Henry Jackman) it's easy to overlook this. The city of San Fransokyo is a futuristic metropolis that just has to be seen. Like everything else in the film it's beautifully designed. The colors are bright and the designs are fresh. I guess it's no secret that the filmmakers drew inspiration from Japanese anime and Japanese culture. John Lasseter, who's been overseeing the projects of Walt Disney Pictures for years now, is known for being a fan of Japanese animation. He's honestly managed to improve the quality of Disney films. Bolt (2008), Tangled (2010), Wreck-It-Ralph (2012) and Frozen (2013) were all terrific, memorable releases. Big Hero 6 is no different, and it may be the craftiest, most appealing release yet. I recommend it.",6,4,18,16 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," This Marvel gamble pays off more often than not.
","Guardians Of The Galaxy is, without a doubt, the weakest Marvel Studios film yet. But it's also the most charming. It suffers because of its very simple origin story. The reasons why many people overlooked this are its likable characters, sweet retro soundtrack (the songs Come And Get Your Love by Redbone and Go All The Way by Raspberries are featured at the beginning), comedy, and impressive visuals. It's really like a colorful lollipop. Once you're done with it though there's not much to return to. Sure, people liked it when Footloose (1984) was mentioned. The whole audience laughed in the theater where I watched the film. The performances by the cast are all good. Even the supporting characters are played well, reminiscent of Maximiliano Hernandez's excellent part as Jasper Sitwell in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Among the heroes it's Dave Bautista who steals the show as the angry yet honorable Drax the Destroyer. The interesting minor touches that he brought to his performance reminded me of the way Dwayne Johnson acts in some of his roles. And Bautista's bits of comedy are some of the most effective and intelligent in the film. I think that Chris Pratt was chosen to play Star-Lord because of his looks. His performance is still good though and it's clear that he's trying, sometimes seeming forced but effective. Screenwriters James Gunn and Nicole Perlman attempted to give every character time to develop, so even Groot (Vin Diesel) gets to show that he's not just houseplant/muscle by the end of the film. The raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is another well-realized CGI creation. Rocket's uneasy life and his origin made him heartless and hard to get along with, though he is the technical wizard of the team. As Gamora, Zoe Saldana isn't really the tough female character that she says she is. But she did participate in most of the action, and her performance is one of the best in the film. Lee Pace plays the main villain, Ronan the Accuser, a character that I think was tragically underused. Along with Bautista and Saldana, Pace provides the best performance in the film. This doesn't mean much, however, because Ronan has little to do and little to say. He hardly participates in the action, something that's really unforgivable for a villain in a superhero summer blockbuster. And this brings me to another problem that I have with this film. There's a lack of thrilling action. Guardians Of The Galaxy delivers the comedy and the characterization but the action is a disappointment, comprising mostly of chases. Even the predictably big final battle offers few thrills. After the action-packed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians Of The Galaxy seems tamed in comparison. Because of this I don't have an urge to see Guardians Of The Galaxy again. Despite the convoluted plot I commend director James Gunn for what he's done. It's definitely a film worth seeing because it brings something fresh to the scene.",6,1,6,8 October 2014
The Piano," Not just another costume drama, Jane Campion's The Piano lushly visualizes the emotional complexities of a 19th century woman's sexual awakening.
","The Piano is one of those rare films that is not just about a story, or some characters, but about a whole universe of feeling. The story is about a mute female pianist (Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna Paquin), set during the mid-19th century in a rainy, muddy frontier New Zealand backwater.The Piano is an unusual period piece that combines music, imagery and performance in ways that are tremendously atmpospheric; for its otherworldly seriousness, the film could be (and has been) easily mocked, and the interiority of its characters means it remains a romance easier to admire from distance than to embrace wholeheartedly. But there are grand passions beneath its starkly beautiful surface, of a kind the cinema had scarcely witnessed. The film shared the Palme d'Or as best film at Cannes in 1993; director Jane Campion became the first female film-maker to win the award. Holly Hunter won the award for best actress.",10,1,6,7 December 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," After a layoff of six years, Tarantino pulls out all the stops to serve up an entertaining shot of action cinema.
","Kill Bill is brutally bloody and thrillingly callous from first to last. Waking up after four years in a coma, an assassin (Uma Thurman) wreaks her revenge on the colleagues who betrayed her.Director Quentin Tarantino's homage to 1970s 'wuxia' martial arts flicks is little more than a slew of dazzling choreographed fight scenes, but his virtuoso technique is constantly in evidence. A self-described 'roaring rampage of revenge', Volume 1 makes good on the promise, barely pausing for breath.The overall storyline of Kill Bill — a woman seeks revenge on a group of people, crossing them off a list one by one as she kills them — is adapted from Lady Snowblood, a 1973 Japanese film in which a woman kills off the gang who murdered her family. The Guardian commented that Lady Snowblood was 'practically a template for the whole of Kill Bill Vol. 1'. Lady Snowblood was adapted from the manga of the same name written by Kazuo Koike.",8,1,4,6 May 2010
The Last Emperor," In this unprecedented Sino-Western co-production, Bernardo Bertolucci turned the strange life of final Chinese crown ruler Puyi into a sumptuous epic.
","The Last Emperor is a genuine rarity: a blockbuster that manages to be historically instructive and intensely personal at the same time. It is a biopic of Puyi (John Lone), who acceded to the throne of China as a young child, grew up to become a reformer, and was Emperor at the point his country became a republic.The film is a work of epic pageantry – rivalled only, in recent years, by late Akira Kurosawa and Farewell, My Concubine (1993) – in which the Emperor's rise to power, nimbly enacted by a trio of bright young performers, is more engaging than the decline and fall. In the age of CGI, its crowd scenes – stocked not with pixels, but living, breathing extras – have become doubly impressive.",10,0,0,16 May 2010
Black Hawk Down," A quickly forgotten chapter in United States military history is relived in this harrowing war drama.
","In Black Hawk Down American troops dropped into Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993 to capture a warlord find themselves surrounded and under heavy fire.The film is a true-life account displaying director Ridley Scott's usual meticulous attention to technical and logistical detail, to the detriment of much human interest: the soldiers are merely interchangeable pawns whose extremities are blown off at regular intervals; more regrettably, the Somali casualties are reduced to a footnote after all the flag-waving is over. The film won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Sound in 2001.",8,1,2,2 September 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The haters are wrong. Avengers: Age Of Ultron is another fantastic Marvel film.
","When I was in a movie theater waiting for Avengers: Age Of Ultron to begin playing, I had low expectations for the film. I've read the reviews online, and many people were saying that Age Of Ultron is dumb, boring and overstuffed with mindless action. In other words, they were saying that this is Marvel's first turkey. So there I was sitting and expecting the worst. After what seemed like half an hour of commercials and trailers, the film began with thrilling action, with the Avengers on a mission. During the fighting new characters were introduced and their powers were demonstrated. This set up everything that followed. I definitely enjoyed the opening act. But wait, some reviewers mentioned that there's a dull middle section after the thrilling opening. So I kept on waiting for the film to get stuck in the mud. An hour passed and Age Of Ultron continued to entertain. In fact, even though the film is over 2 hours long, the time just flies by. After an hour passed I began to realize that the reviewers were wrong or that they were judging the film harshly. I'm pleased to say that Age Of Ultron is another success for Marvel Studios. Actually, I wasn't even thinking about this much because the film kept my attention until the very end. Sure, it's a Hollywood product, but it's a Hollywood product written and directed by Joss Whedon. So Whedon once again delivered what he should have delivered - a real superhero movie. People seem to forget that Age Of Ultron is a superhero movie. It's not The Godfather (1972). It's not Chinatown (1974). And it's not serious science-fiction like Solaris (1972). It's a film based on comic book material. And it delivers what it should - action, comedy, special-effects, fantastic characters and a world under threat. By the way, Whedon delivered all this with intelligence and style. The Avengers - Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye - are as good as ever. Their interactions are witty, fun and dramatic when needed. The new characters - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - are welcome additions. They're played well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. But there's also Vision (Paul Bettany), whose role in the film is almost as important as that of the villain Ultron (James Spader). So I've got to say that this film really surprised me. It's even more entertaining than The Avengers (2012). It may not be better than the first Avengers film, but it's another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) I was a bit disappointed by Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014). After watching Age Of Ultron I had the same feeling that I got after watching The Winter Soldier - that things can only go up from here. I definitely recommend Age Of Ultron, and I can't wait to see it again myself. The battle at the end was amazing too by the way.",8,5,14,7 May 2015
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight is one of the best superhero films.
","In my opinion The Dark Knight is over-rated. It's not the best superhero film as some have said, but it is among the best. It's certainly better than Batman Begins though. The film follows Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and Police Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and their struggles and journey in combating the new rising threat of a criminal who goes by the name of the Joker (Heath Ledger). Director Christopher Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin.The Dark Knight is equal parts superhero action flick and crime drama. The action scenes are some of the most exciting that I've seen in movies in quite some time. Nolan obviously set out to make a serious film, and he succeeded. The scenery is often stunning, the direction is solid, and there are no unintended goofy bits anywhere in the film (though there is a bit of humor here and there). Christian Bale in the role of Bruce Wayne is solid again, but this time he doesn't come off as a hero you really want to root for. Wayne is your typical always right always resourceful capitalist with a fetish. In his case the fetish is bats. I never found Wayne to be an endearing character until I saw Michael Keaton's performance in the 1989 Batman film. Keaton made Wayne interesting. Bale managed to do that too in Batman Begins, but in The Dark Knight Bale's performance is overshadowed by Eckhart and Ledger. It's a good thing that Bruce has Rachel as a love interest. Maggie Gyllenhaal is better in the role of Rachel than Katie Holmes was. This time however, she has fallen for Harvey Dent (played well by Aaron Eckhart). I found Dent to be a more interesting character than Wayne in this film. And then there's Heath Ledger in the role of the Joker. Others have rightfully said that his performance is the best in the film. He's the perfect villain for these times. In fact, he's the kind of villain that some viewers can admire. The Joker is a lunatic yet he's smart, he's rebellious yet resourceful, he doesn't give a damn yet he succeeds. Ledger updates the Joker for this generation; making him into a cool villain (his smeared makeup looks wicked). Oh yes I almost forgot, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman reprise their roles. They're as good as ever, and it's great to see them again. So the casting for The Dark Knight is spot on, but what about the film itself? The film is very good. It's by no means perfect. In some parts it's thrilling in others it's almost dull. Even so the film stands up well to repeated viewings. It is a bit long though. The final part of the film is exhausting, but I think it's essential to the story. Not everything in the film makes perfect sense. I doubt than even the Joker can pull off such crime feats as he does in this film. He always manages to stay one step ahead of the good guys, and it's like he knows exactly what's going to happen. The final showdown between him and Batman wasn't to my liking too. I know the scene was about morality, but couldn't the filmmakers have made it more climactic. There's also the fact that this time hardly any effort was made to make Chicago look like Gotham City. When you watch the film it's always obvious that the film was filmed in Chicago.The Dark Knight is easily one of the best superhero movies, along with Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman (1989). However, I did not enjoy watching it as much as I did those two movies. So here you have it folks, a clear example that superhero movies aren't just for kids. I give The Dark Knight a high recommendation. If you're one of the very few people who haven't seen the film yet then don't be afraid to do so. It's smart entertainment and it doesn't disappoint.",9,1,4,20 September 2009
Into the Wild," Tell the story of a young man who is absolutely spiritually alive.
","A college graduate (Emile Hirsch) turned rootless drifter embarks on a peripatetic journey across America that ultimately finds him alone in Alaska.Into The Wild is a poignant, episodic portrait of real-life drop-out that is perhaps too taken with its subject; for the film to work one has to find him fascinating, rather than merely foolish and narcissistic. The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007. The songs on the soundtrack were performed by Eddie Vedder, guitarist and lead singer of Pearl Jam, and Jerry Hannan. Vedder won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for the song 'Guaranteed'.",8,2,4,8 July 2010
Annie Hall," Annie Hall set a new standard for romantic comedies, its name alone becoming synonymous with the sub-genre of the intelligent, New York-based romantic comedy.
","Annie Hall is perhaps the best example of Allen's early work, and one of his most popular films; winning numerous awards. In it against the neuroses of New York and Los Angeles, a Jewish comedian (Woody Allen) has an affair with a mid-western girl (Diane Keaton).The film is a semi-serious collage of jokes and bits of technique, some of the former very funny and some of the latter very successful. A hugely appealing film, it was a box-office smash, and turned its creator, of whom it is very typical, from a cult performer to a superstar. Allen had previously been known as a maker of zany comedies; the director has described Annie Hall as 'a major turning point', as it brought a new level of seriousness to his work. The narrative supposedly mirrors the real-life affair of the stars, who separated before the film came out (Keaton's family name is Hall).",10,1,2,17 December 2009
Toy Story," Toy Story was the first feature-length film animated entirely by computer.
","It's a deceptively simple story 'peopled' with charming, funny, and well-realised characters and highly enjoyable fare for anyone who ever owned a toy. A toy astronaut (Tim Allen) refuses to accept that he is simply a plaything and becomes the favourite of a small boy - which makes his previous preferred toy (Tom Hanks), a cowboy, deeply jealous.Toy Story is a sensational animated feature, a milestone in this specific genre. It was the first such film to be completely computer-generated, and fully exploited this technological advance to the maximum to tell its tale with great humour and conviction. A rare 'family film' that everyone in the family will genuinely enjoy; adults for its sophisticated charm, and children for its affectionate, imaginative fantasy about what toys get up to when humans leave the room.",10,0,0,25 June 2010
Men in Black," So much fun that it's one of the rare films which actually raises hopes for a sequel.
","A young cop (Will Smith) is recruited by a top-secret government organization charged with monitoring the behaviour of alien life forms on Earth.Men In Black is a lively, fast-moving event film that takes great care not to drown the engaging human players under its layers of (often witty) out-of-this-world effects. It received an overwhelmingly positive response from critics, and was followed by a 2002 sequel, Men In Black II. Following the film's release, Ray-Ban stated sales of their Predator 2 sunglasses (worn by the organization to deflect neuralyzers) tripled to $5 million.",6,0,0,29 August 2010
The Graduate," The film became a landmark in the cinema of hip, New Wave, antiestablishment disillusionment.
","A young California man (Dustin Hoffman) from a wealthy family, recently graduated, has no idea what to do with his life or how to meet his parents' expectations. He is led into an affair with an older woman (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's best friend, then falls in love with her daughter (Katharine Ross).Richly reflecting the disenchanted, anti-careerist mood of young people in the late sixties, this lushly-filmed sex comedy, surprisingly faithful to its excellent, concise source novel, opened a few new doors, looked ravishing, was well acted and had a popular music score. It also conferred instant stardom on Hoffman, who was older than his character: he was 30 when it opened. The Graduate is a comedy of its time, it has also stood the test of time. Adjusted for inflation, the film is #19 on the list of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada.",10,1,1,28 June 2010
Singin' in the Rain," Full of delightful in-jokes about its subject and the people who lived through the era.
","Although it was a big hit when first released, it was not accorded its legendary status by contemporary critics. It is now frequently described as one of the best musicals ever made. When talkies are invented, the reputation of one female star (Jean Hagen) shrivels while another (Debbie Reynolds) grows.Singin' In The Rain is a brilliant comic musical, the best picture by far of Hollywood in transition, with the catchiest tunes, the liveliest choreography, the most engaging performances and the most hilarious jokes of any musical. The film has appeared twice on Sight and Sound's list of the ten best films of all time, in 1982 and 2002.",10,0,1,9 July 2010
Elysium," Elysium is an exciting, emotionally involving action-thriller.
","Elysium is the most original science fiction film of this year. Writer/director Neill Blomkamp delivers a gritty and seemingly realistic vision of the future. In the year 2154 the very wealthy live on a luxurious space station called Elysium, and the poor live on an overpopulated, devastated Earth. I didn't find the setting very appealing but there's enough there for an entertaining action-thriller. Matt Damon doesn't play a typical hero. In fact, at times, I didn't feel compassion for him. This, I'm sure, was Damon's and Blomkamp's intention and by the end Max Da Costa goes through big changes. This approach is commendable but I didn't find it very interesting. Still, the ending is a triumph as Max redeems himself in a big way and manages to change the world. As a child Max gazes longingly at the picturesque space station above while dreaming of one day escaping Earth with his best friend Frey (Alice Braga). This impressive image works wonderfully in the emotionally-charged ending that will definitely make viewers think. In this way Elysium is structured similarly to Blomkamp's debut film District 9 (2009). Elysium isn't as big a triumph as District 9 but it comes very close. This time Blomkamp has a more experienced cast to work with. Jodie Foster provides a good performance as the power-hungry, cunning Jessica Delacourt. Sharlto Copley's C.M. Kruger is a rather frightening creation. Another name worth mentioning is Wagner Moura as Spider. Moura's performance turns the determined Spider into more than just a shady employer. At times he's even more sympathetic than Damon. The film's intense action sequences are aided by excellent CGI. Blomkap's talent for showing inventive weaponry and striking visuals is again present in Elysium. Moreover, just as in District 9, there's a good underlying political message. In this sharp disparity between wealthy and poor one man can make a difference. In conclusion, with Elysium Blomkamp delivers another innovative satisfying science fiction film that's well worth seeing. I definitely recommend it.",8,5,9,26 August 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," This is Leone's gangster film to end all gangster films, a work of tremendous intellectual depth and emotional range.
","It is, finally a heart-breaking story of mutual need. By matching that need with his own need to come to terms with his own cultural memories, director Sergio Leone has made his most oneiric and extraordinary film. The story chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, greed, betrayal, loss, violence, the passage of time, broken relationships, and the appearance of mobsters in American society.Once Upon A Time In America is a vast, sprawling, violent crime saga with a neat circularity about its rags-to-riches-to-rags narrative. It is operatic in style, often brutal in tone, nostalgic in mood and mesmerising to watch. A stunning, towering achievement, not afraid to stray into lurid territory when the plot demands it, that taps into audiences' guilty fascination with dangerous, sociopathic characters. James Woods and Robert De Niro could hardly be improved upon, and Ennio Morricone's score is exquisitely fitting. The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival in April and, according to Howard Hughes' book Crimewave: A Film-goer's Guide to Great Crime Movies, received a '15 minute standing ovation'.",10,3,7,11 December 2009
Avatar," Despite any nitpicky flaws - one might or might not - find within the picture, Avatar is absolutely a touchstone.
","Avatar is another special effects extravaganza from director James Cameron. A lot of money was spent on making this film, but it payed off. Avatar is now the most successful film ever. Though I didn't like the film a lot I still thought it was impressive on the technical level. The problem is that it's not as gripping as some of Cameron's other films like Aliens or Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Avatar turns out to be Dances With Wolves, but in space.The special effects are amazing. The CGI makes the world of Pandora come alive. There's some breathtaking scenery in the film. The actors were good in their roles. Sam Worthington as Sully is effective in the leading role. I especially liked Stephen Lang in the role of Quaritch. I also liked the film's message. The script does not impress though, and parts of the film just don't entertain. There's so much CGI that for a while I yearned to see something normal. Thankfully the many millions of dollars spent on making Avatar were spent wisely. This film is so much better than, let's say, Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen. Overall Avatar is a good and entertaining science fiction epic. I recommend it.",7,2,6,26 April 2010
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2 narrowly escaped straight-to-video status.
","Toy Story 2 is a great, IQ-flattering entertainment, both wonderful and wise. A cynical, greedy toyshop owner steals the cowboy Woody in order to cash in by selling a complete set of toys to a Japanese museum.This cleverly crafted sequel, which did not quite emulate the scintillating script or the wondrous technical surprise of its brilliant predecessor, remains exceptionally entertaining. Randy Newman wrote two new songs (When She Loved Me and Woody's Roundup) for Toy Story 2 as well as the complete original score. On June 12, 2010, in its broadcast on Disney Channel, the film received 7.479 million viewers, making it the number one show or film of the week.",10,0,1,25 June 2010
Chariots of Fire," A handsomely realized and superbly acted story about the multi-faceted drive to win.
","In the 1924 Paris Olympics, angst-ridden, Jewish Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and devout Scot Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) compete for Britain.Chariots Of Fire is a film of subtle qualities, rather like those of a BBC classic serial. In Colin Welland's thoughtful script, both men encounter and overcome prejudice and adversity, and find their own kinds of victories. It was a surprise Oscar winner, but in fairness, all the elements are in place: some classic scenes (including the slow-motion dawn training session on the beach) - and Vangelis's throbbing electronic score, which surprisingly suits the material to perfection. The film is ranked 19th in the British Film Institute's list of Top 100 British films.",9,2,2,10 July 2010
Life Is Beautiful," Life Is Beautiful caused more than a little controversy when it was released.
","A Jewish father (Roberto Benigni) in the concentration camps pretends the events he witnesses are all part of a game, in order to better preserve the innocence of his young son (Giorgio Cantarini). The film was financially successful, earning 23 million euro in Italy. In the United States, the film earned $59 million.Life Is Beautiful is the most reviled film ever to have been made with the best of intentions: for those whose analytical brains overruled their sobbing mechanisms, this Holocaust fantasia committed several gross lapses in taste, historical accuracy and basic human decency. Its take on the camps is an original one, to say the least, though it doesn't finally confront the horrors therein so much as run away and hide from them.",8,0,3,30 June 2010
Up," A feisty septuagenarian teams with a fearless wilderness ranger to do battle with a vicious band of beasts and villains in this computer-animated adventure.
","Up is another must-see animated film from Pixar Animation Studios. It's about a cranky old man and an overeager Scout who fly to South America in a floating house suspended from helium balloons. Up is director Pete Docter's (Monsters, Inc.) second feature-length film, and features the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, Bob Peterson and Jordan Nagai. It is the first Pixar film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.Up is definitely one of the better Pixar efforts. It's about the grandeur and excitement of flight and adventure. The first ten minutes of the film about Carl Fredricksen and his life-long love Ellie are surprisingly touching. It's heartbreaking to see him lose his wife even at old age. With nothing left to do Fredricksen heads for South America, but he's not alone. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his 'Assisting the Elderly' badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. The relationship of father and son that forms between Fredricksen and Russell is completely believable. The filmmakers certainly know how to make a film with endearing characters. The animation is gorgeous. Several scenes in Up are some of the most memorable that I've ever seen in animated films. Like other Pixar films Up is also very funny. Thankfully, it's sweet humour instead of the gross humour that's present in many of today's Hollywood films. In conclusion, Up is another daring, unusual and beautiful animated film from Pixar that both children and adults will enjoy watching. I highly recommend it.",8,0,3,20 September 2009
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray plays Phil, a TV weatherman working for a local station in Pennsylvania but convinced that national news stardom is in his grasp.
","Groundhog Day is first and foremost a comedy of ideas, on which score it never falters. A cynical weatherman (Bill Murray) must relive the same day over and over again until he sees the error of his ways.A peerless conceit actually benefits from the comparatively bland, sitcom-ish direction - the main character seems trapped in the same banal episode of his life, and not even suicide works as a way out. It's the role of Murray's career and the most inspired comedy of the 1990s. In 2006, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.'",9,1,3,9 February 2010
Reservoir Dogs," A study in violence and pop hoodlum cool.
","A gang's robbery of a jewellery store goes disastrously wrong, and as one of them bleeds to death, the others try to establish which one of them is a police informer.Reservoir Dogs is an electrifying directorial debut by Quentin Tarantino: a tense, almost hysterical gangster film stuffed with colourful vernacular, male posturing, deadpan humour and jaw-dropping violence. Its influence on other young film-makers would prove inestimable. It was named 'Greatest Independent Film of all Time' by Empire. Although it was never given much promotion upon release, the film was a modest success at the box-office.",10,0,0,8 July 2010
Total Recall," They stole his mind. Now he wants it back.
","The film won a Special Achievement Academy Award for its visual effects. In 2084, a construction worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has a dream and remembers he had a previous existence as a secret agent on Mars.Total Recall is an over-excitable, science-fiction fantasy film that introduces bone-crunching violence when it stumbles over its overlapping ideas. The plot takes dizzying turns at regular intervals, as it tries to keep up with Philip K. Dick's overstuffed original story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale. But the film can be watched as an effects-driven spectacle, its themes reduced to background incidental mood music. Under such circumstances, if you've half a mind to watch, that's all you'll need.",7,0,4,26 March 2012
Rocky," An unashamed feel-good movie.
","The film tells the rags to riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), an uneducated but kind-hearted debt collector for a loan shark in Philadelphia. Rocky starts out as a club fighter who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship when the scheduled contender breaks his hand.Rocky is an uplifting, likable underdog film that came after a traumatic decade for America, with an apparently average Ordinary Joe for a hero, a character who might have been a minor sidekick in an urban pre-war film. Stallone wrote himself a part with grit, wit and a little self-deprecation, and showed an indomitability in getting it made that recalled Rocky's unlikely rise through the ranks.",10,1,1,8 July 2010
Pretty Woman," One of the most unexpected blockbusters of the early 1990s.
","In Los Angeles, a successful asset stripper (Richard Gere) is charmed by a perky prostitute (Julia Roberts) he hires for a night as an escort, invites her to spend a week with him, and falls for her.Pretty Woman is a modern fairy tale with shades of Pygmalion, so deftly written and directed and with such a radiant lead actress that it became a huge hit. One can find fault with the dubious sexual politics on display here, but it says much for Roberts's overwhelming screen charm that audiences have overlooked that aspect of the story. This was the role that kick-started, and even defined her stellar career. The film was followed by a string of similar romantic comedies, including Runaway Bride (1999), which re-united Gere and Roberts under the direction of Garry Marshall once again.",8,1,2,18 July 2010
Pulp Fiction," Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American film of the 1990s.
","Brilliantly written and unfathomably cool, this would make a good case for most quotable crime film of all time. Interlocking stories from the seedy side of Los Angeles include ruthless hit men, a gangster's beautiful wife with a roaming eye and a boxer who refuses to take all.Pulp Fiction is the defining film of the 1990s, playfully mixing up its chronology, packed with memorable, snappy, cute dialogue and showing a genuine zest for the art of film-making. Director Quentin Tarantino's film-literacy, learned obsessively during his stint as a video-store assistant, pays off handsomely here; almost every line is quotable, a sense of fun pervades, there's a host of delightful set-pieces (including John Travolta's and Uma Thurman's sexy dance) and generous screen time is given to characters rarely considered at length in film, such as Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's stolid hit men. Briefly, Tarantino shone brighter than anyone else in the industry, and this film justifies his accolades.",10,4,9,25 June 2010
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Guy Ritchie's directorial debut Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is a work of artistic originality as well as an accurate portrayal of life as an Eastender.
","Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is too mixed-up to synopsise easily and too rickety to think about closely, but it gets plenty of laughs as it rushes from scene to scene. The story is about a heist involving a self-confident young card sharp who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three card brag. In order to pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door.This crime caper has not a great deal of originality or heart, but displays an undeniable energy as its cast of memorable faces duck and dive between narrative entanglements. Unhappily, its massive success opened the floodgates to a wave of dismal British gangster movies. A television series, Lock, Stock..., followed in 2000.",7,1,4,11 December 2009
Three Colors: Blue," This effort representing 'Liberty' is a deliberately paced but rewarding look at the process of mourning and redefining one's life after personal tragedy strikes.
","The rehabilitation of a human spirit after painful tragedy is given stunning, aesthetic dimension here. Shocked by the death of her composer husband and their young daughter in a car crash, a woman (Juliette Binoche) destroys his final work, but draws back from killing herself.Three Colors: Blue is the first part of director Krzysztof Kieslowski's magisterial trilogy and its a harrowing experience, as Binoche's Julie first attempts suicide, then strives for the freedom to cope with her suffering by retreating within herself. Discreetly, brilliantly and closely observed.",9,1,2,20 May 2010
The Untouchables," A strikingly authentic re-creation of 1930s gangster films and Prohibition-era Chicago.
","The Untouchables is time honoured mayhem in the windy city. The story is about law enforcers in 1920s Chicago who go after Al Capone and other mobsters.The long-running TV show is given a new polish in this showy, violent and widely popular gangster picture. Director Brian De Palma stages some spectacular sequences, most famously a re-creation of the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin (1925), but at a railway station. It looks lavish, Ennio Morricone's score ensures it sounds wonderful and David Mamet reins himself in with some crisp, pointed dialogue. Kevin Costner's stardom was confirmed by his portrayal of Eliot Ness, while Robert De Niro as a menacing Al Capone and Sean Connery as a veteran cop lend first-class support. The film is a hugely entertaining treat.",9,1,4,16 May 2010
The Godfather: Part III," After a break of more than 15 years, Coppola and writer Mario Puzo returned to the well for this third and final story of the fictional Corleone crime family.
","While attempting to conclude a real-estate deal with the Vatican that might confer legitimacy on his business affairs, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is distracted by the behaviour of his violent and ambitious nephew (Andy Garcia).The Godfather Part III is the greatest anti-climax in American cinema: a plodding third installment that makes mistakes and poor choices from the word go, compounded by director Francis Ford Coppola's sudden lack of confidence around set-pieces and actors. Some small pleasure can be taken from seeing the loose ends tied up, but if this was a Corleone brother, it'd be the sickly Fredo, the one you want to see put out of his misery as soon as possible. Part III has received mixed reviews and receptions, but nevertheless grossed $136,766,062 and was nominated for seven Academy Awards.",8,1,2,17 May 2010
Mystic River," A mournful and effective murder mystery.
","The film works as a straight-up detective story, and the acting is often breathtaking. Three childhood friends from Boston share a dark secret from their youth. Their lives intersect again when an innocent young girl is murdered.Mystic River is a sinister, brooding story with a strong sense of place. Despite its failed aspirations to tragic grandeur, it succeeds as a whole, thanks to some fine acting in the lead roles, and director Clint Eastwood's ability to maintain dramatic tension. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards. Sean Penn won Best Actor and Tim Robbins won Best Supporting Actor.",9,0,1,26 June 2010
A Beautiful Mind," He saw the world in a way no one could have imagined.
","A Beautiful Mind is consistently engrossing as an unusual character study and as a trip to the mysterious border-crossing between rarified brilliance and madness. It's a Hollywood biopic of maths genius John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe), whose brilliant career was blighted by schizophrenia and paranoid delusions.The film ascribes a great deal less intelligence to its audience than it does to its subject, approaching his life through a prism of dubious narrative gimmickry and with much overrated acting. A feeling of Oscar-grab mendacity is hard to shake off. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life.",8,0,1,26 March 2012
The Departed," Legendary director Martin Scorsese takes the helm for this tale of questionable loyalties and blurring identities set in the South Boston organized crime scene.
","The Departed is director Martin Scorsese's most purely enjoyable film in years, but it's not for the faint of heart because it's rude, bleak, violent and defiantly un-PC. A young criminal (Matt Damon) is ordered by a Boston mobster (Jack Nicholson) to operate undercover within the state police, while a young cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the mobster's gang.Scorsese has made half a dozen better films, but finally he has his Oscar and Academy voters have spared their own blushes. Yet this is worth the plaudits: a great crime thriller with a deft, relentless plot that grips throughout. It vastly improves the 2003 Hong Kong thriller Internal Affairs, clarifying a complex story and adding subtlety to characters. Scorsese coaxes superlative work from his actors: DiCaprio and Damon are at their peak, Mark Wahlberg is a real surprise in a relatively minor role, and Nicholson's profanely funny mobster Frank Costello marks his best work in years. Superbly staged set-pieces add to the film's visceral appeal; it's both a hoot and kick in the guts.",9,0,4,5 February 2010
Die Hard," Die Hard introduced the working-class hero.
","The film has great pace, great gun battles, great fun. A New York cop (Bruce Willis) battle with terrorists who have dared to derail his planned reconciliation with his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) by occupying a skyscraper and taking hostages.First-rate special effects, sharp one-liners and enthralling action make Die Hard a memorable if overlong film. At the time, it was a state-of-the-art action thriller. But subtle it is not. The film spawned three sequels, all starring Willis, in the two decades after its release. McClane's catchphrase 'Yippee kai yay, motherf****r' was voted as #96 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere magazine in 2007.",8,1,3,3 July 2010
Psycho," Psycho is still frightening after all these years.
","Psycho is probably the most visual, most cinematic picture director Alfred Hitchcock has ever made. At a lonely motel, vicious murders take place and are attributed to the manic mother of the young owner.The film is a curious shocker devised by Hitchcock as a tease and initially received by most critics as an unpleasant horror piece in which the main scene, the shower stabbing, was allegedly directed not by Hitchcock but by Saul Bass. After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years; despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script, yet it remains a hugely successful confidence trick, made for very little money by a TV crew. Psycho spawned two sequels, a prequel, a remake, and an unsuccessful television spin-off.",10,0,3,5 February 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," Screenwriter Nora Ephron has constructed an incisive tale that manages to combine brilliant zingers with deep, lasting reflections on relationships.
","When Harry Met Sally... is destined to join Annie Hall, The Graduate, Alfie and a few others of that ilk, films which are guaranteed a long shelf life as TV movies because of the way they imperfectly frame the sexual dilemmas of their time. And make us laugh. Two long-standing acquaintances (Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan) wonder if it's possible for men and women to enjoy, friendship without sex.The film is a very talky, slightly cynical examination of that particular quandary - something like three-quarter strength of Woody Allen - though not without good lines and appealing performances. The film is 23rd on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on Bravo's '100 Funniest Movies'.",9,0,0,6 May 2010
All Quiet on the Western Front," One of the most powerful anti-war statements ever put on film.
","The film is considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in World War I. In 1914, a group of German teenagers volunteer for action on the Western Front, but they become disillusioned, and none of them survives.All Quiet On The Western Front is a landmark of American cinema and Universal's biggest and most serious undertaking until the 1960s, this highly emotive war film, with its occasional outbursts of bravura direction, fixed in millions of minds the popular image of what it was like in the trenches, even more so than Journey's End (1930) which had shown the Allied viewpoint. Despite dated moments, it retains its overall power and remains a great pacifist work.",10,2,3,22 May 2010
There Will Be Blood," A film about an oil pioneer whose trailblazing spirit is equaled only by his murderous ambition.
","There Will Be Blood is a creation myth for American capitalism, blazingly mounted against barren California landscapes. In 1898, prospector Danial Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) strikes silver. It marks the start of his rapidly growing empire and his move into the oil business. He and his young son H.W. (nominally his partner) visit a tract of land in California, said to be oil-rich. On striking oil, Plainview crosses swords with a young local preacher (Paul Dano) who disapproves of his voracious greed.The film is a historical epic that has the power of timeless myth, a story with Biblical overtones about a man who became immensely rich and powerful but lost his humanity on that journey. Day-Lewis's portrayal of Plainview, a solitary misanthrope with an appalling, barely concealed fury, is an astonishing master-class in acting. Dano as the young preacher Eli - calm but smug and manipulative makes an effective foil. But it's writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's conception that carries the day; he has fashioned a story that surveys the well-spring of American business and entrepreneurialism and finds it morally wanting. This is an angry, roaring discordant film, and you emerge feeling genuinely jolted.",9,2,4,25 June 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Ranks as one of the greatest films of all time and arguably director David Lean's best film.
",British prisoners of war in Burma are employed by the Japanese to build a bridge; meanwhile British agents seek to destroy it. The film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.The Bridge On The River Kwai is an ironic adventure epic with many fine moments but too many centres of interest and an unforgivably confusing climax. It is distinguished by Alec Guinness's portrait of the English Colonel who is heroic in his initial stand against the enemy but finally can not bear to see his bridge blown up: and the physical detail of the production is beyond criticism.,10,1,3,9 September 2010
A Hard Day's Night," Working within a tight $500,000 budget, director Richard Lester turned out A Hard Day's Night in a fast 6 1/2 weeks.
","A Hard Day's Night is a fine conglomeration of madcap clowning... with such a dazzling use of camera that it tickles the intellect and electrifies the nerves. Harassed by their manager and Paul McCartney's grandpa, the Beatles embark from Liverpool by train for a London TV show.The film is a comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with director Richard Lester trying every cinematic gag in the book, it led directly to all the kaleidoscopic Swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties - and to the prevailing tone of pop videos decades later. At the time it was a breath of fresh air, and its playful, low-budget style, shot in black-and-white and clearly influenced by the French New Wave, faithfully captured the group's irreverent attitude to their fame, the media, and even themselves. The film was successful both financially and critically; it was rated by Time magazine as one of the all-time great 100 films.",10,7,9,9 February 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Its resigned yet hopeful portrayal of spirited non-conformity touched a nerve.
","A charismatic rebel (Jack Nicholson) in a psychiatric hospital enlists the help of his fellow patients in stirring up trouble against the authorities, personified by a dictatorial nurse (Louise Fletcher).One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a wildly and unexpectedly commercial film of a project which had lain dormant for 14 years, this amusing and horrifying work captured the dissident spirit of its time, with a beguiling central performance from Nicholson that immediately marshals audience sympathy. Impeccably thought through in every department, it swept all the major Academy Awards, and understandably so: it's impossible to ignore. In 1993, this film was deemed 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant' by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.",10,0,2,18 September 2010
Edge of Tomorrow," This gripping and well-acted science fiction film leaves an impression.
","Edge Of Tomorrow is definitely one of the must-see films of this year. Director Doug Liman infused this military science fiction story with his distinct action style. But as good as the film is (I can even call it inspired) it's still dragged down by Liman's lack of artistry and his inability to create a clear narrative. Edge Of Tomorrow is a good-looking film. At times there's some very impressive imagery, especially in the action scenes. Shots of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) come to mind. But, overall, there isn't much to look at except for the metal suits. The film starts out rather slowly as the viewers are introduced to an alien threat (the Mimics) and what is being done to fight them. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is there from the beginning, though his character becomes interesting only later. The story begins developing once Blunt is on screen. She's magnetic in her role as Rita and clearly the best feature of the film. This is one tough woman that one can actually admire. She looks like a heroine but, in addition to her determination, Blunt also brings some vulnerability to the character. This shows that there's more to her than being a soldier. I didn't really expect Blunt to deliver a good performance. Her previous work in Hollywood films didn't show much. I haven't seen any of her work in English productions. Edge Of Tomorrow is an American film but for some reason it takes place in England and in Europe. Almost all of the characters are English. The film clearly reaches its peak in the middle. That's when the best most exciting action occurs. That's when Cruise's character begins to develop. That's when the story gets most interesting. The Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka was the inspiration for Edge Of Tomorrow. Surprisingly, except for the main characters, there aren't many changes from the light novel. The story is basically the same. William Cage (Keiji Kiriya in the light novel) gets caught in a time loop where he wakes up one day in the past after having been killed on the battlefield. Cruise is playing against type here because his characters is a coward for most of the film. The repetitious concept is used as a means of exploring the protagonist's deeply flawed nature and reluctant push for self-improvement. As for the other characters, I could care less about them. Time is spent on developing them too, but they're not a memorable or even a likable bunch. Because of its action and sense of urgency Edge Of Tomorrow is similar to The Bourne Identity (2002), which is another Liman film. However, it also contains some humor, making it seems similar to Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) too. It's better than both of those good-but-flawed films, so it's a summer release that I definitely recommend.",7,0,2,8 July 2014
Downfall," Downfall succeeds in painstakingly depicting who did what when.
","Claustrophobic, tense and often riveting Oliver Hirschbiegel's film is no sensational shockfest, but a living, breathing historical re-creation of Adolf Hitler's downfall. After World War II, Hitler's vivacious secretary Traudl Junge recalls the last grim days in the Berlin bunker before the leader of the Third Reich killed himself, as Russian troops advanced on the city.Downfall is a fascinating film, featuring arguably the best portrayal on film of Hitler, by Bruno Ganz. It charts the delusional hysteria in the bunker with clinical clarity, yet the film has the same vulgar, voyeuristic appeal as the best reality TV: Eva Braun and her friends are literally seen dancing on table-tops and swigging champagne, trying to blot out the prospect of utter defeat and certain death. In contrast, a scene showing Magda Goebbels efficiently poisoning her young children is memorably chilling. Altogether, a superb re-creation of events. The film created controversy in Germany for its calm, neutral, non-judgemental portrayal of the Third Reich's leading players.",8,1,2,17 December 2009
It Chapter Two," Small gripes aside, there's enough to love about It: Chapter Two to satisfy anyone's inner cynic.
","N an earlier post, I wrote about how only two films that were released in theaters during the summer pleased me. They're Toy Story 4 and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Well, Avengers: Endgame played in theaters during the summer too, but I don't consider it to be a very good film. There were also several other summer movies that I kind of like. So, when it comes to new Hollywood films, it wasn't a good summer or a bad summer. It was an average summer. I mean, one can't expect an excellent new film to be released every week. Who would have the time to go to a theater every week? This isn't realistic. Well, anyway, after the summer movie season came to an end, Hollywood quickly released several enjoyable films that make the summer movie season pale in comparison to this autumn movie season. I haven't seen every film that has been released in the autumn yet, but I can say that Terminator: Dark Fate, Zombieland: Double Tap, Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, and Abominable are worth seeing. Most are so good that they can be seen more than once. I'd also like to see 21 Bridges, Charlie's Angels, Frozen 2, and Jojo Rabbit. Joker is a film that I think isn't worth seeing more than once. It's not a bad film. For a modern film, it's good, but the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired. I mean, it's no Apocalypse Now (1979). That's for sure. There are a few moments of brilliance in Joker, but, for the most part, it's a rather dull film, and I'm not judging it based on its message or content. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is good, but not extraordinary. The cinematography doesn't look very good. Most of the scenes in the film aren't interesting. And the direction, though certainly better than average for modern times, isn't very good either. What did surprise me is how much I enjoyed seeing It Chapter Two and Doctor Sleep. I don't think that these films are very good, but they're better than I expected them to be. In It Chapter Two, the director, Andy Muschietti, showed more of his artistic side, as he did in his fine horror film Mama (2013). It Chapter Two is more atmospheric, better shot, and features better acting than It (2017). And it doesn't rely as much on silly jump scares. All of this added together made it a more enjoyable film for an adult like me. But the film still suffers from the fact that, like It, it was made to appeal to as large an audience of modern moviegoers as possible. Doctor Sleep is another well shot and atmospheric film that was directed by Mike Flanagan, who directed the fine horror film Oculus (2013). As a film, Doctor Sleep is kind of enjoyable. The novel by Stephen King is, in my opinion, bloated and rather dull. Still, the film isn't much better because there's nothing about it that stands out. The acting is fine, but not great. The story is fine, but not very interesting. The cinematography is good, but not in any way truly appealing. The music isn't memorable. Some of the scenes are good, but most of the scenes are just passable. By the way, one of the horror films that I really enjoyed seeing lately is Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh (1995). It's better than I expected it to be. The first film, Candyman (1992), is, in my opinion, fantastic when it comes to its artistry. It's easily one of the best horror films of the 1990s. When I was thinking about it, I thought that it must be the best of the 1990s, but then I remembered that Scream (1996) was released in the 1990s too. Scream is overall a slightly better film than Candyman. With Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh, the filmmakers at least attempted to make a good film, and in some ways they succeeded. It's obviously inferior to Candyman, but the acting, the cinematography, and the direction still make it worth seeing. And, finally, I'm almost done with my Marvel Cinematic Universe marathon, which I began in May of this year, when I watched Iron Man (2008) again. From then on, I've been watching every MCU film in order, and I'm still not quite finished. Of course, it hasn't been an obsession with me because I haven't been watching the films one after the other all in one sitting. I've seen many other films in this time period too. In this way, I've now seen every MCU film at least twice, and I don't consider this to be a bad thing because MCU films are good. There still hasn't been a single bad MCU film. Quite impressive. The years 2018 and 2019 are particularly memorable in the history of the MCU because Marvel released four fantastic films one after the other. They're Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man And The Wasp, and Captain Marvel. When I watched these films again on home video I noticed how well made they are. The acting is good. The stories are interesting. The music is fitting. The entertainment factor is high. The special effects are excellent. Need I say more? I can say that by the time Phase Three began in the MCU, Marvel truly found its groove.",6,1,5,6 December 2019
The Green Mile," This stilted supernatural yarn pushes viewer endurance at more than three hours, without the finely tuned attention to character that made Shawshank so memorable.
","The Green Mile is a cracking good yarn that earns its laughter, its wonder and its tears. The story is about a retired prison warden (Tom Hanks) who recalls the time during the Depression when a black inmate (Michael Clarke Duncan), accused of murdering two white girls but blessed with healing powers, arrived on Death Row.The film is a long, often simplistic but engrossing drama that handles human interest material better than its supernatural aspects; though it can't quite reproduce on celluloid the smell of burning flesh or the agonies of passing kidney stones - both central to the plot - it at least shares one thing with its source: a deep-rooted, fundamental commitment to storytelling. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.",6,1,4,9 February 2010
The Lion King," The Lion King became the ruler of Disney's vast jungle, far outgrossing any of the studio's previous releases.
","Upon the death of his father, the Lion King, a young cub is exiled from the jungle by his wicked uncle, who plans to ascend to the throne himself.The Lion King is reliably entertaining Disney animation that provides grown-up drama - loosely based on the plot of Hamlet - and, for light relief, excellent comic sidekicks and some memorable songs. The film still holds the record as the highest grossing traditionally animated film in history and belongs to an era known as the Disney Renaissance. Certain elements of the film bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s Japanese anime television show, Kimba The White Lion.",8,0,0,8 July 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank Redemption takes a prison drama and twists it into a fascinating existential treatise.
","The Shawshank Redemption is a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. The story is about a banker (Tim Robbins), wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover, who finds the strength to deal with the brutality of prison, thanks to a murderer serving a life term.The film is a tense drama of injustice and male dignity, brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's story, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their peak. A satisfying, audience-pleasing film. It has enjoyed a curious after-life. On its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption had mixed reviews and grossed just $28 million in the US; it did not make the list of Top 50 films at the box-office for that year. Yet in 2001, Channel 4 TV viewers voted it their third favourite film of all time, behind only the Star Wars and Godfather films. Readers of Time Out and Empire magazines also named it among their very favourites.",9,1,4,8 December 2009
Platoon," The Vietnam War is recreated with striking realism in Platoon.
","Platoon is clearly one of director Oliver Stone's most inspired films. Stone volunteered for the army in 1967 as a college drop-out. He wrote the screenplay for Platoon in 1975 but it took over ten years until he was able to film it. What separates Platoon from other American films dealing with the Vietnam War is that it depicts wartime massacres. Films before that, like The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979), only focused on the shattered psyches produced by the war. Keep in mind though that Platoon is a mainstream movie, so it doesn't come anywhere near the brutality that the Americans sometimes demonstrated. The 1968 My Lai Massacre, in which as many as 504 unarmed civilians were killed, is just one of many examples. The Vietnam War is considered to be the greatest trauma of 20th century American history, but a few decades later the USA savagely attacked Yugoslavia and Iraq. Platoon made a lot of money at the box office, mainly because Stone has the ability to make a film entertaining no matter what it's about. The film's partial blindness to the war was another reason for its success. It's not made clear who the American soldiers are actually fighting and why they invaded Vietnam in the first place. Let's also not forget that Stone dedicated the film to the men who lost their lives. So, when Stone is accused by some people of being anti-American or a leftie I can just laugh at their foolishness. What's most interesting about Platoon for me is that Stone brought his own experience of being a soldier in Vietnam. When Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) said that you don't really sleep even when you do get time to sleep I was immediately reminded of what my father told me. My father served in the army. Even though he didn't see combat he told me that he still stayed awake. In Platoon Stone looks at the war from his educated middle-class point of view. He shows the behavior of under-privileged blacks and of 'white trash' from middle America. Stone's direction is very good, so it's not a surprise that he won an Oscar. With cinematographer Robert Richardson he managed to capture some impressive images. He also brought intelligence to the film by depicting a war between two sergeants, Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe). It's pretty much Jesus (Elias) fighting against the covetous shadow of the American dream (Barnes). The performances by most of the cast are very good. Berenger and Dafoe are terrific. They're clearly the standouts. Historian Carroll Quigley thought that what happened to Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century was a tragedy. It's clear why. There were two big wars, a depression, and the coming of fascism. In addition to that the Russians foiled the plans of the Germans and the British and captured Eastern Europe. Yet Quigley still had hope when he wrote his famous book in the 1960s. But, as the Vietnam War dragged on, he began to lose this hope. He began to think that Western civilization is nearly finished. I think that there's still hope for Western civilization, though the Vietnam War was yet another example of the crisis that this society is going through. Platoon isn't my favorite war movie. I like Come And See (1985) and Apocalypse Now (1979) more, but I easily recommend Platoon too.",9,3,5,21 April 2014
Scream," Scream single-handedly resuscitated the teen slasher genre for the media-saturated 1990s.
","In Scream a cine-literate serial killer stalks and murders a series of teenage girls. The film revitalized the slasher film genre in the late 1990s, similar to the impact Halloween (1978) had on late 1970s film, by using a standard concept with a tongue-in-cheek approach that combined straightforward scares with dialogue that satirized slasher film conventions.Scream is a 'meta' slasher film, and one which certainly knows whereof it shrieks, functioning as a superior example of the genre it's spoofing. The in-jokes will please fans; the only downside is that it's a little too pleased with itself. Following the film's success, two sequels were released in 1997 and 2000 respectively, and a third sequel is currently in production.",9,0,2,2 September 2010
Halloween," 'The Night HE Came Home.'
","The film is one of cinema's most perfectly engineered devices for saying Boo! In a small Illinois town, the psychopathic killer Michael Myers escapes from an asylum, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends.Halloween is a simple-minded shocker with virtually no plot, just a succession of bloody, slashing attacks in semi-darkness. It's efficiently scary, and so skillfully conceived that it reinvigorated the entire horror genre in late 1970s America. Several of the film's techniques and plot elements have become a standard slasher movie trope.",10,1,5,27 June 2010
Paths of Glory," A remarkable anti-war film that retains its impact decades after its release.
","The film is beautifully performed, staged, photographed, cut and scored. In 1916 in the French trenches, three soldiers are court-martialled for cowardice by officers who want to use their case to instil discipline into the ranks.Paths Of Glory is an incisive melodrama chiefly depicting the corruption and incompetence of the high command; the plight of the soldiers is less interesting. The trench scenes are unforgettably vivid, and the rest is shot in genuine castles, with resultant difficulties of lighting and recording; the overall result is an overpowering piece of cinema.",9,2,3,23 July 2010
Raging Bull," Raging Bull explores the soul of a profoundly violent man and search for the human core buried deep inside him.
","Raging Bull is one of the bloodiest and most beautiful reflections on atonement in director Martin Scorsese's canon... it's still one of the cinema's most breathtaking films. It chronicles the rise to fame of an unlikable but virtually unstoppable middle-weight boxer (Robert De Niro), based on the autobiography of Jake La Motta, nicknamed the Bronx Bull.Filmed largely in black-and-white, this tough, compelling, powerfully made melodrama takes us uncomfortably close to the jarring action in the ring. An astonishing performance from De Niro, who inhabits the role to an eerie extent, and Scorsese orchestrates events with the aim of capturing the crunching reality of this world. It's brutal, and not a single character truly engages one's sympathy, but there's undeniably a visual poetry about it.",10,2,2,12 June 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," It has taken its place as one of the most complicated and unnerving psychological horror films.
","Naive young female FBI agent (Jodie Foster), trying to gain an insight into the mind of a serial killer, seeks the help of imprisoned serial killer and psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to track him down.These vivid characters, brilliantly acted, linger in the mind for a long time. Hopkins approaches his role as Lecter with something like gleeful gratitude; he makes it look like an actor's long-awaited dream come true. In its way, this tense thriller is a masterpiece, even if viewed from behind the sofa. In 2006 at the Key Art Awards, the original poster for the film was named best film poster 'of the past 35 years'.",10,1,1,9 July 2010
Black Panther," Black Panther leaves viewers with the feeling that they have just seen 135 minutes of pure comic-book fun, entirely well-acted and mostly well-written.
","Well, it's not surprising that Avengers: Infinity War is going to become one of the biggest box office successes in cinema history. This film has been out for less than a week and already pretty much everyone who goes to the cinema has seen it, except for me. I haven't seen it yet because I don't get the urge to do what everyone else is doing. So, I'll probably wait until I can borrow it from some library. I actually like the films that Marvel makes, but I don't jump up and down every time one of those films is released. My favorite MCU films are Thor (2011), Ant-Man (2015), Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Doctor Strange (2016), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Pretty much all the Marvel films are enjoyable, but the ones that I've listed are my favorites. The recently released Black Panther isn't one of my favorites. It's not a bad film by any means. It's good. It's more serious that the usual Marvel flick. It's just that only a few characters in the film appeal to me. The film also doesn't quite have the emotional weight that it should have. When it comes to the characters, it lacks the appeal of Thor or of Iron Man, for example. Since Marvel films contain some Anglo-American propaganda, it can also be interesting to see them because of what they're about. Some of the information in these films actually surprised me. For example, in Captain America: The First Avenger, the fictional terrorist organization Hydra uses some odd weapons and technology. Steve Rogers (Captain America) doesn't fight against regular German troops in the film but against Hydra troops armed with extraordinary weapons. Such weapons are usually the stuff of science-fiction, but I later learned that the Nazis did actually have some of those extraordinary weapons. Some of this technology and weaponry wasn't intended for mass production and some of it wasn't fully developed when Nazi Germany was defeated. So, for example, the Germans did have plans to create the Amerikabomber, which was a long-range strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the USA from Germany. In the film, the Red Skull attempts to use a similar bomber to strike the USA. At one time, Adolf Hitler considered the creation a giant tank not so different from the one that the Red Skull uses in the film. So, if the Germans hadn't been defeated in World War II, such 'miracle weapons' would have become a reality already in the 1940s or the 1950s. In the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we find out that some members of Hydra were recruited by the American espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D after World War II. Something similar happened in real life too because the Americans did bring German and other European scientists, psychiatrists, and agents to the United States after World War II. Some of these people, like Ukrainian nationalists, were so-called war criminals because they were engaged in mass killings in Europe.When it comes to what I've been reading lately, I can recommend Paul Kennedy's book 'The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers' (1987). It's a history book with some good information that was recommended by the historian Andrei Fursov. I finally finished listening to The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky a few months ago. It's a thick book, and I had to listen to it for about 25 hours. I'm now listening to the Complete Stories of Sherlock Holmes (in 3 volumes) by Arthur Conan Doyle. The narration is by Charlton Griffin, and I've got to say that I'm really enjoying listening to these releases. It's not only that the narration is very good, it's that I haven't yet read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Therefore, this is something that's new for me. Since Doyle was a Mason and a member of the British establishment, his novels contain some interesting information about British intentions in the second half of the 19th century. Another book that I'm almost finished listening to is Dispatches by Michael Herr. Dispatches was one of the first pieces of American literature that portrayed the experiences of soldiers in the Vietnam War for American readers. Herr's book is surprisingly funny at times, though he mostly describes the behavior of American soldiers and their actions. Carl Sagan's The Dragons Of Eden, which is another book that Fursov recommended, is an interesting read. I got The Dragons Of Eden right after I've read Sagan's well-known 1985 novel Contact, which is one of the more memorable hard science fiction novels that I've read. I personally prefer to read books on my tablet, by using the app Play Books. Other times, when I feel like it, I buy books at second hand book stores. But, for the most part, I read books on Play Books or I listen to them on the Audible app.Some of the novels that I've already read are Inherit The Stars (1977), which is a personal favorite, Blood Music (1985), The Visitors (1980), The Robots Of Dawn (1983), Titan (1979), Beyond The Blue Event Horizon (1977), Mission Of Gravity (1954), The Godwhale (1974), Triton (1976), In The Ocean Of Night (1977), Ender's Game (1985), and Dune (1965). When it comes to Dune by Frank Herbert, I'd recommend getting the unabridged audiobook narrated by Scott Brick and Orlagh Cassidy, among others. I'm not at all a fan of Frank Herbert's work, and his science fiction novels aren't among my favorites, but the audiobook is a compelling listen that includes music and sound effects. Although I'm still reading the manga Berserk by Kentaro Miura (I'm now reading the 16th volume), I've finished reading Battle Angel Alita by Yukito Kishiro a few months ago. I've already read famous manga like Rurouni Kenshin, Death Note, Maison Ikkoku, Akira, Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, and Fullmetal Alchemist, but Battle Angel Alita is hard to get because it has been out of print for years. Therefore, you can read it only on the internet or on an app for now. I've thought about reading it for several years, way before I knew that there was talk of adapting it into a film. Sure, the artwork is the biggest draw, but there's also a pretty good story that includes the theme of social control. Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is the continuation of the story that features more of Kishiro's fantastic artwork.",9,1,12,5 May 2018
Iron Man," An action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil.
","A billionaire weapons manufacturer (Robert Downey Jr.) builds a flying metal suit to escape the terrorists who have taken him hostage in Afghanistan. Back in America, he uses the armour to fight crime.Iron Man is an inventive, exciting vehicle for a lesser-known comic book character that gets much of its energy from its mercurial star. The first and better half deals with the hero's origins: what follows suffers from the lack of a suitable antagonist. In 2008, the film was selected by Empire Magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Tony Stark was also selected as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.",8,0,1,30 June 2010
Blade Runner," A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction.
","Blade Runner is a richly detailed and visually overwhelming trip to 2019 which sticks with you like a recurrent nightmare. In a futuristic Chinatown district of Los Angeles, an ex-cop (Harrison Ford) with carte blanche to kill is charged with tracking down and eliminating a group of androids, who escaped from a remote colony, hijacked a space shuttle and made their way to Earth.It's a film with a cult following that has gradually grown since it opened to distinctly mixed reviews and moderate box-office success. A huge influence of subsequent attempts to re-create science-fiction on film; its production design, all urban grunge and slick, acid-rainy streets, was widely copied, not least by director Ridley Scott himself. Its story is just the right combination of coherent but elusive to inspire multiple readings; the film's appeal to successive generations seems limitless.",10,2,5,21 May 2010
Casino Royale," Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role of 007.
","MI6 dispatches James Bond (Daniel Craig) to track down and destroy Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a villainous banker to terrorist organisations. The chase continues over three continents. The casting for the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy over Daniel Craig, when he was eventually selected.Casino Royale is the best Bond film since Sean Connery quit the role, with Craig a saviour of a tired franchise that creatively had long overstayed its welcome. It jettisons the infantilism and flippancy that dogged Bond films for years, and restores a welcome touch of cruelty and toughness. A ruthless, stripped-down, modern Bond, Craig rises above the role's stereotypical traps. The script is coherent while finding room for splendid stunt-driven set-pieces, notably a chase on a construction site. The opening scene, a bloody murder in a public lavatory, sets the mood; a grim torture scene confirms this is neither for kids nor for the squeamish. Here's a Bond film that Ian Fleming might have enjoyed.",8,1,7,6 July 2010
Trainspotting," It's not merely about drug addiction, but about the relationship between wasted youth and the spiritually bankrupt society that has alienated them.
","The film has been ranked 10th spot by the British Film Institute (BFI) in its list of Top 100 British films of all time. Heroin addiction seen through the experiences of four young Scottish friends whose lives are coloured by petty crime, sex, alcohol and violence - sometimes simultaneously.With its memorable opening, the iconic 'Choose life' monologue and the scene of Mark Renton haring down Edinburgh's Princess Street, being chased by cops, Trainspotting announces itself as a jolting, amoral, adrenalin-fuelled departure from the British film tradition. Its high-energy performances ooze conviction and almost casually convey the bleak reality and dangers of drugs. It's brave, fearless, sickening, relentlessly offensive - and impossible to ignore.",8,0,0,7 July 2010
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter is one of the most powerful and dramatic war films ever.
","When I decided to watch The Deer Hunter I thought that I would see a war film, but instead what I got was a drama film that lasted for about three hours. The Deer Hunter was released in 1978. It was directed by Michael Cimino. The film received high critical acclaim, won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and Cimino was even hailed as a genius. The film boasts a great cast, including Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage and Meryl Streep. They all provide stellar performances.The film's story is set during the 1960s in western Pennsylvania. It's about a group of friends from a Russian (or Rusyn, to be more precise) community. The men are steel workers. Three of them (Michael, Steven and Nick) are preparing to be sent off to Vietnam. Steven is also getting married. Michael and Nick are in love with the same woman: Linda (Meryl Streep). The beginning of the film features wedding ceremonies and a long party. Eastern Orthodox Church songs such as Slava and Russian folk songs such as Korobushka and Katyusha are played. Before setting out for the war the six friends go deer hunting. The film documents their lives before Vietnam, in Vietnam, and after Vietnam.Right from the get go I knew that I was watching a great film. Some viewers may think that it's long and boring, but if you continue watching it, it will pay off big time. Character development is significant, and it's a big part of the film. After a while I really began to care about the characters. That's how the film absorbs you, not with action or comedy but by showing the lives and actions of the characters. The scenes in Vietnam are graphic, but well shot. I heard that The Deer Hunter was the first American film about the Vietnam War. What happens in the film is totally believable. If I was told that this was a true story I wouldn't doubt it. There is also a fitting ending. After watching The Deer Hunter I felt better, somehow. It's like it raises you confidence and your understanding of life. I give The Deer Hunter my highest recommendation.",10,10,22,20 September 2009
Speed," More than just a roller coaster of a film, Speed might be one of the most action-packed movies ever made.
","Speed is like The Wages Of Fear (1953) redone at roller-coaster tempo. A psychopath with a grudge against the LAPD plants a bomb on a bus, which will explode if the speedometer drops below 50mph.Living up to its title as an adrenalised thrill-ride, the film set a benchmark for dumb fun at 1990s blockbusters, spinning enough hair-raising suspense out of its gimmicky scenario to satisfy perfectly on a popcorn level. In 1995, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing, winning the latter two. Also Sandra Bullock won 3 MTV Movie Awards for Speed.",9,0,1,6 May 2010
The Sixth Sense," A successful update of ghost stories and thrillers that forego gore and violence to create suspense.
","A Philadelphia child psychologist (Bruce Willis) struggles to save his marriage as he treats a disturbed young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who can see the dead. The film was #71 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments, for the scene where Cole encounters a female ghost in his tent.The Sixth Sense is a smashing debut from a director who failed to live up to this early promise. A fascinating, haunting film with genuine power and presence. Willis and young Osment carry off the leading roles with aplomb; the story is challenging and unpredictable. The line 'I see dead people' from the film became a popular catchphrase after its release, reaching #44 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes.",8,0,0,30 June 2010
The Producers," Filled with some of the funniest dialogue in the entire Mel Brooks' canon.
","It's one of the funniest films ever made. A Broadway producer (Zero Mostel) seduces elderly widows to obtain finance for his new play, sells 25,000 percent of the stake in the confident expectation that it will flop, and is horrified when it succeeds.The Producers is a cult success that became a public favorite through its brilliantly funny premise and a script insanely overstuffed with great gags. Mostel and Gene Wilder are an inspired example of odd-couple casting, and the appalling bad-taste musical Springtime For Hitler, with its Busby Berkeley - inspired routine showing dancers in a swastika formation, is imperishable.",10,0,2,6 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Easily the worst Star Wars film yet. A real insult to intelligence.
","I will offer my thoughts about the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer. This new trailer, by the way, again got me to think about how bad of a film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) is. I began watching videos and reading articles that criticize and pick apart this film, and I'll later post some of these videos on my blog. I've known from the beginning that it's not a good film, but I now realize that The Force Awakens is truly the worst Star Wars film so far. I really enjoyed watching and reading the negative things that people have to say about it. Here are a few reasons why it's so bad:<ul><li>It is pretty much rip-off of Star Wars (1977). In addition, it is a much worse film than Star Wars. Why should I watch an inferior version of a film that already exists? I'd rather watch the 1977 original. And, not surprisingly, I haven't seen The Force Awakens since that one time in December of 2015.</li></ul><ul><li>The new characters (Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn and others) are not interesting or appealing. They're pretty much inferior copies of old characters like Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. These new characters are just more proof that screen writers in Hollywood can no longer write believable human characters.</li></ul><ul><li>The Starkiller Base makes no sense. How could the First Order create a weapon that's several times bigger than the Death Star? Where did they get the time or the resources for this? In addition, the laws of physics don't apply to this thing. Is The Force Awakens more of a fantasy or more of a science-fiction film? The Starkiller Base is a result of poor screenplay writing.</li></ul><ul><li>So, The Force Awakens offers nothing new when it comes to plot and characters. It also offers nothing new when it comes to fashion or technology. Almost everything in The Force Awakens is something that we've seen in Star Wars films by George Lucas.</li></ul><ul><li>In short, The Force Awakens is a cash grab. It's not original. It's not art. It doesn't feel epic like the other Star Wars films. It's just a corporate product that was made to play it safe, to appeal to 'fans', and to earn as much money as possible. It's just mind-numbing.</li></ul>Well, there you have it. There are many more reasons why The Force Awakens is such a bad film. It's even worse than the Star Trek films that J. J. Abrams directed. The latest trailer does make Star Wars: The Last Jedi look somewhat promising. Rian Johnson probably made a much better film than The Force Awakens. But I won't be seeing it in a theater because The Force Awakens left such a bad taste. I'll be boycotting The Last Jedi just like I boycotted Rogue One (2016).What can I say? Thanks to The Force Awakens, the prequel trilogy that George Lucas directed doesn't seem so bad now. At least the prequels have some originality. Even that romance that was played out by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman doesn't seem so bad now. By the way, I once read that Portman strives to keep a good image as an actress by not appearing in trashy movies. That's admirable, I thought, especially when compared to other Hollywood actresses. But, as it turns out, according to a gossip website, even she appeared in at least one movie without every item of clothing on her. I haven't seen Hotel Chevalier (2007), which is what that amusing cartoon that I posted earlier about, but I have seen The Darjeeling Limited (2007). I've seen it so long ago that I can't remember what happened in it, but I did include it on my list of the ten best movies of 2007.So, The Force Awakens is truly awful. But I'll mention that there's another film that's even more painful to watch. It's Casual Sex? from 1988. I'll admit that I like watching Hollywood films from the 1980s. Even the bad films from that decade don't seem so bad when compared to many modern films. So, what can go wrong? But Casual Sex? is so dull that it took me about a month to finish watching it. Sometimes, I watched it several seconds at a time. It felt like a chore. It's very dull. It stars Lea Thompson and Victoria Jackson, but there's nothing original about this film, and nothing interesting happens in it. If you'd like to get tortured, watch this film.",1,20,90,14 October 2017
RED," A playful action blockbuster with a top-shelf cast.
","I didn't watch Red until after I watched Red 2 (2013) in a theater. It didn't seem interesting to me at first. I watched Red 2 in an auditorium full of adults and was pleasantly surprised. I only watched it to waste some time but Red 2 turned out to be a very funny and enjoyable film. I watched it in the evening and it made my day. So, naturally, the next day I watched Red. I consider it to be just as enjoyable as its sequel. It may be funnier too. Bruce Willis is 59 now but he still manages to shine in the action roles that he picks. He isn't picking anything meaningful, but Live Free Or Die Hard (2007) was one fine action film. The comedy that he shares with Mary-Louise Parker in Red boosts the action at the beginning. However, the film becomes even more enjoyable once John Malkovich jumps out of the bushes. His antics as the wild-eyed paranoid assassin Marvin Boggs just have to be seen. Morgan Freeman, who seems to be in many films these days, plays the canny and loose Joe Matheson. He does well with the clever comedy too. All the main players seem to be having a blast with the weaponry. Helen Mirren more so than others perhaps. She looks elegant in the expensive clothes, even when she's firing a machine gun. The cast is definitely the best feature about Red. Karl Urban acts just as well as the main players, with confidence and style. With Red director Robert Schwentke managed to make what is easily his best film to date. The energetic action scenes that he filmed with cinematographer Florian Ballhaus are stylish and coherent. The downside to Schwentke's direction is the film's awkward pacing, which makes it seem longer than it actually is. This prevents Red from being a truly satisfying action comedy. Still, it's not a big problem. The film looks great, the laughs come often, and the action is exciting. The biggest draw though is certainly the cast of famous actors. This unconventional yet exciting concept gets a high recommendation from me.",7,1,1,18 June 2014
Rear Window," Wryly entertaining as well as skillfully executed and thematically complex.
","A photo-journalist (James Stewart), confined to his room by a broken leg, is convinced he has seen a murder committed in a room on the other side of the court.Rear Window is an artificial but gripping suspense thriller, which has plenty to say about voyeurism and the reality of what is observed from a distance. Delightfully, each window opposite provides a glimpse of a miniature drama that resolves itself (or not) during the film's course. Intriguingly, Alfred Hitchcock added a sexually knowing romance between Stewart and Grace Kelly to this intriguing premise. It all adds up to one of the director's most brilliant films. It received four Academy Award nominations, was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1997.",10,1,3,8 July 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," In many ways grander in scale than the first two installments of the trilogy.
","The hobbits approach the slopes of Mount Doom, preparing to dispose of the cursed Ring, while the forces of good and evil are rallied in anticipation of the ultimate battle. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the only time in history a fantasy film has done so.The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films, which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands, and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other, like jet planes waiting to land, the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that, for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subject; thrilling spectacle is underscored with palpable human drama, and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R. Tolkien's books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many.",10,9,12,5 July 2010
The Truman Show," A commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation.
","A baby boy is adopted by a television company and made the subject of a 24-hour soap opera. He grows up and discovers his wife, friends and neighbours are all acting their parts in his life.The Truman Show is a dazzling, smart satire on the media, which now seems less implausible, and even prophetic in the era of reality TV. The creation of Seahaven, the idyllic town that is really a studio set, is a breathtaking coup; and the character of Truman Burbank finally does justice to Jim Carrey's scattershot talents. The film was a financial and critical success, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards and The Saturn Awards.",8,0,2,4 July 2010
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A tightly paced science-fiction adventure that's a success in every way.
","I was curious when I found out that a different director was going to be hired to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games (2012). I liked what Gary Ross did with the first film though there was certainly a shortage of thrills. When Francis Lawrence was hired to direct Catching Fire in May of 2012 I became skeptical. He directed three films before and they had some problems. Constantine (2005) is stylish and entertaining but slightly misses the mark. I Am Legend (2007) is mildly invigorating but unmemorable. Water For Elephants (2011) is an interesting but formulaic romantic drama. But Lawrence clearly got better because Catching Fire is a sophisticated film that's filled with thrills. Lawrence got to work with a budget of $140 million, which is almost twice the budget of The Hunger Games. It shows because improvements in sets and special-effects are noticeable from the beginning. The districts are shown with detail. The Quarter Quell arena looks fantastic. The procession of the chariots makes you feel as though you're in the Capitol, the futuristic Rome. It's clear that the filmmakers put as much effort in the political intrigue of the story as in the action. The performances from Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman are very good. Sutherland brings a sense of menace to Coriolanus Snow that wasn't really there in the first film. It's like in the great 1985 war drama Come And See because the acting is so good that watching characters interact is a treat. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a more confident performance this time. Her promotional tour for the film was certainly eventful. She talked about her hair, weight issues, kissing, on-set injuries and so on. The videos sure were funny. Josh Hutcherson got better too. Now he's not the bland Peeta Mellark of the first film. He has more to do, and he's becoming a real companion for Katniss Everdeen. It's interesting that Jena Malone got the part of Johanna Mason. She's been in several good films but she hasn't had this level of fame before. Malone definitely makes an impression in the arena. The pair of Malone and Sam Claflin lights up the grim situation of the Quarter Quell. Claflin clearly studied how to use a trident, and he gained weight for the role. He does a good job as Finnick Odair, and he sure does look different from his role in Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). James Newton Howard's music score for Catching Fire offers a good mix of stoic melodies and bold action cues. The entertaining soundtrack features some of pop and rock's biggest names. The singles included are Atlas by Coldplay, Elastic Heart by Sia Furler, and We Remain by Christina Aguilera. But my favorite tracks are Mirror by Ellie Goulding and Shooting Arrows At The Sky by Santigold. With Catching Fire Francis Lawrence managed to appease both the fan base and the viewers unfamiliar with the story. It's a step up from the first film in every way. The costumes are better too, though I didn't like the new Peacekeeper uniforms. In a world after Harry Potter Catching Fire stands out from other schmaltzy young adult films. It's an intelligent blockbuster that's also brutal. That's a real success if you consider its PG-13 rating. I recommend it.",8,1,16,17 January 2014
The Matrix," An exhilarating sci-fi treatise on the nature of reality.
","A computer hacker (Keanu Reeves) is recruited to help expose an alternative reality designed by invading machines to enslave humanity. The film contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures.The Matrix was a hugely successful and influential science-fiction blockbuster - a nerd's wet dream, essentially, though less profound and original than it thinks, particularly in its representation of a dystopian futurescape. It deserves credit for at least attempting to blend state-of-the-art thrills, each set-piece insistent on topping the one before, with a more existential line of inquiry (or a line of inquiry as existential as a Joel Silver film will allow).",10,1,5,1 July 2010
Casino," Scorsese unstintingly reveals the viciousness of the old school Vegas powerbrokers.
","Casino constantly dazzles with visual, auditory and thematic stimuli. A gambler (Robert De Niro) assumes managership of a Mob-run Las Vegas casino, only for dealings with his former call-girl wife (Sharon Stone) and a petulant bodyguard to expose him to his enemies.It's a film both of excess in both content and form, bloated at almost three hours. One could argue that voice over and soundtrack to bridge the gaps between set-pieces, but those set-pieces are masterful. Joe Pesci's performance - a hyperactive retread of his Goodfellas (1990) schtick - is a weak spot, but De Niro and Stone (the real revelation here) are very good indeed. It's arguably director Martin Scorsese's most underrated film.",7,1,3,29 August 2010
Heat," De Niro's and Pacino's combined star power was one of Heat's major selling points.
","The film is a stunning crime drama that shares its protagonists' rabid attention to detail - and love of adrenalin. A Los Angeles police lieutenant (Al Pacino) pursues the mastermind (Robert De Niro) of a highly organized robbery outfit, and likes his style.Heat is virtuosically crafted but overstretched modern noir, in which director Michael Mann's idea that the cop and criminal are similar souls arbitrarily divided by law comes to seem facile, and the much-hyped face-off between De Niro and Pacino strikes disappointingly few sparks. Still, as an epic panorama of urban existence it is often breathtaking.",8,0,2,1 July 2010
300," The whole thing runs the chance of simply being a song-and-dance number made up of quick-to-slow shots of steel, blood, and open-throated yelling.
","Snyder's 300 is a bucket of filth that somehow manages to get praised by brainless Americans and by some bought and paid for professional film critics. Sure, 300 isn't the only bucket of filth that has been made in Hollywood in the last two decades. There have been many such buckets of filth. But I think that 300 is the film that is most representative of all of this filth. 300 is much louder, much more distasteful, and much more historically inaccurate than The 300 Spartans (1962), which is actually a fine film that's worth seeing. In addition, I noticed that it promotes militarism and oligarchical rule. Sparta, the Greek city-state whose citizens and customs are portrayed as being worthy of imitation in the film, had oligarchical and militaristic rule. But Classical Athens, the Greek city-state whose citizens are portrayed as weak and ineffective in the film, had democratic rule. In fact, Athens is the birthplace of democracy and the model of democracy. It also became the most prosperous Greek city-state after the Greco-Persian Wars. Now, if you want to know what a real democracy should be like, you should read some history books about Classical Athens or at least look at the Wikipedia page about Fifth-century Athens. It's quite different from the so-called democracy that exists in the USA. In addition, I recommend reading Carroll Quigley's books 'The Evolution of Civilizations: An Introduction to Historical Analysis' (1961) and 'Weapons Systems and Political Stability: A History' (1983), which provide even more useful information and conclusions about Ancient Greece. I think that this is important because most people these days don't know what democracy is supposed to be like, partly because of the fact that they get a bad education in school. This is why some middle class people fall for oligarchical swindles like libertarianism and why other middle class people think that democracy is a failure and thus become irrational pro-fascists. The overwhelming majority of Americans, for example, don't care about democracy. They don't even know what it is. What they do care about is the empire that the USA possesses. Therefore, when you criticize the American political system, they respond in a calm and apathetic manner. But, when you criticize the American empire and overseas operations, they respond in a heated and confrontational manner (even in a psychotic manner). The same goes for class structure in the USA. This is the case because they've been taught to think like this by the American ruling class. They've been taught to think that they have a right to trample on others and to stick their noses in every crack. But, when it comes to democracy and their economic rights under capitalism, they take a conservative and unconcerned position. This isn't true for all Americans, but it's undoubtedly true for most Americans.",6,0,4,17 September 2019
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Red Line is a beautifully rendered treatise on man and nature.
","US soldiers in C-for-Charlie army rifle company discover disturbing truths about each other in the tropics as they desperately fight the Japanese on Guadalcanal in 1943.A philosophical, beautiful film about war, constantly surveying the ravishing landscape and the place of natural life within it, and contrasting it with the brutish horrors of battle. At times, it's almost a dreamy meditation. Visually, it is quite unforgettable. The Thin Red Line is a unique masterpiece. While not successful at the North American box office, the film was a moderate commercial success worldwide, grossing $98 million against its $52 million budget.",9,0,3,22 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," It's very unlikely that there will ever be a Star Wars film as good as this one.
","I recently watched the original Star Wars trilogy (1977-1983) in order to see how good these films really are. I already pointed out that I won't be seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi in a theater because Star Wars: The Force Awakens really disappointed me. The Force Awakens is perhaps the most shallow, uninspired piece of filmmaking that I've ever seen in my life. Actually, recently, I got a lot of enjoyment out of reading user reviews of The Force Awakens on IMDb. Almost all the popular reviews on IMDb gave this film a rating of one out of a possible ten stars. On the other hand, almost all paid film critics praised The Force Awakens when it was released. As some people pointed out, this shows that film critics working for popular newspapers and websites can't be trusted. They praised The Force Awakens because they were paid by Walt Disney Studios or because they were pressured. There is a word in the English language that describes this situation. It's corruption. What's interesting is that Disney has been pressuring movie theaters into showing The Last Jedi in all the largest auditoriums when the film will be released. In other words, it seems that Disney wants to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible with the release of The Last Jedi. Make of this what you will. Possibly, The Last Jedi is a disappointing film, just like The Force Awakens. Therefore, Disney wants to make as much money as possible before negative reviews by honest film critics begin appearing on the internet. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will be showered with overwhelming praise by paid film critics upon release, just like the awful The Force Awakens was. I'm not saying that The Last Jedi will be just as bad as The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson probably managed to make a better film than The Force Awakens. But it's possible, maybe probable, that The Last Jedi will also turn out to be a disappointment and a cash grab.Anyway, let's get back to the original trilogy. I've got to say that I was rather impressed by these three films, especially by The Empire Strikes Back. The visuals impressed me the most. I don't really think of Star Wars as science fiction. This is why I didn't include Star Wars films on my list of the best science fiction films. For me, these films are more like space fantasy or science fantasy. But the visuals of space and spaceships in these films are some of the best ever put to film. George Lucas created quite an imaginative world in Star Wars. There is no doubt that Lucas is a visionary. But, of course, Lucas grew up at a time when Americans were brought up to be inventive, capable, and original. For the last several decades, however, Americans have been brought up not to be inventive and knowledgeable but to be uninventive and obedient. Such is the policy of the capitalist American ruling class. Therefore, Americans don't really invent anything anymore and they can't come up with original ideas. I've seen the original Star Wars trilogy four times, I think. Now that I'm no longer a teenager, I realize that these three films are quite impressive pieces of filmmaking. The special effects are particularly impressive. But Lucas and company were also smart enough to bring in experienced British actors in order to make certain scenes more meaningful. As it turns out, many of the novels in the Star Wars Expanded Universe are worth reading too. I'm now reading Heir To The Empire, Deceived, and Darth Plagueis. What I should mention is that I'm not hating the new Star Wars films because I'm just a hater. I'm not obsessed with Star Wars, and I've never been a fan, but I still wanted these films to be good. Unfortunately, they're not good. They contain propaganda, just like the original trilogy did, but they are unoriginal corporate cash grabs. On the other hand, The Empire Strikes Back is such a good film that I got an urge to watch it again after it was over.",10,0,1,5 November 2017
Aladdin," A rollicking, bodaciously choreographed fantasy.
","The film is floridly beautiful, shamelessly derivative and infused with an irreverent, sophisticated comic flair. A street urchin (Scott Weinger) discovers a magic lamp which allows him to win the favour of a princess (Linda Larkin).Aladdin is a splendidly spry and enjoyable romp, a return to near-peak form for Disney which lets loose Robin Williams's improvisatory flair in the role of the Genie, while showing off some great animation. But it's a shame about the songs. The film was followed by two sequels released direct to video: The Return Of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin And The King Of Thieves (1996).",8,2,3,26 April 2012
Sin City," A mad brushstroke of digital film-making that is risqué enough to be considered bold.
","Sin City is a film noir based on Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name. The story is about three tough guys in depraved Basin City who try to save the women they love.The film is one of the truest transfers of comic-book to film, a ferociously stylised piece which successfully creates its own pulp universe. Still, it's a singularly repellent one, in which the women are prostitutes across the board, and the violence is unredeemed by any underlying humanity. Sin City gathered particular recognition for its unique coloring procession, which rendered most of the film in black and white but retained or added coloring for select objects.",8,2,3,4 July 2010
Braveheart," Gibson, long-time heartthrob of the silver screen, came into his own as a director with Braveheart.
","The film is at its best an exhilarating Highland fling. Scottish rebel William Wallace (Mel Gibson) rallies an army of various clans against English king Edward I (Patrick McGoohan).Braveheart is a historically questionable account of Wallace's life and death with a hackneyed script. But it undoubtedly makes for stirring widescreen cinema, heading off Hollywood glamour with a mixture of mud, blood and guts. The film won five Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director, and had been nominated for an additional five. The film's depiction of the Battle of Stirling Bridge is often considered one of the greatest movie battles in cinema history.",8,1,9,9 July 2010
Gladiator," A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back.
","A second-century Roman general (Russell Crowe) is condemned to death by the Emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) but escapes to become a slave and a gladiator before wreaking a spectacular revenge and restoring the moral compass of the Roman Empire.Gladiator is an expensive, elaborate, action film that became the first bona fide sword-and-sandals epic in four decades. The pace never falters thanks to director Ridley Scott's attentive direction, buttressed by an astronomical budget. Crowe, alternating between hand-to-hand combat and grave contemplation, is hugely credible in the title role. A massive hit for wholly understandable reasons. The film was nominated for and won multiple awards; it won five Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards including Best Picture.",7,1,3,27 June 2010
Donnie Darko," One of the eeriest and most ambitious American independent films of the early 2000s.
","In the late 1980s, a disturbed, introverted teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) is visited by a giant rabbit who convinces him the world is about to end and commands him to destroy property while sleepwalking.Donnie Darko is a dark, provocative and often muddled comedy, constantly brightened by sudden shafts of originality and humour. The film became a word-of-mouth cult hit and made Gyllenhaal a star, while writer-director Richard Kelly also became a hot name for a while. It has received favorable reviews from critics and developed a large cult following, resulting in the director's cut receiving a two-disc, special edition release in 2004.",8,1,4,21 July 2010
Born on the Fourth of July," Born On The Fourth Of July is a historical drama that truly merits the word 'important.'
","Few films of the 1980s have covered so much ground with such aplomb, fewer still have packed such a punch to the heart. Born On The Fourth Of July is a biopic of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), an all-American boy who returned from Vietnam in a wheelchair and became a pivotal figure in the anti-war movement.Not for the first time, director Oliver Stone risks alienating audiences with his methadology, although here his faith in his own wilder instincts looks more like bold, gutsy film-making. He draws a commanding central performance from his young lead, who stretches himself as far as Kovic's plight will allow.",8,0,1,27 June 2010
Back to the Future," Back To The Future accelerates with wit, ideas, and infectious, wide-eyed wonder.
","I wasn't excited to review Back To The Future because it has become a very popular film, but, after watching it again, I took out my pen and some recycled paper to get it over with. Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it.",9,1,1,27 April 2010
Goodfellas," Director Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy.
","Godfellas is an incredible, relentless experience about the single-minded pursuit of crime. A Brooklyn boy (Ray Liotta) works his way up the mafia hierarchy, until every thing goes sour.The film is a scorching saga of criminality run amok, dictating every handshake and tainting every relationship. Cinematically it is lethal and seductive, drawing us into the evily glamorous embrace of the mob lifestyle – but, like Faust, these characters have hell to pay. More than a decade later, no less than 22 members of the cast would be featured in the acclaimed mob-themed TV series The Sopranos. The word 'f**k' is used in the film approximately 300 times, ninth most in film.",10,1,2,5 February 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Thanks to the top-notch cast, The Bourne Supremacy is a functional thriller.
","A former CIA hit-man (Matt Damon) fights to prove his innocence after being framed for the murder of two informants.The spy franchise propelled itself into the 21st century with this second installment, which - despite Damon's necessarily blank performance - benefits from the immediacy of director Paul Greengrass's camera, several truly exhilarating set-pieces and the contrived employment of blue-chip acting talent. The film ranks 454th on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. It received a positive critical and public reaction, and was followed by a 2007 sequel entitled The Bourne Ultimatum.",7,0,3,29 August 2010
The Great Gatsby," An absorbing, delightful, tragic and reverent adaptation of a seemingly unfilmable story.
","Watching The Great Gatsby was a pleasant surprise for me. It's the best film I've seen so far this year, and it's easily the best adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's celebrated novel. The first two things that stand out in the film are the masterful art direction and set design. There are gorgeous costumes galore but even the backgrounds are detailed and beautifully shot. Director Baz Luhrmann mentioned that he wanted the period to look fresh even by today's standards. The 1920s was certainly a booming period, but in the film it's so lush and vibrant that it's as though we're looking at another world. This is a good thing though. It's one of the film's strengths. Western Civilization was still expanding at that time. I recommend that people read historian Carroll Quigley's great books. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an excellent performance as the mysterious, charismatic and handsome Jay Gatsby. Though Gatsby is a tragic character DiCaprio exudes his pure enduring hope perfectly. In this film DiCaprio just is Gatsby. But in addition to DiCaprio's central performance we have commitment from every other actor too. Joel Edgerton is particularly effective as Daisy's brute husband Tom Buchanan. Carey Mulligan, who burst into tears when she got the part, was an interesting though good choice for the role of Daisy Buchanan. In yet another good role Tobey Maguire is perfect at playing Nick Carraway. But there's also the captivating performance from Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker. The soundtrack features the talents of Jay-Z, Beyonce, Lana del Rey, Florence + the Machine, Bryan Ferry, Jack White and Gotye. The choice of these performers may seem odd but their music works well in the context of the film. Some of the biggest names in today's music industry were contributors, but I would even say that the choice of music was sometimes inspired. The film is simply beautiful as well as entertaining. Luhrmann and Catherine Martin have to be praised. What I liked most about it, however, was it's chain of impressive scenes. In my opinion the film's pacing is similar to Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985). That is, almost every scene is an infectious episode that can be seen again and again. This again shows that Luhrmann is a great director. No doubt about it, The Great Gatsby is must-see cinema. Even if you didn't like Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Australia (2008) you should see this film. I highly recommend it.",9,3,11,7 June 2013
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Covenant is a notch better than the expertly crafted but underwhelming Prometheus.
","Is Alien: Covenant (2017) really that bad? I did say that it's a disappointing film. What I meant by this is that it's just disappointing and not terrible. In my view, Covenant is a slightly better film than Prometheus (2012) because it makes a little more sense. A few people said to me that they kind of like Covenant. I can understand why they think that. Covenant is entertaining, and it does make more sense than Prometheus, but it also has some of the same problems. Because Covenant is a film by director Ridley Scott, it's a given that it looks very good. And, honestly, I'd like for him to make a sequel to Covenant. I'm a little interested in what he might be able to do with a sequel.The biggest disappointment of this year at the cinema for me was the film It, which was directed by Andy Muschietti. It didn't even seem like a film to me. More like a collection of nonsense. I can't believe that so many people are praising this film. Sure, it's kind of entertaining, the acting is fine, and there's some humor, but this is where the good stuff ends. And, unfortunately, I fell for the hype. I had a good feeling that I'd be somewhat disappointed by this film because it's hard to adapt Stephen King's thick novel to film, but I didn't think that it would be such a mess. Now I understand why Cary Fukunaga dropped out during the production phase. It seems that he intended to make a good film that respected the material in the novel. The film that we got in the end has few similarities with the novel. What made my viewing experience worse is the fact that I finished reading the novel just several days earlier. It was still fresh in my mind, and I remembered pretty much everything that happened in the novel. When I was watching the film, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was plenty of swearing that isn't in the novel. There's no explanation of who Pennywise is. The film is set in 1989, but the filmmakers still decided to make the characters do what they did in 1958. This doesn't work at all. I can't imagine children, and even grownups, behaving like this in the 1980s! I still can't believe that I wasted my money and time on this turd. Avoid it!So, I finally finished listening to the audiobook of Stephen King's It. It took quite some time because it's about 45 hours long. I didn't get as much enjoyment out of the novel as I did when I read it years ago. I still enjoyed listening to most of it, especially the first half, in which King explains the history of Derry. It's when the reader doesn't yet know what It is. The novel is by no means a masterpiece, and I don't like a few aspects of King's writing, but It still seems pretty good to me after all these years. Now that I'm done with It, I'm listening to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, which is a novel that I've wanted to read for quite some time. Instead of reading The Idiot, I decided to listen to the audiobook since I had a few credits to spend. What's also worth noting is that I've noticed a rather interesting trend in American fiction of the 1980s. I'm now reading a few American science-fiction novels from the 1980s, and something that pops up even in the genre of science-fiction of this period is anti-Soviet propaganda. I'm sure that many people know about the writer Tom Clancy, about the fact that his novels are pretty much anti-Soviet, pro-American military propaganda. Well, all of this isn't a coincidence. The fact that Ronald Reagan praised Clancy's propaganda novel The Hunt for Red October (1984) wasn't a coincidence too. As historian Andrei Fursov explained, the Americans, when Reagan was president, intentionally raised tensions with the Soviet Union. The Americans released a lot of offensive anti-Soviet propaganda in the 1980s. The fact that Hollywood released many action films in the 1980s also wasn't a coincidence. The Americans were intentionally trying to create an atmosphere of tension, violence, and confrontation. They did this because they had a strategy of trying to weaken the Soviet Union and possibly cause it to collapse. It's because they saw this as one of two ways of getting out of the economic crisis that was affecting the West since the early-1970s. The other way for them was war. In the end, we all know that the Americans succeeded, thanks to people like Mikhail Gorbachev. The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed the capitalist ruling class of the West to postpone a serious economic crisis until 2008.",6,0,4,9 September 2017
All the President's Men," A dynamic detective yarn, even though everyone already knows the ending.
","The film is a reconstruction of the discovery of the White House link with the Watergate affair by two young reporters (Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman) from the Washington Post, whose dogged investigations hastened the resignation of President Richard Nixon.All The President's Men is an absorbing drama, which despite its many excellences would have been better with a more audible dialogue track, less murky photography and a cleaner introduction of the characters concerned. The acting, however, is a treat. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as one of the 25 'Powerful Political Thrillers'. According to Box Office Mojo.com, the film earned a 'Domestic Total Gross' of $70,600,000.",10,3,3,8 July 2010
Atonement," A mischievous girl accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.
","The film is ambitious, terrifically acted, moving and for the most part transcends its status as a historical drama. On a hot summer's day in the 1930s in the grounds of an English manor house, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a budding author aged 13, tells a damaging lie about Robbie (James McAvoy), the lover of her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). The lie changes all their lives, with consequences that extend beyond World War II.This remarkably lavish, visually ravishing film does full justice to Ian McEwan's brilliant, detailed source novel. Director Joe Wright skilfully evokes the atmosphere of languid lust in the first act, and surpasses himself with a nightmarish evocation of the chaos and misery on the beach at Dunkirk, brought to life in a single five-minute tracking shot. A short triumphant coda with Vanessa Redgrave as an older, successful Briony, voicing her regrets, confirms Atonement as a rarity: a sumptuous spectacle with vast reserves of intelligence. Dario Marianelli's lush, romantic score includes a theme featuring the tapping of typewriter keys, a reminder that this is a story about storytelling.",8,0,2,4 July 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A picaresque comedy set in the Deep South during the Depression.
","Three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson), two of them dimwits, the other dapper vain and smooth-talking, escape from a chain gang in 1930s Mississippi, go searching for buried treasure, and experience wildly varied adventures.Extremely loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, this very funny road film (with brilliant music thrown in) ticks off more cultural references than you can shake a stick at, yet still carves out its own shambling, goofy identity. T-Bone Burnett supplied an impeccable collection of traditional country and bluegrass songs for the soundtrack. O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film which otherwise had very few visual effects.",8,0,1,5 July 2010
The Godfather," Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema.
","The film is one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. When, after ruling for two generations, the Mafia's New York Don (Marlon Brando) dies, his youngest son (Al Pacino) takes over reluctantly, but later learns the ruthlessness and brutality required to maintain his position.The Godfather is a brilliantly-made film with all the fascination of a snake pit: a warm-hearted family saga except that the members are thieves and murderers. Its position as one of the great films of the last century is secure, in part because it works on so many levels: as a father-and-son story, as an epic account of the Mob's overt power and clandestine business empires in America; and as an apparently authentic glimpse into a closed world, with its own distinct and deadly codes of behaviour.",10,2,5,30 June 2010
