Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Tipic Del Toro Movie with many special effects and great sense of humor by Ron Perlman! *** out ****
","I am not a fan of DeL Toro movies, i hate Del Toro Movies including the first Hellboy, but this second Hellboy was a quite entertaining movie with a good performance of Ron Perlman that is the only reason to see this movie if you want to get fun with Hellboy played by Perlman, i recommend you see this, in general the movie is good, with a very fantasies visual effects.I didn't liked Selma Blair performance because is the typical girl in a super hero movie and is not original.Other reason to see this movie is Luke Goss playing Hellboy Villain with good ambitions for playing an evil villain and i see in the movie that Goss get many fun playing this evil villain. I really liked the battle sequences with fantasies monsters and when the big green monster appears in the city fighting with Hellboy is amazing and unbelievable.If you want to see a Hellboy with a great sense of humor, an entertaining soundtrack, an evil villain and if you like Del Toro Movies you will like this. An if you like little appearances of great actors like John Hurt you wanna like the movie.",8,3,33,8 July 2008
Batman Begins," Finally an entertaining and very good Batman movie! ***1/2 out of ****
","I saw the other 4 batman movies and only the first and the second are quite good, the other 2 are really terrible because is not entertaining there, but this is one of my favorite superhero movies, great story, great actors, good action sequences,some intense thriller scenes, here all the requisites of a good superhero movie.I really liked the performance of Christian Bale because he is cold and Batman is cold, and he had the little sense of humor that Batman need to have a just man building a big lie and convince people to begin in the lie and believe in a good future of Gothic city fighting in this movie with Ras'Ghul played by Liam Neeson that did a quite job playing this character with little conviction I really liked the performance of Gary Oldman playing Jim Gordon, making of him the character of Batman Comics joining forces with Batman, he really played Gordon with excellent conviction and very seriously acting and in the second movie he really did for my opinion a very good performance.And this Batman become more interesting when appear actors like Michael Cane, Morgan Freeman,Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman; they bring to the movie humor and humanity.With an excellent original score, with good visual effects, with good costume design, good acting and a great direction of Christopher Nolan, i recommend you to see this Batman Movie, this is really good and stunning.",9,2,2,24 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Simple the best superhero movie!!!! **** out of ****
","I really hope a good movie, but never a peace of art, a really excellent movie with excellent interpretations, good photography, very good story, a combination of action with crime, drama, thriller and film-noir. Christopher Nolan is really an excellent director, and he prove it once more after making very good movies as Batman Begins and The Prestige. What can i said about Ledger? i really can said that is amazing playing The Joker, totally different to the Burton joker, this more terrific an anarchist and a physic. I think this movie will receive many nominations for Oscar, is really a classic. And another excellent point of this movie, Gary Oldman playing Gordon, i really enjoyed the interpretation, he maintains you with many entertainment in the movie, he did a good job with Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane, bringing the picture dramatic sense and many humanity. Bale was good, he was born for the interpretation; Eckhart was regular after he was the Two-Face, he lose all the equilibrium. I really recommend you to see this, very exciting, excellent soundtrack by Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, very good editing and excellent sound. Very Good action scenes, Intense Thriller sequences and very realistic story are the requisites to see this Spectacular Drama.",10,6,13,28 July 2008
Iron Man," Robert Downey Jr give Iron Man great fun and entertainment! *** 1/2 out of ****
","Robert Downey Jr back to the cinemas on a great way, with a great performance getting fun playing Iron Man, in a very entertaining movie with comedy, action and adventure, perfect for a popcorn flick, but this popcorn flick have very sense of humor because Jon Favreau did very good job and did his best movie directed.There are few action scenes in the movie but are amazing with good special effects good battle between Iron Man and Obadiah Stone played with a great conviction by 4 academy award nominee Jeff Bridges that entertain very much with his performance playing an acceptable villain.Other important factor in this movie was the locations, are very exceptional and the soundtrack is very good. The participation of Patrow and Howard in this movie is very interesting because give the movie more intensity and emotions!!!! Jon Favreau no only did his best movie, did one of the best and entertaining movies of 2008, i think this movie could be nominated for one Oscar, i think.If you want to see entertaining superhero movie with great acting an a good, Good special effects and exciting story, i recommend you see Iron Man.",9,1,2,8 July 2008
