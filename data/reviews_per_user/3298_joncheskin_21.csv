The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Psychological Hunger Games
","The latest installment of the Hunger Games, Mockingjay, Part 1, is a movie that has caused a lot of controversy among its fans. Mockingjay, Part 1 picks up where Catching Fire left off, with the resistance having rescued Katniss but left Peeta to a potentially disturbing fate in the capitol. Katniss herself seems a bit disturbed--like it or not, her courage, compassion and honesty have left her as the face of the resistance--a role that she is clearly uncomfortable with. The movie is mostly a character study of her, as she balances her love for Peeta against her role as the Mockingjay, while also fighting the fact that she is still a very young woman. I will first say, however, that I understand why people are upset about this movie. The spectacular action and cliff-hanging thrills of the first two movies are mostly gone. Those looking for the slick and admittedly thrilling tension of the teenage violence of the first two movies will miss it very much here.That said, this movie is really interesting on its own merits, as it tries to do something both engaging and different. Mockingjay creates a sense of tension quite engaging for moviegoers who like character studies. Katniss has to decide, for example, does she really want to be the Mockingjay--ie, symbol of the resistance? The resistance is portrayed cleverly in the movie, as the good-guy, except that they too engage in a highly specious propaganda and behavior that seems more sketchy than meets the eye. At the same time, Peeta is in the hands of the government, but he appears to have turned traitor to the resistance as the government uses him as a propaganda tool. Or has he turned traitor? The film is admirably not clear. What is clear, however, is that Katniss's actions, as the lightning rod of the resistance, could get him killed, so she has that weighing on her as well.Additionally, the film's treatment of the notion of propaganda itself is ingenious--who would ever have conceived of a teenage movie on this topic? And yet, Mockingjay makes us understand how images can or cannot be manufactured for the purposes of swaying and deceiving a crowd. Much of the movie consists of the conflict of the resistance trying to produce effective propaganda--in other words, lies--from a character as relentlessly honest and principled as Katniss. This is again really interesting.I realize that this movie is not for everyone, but I personally thought it might be the best of the three. Jennifer Lawrence plays it brilliantly, as a teenage girl constantly on the verge of coming unhinged (which is exactly what the movie is about), on the one hand overwhelmed by the awesome responsibilities that seemed to be thrust upon her, on the other hand a young woman in love trying to save her endangered beloved. Only Lawrence could do it, as she seems to possess some special quality of emotion or spirit that only 1 in 10000 people have. She walks through the movie actually torn apart by its conflicts (or at least she seems to!) and that in itself is really impressive.",8,2,9,1 June 2015
50 First Dates," Clever Existential Romantic Comedy
","What would happen if you met a soul-mate by accident in a café, hit it off really well, made a date for the next day, and then, when you met her, you notice that she does not remember you at all? This happens to Henry (Adam Sandler), who is completely confused until the café owner pulls him aside and lets him know that Lucy (Drew Barrymore), the girl in question, has brain damage from an auto accident which causes her short term memory to be erased every time she goes to sleep for the night. Henry is discouraged to realize that, if he wants to get to know Lucy, he has to hook up with her fresh every day, and on a bet with one of the cooks in the café, he does this until he realizes something extraordinary is happening--he is falling in love.Enter a premise for a romantic comedy that seems a little weak on the surface, but actually turns out to have a lot behind it. The idea is clearly inspired by the now classic Groundhog Day, with its notion of an endless existential loop, and actually asks the question of whether a person can somehow manage to develop a coherent existence if they have to start fresh every day. Henry and Lucy recreate their relationship every day, and the question is whether it can possibly last.The film is fun--not only because of the performances of the leads, but also a set of supporting characters who clearly are up for the situation. Sandler gives a really good performance--the irony of his character is that before the relationship, he has a phobia about commitment, and once he has met a woman for whom this is not an issue, he actually wishes more and more that he can have a long-term relationship. The relationship actually goes through the normal phases--getting more and more serious as time goes on, with Sandler with the aid of Lucy's family finding more and more ingenious ways to reacquaint Lucy very quickly with the specifics of her life each day. Can it work? Obviously you need to see the movie to find out.",7,2,3,30 April 2016
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Straitforward Classic
","101 Dalmatians is a straightforward animated classic whose brilliance is in its details. The plot is an uncomplicated kids story--a young couple own two dogs that have dalmatian puppies, but an evil friend of the couple wants the puppies for an unclear purpose. It turns out that she wants to kill them and use their coats for a fashion experiment, and after the couple decides not to sell her the puppies, she sends a couple of hired goons to kidnap them. The goons do their job, but the puppies escape and the chase is on.101 Dalmatians sounds like a kids' movie, and it is a kids' movie, but like all good Disney movies, this film resonates with adults as well. The key aspect is the villain, Cruella de Vil, who is one of those people that you occasionally run across and wish you hadn't. Cruella is quite simply an evil person, someone so self-involved that she really does not care about others at all. What makes her effective is that we know people like this, but sometimes we want to believe that they do not really exist. The film makes us confront them, makes us deal directly with a person evil enough to kill 99 helpless puppies for a simple fashion conceit. The effect is creepy enough to really make me feel for this family of dogs whose objective is only to live happily, and whose handicap is simple human greed and conceit. It is really very powerful.And what about child viewers? Oddly enough, they will not be traumatized by this movie as much as they might be. The reason is that the battle between good and evil is treated with real gentleness, and the good characters have great moments in the film. A scene where it appears that one of Pongo's puppies is born dead is treated with tremendous sensitivity. Another scene where Pongo and Perdita agree to take along another 84 orphan dalmatians rather than leave them behind for Cruella also is one that makes us cheer. Also, much of the conflict is treated with a comic flair that puts us at ease with some actually quite disturbing situations, and seems to deflate Cruella's menace. The result is that this is a great movie for kids. Evil Cruella is not sugar-coated but is put in proper perspective, a really impressive feat for a movie like this. At the same time, the movie is a thriller, a love story, a critique of the social class system, and an adventure film. It is a great movie.",9,3,3,25 August 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," New Look for the Series
","Rogue One is a very interesting new installment in the uber-famous Star Wars series. It is a true prequel, taking place immediately prior to the events of the original 1977 movie, and in effect tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance obtained the plans for the Death Star and why it has a technological weakness. The characters are relatively minor players in the Star Wars universe, but they rise in the movie to take a special place in Star Wars lore.In past installments, Star Wars movies generally stress character development and conflict as much or even more than the galactic struggle. Episode III, for example, is all about Annikin Skywalker's fall into evil, Episode IV is about Luke Skywalker's rise as a challenge and foil to that evil, Episode V their battle to convert each other to their respective sides of the force, and Episode VII the new awakening of the force in Rey and Kylo Ren as they become adversaries.Rogue One starts on this path--in the opening scene, a 7-year-old Jyn Erso watches the villain of the movie, Imperial stooge General Krennec, murder her mother and imprison her father in order to make him finish his scientific work on the Death Star. We might immediately assume that the main conflict of the movie will be between these two characters, and that she will become possessed of 'the force' like Luke Skywalker, but it actually does not happen that way. Jyn later in life is forcibly swept up into the struggle as the Rebellion is trying to get their mitts on the plans for the Death Star--they want her to enlist the assistance of her father and also the terrorist Saw Gerrera in that task. We learn that the Rebellion is fractured--consisting of outlaws, do-gooders, former Republicans, and other forces. A remarkable ensemble cast begins to assemble that sees the Empire as a common threat, and this ensemble, a roguish band, will become the actual main protagonist of the movie. The band will include a Rebel Spy--Cassian Andor, a converted Imperial tactical droid--K-2SO, an Imperial-pilot turned defector-- Bodhi Rook, and a random blind warrior--Chirrut Imwe, strong with the Force.What follows is a surprise--the ragtag group goes on a mission to retrieve the Death Star plans, and the suspected character study turns into a full-blown war movie/ensemble Western. The models for this are movies like The Magnificent Seven or Force 10 from Navarone, where a small gang of soldiers goes on a quest against impossible odds. The interpersonal stuff underlies a huge action picture with awesome war sequences both on the ground of a tropical planet and in the space above. The cliff-hangers and special effects are awe-inspiring. The ending is something of a surprise, even though it makes perfect sense given the plot of Episode IV that occurs right after.I really liked this movie, primarily because it takes the Star Wars series into some truly uncharted territory. This is really an exciting war movie above all else, a battle between good and evil on a different plane than the other movies. For those who might have thought Episode VII was a bit derivative, this is really something new.",7,2,6,23 December 2016
The Hunger Games," What Our World Really Looks Like to a Teenager
","As an older viewer and a schoolteacher, I was fascinated enough in my students' reactions to 'The Hunger Games' that I decided to roll it out of the Netflix one night and give it a view. I must confess I found it an odd movie--a strange mix of Rollerball and Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, where teenagers from different parts of a futuristic fascist society win a lottery for the privilege of killing each other in a spectacle designed to maintain the social order. This might sound ridiculous, at least put this way, except that in my mind the movie works. It does not work for the reasons that everybody says it does--the awesome action, the 'brilliant' dystopian premise (this is actually a cliché!), or the great marketing. I think it works because, if you have ever spent a fair amount of time with the modern teenager, you know that this movie really reveals something about the way that they perceive the world. Our society is dysfunctional (is it not?) in ways that especially hurt them, many kids have parents lacking in resources (yes?) or no parents at all to speak of, the privileged kids are sharpening their knives for the battle of winner take all, cliques form for the purpose of destroying you, etc. Furthermore, this perception is not just teenage angst--it is unique, truthful, often unseen by adults and revealed in this movie in a way that adults can digest it, if they take the trouble to take it seriously.The world of the Hunger Games movie is not realistic, it is not great literature, it probably does not measure up to its source novel or Battle Royale, the Japanese movie that everyone says it copies, but it is spot-on in depicting the modern world as viewed through the eyes of a teenager. In this movie, our teenagers get their revenge on us, showing us through the eyes of their mature- beyond-her-years hero Jennifer Lawrence exactly what our sick society is made of.",8,1,6,27 September 2014
The Hustler," A Study in Passion, Character, Victory and Love
","Robert Rossen's 'The Hustler' is a classic that not only is a great film but an influential piece of our cultural heritage. Paul Newman plays Eddie Felsen, a pool hustler who has his eyes set on a match with Minnesota Fats, the country's best. He meets up with Fats and is up $18000 after playing all night, but wallows in booze and glory until he has lost it all back to Fats. He ends up deserting his manager and sleeping in a bus station, where he meets the love of his life but has trouble realizing it. Most of the story involves Eddie trying to negotiate his relationship while at the same time summoning enough resources and self-respect to go at Fats again.The notion of 'character' is important in this movie, and I credit the movie with being one of the primary constructors of this value in our society. Eddie is a better pool player than Fats, but he loses because Fats has more staying power, determination, and level- headedness. The notion of a protagonist finding character has become such a common feature of movies (Rocky anyone?) that we forget that the idea, especially in sports movies, first really came to fruition here.But the movie is richer than this--Eddie's pursuit of the whatever- it-is that will help him beat Fats ends up having grave consequences, and we see that the movie is also about the rewards and dangers of passion and obsession. Eddie is passionate about pool and obsessive about winning, and this makes him blind to elements of the story that are very sinister.And the movie is also about love. Eddie is not a sympathetic character--one might even say he is an arrogant, insensitive, immature weasel. And yet Sarah loves him, holding out some hope that he will mature. But the maturity that leads him to victory in pool is not quite the same as that required of him to return her love, and the film helps us see this conflict brilliantly.This richness in themes, along with great technical and acting achievements, make this a film for the ages. We learn all about winning and losing, love, passion, skill, and character. It almost seems like the whole world is in this movie.",10,1,2,9 January 2015
Gettysburg," Reenactment with Actors
","Gettysburg, an adaptation of the novel by Michael Shaara, is a huge war epic that tells the story of the famous three-day battle in Civil War Pennsylvania. Like the novel, the film centers on the experiences of a few main characters, especially Joshua Chamberlain, the Yankee colonel commanding the 20th Maine regiment, and James Longstreet, the dour Confederate corps commander who foresaw the final disaster, and uses their lenses to tell the story of the battle as a whole. The film has a terrific ensemble cast including Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as Longstreet, Sam Elliot as Union cavalry commander John Buford, and Martin Sheen as Confederate army commander Robert E Lee.Gettysburg differs from its source novel, the Killer Angels, by projecting a sense of vastness and majesty. The battle scenes are done by thousands of volunteer reenactors, and the musical score by Randy Edelman projects a sweeping romantic breadth. The novel was more of a character study of Buford, Chamberlain and Longstreet and how they are essentially both killers and virtuous human beings at the same time ('Killer Angels'). The movie, on the other hand, gets caught up in the project of reenacting the battle as a sort of visual memorial to those who fought. Some scenes in the movie develop the book's characters well, but others seem a bit clunky and clichÃ©d. Also, because the movie follows the book in its narrative conception, some key parts of the battle are left out of the movie. Civil War buffs will notice these deficiencies and might wonder why the movie omitted such important details (the battle for Culp's and Cemetery Hills, for instance).On the other hand, this movie succeeds brilliantly in creating that sort of visual memorial that the makers were seeking. The reenactors perform a tour-de-force, really taking us to the center of the action. The tactics and strategies are very clearly relayed in the movie, the sense of terror and courage are all well projected. Northern and Southern ideologies are presented without bias so the audience can draw its own conclusions. The production is very lovingly done, with tremendous admiration for the officers and soldiers of both sides. It is also one of the rare movies that is four hours long but seems much shorter because of all of the very gripping drama that happens on screen.In short, Gettysburg will certain thrill the Civil War buffs, but will likely entertain and interest others as well. The time capsule is not perfectly faithful in all of its details, but its spirit is spot-on.",8,0,1,22 December 2016
We Were Soldiers," Realistic Tribute to All Affected by Vietnam
","There are many people writing reviews who are willing to make claims that this movie is 'realistic' or 'hogwash' or whatever. As someone who did not fight in the Ia Drang Valley, my first question would be-- how would you know? I will say this movie seemed pretty realistic to me, and Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, the writers of the book and participants in the battle seemed satisfied with it, so I bet you it is pretty real. And already, this is a big plus for this movie.What I think might be off-putting to some people is that fact that the movie has some big stars--Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear-- that we have seen a million times before. If the actors had been anonymous, I suspect that the movie would have seemed more 'realistic.' Gibson in fact does his Georgia drawl pretty well, but loses it every so often in one of his 'Braveheart' moments of pathos.Similarly, the musical score has a Scottish lament that seems bizarre for this movie. Are we still doing 'Braveheart'?On the upside however, we get corroboration from the participants that the war scenes are pretty real, and they are BRILLIANTLY choreographed. Ever since Saving Private Ryan, these movies have gotten A LOT more graphic. We Were Soldiers has some utterly gruesome scenes in it that are probably quite true to life. Again, this is a big plus, since we don't want to remember the fighting as anything but something very ugly.Also, unlike some other Vietnam films, there are some believable moments involving two parties not often heard from: the soldiers' wives and the enemy. Hal Moore's wife delivers death telegrams to the other vets' wives so that they don't have to receive them from the Yellow Cab company. I have no doubt that this was true, and the scenes are NOT melodramatic, they are heartbreaking.Similarly, one of the best characters of the movie is General An of the NVA. He is again terrifically believable as the sanguine commander of the enemy forces, and we see him as a clever, thoughtful and even compassionate commander heartbroken about the state of his country but willing to do what it takes to defend it. The mental duel that he has with Colonel Moore (Mel Gibson) also provides a terrific subplot.On balance, this movie is really worth it. In making a Vietnam movie that really tries to tell the story realistically, we get an excellent tribute not just to the US Vets, but also to everyone affected, even the Vietnamese foe. It is a tough movie to watch, but it is also perhaps the healthiest response to Vietnam that I have ever seen.",8,1,1,15 January 2015
Moana," Tremendous Movie
","Just saw Moana today and was completely blown away. Moana is the story of a princess of a Polynesian island paradise who senses that something is going wrong. Turns out the problem is that the mischievous demigod Maui has stolen the 'heart,' a jewel, from a neighboring island and this has cast a curse over her whole island society. The ocean chooses her to make a perilous journey across the sea to find Maui and get him to return the jewel and restore prosperity to her island.Moana is a startling film on a bunch of levels. The animation is not only magically crafted, it also has a great amount of variety and stunning beauty--no Disney film has ever fallen in love with its setting as much as this one. Moana also has an excellent musical score that pays great homage to the culture that it depicts with use of native instruments and choral stylistic elements. Moana has wonderful characters--Moana and Maui develop a terrific (non- romantic) relationship, as Moana helps Maui toward redemption from his terrible mistake and Maui turns her into a master voyager--in other words, helps her find her full potential as a human being.There is quite simply nothing to dislike about this movie--Disney at its absolute best.",9,12,32,25 November 2016
The Lego Movie," Clever, but disingenuous
","In the Lego Movie, and evil minifig named Lord Business has decided that he is tired of all of the creative people messing around with his stuff. He is already the most powerful creature in Legoland, but to eliminate the chaos he has decided to end the world by gluing it in place with the Kragle (actually a big tube of Krazy Glue). The masterbuilders can only count on the 'Special,' a minifig destined to save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle. Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.The Lego Movie is a new twist on an old idea, what some critics would call a dystopian science-fiction piece. These stared with George Orwell's 1984 and have come to full fruition recently in the movies with The Hunger Games. The purpose of these movies is to exaggerate some aspect of our society, usually an oppressive government or capitalist system, in order to 'expose' it.In the case of the Lego Movie, it is entirely peculiar that the villain is 'Lord Business.' After all, there are barely any better capitalist ventures in the world than Lego, and this movie in particular has already grossed $260 million. Making a boatload of money off of a critique of Capitalism strikes me as a bit disingenuous.Nonetheless, one of the reasons for the big gross is that this movie is actually pretty good. There's lots of laughs, great animation, even interesting plot twists and some genuinely touching human drama. You have to love a movie that gives prominent cameos to both Abraham Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neal. Fair to say you are likely to be entertained by this movie, and that is better that simply getting a boring infomercial for Legos.The problem is that these guys are criticizing Lord Business all the way to the bank.",5,12,21,21 January 2015
Goon," Entertaining Homage to Hockey Goons
","For those of you looking for a high-class, well-nuanced dramatic presentation, Goon is probably not for you. However, it is very funny and has a lot of heart in unexpected places, so is well worth a view for someone who likes sports movies and (extremely) vulgar comedy.The story revolves around Doug, a bouncer at an Ontario bar who one day beats up a hockey player at a minor league game who crawls into the stands to take out a fan. The performance is noticed by the home hockey coach, who invites him to a tryout. Doug can't even skate, but he is the toughest son-of-a-gun on the planet and is soon hired by the team to take out enemy goons. The movie traces Doug's remarkable and extremely tacky career as a hockey enforcer, up to a showdown with a famous bully from a rival team.This movie inevitably draws comparisons to Slap Shot, to which it is clearly indebted, but actually has a different slant than its predecessor. Slap Shot was an homage to teams like the 70s Flyers, who played a new rough and tumble style but whose players were still hockey players. Goon, by contrast, pays homage to a phenomenon of the 80s and 90s, single players hired by teams specifically to fight and do little else. Guys like Bob Probert, Chris Nilan, Derek Boogarde and others could barely play hockey, but made a very tough living being the body-guards of the skill players. Doug from Goon clearly plays that role.The movie gets a lot of comedic mileage out of the fact that these goons have no talent in the conventional sense; Doug is neither smart nor skilled, and we laugh at him because he is clear mockery of any sort of sporting ideal. Beyond that, he occupies a world that is so tacky that it is simply hilarious; the movie is at its best when it lovingly makes fun of the amazingly vulgar world of the minor-league hockey player. Doug is very sympathetic, however, because he is tough as nails and willing to take a nasty one for his teammate, and in the end it is this quality that ends up turning the tide for his team. We root for him because he is the type of person we like to be--a tough but ultimately kind-hearted lug who overcomes the odds by determination. At the same time the movie avoids the trap of taking itself seriously, and in the end gives us some good not-particularly-clean fun.",7,0,0,18 February 2015
Inside Out," Awesome for Both 6 year olds and grad students
","Inside Out is a rather unique viewing experience of the type that you can only get from Pixar. Most of the action takes place inside the brain of 11-year-old Riley, where her five basic emotions-- Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust-- are turned into cartoon characters that cooperate to help run her conscious and unconscious mind. The control room where they operate is thrown into turmoil when Riley's father gets a new job that forces the family to move from Minnesota to San Francisco. When Riley becomes isolated from her familiar core memories, her whole personality structure is threatened in ways that are brilliantly personified by the world of Pixar animation.The amazing thing about this movie is that it operates equally effectively if you are a 6-year-old viewer or if you are a grad student in psychology. The five emotions are dazzling characters in themselves, and provide a bunch of laughs for any kid (including mine, who persuaded me to go see it after he first saw it with his grandma). I have seen many negative reviews claiming that the movie is too abstract for young kids, but this was not my experience--although my son was definitely not up on all of the heady psychology that the movie explores, he was still able to be completely enthralled by the emotions as characters as in a traditional cartoon. I think that some people simply cannot believe that a movie that is so intellectual can be understood by kids of this age, but the fact is that it can.On the other hand, in some measure this movie is like a graduate seminar in psychology as if taught by a 6-year-old. We get to take a trip to various personality islands, aspects of Riley's personality that arise out of her core memories, we get also a journey in the subconscious (where the troublemakers are sent!), we ride on a train of thought which is actually a train, and we get lost in a maze of long term memories. And then we get to see how the various emotions compete and cooperate to serve the psyche as a whole. This is an absolutely dazzling psychology lesson at what seemed to me to be a rather high level.It should be said that this idea of a control room for a psyche has been done before--you can even point to a comical version in Woody Allen's Sleeper, for instance. What is new here is that it is done with such amazing intellectual sophistication, animation, and truly awesome childlike fun all at the same time. Also, watching Riley's battle to adjust to her new home, which is becomes very traumatic for her, is no joke and becomes the basis of an increasingly powerful story. The result is an incredible movie that takes the idea of simultaneous entertainment for all ages to a new and dazzling level.",9,6,29,2 August 2015
K-19: The Widowmaker," Decent Military Melodrama
","K-19 is the story of a Russian nuclear submarine that bites off more than it can chew; hastily rushed into production, the sub goes on a operational mission to test-launch a nuclear missile. Problem is that their reactor malfunctions and turns them into 1.5 megaton H- Bomb waiting to happen. The engineering crew has to resort to desperate/suicidal measures to get the problem under control.This is a fine premise for a thriller plot, and indeed Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson turn in their usual outstanding performances. The problem, however, is that the movie seems somehow a bit overdone. The action is accompanied by a sweeping romantic film score that often seems to impose its will and intrude on the action. Some scenes are done with a flair for melodrama and overacting that takes away from the outstanding human story.Still, it is a decent popcorn muncher.",5,0,1,29 May 2015
Million Dollar Baby," A Profound, Mature Boxing Movie
","There are two movies that Million Dollar Baby will immediately draw comparisons to--Raging Bull and Rocky. The reasons are obvious: boxing movies are a well-established genre, and any movie that enters the genre has to go up against the best. The good news is that Million Dollar Baby is not really like either movie, and attains a spot all its own in the genre. It does so by being a movie that locates its boxing plot within a very profound and mature view of the world, a view that sees the world's ugliness very clearly and moves its characters through it very realistically. It is a very truthful movie and a moving experience for the moviegoer.The plot involves an aging boxing trainer, Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, who trains champions but has a bad habit of protecting them when their opportunity comes. He is currently training a potential champion, but the prospect leaves his gym when he realizes that Frankie is gun-shy. Frankie is devastated by this, but finds a new prospect in an enthusiastic young woman, Maggie, with knockout power and a completely dysfunctional personal life. The victories begin to mount, and it looks like Frankie's (and Maggie's) chance at redemption is on its way. The rest I can't reveal without tripping the spoiler alert, but I will say that those expecting a girl Rocky are going to be thrown off-balance. In its outlook, Million Dollar Baby is a complete contrast to Rocky. While Rocky was made by a new, young filmmaker (Stallone) who captures what is ultimately a story of optimism, Million Dollar Baby is a story made by an old filmmaker (Eastwood) with a viewpoint which, if not pessimistic, is very sophisticated in identifying the particular aspects of life that are truly painful and difficult. This may seem like a downer, but the fact is that what you see is real--it is very refreshing to watch a real life and characters who show substantial courage as they make their way through. Frankie faces estrangement from his daughter, Frankie's janitor and resident sage, Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman) faces having gone one fight too many (he was a boxer) and Maggie, with her disaster of a family, faces the challenge of discovering some form of identity. The triumph of these characters is that they live at all, and in some respects they do transcend their circumstances. Unlike Rocky, it is an imperfect transcendence, and in some respects it often goes horribly wrong. But nonetheless, the richness of the conflicts and their resolutions makes this movie what it is. This and they amazing performances by veterans Eastwood, Swank and Freeman, and you really get the feeling of having seen something very deep.With Million Dollar Baby, you might not by singing 'Gonna Fly Now' or the 'Eye of the Tiger' but, as the film says, you had better 'protect yourself at all times,' because life can be even tougher than a boxing match.",9,0,3,15 October 2015
Titanic," Strangely Universal
","Watched this movie for a second time recently with my 17-year-old son. He actually suggested the viewing, he heard about the movie and was curious. Rarely have I had a better entertainment experience with a family member.Titanic is just simply awesome, a movie that you just sit back and marvel at. Photography, special effects, costumes, production are just incredible, with a real feel of authentic time travel back to 1912. Musical score also sweeping and emotional, of course with Celine Dion's favorite song and a wonderful orchestral sweep.A little more controversial is the screenplay and love story, which some commentators have portrayed as trite and even amateurish. What saves this movie, and in fact turns it into an instant classic, is that the characters are much more universal than they appear at first glance, and really have a great chemistry. Leonardo Di Caprio's Jack is an underdog orphan that has suffered great personal hardship, Kate Winslet's Rose is a young woman of great spirit completely stifled by her family and her society. You really can't help but root for them, and the chemistry between the two is absolutely fantastic. Put this story in the midst of one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, and at the very least you have a very potent formula, even if it is not executed perfectly at every turn. Often my son and I were laughing at some of the cliches in the midst of being completely absorbed in the unfolding drama.If you love movies, you will love Titanic, it is that simple. It is an emotional, gorgeous, romantic, sexy, awesome spectacle of a movie.",9,1,1,28 March 2020
Hercules," Ultimately Confusing
","Disney's Hercules is a curious movie that seeks to entertain but instead managed to provoke a lot of questions. I watched the movie on Netflix one night with my 6 and 12 year old sons, and got a reaction that was pretty typical for them with Disney movies--my 6 year old was scared of the violence and had to leave, and my 12 year old thought it was moderately entertaining. I was intrigued because the movie has gotten a lot of bad press for butchering the myths, but I got to wondering whether this had any effect on how you would judge the movie. Based on a lot of the online reviews I read, the answer seemed to be 'no', but enough people were offended that it got me thinking. What is the real effect of this infidelity on how we should judge the movie?In the end, I concluded that the lack of faithfulness to the myths is a serious problem, but not for the reasons that everyone is raising. Most of the objectors are doing so out of a love of the myths--they appreciate the original stories, and believe Disney has no right to mess with them. On the other hand, I think the problem is more subtle. The fact is that Disney movies generally follow a formula, are targeted at a specific age, and perform a sort of cultural work that is very consistent. Specifically, they are made for late elementary or middle-schoolers (note that my 6-year-old was afraid) and they basically are designed to instruct the age in certain moral lessons that are necessary for a child's development. The lessons are generally the power of love, friendship, self-sacrifice, hard work, etc.Now, the problem with Disney's Hercules is not that it does not do this effectively; in fact, it has the usual menu of good animation, good songs, morally aligned characters, etc. The problem is that the original myth is actually rather potent in our culture, and a kids' movie based on Hercules is simply disconcerting. The original Hercules is a character that murdered his family (wife and kids!) and performed labors to atone for his sins. His family was dysfunctional and his step-mom hated him and tried to do him in. He came into existence because his dad, the king of the Gods, was philandering. We know these facts too well--that fact makes this movie just too weird to really conceive of.And yet, here it is, with Hercules transformed into Superman or Beaver Cleaver or whatever. If you are the type who can successfully ignore all of this context, you might be able to watch this movie and enjoy the Gospel-Motown soundtrack. Maybe you can enjoy it like you might take in an episode of the Twilight Zone. I think, however, this was not the producers' intention.",5,1,3,25 February 2015
All Quiet on the Western Front," Shattered Illusions and Shattered Bodies
","There is not much more to say about how good this film is--everybody agrees that it is the classic anti-war film, the movie that you will most likely copy if you decide to go into the genre. I found it simply heartbreaking, and not just because the movie so accurately and compassionately portrays the terrors of war. What this film also does very well is portray the myth of heroism, which along with modern weaponry was so clearly instrumental in producing the mass slaughter of the Great War. It is completely believable that these boys were talked into thinking that they were fighting for a just and noble cause, and that they would be back soon with few losses. One kid after another has this myth shattered, and the scenes where they come to grips with it--that they are going to die, that their leg is gone, that they have been profoundly lied to and were the victim of colossal stupidity of the elders that were supposed to love them--this makes the film an almost unbearable watch. This is a brilliant, devastating movie.",10,1,2,2 January 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," Important Movie in American History
","To Kill a Mockingbird, based on the novel by Harper Lee, is a movie that is iconic, on the order of the Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. Unlike these other movies, the subject of this movie is the deadly serious topic of racial injustice. The movie and the book highlight the perverse nature of this injustice be letting it be seen through the eyes of children, the main characters. Their ordeal of witnessing the (most likely) unjust prosecution of a black man for rape represents a fall from innocence for the kids and a stark commentary on the sick nature of American racist society.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film. It accurately depicts human nature both at its most virtuous and most ugly. Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, an amazing character that lets us believe that we as human beings are capable of great compassion and love. Peck understates it but plays it with great passion, and the effect is extraordinary. On the flip side, James Anderson plays brilliantly Bob Ewall, a drunken bigot of the type we know that most likely beat up his own daughter and blamed it on Tom Robinson, the luckless defendant. The child actors, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, playing Scout and Jem, are terrific and take us along for their trip out of innocence.In my view, the most important thing about this movie is that it stands beautifully on the cusp of a key battle of ideas in the 60s-- the question of whether racism in any form is justifiable. The film is iconic because it provides a strong answer--NO.",9,1,3,21 October 2015
WALL·E," First droid love story
","It is very rare that I award a movie a 10 out of 10 on one of these reviews, but WALL-E fits the bill for that rating for sure. To earn the rating, you have to do something completely brilliant, something that really has not been done before. WALL-E does just that.The secret is the characters, and actually the trajectory of the artistic idea starts with the film to which WALL-E is most indebted, 2001: A Space Odyssey. In that movie, Stanley Kubrick decided it was time for a computer to be a real movie villain. The computer becomes a character, and actually turns malevolent. The idea touched a nerve that spawned an incredible number of spin-offs, most notably the Terminator movies, in which the idea is inverted (after the first movie), and the computer (machine) actually becomes a hero.In WALL-E, what happens is we get the first love story between two pieces of technology, and the question is seriously raised about the meaning of love and humanity. The possibility of full-bodied in-love droids that actually strive to save humanity make a very clever point that technology is not necessarily evil, it only becomes evil with careless use or lack of control. The love story is incredibly touching because it occurs between objects that are the product of human creation. The whole idea is really original.Add to this all of standard technical brilliance that we know of Pixar--awesome animation, music, etc., and WALL-E simply outdoes anything that Disney has done recently. It is rare to encounter a movie that is simply mind-boggling because of its originality.",10,1,2,25 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Remake of Episode 4, But Still Satisfying
","Star Wars, the Force Awakens, is a movie with a curious mission-- basically an attempt to reinvigorate a cinematic series which at its height was revolutionary but which lost its way in its prequel trilogy due to bad decision-making and mediocre film-making. The new reboot remedies this essentially by going back to the fundamentals, by trying very earnestly to recapture what made the movies so appealing to begin with. The effort is pretty good but, be warned, this movie is so derivative of episode 4 that you may be bothered. Like Episode 4, we once again start on a desert planet, this time Jaaku, where a resistance fighter, Poe Dameron, is trying to hide an important item in a droid (sound familiar?), BB8, to keep it out of the clutches of what looks like a new incarnation of the Evil Empire. We learned from the rolling narration at the beginning that the victory in Episode 6 was fairly short-lived--the First Order has arisen out of the ashes of the Evil Empire to challenge the new Republic, and the item in question is a map to the location of Luke Skywalker, who is missing. The First Order wants the map because destroying Skywalker could result in a permanent victory for the Dark Side. The droid finds its way to a scavenger Rey, who takes a liking to it. Meanwhile, Poe escapes from the First Order with the help of Finn, a disaffected storm-trooper, and they return to Jaaku to get the droid. Rey and Finn become the new reluctant heroes of the Resistance, and seek to return the droid to it. The escape from Jaaku reminds us again of the 4th movie, but the essential conflict of the film is set up.The good thing about this movie is that the film-makers have understood what makes these movies appealing. First and most importantly, their characters are interesting. Rey is a female Skywalker, having definite skills as a pilot and some mysterious connection with the Force. She evolves into a female action hero of the Jennifer Lawrence type and actress Daisy Ridley has serious charisma and talent in playing her. Finn, the turncoat storm-trooper is interesting because he is a new element, a person who escaped Dark Side brainwashing to assert his individuality. John Boyega plays him very well. The new villain, Kylo Ren, reminds us a lot of Darth Vader, but has new elements and a very compelling relationship to Han Solo that gets played out in the film. The character study here is more absorbing than we have seen in a while.Additionally, the new movie captures the visceral sense of the original trilogy. The action is fast, furious and fun in a way that the prequel movies never achieved, and really has us on the edge of our seat. Some of the scenes are a little too familiar--for example the deal making in a new version of the Cantina, or the emergence of a Dark Side super-weapon that must be taken out. There really is a sense of a remake here.Lastly, however, the filmmaking is simply better. The script is better written, the special effects are awesome but not distracting. Most importantly, the movie relies much more on great cinematography than the prequel movies--it is a beautiful movie to watch from the standpoint of the camera, with great locations in Abu Dhabi and Ireland. Bottom line is that with many aspects of the original trilogy returning, there is much to like about this film. It is basically an attempt to draw in a new generation of fans but going with what works.",8,2,14,20 December 2015
Flight," Spot-On Drama About Addiction
","If you have ever wondered what it would be like to be an extremely talented person with a horrible substance-abuse problem, Flight is definitely the movie for you. Alcohol and coke contain the seeds of destruction for pilot Whip Whitaker, and a disastrous mechanical failure on a flight to Atlanta push his life of deception and denial to a point of catastrophe. Whip saves the flight with a Sully Sullenberger style maneuver, but the truth is that he was bombed when he came to fly the plane, and a lawyer hired by the pilot's union has to do colossal damage control to keep the word from getting out. Whip recovers from the crash on his farm and finds a fellow addict to share a relationship of sorts during the convalescence, but this relationship, like his already-destroyed marriage, is quickly on the rocks because of his continued drinking (sorry about the nasty puns). What makes this movie special is that most of the details about the addiction are very believable, and then are elevated to an utterly- truthful status by Denzel Washington's brilliant performance. Washington gives a perfect picture of a man who is talented and appealing in many ways, but whose soul is completely death-gripped by the booze and drugs. It is a sad story told brilliantly.The end of the movie, I will say, is perhaps not realistic. I cannot go into details, otherwise I would have to check off the spoiler box, and so the film has a flaw (see it for yourself!). The filmmakers to some extent paint themselves into a corner with it, and perhaps it could have happened, but I don't believe it. Nonetheless, everyone should go and watch the addict and be appalled.",8,3,4,4 January 2015
