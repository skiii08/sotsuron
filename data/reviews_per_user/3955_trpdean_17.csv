The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Beautifully filmed, lyrical doodling that don't make a movie
","This is a beautifully filmed movie, with music that conveys an extraordinary atmosphere of mystery and longing. One sees the wandering of the main characters in this sort of spiritual daze, and the movie lets us attempt to fill in its 'meaning' with everything that appears  on screen.
As beautiful as it is, I found it extremely tedious. I think the director could have put anything on screen and had the same reviewers leaping about for the meaning of the symbolism. (In fact, some reviewers simply have it wrong - e.g., although the puppeteer is initially shown as manipulative, within five minutes, the main character is saying that she's always loved him - it is she, not he, who empties the contents of her purse when he says he wishes to know all about her).The movie is like a poem with many beautiful images and no point - except the myriad of 'meanings' that different readers will impart to it. One needn't like American movies to want a story - it's a pretty human desire. One wants a point in virtually all poetry as well - there's a thread that carries one stanza into the next - whether one's reading Shelley or Heine or Rilke, Gautier or even Verlaine. They want to tell us something - this movie sets up the premise and lets it drift like a cloud.  There's a very Kafkaesque story-like feel to this movie. Yet in Kafka, the main character always seeks meaning - he is rational and is alternately cowed, defiant, driven in his attempts to find out the truth. Not so with our main characters here - they are aimless.As beautiful as this movie is, there's really no point to it. The movie asks a question 'what if...?' and doesn't attempt to answer it. I can't say that I thought it was a waste of time - it's obviously lovely, care has clearly been taken - and it does create an atmosphere of fuzzy longing and cloudy beautiful mystery. But it's not enough.",Null,8,19,9 September 2002
Au Revoir les Enfants," Slow tedious movie with anticlimactic end
","I've just seen the movie (available on VHS actually for the reviewer who complained) and have read the universally admiring comments made below - and I'm afraid I didn't have the same reaction.First, it's not a BAD movie at all - it's obviously made with care, and has a very realistic feel throughout - it seems almost as if a camera were simply rolling at a school and the film was then edited. The details of dress, of horseplay, of conversation all sound quite realistic.Unfortunately for me, that didn't mean they were interesting. The movie seems almost formless - until the uninteresting climax we expected throughout. If I had found either the central character or his brother appealing, I might have a different reaction - but I don't. They are very realistically presented - and quite unlikeable. The whole movie feels very episodic - with one episode having little to do with the subsequent episode. I suppose much of life is this way - yet in a drama, I want to see something that's more shaped into a story.I kept wanting to fast forward the movie to see how much longer it would go on. Nor is the story very original -- from The Two of Us (which may have been the first French movie I ever saw) to The Angry Harvest to A Love in Germany (though that time a Polish POW instead of a Jewish civilian), we are used to The Pianist to Enemies to the Diary of Anne Frank, the hiding of Jews during W.W.II is very well-trodden ground. No subject is ever entirely plowed - and if there were some particular insight this time, I might have been more intrigued. Alas...I actually regret the reaction I had - because this movie apparently means so much to so many - but although the review stating that it felt 'lived in' is completely true, that didn't make it interesting. One may have a remarkably accurate memory of something - and more remarkably be able to recreate it on screen, but this meandering story simply didn't hold my interest.",Null,6,16,29 June 2003
The Natural," Astonishing Magical Movie About Myth and Redemption
","I've seen the movie several times, in the theater and on television, and have read the book on which it is based. (Malamud's book is wonderful but a quite different affair - dark, more expressly magical, mysterious, pessimistic). The movie is majestically sentimental and mythic - about the most sunny of boyhood dreams and the crashing of those dreams through sin, about resilience and patience, being stalwart in the face of snares, and the possibility of redemption. The whole movie has such a Biblical tone - man's original sin (through woman?), the casting out from the Garden of Eden, the years of seeking salvation, the years in the wilderness, the limitation on man's perfection due to original sin. The 1930s/40s atmosphere is perfection. The acting of Glenn Close and Robert Redford is just so wonderful. The whole of this movie is fabulous - a grand fable, powerfully moving. From sets to music, from costume to lighting, from editing to sound, the movie is captivating.  I may have seen all of Redford's movies - this is his best. It is also so American that if you were to see this overseas, you would be homesick.",Null,0,1,23 January 2002
A Bridge Too Far," Very well done movie of conventional style
","This movie is naturally often compared to The Longest Day. Both have enormous casts of stars involved in a number of subplots telling  the story of a major campaign in W.W.II and both are taken from Cornelius Ryan wonderfully detailed books. However, unlike The Longest Day, this movie is of a flawed military campaign and was made after Vietnam by a dovish older director (Richard Attenborough) with a fine but conventional style. The contrast with the graphic violence of other movies at the time and since (from Mean Streets to The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now to Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas to Saving Private Ryan) makes the movie's style (and its  determined use of many huge stars) appear old-fashioned. Yet you sense that the tone of Saving Private Ryan is what the director wanted - he doesn't quite get it because there are too many stories. (Had he shown only the Anthony Hopkins group at Arnheim, he may have achieved more of the effect he wanted). Thus, the movie falls a bit between two stools. It uneasily has both a derring-do musical score and a darkness about the carnage one sees in 'Enemies at the Gates'. The movie has both the sort of humor always shown in war movies before the 1970s (the roles of Elliott Gould and to some extent James Caan come to mind) and a compassion for the wounded one would see in very anti-war movies such as Platoon. Overall, I quite liked the movie- the story itself is far more interesting than most movies, and the acting is quite good. The many star parts are both enjoyable and distracting.I'd definitely recommend it - just know that its style isn't as harrowing in the way of movies such as The Deer Hunter, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan, nor is its content the kind of flag-waver such as movies like Rambo or made before Vietnam. It's a very enjoyable mix.",Null,2,4,28 November 2001
Gettysburg," Vivid, well worth seeing, faithful to book,heartbreaking ending
","This movie picks up steam as it goes along - leading to its wrenching end, as did the battle.  The performance of Richard Jordan as Lo Armistead must be singled out for praise - his anguish was very moving. I'd loved the actor in The Friends of Eddie Coyle and what a job he does. (It helps that he's given the best lines in the movie). Martin Sheen as Robt. E. Lee is not the first name that would come to mind - but I think he gave a fine performance - his accent was entrancing. Sam Elliott is perfectly chosen as (and wonderfully played) the western General John Buford. I also think Jeff Daniels was absolutely wonderful - conveying so well the different manner of someone who until a year before, had been a civilian professor, not a colonel. Unfortunately although I'm generally a fan of Tom Berenger, I wasn't particularly moved by any scene he was in - he kind of walks through it.The movie is written so well - and its pace just fine. There are so many interesting scenes, touching on many different aspects of life and war - from the nature of man and race to the paradox of a general loving his army yet having to sacrifice it. Jordan brought home so well the closeness of the senior officers to those on the other side. I loved how well they showed the varied purposes for fighting of the different armies, and the occasional reference to a perceived resentment by the Union soldiers over what they saw as Confederate pretensions to higher social class. ('They're so arrogant', etc.). The music is first rate - and definitely enhances the drama. The depiction seems quite authentic. Some niggling criticisms: aside from the map at the start of the movie, there is none. Maps would definitely have helped to undeerstand the overall picture. People commonly refer to directions (from the norht, from the west, etc.) or 'we must flank them to the right' and it's hard to understand if you haven't read about the battle.The scene with the runaway slave is too abbreviated from the book - it doesn't have much impact in the movie. Kevin Conway's dialogue and accent was a bit over the top, and the English military attache was rather clicheed.For all that General Hancock is referenced, we see very little of him.We see the diatribe by General Trimble against General Ewell - but without seeing anything of that battle (or Ewell ever), it just hangs there - rather than being part of any continuous story. (In the book, Ewell's and Early's conduct is more discussed - including a wonderful scene by the two with Lee). If they weren't going to discuss that side of the battle, they should have left Trimble's (well-played) trembling anger out of the story - it doesn't belong in this movie.Gen. Longstreet is the star of the book and movie - yet I never sensed from Berenger the great brooding quality (and he wasn't given any reference to the fact that his thre children had just died) that he has throughout the battle - according to the book. Similarly, Gen. Lee's health (his heart and headaches, etc.) is a constant factor - not shown in the movie.
Despite the criticisms, this is a wonderfully done movie - from a Pulitzer Prize winning book. It's long - but quite clear, and very deeply moving. I defy anyone to see the last 1/2 hour and not have tears in their eyes. I'd very strongly recommend this.",Null,45,54,22 February 2003
Lost in Translation," Really disliked it
","I agree with those who really disliked the movie. It was charmless. I cared for neither character because I never felt I'd any reason to like either one. Nor did I find them so beset with pressing problems that my pity was evoked - The man can routinely ring up his wife if he wishes to have a chat (though he's a way for a few days earning a few million dollars) and receives her attention with almost daily faxes and mail seeking his opinion on matters affecting them.And the young woman has a husband who seems to yearn for her company and seek to do whatever he can while there on business to make her happy.I felt I knew nothing of either of the principal characters - and never felt either had any serious problem with which I ought to be concerned.If I'd felt that there was a charm in the film -- some kind of wonderful dialogue or charming imaginative behavior in which the two engage, I'd have enjoyed it perhaps - even if I'd otherwise felt nothing for the characters -- but alas.(I do wonder sometimes why movies from 70 years ago seemed effortlessly to carry dialogue one would always remember (from Constance Bennett speaking to Cary Grant in Topper ro Myrna Loy speaking to William Powell in their 13 or so films -or Carole Lombard speaking to Fred MacMurray).Sadly this is just utterly charmless and flat.I am surprised I disliked it as much as I do - I'd not have seen it if I hadn't quite expected to like it.There really are quite good movies out there - don't waste your time.",2,4,11,30 July 2006
The Bourne Identity," Disappointing
","This was a real disappointment. I've neither seen the book or the earlier TV miniseries - but although the acting, direction and scenery are nice - the plot is shot through with holes. About fifteen times I found myself angry that Bourne does something that no one would do - and so many small things didn't make sense. It also feels quite dated - in these times when most Americans hope that the CIA has plenty of assassins (not just drones) to destroy our enemies.
This is really bad - hokey, unattractive female lead, so many things that cause you to doubt Bourne's intelligence. If you're in the mood for a good movie of this kind set in Europe - see Ronin - it's much better.",Null,0,2,10 June 2003
Dunkirk," Quite disliked it
","I was bored so much of the film - the plethora of characters about whom one knows nothing - and thus cares little; the remarkably confusing story line (three story lines - which cover one week, one day and one hour - in which we are supposed to see one line's incident reflected in the other story line at an earlier or later time - but this means we wonder which of the 17 times we see a ship blown up is significant to which point in another story line at a different point in the movie? Which of the planes we see knocked down is one we saw at another point - or shall see at another point from a different perspective? We don't care); the indifferent film score - nothing too grand, no real crescendo, nothing that could be described as patriotic; long long stretches in which nothing happens; the deliberate undercutting of the idea of the people as having an idealism great than self-interest - and many of the principal characters deliberately sabotaging the overall effort - or deceiving others - or acting in a xenophobic way - or committing suicide out of fear ... anything to undermine a 'spirit of Dunkirk' emotional feeling; All this is quite deliberate by the director - and to have just spent $50 ($23.50 for the IMAX seat, another $27 for a hot dog, soda and popcorn) - simply makes one far more reluctant to attend a movie - no matter the many (wrong-headed) plaudits.",2,13,21,20 August 2017
Zulu," Best Action Movie I've Ever Seen
","Simply thrilling. What a movie! This story of a battle is breath-taking. The sheer action, the music generate so much suspense. The humanity of the characters is so brought home (their fear and bravery, their wonder, their homesickness, their pride, their laziness, their social snobbery). As wonderful as anyone would find this movie, I do have some criticisms: a) the cleric's role - one assumes he's introduced to put additional pressure on the soldiers attempting to do their duty - yet no one seems to pay attention, so what was the point of his scenes? I can understand Jack Hawkins' irritation at the way the character is portrayed - a scared drunken weak buffoon instead of a serious pacifist, b) I think Caine overplays the aristocratic officer - it needn't mean utterly effeminate, c) the soldiers' frequent crediting of the Zulus as if they were simply a contending rugby team is not very believable - it's hard to imagine a war in which one doesn't really hate and despise the enemy for killing one's friends, and d) the character of Hook seemed a bit of a clicheed cockney.That aside, wow! This is what John Wayne's The Alamo should have been like - instead much was frittered away in subplots.  The courage of the moviemaker to show one battle - without silly subplots about the characters' interaction, a fictitious romantic story, or long expository scenes about the genesis of the Zulu Wars - is remarkable. I've seen this perhaps a half dozen times. Everyone I know who has seen it, tells his friends.",Null,11,14,25 September 2002
The Pianist," Very well done movie of a ghetto survivor
","Although I'm going to make some criticisms of the movie, I want to first say that I think it's very finely done. The acting, the sets, the music, the lighting, the overall direction are first rate. We are moved again and again and reminded of man seeking survival at all cost. IT is definitely worth seeing - and it clearly deserved the honors it received.
Unfortunately, I don't think it's as wonderful as it might have been. It's very straightforward - there seem too few moments of imagination. Undoubtedly, the overall facts of Jewish life in Poland in the 1940s are of course going to bear similarities.  Yet, e.g., a survivor's hunt for food and water in civilian houses during W.W.II - I kept thinking 'I've seen this before' - and Eureka! Yes, I had - in Empire of the Sun. The separation of the Jewish family - some marked for the concentration camps and some not, the uprising in the ghetto - I kept thinking 'Where have I seen this?' Oh, yes, in the miniseries, Holocaust. The use of music as the counterpoint to Nazi horror and escape from death - where have I seen this before? Oh yes, Vanessa Redgrave in Playing for Time. The railroad siding at which some are spared from the death camps - gee, I've seen that before. Oh yes, Sophie's Choice (which was far more gripping).It's not that I dislike movies from or about the Holocaust. I think there's always room for more stories from the Holocaust - and I suppose Polanski is going to be drawn to it more than to, say, the horror of the imposed famine in Ukraine in the 1930s -- but I would like to see more imagination used in the telling. (E.g., in Empire of the Sun, the juxtaposition of the dying breath from a woman's body and the protagonist's certainty he sees it merged into the mushroom cloud from Hiroshima - or the wonder at the stadium full of looted luxury taken by the Japanese - or the transformation of a prisoner of the Japanese from idolizing their strength to idolizing the Americans' strength - the last particularly was very human and seldom acknowledged in movies). Or in Lawrence of Arabia - the use of light is so extraordinary (the match being blown out, the figure of Lawrence along the tops of rail cars, etc.) These are striking memorable images -and unfortunately The Pianist doesn't have much that is distinctive visually. Still and all, it's an excellent movie - well worth seeing.",Null,0,1,10 June 2003
Rules of Engagement," Overall good film with some unfortunate clichÃ©s
","This is a well-made gripping movie -- with a great cast. Its central issue is quite timely.**** SPOILERS **** The film concerns the firing upon an American Embassy in Yemen by dozens and dozens, perhaps hundreds of people - some on the roof of a building across the courtyard, more in the courtyard itself. Audio tapes of speeches or sermons (it's not clear which) in which the people are informed it is their duty to God to kill Americans are later found at the Embassy and by the bedsides of some of the people.After three Marines rescuing the Ambassador have been shot, the furious fire from the Yemenis is returned by a Marine detachment that has rescued the American Ambassador and his wife to safety. The return fire kills 83, wounds another 100, and successfully stops the attack.The courtyard is immediately cleaned by Yemenis of all the weapons dropped by the dead and wounded -- and then photographs are taken of the dead and wounded lying there. The governments in Yemen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan all decry the action taken by the Marines and Ambassadors are withdrawn.The photographs are published in newspapers. The Embassy's outside television camera has recorded the dozens of old people, children and others who were firing machine guns at the Embassy and the Marines -- but in order to blame the Marine colonel in charge of the rescue, the National Security Adviser destroys the tape.The central drama is the court martial of the Marine colonel in charge -- defended by a former comrade from the Vietnam War. The Marines who were present at the incident had been under cover and unable to see the courtyard and the dozens firing upon the Marines. Only the Colonel in charge and another Marine who died on the spot were in a position to see the crowd.There are three unfortunate matters in the movie: i) the clichÃ© of 'higher ups' being utterly evil and willing to do anything to blame others - in this case, it's just so difficult to believe that someone as senior as the National Security Adviser who had absolutely nothing to hide -- would deliberately destroy evidence that would exculpate the colonel.ii) the clichÃ© of the North Vietnamese having been somehow 'honorable' -- and available to testify in courts martial in Washington D.C. The salutes exchanged between the Marine colonel and the former North Vietnamese soldier at the end of the film -- made me cringe.iii) the entire motivation of the National Security Adviser - there's no reason whatever to think that the conviction of a Marine colonel is going to lessen anger at the United States for the incident. If anything, I would think (a false) establishment of the Marines' guilt for these deaths would increase, rather than diminish anger at the U.S. So the motivation of the National Security Adviser that 'if this man isn't convicted, the U.S. will be blamed' makes no sense to me -- yet that is the entire motivation for the destruction of the exculpatory evidence.The action sequences are absolutely gripping - and seem very realistic. So are the scenes that take place when the Marine's lawyer journeys to Yemen to search for any further evidence.Another matter I liked as a litigator, was seeing the judge make correct judicial rulings throughout the trial. The courtroom scenes are fine stuff - similar to 'A Few Good Men' in drama.**** SPOILERS END **** The cast is astounding - Blair Underwood, Anne Archer, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Sir Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce. They're all quite fine - Jackson and Jones are superb. I was surprised that actors of the caliber of Archer, Underwood and Kingsley would take such small parts - they don't have terribly much to do. And I found the Australian Pearce's extremely thick New York accent quite off-putting - he sounded American, but phew - what an ugly sound.This is a gripping film that will certainly hold your interest throughout - and despite a few clicheed improbabilities, is quite well done.",7,1,2,5 November 2005
Black Hawk Down," Graphic, Gripping Story of Battle from American Soldiers' Point of View
","This movie about a single battle is so gripping, so relentless in its realistic gore and horror and astonishing courage - that it's difficult to credit the complaints. I'm sure everyone I know would be enthralled.
So perhaps I can comment on some of the comments. 1) Some complain that it portrays the battle from the American soldiers' point of view. Offhand, I can think of only two that do not ('Tora!, Tora! Tora!' and Gettysburg). From Paths of Glory to Grand Illusion, from All Quiet on the Western Front to Saving Private Ryan, from Back to Bataan to Zulu, from Thin Red Line to Northwest Territory- we see war in movies through the eyes of one or other side. To complain that this renders the enemy 'unimportant' or 'zombies' or that their deaths don't matter, is silly. Sure, we know there are dead British soldiers in the trenches during All Quiet, dead British fliers in Blue Max, dead French soldiers in Battle of Algiers - but these movies aren't from the British or French points of view - they're from the German and Algerian points of view. What's wrong with that?Movies need a place from which to look. When we see a cavalryman killed in fighting Native Americans in Soldier Blue, Little Big Man, or Dances with Wolves, which are all from an Indian point of view, of course we know the deceased were human - but the movies aren't from the white cavalrymen's point of view - and that's fine. It doesn't demean the enemy of those from whose perspective we're watching the movie. A second complaint seems to be that the movie somehow 'whitewashes' the American presence. This is absurd. There was a single initial reason to send American troops - the vast numbers of deaths due to starvation, brought home on American television news every night. Such images came immediately upon American failures to act in the Serbian-Slovenian War, Serbian-Croatian War, and Serbian-Bosnian-Croatian War, and the tens of thousands of atrocities committed (by all sides - but by Serbs and Bosnian Serbs in far greater numbers). Moreover, the UN and European Union had so dismally failed through vacillation, incompetence and weakness to stop the massacres in Srebenica, the bombing of Dubrovnik, the starvation and bombings of Sarajevo and Mosul, and dozens upon dozens of other towns and cities - that there was a sick feeling that we MUST be able to act in Somalia to alleviate the suffering.
The American arrival stopped further starvation in Somalia, despite the banditry and robbery by the warlords. Food WAS distributed and for the most part got to Somalians. Three hundred thousand had already died, but yet further deaths were largely avoided. President Bush left office with only half as many American troops still there - and a plan for UN troops to replace those remaining. UN pressure on American policy caused the U.S. to expand its purpose after President Clinton was inaugurated. UN Sec'y. General Boutros Boutros Ghali (of Egypt) had a natural and strong desire to unify and pacify Somalia to help Somalis escape from their decades of violent horror. He knew well (and despised) chief warlord Aidid from Ghali's own days in Egypt. Under pressure from Ghali, American policy changed from the apolitical distribution of food to the political one of capturing or killing Aidid and/or defeating his troops in order to afford Somalia some future hope of building a unified nation-state. After all, one might argue, isn't that what the UN is supposed to do? Nevertheless, UN troops were scheduled to replace the remaining American troops - but shortly before they were to leave, Pakistani UN troops were ambushed by Aidid's forces and dozens killed. The pressure from Ghali grew - U.S. troops were already there - they must do something to capture Aidid (thus opening hope for Somalia's future) and to discourage future attacks on UN troops. Clinton reluctantly agreed - and the American forces changed purpose.
Some of this is spelled out by the movie - but I wish it were made more clear. Thus I agree with the third common complaint - that we don't see enough backstory - of why we were there, and of who these particular characters were. Those who say it's like a 'video game' are harsh - but do have a point. We need to know more about these people - despite the (largely boring) initial 20 minutes, we aren't given characters to hold onto - and it's more difficult because everyone is in uniform. We move very quickly among two dozen young white men in uniform - and it's hard to grasp who is who.That aside, this is very powerful stuff. All should see it. I highly recommend it - if you can take MUCH graphic violence. The heroism is astounding.",Null,0,1,12 August 2003
The Insider," Poor one-sided melodrama - much heat, little light
","Caution: Contains spoilersI disliked this movie. Generally, I found it boring - and yet somehow also confusing (e.g., the absence of any warning, for example, when Pacino would suddenly be reviewing tape or showing up somewhere - and you are trying hard to understand how this fits into the Wigand story - and it doesn't - it's another story Pacino's working on altogether!).One of the primary problems with the movie is that it is the gospel according to one tendentious self-righteous character - one who cares nothing at all for confidentiality provisions. I suppose this is a journalistic flaw generaly - to feel that some agreements are critical (e.g., an agreement with a source) and others are entirely worthles (e.g., a confidentiality provision in an agreement with a government or in this case, corporate employee). Why this should be so is unexplained.Thus we hear Pacino's character rant about sources distrusting him in the future because the source's story was excised from a broadcast - we don't hear a word from Crowe's character about whether any employer will ever again trust him after he's agreed to take unearned compensation and free health insurance in a severance agreement in exchange for his confidentiality - and proceeds to betray the corporation's trust.So, for what critical news does the movie see the confidentiality provision as valueless? That cigarettes are referred to at one of the tobacco companies as a 'nicotine delivery system' and that the company continued to use an ammonia-based additive that more quickly delivers the rush to the nervous system and bloodstream (for which people buy cigarettes) even while Crowe's character was working on a replacement. That's it! From this, Crowe's character grandly gives HIS view of Brown & Williamson's CEO's mental state as deceitful when that man testified that cigarettes were not addictive because nicotine was not a drug. Wow! This is news? YOu mean, they WEREN'T telling the truth? You mean cigarettes AREN'T EASY to stop smoking? I clearly recall the day after the CEOs gave that testimony before Congress that it produced nationwide ridicule - editorials in all the major newspapers, sarcastic commentary by magazines. The nation freely mocked the obvious lies.And for THIS, CBS must induce Crowe's character to violate his freely-agreed upon confidentiality provision - a provision for which he was handsomely paid (he says) and that took care of all the health needs of his children? I truly don't get it!Moreover, the movie is confusing in failing to properly emphasize the plot points. They only glancingly mention that the original broadcast is aired AFTER Wigand's testimony before a Mississippi trial is spread in newspapers around the country. The movie had already told us that his deposition testimnony in that case was 'under seal'.  So what happened? This is the movie's turning point- now it is no longer confidential - so CBS is free to broadcast Wigand's story - there is no danger any more of a judgment (properly) entered against CBS. How was the order committing the testimony under seal changed? Did the judge reverse himself? Did an appellate court overturn it? We never know.Instead, the movie emphasizes the telling of the inside story of the excision of Wigand's testimony to the NY Times - why would that change any of the minds of the CBS corporate heads or counsel? They didnt' seem to care that Wallace led off the original broadcast with his disagreement with CBS' decision - so why would they care now? The movie doesn't make it clear.What HAS changed is the viability of a suit against CBS - originally it was likely - now the information is no longer confidential so CBS is free to run Wigand's interview. Yet the movie somehow treats this as incidental - BECAUSE the movie doesn't take seriously the threat of suit, the likelihood of judgment and dismisses the entire notion of confidentiality agreements (at one point referring to suits for tortious interference with such agreements as 'something that sounds like bad radio reception').
Ludicrously, the movie (in a very conspiratorial tone) tries to make something of the fact that CBS executives would fail to gain from a pending merger of CBS and Westinghouse due to such a lawsuit - AHA! That's why they're squelching the story. The move fails to follow through on its reasoning. Why would they fail to gain? Becuase of the perception that such a suit would be successful - as successful as the Mississippi lawyers' suits against tobacco! And both for good reason - because contracts are respected by law - not only in the U.S. but in every country on earth. The movie doesn't care.The worst scene is during the deposition of Crowe in the Mississippi case - when a tobacco lawyer properly objects to testimony that appears to invade the confidentiality of his client's commercial information - and in fact to induce breach of a specific agreement by the witness (Crowe) - against whom a court in Kentucky has already weighed the likelihood of success in a suit and issued a restraining order against Crowe's testimony. In response, the anti-tobacco lawyer hysterically screams at the anti-tobacco lawyer that they are in Mississippi rather than Kentucky - and then absurdly yells he should 'take that smirk off his face'. The movie then shows the little villain cowed - the smirk disappears. Snidely Whiplash is defeated.
This is a truly poor movie. It's a movie that fails to have a single person defend such agreements in general or in this particular - instead it creates strawmen who give personal reasons for not running the story ('I'm too old to buck the system' or 'I unhesitatingly obey authority and this is what they say' or 'I am nothing without CBS'). How about 'this is not very newsworthy and we may be doing something very wrong, because I respect such freely negotiated agreements?' NOpe.The movie is agit-prop - often illogical. I was truly disappointed - I expected a LOT better.",1,19,43,4 February 2002
Chariots of Fire," Great true story, wonderfully done
","I watched this again last night. I had forgotten just how beautifully done it was - both a character study of two very different men and a gripping plot of their attempts to succeed - partly through athletics. the writer and director so well convey both Cambridge and the Edinburgh Presbyterian missionary disciples, in the early 1920s so very well.The acting is superb - I had never seen a character presented like Eric Liddell in movies - how fine Ian Charleson was in this role, the softness of his voice, his ease and joy in running competitively (especially in contrast with the tense tortured Harold Abrahams). I also loved the more supporting roles - I've read a biography of F.E. Smith and Nigel Davenport is exactly how I would imagine him. The actor who played the Prince of Wales also seemed exactly right with his effortless charm, looks, and lack of imagination. Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson - all wonderful.The actors weren't chosen for glamour either - Liddell and Abrahams are not Leni Riefenstahl images of athletic ideals, Liddell's sister is no beauty - and Abrahams' girlfriend is pretty but not stunning. It made them seem more real. (In nice contrast were the near-pretty boy looks of Nigel Havers as Lord Lindsay - it so suited his character).The races are riveting - partly due to the music and sound effects.So many small things are done so well - e.g., when Lord Lindsay has the confidence of his class to barge into a room containing the Prince of Wales, and three other lords (including Birkenhead and the head of the British Olympic Committee) and greets them by name - no need for introduction there (as there was for Liddell). It's small but seems quite real.As an American, it was interesting and funny to see our Olympic team shown as the numerous, ominous, invulnerable 'other'! (something like watching a Rocky movie with Rocky as the product of a Russian or East German success machine!). In fact, the one scene that seemed a bit off was the scene of the American track athletes warming up for the Games - all heavy music, machine like athletes, ferocious coach yelling with a megaphone into people's ears. It pounded too hard on the 'these are the scary almighty inhuman opponents' theme in contrast to the cheerful British boys running along the beach.Something I had forgotten about the movie was how stubborn BOTH protagonists are - Liddell fully as much as Abrahams. Liddell is not overly deferential or bashful when dealing with the Prince of Wales - but instead straightforward and very firm. I truly can't understand anyone not liking this movie - it is very exciting even on the basic level of 'will they win?' and so much more. (For example, Ian Holm's character's reaction to success after 30 years is very moving). Those who write to say that 'Reds' deserved the Oscar more - are simply wrong. (Reds was so simplistic that it felt like watching the movie 'The Hardy Boys Go to the Russian Revolution'). Those who say they cannot differentiate among the boys or between the Scottish and English accents - well, it sounds like some political statement to me. Do watch it - it's very fine, very moving, very exciting.",Null,118,136,6 March 2002
Back to the Future Part II," Less heart, but more clever than original
","There's something about seeing one's parents when they were your age, that is very moving and powerful. That made so much of the sentimental appeal of the original. That's absent this time - but this movie does far more very cleverly with the whole time machine logic. I kept thinking 'how clever' and 'wow, how ingenious' throughout the movie. **** SPOILERS ****I did think of one logical error - why is it that when the girlfriend sees her future self, she faints dead away (as does her future self) - after much fun/silly spiel about how the universe might implode if this were to occur - and later Marty attempts very hard to avoid seeing himself. However, when Biff goes back to 1955 and sees his former self, there's no problem for either him or his young self?There's also a slight problem I had in the almanac retrieval. We are to believe that Marty's been locked in the garage for many hours until Biff comes out to drive to the dance. Since Biff is unaware that Marty is in the garage, why can't Marty have simply taken some large object into the back seat with him and hit the unsuspecting Biff on the back of the head with it when Biff sits down in front of him, taking the  almanac back?
**** spoilers end ****That said, this is much fun - spinning out of clever ideas - just not as sentimental or heart-felt as the first.",Null,0,1,11 October 2002
Apollo 13," Superbly Done
","This is so superbly professional - really a wonder by all involved. Like others who wrote comments, I do recall the events - I was in 9th grade - but (again like others), the suspense is still so taut, so thrilling.
To compliment those involved means mentioning everyone in the credits. I particularly liked Gary Sinise and Bill Paxton but everyone impressed me.
There are so many ways this movie could have been done wrong - too much pathos, too much technological discussion, too little sense of what it was like down in Houston as they tried to work on the problems. The movie avoids all these wrong paths. In fact, I think showing the way Houston was handling the problems was the most unusual and wonderful thing about the movie.
I also compliment the studio - imagine the temptation to do it at FAR less cost by showing it all from only the astronauts' perspective - a three actor movie with only a spacecraft to pay for. Thanks for not doing it that way.
I just loved it. It's the kind of thing a big Hollywood studio can finance - and superb top echelon pros can do so excellently - and in truth, no one else.",Null,0,0,28 August 2002
The Great Escape," Wonderful
","There are few adventure stories as great as this. The movie never flags - it uses its wonderfully large cast to perfect effect - everyone will have his favorite characters - the colors, the music, the sense of a wonderful adventure is just magnetic.It is interesting to think of how VERY different this movie could have been in different screenwriters and directors' hands. It is easy to imagine a very dark movie about an escape plan for 250 spoiled so that it involved only 76, and of the 76, 60 massacred and only a very few escaping - a story of frustration, of man's hopes destroyed, of the darkness of life. It would be interesting to see such a version - perhaps something like The Piano or Schindler's List.Instead somehow, the movie makes the viewer feel GREAT - vibrant, happy, enthusiastic, excited! It's remarkable that this story could be made to do this - I think much is due to the energy of a large group working with such dedication and teamwork, much is due to the wonderful music, much is due to the very attractiveness of the actors themselves.For me, there is something terribly appealing about the David McCallum character, Ashley-Pitt - his sacrifice to save the leader (and thus the entire operation), his looks, his manner. And something very touching about the Garner-Pleasance characters operating in tandem. Attenborough is himself properly subdued, authoritative, commanding - and Jackson is an excellent sidekick.I've always liked James Donald very much in everything - particularly as the conscience of The Bridge on the river Kwai - he's in the same form here.If you have heard the term, the 'Anglosphere' in recent years, one can see a vivid illustration of it here - the Australian-American-English-Scottish team working perfectly - with the same sense of values to be pursued and preserved, the same sense of humor, dedication.This is just wonderful for anyone - but perhaps particularly for men since there aren't any women in it at all!",9,9,13,18 August 2005
