Source Code," Rather predictable, but still surprisingly good!
","It's not a high sci-fi, it's not a thriller, more of a drama, actually. Like most people, I liked Jake Gyllenhaal from Donnie Darko and I've been following his career (as well as his talented sister's) since. Well, it's definitely way better than Prince of Persia blockbuster, I'd tell you.The thing is, that despite quite predictable twists and turns of the plot and some pieces of bad acting (Michelle Monaghan was plain dull), there's a good camera work with carefully selected angles and lighting, JG and, of course, Vera Farmiga do their best and create great characters, music is OK and... all in all, it just leaves the right aftertaste.Good flick, most probably because it is not grim. It was easy to go either to heroic stupidity of most Tom Cruise' movies or dark thriller like Pandorum. 'Source Code' stayed on the edge, balancing - and it was very good.And no, don't you dare to spoil it with a sequel.",8,1,2,4 August 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," Pretty good adaptation of pretty lousy book
","Yeah, I know - I'am a guy who actually read the book - fat lazy Russian who's even further from the fashion world than Anne Hathaway's character at the beginning. The only excuse - it was my wife's, and it was dull. But as for the film - it has one thing book haven't got, one and only Miranda - Meryl Streep. Her performance boosts this otherwise walk- through movie from 5 to 8 stars in my opinion. If you want a flick on fashion - go see Altman's 'Prêt-à-Porter', which is brilliant, actually. But if you want to see the Dragon Lady herself - look nowhere else. She's just like Al Pacino in 'Devil's Advocate' - charismatic, stylish and... complete.",8,1,1,23 November 2008
Iron Man," Raw fun
","Taking baby steps on my fourth decade of life I'm no longer a comic kid or comic adaptation fun - yeah, Sin City has it's moments, two latest Batman titles are OK in whole (with some drawbacks - and some sparks like Ledger, God rest his soul), but none of these films got at least 4 out of 5 on my scale.Beautifully mastered by director and camera-men, it shines. Robert Downey Jr. and Ms. Paltrow are so much in place and their acting (with a lot of humorous touches) is great. Jeff Bridges looks cool despite shaved head and pepper'n'salt beard. And all in all, it's a bright story which you can safely let your kid watch, not worrying about excess of violence pouring from the screen. This movie, somehow, is not about action for me - it's like, as I said, raw fun.Definitely recommended even if you got your degree already.",9,2,4,8 September 2008
