Ford v Ferrari," Movie about racing cars great for people that don't like racing cars
",Great combination of the small man's human drama and the pure octane racing is what makes this movie very likable even in between people that are not fond of racing sports.Christian Bale delivering again with yet another superb performance and exceptional picture with academy awards for best sound and film editing are the main reasons that this movie is of such a high value.,9,2,3,18 April 2020
