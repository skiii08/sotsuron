The Avengers," Totally Avenging !!
","This Movie is now released in Egypt i just found out and decided to go watch this blockbuster as a big fan of Marvel Movies This a very successful blockbuster first of all you find the bond between these characters and how each of them has his way of dealing with the big event the actors played the characters perfectly each of them the old ones who are used to the characters such as Robert Downey and Chris Evans , and Hemsworth and of course Samuel L Jackson they know the characters well they are the real characters on the big screen Also the new actors especially Mark Rufalo was a perfect choice for the Hulk which is considered very special in this movie and i can say he is my favourite !! you will really like him Seeing this interaction between these characters didn't feel awkward at all they where very convincing showing up and teaming up together with their different backgrounds and powers and directions it was a hell of a team up and cant wait to see them together again :) the plot is great with action all the time and lots of humor in different ways its so funny having these characters having some fun as normal characters and my 2nd favourite after hulk is black widow with a great acting from Scarlett and also loki was a hell of a villain chapeau for joss whedon the director for how he dealt with this bunch of superheroes and make them flow together perfectly I'd see this movie again and again",9,3,8,2 May 2012
