The Ring," Not much of a movie...
","I started watching movie thinking it would be scary. But lo and behold! It was not very good. All the deeper meaning people give to this movie I just did not see at all.This movie felt like one big mystery that took too long to figure out. Well, at least this mystery did not have a Hercule Poirot ending where everything just kind of clicks and he makes a big long speech. What I did like, though, were Samara and Aiden. Their creepiness was just that: creepy.

The Matrix," Great Movie, Great Effects...
","An excellently executed movie; possibly the only Keanu Reeves film I thouroughly enjoyed. There was so much philosophy involved it makes perfect sense why Alice in Wonderland was so often mention.The Special effects in this movie were awe inspiring. My favorite was not the bullet time, but the spoon bending. When the spoon bends the reflection it shows distorts. So much detail within this movie.My Rating: ***",7,0,1,12 September 2003
