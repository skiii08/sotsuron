The Blair Witch Project," Buffs vs. Afficionados: A Blair Witch Defense
","A horror movie with less than an ounce of visible blood, where we never see or even learn beyond doubt what the 'killer' is, and no teenage sex-kitten gets naked. That this movie has suffered vociferous opposition hardly surprises me. The simple fact is, it's extremely good, and the horror-movie industry will hardly suffer quality without a fight. Friends, the whole problem is that there are two species of us who watch horror movies. There are horror 'buffs', who seek all the wrong things in movies. Gore, nudity, and triteness are the hallmark of the horror buff's tastes. They feel that 'horror' comes from making an audience jump, as if the movie-maker's art were as simple as a well-timed M-80 in a quiet classroom, and prize 'fun' over shivers. Then there are those other, rarer fans, the true horror 'afficionados'. We are the audience who, for whatever reason, enjoy being scared. Of a higher stripe than your rank-and-file 'buff', we look for a movie to be creepy, disturbing, unsettling. We seek a smarter approach. Not that it must always be subtle; I have little doubt that The Exorcist approaches the top of most 'afficionado's' lists. But, friends, there is true horror here, as opposed to your common slasher, which is targeted to audiences possessing the human sensitivity of a tombstone. The Blair Witch is the afficionado's dream. It achieves a level of absolute verisimilitude that makes suspension of disbelief almost *too* easy. By presenting itself as an 'artifact', it takes itself out of the Land of Make Believe and intrudes itself (delightfully) into the viewer's world. The much-bemoaned dialogue is unsettling because it's *not* movie-dialogue at all; it's actually the way people in the really-for-real world speak. The piles of stone and strange twists in the trees are never really explained, nor should they be; we don't know what they are, but they appear tantalizingly realistic, mysterious and yet perfectly plausible; you could easily imagine that the whatever-is-out-there might leave signs exactly like that. And those wierd things in the branches do very much seem like they have a kind of wierd internal logic, like they *should* mean something. If it's never revealed, well, that's the magic of tease and misdirection, two of the most powerful weapons in the *real* horror-movie's arsenal. I'll concede, the movie was a fluke, and its gimmick can probably never be reproduced well without lapsing into imitation. But, to my mind, this what seperates 'us' from 'them'. If the Blair Witch scared the livin' bejesus out of you, you have the imaginative engagement necessary for appreciation of the world's finest horror-movies. If not... go rent Freddy vs. Jason, little horror 'buff'.",8,0,1,4 March 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Astoundingly Overrated
","The original review I had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over-harsh, so I'll preface with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no-one's really focusing on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie 'based' on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow', but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, 'witchcraft' meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship 'an'-it-harm-none' approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the British Invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to James Frazer's 'The Golden Bough', if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the Sleepy Hollow legend is shattered. So we wind up with a totally different story altogether. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us in advance. Also, I wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. And he might as well have dropped the Irving pretensions altogether. And, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellowing. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant her to be a blonde.",4,19,35,6 April 2004
Titanic," Is it over yet...?
","Titanic would have made for a perfectly acceptable hour-and-a-half film. The set design and costuming - all the period details, really - were fantastic, and the plot, albeit formulaic, at least held to Hollywood's general standard of mediocrity, and no worse than that. But where is it written that the length of a movie has to be relatively commeasurate to the vessel on which it is set? What this movie needed was a good editing - preferably by an editor armed with a chainsaw. Instead of settling for a passable 5-star, yea, even enjoyable 6-star historical romance, they shot for the moon - and produced an exercise in tedium and self-indulgence. I find it most noteworthy for the fact that it is the only movie in film history that ever managed to make me root for an iceberg. An unusual sensation, and no mean feat.",3,2,4,6 April 2004
