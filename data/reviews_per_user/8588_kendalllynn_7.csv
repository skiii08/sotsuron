Casablanca," casablanca review
","Casablanca seems to be one of those films you've always heard about but don't really know why. It's a household movie title, while many people may have never even seen it. This movie is definitely one to watch though. The way this movie was able to bring real world issues to the movie screen and turn it into a movie full of different genres is incredible. Between the tragic love stories and mysterious plans of the main character this film was definitely meant to be a classic. Director Michael Curtiz's vision for this film was to bring the real world issue surrounding Nazi France was brought forth very will. The use of lighting in this movie was really key to making it what it was. There were uses of silhouette, darkness in certain places, and the lighting of key characters to explain the great importance of different scenes and or characters. Overall this movie is on of those classics that is a must watch. As well as one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and find new things every time.",Null,0,1,15 March 2015
Taxi Driver," review
","Taxi driver, directed by Martin Scorsese tells the story of a Vietnam vet. With a war as controversial as that one to begin with this movie was bound to be a hit. The incorporation of PTSD within the vet's violent urges is a beautiful addition to a movie such as this one. Robert Di Niro was an excellent choice in the decision of the actors. The only real complaint about this movie is the plot is not as exciting as it could have been. It's very A-B-C. One thing leads to another which leads to the climax and the ending. The dark lighting in many scenes really serves the purpose of what was happening within the main character. These types of filming styles were very big during this time and allowed for many people to connect to a story line in a different way than the obvious.",Null,0,1,29 April 2015
Annie Hall," review
","Annie Hall is a such a different type of movie. The entire layout of the movie is so unforgettable. Woody Allen, a household name for movie directors appears as the main character as well. The way he interrupts and breaks the fourth wall is comedic, as well as it doesn't completely take away form the movie. He continuously breaks the fourth walls in ways I've never seen. If he has a flashback, the present him is interacting in the flashback, he points out otherwise unnoticed things, and he still narrates it. the story line is also a different kind too. the dialogue in this film is so casual and common sounding that it's like we're really there feeling what he is feeling.",Null,0,0,3 May 2015
The Graduate," review
","This may just be one of my favorite old time movies. The story line is incredible and has never been done (to my knowledge) like this one has. The use of comedy is genius and there really aren't ant dull moments. The issues that deal with real emotions of someone who doesn't know what to do with themselves once they graduate college is too real. There are plenty of movies about graduating high school, but not too many about college. The long takes, and lighting in this film also serve great added qualities to this movie. This movie is so different, and has something for everyone. Mike Nichols has an excellent eye for detail. His use of camera angles, and lighting (or lack of) in certain scenes really shows the emotions of some of the characters through a camera lens.",Null,0,0,29 April 2015
Singin' in the Rain," review
","Singin' in the Rain directed by Gene Kelley in 1952 was the begging of the 'musical' era in film. The idea that sound was almost never used in film until it was found possible in the 30's is hilarious to us now. However, when musicals came about it became a way to make a story flow in a different way. The way they show the struggle of turning into sound through music is both iconic and brilliant. The script to this movie is full of comedy, romance, and of course song. Now that the film industry was really defining itself this is a wonderful example of just how far the film industry had come. The wide angled camera shots are also a key component to this movie. Being able to see so much really emphasizes the movies' meaning",Null,0,1,15 April 2015
Pulp Fiction," review
","Pulp Fiction is just one of those movies that you always hear about but maybe have never seen. This movie is so different and interesting, director Quentin Tarantino really made a breakthrough film with this one. the camera angles were a really big appeal to me when watching this movie. The over the shoulder shots, as well as camera shots that were point of view shots, were very interesting. The camera was often angled down low and tilted slightly in many scenes which added a cool twist to the average eye level filming we see. The diverse cast of so many well known actors worked so well together to create a film as interesting and different as this one.",Null,0,1,3 May 2015
Psycho," review of psycho
","Psycho is truly a great example of the ending of 'classic Hollywood.' Director, Alfred Hitchcock is now a household name. This horror film was the begging for a new generation of movie types and movie goers. In an attempt to not make the movie too graphic the camera angles were mostly looking right at a characters face, relying on their acting to key the viewer into what is going on. The director also doesn't really use too many dim lights in the scenes where the most horrific things take place. This is an odd difference to the typical horror film we are used to seeing. However i do not feel that this in anyway took away the overall feel of the movie, and the horror scenes within.",Null,0,1,15 April 2015
