50 First Dates," I *love* it. Really.
","First of all, this movie is one of my absolute all-time favourites. The first time I saw it, I cried like a baby at the end, and continued to do so for the best part of an hour afterward. I was watching it alone, on DVD, so I was able to fully let go, completely releasing myself into those blissful waves of emotion. And yes, I do cry in movies now and then. But never like this.50 First Dates is a synergy of many elements coming together: plot, themes, characters, humour, pathos, music, acting, etcetera, to create something that is entertaining, fresh, beautiful and real. The humour is less inane than you often get from Adam Sandler and his mates, and there is more genuine fun. But where the film really shines for me is that the movie is entirely about relationships, and there are so many of them ... Lucy with her father (Marlin) and brother (Doug), Nick and Sue at the diner, Henry and Ula, Ula with his kids, Henry with the aquarium animals, and of course Alexa mixes things up.Okay, so the primary plot device, Lucy's memory problem, may not be realistic ... but that doesn't seem to matter. The movie makers have taken that idea and created from it an original story which is both light-hearted and poignant. The writing, casting, direction and acting are all excellent. Ignore the posters, which were terrible, and don't let the name of the movie put you off either. Just see it.",10,1,1,14 August 2014
About Time," Another Richard Curtis masterpiece
","How good is Richard Curtis? In my book, he is pure genius! He inspires me to be a better person.His first masterpiece, Four Weddings and A Funeral, is a roller-coaster ride of comedy and tragedy, packed with outlandish characters and witty lines, but most of all, fun. His second masterpiece, Love Actually, is another magical roller-coaster, but with more emphasis on the theme than on the humour. About Time continues this progression, and it is not a comedy at all, but a wonderful, positive drama about humanity, family, and love; in particular, the love between a father and a son.This is a thoroughly beautiful and intensely moving film. I cried my eyes out throughout the last ten minutes. I think it moved me so much partly because Tim, the lead character, faces many of the same life experiences and choices as I have, and learns lessons with which I can identify. The film is firmly grounded in reality, not fantasy, and how refreshing is that! And the plot is totally original, you can't guess what's about to happen.Domhnall Gleeson is perfect in the leading role, and Bill Nighy is just so wonderfully honest in his role of Dad. The film belongs to these two. My only gripe is that Margot Robbie had such a small part - she is a damn firecracker!",9,5,9,25 February 2014
Notting Hill," Lots of heart, but not perfect
","An entertaining and touching film about relationships by master writer Richard Curtis. In particular, the film explores how regular people relate to big celebrities, poorly for the most part, and the isolation and even alienation which a celebrity might feel as a result.Julia Roberts is superb, bringing bucketloads of emotion and vulnerability to her portrayal of the movie star, Anna. The supporting cast are wonderful too. Rhys Ifans is so funny and so perfect in his role of William's flatmate, Spike, that he almost steals the show. But the scenes with William's family are the true heart of the movie, full of quirkiness, honesty, tragedy and unconditional love.And yet, there is something missing. This film doesn't approach perfection, as Four Weddings and Love Actually do. What is wrong? What holds this film back? Is Hugh Grant too reserved in the role of William? Is he in fact playing William, or just being Hugh Grant? I understand why he was cast in that role, but I'm not sure he was the right choice. Are we fully convinced that a big star could be as down-to-earth as Anna? But my main gripe is that the climax and conclusion of the film are too contrived (the press conference at the Savoy) and too rushed. William never properly declares his love for Anna. All he says is 'I made a mistake' turning you down, she smiles and says she'll stay indefinitely, then we get visuals of a wedding and sitting together on a park bench with a baby bump. The resolution of their relationship deserved more attention.I generally prefer British movies over Hollywood ones, but in this case I prefer the book store romance You've Got Mail from the previous year, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.",7,0,0,7 March 2018
Cast Away," A masterpiece
","Entertaining, moving and powerful. A masterpiece of cinema. Few actors could carry a movie solo, as Tom Hanks essentially does here. We feel as if we are right there on the island with him, feeling the initial panic, the frustrations of getting food and making fire, counting the days, battling the loneliness, struggling to keep it together. And the emergency dental procedure, ow!The length and pacing of the movie suits the subject matter brilliantly. Time passes slowly when you're marooned. So many movies rush their ending, leaving the climax right to the end, but this one does not, with over 30 minutes of it occurring after the rescue. The denouement deals with Chuck trying to find his place in society again, and the resolution of his relationship with Kelly.",9,3,4,4 February 2014
Pride & Prejudice," Refreshing and accessible for those who know the story
","As a lover of this story, both in its original book form and the 1995 BBC TV production which so faithfully stuck to the book, I initially found the many surprises contained in this film somewhat off-putting. But my reaction to a second viewing was decidedly positive. Love the pithy new lines in the script, the unique slants on the characters, and the whole thing feels more accessible and based in reality than the older production. My main complaint is that it does feel abbreviated; those unfamiliar with the story may even find it incoherent.Several characters are substantially better cast and portrayed in this film than the 1995 production. Judi Dench has the presence we expect of Lady Catherine, and Rosamund Pike is drop-dead-gorgeous as we imagine Jane. In 1995, Julia Sawalha isn't silly enough as Lydia, and Mrs Bennett, Mr Collins and Miss Bingley are too over-the-top. Darcy and Elizabeth are great in both productions, although quite different. Firth's Darcy is handsome and aristocratic, but Macfayden's is younger, less aloof and less sure of himself. Ehle is a little too old as Elizabeth; Knightley is just right. I like both Mr Bennetts, but Sutherland brings some beautiful new nuances.",8,0,2,3 February 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," It's a con
","Didn't live up to the hype. Yes, Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a great performance, and yes, we get transported into a zone of debauchery and obscenity which we would never have imagined could really exist. But for what purpose?In some ways this is a non-story. Jordan Belfort cheats a lot of people, gets filthy rich, then gets caught. But he doesn't change ... at least he's not portrayed in the film as regretting any of his actions. My point is that the main character doesn't *develop*, so it's a non-story. Which I guess proves that the guy is a good salesman, considering how many copies of the non-story of his life that he's sold.So although the movie works on the voyeuristic level, and to some extent the comedic level, it's fairly base entertainment. It's certainly not a movie which appeals to the mind or the heart. The one highlight is an incredible couple of scenes towards the end when Jordan and Donnie are off their faces: Jordan has to get to his car and drive it even though he can't walk, then he fights Donnie for the telephone.I would have rated the film lower, but for the good work of DiCaprio, the inclusion of Margot Robbie, and her good work also.",4,3,5,3 March 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," A pleasant surprise
","I haven't read the books, and didn't see this film at the cinema, but I am aware of the the hype surrounding both and the debates they raised in the media. Before watching the DVD I read through some user reviews here on IMDb, and was curious to see so many one-star reviews.I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The heart of the movie is a relationship, a love story, between a troubled, controlling billionaire and an ordinary, romantic young lady. It's certainly not the typical love story you get from Hollywood, and there is plenty of tragedy mixed with it. But I was drawn into the story, and left wanting more. It's only the first part of the story, after all.The subject matter is difficult, but the story is told with sensitivity and restraint. Some people were complaining that they felt no affinity with Mr Grey, but that is partly the point, he is a damaged person and he is a difficult man to understand and to know. For the audience to feel this, as Anastasia is feeling it, is an intentional and important part of the storytelling. But we do see enough of his inner battle, his fight to change, and Anastasia's fight to reach him, to develop an attachment to the characters. We can hope that he is not damaged beyond repair.The directing, acting and cinematography were all great. The score is fantastic, tantalising and foreboding at the same time. Yes, there are elements in the plot which are not high on the believability stakes, but that's a criticism you could level at almost any film. It's a unique film that's hard to classify. See it with an open mind (which will be easier if you watch it alone), and you'll be challenged and entertained.",6,0,2,28 May 2015
Flight," It's not about a plane crash
","Okay, so my preconceived notions of what this film was about turned out to be totally incorrect. The movie does include a plane crash, but the central story is Captain Whip Whitaker's struggle with alcohol addiction. Overall it was good thought-provoking entertainment, thematically dark but interesting, and I always love watching Denzel Washington work. I disagree with some comments that it was too long; proper character development takes time.My main complaints are that the film stretches credibility in several areas. The idea that an alcoholic could be a successful airline pilot is scary, although I suppose not impossible. The idea that any pilot could successfully crash-land an aircraft following a mechanical failure of the type depicted in the film is just nonsense, with or without the inversion manoeuvre. The NTSB investigation being pressured by lawyers? I doubt it. The NTSB making statements on causes at a public hearing? Nope. But perhaps the biggest credibility gap is that Whitaker decides to come clean part-way through the hearing ... it's a dramatic device, but too predictable. I would like to know the alternative endings which the team considered when planning the film, because I suspect I would have chosen a different one. Part of the reason I chose to watch the film was Robert Zemeckis, director, but this is not one of his best.",6,0,0,6 February 2014
