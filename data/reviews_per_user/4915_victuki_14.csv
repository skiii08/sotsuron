The Equalizer," True Justice
","Based on a TV show from the 80's but with some changes (McCall was a British SAS ex-operative, not an American), comes this remake directed by Antoine Fuqua (Olympus Has Fallen, 2013). Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, a former CIA operative that is morally compelled to go back into action to help a lady in distress. Though it looks like 'The A-Team', it is surprisingly deep in terms of character motivation, and those characters are way better performed than the standard blockbuster movies.Fuqua is reunited with Washington after 'Training' Day, (2001), the film that got him an Oscar award as best leading actor. Fuqua has made some major blockbusters but all of them very well crafted and full of deep-layered characters that reach you ('King Arthur', 2004) or 'Shooter' (2007), both blockbusters that were also critically acclaimed.He usually gets to work with solid cast, and this time is no different: Chloë Grace Moretz (Dark Shadows, 2012) or Marton Csokas (Lord of the Rings, 2001-2003) or 'The Bourne Supremacy' (2004) support Washington, and they both deliver (Csokas is great as a crazy Russian operative).Bottom line, a great action movie, the kind you watch all over again every time is on TV. Let's not kid ourselves, if we had to choose a film to take with us to an isolated island, we would not choose a David Lynch or a Hitchcock film, but something like this or the Lethal Weapon saga. 'Nuff said.",7,0,2,23 October 2014
Interstellar," The Ultimate Journey
","I won't be objective about this. I think Nolan saved modern filmmaking from mediocrity. He has shown that being epic is an option, whether you succeed or not (there is a blunder around him). It is a way of expression, and at the end of the day it is all about quality, plain and simple.Interstellar is an example, a story with such a scope it literally transcends space and time. Mankind is in a delicate situation. Environment issues and gravitational anomalies threat the very existence of the human race. The only salvation might be a bold mission through a wormhole near Saturn, and investigate what is beyond. The ultimate journey, an interstellar one...As usual, Nolan works with top-notch pros, a highly awarded cast, including McConaughey, Caine, Hathaway and some surprising cameos. Wally Pfister, the usual D.O.P. of Nolan, was busy with his debut 'Trascendence' (2014), but Hans Zimmer repeats as the score master. And he makes it again, a glorious score, though it tends to copy the music from '2001: A Space Odissey' (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). It is not a perfect score as the one he wrote for 'Inception' (2010), but it works.As for the movie itself, there is just one thing I did not like. An entire section of the film could be cut out and would not really affect the rest of the story, and we are talking about forty minutes, but then again, it is an opinion and I am sure some fanatics will try to come after me carrying torches. Other than that, this is a story in which we find drama, thrill and stunning visuals (the design of the robots is amazing, they become characters, just like the rest of the cast). Science-fiction is based on actual scientific theories, from black holes, relativity etc. (even Dr. De Grasse Tyson would approve it). So Nolan is behind another 'tour de force' of excess, proof that to him, it is all or nothing.Nolan has been compared to Kubrick as they both shared a taste for breathtaking visuals, and also a passion for his projects, though with different approaches (Kubrick was far more unsociable). It is not for me to decide if that is true, but I know that with this film, Nolan proves himself to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Once again, as it happened with 'Inception'(2010), just trying to undertake such a task is enough to get an Oscar award. No matter if you have the tools and the resources, this is about having a vision and going for it. Another masterpiece of modern filmmaking.",9,3,9,7 November 2014
American Sniper," Gritty and Gripping
","Chris Kyle was the most lethal sniper in the U.S. military history. He apparently killed more than 250 Iraqui insurgents, though the Pentagon only credited him around 160, which nevertheless made him a legend of the U.S. Army. I started to read the book last year but stopped doing it since I first heard about the project. Eastwood and Cooper on board, that is promising. And of course they both deliver, and 'American Sniper' is dense and blunt, quite like a shot.Cooper plays Chris Kyle, the ultimate 'American': religious, patriot and uncompromising in his convictions. He is a noble and honest man regarding every aspect of his life, and that is something to respect. Cooper already played a soldier in 'The A-Team' remake (Joe Carnahan, 2010), and it seems that he showed great abilities in the military stunts, and showed interest in the work of the army. He bulked up 20 kg and went through a really tough training, including Navy SEAL sniper sessions. Sienna Miller plays his wife Taya, who suffered the effects of war on his husband, despite his strong belief and determination. Her unconditional love was a massive support for Kyle.Eastwood has made an intense and heartfelt film, one of his trademarks, absent shows and unnecessary politics or philosophy. This is obviously the classic 'American' patriotic film, but it differs from others in the approach of the man, who is an instrument to a purpose, yet a human being totally aware of what he does.Bottom line, this film is almost perfect in many aspects, and the only thing that does not hook me is how much it reminds me to 'The Hurt Locker' (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008). That was way more focused on the adrenaline addiction the main character had, but the behavior of both characters after tours seemed to me pretty alike.",8,92,162,10 January 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," Good Story and Performances
","Jean-Marc Vallée directed 'C.R.A.Z.Y.' in 2005, a family drama that became an instant cult movie. The performances, settings and music (there is a fantastic moment around Pink Floyd's 'Shine on Your Crazy Diamond') made this movie special, and left no one indifferent. So when I found out Vallée was the director of this project, I got a good feeling about it. In addition, Matthew McConaughey, who has completely changed his style in every aspect (Please watch 'True Detective' (Nic Pizzolato, 2014-) to know what I mean), a good cast and a story inspired by true events sounded really good. And it was an Oscar candidate already, so go figure. Matthew McConaughey is Ron Woodroof, an electrician and rodeo fanatic with a excessive and reckless sexual life. Eventually he contracts aids, a disease that back in that time was considered to be a homosexual-profile one. Without proper knowledge and treatments about it (it was still a new illness) he finds himself researching to extend his life, and by doing so he becomes a beacon of hope for many other people, whether affected by the same disease, like Rayon (great Jared Leto), or Dr. Eve, the doctor who treated Ron in the first place. This is a hero's journey, from the very hell to salvation, his own and many other's; this is a path of redemption, love and acceptance. The perception of life, every second of it, changes dramatically, and such story is worth telling every time. But I have to be honest here, and I can't stop wondering: Why is always this kind of movies the ones that get the Oscar? Again, as I said in the previous entry, I am not saying they do not deserve this or any other awards for this project. But I notice a tendency to be extreme melodramas the only ones to get this attention, and it bothers me. I like to think there are different stories, as good as these, or even better in some ways, so there is no need of dwelling on misery to tell a good story. As I said, kudos for the film, its great, but I feel that only for a change, films like 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'(Ben Stiller, 2013), or 'Amelie' (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001) are also amazing stories, unique and touching, but it seems that optimism is not as artistic as drama nowadays. A real shame, but in the meantime, I rather daydream...",7,1,1,27 August 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Masterpiece From Beginning to End
","Sometimes, if you want to know if certain films are worth watching, you have to rely on which cast is involved. Great actors are usually into great projects. This case is no different. The cast is outstanding, and the list is long, from F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Jude Law, the always brilliant Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and so on and so forth. And then Ralph Fiennes, complete king of the show, simply spectacular in every bit of it. Wes Anderson, who directed 'Life Aquatic'( 2004), or 'The Royal Tenenbaums' (2001) is back with this little big project. And it is so because it is an intimate story, yet embedded in a large scale game play, a massive project from an artistic point of view; every character and event is paramount in this little poem. This 'Chinese box' kind of filmmaking, a story within a story, is what Anderson uses to tell us this tale. It is a classic literary device, and like in literature, it might involve the same issue, namely the narrator reliability, (though in the film the veracity of the events is emphasized), so everything could be a wild imagination from the narrator, which may be even better for the purpose of the whole thing. I'm sticking with the latter, because at the end of the day, a good story is a good story, whether it is more or less believable, right? A writer (Jude Law) begins this tale, telling us how in his young days, he stayed in the decadent 'Grand Budapest Hotel', and met the owner, Mr. Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham), who will tell him how he acquired the hotel, back in the glorious days.What can we highlight in this movie? The cast is amazing, such a bunch of superstars, all of them inspired and enjoying the show. Photography is great, colors, lighting, everything...there is an important amount of detail in production, from the hotel itself in its different stages to the wardrobe, music, visuals and introduction of each chapter. The pace is pitch perfect, a seamless tale that even in a sequence of flashbacks keep the whole together, and so do the actors, follow the lead of Anderson in a way that every single character, every line is nailed, both in performance and rhythm. That is writing, in this case a screenplay, and definitively, that is filmmaking at its best. This is the best Anderson movie so far, is cohesive, compact, it is a exquisite piece of work, both in form and content, his masterpiece. Honestly, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a must-see, a film I strongly recommend not only because of its quality, but because it reminds us that there is always, always a story worth telling.",10,4,8,27 August 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Daydreaming and living
","In a previous entry, I remember writing about the Oscars and how dramas tend to be the winners, almost like an amendment. The fact that such a film is not even nominated is quite sad. This is a statement of what Hollywood considers to be worth awarding. Drama? Yes. Comedy? No way. This is a loose remake of the same film directed by Norman Z. Mcleod in 1947, and an instant classic I reckon.Walter Mitty is a honest, simple man, and yes...a bit dull. He has a good job in the Life magazine, follows a routine of hard work and little or no fun at all, and no social life whatsoever. But you know how things work, most times it's all or nothing: suddenly a new girl starts to work in his company, a company that is about to be closed, and he accidentally loses the cover photo for that last issue.That's the a new life for Walter, just another one, so to speak...This project was associated to some top-notch stars of the industry: Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard behind the camera, and Will Ferrell or Owen Wilson as stars. Finally, it was Stiller who did helm it. Known as a brilliant comedian, Stiller is also a good director (Tropic Thunder, 2008 is just epic). He leads this story about daydreaming, living and not being paralyzed by fear; when you face the unknown, and dare to do the impossible, you just realize that in almost every case, impossible is just a word. it might take a lifetime to come to that conclusion, or it might never comes.I remember that after watching it, I felt so alive, so happy. Because drama and misery cannot be the only leitmotif in filmmaking. Sometimes the way you face life is great enough to be the plot of a beautiful and touching story. This one is, and I insist that these kinds of movies are more and more rare nowadays. So watch it, enjoy it and live, not because you only live once, but because there is only one life to live. Trust me, it's not the same meaning.",10,1,1,27 October 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of a Cool Galaxy
","Marvel comics is the greatest comic books company of all time. They own the most famous characters (Spider-Man, Iron Man etc.) representing a pantheon of legends, most of them created by Stan Lee, who changed the history of comics forever. Good stories, characters with human features you could relate to, even though they were extremely powerful. All of this plus a good share of humor if possible (Spider-Man sarcasm is legendary) is the trademark of the Marvel empire. Now this empire has become a film empire, and given those treats, they have great material for decades. And I want to be there to see it... Abducted as a child in the late 80's, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is now a grown-up space pirate who calls himself 'Star-Lord'. When he steals an orb, he becomes a fugitive chased by demigods like Thanos, alien race Lords like Ronan and some other nice people around he will have to ally with. Chris Pratt is Quill, a not so cool captain as the Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) from Firefly (Joss Whedon, 2002-03), but with enough charisma to lead the party. Bradley Cooper is Rocket, a bad-ass raccoon with anger issues and Vin Diesel is Groot, a suave alien tree. The rest of the band is Zoe Saldana as Gamora, an assassin that deep down is a lovely lady and Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, a well-spoken goon. It is quite a fun cast to be honest. Like I said before, this is entertainment in Marvel fashion, action packed films, loads of fun, and as a bonus, an awesome soundtrack, which will cheer you up anytime. To be honest, mainstream tends to be vulgar, and abuse of CGI is a must nowadays, but not always. Sometimes, though, when you let go and just enjoy the ride, it's great, and much more if there is a good story, entertaining, not pretentious and impeccably made. That is pure entertainment, that is cinema.",8,1,4,27 August 2014
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Musical or Musiglam
","Plot: Hedwig, an kid from the RFA with some gender issues, finds only one way to escape from his country. Sex-change surgery, marry an American soldier and then grab his mother passport to get the hell out of there. Now in the USA, we will witness her story: girl meets boy, boy steals her songs to become a rock star...all of it through a great musical, or better said a 'musiglam'. Ludicrous, is it not? John Cameron Mitchell adapts his own Off-Broadway play into the big screen, directs and stars as Hedwig, in a movie full of colors, light and music. A film that became an instant classic, a cult low budget movie, and a reference in indie filmmaking at the beginning of this century. Stephen Trask plays the role of guitar player in Hedwig's band, and he is responsible for the whole soundtrack, a track list as solid as touching; what a perfect music for such a story.I remember watching this film around 2002 or 2003 in a nearby cinema, a 'Glam Night', films like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (Jim Sharman, 1975), 'Velvet Goldmine' (Todd Haynes, 1998) or this very film. I am not a fan of musicals, they seem to me a bit absurd, but when I watched this, I thought: 'well, if it's excessive, it better be ridiculously excessive'. And so it was, but not only that, it is a great film, a touching story and a wonderful soundtrack. Meet Hedwig, it is impossible not to enjoy her story.",8,0,1,23 October 2014
The Dark Knight," awesome film, pure modern cinema
","The Dark Knight is the best film of this year, that is for sure. It is hard just to highlight one of the many good things of it. The cast is fully committed to their roles, specially Bale, as a more mature Batman/Wayne. Freeman, Caine and Oldman, as expected, are not just supporting roles, but they have their own history within the whole picture. Regarding Heath Ledger, his performance is overwhelming. It is quite a pity he passed away, because his talent in this film could have increased so much; not only in a possible sequel, but in future projects. His joker, in the half part of the film, is pure and charismatic chaos, and his line about an unstoppable force of nature is superb.finally, the technical aspect of the movie is simply spectacular: the score is worth watching the movie, and the use of IMAX cameras in certain scenes result in a highly crafted film-making. I can only say that Th Dark Knight is pure cinema, and from this moment on I shall refer to Cristopher Nolan as Sir Cristopher. Thank you for teaching us the magic and pleasure of real film-making.",10,7,15,28 August 2008
Frank," Fake Head, True Filmmaking
","Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), a wanna-be musician whose songwriting is crappy at best, joins by chance a weird pop band, quite indie, quite insane. The leader, singer and songwriter is Frank, a charismatic front man who always wears a big fake head. A rather promising story I reckon... There are great actors on board, like Michael Fassbender, Maggie Gyllenhaal or Domnhall Gleeson, but music is the main character here. It is not a musical, it is more how music struggles to be business, or something artistic or even mystic.It is at this point that both Fassbender and Gyllenhaal nail it as tortured but gifted souls that create music, because let's not kid ourselves here, ordinary people don't usually create something like 'OK Computer' (Radiohead, 1997, EMI Records). Jon begins his own journey from being that normal person to someone that witness that artistic epiphany that we as fans can only enjoy. It is quite a way to describe the process of songwriting ( I will not keep talking about this since I am not a musician), but as far as filmmaking is concerned, this is indie at its best. Dense, compelling and let's say it, hipster, at least aesthetically; it is not that original, nor is it classical, it is more erratic, inspiring even...It seemed to me like those records that leave no impression on that first listening, but that in time tends to become the most appreciated song pieces in your mind.",8,0,1,15 December 2014
Inception," An Absolute masterpiece
","When I thought Nolan could not outshine himself, I watch 'Inception'. This is not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, but a journey to a place you don't want to leave. One hour after watching it I am not able to fully describe what I've seen, heard and felt. It's absolutely essential for your life to watch this movie. Once you watch it, you will experience pure genius from an author when trying perfection, and joy when you feel he made it. The cast, action, music, effects, plot and subtext are combined in a way most directors only can dream of. Nolan has proved, once again, that quality, intelligence and talent can also work in mainstream industry. From this moment on, most films will be boring, simple and not worth watching. That only happens when you reach pure happiness. Thank you, Mr. Nolan, culture and cinema are richer because of you, and so are our lives. If this man does not get an Oscar award, the world is definitely doomed to ignorance and therefore to an end.",10,6,14,7 August 2010
Lucy," Lucy and the brain potential
","The man behind 'Leon' (1994), Scarlett Johansson in kick-ass mode... Who wouldn't want to watch this film? But as usual, nothing is what it seems, and the question is: is that a bad thing or a good thing? It depends, whether you expect just another sci-fi action packed movie or, knowing old Besson, something else. In the same fashion that 'The Fifth Element' (1997), 'Lucy' is not so genre-tight, but it tends to expand, an inside out explosion. Some might like it or not, but the truth is that Luc Besson is a great filmmaker, and it seems he can make a very good movie anytime he wants to. Lucy (Johansson) is a tourist that finds herself in the middle of a drug dealing business and ends up being a mule. To make things even worse, the package she carries bursts inside her, and the consequences are as unexpected as they are cool. In just one day her brain capacity will reach its full potential, unfolding every secret the brain still hides from mankind. Scarlett Johansson (oh Scarlett...) is Lucy, and she turns from bimbo to super-heroine in half an hour, something Scarlett does easily, as well as showing us how with higher brain capacity comes some 'changes'. It is in those moments that she makes her best, though I am not objective here. What she did in 'Her' (Spike Jonze, 2013) was outstanding, and I am a crazy fan, I must confess. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman are just spectators, and we all just sit and enjoy the Scarlett show. 'Lucy' is sci-fi, yet it states that we only have access to 10% of our brain capacity, which has been debunked by several scientific studies. That would be unacceptable in most cases, but in this case it is not a big deal, since this film is not hard sci-fi; it is not a superpowers film nor a brain research film, but rather a film about our very existence and evolution. Quoting Pearl Jam: 'I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher (...) It's evolution, baby' ('Do the Evolution' from the album 'Yield', 1998, epic records).",7,6,14,27 August 2014
What We Do in the Shadows," Fun and fangs
","'The Unholy Masquerade' is a secret cult event, full of vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures that takes place in New Zealand. Only a few days before that, some vampires open the gates of their home for a documentary crew to follow their lives. Viago (Taika Waititi), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Petyr (Ben Fransham) and Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) are those vampires, and we shall see how they struggle with issues like being flatmates, doing the house chores and cope with modern day lifestyle; all of this is an overwhelming, funny and bloody adventure. Jemaine Clement is a well-known comedian from New Zealand, co-creator of 'Flight of the Concords' (2007-2009), and also known as the villain 'Boris the Animal' in the film 'Men in Black 3' (Barry Sonnenfeld, 2012). He and Taika Waititi, seen as Ryan Reynolds pal in 'Green Lantern' (Martin Campbell, 2011) direct this amazing and funny mockumentary. It is a fresh take on vampires, werewolves and else, who are out of time and out of place, misfits that are actually more human than those seen on more 'serious' incarnations. However, there is a possible hiccup here, and it is its that New Zealand scent, that mysterious something the country and culture still has. Once you get immersed into it, there is no way back, you love it. That happens with the humor as well, and I recommend you to watch this and then have your word about it. It might not be a mainstream comedy, but it is funny to dead (or living dead).",8,3,7,15 December 2014
Her," Just Fantastic
","The filmmaker behind movies like 'Being John Malkovich' (1999) or 'Adaptation' (2002) is back, four years after his last long feature film, 'Where the Wild Things Are' (2009). 'Her' is a beautiful, dense and mesmerizing movie, only different from mainstream tendencies in its own development. It is the work of a mature auteur, surprisingly accessible yet completely personal, and that is quite a statement nowadays.'Her' takes place in an aseptic near future, and narrates the story of Theodore, a lonely letter writer, divorced and trapped inside a routine that keeps him just half alive. Only his neighbors seem to have some kind of contact with him, as well as the receptionist of his job. Everything changes when he decides to buy a new and sophisticated Operative System and meets Samantha.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the melancholic writer Theodore, lonely and daydreamer. His looks, manners and specially his voice really fits into such a mellow character we relate to almost instantly. His is the portrait of a man in a near future society, crowded yet emotionally empty at the same time.Scarlet Johansson is Samantha, whose easy-going character lights up the life of Theodore, though theirs might be an impossible love. Johansson's voice is absolutely fantastic, so subtle and warm that elevates her status as an actress to those who still believe she is just a pretty face (and body) and their interaction is far more real and touching than most modern films.'Her' is pure American Cinema, dense and layered as only worth telling stories can be. This is the story of an impersonal society, to such extent that Theodore writes letter for other people who does not have time, patience or their own emotions, to do so. It embodies the failure of intimate human contact. Such change in human behavior seems an overreaction to some, but it is also true that some might say it is just an ongoing tendency. In this futuristic society, where human contact is every time less and less frequent, the story of Theodore and Samantha is more and more likely to happen.",9,1,3,27 August 2014
