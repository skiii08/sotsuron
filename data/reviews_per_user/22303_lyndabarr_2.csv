","I watched this film,thinking it was going to be another over the top gun ho American we can kick arse movie,how wrong i was ,the film was very moving,the actors made the movie come to life,it gave an insight on what it must of been like for the people on that plane,the passengers on that plane where terified the men who stormed the cockpit where normal hard working men and in them few minutes became hero's .you get so involved in the film,you want to be with the passengers till the end,when the plane does goes down,u feel a terrible sense of loss,like you lost one of your own on that fight. when the passengers start phoneing there family's it's heartbreaking, so well done to all involed,very moving.",10,1,3,24 June 2006
Paranormal Activity," waste of time
","Was i watching the same movie as every one else, put a camera in the hands of monkeys and i think i would have enjoyed watching that more than this load of tripe. I was waiting to be scared, but a few doors banging, and powdered footprints didn't do it for me, did I also mention, it is the most boring film I've ever watched, sorry but if you where scared of this load of rubbish you must be scared of your own shadow, please don't pay to see this, in fact don't watch it for free, truly awful. It is not on par with some of the really good ghost story,The The Changeling 1980 staring George C. Scott now that is a truly scary film, makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The Haunting 1960 another classic,these where good ghost story's, now people grab a camcorder and film any old rubbish and the sad thing is people enter into the hype they hear people saying its the scariest movie ever,don't watch it alone,i'd let my five year old granddaughter watch it, in fact Scooby Doo is scarier than this so called movie",1,3,6,2 December 2009
