","I wasn't really a Cash fan, and I haven't listened to his music much at all. I was asked to come to this movie with a friend about a week after it came out. It was one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. About a week later I went to see it again and saw things that I missed the first time. The collectors addition came out yesterday and I bought it. The movie was still playing this weekend. I have never seen a movie run so long before. Even if you are not a country music fan, or a fan of Johnny Cash I think you should give this movie a chance and rent it or buy it. I grew up close to where some of the movie was filmed and I was telling my mom about it. She lived in Caraway and near Dyess Colony during the same time Johnny Cash did. She met him as a child, she died before the movie came out onto to video so she never got a chance to see it. I think she would have liked it as much as I do.",10,0,0,1 March 2006
