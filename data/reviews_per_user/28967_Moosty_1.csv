Hereditary," Emotional thriller with great acting.
","Oh well... I like quality thrillers and horror movies, even though I don't get excited with the ghost / possession stories anymore having seen so many of them already. Therefore I was not expecting much before I sat down to watch Hereditary. But it got full control of me after some 5-10 minutes past. The accident scene was one of the most socking movie moments of all time for me. I almost cried and it took me a while until I recovered myself from its psychological effect. Then, it went on very well with the help of great acting skills of all leading actors. I would definitely vote 10/10 for the movie if it had not been for the last 10 - 15 minutes - the final scenes of the movie. It was such a cliche, third class horror movie ending. It was truly disappointing for me. I think this could have been one of the all-time classic thriller movies otherwise.I would like to emphasize once again the acting was superb. The young actor Alex Wolff was almost perfect. Toni Collette was magnificent. Even though she (unexpectedly) left early Milly Shapiro who portrayed the little girl of the family was also very impressive. I wish the end of the movie was better at least for their sake.",8,0,2,28 November 2018
