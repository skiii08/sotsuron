Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I can't say it any better than The previous comment
","Dear Mr. Lucas,Your trade war/embargo did not make any sense to those of us who you were making the movie for. Where was the thrill?  A pod race?  The whole movie should have been a race -- a race to save Naboo. What possessed you to create such colorless characters --  their clothes had more personality, perhaps the Queens more so. Jar Jar Binks insulted Jamacians everywhere, and Watto was a Jew.  Forget that.  It's nit picking. Why did Obi Wan have so little to do?  Why was Liam's  .... this can go one forever. Where was the GREAT ADVENTURE? You brought the characters to Tatoonin and they STAYYYED there forever.  Nothing moved forward.  It was all talk. The few action scenes played on without a whit of wonder.  Why are you directing the films?  I mean, look your damn resume, George. You're a writer and an imaginative one -- YOU ARE NOT A DIRECTOR. And lastly, why do you think The Empire Strikes Back was the best of the series?",Null,2,4,12 January 2001
A Star Is Born," Trash
","The first two versions outshine this rape of the original story line. When did 'A Star is Born' become all about Norman Maine? Why Cooper? Why isn't Gaga featured more than you??Are we sure she qualifies to be a Best Actress nominee? You're in it more than she is. Why? With regard to this story, no one cares about your character, just be an ass. But no, you wanted the audience to love you. Urination scene. Really? The Dog? Really. You just threw anything at the screen and hoped it would stick. Too bad you wasted the talent that is Lady Gaga!!And I thought Streisand's version was a complete insane rock-n-roll vanity production. No, Cooper bests Babs!!",1,3,6,20 February 2019
X-Men," You Don't have to Know the Comics
","I had no idea what the X-Men was.  And 10 minutes into the film we realized that didn't matter.  We rented it and instantly fell for it all.  Wonderfully directed, the acting superb, a compelling story line -- everything that makes a movie -- no matter it's genre, a GREAT MOVIE!  See it!......",Null,0,0,8 January 2001
Closer," Blah Blah Screw Blah Blah Hate Blah Blah Screw
","Nice for this time of year, huh? I love it when Americans embrace poor British plays and attempt to turn them into films. I just have to laugh.If I have to look at Jude Law, airbrushed to within an inch of his life, in anymore ads, I'm gonna boycott him completely. How many more failures is this man going to be allowed? There is nothing special about him besides the accent. Captain Idiot!! Barfie (alfie) and the dreaded Cold Mountain.This crappy cake was baked in the 90s using the 80s as icing.The whole affair is sad, the sex escapades downright insulting. I mean, come on. Jude and Clive have computer sex, and Clive doesn't know he's talking to another man. I am sorry I don't buy it. I didn't buy the storyline. We don't have other, perhaps better written stories to tell? It is not slick, chic or cool to make a movie about horrible people who will drop their pants or pull up their skirts. Note to Mike Nichols (Carnal Knowledge was fantastic for it's time) Your time is up, now. Certainly you've invested well and can retire to a small old folks home in Florida. Your last movie smelled to high heaven as well. (What Planet are you from) It also made absolutely no sense either.The days of humor derived from who wants to screw whom are gone, dead and with it -- the bitchy queens from the 70s. That's what it all felt like to me. Four old gay guys screwing each other to Sunday and back. I don't care if one of them is Julia Roberts and the other (the worst actress in Hollywood currently -- outside of Anna Nicole Smith) one is Nat Portman.If this is a pathetic comment on the human condition, it's message is misguided. I leave you with this -- how do you make a movie about sex without an ounce of sexiness, sensuality or allure. You don't! And if you try, you're British. Leave this for a bored Monday when you can clean your toilet while it plays.",2,2,4,3 December 2004
Bohemian Rhapsody," It was like a religious experience
","My lord what a wonderful movie. It struts and amuses and sings, gets into your heart and gets the audience fired up.Rami Malek becomes a legend and has the power to follow thru with a stunning performance. Best Actor nod, I'm thinking. The Band members, Brian, Roger and John were wonderfully performed. The cast worked well together.This movie for some unknown reason is getting at lot of flack from critics ... reminds me of the scene in the movie when 'Ray' doesn't want to play the song Bohemian Rhapsody because he doesn't get it!! I don't think the critics get it.We fans, we get it. We loved it and I'm goingg back again. See it in Imax format!",10,3,4,3 November 2018
Burn After Reading," Fluff, good fluff, but fluff none-the-less
","We kept looking for something more. Yes, of course we liked it. We laughed -- not out loud but we did laugh.To me it was more of a character study and yes I recommend it. Brad Pitt is at the top of the comedy gene pool, as is Frances and George. John was wonderful -- hell the entire cast was above and beyond. The directors/writers as always perfection.Having said all of this, I just think the movie shifted gears from the moment dumb-dumb got shot. Again this is not a bad thing. It just became something more than a goofy comedy and so we tried to find what that 'something more' was.We never found it. We so wanted Tilda to get her comeuppance. Foul b*tch that she was. David and J.K. were wonderful also.In the end we concluded that the movie purports that Americans are so self-absorbed, vain and self-centered that all we think about is what we think we are entitled to. And that amounts to four plastic surgeries --- which she gets, at the cost of death, government cover-ups and several lives destroyed.Now think of this. Is this the quintessential WOMAN movie. Well, look at it. All the women get what they want and the men end up with nothing. I'm just saying.",5,5,9,27 January 2009
Watchmen," It reminded me of a tea party Eric Cartman might host with Professor Chaos
","Watchmen A silly little tea party attended by the fanboy elite whose under nourished appetites are invited to dine on the cloned flesh of the superhero mythos.A witless spoof of a spoof witnessed by the socially retarded unemployed who hate the real world for not having not an ounce of magic or wonder left to exploit.A self-important love letter written by those who believe themselves to be the gods of art, mailed to themselves and opened with surprise and the pretense of modesty in a shower of self-congratulatory kisses.An orgy of vomit splattered on the central theme that little boys desire to be men, nay, supermen in a world that will ultimately cripple and destroy their hopes and dreams Â– created by men who are incapable of growing up.And so director Zack and scribe Alan sing conflicting songs but in the same key. 'Aren't I clever. I am better than the genre itself. Kiss me and worship me for being so pretentious. I rise above you all and spit on you because I'm clever. I'm clever! Look at me mommy, aren't I clever.' To put the matter plainly this movie is nothing more than man escaping from escapism and fails at its weak attempt.",1,43,83,16 March 2009
Pitch Black," PERFECT ENTERTAINMENT Sc-FI style
","I can imagine those who did not like this decidedly non-Hollywood movie, don't like surprises or non-formula movies.Leave it to the Aussies to better us, (i.e. Super Nova, 4directors, nine writers and a completet wash-out) Pitch Black iseverything a high adventure should be, but it is also a moralitytale. Kudo's to the writer for making a believeable eco-systemon this foreign planet and three cheers for some stellar actingfrom a cast of up and coming performers.  Special Effect (i.e.the eclipse, itself) were stunning. Be leary of any Sc-Fi fanwho doesn't like this fine film, because there's something elsegoing on in their head.

The Hills Have Eyes," Wow another Frenchman who thinks he understands Americana Horror
","What made Craven's original frightening was the mirror-like story line. The happy camper going family fought, loved, bickered and so on. The anti-social bad guys also fought, loved, bickered and so on. Did I say storyline. I'm sorry, there is no story. There wasn't a story in the first one either but there were scares and tension and it's odd that the director Aja directed another poor movie called High Tension and both were devoid of tension. Gore? Yes. Logic? None. When will film makers tackle the realities of people in peril? My answer . . . never. All the characters in this version behave as though they have never seen a horror film. All of them behave as if they were never taught the basics of survival. A) You don't split up. B) You don't walk back to the gas station and C) you don't follow the dogs into the hills. Furthermore, the trite explanation of the why the hill people are the way they are is so lame. Yea, right. Atomic testing. Abandoned town. Radiation. Yea, right. Okay. And I guess there is hope for us when the bomb is dropped. I mean the mutants in this movie survived insurmountable odds after the fallout. We can too! I don't know fellow horror fans, but I'm getting tired of torture being passed off for good horror films. Perhaps it's time to invent a new genre. Let horror return to real scares, thrills and tension. Let the sadists cum snuff film wanna-bes make 'Torment Films' rather than 'Horror Films'. Ripping flesh, gallons of blood, no character investment and dopey dialog, not to mention a poor French filmmaker re-inventing the word vapid.",2,7,15,13 March 2006
Over the Hedge," Well-written funny farce with moments of pure genius
","When the movie isn't making you smile, it's making you laugh out right. The voice talent is the best I have heard in a long string of CGI cartoons of late. Well cast, Shandling and Willis are stand outs but Hammy, voiced by superstar Steve Carell, steals the show.The feel of the entire movie is that of Warner Brother's classic Bugs and company flicks of the 40s. Unexpected funny moments that bloom into absurd (i.e. the skunk dousing the house, views from the planet and general wacky thoughts) visuals make this one easy to watch over and over again.Kudos to the segment on 'Humans obsession with food'. RJ explains how we pray to food, dress up like food and consume more than we need. Whichever writers came up with the idea deserves a raise.Lastly, I could watch or listen to Wanda Sykes read a toothpaste tube -- she's that good. Can't end this review without mentioning the self-parody of William Shatner's over dramatic performance as Ozzie. He is truly an American icon.Don't miss this one.",9,0,0,29 November 2006
Wanted," I wanted to like this film
","In some ways it was good.The volume, screeching, screaming -- what amounted to loud noise was a turn off.The constantly-in-motion camera made it hard to see what was happening. This trend in film making upsets me.The fairy dust of curved bullets and leaping a hundred feet and crashing through plate glass easily and more or less dancing in the air wore out its welcome early in the movie.I was worried that there was too little of a story line which meant they would have to stoop to some trick or a weird twist. Major twist, we come to find out. I didn't like it.Yes it was cartoon fun.Peanut butter rocks, the rats were funny but not plausible. Yes, no -- the movie is not suppose to be plausible, I understand. But the rat bombs were not plausible within the universe the film makers set up early on in the film. (so much work for a two second diversion) So he could be come a killing machine. I mean, he kills so many, just one guy. It got old after the first ten guys died at his hand) And when you don't think much of your story, you try to add a second twist, which came off as ... really bad. Did the film maker assume he could shove a large tube of nothing down our open throats without reprisal?? At 50 minutes, I was over it all. I missed not having a real story line. Set ups for a epic twist are so M. Nightshade.A cartoon, at best.",1,7,12,1 June 2009
Van Helsing," Poorly written Euro Trash by a Bad director
","Directed/Writer Stephen Sommers single-handedly destroys the established myths of the universal monsters.I will never watch another movie by him again.If you can't (as a fan) do justice to the trilogy of horror history, you are pathetic. Stephen Sommers is pathetic.Too much CGI. Too much action. Too loud. Too stupid.The biggest insult: The werewolf doesn't know he could have killed Dracula all along? Wasn't that obvious to everyone in the first five minutes of the film.The worst rendition of Dracula EVER: A sissy Dracula? who dances and struts with a pony tail and a barrette? I don't want my Dracula fey!!What was with Anna? She starts with this preposterous Romanian accent and LOSES it half way through the movie.PLOT? What plot? We're suppose to believe the three brides gave birth to thousands of mutant bats in sacks!!!????And now Sissy Drac needs the Frankenstein monster to animate them?? Loved the American accent on Frankenstein. What the hell!!Soooo -- Van Helsing works for the catholics? In an underground Church, with monks and priests designing James Bond weapons? And he's an angel (which was never fully explained to my satisfaction) an angel who will father Abraham Van Helsing? What??!!If any other studio had produced this -- I would have waved my hand and skipped the movie. Shame on you Universal!How many times did these poor heroes have to get knocked down, thrown around before anyone developed more than a dab of blood on the corner of their mouths. Why turn Van Helsing into a werewolf to kill Dracula when you already had a werewolf character who is related to Dracula? Shouldn't Anna's brother kill the vampire.And what is this crap that no one knows how to kill a VAMPIRE. SINCE WHEN!!Sommer's wasn't paying homage to these great characters, he thinks so high and mighty of himself that he wanted to create his own version, which sucked. DIDN'T ANYONE watch him, didn't anyone CARE for the preservation of HISTORY. Have we raised this generation to buy into what we are told to buy into? This sold tickets -- Sommer's will be back like a bad squeal. As bad as Mummy Part 2 was!!Once again, Sommer's, exhibits no class. He tosses crap at the screen and hopes something will stick.",4,1,2,26 October 2004
Jarhead," A warless war picture
","I don't know. I ordered a war movie but I got something else. I have never been to war but this movie made it appear dull and boring. I appreciate the 'getting into the heads' of the characters. The acting was flawless. Like everyone else has said the cinematography was outstanding. Director, as always, does a great job.Having said that, I found no arc to the story, and I am not sure the story was anything more than one soldier's perspective. It just seemed to be a random series of vignettes which relied heavily on homo erotic themes. Even the scene where the dude's wife screwed him over seemed to say 'women stink, stick with your man buddies'. That scene was shameless foreshadowing, by the way.Jake's Christmas performance, which frankly was like watching a gay stripper, seemed out of character to me. But Jesus, can that boy shake his ass or what (but it pulled me out of the film). Furthermore there seemed to be a whole lot of Jake flesh and man flesh in general. Not that there's anything wrong with hot nekked men, but I thought I was going to see a movie about war.",4,1,2,15 August 2008
Resident Evil," I made the mistake of reading's Anderson script
","Paul SW Anderson's script for resident Evil was wonderful and I rushed out to rent the movie. I was heart broken when certain things didn't make it into the final film.Overall good -- though not as gory or suspenseful as I thought it should be, and I am not a gory and action kind-of-guy either. Killing the Red Queen so early and not having the scene where she helps them find the secret passageway to safety while the beast is on their tails wasn't wise.  I missed the White Queen also. And the many references in the script regarding the Alice in Wonderland were reduced to a white rabbit and the Red Queen herself. She didn't even look in the garden to see the characters from the story (i.e. Mad Hatter etc.) And there was no chess board microchip.The film did seem disjointed -- probably because the Producers chopped up his film. I gather he didn't have final cut and it shows.  Spence and Alice also seemed to have had scenes removed. And JD and Rain's roles were reversed from the original script.I don't want to sound down -- I really liked the script, and the film and I will be looking for the game as well.",Null,0,0,20 April 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Now that was cheesy fun
","I took a few moments to read others comments and seriously there are some very disturbed people out there. So many of the points brought up (in the negative vein) seemed to be responding to the movie/series as though it was all very real.Which of course makes me laugh because this is a movie designed to separate 7.50 from your wallet. And all of you people did that. So they succeeded. Whether you liked the movie or not means nothing to them. They got your money. The smart thing would have been to stay home and refused to see a movie, that most of you said -- you knew was going to be bad in the first place --- but you went anyway and gave them your money and now you have buyers remorse and feel must lash out. And for as bad as you all thought the movie was, it made enough money to produce a sequel. (due out December 2007)I caught this on TV, two nights ago. Wow what fun. (perhaps I should tell you I am 47 years, not a know-it-all tweener or twenty-something moron.) So I am easier to please. A remarkably well told tale of a alien-Olympics, where predators hunt down aliens for a right of passage. I remember when Aliens first came out I was 17, we loved it and we love anything connected with that mythos.If you are not a self-appointed know-it-all, and you like aliens and 'hunt' movies you will like this for what it is, a b-grade stab at entertainment.

1941," I know ... I know ...
","... but I love this movie. This type of all-star comedy broadly plays out, getting crazier and crazier as the plot unravels, is a slice of bygone Hollywood.Think 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World!' 'The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming,' 'Cold Turkey' 'The Great Race!' And the godfather of them all 'Around the World in 80 Days' These films I saw as a kid at the local Drive-In called Route 66.Famous faces, dozens of cameos, broad humor and all presented with an innocence that longer exists in today's cinematic world.I am just asking you to view it once, Once, perhaps at Christmas, or because John Belushi is awesome or because there is a dance sequence that is so amazing, you might have to rewind and watch it twice!!",8,1,3,19 September 2017
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," I wanted more.
","I have kept my thoughts silent on the matter of this sequel for 4 years. I saw it again last night for the 20th time and felt the need to comment.Agreeing that books and films are total different animals, I'll move to ask: What was wrong with the plot in Critchon's popular sequel: The Lost World. It could have been adapted for the screen. Period. Instead, we are given a weak first reel which includes, the return of Tim, Lex and John H; poor exposition involving Ian's attempt to expose InGen; and the girlfriend setup.The second reel tried & failed to capture the intimate quality of its predecessor, which balanced the CGI effects in JP1. I liked Dr. Grant, and Ellie and the kids -- they were real. I cared about them. I did not care for Sarah Harding or Nick. Liked Eddie though. The kid I could have done without. Vince Vaugan supplied testesterone and nothing else. Eddie was an interesting character in the book. It was odd that they switched Eddie and Nick around. The biggest travesty was sending an army of men to the island, because we all knew they were nothing but Raptor Snacks. The scene where most of the cast gets killed in a flurry of tails, and tall grass was a very cheap way to dispatch the army guys. They served their purpose - so let's find the most economic way of getting rid of them. The center- piece of the 2nd reel was the Camper Over a Cliff (hanger) which featured more camp than camper. The glass cracking was just too much. Great suspense.For a movie about dinosaurs, JP2 felt dino empty. Did anyone expect people to believe the scene in which Raptors suddenly change from jumping and killing humans to stalking and attacking each other just so we can have a ten second thrill ride with Wonder Woman crashing, diving and finally falling to safety. It was dumb.To the third reel. Spielberg does Godzilla in San Diego with Ian and Harding going above the law for their convictions. Where was Nick? Why didn't the guards shoot them when they stole the junior dino? And folks, I can't buy into the fact -- that everyone on board the ship was killed without ever warning the coast that they were in trouble. How did T-Rex get his head through the small door of the ship's bridge to bite a crew member (leaving only a hand clutching the helm). Okay! OKAY! It's a movie. I understand. But I resent the smell of by-the-number formula. Koepp is brilliant, hands down.So I went with it. And yes, I love it too.Anyway I am going to JP3 Wednesday and I'm hoping for adventure and excitement, a little blood and some scares.",7,0,0,16 July 2001
2012," Best Disaster film of the new century.
","I rarely give a movie a 10.The trailers fool us. It's a heck of a lot more story than they lead us to believe or those nay-saying reviewers chomping on the bit to bad mouth the movie. But ya see I'm no real critic. I know what I like. And I like John Cusack, Amanda Peet & Woody Harrelson, they are wonderful and believable but it's Oliver Platt's dominance that is the centerpiece of the movie's heart. What makes us human? Oh, yea and the runaway limo,plane, Russian air bus, RV and total destruction of the world is pretty damn amazing too.Roland Emmerich you rock my world. Harald Kloser thanks for the heart.Best Disaster film of the new century.Smart move making John Cusack, the ordinary man caught up in extra-ordinary situations.Oh, and yea, Noah.

The Mist," What were they thinking!!! 10 reasons why this is a flop!
","I don't know where to begin with this train wreck. People were booing at the end. There were all of seven people in the theatre on Friday night at 8:00, by the end of the movie four had left. Four people (including me) booed. Is that pathetic or what! I didn't even see the others exit. So my experience was creepier than the movie itself.1) The casting of Drayton: All wrong. This man has no persona, a pretty boy at best. 2) The CGI What the heckers?!. I get better quality in Halo 3. Those tentacles. hahah! 3) Comical, but unintentional. It didn't have a sense of humor about itself. Too serious. 4) It was a stage play, not a movie. 5) Plot points were telegraphed minutes before they developed -- no surprises. 6) I just wasn't chilled or frightened just mildly bored. 7) Why do people try to make topical statements in horror films, just scare me. 8) I could have been doing my laundry. 9) The characters were soooo one dimensional. 10) I loved the novella. I've waited years for this. Color me disappointed.Wrapping up my two cents I'd like to something about the end. Oh, yes I hated it, but I think Frankie and the Suits made a timing error. I believe if this had been released during Halloween weekend, I might not have minded too much about the new ending. As it happens though, we as an audience invest two hours into these cardboard characters only to see them offed (stupidly) -- on Thanksgiving frigging Weekend with Christmas just around the corner. Bad Timing, dudes.What were they thinking!!!???addendum: 12-20-12. Saw it again. Hated it even more.",1,27,56,26 November 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Wow! What a fun night!
","This is the kind of movie that need not make a thin strand of sense. It is action for the sake of action. And if there's a moron out there who felt the plot was too light or character development was too weak -- well yea duh, you moron. This is an action film. This features the undead. This is for your entertainment. This is not going to make you think or ponder over anything. It's an action horror film.I really liked the first one. The whole concept, the 'evil corporation' the secret testing, the Hive. It was all like ...well... a game. 'Umbrella' is evil and you pit evil against tough people who you are rooting for. The Alice in Wonderland angle was outstanding. In the final shooting script there were even more references that were cut.Anyway, back to the sequel. It didn't even feel like a sequel -- it just felt like the continuing saga. The new chick, Jill Valentine, was awesome -- it was very much a woman empowerment movie. Epps was so funny. It all made sense to me on its own terms. It never tried to be anything it wasn't. So when's part three coming out? And you know what -- I'm in my mid 40s. Give me this kind of film over 'In the bedroom' or 'Mystic River' any day. Life is hard enough. Who the heck wants to see a drama about someone else problems.

The Mummy Returns," It's Okay but I would have liked a plot
","I am a big fan of the first movie and the genre itself but there were some undeniable problems with the Mummy returns. Way too long. Way too loud. The movie is set up so we move from set-piece to action scene without any reason. Great action scenes. I felt the wind in my hair but after 60 minutes of following our heroes,  I wanted a twist, a turn,  a surprise.  (Her past life was no surprise, the pigmies from hell are no twist) Movies like this are treasure hunts.  Each stop you make  you learn something! Each piece is another slice of the big picture. Like Indiana Jones, each piece of the puzzle must be earned. And lastly at the climax some new fact  adds/changes everything, (her fake death  was a cop-out) In fact, the movie was a cop-out. What did Sommers do?  Spend a weekend watching adventure films and piece together his favorites? I mean, it was like he threw everything at us. The balloon, the double decker bus, the reincarnated angle, the dead army, the mummy, his chick, the kid, the Flood, The bugs and the pigmies!!! This is all thrown sloppily at the screen in hopes viewers are so tired, they won't care.  And with 70 million at the box office, I really don't think anyone will care. So we can look forward to more mindless adventure films in the future.  Films like this one --simply put --- Have no Heart. ............................",Null,0,0,7 May 2001
The Last Samurai," A Fat Epic of Paramount Boredom
","As many others have pointed out, this movie is nothing more than Dances with Samurai -- it's the identical plot line. The sweeping vistas, the way too serious actors and the very decidedly 21-first century feel of Cruise's acting choices led the viewer down a familiar path to an expected conclusion culminating in a Braveheart battle that's just dripping in Kurosawa lore.Tommy's character development is executed in hyper-reality from drunken lout to honorable Japanese-speaking samurai in 60 seconds.What are the Samurai rebelling against?History's door is slammed shut, locked, barricaded and rewritten.And if Master and Commander, arguably a better film, never reached the coveted number one spot -- why should this trite film.Furthermore it pointedly ignores romance to the shock of including a widow/ Tommy possibility. I will not tell you the 'twist' of their all-too-brief sub plot. One gets the feeling it was added-on in the eleventh hour.And while we're on the subject, it is humorless to the point of distraction.
And lastly, who is this movie for?  Certainly not the kids who do not acknowledge any film that doesn't unfold in these hip, modern times (sic). Perhaps it is just for movie geeks. The holiday season seems a strange time to release what feels like a summer epic. Awwww. But there is genius behind the cinematography. So as a travelog I think it excells beyond any of their expectations. As a holiday offering -- no.",Null,10,19,5 December 2003
War of the Worlds," A mixed bag of tricks
","In the first fifteen minutes there was genuine terror and suspense. The activity in the sky, the ear-shattering thunder that isn't quite normal, the wind and the electronic gadgets all going haywire. I settled into my chair and waited for the explanation to unfold. But nothing really came through. We have a father and his children on the road as the world goes to war with a faceless fiend. The story didn't seem clear. We had bits and pieces of what was happening but not the whole big picture. Perhaps that was the intent. Like the main character (a Mr. Yahoo if ever there was one) perhaps we were meant to be in the dark too.If that is the case, then everything that is thrown at the characters is in turn thrown at us. Perhaps that is why some of the things Mr. Yahoo did made no sense. The small scene at the farm with Mr. Robbins and Mr. Yahoo really bothered me. Mr. Yahoo's ultimate action was a pox upon mankind. A telegraphed message implying that humanity was lost and returned to a more animalistic version of man. I didn't like that. I wanted them to bond.I guess, I wanted an honest story of man vs. alien -- not man against man. Again this might have been exactly what Mr. Spielberg wanted us to feel.Like the anti-hero, the movie had no narrative. We simply followed Mr. Yahoo as he met others who were as clueless as himself. Frightening moments were dumped in our laps but all of them seem to be out of traditional story-telling context. It was like a road picture with horrific visions, death and torture along the way until he was able to hand over his kids to his ex-wife.Certain elements were not given worthy explanations --period! The red weeds, falling bodies, blood-sucking tentacles and this complete social breakdown of humanity, communication etc. Furthermore, seeing the little creatures bouncing around the neighborhood felt wrong. In fact, when they appeared it pulled me out of the movie. From the farm scene to the end I was disconnected with the piece and ultimately unsatisfied with its odd storybook ending. So what? Boston remained untouched? Mr. Yahoo's son made it there by himself? The ex-wife and her family were all dressed up like they were going to church? They seemed relaxed and unaffected by the mass-turmoil. Huh?Was Mr. Spielberg telling us we as a people suck and have no redeeming qualities in the face of the destruction of our own civilization? I hope not.",4,2,3,23 August 2006

To rob him of that award was unforgivable. I'm just saying.From the first frame every moment of this film was pure Holmes, yes with a somewhat clearer picture of the mad genius we have never seen portrayed though Jeremy Brett was wonderful and will always be in my heart -- Downey nailed it for today's audiences. Jude Law flawless == best performance since A.I. Rachel MsAdams awesome, Kelly Riley too. Mark Strong rocked.If you miss this movie -- you fail!",10,1,3,6 January 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Meh
","1. It's not bad 2. It's too long 3. The central idea of God vs Man was not sufficiently explored 4. There's little plot 5. It's too dark 6. There's no humor 7. I never want to watch another scene depicting the death of Bruce's parents AGAIN 8. I never want to see villain Lex Luther (in any form) ever AGAIN 9. All the same old tropes are repeated10. Batman and Superman are soulless characters 11. Gollywood keeps remaking the same movies over and over AGAIN 12. Dream sequences added nothing to an already weak storyline In the end, this movie is really a two and a half hour trailer for the DC universe Go Wonder Woman!! Liked the idea of an aged Batman. Henry did not capture Clark Kent at all! Lois Lane is window dressing. Too many cameos that slowed the pace of the film.This may be the last superhero movie I watch for a while. Maybe I am jaded but Gollywood seems to repeating itself ... and only ... for the all-might buck!",5,12,25,24 March 2016
X2: X-Men United," The Template of a Four-Star Motion Picture!
","There is something innate about the characters created in these two movies.Something so real -- so human, that I ponder Romero's question: Who are the real evil bad guys? The brain eating zombies? Or the 'normal' people.For anyone who has felt 'different' than their peers, and who hasn't? X-Men United brings together a collection of rich personalities, each armed with their own M.O. and yet none of them come off as a stereotype. None of them are not real. None of them have been cut out of the typical cardboard character reservoir, Hollywood is known for. For every Kurt Wagner, for every Pyro Boy -- for every man and woman whose wanted to actually talk to the President of the United States, and say -- hey 'You're removed from the day to day reality of your country, dude!' This movie skillfully endears us to the struggle we've all been through -- the desire to be accepted for who we are, not what you think we are. The gambit of emotions delicately balanced here is a testament to Bryan Singer's genius as a film maker.",Null,0,0,13 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the Greatest Motion Picture Sagas Ever Filmed
","I was 17 years old, Godless and bored. I believed in nothing but work. Between a Saturday matinee and the evening performance of a play I was performing in, I caught Star Wars and my whole world changed.To me 'the force' is the single most important dogma out there, I knew it then -- I understand it now. Even Mr. G. Lucas couldn't alter my opinion with his 'strange' explanation of the force in that dreadful Episode One film. Mediclorins, indeed!!!The force is something between the rock and the land, between us and the universe. It is what we all are. Where we came from. Where we will end up. It is a mystery, an old one, awash with echos from the serials of 1940s.Luke pines for the kind of adventure, a seventeen year old boy, can only dream of. Han doesn't care about anyone cause no one cares about him, 'cept a Wookie. Leia is fighting for truth and freedom. Darth wants to oppress the entire universe. Ben longs for day 'The Chosen One' will show himself.These are basic character goals, something we as humans can relate to. Dreaming. Caring. Fighting. Longing. We believed in those characters, they spoke directly to our hearts. They were innocent. We were innocent.In 1977 we were all trying to make our way in the big universe. We all had a Darth in our lives. If you were lucky you had a best friend covering your back -- like Han, and a girl you liked but didn't get.  For the volumes of science fiction essay that Star Wars has inspired, I wonder if the basic, raw truth has ever come out. Using the guise of sci-fi / fantasy, Lucas tells a simple story of humanity. That's it. Pure. Simple. 'The little guy can over come the bad guys of the world even when the bad guy turns out to be your Dad'Star Wars tells us we are strong, we can over come. It's message to children with stars in their eyes, is to look toward the heavens and never fear -- you've got good on your side.The innocence of Star Wars carried a generation into reality.
As a footnote, back then I spent every cent on Star Wars toys. Being 17, I didn't open the packages and play with the products but I kept them until two years ago. On E-Bay I sold the entire collection from all three movies. Suffice to say, the proceeds were a mighty fine down payment on my house. In honor of Mr. Lucas, my study features, among other things, an original poster of the movie and the M. Falcon hanging above my deak in mid-flight.
To this day, I can find nothing wrong with the film., a film that caused me to 'look up' and see the future -- my future.",Null,0,1,13 May 2003
300," Hollywood's first big Gay epic movie
","Men in black bikinis. Sweat pouring off their pumped up bodies.Did film auteur David DeCoteau (Voodoo Academy, The Brotherhood and Wolves of Wall Street) have a hand in this creation?If American fan boys flock to this film, there may be other reasons why they spend all their time with their fan boy friends down in their parent's dark, deep basement. Maybe basement is the new word for closet! There must be some reason why girls their age are so interested in yaoi.The homo erotic tension left me gasping from testosterone more than a few times.What little story there is, Frankensteined from bipartisan history, could have easily been played out in a half-an-hour format on TV. For an epic film it lacks all that made Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and the like, epic films. Unless limb chopping has become elements of a good story and strutting/marching is now considered a sub-plot --- this film offers no frigging story line. There's a wicked queen, well, I guess he's supposed to the King of the Persians. Some pumped up gym rats who don't like the evil Queen. There's also a good wife and a bad politician. (Is there any other kind) (BTW: Bad guys are deformed. Good guys are half-naked and look like underwear models. I guess that's the new twist on pointing out who's good and who's bad. It used to be that bad guys wore black and good guys wore white, now it's who's deformed and who isn't)The cardboard characters spout off (I had such a hard time understanding Bulter's dialog, I gave up) cheesy lines and they all seem so disconnected from this ancient battle. The battle itself reminded me of the disco era when on any given night throngs of saps were clamoring, literally stepping over each other to gain entrance into some trendy nightclub. That is what the battle scenes looked like, only without the leg chopping, wild costumes, gayish grunts,sweat, muscles and the whole mano-a-mano atmosphere. Well now wait a minute, I do believe that's exactly what it looked like back then. Perhaps Miller lived in the village during the 70s. I don't know. The lowdown: 300 men (in black bikinis and spa robes) hold off a prissy horde numbering in the hundreds of thousands. That's it. So I ask: Was there nothing more compelling from a historical perspective, well, I know there was and Miller must have known that too. Lot's more, in fact, portions of the real Spartan history would have been more interesting than the end result of this film. Even if they didn't use 'what really happened', why didn't they come up with something more than a soap-opera sub-plot, I mean, the double crossing politician is so 80s. My final thought on this wreck of a film is, are we over Frank's Miller juvenile scripting yet. May we now move on to better story lines that are more than excuses to use 'gosh-gee-whiz' technology and creative blood-letting?No. I didn't like the CGI sets/backgrounds at all. When I choose to play a video game I accept cartoon graphics. When I plucking down 12 bucks to get in to a movie, I expect better.",1,62,110,8 March 2007
Tarzan," Very Enjoyable. Very Safe. Very Disney.
","I have been on this ride before.  I have seen these characters before.Nothing was new and you know, it doesn't always have to be. The minute I rented it -- I knew exactly what I was in for and there's nothing the matter with that.  Disney's Tarzan was smart, innocent and a joyful ride through farmilar territory.  Phil Collins music actually moved the story forward and in many instances provided sharp story telling. I've read what the others have said, and they may be right but not all of us crave major changes, some of us like the feel of an old, worn Disney blanket, a bowl of popcorn and a chance to laugh. Life's too short for great expectations..........................3",Null,0,0,22 September 2000
The Great Gatsby," I wanted to like it .... so bad, but ....
","Nick Carraway in a nut house? What? His time with Gatsby gave him a nervous breakdown? Why? You stink Chris Pearce (screenwriter) This concept undermines F. Scott's entire point!!!!This is an unnecessary film captured in the swirling glory of 3-D, sweeping cameras, excess and the decadent rich ad nauseam. With the author's prose in actual words on the screen and fireworks in the sky, we are given a weak script, failed characterizations devoid of all meaning. The music takes you completely out of the jazz age and dumps you in a glitzy nightmare populated with no characters no audiences can invest in. On a personal note DiCaprio is not good looking enough nor talented enough to play Gatsby. No one is. There should be a rule regarding certain pieces of literature, filmmakers can't film them just to make money. Walking out of the film I am reminded of parties I have attended, and stayed too late, only to wake up amongst the stale remains and debris of the previous nights excess. When DiCaprio said, 'Old Sport', the audience laughed. Like the film itself, it was unnatural.",Null,14,28,10 May 2013
Jurassic Park," Honoring it's 10th anniversary, A Fan Gushes
","I was the editor of a busy publication when Jurassic Park opened, but that didn't stop me from playing hooky and seeing the movie. Having read the book the moment it came out, I was impatient for the movie that would marry the scientific scribe of future possibilities to the man many call the master of motion picture art, Spiels.  Spielburg and Crichton -- what a hellava combination. The movie did not disappoint me in the least, I hung onto the arms of my seat and let the movie pull me in inch by inch.  When T-Rex was chasing Ellie and Ian, I felt myself slipping down the chair.  The wind was in my hair, I could almost smell the dino spore, the storm, Muldoon (so perfectly cast), Denis Nedry and the kitchen scene, and I didn't even mind that it was a stark impossibility T-Rex could have gotten into the pavilon at the end of the movie.It was magic. Then and now.In the past ten years, I have watched JP 1 -- at least five times a year. When I'm working I have to have it on sometimes -- even if I'm not glued to the TV. I just have to hear it. There is a rhythm to the narrative, one I would think Koep created and Spiels enhanced -- moving forward, echoing Ian's observation, 'Life moves forward, it breaks through barriers, painfully...' It is among my top ten films, and no matter how cheesy, I will always go see a JP movie.To be fair and realistic, I am not so blind to think JP is a perfect movie. So here are some things I didn't like - though through the ages I have softened considerably.A - Ian was supposed to be an early 20's kid. (but we love Jeff G)B - The whole migration angle from the book was missed.C- I would have liked more 'Dino Snacks' (humans) on the island.D- I wish Henry Wu (B.D. Wong) had a bigger roleE- I missed the end scene of the book, Oh to have been in the Raptor cave. Oh, to have seen the Raptors out on the beach waiting for the transport like birds.F - I wanted John H to be more of a bad guy -- I liked him too much.All in all, JP 1 will always be in my little boy heart. I have collected all of the toys and figures. I have the posters and books, DVDs etc. As my father once pointed out, 'Son, you got dinosaurs on the brain!'",Null,0,1,13 May 2003
The Island," Superb Action Sci-Fi Twister with great moments!
","From the first frame onward I loved this movie. Though others have said it was a well worn path we'd seen before in these kinds of films, I didn't care, mind or for that matter agree with them. This is a Saturday afternoon at the movies film with all the trimmings. Got it on Netflix and 24 hours later I bought it. It's one of those films you can have on in the background while you're messing around the house on the weekend -- clued into when the next cool scene will unfold, you take a break and watch it. I couldn't wait for the bad guy to get his. I was thrilled at the character development of the Security Officer. The action (or chase) sequences were top-notch. Perhaps I'm just a big boy and that's why I loved it. It did mix my favorite things together, there were twists and state-of-the-art bang-bang and I love that. As for acting--why were the critics so down on Ewan and Scarlett? They were believable and good enough to sustain themselves. So Mr. Bay you keep on trucking. Well written big ole dumb movie where you know the bad guys gonna get his!!",9,1,1,28 February 2006
