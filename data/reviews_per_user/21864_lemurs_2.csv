The Blair Witch Project," I thought it was original, but I was wrong
","When I first saw the Blair Witch Project I already knew it was fake, but I wanted to still see it with an open mind.  I fully understand that getting lost can cause intense emotional stress and I would probably freak out if I were lost in the woods.  Now with that said, I must say that after the first five minutes of them realization of getting lost set in, I was bored out of my mind.  I mean wow 20 minutes of exposition and one hour of 'oh my god, we're lost' is just not enough for a movie.  I found the only decent factors was that it was a very good, but tedious psychological study on people getting lost, and the fact that yes, it was an original idea.  Then I looked right here on the IMDb and found out that it is nothing more than a REMAKE of another film.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Titanic," Sad acting, Sad effects, and pitiful plot
","Ok, so i was dragged to this movie and gave it a fair shot.  It didn't even deserve that.  I won't even go into the acting much or the sappy, melodramatic, horrible plot, but i will talk a lot about the much ballyhooed special effects.  First, most of the blue screen mattes are poorly done, and halos aplenty show up in many scenes, most notably when Kate Winslet is hanging off the back of the ship.  Second,  the far-away overly matte shots of the ship sailing, in no way fit the colorization of the film, not to mention that the ship did not have any bow wave as it traveled through the ocean;  they started half way down the ship.  Granted, most movie's effects are far from anything real, but even low budget action movies look better than this.  If you want effects, go to ILM, otherwise, don't waste your time and write them out of the script.  And now the acting.  Utter filth.  The Pro/Epilouge's acting was sub-b-movie quality, along with the rest of the film.  The only ok acting in the entire movie was accomplished by Billy Zane and Bill Paxton,  who, are pretty much b-movie actors anyway, so their performance was their status quo.",Null,2,3,7 August 1998
