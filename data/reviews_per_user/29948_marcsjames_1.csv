Iron Man 3," I don't do the whole numbers thing, its nonsensical.
","A disappointingly average finale to what has been a progressively anti-climatic trilogy, although it is considerably better than the second film due to its status as a true blockbuster that will have most audiences ravenously eating a large box of popcorn in under an hour. The main problem with the film was that it played it very safe, far to safe for the finale of what could have been a genre defining trilogy if done correctly. I feel that the film was sufficiently dumbed down to achieve its blockbuster status with sub par writing throughout and levels of exposition that border on condescending. Although this may seem overly critical I feel that it was a marked improvement from the second film however, I found that the ridiculous amount of comic relief found throughout the film would have been far more appropriate in Iron Man 2. I am in no way saying that the film should be 'Nolan serious' however, I feel that such a significant Marvel film should have a more substantial ending with some level of catharsis at the end SPOILER ALERT>>>>>> * would have preferred it if Pepper Pots died* as I feel that it would have lent far more to the further development of Tony Starks character for the second Avengers film.This film adds new meaning to the phrase 'meh'.",5,2,4,2 May 2013
