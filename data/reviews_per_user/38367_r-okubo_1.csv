The Hangover," the hangover
","If the 'shit' in the above sentence bothered you, do not watch this movie. The Hangover is an adult comedy and politically incorrect (like most comedies are best) until the last strand of hair. So if you want a mood allowed for children, look for another film.Part of being an adult humor is no demerit in any sense. Actually it does with that is the funniest movie of the year so far. It makes you laugh from the first minute until the last. And I doubt that any movie that will debut can overcome it.The film opens with Phil telling the bride that her wedding will not happen. The groom is missing. 'Fucked up everything,' he says. We returned two days of this event. The groom, Doug, is departing to Las Vegas with his two groomsmen and his brother for his bachelor party in 'sin city'.One of the groomsmen, Phil (Bradley Cooper) is a college professor, married with a son, who says he hates his life. Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist who tells everyone who is a doctor and is completely dominated by the female (vixen) that betrayed at a party on a boat. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is the half brother of the bride 'slow' mentally that, legally, can not get too close to schools, 'He looks like a Gremlin. Comes up with the instruction manual. ', One refers to it.Next day the big night, they wake up with the room totally destroyed, a child crying in the closet, a tiger in the bathroom, one missing tooth, a chicken and the missing groom. Since we do not find it anywhere, they begin to retrace your way through clues they find. To make matters worse, when the valet will deliver them to the car, a brand new Mercedes-law of the groom, delivers a police car.The search for the groom makes one visit Chapel Weddings, overtake a Chinese mobster effeminate, enter the house of a prostitute, make a stop at the hospital and met with Mike Tyson. This tour for a long day for Vegas looking groom, causes are slowly reconstructing what happened the night before. And notice I did not use the word reminiscing.Director Todd Philips has in his hand a film filled with bizarre characters in absurd situations. Of course, the trip to 'Sin City' serves as a shock therapy for all characters. And this is the best movie. Looks like his previous films, Awesome Day and Road Trip, were just the outline of what was to come.In the end it was just a question: what the hell does that chicken there?",Null,0,0,4 November 2014
