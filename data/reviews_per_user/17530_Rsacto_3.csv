Casablanca," A classic wartime/noir pic & entertaining as-all-get-out despite the bad casting of the romantic leads
","I still enjoy watching Casablanca, mainly for the snappy, rapier-wit dialogue written by the amazing Epstein brothers in the first half of pic. Peter Lorre's lines as 'Ugarte' with Bogart never fail to get a laugh out of audiences: 'You despise me, don't you?' Bogart: 'Well, if I gave you any thought I probably would.' Truly scintillating script-writing.I love watching the supporting cast members in Rick's 'Cafe Americain' who have been indisputably reported as refugees who had actually fled Nazi-occupied Europe. When they sang 'La Marseillaise,' the tears in their eyes were the real thing. Pretty hard to top that, especially in a film made during the early days of WWII. Unfortunately, the Epsteins were given another writing assignment halfway through pic, and Howard Koch was ordered to crank out the melodramatic denouement of the yet unfinished script, written just days ahead of the actual shoot. Madeleine LeBeau (featured in a brief dalliance with Bogart's Rick in pic) is easily the sexiest woman in pic (at 17 years of age, a recent French refugee herself, and quintessentially nubile). She genuinely cries like a baby as she sings her French national anthem. Few actresses ever upstaged the polished super-star Ingrid Bergman, with the extreme close-ups of her carefully posed, glowing, porcelain complexion lighting up any theater screening pic. But the slinky, succulent, petit morceau LeBeau (who was the one player, besides Claude Rains, who exuded any genuine sexual energy in pic) still managed to steal the limelight in her small, supporting role.Bogart struts and grunts through pic with the same tough guy persona he uses in every gangster film he's ever been in. Imagine instead the witty and urbane Dick Powell (who breathed life into the very same 'Phillip Marlowe' character in 'Murder, My Sweet' that Bogart couldn't even touch in his portrayal of that private-eye in 'The Big Sleep') as Rick, instead of the grumpy, unappealing Bogart. Powell was a former song-and-dance man who seamlessly transitioned over to dramatic roles, and he would have given a nuanced, heartfelt perf to the character of Rick. Perhaps he was unavailable, but he's the actor I would have cast as Rick. Ingrid Bergman herself seems like she hasn't the slightest sexual interest in the aging, sawed-off Bogart. She also mailed in her scenes with her husband Paul Henreid, who acts as stiff as a board with Bergman, though at 6' 3' Henreid at least didn't have to stand on an 'Apple Box' (derisively known in The Biz as 'The Man-Maker' in snarky filmmaking jargon) like the 5' 8' Bogart was forced to use in order to match the the height of the towering Swede Bergman's 5' 10' (without heels) stature. Bergman, obviously a sophisticated, blase', 30ish-looking woman, looks so far out of Bogart's league that it's almost laughable. Cary Grant was the only male lead to really ignite an on-screen chemistry in his roles with The Viking Queen.Predictably, the stuffy, classically-trained, over-rehearsed Bergman didn't have a clue on how to umpire Claude Rains' constant flirtations with her. Improv was never Bergman's strong suit. The ever-playful Rains stole every scene with Bergman, who turned out to be an odd, dour casting choice indeed for the role of the young, naive woman who was Bogart's young Paris squeeze. Worst of all, Bergman's crassly imperious and unmistakably condescending air in her dialogue with Sam, Bogart's black piano player, revealed her revoltingly supercilious sense of Nordic superiority. The fiery, spectacular Parisienne Madeleine LeBeau would have been a much more believable and tantalizing choice for the 'impressionable young girl' that the worldly, independent Scandinavian Bergman ridiculously claimed to be when she fell for and married Henreid's heroic resistance-fighter character. If only the story had flashbacked to Bogart in his earlier Paris romance with the mouthwatering, patently underage LeBeau, maybe it would have infused pic with the Hays Code-busting, steamy sexual energy that it needed to propel it above its predictable, corny, propaganda-infused climax. Kind of like what Bogart actually did in his real life, when he gave his much older wife Mayo Methot the heave-ho to marry the beautiful 19 year-old Hollywood MAW ('Model-Actress-Whatever') named Lauren Bacall, who was an eye-popping twenty-five years his junior (they were enviously referred to in 1940s Tinseltown as 'Bogey & Baby'). Life imitates art.'We'll always have Paris,' Bogart pontificates to Bergman as he stoically gives her up to Henreid in the last scene, who then both escape Casablanca to Lisbon by plane. Seriously?! Even a whiskey-soaked, man's-man like Rick would have shot Henreid's character dead in the blink of an eye to hang on to the stunning - if icy and unapproachable - Bergman.The saccharine Hollywood Ending with Bogart walking off with Claude Rains with their backs to us into the fog (actually a darkened sound stage at Warner Brothers Culver City lot), with Rains offering to use the 10,000 francs he lost in a bet with Bogart to get them both to safety of the Free French garrison at Brazzaville, has become the most quoted line in pic: 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' That mawkish, syrupy line - written by none other than pic's producer Hal B. Wallis himself - ran neck-and-neck for the final looped line in pic with the much more cynical, and entertaining, alternative line that he wrote: 'Louis, I always knew that you had a little larceny in your heart,' but that line was finally considered too unpatriotic for a wartime propaganda pic.",8,3,5,6 October 2016
Nightcrawler," Dan Gilroy's debut at feature directing is a cinematic tour de force, and the against-type casting of Jake Gyllenhaal is inspired
","Casting Jake Gyllenhall was the first of the masterful strokes by director Dan Gilroy in creating 'Nightcrawler.' Jake is usually just too darn likable, and thus might seem unsuitable for the evil lead in pic. However, Jake rose to challenge by masterfully playing his character against-type, as a chillingly sociopathic, ruthlessly upwardly mobile wannabe video news stringer. (An appropriately applicable definition of Hollywood/L.A. is that it is 'The place where you become what you pretend to be.')Jake reportedly lost nearly thirty pounds to play the gaunt, soulless, Mephistophelean petty criminal, Louis Bloom, who accidentally stumbles on an exciting way to earn instant cash from TV stations: by videotaping on-scene police activity and bloody accidents. Jake figures out early on that he needs a police radio call 'scanner' to find the action. He later barges into a local TV station during night hours, and discovers a ready TV market in Rene Russo, playing a desperate, over-the-hill, graveyard-shift news director looking for gory, ratings-pumping news stories.Jake 'hires' a naive rube for as assistant to cover the police calls and give him lightning driving directions t calls through the streets of L.A. The goal is to be first on the scene, get the video shot, then hotfoot the footage to the station for a hopefully exclusive airing on the news. Jake pays the assistant practically nothing, but salves him with ongoing promotional 'titles,' such as Vice-President (of apparently nothing, as far as a real company is concerned). When the assistant wises up and demands a large share of the sale of a major news story, Jake schemes to eliminate his now-troublesome assistant by setting him up to become part of the news himself in an impromptu but lethal final assignment. Director Dan Gilroy's earthly, noir-like photography of the L.A. streets is shot almost totally at night. Gilroy captures the ever-present juxtaposition of the saccharine West L.A. affluence and the searingly dangerous underbelly of the L.A./Hollywood scene.Truly riveting, entertaining, and best of all, pic does not suffer from the typical 'Hollywood Ending' that has ruined many films.

Dunkirk," Real WW II vintage fighter planes in aerial combat, and abject fear etched on every face faithfully deliver the film's sole premise: War Is Hell.
","As a pilot myself, the gobsmacking POV aerial dog-fighting sequences alone were worth the price of admission. Director Chris Nolan used actual World War II vintage fighter planes instead of CGI, cartoon-like substitutes. Real pilots flying real fighters, chasing the enemy planes through the clouds and skimming over the surface of the English Chanel. Punctuated by the visceral growl of twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines powering the British Spitfires overflying the bedlam on the beaches below. Wow.Before I saw pic (at an IMAX in 70mm, the only way to fully appreciate pic), I read a scathing review by Rex Reed, usually a reliable and fair critic. Reed's review scolded Nolan for having the music pot out much of the dialogue in pic. Incredibly, Reed totally missed the point of pic, which is an almost total reliance on visuals, with the music track and voice tracks in distant secondary and tertiary roles respectively. Pic is a quintessential motion picture, meaning it is meant to be seen and actually felt by the audience, not heard like a play. In this regard, Nolan succeeds exceptionally well. Pic is clearly reminiscent of many of the silent films of yore, which relied more on visuals than the talkies that eventually succeeded them. Yet Nolan avoids the often hammy performances found with most silent film actors, instead relying on the bowel-stirring fear etched on the faces of soldiers either trapped in a sinking ship or helplessly being shot at by an unseen enemy.In short, Nolan understands, and, most importantly, executes the most basic premise of motion pictures: show us, don't tell us.Some reviewers have complained that actors of some stature, like Kenneth Branagh, were relegated to embarrassingly minor roles, and the meaty roles were given to unknowns. Well, this historical event is about 400,000 British soldiers trapped on the French beach at Dunkirk. There was no Patten, MacArthur, or Montgomery involved. It was a rescue effort thrown together and run by whomever was available. There will be no nominations for Best Actor. There is no place for such an upstaging role when juxtaposed against this colossal cinematic tableau of an entire army facing either rescue or utter defeat.Reviewers who have complained about the lack of character development simply fail to understand exactly what, and not who, the real star and the premise of pic are: War itself, and that War Is Hell. The absence of the standard-Hollywood, predictable, three-act American Narrative format is a refreshing change indeed, yet many have complained about the 'lack of story.' There are four hundred-thousand men trying to escape annihilation facing a cold, empty sea, getting shot to pieces with the Germans at their backs. No story? Are you kidding?! That's 400,000 stories, and we get to see a handful of them registered in extreme closeups of their faces. You feel like you were really there, within the claustrophobic confines of a ship full of soldiers desperate to escape the slaughter, or the dizzying POV shots of aerial combat filmed from real fighter planes in real flight. As for music and the shattering sound of bombs and ordnance exploding covering up dialogue, it gave pic a verisimilitude that most war pics lack. War is noisy. Really noisy.",10,6,14,28 July 2017
