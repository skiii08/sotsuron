The Ring," Scary beyond scary!
","The Ring is easily one of the scariest movies I have ever seen - if not the scariest. Usually I am not a fan of the horror genre, but this movie was different in that it was more suspenseful. It kept you on the edge of your seat throughout and there were some truly tense moments. Overall, the story was well developed, the acting was great and the imagery in the movie was perfect. Perhaps the only real flaw was that certain things aren't explained entirely, but really this doesn't take anything away from the movie. If you like scary, see the Ring - you wont be disappointed! 8/10",10,0,0,16 November 2002
Signs," Brilliant, Thrilling and Superbly Acted
","M. Night's Shyamalan's Signs is one of the best films of 2002. What makes the thriller so effective is that Shyamalan does not have to use a lot of gore or cheap thrills to captivate the audience. The movie's simple tone makes every thrilling move even more thrilling than it would seem in an average thriller. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and the child actors give a great performance as the family whose lives have been altered by these mysterious 'SIGNS'. Beware though, that by the end of the movie, you will find out the true meaning of 'SIGNS'. Really, the only disappointment with the movie is the ending, which has become a signature for Shyamalan in his previous films , 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'. This movie is setup so well for a thrilling ending, that it comes off as rather anticlimactic. Overall though, one of the best suspense thrillers you will see. 7/10",9,0,1,26 October 2002
