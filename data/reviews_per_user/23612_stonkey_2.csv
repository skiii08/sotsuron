The Blair Witch Project," This is no ordinary scary movie
","I'm of a generation that knows the horror genre primarily as a gore-ridden slasher fest. I'm talking about a type of movie that sought to scare through cheap shock tactics that never work the second time around (IMHO). This movie does not employ shock value. It keeps you guessing, keeps you wondering, keeps you worrying. This is not a fun scare. This movie follows you home and whispers things in your ear, conjures images from the movie in your mind, when you're trying to get to sleep. It takes our primal fears of the dark and unknown and makes them a raw, visceral reality. An experience of eight horrifying days is distilled into one eight-seven minute descent into walking nightmare. Do not watch it alone. Do not watch it at night. It is the most effective, consistently horrifying piece of cinema I have ever seen. I could not have imagined that a movie could scare me so much. Anyone who has not seen it should take heed: it will hurt your mind. It is not gross. It is hardly bloody. It is hardly violent. The R rating is primarily because of extensive profanity. But it should be rated R regardless of the profanity. Don't take your kids to see it unless they've done something bad.",10,2,3,20 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," An intellectual war movie
","This isn't a movie about war, per se. It's about the people that fight it, people just like us. It's about why we fight, about how meaningless war can be to one man but a code of honor to another. Some (in this movie) look at it as a way to glorify themselves, no matter what the cost. Others see it as constant fear and suffering. It depends on how high you are in the chain of command. Extremely effective voice-overs ask questions we don't usually verbalize--questions that usually remain as bothersome feelings from the subconscious. Also extremely effective musical score. None of that constant, pumping 'Armageddon' rubbish that brow-beats us into making some kind of emotional reaction. Instead, the music in 'Thin Red Line' complements the scenes. A great ensemble movie. Caviezel's facial expressions are dialogue in themselves. Admittedly, the movie has a slower pace, especially considering it's genre, but it builds slowly and quietly, in between the lines, until you're left with something quite beautiful. It ages on the screen like a fine wine and your left to drink it at the closing credits.",9,0,1,20 July 1999
