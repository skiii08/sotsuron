Resident Evil: Afterlife," A must watch in 3D
","Overall entertaining. I've watched all the other installments and in preference: [1] apocalypse, [2] afterlife, [3] resident evil, [4] extinction. Milla is stunning as usual, really dig her 'moves'. Watched it in 2D & 3D for a comparison. 3D is the ultimate choice, don't miss it or you gonna regret it. Credits to the scene where Alice swept down the building with hordes of zombies on her heels is real cool. Hoping in RE5 Alice still have remnants of the T-virus and causing more havoc. Wish Wesker has more scenes with Alice though, kinda abrupt when they both met. Luther is great and so is Claire and is that 'jill valentine' at the end? RE5-bring it on! And more face time for ALICE please. More mutations yet to come I hope. TQ!",10,5,12,23 September 2010
