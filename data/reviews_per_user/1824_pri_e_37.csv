The Blair Witch Project," Wasn't scary, too hyped
","When I first heard about this movie I honestly believed it to be real, the website scared the shit out of me before I had even seen the movie. Then I found out it was fake and so the effect began to wear off even the website was change customised so we could see updates on the possible production of two more projects. Finally I hired this movie, and all I can say was is that it occasionally had funny and scary parts but it's scary enough to be classified as one of the scariest movies ever made. If there was anything I was rewinding the ending thinking 'what the F*** ?' I thought the movie was creative but it's not something I would watch over and over again like some sort of cult. Also I really hope that there will be no continuing franchise of the Blair Witch Project",5,0,2,23 April 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," creative
","*possible spoilers ahead*The moment I finished watching volume one I couldn't wait to see what the next installment was and I was pleasantly surprised with the result. If anyone expects the pace and gore of the first installment, they are very much mistaken! This movie focuses on the bride's revenge against Sidewinder, California Mountain Snake and finally Bill. Uma Thurman proves her range as an actress by showing the struggle of her character's emotional stability. You finally understand why the Deadly Viper Squad were out to destroy the Bride and funnily enough you actually find the character of Bill likeable. My only question is what happened to O-Ren Ishii's friend?Other than that the movie is really great, this is by far Tarantino's best work",8,1,2,26 April 2004
50 First Dates," Adorable!
","The moment I heard that Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler were teaming up again for another romantic comedy, I knew that I wanted to see it. '50 First Dates' did live up to my expectations with everyone doing a great acting job in it. Barrymore and Sander still exhibit the same on-screen chemistry as they did in 'The Wedding Singer'. I also love seeing the familiar faces from most of Sandler's previous movies appear in this film, someone who stands out to me is Sean Astin, what a turn around from playing Samwise Gamgee!It's a definite must see for all the romantics out there, I give the movie a 7/10!",7,0,0,26 March 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Interesting
","I felt that this movie was quite entertaining and intelligent, something different from what has been cast upon us in the movie department as of late. The fact that it is a real story makes it all the more better, and the performances are just unbelievable. Leonardo DiCaprio had the hardest task of making a movie that surpassed his performance in 'Titanic', I feel that his portrayal of Frank Abnagale does this. Tom Hanks is always a joy to watch onscreen and can just about pull of any character that is given to him.I give this movie an 8 out of 10",8,1,2,31 January 2003
The Ring," Scary with a disappointing ending
","*spoilers ahead*I had heard that this movie was scary, and it did freak me out at some bits especially with the creepy music and really fast moving scenes. However after watching it I found myself confused because some of the things didn't make sense.1) After her body was discovered, why couldn't her soul rest?2) If Naomi Watts saw the original, why did Martin Henderson when he saw the exact same thing? I mean so what if you made a copy of the tape, she should have thought of that if she wanted to save him as well3) How the hell would you explain that to her sister, since she wanted to know how her daughter died?It definitely had scare factors in it, probably won't be able to sleep tonight but I think it should have ended with the soul finally able to rest",7,0,0,24 December 2002
Spider-Man 2," fantastic sequel!
","There's always one thing I fear when it comes to movies and that is sequels! I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this movie so I tried to ignore it and go into the movies with no expectations. This movie actually blew me away by its content, it didn't focus on some 'I hate everyone, I'm evil and I want to kill the world' storyline. Instead it focused on how heroes are within us all (as Aunt May said), how technology has consumed us and how its important to sustain love no matter how difficult the circumstances.Peter Parker (Maguire) is still fighting crime but he's also trying to fight his guilt over his Uncle Ben's death, his true feelings for Mary Jane (Dunst) and the truth about his identity to Harry (James Franco).I think its a movie people would really enjoy, I have it an 8/10",8,0,0,12 July 2004
The Others," Elegant and Chilling
","At first while I was watching this film, it felt very confusing and slow at times but once you get to the ending it all comes together and makes sense. I thought that Nicole Kidman's performance was excellent, and I hope she does become an Oscar contender for 2002. The children's performances were just as good, they seemed to really connect as a family. I suspected from the beginning that there was more to Mrs Mills, Mr Tuttle and Lydia, it just seemed like a given. But the last 10 minutes of the movie is thrilling!!",8,1,2,25 November 2001
Ocean's Twelve," its watchable....
","When I heard they were making a sequel to Ocean's 11, I was a bit skeptical and after watching the movie last night, I had every reason to be! While the first movie was all about class and had plenty of twists, this movie was very jumbled and the overall result makes you wonder why they bothered doing the movie at all.In the first movie, i enjoyed the focus being on the plot and only occasionally did they indulge into the characters' backgrounds. However in this movie you just learned too much about them and nothing about the heist. One person I found really annoying in this movie was Catherine Zeta-Jones, her character was annoying and i didn't see any chemistry between herself and Brad Pitt (Rusty).There's not much to say other than its probably something to watch on DVD if even that...",5,0,0,29 January 2005
Lost in Translation," a good effort though a little lost
","I must say that I hadn't heard of this movie before the golden globe awards so I thought I would go and see it and see what the buzz was all about. Firstly I must say this was a really good effort by Sophia Coppola considering her pitiful performance in the last godfather movie (I'm sorry folks that is still unforgivable). The movie has a good cast with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson giving stellar performances with the city of Tokyo epitomising the crisis that both characters are facing. Though they do touch on a romantic sort of bond but more than romantic its a connection of two souls that know that this one week together can perhaps change the course of their lives forever or they weather out the problems that they have for good. I guess it's the ending that brings the rating to 6/10, I guess because it confused me, hopefully I'll get it one day but I still think its a good movie.",6,0,0,18 February 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," An absolute classic !!
","I initially read the book because I head great reviews about it and also because it was good enough for a movie adaption being made about it. I thought the book was excellent so I longed to see the movie and I wasn't disappointed, it was so funny and just like I expected it to be. Renee Zellweger did a brilliant job as Bridget, and pulled off the accent well. I loved Colin Firth, he was so good as Mr Darcy and seeing him play Mark Darcy after Helen Fielding based the character of Mark on Firth's performance in Pride and Prejudice was just great. Hugh Grant was perfect as Daniel and it's good to see him play a different role besides the bumbling love sick man all the time.I thought this was excellent !!!",10,0,0,26 July 2001
Léon: The Professional," Captivating and well acted
","I thought this movie was excellent but it made me cry so much, I thought the acting by all of them was excellent. Natalie Portman is truly a great actress, pulling of Mathilda without a flaw. Jean Reno was great as well, really bringing out the care his character had for Portman's. Credit has to go to Gary Oldman who is so good at playing the villian, I thought this movie was well done",Null,0,1,17 September 2000
The Bourne Identity," interesting
","This movie didn't have any overexposure by the press and was probably only heightened by Matt Damon coming to Australia to promote it. I thought it was a good film, and Matt Damon plays the part of Jason Bourne convincingly. Franka Potente fit the role of Marie, an innocent but curious woman who gets caught up in Bourne's world by mistake. They didn't emphasise the romance between the two characters as a key feature in this movie which was good because that wasn't what the story was suppose to focus on. I have to say though the C.I.A must have some lousy agents if they can't gun down one of their own, yet that 'one' agent can outsmart them all....didn't they get the same training?!!",7,0,1,11 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Simply breathtaking...
","From the first moment the movie starts you are immediately captivated by the story that evolves. The cinematography is just amazing, Peter Jackson did an incredible job conveying to us the times of the Hobbits. I believe the cast had excellent chemistry and it's refreshing to see a group of actors who seem to really break into their roles. I'm so happy that Elijah Wood played Frodo, he's a great actor and doesn't get as nearly enough recognition as he deserves. It's also a good breakthrough for Viggo Mortenson who has minor roles in '28 Days' and 'A Perfect Murder', Liv Tyler is sweet as Arwen and I look forward to her character expanding in the next two installments. Ian McKellen is just a great actor to watch and really brought Gandalf to life, Sean Bean again is another actor who doesn't get nearly as enough credit as he deserves. Orlando Bloom is a cutie as Legolas, the hobbits are just funny to watch especially Sean Astin's Sam. Cate Blanchett was rather freaky as Galadriel, but I think the way her character signed off to Frodo is just the beginning of our understanding of her.All in all this is just an amazing movie!!",10,1,1,21 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Confusing and Disappointing
","*spoilers ahead*I didn't know what to expect when I heard that the Wachowski brothers were making 2 more matrix movies but now that I've seen them I wish they had just left it alone. 'Reloaded' was much better than this mediocre movie, I gave it a 4/10 based on the special effects and probably the storyline of the first part of the film, the rest of the movie went downhill from there. It's absolutely disappointing that the first movie which had so much promise and power had a terrible conclusion in the end. Neo didn't make any sense in this movie and by the end of it I wondered whether it was better if he had remained Thomas Anderson. I mean he sacrificed his existence for Zion and ended up where exactly? In the machine world? Then there's poor Trinity who's role in the 2nd and 3rd movies ended up just being some love sick girlfriend who died again for no noble reason at all, what happened to the butt kicking woman from the first movie? Then there's Morpheus who was slick in the first movie but ended up being a total whiner and pansy by the last movie? Here are my questions-What happened to Tank? Why the hell did Link and Zee get a storyline when their characters were so boring? Why didn't Naiobi get a role in the first movie? Why was Agent Smith so determined to take over everything including destroying Machine city? Why didn't they give Neo and Trinity a happy ending? Why did the oracle, ghost and that indian girl survive?Overall the Wachowski brothers completely destroyed the concept of the Matrix....",4,0,0,21 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Disappointing!
","I had heard great reviews about this movie, I wasn't terribly sure whether they should have made a 3rd installment to the already successful 'Terminator' movies. After watching this film, this is the opinion that I have: this movie doesn't even compare to the brilliance that was the first two movies. Despite Nick Stahl and Claire Danes doing a great job as John Connor and Kate Brewster, I thought their storyline way way too soft. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good in his role as the T-800, however he looked as if he didn't have the same interest in playing the role. This T-800 lacked the character that he had in the previous movies despite the notion that he's coming back as different models. I thought that Kristanna Loken was weak as the TX-Terminatrix, not even close to being as sinister as Arnie was in the first movie and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the second movie. It's plainly obvious that she was chosen for the role to entice males into watching this movie and also maybe to show that women are strong etc. I'm a woman and I wasn't impressed by her at all, a man should have played the villain or better yet Robert Patrick as a stronger terminator model.Don't expect anything like the first two installments, the only thing that stuck to true terminator style was the truck scene. Other than that you wouldn't even think you were watching a 'Terminator' film.Truly disappointing....",6,0,0,20 July 2003
"I, Robot"," i loved it!
","I initially saw a little clip of this movie on an Australian talk show and thought the special effects looked really lame so I thought I'd give it a miss. Luckily this was the only movie running at the only time I had to see one, and overall I really loved it!! Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, a guy who's past affects his judgement about the present and the future, in particular robots. When a scientist appears to have committed suicide, he begins to uncover something more serious going on with the robots and the ppl around him. Bridget Moynahan plays Dr Susan Calvin, a psychiatrist who hides behind big words and robots to prevent her emotions being let out. Once Susan meets Det Spooner, she's not intrigued by him but the mystery in general. I loved the robot Sonny, if only we could really only someone like him :)I give this movie an 8/10 and recommend this to any sci-fi fans out there",8,0,0,17 August 2004
Save the Last Dance," I loved it !!
","This made me want to dance, I thought that Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas had excellent chemistry and excellent moves. There were some stereotypes however involved, but nothing extreme that you could just sit there and point them out. I loved the music and I thought the clothes were kewl",8,28,56,10 April 2001
Collateral," good but not great
","possible spoilers...I was looking forward to seeing this movie based on the reviews I had heard about it but also from the trailer. However upon watching it I have to say its a good movie but the not the best Tom Cruise movie I've seen. Cruise plays Vincent, a professional killer who picks Max (Jamie Foxx) to drive him to each of his targets unwillingly. Its an interesting storyline to say the least which ties up neatly in the end however I found that it just didn't do what Cruise's 'Minority Report' did in terms of mystery. I felt sorry for Mark Ruffalo who had a useless role as an undercover cop who is trying to figure out the deal with Vincent himself, his character didn't develop enough and was taken away pretty fast. Jada Pinkett-Smith did a good job in the movie, its good to see her stray away from the tough female roles that she usually plays. I thought it was wrong to shoot this movie using digital camera-work because it looked really bad and made the camera work look really amateur.I gave this movie a 6/10, again its good but not great.",6,0,0,18 November 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," fantastic!
","I was surely NOT disappointed when I saw this movie, I thought that the change of director was the best thing that happened to this series. He didn't rely on too many special effects to create such a wonderful adaptation of J.K Rowling's third novel. It's great to see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint have really grown into their roles and I think we can expect even more greater things as each novel is made in the future.
The only flaws that I can note is some of the important details from the book that they left out in the movie, I think they could have made it even more fantastic than it already is.Other than that, I'm looking forward to the next installment and the sixth novel!",10,0,0,3 July 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Definitely fast but dunno about the furious part
","This movie rocked in some senses but then I think the ending was abrupt and predictable. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel work well as a team, despite Dom's attitude to the others but the friendship seemed a lot more geunine. Letty was a kewl character, they should have explored it more though. Mia was just another female added in to make Brian's character well a man off course. The car scenes were just excellent, if you definitely have a thing for cars and speed well then this rocks. It has similarities to 'Gone in 60 Seconds', however I have a different liking for both.",7,0,0,23 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Classy and Sweet
","I thought that the movie was really great, I'm not a huge George Clooney fan but I think he did a good job in this movie. I think the best role was played by Brad Pitt, he was just brilliant and hilarious. The whole cast had chemistry which I think is an essential element if you want a movie like this to work. I have to say Julia Robert's role was very hyped but it was so minor, she was a good ensemble but nothing special.I loved it!",8,0,0,13 January 2002
The Pianist," Compelling and Sad
","I had heard so much about this movie and when I finally got around to watching it, I can see why Adrien Brody won Best Actor and Roman Polanski - Best Director. You are taken on such a sad journey of bravery by not only the lead character but by everyone who suffered during the war. What's disturbing is that it all really happened, usually when you watch a movie you are taken away from the world as we know it, but you know when you watch this movie that it is only an interpretation of real life tragic events.",9,1,2,28 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Truly amazing
","I recently just got 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' for Xmas and so it had been the second time I'd seen it since January at the cinemas. After finishing, I couldn't wait until I saw the next installment, and I surely wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'.*Possible spoilers ahead*We continue on where we left of with Frodo and Sam going to Mordor to destroy the ring. Some say that the beginning should have been a re-cap of what happened in the previous installment but if anyone really noticed they were recapping things. For example- what happened to Gandalf (the Grey) when they thought he died, explained how Boromir died, what the love story was between Aragon and Arwen. I mean if you wanted to add recaps, then that would probably take another 15 minutes to do!!I didn't feel that there was enough of Frodo and Sam, but I suppose they wanted to focus this time on Aragon, Legalos, Gimli, Merry and Pippin. We are introduced to some new characters King Theoden and Eowyn (Shieldmaiden of Rohan). I know that they are trying to introduce Eowyn as part of some love triangle with Aragon and Arwen, but it doesn't work. There's something enchanting about Aragon's love story with Arwen, how there love keeps the both of them going.Gollum/Smeagol was an interesting character and for once the CGI effects were believable, just like the character of Dobby in 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. His mental fight between good and evil was good to watch, with an ending making you want them to hurry up the process of 'Return of the King' for at least June of next year!I give it a 10, I haven't read the books so I can't really agree or disagree with those who believe Peter Jackson has changed the story. People say it's too much about fantasy, my question is what would you liked to have been? Why can't people escape the strangeness of this world and get involved with a whole other world that conveys a whole different way of life? I've also read that some believe this glamourises war, I believe that to be UNTRUE. It's a book that was written a long time ago, little did Tolkien now how screwed up the world would be now but I do not think it was on purpose. Nor do I believe that Peter Jackson is encouraging it either! He's doing what the book has written, nothing more or less.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just fantastic as Frodo and Sam, there's something warm and truthful about the way they convey the characters. There's something about Viggo Mortensen's acting that makes people wonder why they didn't acknowledge him before as an actor, he show's Aragon's torment between his duty and his fear. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are classic as Legalos and Gimli, showing the vast difference in thinking between the elf and dwarf. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are fantastic to watch as Merry and Pippin, we got to see a more emotional side to their characters as opposed to their cheery and fun dispositions in 'FOTR'.I recommend the 'Lord of the Rings' installments for those who enjoy these kind of genres. If your critical of it, by all means you are going to be bored and not really see the value of the storylines.",10,0,0,27 December 2002
Coyote Ugly," Expect the Unexpected
","I loved this movie !! Although I have to say the ad is misleading, as I think the equivalent of this movie that had to do with the bar is at least 25 minutes !! The chemistry between Violet and Kevin was sweet to watch, and also the development of that song she wrote was quite nice as well. This movie deserves alot more credit and they all did a wonderful job in it",Null,1,1,27 December 2000
Moulin Rouge!," absolutely moving
","I can't believe how excellent this movie is, I'm sorry that some people felt it wasn't worth their money because honestly I'd pay to see it again and again. Not only was it so moving but it makes you really think about love, and not in such a wishy washy way but something that can last forever. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were so beautiful in it and their voices too, this is an amazing story and film and I believe that Baz Luhrman is talented....like I said absolutely moving.",10,7,11,13 June 2001
8 Mile," Interesting
","I didn't know whether or not to see this at the movies, so I waited until it came out on DVD. I was pleasantly surprised with how good this movie was, even though they say it kind of parallels Eminem's life, you can tell they've tried to show a more kinder/intelligent side of Eminem that he obviously doesn't portray in his songs. All the characters were played well, they weren't over the top nor did they change who they were in the film like most other Hollywood films.Eminem definitely deserved the oscar for 'lose yourself', this film deserves more credit",7,0,0,17 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A good surprise
","I hadn't heard very much about the movie but I'm happy about that because it surprised me in a good way! Uma Thurman gives the performance of her life in 'Kill Bill',  you really feel for the character and support her need for vengeance. I was happy with the casting, I thought everyone did a great job. I cannot wait until volume 2, I have a feel it will be just as good as the first half!",9,0,0,18 October 2003
The Mummy Returns," This sequel is excellent !
","They usually say sequels to movies can be pretty lame, but 'The Mummy Returns' blew that right into the water. I thought this movie was creative and alot of fun, and the computer special effects were not too much at all. Truthfully if the movie didn't have the special effects well it really wouldn't make any of it believable now, would it ?! Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do a great job of reprising the eternal love between Rick and Evie, Freddie Boath did a great job as Alex and his character did seem to be a stronger combination of and than his parents. You have to love John Hannah as Jonathan, he's such a sweetie and him being a clutz is just hilarious. Oded Fahr was kewl as Ardeth Bay, he really get's into his role and  I hope to see him in further roles in Hollywood, I loved his character. It was sad to see Imhotep crying when Anaksahamun betray him like that, making him realise that there love wasn't true and that the term eternal love belonged to Rick and Evie. I thought it was excellent and wouldn't mind seeing it again !!",8,1,1,14 May 2001
The Last Samurai," how did cruise not get an ocscar nomination!
","This movie exceeded my expectations, I don't understand why this movie was overlooked by the academy awards panel, were they not watching? Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a man who's torn between the past and what lies ahead in the future. At first he doesn't understand the ways of the samurai but when he is held 'captive' he begins to understand a new way of life and honour. Ken Watanbe plays Katsumoro, a powerful samurai intrigued by the conflict that Nathan has and perhaps the warrior connection between them.This is a movie not to be missed!!",8,1,2,18 February 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Absolutely adore it!
","This is one of the best adaptations of a novel that I've ever seen, I am an absolute fan of Harry Potter!!! Daniel Radcliffe does an excellent job playing our young wizard-to-be and the rest of the cast are just amazing. I can't wait until the next installment comes out, the books contain such excellence that I was afraid the movie was going to be too hyped up. But I knew I wasn't the only one just blown away by this movie, everyone all ages just loved it",10,0,0,1 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Magical like the Novel
","People always say never believe the hype, but I just had a feeling that this movie would be fantastic and was proven right when I watched it. It must be hard trying to adapt a novel into a screenplay but it was done successfully here. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson did a fantastic job as Harry, Ron and Hermione, they seem to be grasping acting even better than the first movie. Although we didn't get to see Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape or Professor Flitwick that much, I'm glad we got to see a lot more of Dumbledore, Richard Harris did a wonderful job in his last role.I am glad that even though there are special effects in the movie, that they are believable unlike 'Attack of the Clones'. I give this movie a 10 out of 10, and recommend this movie to any age group.",7,0,0,3 December 2002
The Green Mile," touching...
","This movie had me sobbing that I think the entire cinema must have heard me !! I can't get over well done this movie was, every character had something about them that made you just want to find out more and more about the movie. The complex storyline of Paul Edgecomb who jouneys up and down the green mile trying to figure out what is so special about John Coffey. Tom Hanks is just excellent as he always is, and Michael Duncan is brilliant as John...he's like a huge baby in it which makes you sad to see what he's convicted off especially how he's afraid of the dark. If there's anything I hope that some academy awards are given to anyone who contributed to this movie",9,0,0,10 March 2000
X2: X-Men United," better than what i expected
","It's a universal fact that usually sequels are an absolute mess in comparison to the originals. However I was surprised at how good X-Men 2 was, as it continued on where the first one left off.The introduction of Pyro and Kurt Wagner complemented the development of the 'good' and the 'bad' side. With Wolverine understanding in some way what had happened to him, you know that in time (if they make another movie) that he will learn the other elements to his personality that he can't yet tap into. How Rogue and Iceman go about showing each other affection makes interesting viewing as it shows that they can only ever get 'emotionally' involved! It was good to see that despite Magneto and Mystique having an angry side to them, they will still stand by other mutants in need. I'm curious to know what Dr Jean Grey's newfound power will be (again that's if they make another movie)My only problem with the movie was the casting of Jean Grey and Scott Summers. James Marsden looks like a kid in comparison to Famke Janssen's older physique....",8,0,0,2 May 2003
Amélie," Enchanting
","This movie is simply enchanting, I had hear wonderful things about the movie and tried convincing many people to accompany me to see it. After persuading two *lol* I just couldn't believe how excellent it was. You don't even care about the fact you have to read subtitles, the acting, storyline and cinematography is just amazing.More people should see this!!",10,0,1,3 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," absolutely brilliant
","I had semi-watched the film and only came in on the ending, so I wanted to hire it again to fully understand the movie. So in a way I wish I didn't know what happened however the movie helped me pick up on the rules and clues the film's crew had developed. The acting was just amazing, they may have put a Hollywood hotshot in there (Bruce Willis) however I think it's Haley Joel Osment, Donnie Wahlberg and Toni Collette who steal the movie. I can understand why they would call this one of the best movies ever made because it truly lives up to standard !",10,0,0,21 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," brilliant!
","This was the one movie I had been waiting for all year so I wasn't disappointed when I saw it yesterday. I knew that there were some important scenes cut from the movie but it didn't matter to me because I know they will be there in the extended version dvd set. It was fantastic to see Aragorn become who he was born to be, it was his courage and belief in Frodo that inspired many of the others to continue on. I think anyone would want someone like Sam to be their friend, his friendship had more power than the ring itself. I honestly can't decide which of the three are my favourites because I love them all, but this definitely is a trilogy that I'll never forget.",10,0,0,29 December 2003
Honey," not that bad...
","After reading a lot of the reviews on this board, I thought this movie was going to be really bad however I found that this movie isn't really as terrible as some people have made it out to be. Jessica Alba plays Honey Danies, a hip-hop dance teacher hoping to make it as a choreographer, for someone who didn't have any previous dance experience, she sure does a fantastic job! Mekhi Pfifer is good in his supporting role as the barber with a lot of heart.This movie is something that has been done many times before so you can't expect an oscar nominated screenplay etc etc. However, its something you can enjoy and if you are into the music or dancing, then this is definitely something for youa 6/10",6,15,21,3 July 2004
